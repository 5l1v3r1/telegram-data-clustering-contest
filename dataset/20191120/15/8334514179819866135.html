      <p>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The two companies vying to purchase British food delivery service Just Eat traded barbs on Wednesday, as technology company Prosus and Takeaway.com each sought to win over a critical mass of shareholders.</p>

      <p>Prosus said Takeaway.com’s all-share bid, which runs from Wednesday through Dec. 11 and is recommended by the Just Eat board, presents “significant risks” and underestimates how competitive the British market is.</p>
      <p>The broadsides came after a two-week period in which Takeaway’s share price has rallied to a point where its offer nearly matches Prosus’s 4.9 billion pound ($6.3 billion) cash bid, erasing the advantage Prosus hoped to gain when it first launched its unsolicited bid in October.</p>
      <p>Takeaway’s offer, which would see its founder Jitse Groen become CEO of the combined group, valued Just Eat at 698 pence or 4.76 billion pounds ($6.14 billion) as of the close of trade on Tuesday, according to Reuters calculations.</p>
      <p>Just Eat shares traded at 753.4 pence at 1422GMT on Wednesday, signalling that shareholders believe a higher bid by one or the other side is likely. Prosus’s offer also ends Dec. 11 and both are conditional on receiving 75% of shares.</p>
      <p>Prosus, which is controlled by South African investment giant Naspers Ltd., said in a statement that Takeaway’s offer “takes a narrow view of the food delivery sector based principally on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany.”</p>
      <p>These markets “have so far been relatively insulated” from competition of the likes of Uber Eats and Deliveroo, it added.</p>
      <p>In a response, Takeaway said it had become the biggest in seven of its markets “fighting the same competitors Just Eat faces in the UK”.</p>
      <p>Takeaway has played on its experience in the sector and argues its bid will create a global powerhouse in food ordering, and save the combined group 20 million euros in costs over time.</p>
      <p>“Being an operator is clearly different from being a financial investor,” it said in an emailed statement.</p>
      <p>Just Eat’s board has recommended shareholders reject the Prosus bid saying it “significantly undervalues” the company.</p>
      <p>Prosus, which owns stakes in food-ordering companies around the globe, said on Wednesday it doubted Takeaway can roll-out its own delivery service in Britain with no impact on the bottom line and with only tens of millions of investment.</p>
      <p>In a Nov. 12 statement, Takeaway forecast costs “in the tens of millions”, to reposition the combined group for long term growth, including by strengthening its delivery service in Britain.</p>
      <p>Groen’s strategy in the Netherlands and Germany has centred on becoming the dominant platform for food ordering, with food delivery seen as a supplementary business with worse economics.</p>
      <p>Takeaway shares have rallied 17% from a recent low on Nov. 5.</p>
