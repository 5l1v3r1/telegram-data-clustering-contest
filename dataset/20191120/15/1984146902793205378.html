      <h1>Jobs alert as Atom Bank looks to fill 40 roles at County Durham headquarters</h1>
      <h2>The digital bank is gearing up to create a raft of new products and services</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:37:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathon Manning</a></address>
      <p>County Durham’s Atom Bank has kicked off a recruitment drive by announcing it is creating 40 jobs as the business prepares to launch new products.</p>
      <p>The digital-only bank - which is based at The Rivergreen Centre, in Aykley Heads - is looking to hire staff to work in a range of tech, data, and analyst roles.</p>
      <p>The majority of the 40 new members of staff will be based at the company’s North East headquarters, where it currently employs around 365 people.</p>
      <p>Mark Mullen, Atom Bank’s CEO, said: “We are getting on for three years trading now. Over that time we have raised £450m of capital, we have grown from six founders to 365 people and by the end of the financial year we will have nearly 400 people. Today we are recruiting 40 people, and 20 of those roles are in change and technology.</p>
      <p>“The majority of those roles are based here and the majority of people occupying those roles are based here.”</p>
      <p>Atom Bank is looking to find staff to work as engineers that can focus on its website reliability, its DevOps as well as work on its iOS and Android apps.</p>

      <p>Outside of its tech division, the challenger bank is also looking to hire data scientists and business analysts.</p>
      <p>Mr Mullen added that his company was now large enough to begin hiring less experienced members of staff so that it can train them on the job and develop its own future workforce.</p>
      <p>He said: “There is always a balance between having really experienced people and having an agenda to grow and develop your own talent. We want to open up those jobs a lot for graduates that don’t necessarily have five years experience under their belt.</p>
      <p>“We want to be able engineer all our own technology and solutions ourselves from this building.”</p>
      <p>Atom Bank is also gearing up to increase its number of products and hopes to have a full offering in the next three years.</p>
      <p>Currently the bank offers fixed rate savings accounts, mortgages and business loans. Its portfolio includes £2.4bn worth of mortgages and £210m of secured business lending.</p>
      <p>In August the company received a £10m Banking Competition Remedies grant which it is using to create unsecured business lending products to its customers. Atom is investing £15m of its own money into the project, which will go live by 2020.</p>
      <p>In an effort to compete with mainstream banks, Atom also intends to offer payment services to its customers by the first quarter of 2021. It is in the process of testing its technology for this service.</p>
      <p>Mr Mullen added: “We want to develop the business towards profitability. We want to grow our employees’ capabilities and skills. We want to be a full service bank offering in the UK based in the North East. Just because they are 100 years old doesn’t mean the big banks should have it their own way.”</p>
