            <b>Aus Vs PAK Dream11 : Australia look to keep their unblemished record at the ground intact when they square off against Pakistan in the series opener.  </b>
          </p>
          <p>Fresh off having tasted consummate success in the longest format of the game as they retained the Ashes test series trophy after the series ended level on 2-2, Australia make an advent into the two match test series against Pakistan today looking to resonate the same rampant showings. The side enter the land of the upcoming series as overwhelming favourites, a side which is expected to trounce and rout the visiting side on familiar home conditions.</p>
          <p>For Australia, this series comes bearing with it immense ramifications owing not just the fact that it is part of the World Test Championship but also the shot at redemption it offers Australia. The side were defeated 1-0 by Pakistan in the last test series the two sides partook in back in 2018, a result they’ll be looking to overhaul come this two match series which comes offering with it 120 points in the test championship as well.</p>

                <p>And with Australia having turned a new page from their disastrous time in the cricketing fraternity in 2018, the side will be quietly confident of sweeping this series as well. What adds to the intrigue of today’s series opener is the 30 year long unbeaten spree Australia come bearing at the Gabba, one the side will be looking to keep intact with a comprehensive and clinical result at a track which has traditionally always favoured them.</p>
                <p> “It’s important that we start to play more consistently, regardless of the surface. We can’t wait to come to the Gabba, knowing that Australian sides play well and win a lot of Test matches here. We have to be able to do it on any surface and any venue, and that’s something we are building towards,” said Australia’s captain Tim Paine prior to this encounter.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>The wicket laid out over here has been traditionally a one which immensely plays out in favour of the quicks for the first two days and the pictures emerging preceding to the match promise us to be in for reminiscent conditions. The new ball pacers are going to ruffle the batsmen and leave them in remorse with the side seeing the coin turn its way bound to step out and field first.</p>

                            <h3>Aus Vs PAK Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Scoring a resolute and defiant 61 the last time these two teams had met in the test cricket circuit sees us go in for Australia’s Tim Paine in this facet of our side. He comes in not only owing to his role in the side’s batting order but also the fact that he’ll be heavily involved with the gloves as well as his side send Pakistan packing to the pavilion.</p>
                            <h3>Aus Vs PAK Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Even before we had approached this facet of our side’s Dream 11 setup, there was one name we knew we were going to imbed and hammer down into our side for the day. Australia’s Steve Smith was in imperious touch in England, scoring the one 200, two 100s and three 50s as he left England flummoxed and exasperated on how to send him packing to make the Australian bat an instant name for us this segment.</p>
                            <p>Joes Burns comes in as well while from Pakistan elsewhere we have opted for the two names in the form of Babar Azam and Asad Shafiq, two names who’ll be asked to hold fort for their side. With Australia’s bowling order making for such an ominous viewing, these two will be asked to not only rake up runs but more importantly ensure the side doesn’t endure an exodus of wickets which is looking to be an extremely realistic likelihood.</p>
                            <h3>Aus Vs PAK Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Across their time out in England, if there was one player from Australia who managed to grow immensely in stature and emerge as a stalwart to nail down his spot in the team’s unit, it was Marnus Labuschagne. The all-rounder was in succulent touch with the bat, showing tenacity when needed and opening his arms as per need to amass a bagful of runs to make him our pick from the side today.</p>
                            <p>From Pakistan on the other hand we have selected for the singular pick with Iftikhar Ahmed coming in to wrap up the curtains on this department of our Dream 11 outfit.</p>
                            <h3>Aus Vs PAK Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Given the magnitude of grass being left on this surface, this wicket looks set to be one where Australia’s trivalent of pace bowlers will be wrecking havoc on Pakistan’s batting unit. We begin with Mitchell Starch, someone who took 10 wickets against Tasmania and the 4-57 against Western Australia in the ensuing contest, numbers which were enough to push us towards his selection.</p>
                            <p>Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins come in as well with the indomitable and destructive duo making for must haves as we opt for the entire trio of options from Australia’s pace unit while form Pakistan we are picking up Mohammad Abbas. The player has snagged the 14 wickets in 66 matches and was pivotal to Pakistan winning the previous test series between the two the last time around, a name who the side will be banking on to deliver another outright incisive display.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>No hesitations in making Smith our captain for the tie while Labuschagne has been selected as the vice-captain.</p>
