      <h1>Boris Johnson puts tax breaks for high earners on back burner</h1>
      <h2>PM sets out ‘ultimate ambition’ to raise national insurance threshold to £12,500</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:27:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author">Delphine Strauss, George Parker</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson has told high earners they will have to wait for his promised tax breaks if he wins the election, vowing instead to focus on cuts to national insurance payments to help those on lower incomes struggling with the cost of living.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson set out the “ultimate ambition” to raise the threshold for national insurance payments to £12,500, a move that would cost the exchequer at least £11bn, but would be spread over an unspecified number of years.</p>
      <p>An initial commitment to raise the NI threshold to £9,500 next April would put an extra £104 into the pockets of 31m workers at a cost of £2.8bn a year. Mr Johnson said his plan would give a “tax cut for everyone”.</p>
      <p>The first step in the plan would be eliminating a tax of 12 per cent on income above £8,632 up to the new starting point, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. If the threshold was ultimately raised to £12,500, the gains for low income workers would rise to £464 a year.</p>
      <p>The prime minister had previously promised big income tax cuts for those earning more than £50,000, and cuts to stamp duty, while chancellor Sajid Javid had said he was interested in cutting inheritance tax.</p>
      <blockquote>The priority must be to help those who need help with the cost of living<cite>Boris Johnson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>But Mr Johnson, speaking on a campaign visit in the north-east, declared: “The priority must be to help those who need help with the cost of living.”</p>
      <p>The policy will be confirmed in the Tory manifesto to be published on Sunday.</p>
      <p>New fiscal rules set out by Mr Javid this month have curbed Mr Johnson’s ability to offer large unfunded tax cuts, and the prime minister has decided to focus his limited fiscal firepower on low earners.</p>
      <p>The policy is designed to appeal to voters in key target seats in the West Midlands and north of England, but will frustrate traditional Tory voters on higher earnings. Mr Johnson asked for patience: “It doesn’t mean there may not be more to come,” he said.</p>
      <p>During the Tory leadership contest Mr Johnson proposed a £9bn a year tax cut for higher earners by raising the threshold for the higher rate tax band from £50,000 to £80,000.</p>
      <p>He also advocated a £3.3bn cut in stamp duty by raising the threshold for the tax to sales of houses worth more than £500,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Javid won a battle with some of Mr Johnson’s advisers at the start of the election campaign by insisting the party must retain some fiscal credibility; new fiscal rules require him to balance the budget on day-to-day spending within three years.</p>

      <p>That left him with fiscal headroom of about £5bn, although that has been topped up by Mr Johnson’s decision to shelve plans to cut corporation tax rates from 19 per cent to 17 per cent — saving £6bn that could be used for higher spending or tax cuts. On Tuesday, the prime minister promised the NHS would receive the extra money.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson’s national insurance policy was announced in chaotic circumstances after he blurted out the flagship manifesto promise in an engineering shed on Teesside under questioning from a member of the audience.</p>
      <p>He said the party would be “cutting national insurance up to £12,000”, if it won the general election on December 12, although Tory officials later said the target was £12,500.</p>
