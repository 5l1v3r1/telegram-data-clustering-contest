        <li>About <a href="https://www.bowery.org/homelessness/">one in 121</a> New Yorkers is currently experiencing homelessness.</li>
        <li>The city is recording some of the <a href="https://www.coalitionforthehomeless.org/basic-facts-about-homelessness-new-york-city/">highest levels of homelessness</a> since the Great Depression, largely driven by a lack of affordable housing.</li>
        <li>In 2019, about <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dhs/downloads/pdf/dailyreport.pdf">more than 60,000</a> people slept in the city’s shelter system, while an estimated <a href="https://www.bowery.org/homelessness/">4,000</a> slept on the streets, subways, or other public areas.</li>
        <li>We spent a day and night with a mechanic named Moustafa in September 2017 to see what it was really like.</li>

      <p>Take a walk through any borough of New York City and you’re likely to encounter people living on the street.</p>
      <p>There’s a vast diversity to the people living without secure housing, and the various situations they find themselves in.</p>
      <p>In central Brooklyn, a flashpoint of gentrification in the city, we met Moustafa, then a 48-year-old mechanic who lost his shop and his home in 2014.</p>
      <p>Moustafa lived nearby in a community of about a dozen homeless mechanics who live out of their vehicles and try to get work when they can. He invited us to spend the day and night with him to get a glimpse into what it’s really like to be homeless in New York.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we saw.</p>

      <h3>When we first met Moustafa in September 2017, he was changing the the brakes on a car in the parking lot he lived in for a seemingly affluent customer. The area is full of industrial parking lots full of diesel trucks and small buses. He and his fellow homeless mechanics often do work for customers in them.</h3>

      <h3>The lot had a number of small buses and vans parked in it that Moustafa said many of the homeless in the area lived in. Some people had built out patio areas in front of their vehicles with plants, flowers, and equipment for work.</h3>

      <h3>Moustafa moved to the US from Mali nearly 20 years ago and had run his own auto shop for many years until 2014. Moustafa lost his shop after a new landlord raised his rent and he couldn’t make the payments. He was evicted not long after.</h3>

      <h3>He said he could earn $600 in a good week doing repairs in the lot. He makes a lot less in a bad week, and he makes nothing during the winter because there’s no roof over the lot.</h3>

      <h3>After Moustafa finished up the car, another man walked in the lot to use a hose there. The lot, and the entire block, was very fluid: people came and went, and it was hard to decipher who was living on the block and who had homes.</h3>

      <h3>Moustafa said he’d been living in a small bus in the lot for about a year. Before that he tried staying in a shelter, but left after a month because he needed his “own space to breathe.”</h3>

      <h3>The shelter rooms are about as big as the rectangular slab of concrete below, Moustafa said. “They treat you like an animal,” he added.</h3>

      <h3>There were other aspects of the shelters that he didn’t like, he said, like the strict rules about entering and leaving and the health of those staying there. “They don’t check their health,” he said. “I prefer to be in the streets.”</h3>

      <h3>There’s a strong sense of community among those living in the lots. Two fellow mechanics asked Moustafa if he could help them change a fuse. Moustafa obliged, and I followed them to the lot next door.</h3>

      <h3>After waiting for a bit, I offered to get them coffee, figuring the maintenance would take awhile. By the time I got back, Moustafa had the truck running. When I asked him later if the two guys were good mechanics, he said, “I taught them.”</h3>

      <h3>Once inside the van, I immediately saw his dilemma with staying in the shelters. Moustafa has a lot of stuff, and he can’t afford to put it in storage, nor does he want to. Moustafa’s only other option is to try to get public housing, which is extremely difficult. The New York City Housing Authority has a waiting list of 260,000 families with a less than 3% turnover rate, a spokesman told Business Insider. Housing generally goes to those with higher “needs priorities” first, like victims of domestic assault.</h3>

      <h3>The wait times for the NYCHA can range from a few weeks to a few years. For someone like Moustafa, it might be closer to the latter. Moustafa’s living space in the bus was tidy and clean, and he told me that he showers behind the bus with a hose.</h3>
