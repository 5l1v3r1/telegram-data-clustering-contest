      <p>Manchester United are <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-would-loan-haaland-back-to-salzburg_379146.html">widely considered</a> as the favourites to sign the 19-year-old, who has scored 26 times in 18 appearances for Salzburg during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Haaland's father, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alf-inge-haaland/"><b>Alf-Inge Haaland</b></a>, has <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/haaland-father-visits-man-united-training-ground_379841.html">reportedly recently visited</a> United's training complex to discuss a switch to the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Bild</i>, a visit to Arsenal has also been made as the London club are just as keen as the Red Devils to sign the Norway international.</p>
      <p>Haaland has scored seven times in just four Champions League outings this season, while he has managed 27 goals in 23 appearances for Salzburg since arriving in January 2019.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus are also all said to be considering a swoop for the Norwegian with Salzburg seemingly facing a losing battle to keep him.</p>
