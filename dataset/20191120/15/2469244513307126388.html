      <h2>There were several reports of the latex clad gimp over the summer</h2>

      <p>Police say two men who were arrested in connection with incidents of a masked gimp terrorising a Westcountry village have been released.</p>
      <p>Locals of the sleepy Claverham in Somerset were left terrorised over the summer following several reports that a man clad in a black bodysuit and head mask was approaching people late at night.</p>
      <p>One woman, in her 20s, said she encountered a man in the village who was grunting and breathing heavily.</p>
      <p>The woman says she pushed the person away while screaming, and he ran off, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/local-news/police-issue-update-latex-clad-3554010?_ga=2.126130125.1532029400.1574253204-1735012691.1561448173">Bristol Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The incidents prompted a police response with helicopter and dogs in July.</p>
      <p>Residents spoke of being scared to walk home alone with the latex clad pest on the loose with various stories emerging about freakish encounters.</p>

      <p>Some then speculated the area had been plagued by the 'gimp' for years - with police revealing they had already received numerous reports about the odd behaviour.</p>
      <p>Police have now confirmed the two men have been released without charge - and say there have been no further gimp-related incidents.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for  <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">Avon and Somerset Police</a>  said: “Detectives carried out a thorough investigation into a series of incidents in which a man wearing disguises approached people in the Claverham/Yatton area.</p>
      <p>“Two men, aged 28 and 34, were arrested on suspicion of indecency offences but due to insufficient evidence were later released with no further action taken against them.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, we’ve not received any more reports of similar incidents since the most recent report of a man wearing a black body suit approaching a woman on 11 July."</p>
      <p>Speaking after an incident in July, one victim said she was afraid to go out following her brush with the leather-suited man.</p>
      <p>She told the BBC: "Everything was running through my head. I thought: 'This is it, I'm going to get attacked'.</p>
      <p>She added that she had been left feeling "panicked" by the ordeal, which saw her confronted down a dark lane.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's not just a man jumping out at me going boo. Every time I close my eyes I just see that face."</p>
