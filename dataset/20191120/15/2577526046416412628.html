      <h1>Infinity Ward is Still Trying to Fix Modern Warfare's Busted-Ass Shotgun</h1>

      <p>Infinity Ward is still trying to bring <i>Modern Warfare'</i>s monstrous shotgun under its beck and call. A new patch, released early this week, saw the company hit the hyper-powerful 725 shotgun with yet another round of nerfs - the third set since the game launched less than a month ago.</p>
      <p>When the game first released, it didn't take long before players realised that a few choice attachments could turn the 725 into a some <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/05/call-of-duty-players-have-turned-this-shotgun-into-a-sniper-rifle">monstrous sniper/shotgun combo</a>, capable of one-shotting opponents from across the map. It already did a lot of damage, but with an already impressive range, adding a scope, a suppressor, and a barrel attachment, it soon had the Call of Duty community up in arms.</p>
      <p>Infinity Ward has already taken action twice before, but the 725 remains comically powerful. The latest nerf reduces long-range damage reduction, as well as adjusting the impact of attachments on the weapon's range. That should help with those long-range snipes, but the developer is also trying to reduce the gun's overall stats, reducing its damage and accuracy when fired from the hip. Given that this has been a thorn in players' sides for weeks, I'm not 100% sure the changes will do enough to fix the issue, but perhaps it'll be a classic case of third time lucky.</p>
