      <p>Tracy Metcalfe has had the year from hell in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>, so it's reassuring to know the ITV soap is lining up a new romance for the popular character.</p>
      <p>Viewers know that her life was turned upside down in August when her dad <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-gutted-as-frank-clayton-dies-in-factory-fire/">Frank Clayton died in the factory fire</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>As well as witnessing her beloved dad's death in the explosion, the shop assistant also blamed herself as her dad entered the burning building to save her.</p>
      <p>He sacrificed himself for his youngest daughter, who had been hiding in a cupboard to meet lover Billy for a 'quickie'.</p>
      <aside>There's a flirtation going on between Tracy and Pete at the moment, so I'm hoping she'll get some kind of happiness there.</aside>
      <p>Tracy also discovered that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-fuming-as-amy-and-kerry-get-away-with-starting-factory-fire/">Kerry Wyatt and her daughter Amy were to blame</a> for starting the fire, but agreed to keep the secret quiet - for now.</p>

      <p>After a nightmarish few months dealing with the grief of losing her dad, Tracy is set for some happiness at last as scriptwriters give her a new romance in upcoming scenes - and some <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-predict-romance-for-tracy-metcalfe-and-pete-barton/">viewers have already noticed the bond between the pair</a>.</p>
      <p>Tracy will find herself attracted to handsome Pete towards the end of this year, whose <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-beg-soap-not-to-split-up-graham-and-rhona/">ex-girlfriend Rhona Goskirk recently moved on with Graham Foster</a>.</p>
      <p>But Tracy's romance could well be short-lived as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/anthony-quinlans-shock-departure-from-emmerdale-explained-by-writer/">Pete is due to exit the show next year</a>.</p>

      <p>Anthony Quinlan, who has played Pete since 2013, recently <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/anthony-quinlan-has-quit-emmerdale-entertainment-daily/">announced he would be leaving the show</a>, meaning that his fledging relationship with Tracy won't be long term.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The <a href="https://www.insidesoap.co.uk/">Inside Soap</a> Yearbook 2020, Amy said: "There's a flirtation going on between Tracy and Pete at the moment, so I'm hoping she'll get some kind of happiness there.</p>
      <p>"I want her to find love, even if it's not with Pete.</p>
      <p>"I'd love to work with Matthew [Wolfenden] again, but getting back with David isn't the right thing for Tracy. She's too good for him!"</p>

      <p>Tracy and David <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/spoiler-is-it-all-over-for-tracy-and-david-metcalfe/">split up last year</a>, when he struggled to come to terms with her <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/fans-sickened-by-tracy-metcalfes-disgusting-sex-blackmail-plot/">past as a prostitute</a>.</p>
      <p>Although she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/spoiler-tracy-metcalfe-pregnant/">got pregnant</a> with his baby after they split, she aborted it believing it to be for the best.</p>
      <p>David later got together with Maya Stepney, and we all <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-disappointed-with-maya-pregnancy-twist/">know how THAT ended</a>!</p>
