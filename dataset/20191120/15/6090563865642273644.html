      <p>A four year old is feared dead as several other people were injured including three journalists and a policeman in<br/>violence that erupted in Zimbabwe’s capital on Wednesday afternoon between “overzelous” police and opposition MDC supporters.</p>
      <p>The violence occurred midday at MDC Alliance’s headquarters where police unleashed a “reign of terror” to party supporters who had thronged the place to listen to a “hope of the nation” address by President Nelson Chamisa.</p>
      <p>Police allege that MDC blocked a road disrupting traffic flow a claim dismissed as hogwash by the opposition members who view the move as one of the repressive measures by the state to stifle their constitutional right.</p>
      <p>Among the clashes, a four year old child is reported to have died, although the circumstances leading to the death were still unclear by time of writing.</p>
      <p>Media Institute of Southern Africa Zimbabwe chapter, however confirmed the assault of the three reporters.</p>
      <blockquote>“Three journalists were assaulted by police at the MDC Alliance HQ in Harare, Zimbabwe where leader Nelson Chamisa was scheduled to give his ‘Hope of the Nation Address’ today.<br/><br/>“The journalists are with online publication OpenParly and Community Radio Harare (CORAH).<br/><br/>“OpenParly’s Daniel Chigundu told MISA Zimbabwe that he was assaulted at MDC Alliance headquarters, also known as Morgan Richard Tsvangirai House, together with his colleague who is also an intern with the publication, Loreen Tadzingwa while live-streaming the proceedings.<br/><br/>“Ranganai Zimunya of CORAH, which is a community radio initiative, was also similarly assaulted, despite displaying his accreditation card.<br/><br/>“The journalists were assaulted as the police started dispersing people that had gathered at the MDC Alliance headquarters,” said Misa in a statement.<br/><br/>“According to Chigundu, their pleas that they were journalists were ignored by the police.”</blockquote>
      <p>A police officer also rued the day he was recruited after being assaulted by the angry mob that was baying for his blood.</p>
