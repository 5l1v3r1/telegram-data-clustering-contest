      <h1>Emmerdale: Six best theories over what will happen next in Maya Stepney pregnancy plot</h1>
      <h2>Maya is pregnant - but who's the father?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:33:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Rodrigues</a></address>
      <p>Last night <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> made a fleeting return to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale </a>and viewers were stunned to see she has been released from prison and is pregnant!</p>
      <p>Viewers know the former schoolteacher <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/emmerdale-fans-want-to-throw-up-as-maya-resumes-affair-with-jacob-in-unwatchable-scenes/">groomed her pupil</a> <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>, who also happened to be her boyfriend David's son, into believing they were in a loving relationship.</p>
      <p>She even began sleeping with the schoolboy just days after he turned 16.</p>
      <p>After she was caught out, she was eventually sentenced to 12 months in prison, however she was released after five.</p>

      <p>Last night viewers saw Jacob ring Maya to tell her he still loved her and wanted to be with her, but he ended up leaving her a voicemail.</p>
      <p>As she left prison, Maya deleted Jacob's phone contact details and as the camera panned down it <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-stunned-as-maya-returns-pregnant/">revealed she is pregnant!</a></p>
      <p>So what's going to happen next in this plot?</p>
      <p>Here are six of the best theories...</p>
      <h3>1. Is Jacob the father of Maya's baby?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Maya began sleeping with Jacob days after his 16th birthday, which was back in February.</p>
      <p>They were together right up<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoiler-maya-finally-arrested/"> until her arrest in May</a> and although we don't know how far along Maya is into her pregnancy, there is a strong chance that Jacob could be the baby's father.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But if Jacob is the dad, it would mean a connection between him and Maya forever.</p>
      <p>Fans <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-disappointed-with-maya-pregnancy-twist/">have slammed the soap for this idea</a>, so perhaps Jacob won't be the father after all...</p>
      <h3>2. Is David the father of Maya's baby?</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Viewers know Maya was in a relationship with<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-david-metcalfe/"> David Metcalfe</a> while she groomed his son Jacob.</p>
      <p>Maya <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-horrified-for-jacob-over-maya-sex-scene/">was sleeping with both David</a> and Jacob meaning there is also the possibility of David being the baby's father.</p>
      <p>However, whether he or Jacob will ever find out Maya's baby remains a secret.</p>
      <p>On the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/">Entertainment Daily</a> Facebook page, a user commented: "Think it will be David's baby."</p>
      <p>A second said: "I think it's David's baby."</p>
      <p>A third said: "I expect it's David's."</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Jessiebobbs/status/1196881220585578497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>It would certainly make for dramatic times ahead if the baby was David's - would he be able to give up seeing his child to keep Maya away from Jacob?</p>
      <p>Or could he fight for custody of the little one and bring them to live with him - a constant reminder of the trauma they all went through?</p>
      <h3>3. Is Maya's ex-husband Liam the father of her child?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Fans of the show know when Maya originally came into Emmerdale she was married to Doctor Liam Cavanagh and was stepmother to his daughter Leanna.</p>
      <p>Eventually, she started having an affair with David, and Maya and Liam split.</p>
      <p>However, when David announced that Maya was a paedophile,<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-liam-and-leanna-to-bring-maya-down/"> Liam looked shifty leading viewers to think he knew something about it</a>.</p>
      <p>But what if it's because he was still sleeping with his ex-wife too?</p>
      <aside>I think it's Liam's baby and that this is the 'devastating' news that will tear Bernice and Liam apart.</aside>
      <p>Spoilers for next week tell us that, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-a-shock-revelation-throws-bernice-and-liams-wedding-into-jeopardy/">a shock revelation throws Liam and Bernice's wedding into jeopardy</a>.</p>
      <p>Could the secret be that Maya is pregnant with Liam's baby?</p>
      <p>On the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentdailyfix/">Entertainment Daily Facebook page</a>, one user commented: "I think it's Liam's baby and that this is the 'devastating' news that will tear Bernice and Liam apart.</p>
      <p>"Bernice's exit will be that she leaves Emmerdale and goes to live with her daughter Dee Dee!"</p>
      <p>A second said: "Liam's baby."</p>

      <h3>4. Will Maya ever be seen again?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>A spokesperson for Emmerdale told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-no-return-planned-for-maya-stepney-amid-pregnancy-twist-11184975/">Metro.co.uk</a> that: "There are no current plans for Maya to return."</p>
      <p>Website <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/a29854375/emmerdale-spoilers-is-maya-stepney-returning/">Digital Spy</a> also reached out to Emmerdale and a spokesperson elaborated: "Louisa filmed that scene earlier this year when she was still with us.</p>
      <p>"There continue to be no current plans for the character of Maya to return."</p>
      <p>This seems to solidify that it was a fleeting comeback and that Maya won't be seen again for a long time.</p>
      <p>Does this mean viewers will never find out who the father of her baby is?</p>
      <h3>5. Will Maya return to the village in the future with her baby</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Although Maya has been warned not to return to the village and legally isn't allowed to contact Jacob, it's always possible she could return in the distant future.</p>
      <p>Maybe even she doesn't know who the father is and she'll return with her child for a DNA test?</p>
      <h3>6. Will Maya's baby return without her?</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>An ED! theory that we're throwing out there is whilst we may never see Maya again, we could see her child way in the future.</p>
      <p>Although it looks like Maya may never return, when her child gets older, they may become curious as to who their father is leading to them arriving in the village.</p>
      <p>Or Maya could die in an off-screen accident leading to the baby to be sent to live with its real dad (something Emmerdale has done plenty of times before -<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoiler-jais-son-makes-a-shock-return-to-the-village-as-rachel-dies/"> just ask young Archie Sharma</a>).</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, it looks like this storyline is far from over...</p>
