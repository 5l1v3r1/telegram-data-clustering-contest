      <p>Flagging emails on an <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111919_unflag-all-emails-on-iphone&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-64gb-black-verizon%2F6341340.p%3FskuId%3D6341340">iPhone</a> is one of the easiest ways to keep track of messages that require a follow-up, or that you don’t want to lose track of in an overcrowded inbox.</p>
      <p>With just a tap, you can immediately see all those messages in one place and work your way through them, sending responses where needed or completing any requests they might contain.</p>
      <p>However, sometimes it’s easy to forget to unflag emails when you’re done with them, leaving you with a bunch of messages you no longer need flagged. When that happens, you can unflag all of them at once in a few simple steps.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to do it.</p>
