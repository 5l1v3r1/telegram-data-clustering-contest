      <h1>Mystery letter about missing man Jordan Moray sparks fresh police appeal</h1>
      <h2>Jordan Moray was reported missing on August 2 and new information has come to light</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:53:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Katie-Ann Gupwell</a></address>
      <p>Police are urging a man to come forward after a letter was received following the disappearance of Jordan Moray.</p>
      <p>Jordan, 32, was <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/jordan-moray-missing-brecon-aberdare-16720510">reported missing on August 2 by his family</a> , having last been seen by them on July 24.</p>
      <p>The alarm was raised after concerned relatives visited his flat to find it unsecure with a gaming machine left on and his door unsecure.</p>
      <p>His phone was also left at the address.</p>
      <p>A friend of Jordan’s reported seeing him on July 29 in Bro Deg, Cwmbach.</p>
      <p>Despite extensive searches being carried out in the area Jordan, from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/aberdare">Aberdare</a> , is yet to have been found.</p>
      <p>Officers are now appealing to a man named Kevin Humphreys, and are urging him to get in touch.</p>
      <p>Kevin recently wrote to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/south-wales-police">South Wales Police</a> and provided some information which officers believe may help their ongoing investigation. The details of the letter have not been disclosed.</p>
      <p>However, it's hoped Mr Humphreys may be able to assist with further information as Jordan has now been missing for more than three months.</p>

      <p>Detective Inspector Dai Cole, who is investigating Jordan’s disappearance, said: “Hopefully, Mr Humphreys, or somebody who knows him, will see this appeal and make contact.</p>
      <p>“In his letter, he provided information which could be significant without him realising it.</p>
      <p>“Jordan’s disappearance is a mystery and any new leads which may help us understand where he is at this time will be helpful.</p>
      <p>“We know Jordan enjoys walking in places such as Cwmbach, the wider Aberdare area and as far afield as Brecon.</p>
      <p>"It is not unusual for Jordan to walk in excess of 20 miles a day, usually off the beaten track on mountain trails.</p>
      <p>"With this in mind, I would like to direct my appeal to those who also enjoy the outdoors, who may share his enjoyment of the same things and places.”</p>
      <p>Anyone who may have any information is urged to contact 101 and give reference *284205.</p>
      <p>Alternatively you can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
