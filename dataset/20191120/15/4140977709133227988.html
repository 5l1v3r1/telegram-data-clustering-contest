            <b>ENG Vs NZ Dream11 : England look to put behind them a horrid Ashes test series as they take on the home side in the first match of the series today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>They might have ended up winning the ODI Cricket World cup but when the narrative turned towards the longest format of the game, it was blatantly evident that England still have a long way to go. The side were thumped and demolished by Australia in their own home and although they did manage to rescue the series to restore parity in the final encounter and tally it up at 2-2, the result was an inconsequential one with Australia retaining the prestigious trophy.</p>
          <p>It lead it England changing their coach with Chris Silverwood coming in along with a complete overhaul of the test cricket setup in the country, one which sees a slew of new players being handed over chances in this series. The batting order has been majorly played around with as the side look to recover from the brunt of being battered and rattled with the visitors well aware of the formidable threat New Zealand’s quicks offer this series.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere for New Zealand, although this series is not part of the World Test Championship, the side will be looking to use the two matches as a test of their perseverance, resolve, fortitude and guile in red ball cricket. Up against a worldclass side, the hosts know that a win in the series would do massive favours to their credentials as a test cricket playing country.</p>
                <p>The match looks largely one which will be decided by the visiting side’s batters and New Zealand’s feisty and fiery pace attack. It promises to be a thriller of a contest, a match which pays immense respect to the truest format of cricket and regales us in an enthralling and intriguing encounter between two sides who are familiar faces.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Being the first test match to be contested on this surface, the wicket is a relatively unknown entity but the whispers stemming from the people associated with the stadium tout this to be a track where the quick will get assistance on the first two days. However, apart from that, this is a wicket which is majorly going to favour the batsmen with the boundaries relatively easy to find once the bats have settled into their groove.</p>
                      <p>The side winning the toss will be looking to come out and field first and allow their quicks to make early headway into the opposition’s batting order.</p>

                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>ENG Vs NZ Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to venture into this encounter with the pick of BJ Watling from New Zealand. The player is not only a safe pair of gloves but someone who can come out and show application and technique during his stay as a bat in the middle as well.</p>
                            <h3>ENG Vs NZ Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>We had to begin this docket of our side with the selection of Kane Williamson from New Zealand. The side’s captain is a true test cricket batsman, someone whose willingness to parry away the balls will not only make him extremely comfortable against the deviating new ball but also massively perturb England’s bowling unit who will find it extremely tepid to breach his guard.</p>
                            <p>Ross Taylor will be partnering him up for the day whilst from England we are beginning with opener Rory Burns with newcomer Dominic Sibley partnering him up for the day. This might be Sibley’s first match in English colors but the player comes bearing a gargantuan tag with the batter being highly revered in England’s cricketing circuit given the behemoth of runs he’s tallied up at the domestic level.</p>
                            <h3>All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>With Sam Curran getting the go ahead to represent England as the quick all-rounder in place of Chris Woakes, the player makes an instant foray into the docket of our Dream 11 side. He picked up three wickets in the practice match played prior to this series and with him being someone who is more than capable of wielding the bat fruitfully as well, the player is someone who comes bearing with him sublime value.</p>
                            <p>From New Zealand meanwhile we have decided to move in with Mitchell Santner with the spinner bound to perturb and perplex the English unit. England have traditionally always been distressed by the rank turners and with Santner being someone who can persistently send down the ball in the right channels, the bowler is set to make regular inroads come today.</p>
                            <h3>Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Test cricket, a cover of green left on the surface and the standout names lining up this segment meant we have to go in with the four bowlers in this section of our side. We are getting the two players apiece from either side with us beginning with the frontline quicks from New Zealand by making Trent Boult and Tim Southee our choices for this one.</p>
                            <p>The two are bowlers who can move the ball ether way and will be eyeing themselves up against a relatively new look and inexperienced English bowling unit. Elsewhere, our picks from England are akin to the choices from the home side with us moving in for Stuart Broad and spinner Jake Leach with Leach being more than capable of stringing together pivotal runs down the lower middle-order as well.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Williamson will be our side’s captain for this encounter while we are moving in with Boult as the vice-captain.</p>
