        <b>Colm Cavanagh is returning for another year with Tyrone's senior footballers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former All-Star midfielder, who was part of their 2008 All-Ireland winning team, will be playing inter-county for a 14th season.</p>
      <p>Reports had suggested that the 32-year-old Moy club man would call time on his career after the Red Hand's defeat to Kerry in the semi-finals of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.</p>
      <p>But manager Mickey Harte says the two-time All-Star is back and he's pleased to have a "stalwart" still available and feels Kavanagh's experience will be crucial to the panel.</p>
      <p>“The rumours were a bit off the mark. He hasn’t retired, he’s prepared to give it a lash, and we’re all pleased that that’s the case,” <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/11/20/news/colm-cavanagh-set-for-another-tyrone-campaign-1770260/">Harte told The Irish News</a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s been a great stalwart for this team, and a very versatile player.</p>
      <p>“He has a lot of experience that we can ill-afford to do with out at the minute.</p>
      <p>“Colm has a lot of experience and he has a lot of the attributes necessary for a midfielder-come-sweeper type player.</p>
      <p>“He has worked hard on that over the years, and I suppose he’s the man who has played it more than anyone else, and that has put him ahead of the posse, so to speak.”</p>
