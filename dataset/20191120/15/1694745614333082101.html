      <p>Well, folks, we can go ahead and add Josh Gad to the list of people who are obsessed with Idina Menzel. On Tuesday's episode of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Late-Late-Show-with-James-Corden"><b>The Late Late Show With James Corden</b></a>, the 38-year-old actor gushed about his <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Frozen-2"><b>Frozen 2</b></a> costar, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/kristen-bell-idina-menzel-walk-fame-ceremony-pictures-46917326">revealing his love for Idina</a> started when he saw her in <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Rent"><b>Rent</b></a> and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/Wicked"><b>Wicked</b></a>. Not only did Josh sing Idina's praises, but he literally <i>sang</i> Idina's praises.</p>
      <p>Attesting to her powerful vocals, Josh did a few emulations of the actress crooning <b>Rent's</b> "Over the Moon" and <b>Wicked</b>'s "Defying Gravity," and James could hardly hold his composure. "I will say, the impressions are uncanny. If I shut my eyes . . ." he joked before closing his eyes as Josh continued to impersonate his cast mate. Even Anna Camp, who was the other guest of the evening, was impressed. "So good!" she said, laughing. "I'm so turned on right now." Watch Josh transform into his fellow Disney star in the clip above!</p>
