      <p>Google today announced new creation tools in Google Earth that will allow you to create a map or story about the places around the world. With these new tools, you will be able to draw your own placemarks, lines and shapes, even attach custom text, images, and videos to locations. Google Earth also allows you to organize your story into a narrative and collaborate with others. Once the story creation is done, use the new “Present” button to share it with others. The audience can fly from place to place in your custom-made Google Earth narrative.</p>
      <blockquote>For nearly 15 years, people have turned to Google Earth for a comprehensive view of our planet. But our mission has never been to just show you a static picture of the planet; we want to bring the world to life. With new creation tools now in Google Earth, you can turn our digital globe into your own storytelling canvas, and create a map or story about the places that matter to you.</blockquote>
      <p>Google Earth Creation tools are now available in Google Earth on web. You can view your projects on mobile and tablet devices using the latest version of Google Earth iOS and Android app.</p>
