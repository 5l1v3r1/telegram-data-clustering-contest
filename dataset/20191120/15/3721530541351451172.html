      <p>If you got a weird email from Electronic Arts this morning about an activation on your Origin account, congratulations. No, you haven’t been hacked. In fact your account is more secure than most, and you’re being rewarded for that with free games.</p>
      <p>Here’s what’s going on.</p>
      <p>Last month EA announced that those who opted into its two-factor security system, called EA Login Verification, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/account/login-verification-and-origin-access/">would receive a free month of Origin Access Basic</a>. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/1/12/10755814/ea-origin-access-subscription-pc">subscription plan</a> gives folks access to <a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/browse?fq=subscriptionGroup:vault-games&amp;sort=rank%20desc">a big back catalog of games</a>, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/star-wars-battlefront-2/39700"><i>Star Wars Battlefront 2</i></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/battlefield-5/40357"><i>Battlefield 5</i></a>. It’s a nice gesture, especially considering that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/2/9/8006693/the-truth-behind-those-mysteriously-cheap-gray-market-game-codes">Origin’s security has been a bit lax in the past</a>.</p>
      <p>This morning EA flipped the switch, sending out emails to all of the users who qualified. Unfortunately, those emails didn’t clue anyone in on what they were all about.</p>
      <p>“You’ve redeemed an Origin Access Membership Code,” the email states, as received by at least one Polygon editor. Of course, that’s not true; EA essentially redeemed it for you. That slight incongruity in the messaging was enough to cause a small amount of panic among users.</p>

      <p>As we enter the New Year, here’s a friendly reminder to turn on two-factor on all your accounts that support it. Try a password manager to keep track of your many online identities, and use it to generate strong passwords.</p>
      <p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to play the <i>Star Wars</i><i> Battlefront 2 </i>campaign on PC for the next month <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/29/20937981/star-wars-resistance-reborn-book-review">in preparation for <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a>.</p>
