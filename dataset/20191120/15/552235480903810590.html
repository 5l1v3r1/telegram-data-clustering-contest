      <p>Ram raiders escaped with equipment worth a five-figure sum after smashing their way into a Dumfries firm’s warehouse.</p>
      <p>The premises of Brown’s Pressure Washers at the Lochside Industrial Estate were targeted between 5pm on Thursday and 6am on Friday.</p>
      <p>The thieves escaped with a number of pressure washers in the raid.</p>
      <p>Company owner Sam Hughes was alerted to the robbery by a neighbouring trader.</p>
      <p>Gail Bigham from Brown’s told the Standard: “They ram-raided their way through the big swing doors at the entrance to the property and caused quite a lot of damage to one of the doors in the process.</p>
      <p>“There are quite a few pressure washers that have been taken — we’re not quite sure what we’re doing yet but we’re hoping it can be covered by insurance.</p>
      <p>“It will be a financial burden on us for a bit.”</p>
      <p>She added: “The gentleman from a nearby business noticed the damage and phoned our boss and it was a bit frightening to come in to work and see what had happened, so it’s just about getting things secure again.”</p>
      <p>Police have issued a plea for information about the raid on the Irongray Road premises and urged anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>Constable Kelly Douglas said: “We are currently checking CCTV and making enquiries with local businesses but would also wish to alert members of the public to the theft.</p>
      <p>“If you are approached to buy this type of equipment and have any doubts where it comes from, then please contact police. The equipment is bulky and the thieves would require to have used a vehicle, possibly a van, to get away with the haul.</p>
      <p>“If you have any information that will assist officers please contact Dumfries Police via 101. Quote reference 0429.”</p>
