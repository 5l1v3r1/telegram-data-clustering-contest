      <p>Work to set up the first medical college in the hilly Nilgiris district will begin soon, Tamil Nadu Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Centre has sanctioned six medical colleges for Tamil Nadu and one will be established in this tourist town at a cost of Rs 350 crore, he told reporters here.</p>
      <p>As the building of now-defunct Hindustan Photo Films is in good condition, the college will come up there and work is likely to be completed by the end of the year, he said.</p>
      <p>Velumani, who was here to distribute welfare schemes to the tune of Rs 16.45 crore, said the government will sanction 100 green-houses to those affected by the recent rains.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the district administrationâ€™s request to construct two bridges which were washed away in the floods a couple of days ago, at an outlay of Rs 10 crore, will be taken to the Chief Minister for approval, he said.</p>
