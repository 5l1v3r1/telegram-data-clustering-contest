      <p>An elderly woman has been spared jail after attempting to set her bungalow on fire.</p>
      <p>On November 27 last year, Maureen Walsh tried to start the fire in the kitchen of her semi-detached home in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/ellesmere-port">Ellesmere Port</a> .</p>
      <p>Walsh, 82, had made the sink overflow by stuffing a tea towel on the plughole with both taps on full.</p>
      <p>She also placed packets of food on each of the four electric cooker hobs which were all on.</p>
      <p>It was also noted a kettle power cord was deliberately placed trailing in the water-filled sink whilst it was turned on, with the risk it could start an electrical fire.</p>
      <p>Walsh was remanded in custody to Styal prison in the February of this year, where she was cared for by prison staff as her health began to fail significantly.</p>
      <p>She was found not fit to plead or stand trial after medical reports were taken out on Ms Walsh.</p>
      <p>At Chester Crown Court on November 19 Walsh was given a conditional discharge for 12 months.</p>
      <p>Peter Hussey, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This has been a complicated and sad case.</p>
      <p>“Ms Walsh’s social conditions and health needs meant she had carers visiting her daily. Her behaviour was challenging, and the carers visited in pairs as she often became abusive and aggressive.”</p>
      <p>Walsh had previously received a short prison sentence in February earlier this year for other, less serious offences.</p>
      <p>Mr Hussey added: “She initially tried to blame the carers for the fire but also admitted that she’d done it on purpose.</p>
      <p>“The special verdict by the jury meant that only three types of sentences were available to the court – a hospital order, a supervision order, or a conditional discharge.</p>
      <p>"As her mental ill-health was not treatable, and her residence was uncertain, the sentencing options for the Court were very limited.”</p>
