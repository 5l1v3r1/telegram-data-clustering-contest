      <p>GHMCâ€™s enforcement wing, which started a special drive to remove flexis, banners and posters, has on Wednesday, tore down the posters displaying parking fares near the Metro Rail stations too.</p>
      <p>The yellow-coloured posters displaying parking fee for two-wheelers near Metro Rail stations between Dilsukhnagar and L.B.Nagar were removed by the Enforcement teams along with other posters and flexis. The posters were tied to the trees planted on the footpaths. Though the pavements were laid by HMRL, the municipal corporation is well within its right to determine the commercial or other use of them.</p>
      <p>When enquired, the Director, Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management, Viswajit Kampati responded by saying, that he was not aware of the removal, and said he will get it checked.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, GHMC has removed a total of 20,234 illegal posters, banners, and flexis during the drive by Wednesday afternoon. Posters on walls and bus shelters too have been removed, a statement from GHMC said.</p>
      <p>Twenty-four teams have been carrying out the drive across the city. On Wednesday, areas including Raj Bhavan Road, GVK Mall, Assembly, Attapur, Malakpet, Uppal, Gandhi Hospital, Shilparamam, OU Campus, Gachibowli, L.B.Nagar, Punjagutta, and Habsiguda were covered.</p>
