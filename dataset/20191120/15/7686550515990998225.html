      <h1>New Apple Air Pods deal undercuts Amazon's £129 discount</h1>
      <h2>The deal means you can get your hands on Apple Air Pods for just £111 - cheaper than Amazon's deal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:51:30+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Hurrell</a></address>
      <p>Amazon's Black Friday sale has Apple Air Pods listed for £129 but there is a way to get them for even less.</p>
      <p>Amazon surprised many when it cut the price of the expensive Air Pods from their retail price of <a href="https://amzn.to/2KF7cjr">£159 to £129</a> and it proved to be a popular deal for those who did not want to shell out an eye-watering £249 for the noise-cancelling Air Pods Pro.</p>
      <p>Fans of Apple devices should be used to paying for pricey accessories by now but one Black Friday deal could cut the price of the wireless headphones to just £111 - the lowest ever price for the Airpods.</p>
      <p>Laptops Direct has price-matched Amazon with the second generation headphones and charging case <a href="https://fave.co/2QyR0DQ">priced at £129.</a> That is a £30 saving that matches Amazon for the lowest price around.</p>
      <p>However, members of deals website Topcashback can use the service to claim back 2.2% on any purchase at Laptops Direct. The deal represents a saving of £2.80 once the cashback is taken into account.</p>
      <p>The discount may not be enough to entice buyers but <a href="http://track.topcashback.co.uk/SHUh?aff_sub=regional">new users of Topcashback</a> can get an extra £15 cashback when they sign up to Topcashback <a href="http://track.topcashback.co.uk/SHUh?aff_sub=regional">here</a> and then order the headphones via Laptops Direct.</p>
      <p>The £15 cashback, 2.2.% offered to existing members and Laptops Direct's £30 discount means the Apple Air Pods are now priced at just £111.20 once cashback is returned.</p>
      <p>The saving of around £50 means the Air Pods are the cheapest on the market - and undercuts Amazon's Black Friday countdown deal.</p>
      <p>Of course, if £111 is still too expensive for a pair of headphones there are other wireless Apple-compatible pods on the market for a fraction of the price. Wowcher is currently selling Apple and Siri compatible ear buds and a charging case for <a href="https://fave.co/2QDgSP0">just £20</a> , down from £89.99.</p>
