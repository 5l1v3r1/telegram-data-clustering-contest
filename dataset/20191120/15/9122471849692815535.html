      <h1>Paul Finebaum Says He’s ‘Not Impressed’ With These 2 Playoff Contenders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:36:07+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Over the last couple of weeks, much of the debate surrounding the College Football Playoff rankings has centered around Alabama. The Crimson Tide remain at No. 5, despite losing to LSU and losing quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to injury.</p>
      <p>Alabama made the CFP two years ago–eventually winning the national title–despite not winning the SEC West or a conference championship. There’s a chance that the same thing could happen this year.</p>
      <p>In one segment on this morning’s episode of <i>Get Up!</i>, ESPN’s Mike Greenberg, Maria Taylor, David Pollack and Paul Finebaum debated the Tide’s playoff chances. Greenberg said there is “no legitimate way” to put Alabama in, and Taylor argued that an 11-1 Alabama team can’t and won’t get in over a 12-1 Big 12 or Pac-12 champion.</p>
      <p>Pollack and Finebaum aren’t so sure. In fact, Finebaum laid out his case for why Alabama could get in over whoever wins the Pac-12.</p>
      <p>“Quite frankly, I’m not impressed with Oregon and Utah,” Finebaum said. “They’re gonna win the Pac-12, but Alabama could win the Pac-12. I think as you get closer to the examination, you’re going to find that Alabama’s resume is going to trump Oregon and Utah’s with one exception. They will not have a conference championship.”</p>

      <p>Finebaum’s comments provide plenty of fuel for those who dislike him and his SEC bias. However, he’s not the only person who feels that way.</p>
      <p>If Alabama is 11-1 and the Pac-12 winner is 12-1, it will be fascinating to see how the committee handles things.</p>
