        <b>A NEW Scottish cola is hitting the shelves just in time for St Andrew's Day.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Glaswegians Chris Ewing and Niall Holmes of the Caledonian Cola Company have launched the aptly named Alba Cola.</p>

      <p>The drink is designed for people looking for a new cola drinking experience and a contemporary change from the big brands.</p>
      <p>Made with lightly carbonated Scottish water and a buzz of heather botanicals, Alba Cola contains less sugar than large brands and comes packaged in a sleek black can with a gold unicorn, Scotland’s national animal on the front.</p>
      <p>We took to the streets of Glasgow to give punters a taste of the new craft drink and get their thoughts on the fresh taste.</p>
      <p>One person said: "Anything is better than normal coke especially if it's Scottish. I really liked it.</p>

      <p>Another said: "It tastes alright, it's like Coca-Cola, but it's not.</p>
      <p>"It tastes a bit like those weird botanical drinks from Tesco.</p>
      <p>"It tastes dead sweet but it doesn't make your mouth all rotten like normal coke."</p>

        <figcaption>Some thought it was flatter than normal coke</figcaption>

      <p>A third person added: "I can't quite work out the taste of it. It's not as sweet as normal coke which I like.</p>
      <p>"There's like a floral herby feeling. It's nice I like it."</p>
      <p>Another came to the conclusion: "It's different, it tastes a wee bit flat. Maybe it's not cold enough."</p>
      <p>Another member of the public agreed with the flat verdict: "It's actually not bad. It's flatter than normal coke but it's alright."</p>
      <p>And our final sampler thought it was a bit like cider: "It tastes different, it has a kick to it. It is flatter but I think it's more sour.</p>
      <p>"It's not as sweet. Do I like it? Not so much.</p>

      <p>"It has a more cider taste, but a non-alcoholic version. It's more like a juice than a something with fizz to it."</p>
      <p>The idea for the soft drink was born when entrepreneur and ex-Motherwell footballer Chris noticed the popularity of regional colas in France.</p>
      <p>He got together with musician Niall who had been working in the food and drink industry for over 15 years.</p>
      <p>Together they tasted and tweaked the recipe to perfectly balance the heather botanicals in the cola and are now launching what they deem the best cola around.</p>
      <p>Chris explained: “People in France would frequently ask for a cola made from their region over the big brands and I knew there would be a market for the same kind of thing from Scotland with its own wonderful food and drink and culture.</p>
      <p>“Consumers are drinking less alcohol and looking for new premium soft drinks or mixer experiences.</p>
      <p>“It’s a drink to be shared and enjoyed with friends made using some of Scotland’s best natural ingredients, our untouched water and botanicals from one of our most iconic plants.</p>
      <p>"They work so well together in a cola!”</p>
      <p>Niall added: “We are very excited to introduce Alba Cola to the thriving food and drink industry here in Scotland.</p>
      <p>"The reception we are getting when people see and taste it is fantastic.</p>
      <p>“It really is such a versatile cola with a refreshing taste and we look forward to seeing what people think of the world’s favourite soft drink reinvented with a premium Scottish twist.”</p>
      <p>Alba Cola is currently stocked in a range of independent retailers, cafes and bars around Scotland.</p>
