      <p>Former Royal aide Paul Burrell has said that he feels sorry for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/queen-elizabeth-ii/">Queen Elizabeth</a> II amid the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> interview fallout – as she would’ve found out the truth in the papers over breakfast.</p>
      <p>The 93-year-old reigning monarch has a daily routine which includes going through the daily newspapers each day over her morning meal.</p>
      <p>So despite claims Prince Andrew told the Queen the now infamous interview with Emily Maitlis an incredible ‘success’, the truth would have come out the next morning.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Loose Women about his time in the palace, and of Prince Andrew’s friendship with the now-dead sex offender and trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, Paul said that she was the one he felt sympathy for most.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve never really known him and that’s the honest truth. I feel sorry for the victims of this paedophile [Epstein], that’s where my sympathy goes,’ he told the panel.</p>

      <p>‘I also feel sorry for Her Majesty who’s 93 years old. Every morning I would set out her newspapers on her breakfast table, still happens to this day.’</p>
      <p>‘She sees the papers, all of them, they’re not censored from her. She sees everything, and I feel sorry that she has to see this,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘She’s a 93-year-old mum and she has to put up with this.’</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew’s Newnight interview, in which he discussed his friendship with Epstein as well as defended accusations of his own, has become the national talking point.</p>
      <p>In the discussion, Andrew attempted to debunk claims that he had sexually engaged with then 17-year-old Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre) – claiming <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">he was with his daughter at Pizza Express that day</a>.</p>
      <p>He also stated her accusations were false because in her statement she claimed he was ‘sweaty’ in a nightclub – and ‘due to an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">he was unable to sweat at the time</a>’.</p>

      <p>The Duke also came under fire for downplaying his attachment to Epstein, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/queen-elizabeth-wouldve-found-truth-prince-andrew-interview-breakfast-11189408/v">saying he ‘let the side down’</a> by staying with the convicted sex offender after his release from prison.</p>
      <p>Emily Maitlis, who conducted the interview, has since stated that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-got-queens-approval-interview-says-emily-maitlis-11173635/">Duke of York would have got permission from his mother</a> prior to filming.</p>
