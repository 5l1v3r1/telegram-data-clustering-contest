      <p>Andrew  Danylyszyn says the Lambs wanted to ‘strike while the iron is hot’ after snapping up former star Chris Lait.</p>
      <p>The flying winger has rejoined Tamworth after a stint at National North side AFC Telford.</p>
      <p>He scored 21 goals last season and was named Player of the Year by supporters and the Tamworth Herald.</p>
      <p>And Danylyszyn said: “We are over the moon to get Chris back on board at the club.</p>
      <p>“For Gaz (Smith) and I, it was about striking while the iron is hot."</p>

      <p>“In terms of where we are as a team, at the top of the table, it’s a fantastic position.</p>
      <p>“You tend to find though that teams react when they are not doing so well. That tends to be how it works.</p>
      <p>“But we want to push on and decided to strengthen from the positive position we are in.”</p>
      <p>The Lambs already have an embarrassment of riches in attack but Danylyszyn feels Lait adds to the group rather than takes away from it.</p>
      <p>“We just feels he’s a great signing,” he added. “We were really gutted to lose him and (right back) Kristian Green at the end of last season."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We understood the reasons though and to get Chris back, it’s excellent news.</p>
      <p>“He knows the system and how we play the game and he’s a very good player.</p>
      <p>“He scores goals and he has that ability to change a game at any time.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait to see him on the pitch although he knows he has to earn the right to be on the field by what his does in training.”</p>
      <p>Joint-boss Gary Smith added: "We were delighted to get Laity back.</p>
      <p>“He’s one of us, he’s back at home.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows what a top-class player he is. As a signing, I don’t think they come much bigger."</p>
