      <p>Giving a big thrust to the ‘Digital India Mission’, South Central Railway (SCR) has announced that it has become the second zone to provide free wi-fi facility to 574 stations - 367 of them with high-speed connectivity, in association with Rail Tel Corporation of India (RCIL).</p>
      <p>Free wi-fi services to rail users are provided under ‘Rail Wire’ brand and it is accessible to any user having a smartphone with working mobile connection for KYC (know your customer) considerations. To use the facility, the user has to switch on the wi-fi mode and select the Rail Wire wi-fi network.</p>
      <p>Rail Wire homepage network automatically appears on the smartphone and prompts the user to enter mobile number. The user will get one-time password (OTP) in form of SMS in the message box which has to be entered in the home page. After entering OTP, users will be able to access high-speed Internet and can start browsing.</p>
      <p>Secunderabad station was the first to provide wi-fi facility at a ‘normal speed’ in 2015 and over the last four years, it has been extended to other stations. Indian Railways had decided to upgrade and provide free high-speed wi-fi in place of normal wi-fi when nine stations including Secunderabad, Hyderabad, Kacheguda, Tirupati, Vijayawada, Guntur, Aurangabad, Warangal and Basar were connected on December 2016.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, it was extended to 37 stations, and in November to 94 stations. The facility was extended to 207 stations in March this year, and small stations too were brought into the fold. Chief public relations officer Ch. Rakesh informed that more than 50,000 users are using the service each day with an average upload of 5,000 GB and download of 28,000 GB data.</p>
      <p>“Our free wi-fi is also helping rural folk in adopting digital technology as it has happened in Gollapalli village where the teachers of the government school nearby are making use of it to educate their students,” pointed out General Manager Gajanan Mallya and appreciated his staff for completing the project within timelines set by the Railway Board.</p>
