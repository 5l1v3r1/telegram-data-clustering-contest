      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:47:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">TNN</a></address>
      <p>In the last few days, several reports have claimed that the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/CBFC">CBFC</a> asked makers of the film '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ford-v-Ferrari">Ford v Ferrari</a>', starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Christian-Bale">Christian Bale</a> and Matt Damon, to blur out alcohol bottles and glasses shown in the film. Now, the film certification board has clarified that these reports are not true.</p>
      <p>In a statement, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Prasoon-Joshi">Prasoon Joshi</a>, Chairperson, CBFC, said, "This is to clarify once and for all that CBFC never asked the makers of Ford v Ferrari to blur any shots in the film. I am disappointed with those who propagated this false news. It reflects, sadly, on such motivated people who make attempts to circulate news without verifying it."</p>
      <p>The statement further added that the blurring "was done voluntariarily by the makers."</p>
      <p>"To mindlessly assume, comment and attempt to drag into controversy without any substantiation is disappointing and uncalled for. Especially so when CBFC, as a reponsible organisation, over the last years has worked sincerely to ensure that a fine and fair balance is maintained. Itâ€™s a waste of official time and resources to counter useless controversies time and again," the statement said.</p>
      <p>Through the clarification, an irked Prasoon hoped that "the discerning people / audience would see through the motivated attempts to drag CBFC into manufactured controversies."</p>
