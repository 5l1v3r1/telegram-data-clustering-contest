Night Shyamalan’s creepy psychological thriller “Servant” will launch on its Apple TV+ streaming service on November 28 (Thanksgiving Day in the United States), with subsequent installments set to air every Friday.</p>
      <p>The company premiered “Servant” yesterday at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House in Brooklyn, New York ahead of its streaming launch. This <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/30/shyamalan-servant-apple-tv-plus-tease/">M.

      <p>The show is about a couple who after losing their newborn child adopt a real-looking fake baby doll as a surrogate baby and hire a young nanny to look after it, and that’s when the weirdness begins.</p>
      <p>From Apple’s description:</p>
      <blockquote>Doubt what you believe. From M. Night Shyamalan, Servant follows a Philadelphia couple in mourning after an unspeakable tragedy creates a rift in their marriage and opens the door for a mysterious force to enter their home.</blockquote>
