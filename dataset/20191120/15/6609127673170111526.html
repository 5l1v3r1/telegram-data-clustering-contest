      <p>The 55-year-old initially chased after a man before realising he was with another individual.</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch told jurors how her son would “stand up for himself” - but was not aware if he had a “lot of enemies”.</p>
      <p>She was giving evidence at the trial of David Callaghan,30, and Craig Corrall, 39, at the High Court in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The pair deny murdering 30-year-old Mr Hassan.</p>
      <p>The court heard how the dad would often work in his mum's pub, where she was the licensee.</p>
      <p>Mr Hassan had gone there on November 7 last year, the day of the alleged murder.</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch told the court: “He came in and said: 'I am exhausted. I am just going to go and get a shower'. He got the keys for the house. He said he was very tired and was going home.”</p>

      <p>She said her son left and she later heard “a bang”.</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch ran from behind the bar and spotted Mr Hassan against the pub door.</p>
      <p>She added: “I thought he was doing something funny then I could hear thumping and realised something was wrong.”</p>
      <p>As the mum ran out, Mr Hassan was on the ground. Miss Lynch told the court she then grabbed hold of another man there to “try and stop what was happening”.</p>
      <p>She said the man then broke free, but she initially went after him.</p>
      <p>She told prosecutor Lynsey MacDonald: “I just thought: “Who are you...what have you done?'.”</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch told the court she believed the man was armed. She said he then shouted on another person nearby who also appeared to have a weapon.</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch said she was told at one stage: “F*** off, missus.”</p>
      <p>The mum then recalled: “I ran back to the pub. He was just lying there, covered in blood. I was trying to get a phone to call an ambulance. I was just trying to help him.”</p>
      <p>Paramedics arrived to treat Mr Hassan and took him to hospital, but he later died.</p>

      <p>The court heard Miss Lynch later identified two individuals she believed were involved.</p>
      <p>Callaghan's QC Brian McConnachie quizzed Miss Lynch on the men she claimed to have seen.</p>
      <p>He asked did she shout 'I know who you are' as the mum went after them that night.</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch: “I said 'I know who you are', but I did not have a clue who they were. I only said that to frighten them.”</p>
      <p>Mr McConnachie also asked the witness about two brothers who lived in the area.</p>
      <p>The QC said: “Are they people who Owen had issues with?”</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch replied: “Don't think so.”</p>
      <p>The advocate suggested Mr Hassan was a person who had a “lot of enemies”.</p>
      <p>His mum replied: “Maybe he had enemies. I don't know.”</p>
      <p>She also stated during evidence: “Owen stood up for himself, but that does not give them reason for what they had done.”</p>
      <p>Mr McConnacie said after the death people were putting forward “a number of names” for apparently being involved.</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch said: “We were all thinking who could have done it, but I was not interested in suggestions.”</p>
      <p>The QC added photos of individuals had been sent to the mum – including of Callaghan.</p>
      <p>Mr McConnachie said: “Before the identification parade, David Callaghan was given to you as one of the names?”</p>
      <p>She replied: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Mr McConnachie said: “His photo had been sent to you?”</p>
      <p>Miss Lynch: “Yes, but it was like a different guy. The photo was completely different to the person I picked out at the identification parade.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim Mr Hassan was chased, seized by the body and repeatedly struck with knives or machetes.</p>
      <p>The trial before Lord Woolman continues.</p>
