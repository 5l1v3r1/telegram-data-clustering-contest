            <b>WI-W Vs IN-W Dream11, Probable Playing 11, Pitch Report And Match Report: India look to finish the series with aplomb and bombard their way to a sweep come today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>West Indies will be filled with solace that this is the last time they’ll be playing India with the home side waiting ardently to see the back of a side which has only dominated them but gone onto dismantle and decimate them as well. West Indies have been systematically destroyed by India with the Asian giants not only ripping into them but completely tearing them apart to hold a 4-0 lead coming into today’s culminating T20 encounter.</p>
          <p>Completely flummoxed infront of India, West Indies’ predicament was furthered the last time around as they failed to chase down the 51 runs Indi had dished out infront of them in a 9 over encounter. With rain persistently marring the encounter, West Indies failed to capitalise on their incredible bowling performance and advantage they had garnered from winning the toss as their batting unit once again catapulted to see India curb their run chase to 45.</p>

                <p>With the Indian spinners having West Indies in a stronghold all across the series, today’s encounter looks to be one which will resonate the same electric performance from the Indians. Although the visitors are bound to heavily play around with their playing 11 with there being little consequences from this encounter, the home side have been little else than pushovers with this one all set to be a foregone conclusion.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>All the matches contested on this surface have made one thing abundantly clear. This is a surface which is a travesty for the batters with their being nothing in it for them to come out play their shots. The ball stops, grips, stays low and turns sharply and squarely to make batting an aberration and with the track only bound to unravel as we run down the course, the them winning the toss is set to come out and bat first today.</p>

                            <h3>WI-W Vs IN-W Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>She’s been our pick in the wicket-keeping docket all across the length of the series and Shemaine Campbelle will continue to hold her place in our Dream 11 side for this one as well. The player has looked one of the more articulate bats from the side, someone whose nous of strokeplay should see her get some good runs today.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W Vs IN-W Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>With Smriti Mandhana given a rest in the bygone contest, the likelihood of India once again shuffling their batting order is all too likely, making selection the names off their docket a dicey proposition. We’ll be opting with the safe pick in this segment of our side by bringing in Jemimah Rodrigues first with the player bound to come out and open for the side today.</p>
                            <p>We have decided to opt for Shafali Verma as well with the young player set to retain her place in the outfit and get yet another outing to impress while from West Indies we are opting for opener Chedean Nation.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W Vs IN-W Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>She will find company in the identity of her captain and counterpart Hayley Matthews, someone who has undoubtedly been West Indies best performer this series. Her 3-13 with the ball the last time around saw her snare wickets at regular intervals along with coming out and getting a handy 11 with the bat as well, a performance which episodes why she’s revered as an all-rounder.</p>
                            <p>From India elsewhere we begin with ther captain Harmanpreet Kaur and Harleen Deol with Deepti Sharma coming in as well. West Indies have dwindled and completely fallen apart infront of Deepti with her wicket to wicket spin leaving them in tatters and we envision her routing the opposition today as well.</p>
                            <h3>WI-W Vs IN-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>The 1-8 for Radha Yadav makes her our first pick from the Indian cauldron for the day, someone who is bound to cause qualms in their batting unit and quell their efforts of scoring runs on a wicket which is made for her kind of bowling. Mansi Joshi was given a chance in the previous contest and should once again feature for the side today as well to see us get her in a swell while from the other side, the 2-2 from Ay Fletcher in the same match make her an instant choice.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Deepti continues to retain her place as our side’s captain while her spin partner Radha being selected as the vice-captain.</p>
