      <p>A top <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> ally has explosively claimed there is a quid pro-quo indicated the president allegedly abused his the power of his office.</p>
      <p>US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland told impeachment hearings Wednesday: ‘Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified previously, the answer is yes’</p>
      <p>Sondland alleges that the quid pro quo was a coveted invite to the White House issued to new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – as well as nearly $400 million in military aid that withheld from Ukraine, which is the center of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>According to Sondland, the contentious quid pro quo statement, which essentially means ‘a favor for a favor,’ regarding the White House invitation was made by Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. He also claims US officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, reportedly prepared a statement for Zelensky to read that announced two investigations that Trump wanted Ukraine to conduct.</p>

      <p>Sondland told the hearing: ‘This is critical.’</p>
      <p>‘Mike (Pompeo) – (US envoy to Ukraine )Kurt Volker and I negotiated a statement from Ze(lensky) to be delivered for our review in a day or two.</p>

      <p>‘The contents will hopefully make the boss  ​– the boss being the president – happy enough to authorize an invitation (to the White House)</p>
      <p>Ambassador Sondland told the House Intelligence Committee that the invitation had been issued in return for a probe into Trump rival Joe Biden’s son Hunter, regarding his involvement with the Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma.</p>
      <p>Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who became well-known following the 9/11 attacks, also wanted Ukraine to conduct a probe into the debunked conspiracy that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Sondland told the hearing that everything Giuliani asked for was on behalf of the president.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that Trump forced him, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, and Volker to work with Giuliani, which they did not want to do.</p>

      <p>‘We did not want to work wit Mr Giuliani. Simply put, we played the hand we were dealt. We all understood that if we refused to work with Mr. Giuliani, we would lose an important opportunity to cement relations between the United States and Ukraine. So we followed the President’s orders’</p>
      <p>Sondland said he was ‘adamantly opposed’ to the decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine, which he said was necessary for Ukraine to defend themselves from Russian aggression.</p>

      <p>‘T<span dir="auto">his security aid was critical to Ukraine’s defense and should not have been delayed,’ he said, adding that he never heard from Trump that the release of the aid was conditional on Ukraine’s announcement of the investigations. </span></p>
      <p>Sondland, who previously said he never spoke with the president about his phone call with Zelensky, was grilled about his text messages to the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, that emerged early in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>In those texts, Sondland told Taylor there was ‘no quid pro quo’  after speaking to Trump about his phone call with Zelensky, despite previously claiming he never spoke to the president about the call.</p>

      <p>When asked about his communication with Taylor, Sondland said: ‘I don’t recall president Trump every talking about me any security assistance, ever.’</p>
      <p>‘What this tells me, refreshing my memory, by the 8th of September it was abundantly clear to everyone that there was a link and that we were discussing the chicken-and-egg issue of should the Ukrainians go out on a ledge and make the statement President Trump wanted them to make.’</p>

      <p>‘And (if) then they still don’t get their White House visit and their aid. That would be really bad for our credibility.’</p>
      <p>The aid was later released on September 11.</p>
      <p>Sondland said he never was given a ‘credible explanation’ for why the aid was withheld, adding: ‘But my goal, at the time, was to do what was necessary to get the aid released, to break the logjam.’</p>
      <p>‘I really regret that the Ukrainians were placed in that predicament, but I do not regret doing what I could to try to break the logjam and to solve the problem,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Trump denies any wrongdoing, and has blasted the hearing as a ‘witch hunt’ against him.</p>
