      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Lizzo">Lizzo</a>, the charismatic pop and R&amp;B star, has been nominated for eight prizes at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, leading a class dominated by fresh faces like <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Billie+Eilish">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Lil+Nas+X">Lil Nas X</a>. Lizzo spent much of the last decade as a struggling rapper and singer but broke through this year with hits like Juice and Truth Hurts, and a bold, body-positive persona.</p>
      <p>Little known to mainstream audiences a year ago, she is now up for every major award at the Grammys, including album of the year, for the deluxe version of Cuz I Love You, record and song of the year, for Truth Hurts, and best new artist.</p>
      <p>Not so long ago the Grammys were routinely criticised for rewarding journeyman stars and rock elders at the expense of pop’s younger and more vital ranks. No longer. Continuing a trend that has been building for several years, the latest crop of nominees for the Recording Academy’s awards are young, diverse and largely reflective of the forefront of pop.</p>

      <p>Lizzo’s competition includes two artists with six nominations each: Billie Eilish, the 17-year-old alternative auteur who has built a wildly devoted following, and Lil Nas X, the 20-year-old rapper and master of internet memes whose “country-trap” hybrid Old Town Road became a cultural phenomenon this year.</p>
      <p>Among this year’s other top nominees, Ariana Grande received five nods, including record of the year, for 7 Rings, and album of the year, for Thank U, Next. The young R&amp;B singer HER, who took home two awards at the most recent Grammys, is also up for five, including album of the year, for I Used to Know Her, and record and song of the year, for Hard Place. (Record of the year is for performers and producers, while the song category recognises songwriters.)</p>
      <p>In a conspicuous rebuffing of a major star, Taylor Swift – a 10-time winner and one-time darling of the academy – received three nods, but only one in a major category: Lover, the title track of her latest album, is up for song of the year. Swift’s song You Need to Calm Down is up for best pop solo performance, and Lover for best pop vocal album.</p>
      <p>The awards ceremony will be held on January 26th in Los Angeles.</p>
