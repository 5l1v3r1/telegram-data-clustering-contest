      <p>(NAPPANEE, Ind.) — Northern Indiana police say two young children were killed when they were run over by a tractor-trailer hauling corn on a farm.</p>
      <p>The Kosciusko County Sheriff’s Office says the children, ages 3 and 5, died Tuesday afternoon on a farm near Nappanee. Both were pronounced dead at the scene about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of South Bend.</p>
      <p>Police say a preliminary investigation indicates a 26-year-old Nappanee man who was driving the tractor-trailer began pulling it forward, unaware that the children were beneath the trailer. Both suffered fatal injuries. Authorities haven’t released the youngsters’ names.</p>
      <p>WSBT-TV <a href="https://wsbt.com/news/local/two-children-dead-after-kosciusko-county-farming-accident">reports</a> that relatives say the children lived at a home on the farm property, but no one noticed they had left that home’s fenced-in yard and were near the truck.</p>
