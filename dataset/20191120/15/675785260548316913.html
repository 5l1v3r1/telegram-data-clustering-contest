      <p>Toni named the koala Lewis, after one of her seven grandchildren.</p>
      <p>The 14-year-old koala suffered serious burns as hospital staff said its health 'hangs in the balance'.</p>

      <p>The devastating fire has claimed one-third of koala population in the Port Macquarie region, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The hospital is also taking care of four other koalas that were injured in the bushfire.</p>
      <p>They have set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/saving-australian-koalas">fundraising page</a> to call for animal lovers to help rebuild the koalas' habitat.</p>
