      <h1>Activision Blizzard's CEO Doesn't Think Its Games Should Be Political</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:44:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:44</time> by <a rel="author">Ethan Gach</a></address>
      <p>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick doesn’t think his companies’ games should be used as platforms for sharing political views. He said as much an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/cnbc-transcript-cnbcs-becky-quick-interviews-activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-from-the-cnbc-evolve-conference-in-los-angeles-today.html">interview appearance on CNBC yesterday</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re not the operator of the world’s town halls,” Kotick, who in 2017 made <a href="https://kotaku.com/activisions-ceo-made-28-6-million-last-year-300-times-1825715966">28.6 million dollars running the video game company</a> behind <i>Call of Duty</i> and <i>Diablo</i>, told CNBC anchor Becky Quick. “We’re the operator of the communities that allow you to have fun through the lens of a video game.”</p>
      <p>Quick had asked Kotick how he’s grown in recent years as a CEO during a time when the public increasingly seems to look to the heads of companies like Apple and Facebook for leadership.</p>
      <p>“My responsibility is to make sure that our communities feel safe, secure, comfortable and satisfied and entertained,” he said. “And so I don’t—I don’t—that doesn’t convey to me the right to have a platform for a lot of political views, I don’t think. I think my responsibility is to satisfy our audiences and our stakeholders, our employees, our shareholders.”</p>
      <p>At the same time, Kotick said he is inspired by CEOs who do show leadership in these areas.</p>
      <p>“I think there are some business people who are incredible examples of character and integrity and principle and have what you see are the great attributes of leadership, and I think that they are incredibly inspiring for me,” he said. “But I think, you know, they do have the right to articulate views and visions and voices about government and policy and politics, and I love engaging with those people.”</p>
      <p>Apparently he is not one of them.</p>
      <p>Last month, Blizzard <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-suspends-hearthstone-player-for-hong-kong-supp-1838864961">suspended <i>Hearthstone</i> pro Ng “Blitzchung” Wai</a> and denied him prize winnings for saying “liberate Hong Kong” during a post-match interview. While the company ended up giving back the money and <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-moved-too-quickly-blizzard-president-apologizes-for-1839540746">apologizing for moving “too quickly”</a> in punishing Blitzchung, his suspension, since reduced, will still be in effect for six months.</p>
