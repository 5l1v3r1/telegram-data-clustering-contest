      <p>Apparently there’s a pretty major security vulnerability in Android’s code that would allow a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343668-camscanner-the-latest-infected-app-banned-from-the-play-store/">rogue app</a> to hijack the camera and microphone of a device and record in the background. Despite Android’s robust permission system, this flaw works around those permissions, and it affects way more devices than you’d think.</p>
      <p>So even if you haven’t given a shiny new app permission to use your camera or microphone, it could quietly turn on and begin recording you or the things around you. The good news is that it can’t do anything with those files by default, but the bad news is that it’s not tricky to upload it onto a cloud server somewhere by simply asking for storage permissions, which is incredibly common for apps to do anyway. That’s a pretty big thing to overlook.</p>
      <p>If you want to compound on things further, apps could also theoretically track targets by reading the GPS data of photographs and videos. Yikes.</p>
      <p>According to Checkmarx, the security firm that found this vulnerability, Google has already patched up their <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346068-google-pixel-no-more-updates/">Pixel devices</a> with a camera update back in July. Samsung has also taken care of their phones, although it’s not clear when that actually happened. Otherwise, though, there’s a potential for a ton of other unpatched devices to be affected by this. Those models and makers weren’t disclosed, but if it’s everyone besides Google and Samsung, that’s a very long list.</p>
      <p>If you want to check and see if your phone is vulnerable, there are some ADB commands you can run to try and force the exploit to happen on your own. It’s a little complicated, but it might be worth the peace of mind.</p>
