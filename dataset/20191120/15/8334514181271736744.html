      <p>Outfielder Gerardo Parra agreed to a contract with the Yomiuri Giants, the Japanese professional baseball team announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Parra, whose popularity increased after using “Baby Shark” as his walk-up song, batted .250 with eight homers and 42 RBIs in 89 games last season for the Washington Nationals. The 32-year-old spent his first 30 games of the campaign with the San Francisco Giants.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post said the deal is for $2 million in 2020 plus a $500,000 bonus. The contract includes a vesting option for 2021 worth $3 million.</p>
      <p>While mired in a slump, Parra chose the catchy children’s song after seeing his 2-year-old daughter dance to it. The tune later became an anthem for the Nationals as they rallied from a 19-31 start to win the first World Series title in franchise history.</p>
      <p>“What he’s done in that clubhouse has really changed the way these guys go about their business. I mean, it was business. There wasn’t a whole lot of — he made it fun for this team,” Nationals manager Dave Martinez said to NBC Sports Washington in October.</p>
      <p>“Those guys up there, every one of his teammates love him, love him. All the fans love him. He’s just that guy. He’s the Parra Shark.”</p>
      <p>Parra, 32, batted .276 with 88 homers and 522 RBIs over 11 seasons with the Arizona Diamondbacks (2009-14), Milwaukee Brewers (2014-15), Baltimore Orioles (2015), Colorado Rockies (2016-18), Giants (2019) and Nationals (2019).</p>
