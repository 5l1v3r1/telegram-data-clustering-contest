      <p>If you been scrolling through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/echowhatson/">Facebook</a> then no doubt heart-warming family cartoon <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> scenes have been popping up in your feed.</p>
      <p>This is the latest festive fad on social media which allows you to turn your <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-family">family</a> into a cartoon complete with a log burning fireplace and decked out Christmas tree in the background.</p>
      <p>The clever idea actually comes from a website offering personalised <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/buy-excitable-edgar-john-lewis-17251981">gifts</a> including home decor, jewellery, photo socks and even underwear, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/how-make-facebook-cartoon-family-17286080">MEN reports</a>.</p>
      <p>There's also an option to create your own personalised Christmas digital image which can then be printed on to mugs.</p>
