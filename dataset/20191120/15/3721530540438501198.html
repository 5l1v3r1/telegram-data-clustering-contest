      <p>The first season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20965516/fortnite-battle-royale-most-important-game-2010s"><i>Fortnite</i></a> Chapter 2 will be extended into 2020, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">developer Epic Games announced today</a>.</p>
      <p>The reason? To account for a whole slew of holiday content that’ll roll out over the new few months. Over the holiday season, Epic said it will unveil “new game features,” new rewards, and “a live experience that you won’t want to miss.” Here’s the full statement:</p>
      <blockquote>With a new year comes new beginnings! Last year we celebrated 14 Days of Fortnite over the holidays. This year we’ve got even more content for you to unwrap, including new game features, free rewards and a live experience that you won’t want to miss. To prepare for all the new holiday-themed updates, we will be extending Chapter 2’s first season into early February. Get ready for winter!</blockquote>

      <p>Last year with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/1/6/18171099/14-days-of-fortnite-end-date-extension-return">14 Days of <i>Fortnite</i></a>, the game’s map got a winter makeover, with each of the 14 days bringing “new and returning LTMs.” Holiday outfits were updated in the Item Shop daily, along with a “festive Battle Bus,” a “Snowball Launcher,” and <i>Fortnite</i>’s “holiday-lit Legendary Bush” in-game. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/8/17095428/fortnite-br-battle-royale-patch-3-2-epic-games">Celebrations continued into the start of 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>Details are slim on what this year will bring — but we can expect it to last into 2020. Chapter 2’s first season is expected to end in early February 2020.</p>
