      <p>Dilip Saikia, the Bharatiya Janata Dal MP from Magladoi Lok Sabha constituency on Wednesday advocated the central government to declare a nationwide holiday on the occasion of birth anniversary of Assam polymath Mahapurush Shrimanta Sankardeva. The MP raised the issue during the zero hour session of the Parliament.</p>
      <p>MP Dilip Saikia also demanded for setting up of a foundation to carry out programmes as well as activities preaching Shrimanta Sankardeva teachings and legacies. He stated this would further Sankardev’s ideology and spread his message of social justice to the masses not only in India but also abroad. According to the MP, the nationwide holiday on Shrimanta Sankardeva’s birthday would honour the emotions and sentiments of Assamese people and the community at large in Northeast.</p>
