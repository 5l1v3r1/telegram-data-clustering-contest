      <p>Cryptocurrency and blockchain platforms have always viewed <a href="https://apollocurrency.com/">mass adoption</a> as the holy grail of achievement. While it is true that the new industry is constantly improving its image and increasing global presence, it is still a far cry from mainstream adoption. This is especially true when it comes to actual sovereign countries and their governments legalizing and allowing the industry to grow. </p>

      <h3>Introducing all-in-one Cryptocurrency Platform Apollo</h3>
      <p>Blockchain platform <a href="https://apollocurrency.com/">Apollo</a> has recently taken an important step towards this journey of mainstreaming the sector.

      <h3>MoU with Lesotho</h3>
