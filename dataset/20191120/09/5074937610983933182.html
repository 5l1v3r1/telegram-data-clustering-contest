      <p>Accra, Nov. 20, GNA - The Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Madam Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, has arrived in the Belgium capital of Brussels to participate in a High-Level Conference to mark the 30th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).</p>
      <p>The event, which is under the theme, “Every Child has the Right to Dream”, will be held on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>There will be discussions on 'Protecting the rights of the child in an ever-changing digital world: threats and opportunities'; ' The changing nature of armed conflict and its impact on   </p>
      <p>children's rights and future' ,  'Mainstreaming of a child- rights approach in all development planning and implementation globally'; among other issues.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Minister was invited by the Chair of the European Parliament’s Sub-committee on Human Rights, Maria Arena.</p>
      <p>The Queen of the Kingdom of Belgium and Honorary President of UNICEF-Belgium, Queen Mathilde, is expected to serve as the Guest of Honour for the Brussels ceremony.</p>
      <p>Other dignitaries expected to grace the celebration are the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, and the President of the European Commission, Ursula Van der Layen.</p>
      <p>During the discussions, Madam  Ayorkor Botchwey is expected to point out Ghana’s commitment to institutionalise the Rights of the Child, which was clearly demonstrated when the country’s Legislature passed the Children’s Act into law in 1998.</p>
      <p>The Children's Act, among others, provides for the rights of the child and protects children from exploitative labour and child marriages.</p>
      <p>Ghana made history by becoming the first country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990.</p>
