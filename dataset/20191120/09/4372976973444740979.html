      <p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/challenger/">Dodge Challenger</a>. And obviously <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/">Dodge</a> wouldn't let that significant date go by without a special version of the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/01/2020-dodge-challenger-review/">2020 Dodge Challenger</a>. Meet the limited production Dodge Challenger 50th Anniversary Edition.</p>
      <p>The package is offered on the V6-powered GT with rear-wheel drive, as well as the R/T, R/T Scat Pack and <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/11/14/2020-dodge-challenger-scat-pack-widebody-review/">R/T Scat Pack Widebody</a>. The Hellcat and Hellcat Redeye are left out, but every 2020 example will get special 50th Anniversary badges to make up for that.</p>
      <p>On the outside, the package features a matte black hood, roof and trunk lid. V8 models get a body-color Shaker scoop. This marks the first time the Shaker scoop has been available on a Widebody <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/dodge/challenger/">Challenger</a>. Despite having a Shaker scoop, the special edition cars also get the air intake headlights pioneered by the Hellcat, and they have a "50" printed on them to go with the other 50th Anniversary badging. All models get 20-inch wheels. These are finished in what Dodge calls "Gold School." These Challengers can be painted in one of seven colors: Frostbite, Hellraisin, Sinamon Stick, Go Mango, TorRed, F8 Green or the all-new Gold Rush.</p>
      <p>Inside the Challenger 50th Anniversary Edition are Nappa leather and Alcantara-covered seats and "Sepia" stitching and embroidery. It's all matched by carbon fiber trim with copper threads woven into it. The instrument cluster and the air vent badge are finished in the car's exterior color.</p>
      <p>Dodge will build only 70 of each model in each color as a tribute to the original car's 1970 model year. This means that there will be 490 GTs, 490 R/Ts, 490 R/T Scat Packs and 490 R/T Scat Pack Widebody models for a grand total of 1,960 cars. Each model has a different price for the 50th Anniversary package. It costs $4,995 for the GT, $5,495 for the R/T, and $5,995 for the Scat Pack models. The cars go on sale this coming spring.</p>
