      <p>Universities in Australia are distancing themselves from the Duke of York after a ‘car crash’ interview about his involvement with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> was accused of showing a lack of empathy towards victims of the disgraced financier, who took his own life while imprisoned earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In the interview he denied sleeping with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions between 2001 and 2002, twice while she was underage.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to rebut her account of what happened the duke told the BBC’s Emily Maitlis that he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">‘can’t sweat’ due to a medical condition.</a></p>
      <p>Eyebrows were also raised when he said he distinctly remembered being at a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">Pizza Express in Woking</a> on the night of one of the alleged incidents.</p>

      <p>Multi million-pound businesses and British universities have have begun severing ties or moving away from the royal and are being followed by institutions in Australia.</p>

      <p>Bond University, the University of Wollongong (UoW) and the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) have either ended their relationship with the duke’s Pitch@Palace entrepreneurial initiative or will not be continuing it in the future.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Perth’s Murdoch University, also listed online as a partner, said it was ‘currently reviewing its support of the Pitch@Palace event in 2020’.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Bond University said: ‘We have previously said any new agreement would be considered in 2020.</p>
      <p>‘However, in light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement.’</p>

      <p>It comes after London Metropolitan University said it would consider the duke’s role as its patron, while a student panel at Huddersfield University passed a motion to lobby Andrew to resign as its chancellor.</p>
      <p>Asian-focused bank Standard Chartered has joined KPMG in deciding not to renew its sponsorship of the Pitch@Palace scheme.</p>
      <p>AstraZeneca’s three-year partnership with the initiative is due to expire at the end of the year ans is being reviewed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Outward Bound Trust, of which Andrew is a patron, is to hold a board meeting in the next few days to discuss the matter.</p>
      <p>The duke has cancelled a visit to flood-ravaged communities in South Yorkshire today and was summoned for crisis talks at Buckingham Palace, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10381186/prince-andrew-scraps-yorkshire-trip-palace-crisis-talks/">according to the Sun.</a></p>

      <p>As the scandal unravelled, former home secretary Jacqui Smith claimed prince made ‘racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable’ at a Buckingham Palace state banquet in 2007.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the palace said: ‘HRH has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the Middle East over a period of years and has many friends from the region. He does not tolerate racism in any form.’</p>
      <p>The palace has also ‘strenuously denied’ claims Prince Andrew <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-used-n-word-meeting-downing-street-advisor-11175441/">used the term ‘n****r in the woodpile’</a> during a Downing Street discussion about trade policy.</p>
