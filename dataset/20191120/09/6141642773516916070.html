      <p>The Foreign Secretary has summoned the Chinese ambassador after a former employee of the UK’s Hong Kong consulate alleged he was tortured in China.</p>
      <p>Dominic Raab asked to meet China’s UK representative, after Simon Cheng, a Hong Kong citizen who worked for the UK government for two years, was held in China for 15 days in August.</p>
      <p>Mr Cheng, 29, told the BBC he was “shackled, blindfolded, and hooded” and claims he was beaten and forced to sign confessions.</p>
      <p>He was accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong.</p>
      <blockquote>They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests - they asked what support, money, and equipment we were giving to the protesters<cite>Simon Cheng</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Mr Cheng said his captors “said they work for the secret service and that there are no human rights.</p>
      <p>“They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles… or any vulnerable part.”</p>
      <p>Mr Cheng said the Chinese authorities accused Britain of supporting demonstrations in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>He recalled: “They said I’m a state enemy and I’m a traitor, and also they asked whether the consulate instructed me to mingle with the protest.”</p>
      <p>He added: “They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests – they asked what support, money, and equipment we were giving to the protesters.</p>
      <p>“I told them I want to make it 100% clear, the UK didn’t assign resources or help with the protests.”</p>
      <p>Unrest in the city state began in the summer with calls to scrap a now-suspended extradition bill, but have now widened to protest against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing.</p>
      <blockquote>I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon, in violation of China's international obligations<cite>Dominic Raab</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Dominic Raab has said the Government was “shocked and appalled” by Mr Cheng’s treatment which he believes “amounts to torture”.</p>
      <p>He said: “Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team.</p>
      <p>“I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon, in violation of China’s international obligations.</p>
      <p>“I have made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account.”</p>
