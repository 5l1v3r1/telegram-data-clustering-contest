      <p>Yemen’s Foreign Affairs Ministry denounced Iran's recognition of Houthi militia's representative in Tehran.<br/><br/>In a statement, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry expressed its strong condemnation of Iran’s recognition of Houthi representative and considered Tehran's approach a clear violation of UN Charter, Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and Security Council's relevant resolutions on Yemen, mainly Resolution 2216.<br/><br/>The ministry held the Iranian regime accountable for the repercussions of this blatant violation, which confirmed Tehran's involvement in supporting Houthi militias and recognizing them.<br/><br/>The ministry also said Iran is accountable for not protecting the diplomatic premises and the ministry's possessions, confirming that it will take legal action against this approach. It called on the international community and the Security Council to condemn this behavior, considering it irresponsible.<br/><br/>Houthi media in Sanaa reported that the group's top commander Ibrahim Mohammed al-Dailami presented his credentials to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in his capacity as ambassador to Yemen.<br/><br/>Dailami conveyed greetings of the President of Supreme Political Council Mahdi Mashat, while Rouhani confirmed the Iranian regime's support to Houthis and the political solution in Yemen.<br/><br/>The group appointed Dailami as its ambassador to Iran a few weeks ago after spokesman Mohammad Abdul Salam Felita visited Iran and met with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.<br/><br/>During the meeting, the Houthi spokesman delivered a message from the group’s leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi to Khamenei, recognizing the Supreme Leader’s authority, and considering his rule as “an extension of the Prophet's.”<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Yemeni government accused Iran's regime of instructing Houthis to hijack the Korean tanker while sailing south of the Red Sea, according to Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani.<br/><br/>Eryani said that the kidnapping and armed robbery carried out by the militias was an unprecedented operation that threatened all efforts to bring peace to Yemen.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, South Korea confirmed that Houthi militias hijacked a boat towing a South Korean drilling rig in the Red Sea on Sunday.<br/><br/>The Minister described the operation as “terrorist” saying it revealed the extent of Houthi threat on the security and freedom of international navigation and global trade in the Red Sea and the Strait of Bab al-Mandeb.<br/><br/>The Yemeni minister indicated that this dangerous escalation, coinciding with the protests in most Iranian provinces, was apparently directed and planned by Iran to divert attention from this popular uprising and pressure the international community.<br/><br/>He urged the international community to take decisive stances regarding this maritime piracy, which he said “constitutes a serious violation of international laws.” He also called for taking measures to support the legitimate government and stop Houthi threat to international shipping lines and regional and international peace and security.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi received on Tuesday the UN's Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths, and the two discussed a range of topics and issues relating to the Yemeni crisis, peace efforts, and possible prospects.<br/><br/>President Hadi welcomed the UN's envoy, appreciating his tireless efforts to make peace and break the deadlock in the peace process, particularly regarding the Swede's Agreement about Hodiedah's seaport, city, prisoners and besiege of Taiz in light of the Houthi militia's reluctance to carry out the agreement's articles, according to Saba News Agency.<br/><br/>Hadi reiterated his interest in achieving a comprehensive peace in accordance with the three terms of reference that produces sustainable stability and security in Yemen and the region.<br/><br/>Saba noted that the UN envoy praised Hadi's efforts to establish peace including the signing of Riyadh Agreement with Transitional Council as this is a significant step to bolster the state's apparatuses, security, stability, and services.</p>
