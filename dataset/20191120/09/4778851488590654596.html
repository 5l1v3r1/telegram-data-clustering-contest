      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4972580/russia-euro-2020-expulsion-doping-scotland/">Reports</a> claim the 2018 World Cup hosts - who beat Scotland 2-1 and 4-0 during qualifying for next summer's tournament - could be banned from the competition and the country suspended from competing in the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games as well.</p>

      <p>The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) executive committee are due to meet on December 9 to discuss "alleged inconsistencies in anti-doping data" and Russia risks expulsion from major sporting events and removal as a host country.</p>
      <p>Russia's internal anti-doping agency, RUSADA, is expected to be declared "non-compliant" when WADA meets next month, with a period of time between January 2012 and August 2015 under scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Three group games and one quarter-final meeting in next summer's Euros are scheduled for the St Petersburg Stadium, but all four matches could be moved if Russia is banned from sporting events.</p>
      <p>A statement issued by WADA on Monday read: "The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) confirms that WADA's independent Compliance Review Committee (CRC) met yesterday, 17 November, to consider a report from the Agency's Intelligence and Investigations Department (I&amp;I) and independent forensic experts and, accordingly, to discuss the ongoing compliance procedure brought against the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</p>
      <p>"In line with the process, the CRC will now bring a formal recommendation to the WADA executive committee (ExCo), under the chairmanship of WADA President Sir Craig Reedie whose term of office runs until December 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>"The ExCo is scheduled to meet on 9 December to discuss the recommendation."</p>
      <p>UEFA's disciplinary regulations makes no reference to contingency plans in the event of doping and potential competition bans, with European football's governing body stating: "In so far as they are compatible with UEFA's rules, measures taken by a government body or another sporting body in relation to doping are recognised by UEFA."</p>
      <p>Thus there is no confirmation that UEFA would kick Russia out of Euro 2020 or if they did, who would replace them. Scotland finished third in Group I behind Stanislav Cherchesov's side but that is no guarantee of replacing Russia should they be banned from competing.</p>
