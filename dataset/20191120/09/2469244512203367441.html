      <h1>Lemonheigh-Evans provides Torquay United with timely injury boost</h1>
      <h2>Midfielder ahead of schedule in his return from injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:58:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">David Thomas, Stuart James</a></address>
      <p>Midfielder Connor Lemonheigh-Evans is expected to regain fitness earlier than expected, giving a timely boost to Torquay United as they try to defy a daunting injury-list and stay in the National League promotion race.</p>
      <p>Bristol City loanee Lemonheigh-Evans, one of the stars of the Gulls' NL South championship last season, has been out for more than two-and-a-half months with an ankle injury which required surgery.</p>
      <p>He was not due to return until Christmas or the New Year.</p>
      <p>But manager Gary Johnson has  that the Wales Under-21 international's recovery is ahead of schedule, and he could be back in training with United within the next two weeks.</p>
      <p>"Connor keeps in touch all the time, he is going well and he thinks he will be back playing early next month.  That's better than we thought originally," said Johnson.</p>
      <p>"He had a similar injury to his other ankle in the past, so he's using that experience in his recovery now.</p>
      <p>"He may even be back with us in two weeks' time - he might not be quite ready to play then, but he will be close."</p>
      <p>Torquay came away from their 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Maidstone United ten days ago with seven players injured - Lemonheigh-Evans, Asa Hall, Armani Little, Opi Edwards, Jake Andrews, Liam Davis and teenage defender Louie Slough.</p>
      <p>Davis' ankle fracture prompted Johnson to sign 21-year-old Reading left-back Ramarni Medford-Smith on loan until January.</p>
      <p>Midfielders Frank Vincent and Ben Whitfield limped off in last Saturday's 2-1 home league defeat by Sutton United, while United were also without loanee defender Joe Lewis, on Wales Under-21 duty, and Ryan Dickson, who is on loan at Truro City.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Swansea City loanee Lewis will be available for this Saturday's trip to bottom club Chorley, Vincent and Whitfield, - they both sustained 'kicks' against Sutton - are battling to be fit for that game and so is Andrews.</p>
      <p>Johnson stressed: "We seem to have had important players out for a long time, and I am really proud of the boys who have got us in the hunt.</p>
      <p>"We were playing that Sutton game to go top of the league, and that's what made it more disappointing for everyone.</p>
      <p>"It's very tight and competitive at the top, but we are part of that competition now.</p>
      <p>"When you look at our starting XI last Saturday, very few have any real experience at senior level.</p>
      <p>"But most of them have been winning games for us, and I think they can keep doing it."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a hat-trick by 17-year-old striker Olaf Koszela led Torquay United to a 4-0 win over Peninsula League Elmore in the Devon St Lukes Challenge Cup second round at Horsdon Park.</p>
      <p>Koszela scored in the 24th, 41st and 68th minutes, with Manny Duku chipping in with the Gulls' second goal in the 34th minute.</p>
