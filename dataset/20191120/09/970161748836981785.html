      <h1>Marie Kondo's new shop does not spark joy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:24:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/tessa-coates/" target="_blank">Tessa Coates</a></address>
      <p>Marie Kondo has finally done the tidying guru equivalent of jumping the shark this week, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/helping-get-rid-stuff-marie-kondo-now-wants-sell-homeware-collection-11180539/">officially launched an online store</a>.</p>
      <p>It was an inevitable step perhaps for this folding behemoth, after a best-selling book and a hit <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> special. Where to go next except swiftly into selling merch?</p>
      <p>The irony has not been lost on the world that our foremost advocate on getting rid of clutter is now selling us clutter. And we feel a little – I don’t know, betrayed?</p>
      <p>Because Marie promised us we were alright just as we are, except now here’s a shop to make us just that little bit better. Without anyone noticing she’s played the ultimate long Kon, and transitioned from quietly teaching us to fold T-shirts to running a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/29/well-never-achieve-true-wellness-if-were-all-hungry-to-get-the-job-done-10082343/">Goop</a>-style e-commerce empire.</p>
      <p>An astonishing array of treasures are for sale. A crumb brush for £20. A very satisfying looking serving bowl that looks like a giant thumb made it out of blue tack (a breezy £170). A ceramic set of nesting trays (£100 for the full set).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>They’re all very elegant and of course, minimalistic. Perhaps they’re designed to look beautiful sat all alone because once you’ve bought one thing you can’t afford to buy anything else.</p>
      <p>In a remarkable display of cognitive dissonance, there is also a tote bag for sale for £33. THIRTY. THREE. POUNDS. For a tote bag. As if we don’t all have 800 tote bags in the house already. In the cupboard. Under the sink. Under the bed.</p>
      <p>We couldn’t throw them away because they ‘might be useful’ and now Marie is trying to sell us another one for THIRTY THREE POUNDS. (Yes it’s dark blue and it’s specially for wrapping cut flowers and I’m considering buying it, but that’s not the point).</p>
      <p>When Marie’s book first came out, it was revolutionary and ground-breaking in the simplicity of its approach.</p>
      <p>It was very clear that you didn’t need any of the extra stuff. No fancy boxes or storage techniques. </p>
      <blockquote>If you’re already a folding, thanking, fully signed up member of the Marie Kondo fan club, you already own everything in this store.</blockquote>
      <p>You didn’t need any more of the ‘24 life hacks to transform your kitchen’ articles. No pyramid schemes, no courses to go on, no extra things to buy.</p>
      <p>You only needed to reset your approach to the things you owned – it was all about the within. Just you and a book whispering ‘thank you’ to an old jumper and then letting it go. Now suddenly you can spend literally thousands of pounds on sparking joy with these specially chosen items.  </p>

      <p>But here’s the thing: if you’re already a folding, thanking, fully signed up member of the Marie Kondo fan club, you already own everything in this store. She’s preaching to the choir.</p>
      <p>We’ve already got the empty mason jars and the trays and the storage boxes. We got in this mess because we kept believing that this jar or this bowl or this crystal tuning fork was going to fix everything.</p>
      <p>She may have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/19/marie-kondo-sparks-consternation-with-online-homeware-store">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that if our bowl already sparks joy then we shouldn’t replace it, but that doesn’t matter. We’ve seen what she thinks is a joyful bowl now and we can’t go back.</p>
      <p>What Marie is really selling here is ‘new notebook promise’. That start of term fresh new notebook feeling – all promise and potential.</p>
      <p>The dream that you too are only a burnished brass ladle, hand-loomed wooden tea container or glass jar away from finally reaching your true potential.</p>
      <p>Marie used to be our faithful guide through the life changing magic of tidying. This tiny and unassuming woman who taught us that you only needed to find joy in the things you already had, let go of what was not serving you, and crucially stop believing in quick fixes. </p>
      <p>Now it turns out at the end of the experience you can also visit the gift shop.</p>
      <p>That was never the spirit of the KonMari method. This eye-wateringly expensive online store is selling exactly the sort of quick fixes she once rallied against, albeit beautifully handcrafted limited edition quick fixes.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The world is full of people trying to sell you things to fill the void. Marie was the shining light saying ‘love that old weird frog pencil topper? Put him on display!’ Now it’s all ‘this £200 brass plated utensil holder is your only path to joy’.</p>
      <p>From the state of the online backlash it would seem that this is an about-turn from Marie Kondo that won’t be tolerated. But then, the ceramic organising tray is already sold out online, so maybe we’re just as stupid as we look.</p>
      <p>Now if you’ll excuse me I have crumb brush to buy.</p>
