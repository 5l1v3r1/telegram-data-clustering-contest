      <h1>Bangladesh wary of early sunset: Daniel Vettori</h1>

      <p>KOLKATA: Bangladesh's spin bowling consultant <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Daniel-Vettori">Daniel Vettori</a> conceded that early sunset in Kolkata could pose a massive challenge for his team's batsmen during the "twilight" hours of the upcoming historic Day/Night Test against India starting on Friday.</p>
      <p>While a handful of first team players from India have played pink-ball game in domestic cricket, Bangladesh's only experience with the pink ball was a one-off Day/Night four-day match in 2013 but none of the current team players were part of that fixture.</p>
      <p>"I think the pink ball is relatively normal in the day, the challenge will be how much of the Test is played under lights. Obviously, the sun sets quite early here. I think 4:30 pm. That will be the time we will see the pink ball come into play," the former New Zealand captain said.</p>
      <p>Vettori has not been a part of any Day/Night Test venture but from the experience he feels batting during twilight period will be challenging.</p>
      <p>"My experience is only from watching on TV and it seems to do a little bit more during twilight dusk. So I think that's going to be a big sighting period of the Test match. That'll be the period of the Test the teams will try to do technically a few different things. I think that the final one and a half session would be very interesting."</p>
      <p>With the pink ball expected to help seamers more, Indian captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> is expecting complete his 12th straight home series win with ease.</p>
      <p>Vettori however said Bangladesh pacers are equally excited with the team boasting left-arm pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mustafizur-rahman">Mustafizur Rahman</a> who sat out in Indore.</p>
      <p>"All fast bowlers are really excited. Coming to grips with the balls, I think the SG pink ball is slightly a bit different. Most guys have limited experience of Kookaburra ones. I think there's a lot of excitement and optimism around."</p>
