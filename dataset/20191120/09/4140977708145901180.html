            <b>BAR Vs JAM Dream11 : Table toppers Barbados look to continue their dominant ways when they take on Jamaica today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Placed in the pinnacles of Group A in the showpiece Super50 Cup, Barbados have undoubtedly been the most sublime, pristine, succulent and well rounded outfit of all the sides in the group. Their five wins from six matches see them well clear of second and third place by eight points, a position the side will be looking to consolidate come today.</p>
          <p>Ever since losing their tournament opener, the side have been on a five match winning spree, dominating and decimating their opponents to continue in their ascendancy. The side coming into today’s impending clash having thumped Combined Colleges and Campuses by four wickets, prevailing and persevering in a low scoring encounter, a win which was a testament to their enigmatic and euphoria filed brand of cricket.</p>

                <p>Needing208 to win, the side ended up winning with four overs to spare on a  wicket akin to today’s surface, a display they’ll be looking to reverberate come today as well. In Jamaica, they are taking on a side who themselves come into this forthcoming tie with three wins in succession to take them into third place.</p>
                <p>The side are entering the fray of this upcoming contest having defeated Canada by four wickets as they chased down the 244 run target in 47.5 overs. With both the sides coming into this contest in impeccable and immaculate form, both the sides will be looking to leave no stone unturned and spare no expense in a bid to continue galloping up the points tally and with it nail down a spot into the ensuing round.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A sluggish, devoid of much assistance for the batters and crumbling wicket, this is a surface where the bats are going to struggle to hit runs. The ball grips, stops and turns before lying on squarely onto the bat, making strokeplay an extremely tepid and tentative proposition, one which should see us be in for a low scoring contest.</p>
                      <p>With the wicket bound to be only left in only more tatters as we scrimmage our way through the outing, the team winning the toss is all set to come out and bat first today.</p>
