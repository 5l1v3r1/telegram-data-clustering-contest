      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/eurjpy">EUR/JPY</a></b> is seeing a decent bounce from the 55 day ma, this is located at 119.47 currently. Rallies should find tougher <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> at 121.34/80. This is the location of the 200 day ma, the 50% Fibonacci retracement and the late July high. Currently the intraday <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/elliott-wave">Elliott wave</a> counts are suggesting scope to retest this resistance, but if seen, it should again hold the topside”.</p>
      <p>“While capped here, attention remains on the 118.72 uptrend. This should hold the initial test, however longer term the risk has increased for a break lower. Failure here will target the 117.09 October low ahead of the 115.87 September low”.</p>
