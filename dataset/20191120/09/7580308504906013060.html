      <p><a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones</a> star <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/emilia-clarke/">Emilia Clarke</a> has revealed that she has been pressured to acting nude scenes following her role as dragon queen Daenerys Targaryen in the HBO Emmy winning series.</p>
      <p>The English actress revealed this in a conversation with American podcast host Dax Shepard on his podcast Armchair Expert. <i>“Season One was what it was… There was a f__k-ton of nudity,”</i> she said about the multiple nudes scenes she performed in the first season of the series.</p>
      <blockquote><i>“I’m a lot savvier with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing,”</i> Clarke said.<br/><br/><i>“I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, ‘No, the sheet stays up,’ and they’re like, ‘You don’t wanna disappoint your ‘Game of Thrones’ fans.’ And I’m like, ‘F–you.’ I feel like I’ve seen enough now to know what is actually needed.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>Clarke, who was 23 when Game of Thrones started filming in July of 2010 explained how she first felt after receiving the role and learning how much nudity was expected of her.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I’d come fresh from drama school, and I was like, ‘Approach this as a job.’ If it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed, this is what this is and I’m gonna make sense of it,” Clarke said. <br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“I’m floating through this first season and I have no idea what I’m doing, I have no idea what any of this is. I’ve never been on a film set like this before, I’d been on a film set twice before then, and I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do and I don’t know what’s expected of me.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Clarke recalled filming intimate scenes on the set, revealing that she found nude scenes “terrifying.” She explained how former co-star Jason Momoa who acted as Khal Drogo mentored during the filming of Season 1.</p>
      <blockquote><i>“It’s only now that I realize how fortunate I was with that, because that could have gone many, many, many different ways. Because Jason had experience, he had done a bunch of stuff before coming on to this, he was like, ‘Sweetie, this is how it’s meant to be and this is how it’s not meant to be, and I’m going to make sure that’s the way it goes,’”</i> Clarke said, adding that Momoa would always be sure she received a robe during the filming of nude scenes.<br/><br/><i>“He was so kind and considerate and cared about me as a human being. He took care of me, he really did. In an environment where I didn’t know I needed to be taken care of.”</i></blockquote>
