        <b>- Nigerian singer, Davido Adeleke, has received worthy recognition from perhaps one of his biggest fans</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The singer’s manager, Asa Asika, recently took to social media to celebrate Davido’s work ethic</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- According to Asika, Davido is the hardest worker in the game</b>
      </p>
      <p>Son of Nigerian billionaire and talented musician, David Adeleke, popularly called Davido, is no doubt a young man many have described as hardworking.</p>
      <p>Despite being from a home where he can decide not to lift a finger to work, Davido has been known to sweat it out in the entertainment industry with other top shots as he continues to remain relevant.</p>
      <p>Just recently, Davido received a shout out on social media from perhaps one of his biggest fans, his manager. Asa Asika had posted a photo of the singer on his Instastory as he hailed him.</p>

      <p>According to Asika, Davido is one of the hardest workers in the game. See a screenshot of his post below:</p>

      <p>Lovely.</p>
      <p>Just recently, Davido made the news after he took all his squad members designer shopping in Dubai.</p>
      <p>Obviously touched by the gesture, another singer who was also a recipient of the goodwill, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275771-zlatan-ibile-davido-buying-gifts-all.html">Zlatan Ibile, took to his Instagram page to praise Davido.</a></p>
      <p>Zlatan who was clearly overwhelmed with emotions shared a photo of them with their shopping bags at what appeared to be the designer store. He captioned the photo: <i>"BaBa Ifeanyi, you no go kill us @davidoofficial thanks my G".</i></p>
      <p>Earlier on, <b>Legit.ng</b> reported the news of how <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275175-davido-gifts-zlatan-ibile-40-karat-necklace-recounts-helped-famous.html">Davido also gifted Zlatan, a 40K necklace</a> from the ones on his neck. Davido shared the video of the touching moment on his Instagram page as he explained the reason behind his action.</p>
