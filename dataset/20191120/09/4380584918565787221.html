      <p>Veteran outfielder Gerardo Parra has found a new home in the Land of the Rising Sun, after agreeing to a deal with the Yomiuri Giants of Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball, the Giants announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Parra, 32, became a fan favorite during the Nationals' run to the 2019 World Series championship with his charismatic personality and "Baby Shark" walk-up song. He hit .250 with eight homers and 42 RBIs in 89 games and appeared in seven postseason contests with Washington after being acquired in May when San Francisco designated him for assignment. Parra’s clubhouse presence helped ignite the Nationals -- they were 15-22 when he made his club debut and went 78-47 the rest of the way, rolling through the postseason to their first World Series title.</p>

      <p>The Venezuelan native compiled a .276 average with 88 homers and 522 RBIs over 11 seasons in the Majors with the D-backs, Brewers, Orioles, Rockies, Giants and Nationals after making his big league debut with Arizona in 2009.</p>
