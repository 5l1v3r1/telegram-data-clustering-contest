        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has stated that he ‘does not like to keep players who don’t want to stay at the club,’ as he takes charge at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho was announced as the new Spurs manager on Wednesday morning and takes over a squad with some players showing signs of unrest.</p>
      <p>Christian Eriksen, who is out of contract in the summer, has started just seven of Tottenham’s 12 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> games this season, despite being an integral part of the team since arriving in 2013.</p>
      <p>The Dane admitted that he was interested in a new challenge over the summer but no transfer emerged and his form has suffered since.</p>
      <p>Also out of contract at the end of the season, centre-backs Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld have been out of the team at points this season, with their futures unclear.</p>

      <p>Mourinho was asked about the situation at Spurs last month and made it clear that if he has a player that sees his future elsewhere, then it is time to let them go.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t like to keep players who don’t want to stay at the club. I’m not even thinking of the economical perspective, but the emotion of the player,’ Mourinho told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11845014/tottenham-verdict-jose-mourinho-gary-neville-and-more-assess-spurs-situation">Sky Sports.</a></p>
      <p>‘We loved [Arjen] Robben and wanted to keep him [at Chelsea], but he wanted to join Real Madrid, so there are some moments when motivation affects the performance and it’s very difficult to keep a player really happy when he has other thoughts.’</p>

      <p>The former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss did praise Spurs for keeping their squad together over the summer, though, describing them as a ‘fantastic group.’</p>
      <p>‘I always felt that the biggest investment Tottenham could do is what they did in previous seasons, which was to keep their best players. That’s the best investment you can do,’ Mourinho continued.</p>
      <p>‘Some clubs can do both – keep the best players and buy other top players. Some, they don’t and they have to make a choice. I feel Spurs showed clearly that they felt the group was fantastic, with a lot of English players, and they were close to creating history.’</p>
