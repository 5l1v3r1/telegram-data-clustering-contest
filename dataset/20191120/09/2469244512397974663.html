      <h2>Catherine Jeffs has been counting the number of plastic pieces collected in 2019</h2>

      <p>A beach cleaner has picker her 100,000th piece of plastic at Woolacombe.</p>
      <p>Catherine Jeffs has been helping clean the beach at Woolacombe for many years, but since retiring has been able to do it every day, rain or shine.</p>
      <p>She said: “Most of my beach cleaning is on beautiful Woolacombe beach, between Mill Rock and Black Rock which is very clean.</p>
      <p>“Last year I set myself the target to collect 250 pieces of plastic each day, but this year out of interest I recorded each day the number of items I have picked up, and I’ve just picked up my 100,000th piece.</p>
      <p>“Some days there is very little to collect, but on days of very high tides along with stormy weather, there is much more. Even I have been amazed at how many items I have collected.”</p>

      <p>She added the items fall into three main categories; fishing industry debris such as rope and net, single-use plastic, for bottles and wrapping, and microplastics, which are tiny pieces of broken-down plastic and nurdles.</p>
      <p>“Some days I just collect one bag of debris, other days can be three or four, which gets very heavy,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I am just one of several people who do beach cleaning at Woolacombe. Although it is good to clear up the plastic, it would be even better if it wasn’t there.”</p>
      <p>Catherine is also a member of Plastic Free Woolacombe, which is encouraging everyone to reduce the amount of single-use plastic they use and where possible reuse or recycle it.</p>
