        <b>Shares in The Medicines Company have leapt on rumours that Novartis is eyeing a takeover of the company and its promising new cardiovascular drug inclisiran.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A report from <i>Bloomberg</i> also suggests that other buyers are interested in MedCo as it prepares to file for approval of inclisiran – a gene-silencing drug targeting PCSK9 that can reduce cholesterol with twice-yearly dosing, even in patients on maximum doses of statins.</p>
      <p>MedCo has a market value of around $4.7bn, says the news agency, which cites people close to the matter as the source of the rumour but hasn’t indicated what Novartis – or indeed another party – may be prepared to pay for the company.</p>
      <p>If approved, <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/tmc_preps_filings_for_inclisiran_after_final_phase_3_trials_hit_the_mark_1302663">inclisiran</a></u> could pose a major challenge to established antibody-based PCSK9 inhibitors, namely Repatha (evolocumab) from Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron’s Praluent (alirocumab), which are dosed more frequently (either monthly or bimonthly).</p>
      <p>Repatha and Praluent have struggled to make headway in the market mainly due to payer resistance, forcing their developers to slash prices from $14,000 per year at launch to around $6,000.</p>
      <p>Analysts have suggested that inclisiran may also be priced at a discount to the antibody drugs on launch, and could quickly grow to blockbuster sales levels.</p>
      <p>Novartis isn’t commenting on the speculation, but <i>Bloomberg</i> analyst Sam Fazeli says that inclisiran would slot neatly into the Swiss group’s cardiovascular portfolio alongside Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan), its heart failure medicine which after a slow start in the market has gathered pace and made $1.2bn in the first nine months of the year.</p>
      <p>Novartis’ hopes of further growth for Entresto were <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/novartis_heart_failure_drug_entresto_fails_to_impress,_could_limit_growth_1295471">dented</a></u> earlier this year however when the drug failed to show an impact in a particular form of heart failure, characterised by normal or preserved ejection fraction from the heart, in a phase 3 trial.</p>
      <p>At the American Heart Association (AHA) meeting last weekend MedCo reported additional data from the ORION-9 trial of inclisiran showing 50% reductions in LDL-cholesterol in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia, an inherited condition characterised by very high cholesterol levels.</p>
      <p>MedCo has said it intends to file the drug for approval in the US before the end of the year and in Europe in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>While some analysts think it could be a blockbuster drug, others suggest it could be a slow-burner, gathering momentum after results from a cardiovascular outcomes study – ORION-4 – which is due to report in 2024.</p>
      <p>Shares in the company rose almost 20% in the wake of the <i>Bloomberg</i> report.</p>
