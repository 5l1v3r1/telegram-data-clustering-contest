      <h1>Paul Gascoigne makes bold prediction about Tottenham under Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Paul Gascoigne has been speaking about Jose Mourinho, Mauricio Pochettino and Spurs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:05:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Paul Gascoigne has opened up on the departure of <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and what Jose <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> can offer at Tottenham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> parted ways with Pochettino after five years on Tuesday night, with Daniel Levy 'reluctantly' coming to the decision.</p>
      <p>Pochettino helped the club to four successive top-four finishes in the Premier League but failed to win a trophy.</p>
      <p>Tottenham made the Champions League final in June but lost to Liverpool and their form this season has never recovered from a poor end to the 2018/19 league campaign.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has now landed the job and Gascoigne has provided his verdict on the two quickfire decisions from Spurs.</p>
      <p>"I think it was always a matter of time. I was at the England game the other week and I got wind of it," Gascoigne told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Obviously it's not nice for anyone in football to get sacked but Man City are putting pressure on everybody and they are all looking for the best.</p>
      <p>"As far as I'm concerned, Jose Mourinho is the best. He is an unbelievable manager. Alex Ferguson was an unbelievable manager and the best ever but Jose Mourinho is not far from him. You can't get any better than him.</p>
      <p>"I was at the legends game and we went to Tottenham's training ground and Jose Mourinho was there having a look around.</p>
      <p>"With Mourinho labelled the 'special one' and Tottenham's training ground a special place, the two go together really.</p>
      <p>"All you have to look at is his trophy cabinet. The players haven't won anything. If your playing for that guy, you know you are going to win trophies. Tottenham's future looks bright."</p>
