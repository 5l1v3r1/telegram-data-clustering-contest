      <p>Japan logged a goods trade surplus for the first time in four months in October after a plunge in imports amid falling crude oil and other commodities prices more than offset a drop in exports, government data showed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The country’s goods trade surplus stood at ¥17.27 billion ($159 million), marking a turnaround from a revised ¥124.82 billion deficit in September, according to a preliminary report by the Finance Ministry.</p>
      <p>In the reporting month, exports dropped 9.2 percent from a year earlier to ¥6.58 trillion, marking the 11th consecutive monthly decline, hit by weakening demand for vehicles and aircraft parts from the United States.</p>
      <p>But imports plunged 14.8 percent, falling for the sixth straight month, as shipments of crude oil, liquefied natural gas and other energy commodities decreased in both value and volume.</p>
      <p>A ministry official said the drop in exports and imports was also partly attributable to heavy rains and a powerful typhoon that hit Japan in the reporting month, which disrupted supply chains and suspended factory operations.</p>
      <p>Private-sector economists said the Oct. 1 increase in the consumption tax appears to have led to a drop in imports, but that it is difficult to assess the impact because the natural disasters apparently played a larger part.</p>
      <p>“While exports are expected to remain sluggish because of the U.S.-China trade war, imports are also likely to decrease amid weak domestic demand following the tax increase,” said Toru Suehiro, senior market economist at Mizuho Securities Co.</p>
      <p>Suehiro forecasts Japan’s trade balance will move narrowly around the break-even line for the time being.</p>
      <p>By region, exports to China fell 10.3 percent from a year earlier to ¥1.32 trillion, weighed down by declining shipments of plastic raw materials and auto parts.</p>
      <p>Imports from Japan’s biggest trading partner sank 15.4 percent to ¥1.59 trillion, leaving Japan with a deficit with China for the 19th straight month, at ¥269.87 billion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Japan’s trade surplus against the whole of Asia, including China, grew 36.7 percent to ¥299.56 billion, helped by increased shipments of steel products to Thailand.</p>
      <p>Among other partners, Japan’s trade surplus with the United States shrank 2.7 percent from a year earlier to ¥557.54 billion amid sluggish auto-related exports.</p>
      <p>With the European Union, Japan ran a deficit of ¥46.46 billion, due partly to a decline in exports of aircraft engine parts to the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The figures were compiled on a customs-cleared basis.</p>
