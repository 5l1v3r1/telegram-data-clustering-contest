      <h2>This could make for some very tempting savings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:22:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:22</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Delahaye, Victoria Jones</a></address>
      <p>Florida's Walt Disney World and Universal Studios are on many people's bucket lists.</p>
      <p>But they are pricey holidays, particularly when you have to pay for a family.</p>
      <p>It might interest anyone considering a holiday that adults can now bag tickets to both resorts for the same price as kids' tickets.</p>

      <p>That's because Attraction Tickets Direct has brought back its popular 'Adults pay kids prices' deal for theme parks including Walt Disney World and Universal, the Mirror report.</p>
      <p>The best part is that there's a wide variety of ticket options included as part of the offer, whether you're after a <a href="https://fave.co/35k3NOQ">14 Day Ultimate Ticket</a> to Disney or a <a href="https://fave.co/3468ag7">three-park ticket</a> to Universal Orlando.</p>
      <p>Oh, and there are even <a href="https://fave.co/344cTyJ">combination tickets</a> to both resorts if you're planning to explore a whole host of the parks.</p>
      <p>There's more good news too as the deals are valid for trips in both 2019 and 2020, ideal if you've been thinking of a last minute trip or you're looking to plan ahead for next year.</p>
      <p>You can already book the deals on the <a href="https://fave.co/2rWPUaJ">Attraction Tickets Direct website</a> , but you'll need to do so by midnight on Friday, November 29 (Black Friday itself) when the deal expires.</p>
      <p>It's also worth noting that tickets are subject to availability.</p>
      <p>It's not the only deal that the website has running on Orlando getaways.</p>
      <p>In fact, as part of its Black Friday offerings - which it is actually running all through November - families can bag discounts of five per cent off Walt Disney World hotel stays and park tickets, as well as five per cent off Universal Hotels packages .</p>
