        <li>London’s most notorious pocket of luxury real estate is a mile-long road of mansions known as “Billionaires Row.” It has a reputation for money, scandal, murder, and secrecy.</li>
        <li>The Towers is the largest mansion ont he road, and is now rotten, overgrown, and falling apart.</li>
        <li>It was once owned by actress Gracie Fields. Saudi royals bought it in 1989, but never seem to have showed up. It has stood derelict for years.</li>

          <a href="https://www.insider.com/inside-london-billionaires-row-property-interactive-2019-11">This post is part of an interactive Insider series profiling Billionaires Row.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The largest, most secretive, and most imposing property on The Bishops Avenue – known better as London’s Billionaires Row – is The Towers. Even though it is falling apart.</p>
      <p>The mansion was one of 10 homes on the road bought by the Saudi royal family in 1989, against a tense geopolitical backdrop that would result in Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and the first Gulf War.</p>
      <p>The Towers cost then-ruler King Fahd £25 million ($40 million,) less than half the original asking price, and was built on part of the site of the mansion of British actress Gracie Fields.</p>

      <p>Fields’ old house was knocked down, and replaced with an L-shaped redbrick mansion, which rises up behind two huge roadside iron gates which swing off mock-Tudor pillars topped with lanterns.</p>
      <p>Official for the local government, Barnet Council, said in 1991 that The Towers was “too theatrical for some” and sat at a “cocky angle to the street scene.”</p>
      <p>30 years after King Fahd’s purchase, the house and its grounds are deep in the grip of decay.</p>

      <p>The Saudi royals never came. In 2013 the property was sold on to Birch Ventures Limited, a shell company based on the tax haven of the Isle of Man.</p>
      <p>In its long abandonment, The Towers became a target for squatters, who moved in, posted a notice on the door setting out their rights, and changed the locks.</p>
      <p>One of the squatters who hopped the fence was Chris Coates, who spoke to Insider about taking over the ruined mansion.</p>

      <p>“There were boxes of personal possessions from whoever had lived there, I mean it was huge,” Coates said.</p>
      <p>“To me it felt like camping out in the wild, it had such a huge garden.”</p>
      <p>“We were told it had been empty since pre-war times and it felt like that. There wasn’t any furniture in it, or anything, I remember we slept in one big room on mattresses.”</p>

      <p>“From the stuff we found it felt like they were socialites living between the wars – there were invitations to garden parties and the like.”</p>
      <p>Coates and his companions were kicked out by police after a month, and moved into Kingsdene, one of three other empty houses on the same road.</p>

      <p>The house was a base for members of the The Children of God church (later known as The Family International), which is widely described as a cult.</p>
      <p>According to Coates, police told the squatters that cult members who lived at Kingsdene had been arrested for running a rental TV scam.</p>
      <p>The Family International confirmed to Insider that members did indeed live at three houses on Hampstead Lane in 1975, but said they had no records of the alleged scam.</p>

      <p>The scene inside The Towers in modern times tells a story of neglect, and vast wealth.</p>
      <p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRCzSTHXVfL2BMS-GCvX0WA">and urban explorer David Cripps</a> sneaked into The Towers in 2018. Here’s what he found:</p>
      <p>Moss can be seen covering the floors, while plants and shrubs grow out of cracks in the spiral staircase and walls. Damp seeps into every inch.</p>
      <p>An empty swimming pool, at its centre a column which once supported a desert island, amplifies the smallest sounds. Skeletons of pigeons, rats, and mice litter the floor.</p>
