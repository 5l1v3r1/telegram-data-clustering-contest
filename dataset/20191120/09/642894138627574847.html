      <p>“Digital transformation is changing the world as we know it,” says Cuthbertson.</p>
      <p>“As Cisco is transforming its business to a software and subscription-focused business model, our partners are transforming with us, so our short- to mid-term priorities are to guide them on this transformation journey through enablement, while helping them build successful and profitable businesses that service the needs of our collective customers.”</p>
