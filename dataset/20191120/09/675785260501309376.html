      <h1>Jose Mourinho's salary at Tottenham as former Man Utd boss replaces Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham manager - penning a three-and-a-half-year deal after the Argentine was sacked on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:10:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:10</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho will reportedly earn double the salary of Mauricio Pochettino at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> - pocketing £15million-a-year over the course of his stay in north London.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Mourinho has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal with Spurs after Pochettino was axed by owner Daniel Levy on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>He joins with Tottenham 14th in the Premier League - 11 points off the top four as Mourinho is tasked with resurrecting their season.</p>
      <p>But Spurs are well-placed to reach the last 16 of the Champions League as they look to follow up on last season's campaign where they reached the final - only to lose to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in Madrid.</p>

      <p>And Mourinho will trouser twice what Pochettino earned, report the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705097/Tottenham-appointed-Jose-Mourinho-new-manager-contract-2022-23-season.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>"I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," Mourinho said after being appointed by Spurs.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>While appreciating the job Pochettino has done at Spurs, Levy has hailed the appointment of Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham chairman said: "In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>"He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. </p>
      <p>"We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room."</p>
