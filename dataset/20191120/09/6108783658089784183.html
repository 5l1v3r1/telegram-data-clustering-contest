      <h1>Crash Bandicoot Worlds December announcment rumoured</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:40:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wright</a></address>
      <h3>A 4chan leak is bolstered by new advertisements.</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/crash-bandicoot-worlds/">Crash Bandicoot Worlds</a> </i>has been rumoured by a leak that’s appeared on 4chan. The alleged leak is bolstered by bus ads alongside a new PlayStation video.</p>
      <p>First, <a href="http://boards.4channel.org/v/thread/485431118/crash-bandicoot-2020">the 4chan post in question</a> reports that <i>Crash Bandicoot Worlds </i>is currently in development by Toys for Bob and Vicarious Visions over at Activision, and will be announced officially at The Game Awards in December. The title is said to be <i>Mario 3D World</i>-like, and introduces three new masks to familiar <i>Crash Bandicoot </i>gameplay: the lunar, sun and eclipse masks.</p>
      <p>While the leak has yet to be confirmed, fans have noticed a strange new <i>Crash </i>mask that’s made an appearance in a recent PlayStation video. Seen at 0:16 below, the mask is one that hasn’t been seen in a <i>Crash </i>game to date.</p>

      <p>Finally, the 4chan post suggests that UK bus advertisements sporting a render of Crash Bandicoot (below) are using the character’s new render from <i>Crash Bandicoot Worlds</i>.</p>

      <p>Neither Activision nor Sony have made comment on the rumours. <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/game-awards-2019-nominees-announced/">The Game Awards will be held on 12 December</a>, so we’ll likely have confirmation (or not) then.</p>
