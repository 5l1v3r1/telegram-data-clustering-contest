      <p>A police sergeant who dangled a slice of pepperoni pizza over a Jewish colleague’s meal has narrowly clung on to his job.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Gary Jacobs, 43, said ‘whoops, I will eat the incriminating evidence’ after a piece of the meat dropped onto the junior officer’s special kosher pizza.</p>
      <p>A disciplinary hearing at Sussex Police headquarters heard the woman, referred to only as PC A, felt ‘mocked for her faith’ following the incident.</p>
      <p>Sgt Jacobs, based in Crawley, argued it had been a misguided joke-gone-wrong and accepted that his actions amounted to misconduct, but denied gross misconduct.</p>
      <p>However, the panel decided his behaviour constituted the latter and warned him his career as a police officer was on the verge of ruin.</p>
      <p>The panel chair old him he had ‘never found any case that has fallen so close’ to dismissal.</p>

      <p>The incident occurred on March 8 when Sgt Jacobs, PC A and other colleagues were relaxing before a shift eating pizza, the hearing was told.</p>

      <p>Amy Clarke, bringing the allegation on behalf of the police force, told the tribunal: ‘PC A had deliberately ordered a pizza that was compliant with her dietary requirements.</p>
      <p>‘Sgt Jacobs picked up a piece of pepperoni pizza and dangled it over or near PC A’s food.</p>
      <p>‘A piece of the pepperoni fell onto PC A’s pizza.’</p>
      <p>That was despite him being aware of PC A’s faith and another officer having just pointed out that her kosher pizza should be kept separate, Ms Clarke said.</p>
      <p>The panel heard Sgt Jacobs ‘waved’ his slice over PC A’s chicken pizza saying ‘technically not touching’.</p>
      <p>When a piece of meat fell onto her meal he remarked: ‘Whoops, I will eat the incriminating evidence.’</p>
      <p>The Jewish officer, who had only recently joined the force, was left feeling ‘embarrassed, isolated and as if she was being mocked for her faith’, Ms Clarke said.</p>
      <p>Colin Banham, representing Sgt Jacobs, said: ‘No-one says this was a malicious act.’</p>
      <p>Mr Banham added it was ‘an incident that he bitterly regrets and one that he is clearly remorseful about’.</p>
      <p>‘There was no intention to contaminate food,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>Mr Banham argued that the incident was not pre-meditated and happened in a ‘jocular atmosphere’ when officers were relaxing before a shift began.</p>
      <p>He told the panel that Sgt Jacobs had been under various pressures in his home and work life at the time.</p>

      <p>Trevor Bowles, who has been managing Sgt Jacobs since he changed teams following the pizza incident, said he had been impressed with his work, adding: ‘He has substantial potential if his skills are channelled in the right way.’</p>
      <p>Panel chair Michael Salter said Sgt Jacobs’ actions were ‘serious and they caused discredit to the police service’.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sgt Jacobs, he said: ‘Officer, I cannot tell you how close you came to losing your job today.</p>
      <p>‘I have done this job for a number of years now.</p>
      <p>‘I have not found any case that has fallen so close to the boundary as yours has.’</p>
      <p>Sgt Jacobs will receive a final written warning as a result of the hearing.</p>
