      <p><u>ASi</u><a href="https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/C8SRCvlXQH7Yp1LUyXF13?domain=as-interface.net"><u>-5</u></a> offers superior performance and usability over ASi-3, delivering 1.27 ms cycle time, 200m cable length and 96 slaves per segment.</p>
      <p>The Renesas ASSP delivers a Â fieldbus integration option for developers working with sensors, actuators, and other industrial equipment requiring fieldbus connectivity.</p>
      <p>The ASI4U-V5 ASSP features a fully verified and field-proven firmware that reduces the complexity associated with ASi-5 implementations, allowing users to minimize design risks.</p>
      <p>The ASSP is fully backwards compatible with ASi-3 devices while incorporating the shorter cycle times, higher bandwidth resulting from the use of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), enhanced diagnostics, and state-of-the-art robustness associated with the ASi-5 standard.</p>
      <p>The ASSP also supports all bus topologies, including line, star, and tree. Users can also take advantage of easy and cost-efficient integration with other industrial protocols such as IO-Link and HART.</p>
