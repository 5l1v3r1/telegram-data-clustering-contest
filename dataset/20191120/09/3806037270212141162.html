      <p>The regular <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/jaguar">2019 Jaguar XJ</a> has gone out of production earlier this year in July, but before saying goodbye to the iconic model — which will soon be replaced with an all-electric lineup — the British automaker is releasing one last Collection Special Edition, limited to 300 cars, in celebration of the model’s 50-year heritage.</p>
      <p>Based on the design of the long-wheelbase XJL Supercharged, the luxury sedan comes in three color options: Santorini Black, Yulong White, or the classic British Racing Green. With various Ebony, Mineral, Ivory, and London Tan interior packages to choose from, Jaguar has also included special detailing that celebrates the car’s special status, such as “XJ Collection” branding on the metal tread plates, and tags on the dashboard reading “XJ Collection One of 300.” The limited-edition then sits on four 20-inch five-spoke wheels finished in Satin Grey. As to its performance, all 300 of the collection will boast 470 horsepower and 424 pound-feet of torque.</p>
      <p>Limited only to the US market, the Jaguar XJ Collection Special Edition is now available, and will sell for $86,025 USD.</p>
