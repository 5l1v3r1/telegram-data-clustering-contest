      <p>It has been more or less confirmed that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-information-about-the-galaxy-s10-lite-leaks-online/">Samsung is working on a slightly cheaper version of the Samsung Galaxy S10</a>, and now we have a lot more detail on the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite specs.</p>
      <p>According to reliable Samsung leaker Ishan Agarwal the Samsung Galaxy S10 Lite (SM-G770F) will feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor and the following camera specs: 48MP (Main) + 5MP (Depth) +12MP (Wide angle) &amp; 32MP (Selfie)</p>

      <p>We have earlier heard it will be available in black, white, and blue. Other rumoured specs include a 6.7-inch Super AMOLED display,  8 GB + 128 GB , 8 GB + 256 GB,  and 4500 mah with 45W fast charging support, running Android Pie.</p>
      <p>The handset is expected to hit the market in only a few weeks, in December this year. The handset is designed to address the success of the cheaper version of the iPhone, which has been unexpectedly popular after years of falling iPhone sales.</p>
      <p>The specs obviously suggest a pretty powerful handset, and hopefully, Samsung will meet expectations regarding the price and accessibility of the device.</p>
