        <b>Learn to curl at a number of upcoming clinics</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Curling season has begun at the Barriere Recreation Society facility. The first rocks were thrown on Wednesday, Oct. 30, at the Open Daytime Curling.</p>
      <p>The ice plant was re-installed last year and now all the technical issues have been corrected. Participants are enjoying great ice.</p>
      <p>Many new and returning curlers have joined the club and there will be a series of curling clinics held on Wednesday, Nov. 20, 27, and Dec. 4, from 7 to 9 p.m. in the evening. Certified coaches will be on hand to assist with skill development, and curling equipment is available.</p>
      <p>Come out and try curling for the first time or brush up on your curling skills. There is a drop in fee of $2 and a great opportunity to meet friends or neighbours.</p>
      <p>The current leagues at the Barriere Curling Club are Wednesdays from 1 to 3 p.m., and Fridays from 7 â€“ 9 p.m. Both leagues are open to anyone wishing to curl, either as an individual or as a team.</p>
