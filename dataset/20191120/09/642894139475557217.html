      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:02:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:02</time> by <a rel="author">Calix</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.calix.com/">Calix</a> (NYSE: CALX) today announced that <a href="http://www.cityfibre.com/">CityFibre</a>, the UK’s leading alternative provider of wholesale full fibre infrastructure, is now benefiting from market-leading network and service performance results across its city-wide full fibre network roll-outs.</p>
      <p>Just over a year since the original partnership <a href="https://www.calix.com/press-release/2018/09--september-/cityfibre-adds-brain-to-its-fiber-brawn-powering-the-uks-most-ad.html">announcement</a>, Calix <a href="https://www.calix.com/platforms/axos.html">AXOS</a> is now powering live gigabit speed services for CityFibre across seven cities, with 19 more to come. The 26 UK cities named so far represent the first 2 million homes of the company’s overall target to serve over 5 million homes by 2025. Through its technology partnership with Calix and a laser focus on continuous improvement, CityFibre is achieving exceptional service delivery, end-customer satisfaction, network reliability and service uptime results across its FTTP networks.</p>
      <p>As well as providing significant and tangible benefits for its partners, investment from a new generation of competitive infrastructure builders such as CityFibre has galvanised the UK market. Previously in this sector, service performance issues, low bandwidth consumer services, and high prices had become the norm.</p>
      <p>CityFibre’s partnership with Calix includes the strategic introduction of NG-PON2 to its existing GPON architecture. Technology trials that have taken place so far provide a further proof point for the Calix everyPON strategy, which enables communications service providers (CSPs) to choose the network technology that is right for them at any time.</p>
      <p>“Calix delivers both a best-in-class platform and a strategic approach that have been instrumental in helping us build a network that will scale and increase the performance advantage we have built,” said David Tomalin, group chief technology officer for CityFibre. “Our service provider partners are now benefiting from access to the next generation wholesale network, allowing them to differentiate on speed, reliability and service quality in a highly competitive retail market. Importantly, due to the high capacity and future scalability of our network, this competitive advantage will continue to grow – even as subscriber demands increase.”</p>
      <p>CityFibre is the UK’s only advanced-intelligence, wholesale infrastructure company with a network deployment strategy capable of serving all verticals, including consumer, public sector, enterprise and mobile, over the same ‘well-planned’ full fibre, citywide networks. As CityFibre continues to deploy and leverage the high-density <a href="https://www.calix.com/platforms/axos/axos-systems/e9-intelligent-edge-system.html">E9-2 Intelligent Edge System</a>, it will soon benefit from the multi-wavelength capability of NG-PON2, which enables multiple operators to deliver 10G services over a single fibre today and offers a route to providing affordable 100Gbps services in the near future.</p>
      <p>“CityFibre is the exact kind of forward-thinking innovator we work best with, and we are excited to expand this relationship as they continue to push broadband performance forward in the UK for the benefit of communities that have been chronically underserved by the incumbent provider,” said Michael Weening, executive VP of field operations for Calix. “We are growing our NG-PON2 customer base across the world and have established ourselves as the unquestioned industry leader in next generation networks. Our everyPON strategy reaffirms that when a service provider chooses AXOS, it is choosing a future proof platform. CityFibre has chosen GPON and will be adding the most advanced PON available, NG-PON2, with no change in systems, operating procedures, or the platform. Simply put, this is the last network they will ever build thanks to fibre, which is almost infinitely expandable with each generation of PON, and the world’s only software defined access platform – AXOS.”</p>
