      <p>Andy Hibbs, who has worked as a lobster fisherman for 31 years, was travelling south-east at 5.45am to unload his catch at Granville when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>‘I was just going along and one bilge alarm went off and then the second one started going and I thought, “something has gone wrong here”,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘It was still dark and there was smoke everywhere so I did not know where the water was coming from but once I did it was easy to sort it.</p>
      <p>‘I think the crew thought it was funny but then I think they realised it was pretty serious.</p>
      <p>‘There was a lot of water in my boat at the time – probably about 2.5ft.’</p>

      <p>Mr Hibbs added that although his pumps managed to deal with the water, he was not able to move more than a few knots and needed a tow from the lifeboat, Sir Max Aitken III, to help him move against the tide.</p>
      <p>‘It was pretty close. It is definitely the closest call I have had for a long time but it is just one of those things that you just have to get on and deal with,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I called the Coastguard and said that I was in no immediate danger but that I might need someone to bring a pump out but I did not need it in the end.</p>
      <p>‘It was a great start to the day – the boys found it quite amusing.’</p>
