      <p>TORONTO — A canvas by Pablo Picasso will hit the Toronto auction block tonight alongside offerings from some of Canada's most treasured artists.</p>
      <p>The Heffel Fine Art Auction House says Picasso's "Femme au chapeau" will lead its fall sale with a pre-auction estimate between $8 million to $10 million.</p>
      <p>The 1941 oil-on-canvas depicts photographer Dora Maar, who during her relationship with Picasso served as the principal subject of his "Weeping Woman" series.</p>
      <p>Canadian highlights include a 1912 work by Emily Carr depicting a First Nations village in B.C.</p>
      <p>Heffel says "Street, Alert Bay" is the first major Carr canvas to come to market in years and could fetch between $2 million and $3 million.</p>
      <p>Comic legend Steve Martin is selling one of the several Lawren Harris paintings in his collection.</p>
      <p>The Group of Seven painter's 1928 oil-on-board "Mountain Sketch LXX" is expected to hammer down for between $300,000 and $500,000.</p>
      <p>Five works by Jean Paul Riopelle will be on offer, including 1955's "Composition / Sans titre leads," which is estimated to bring in between $950,000 and $1.25 million.</p>
      <p>Three A.Y. Jackson paintings consigned by the Art Gallery of Ontario will also be open for bids.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 20, 2019.</p>
