      <p>Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar met Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on Wednesday a meeting that comes in the midst of political churning in Maharashtra that was put under President's rule a week ago after no party mustered enough numbers to form a government in the state.</p>
      <p>"Due to the prevalence of Presidential Rule in the state, your urgent intervention is highly necessitated. I shall be grateful if you take immediate steps to initiate massive relief measures and ameliorate the miseries of the distressed farmers" Pawar had written in a letter to the prime minister over the farm crisis in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>"I have collected data on crop damage from two districts, but damage because of excessive rains extends to rest of Maharashtra, including Marathwada and Vidarbha. I am collecting details and information regarding the same, which should be sent to you at the earliest," Pawar added.</p>
      <p>Pawar further said, "The farmers have complained that they haven't yet received the loan waiver. In the wake of the recent damage, the current farm loans should also be waived."</p>
      <p>Today's meeting of the NCP leader with the prime minister comes amidst speculations that the NCP may cobble together an alliance with the BJP to form the government in the state.</p>
      <p>On Monday Pawar had met Sonia Gandhi at her residence in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital but the NCP leader said they did not hold any talks about government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>BJP won 105 seats in the 288-member assembly, the Congress 44 seats, the NCP 54 seats and the Shiv Sena bagged 56 seats.</p>
      <p>BJP, which emerged as the single largest party, could not stake claim to form a government as its ally Shiv Sena remained firm on rotating the Chief Minister's post and equal sharing of Cabinet berths.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena parted its ways with BJP only to explore ways to form a government. It, however, failed to prove the support of the required number of MLAs in the time given by Governor BS Koshyari.</p>
      <p>The Governor had then invited NCP, the third-largest party, to prove its ability to form the government failing which President's Rule was imposed in the state on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena is now in parleys with the Congress and NCP to form a government in the state.</p>
