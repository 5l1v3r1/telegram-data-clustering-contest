      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/stormzy">Stormzy</a> has opened up about the emotion he felt following his triumphant <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> set in the summer, saying “I thought I’d fucked it.”</p>

          <b>Read More: <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/stormzy-puts-legendary-performance-glastonbury">Alright, doubters – Stormzy’s Glastonbury headline set was a platform to elevate others, a statement of intent and bloody brilliant</a></b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speaking to <i><a href="https://www.qthemusic.com/">Q</a>, </i>Stormzy said he was so upset with his performance afterwards that he came off stage and cried for close to an hour. Stormzy revealed that his in-ear sound monitors “blew” early on in the set, leaving him without sound for the rest of the performance.</p>
      <p>Stormzy said: “It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. When I walked off stage I thought I’d fucked it. I thought it was the worst thing I’d ever done. I came off stage and thought I’d totally, absolutely blown it. I was crying for, like, an hour. I was in hysterics. Heartbroken, man.”</p>
      <p>Afterwards, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/emily-eavis">Emily Eavis</a> gave Stormzy a memory stick of the performance. “About halfway through [watching it] I was like, ‘Shit, it all went all right,'” Stormzy added.</p>

      <p>Yesterday (November 19), <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-announces-second-album-heavy-is-the-head-2569480#JSUQtUmbbT8riZtx.99">Stormzy announced that he’ll be releasing his second album, ‘Heavy Is The Head’, next month.</a></p>
      <p>The record is set for release on 13th December and sees him teaming up with the likes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/headie-one">Headie One</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> and H.E.R across sixteen tracks.</p>
      <p>It also includes his recent releases across 2019, namely <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-sounds-of-the-skeng-single-sir-spyro-2545436">‘Sounds of the Skeng’</a>, ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-announces-new-single-crown-out-this-week-2511433">Crown’</a>, Wiley Flow and ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-takes-aim-at-boris-johnson-on-new-track-vossi-bop-2481150">Vossi Bop</a>’ which gave Stormzy <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-scores-first-ever-uk-number-one-single-vossi-bop-2484057">his first ever UK Number One single.</a></p>
      <p>The record’s title is also a lyric taken from ‘Crown’, while the artwork sees him looking wistfully at the Banksy-designed bulletproof vest he wore during his Glastonbury 2019 headline set.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/stormzy-puts-legendary-performance-glastonbury">In a five star review of the show, NME said:</a> “Stormzy’s Glastonbury was a reflection of the time we live in now. Being the second-youngest headliner in the festival’s history and the first black UK solo artist to have such a high billing would have weighed a lot on his shoulders.</p>
      <p>“With anticipation before the night apprehensive, Stormzy does not put a foot wrong throughout. He shows exactly why he deserves to be here.”</p>
