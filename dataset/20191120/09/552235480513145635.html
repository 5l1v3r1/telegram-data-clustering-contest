      <h2>The no screen trial is taking place today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:50:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>All schools and nurseries have banned the use of tablets and other devices  today in East Ayrshire to encourage kids to talk more.</p>
      <p>Childrens’ speech skills are being hampered after spending too much time on smartphones, games consoles and tablets, research has shown.</p>
      <p>Calls have been made for East Ayrshire Council to run the ‘No Screens Day’ every week.</p>
      <p>Children aged five to 15 spend an average of two hours 11 minutes a day online.</p>
      <p>Some nurseries in East Ayrshire have already asked parents to stop using phones when they pick up their kids.</p>
      <p>A report presented to councillors said: “Early years staff report significant impact on children’s development as a result of increased screen time.”</p>
      <p>The council’s strategic education manager Janie Allen told cabinet councillors it is about having face to face-to-face conversations rather than looking at mobiles and screens.</p>
      <p>She  pointed to US research which revealed increases in handheld screen time cause bigger risks of speech delay.</p>
      <p>The ‘No Screens Day’ was approved at a cabinet meeting last month.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the meeting, Councillor Neil McGhee (Labour) said: “I think this is desperately needed and it is a step in the right direction. I am disappointed it has taken so long to be acted on.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “The digital era is going too fast for some people, in particular children.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Fiona Campbell (SNP) described the evidence of the negative impact of screens as “shocking.”</p>
      <p>SNP councillor Gordon Jenkins suggested time-out for screens once a week while the meeting heard the November date is an evaluation exercise.</p>
      <p>Councillor Clare Maitland (SNP) said: “I was disappointed it was going to be only one day.”</p>
      <p>Pointing out the positives of technology, she said children are also interactive on devices.</p>
      <p>She added: “It is about building in good practice.”</p>
      <p>Conservative councillor Tom Cook said: “The big issue in secondary schools is how to we get them off their phones.”</p>
      <p>He added: “You go to restaurants and see families on their phones and none of them are talking to each other.”</p>
      <p>Too much TV also puts children off playing with toys, research presented at the meeting revealed.</p>
      <p>The report to councillors said studies suggest limiting screen time and encouraging play-based interactions among children may reduce risk of behavioural, social and emotional problems.</p>
      <p>The screen-free day would promote the benefits of reducing time staring at devices and allow teachers and staff to get the message out to families.</p>
      <p>It has been jointly co-ordinated by East Ayrshire Speech and Language Therapy Team and East Ayrshire Council.</p>
      <p>A council statement said evidence shows increased screen time can have a negative effect on attention, speech and listening skills and children’s weight. It can also impact movement and cognitive abilities  as well as behavioural, social and emotional issues.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Onthank nursery staff have been working hard to boost speech, language and development.</p>
      <p>The early years centre has achieved a communication friendly environment accreditation. Another seven nurseries are aiming to get the accreditation too.</p>
