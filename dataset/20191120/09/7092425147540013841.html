          <b>Bad new for Love Island fans.Â </b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot happened on <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/love-island-fans-raving-amber-gills-dramatic-new-hair-transformation-343432"><i>Love Island</i></a> this year and a lot has happened since the contestants left the villa.</p>
      <p>There's been break ups, make ups, people moving in together and others finally becoming official - so, it's safe to say we were excited to see the drama unfold at the Christmas reunion special.</p>
      <p>However, it looks like that's not going to happen.</p>

      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/reality/love-island-christmas-special-reunion-20914334"><i>OK! Magazine</i></a>: "The cast don't think there are any plans for a Christmas reunion like last year, but they haven't been given a straight answer.</p>
      <p>"A few of the islanders have seen the producers since leaving the villa and there was a bit of a reunion at ITV Palooza last week and the topic was brought up but quickly shut down.</p>
      <p>"Questions were asked about the possibility of an on-screen reunion, but they were all ignored by producers."</p>

      <p>Some are saying the reason it has been cancelled is because the host, Caroline Flack, is currently filming <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/start-date-winter-love-island-finally-revealed-340985"><i>Winter Love Island</i></a> over in Cape Town, however, others are saying there's just no interest for it.</p>
