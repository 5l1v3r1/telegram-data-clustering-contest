      <p>Rats are ruining the life of a Cullompton pensioner who says her housing association are refusing to help.</p>
      <p>Mrs Georgina Rowe, 73, from Water Meadow, says she has had a rat problem since January and has called on Westward Housing Association to help.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting nowhere in getting help,” she said. “Nobody will come and do anything about the problem.</p>
      <p>“Rats are up in the loft, we found one dead one outside the front door, and we found another dead one outside in the carport. I had to get a friend around to help deal with it.</p>
      <p>"It’s a big problem; I’m having counselling for depression and anxiety, my health is suffering because you can’t sleep at night times because of the noise. I have been in touch with Westward Housing Association who have been after I kicked up a fuss. One of the surveyors came out and looked at it, but they wouldn’t go up in the loft to look; I think they were scared of the rats. Environmental Health are also on the case.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Rowe has said that repairs need to be done on some roof tiles and holes to help ease the problem.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been here for more than ten years. We had rats two years ago, but pest control dealt with it, and that was that. Now I’ve been trying to solve this problem for over a year.</p>
      <p>“The electric wires are being affected; they could catch fire. I am not worried about the property, so long as I can get out with my cat. </p>
      <p>“I don’t know why they aren’t doing anything. I never thought there would be all this trouble. I thought they would just come and deal with it.”</p>

      <p>Westward Homes say they have been working to assist Mrs Rowe with her concerns for nearly two years.</p>
      <p>Vanessa Gray-Locke, Communications Manager at Westward Housing Association, said: “Westward commissioned a pest risk management proposal from Mitie originally, then in May this year Mitie became Rentokil; so the plan moved to them, and all recommendations have been acted on by Westward.</p>
      <p>“Also, two of our surveyors and a colleague from our repairs contractor MD Group have visited our customer at 12 Water Meadow Close, and I can confirm that they have been in the loft to inspect reports of rats. We have photographs of the rat traps in each corner of the loft taken by our surveyors, and none have been triggered or show any signs of rats, so there is no evidence of them in the property.</p>
      <p>“We are working with the local authority in this instance, and we also have a 12-month monitoring contract booked by Westward with Rentokil to keep checking until May 2020.</p>

      <p>“Westward carried out external rodent prevention work including on the roof tiles, brick walls, wall vents, rainwater downpipes and the blocking off of a redundant drain. Westward has also blocked all vents except for one plastic one which is needed and has been changed to metal.</p>
      <p>“One final element of this work that requires external scaffolding was identified and has been approved by Westward to be scheduled and carried out. All of this will help ensure the property does not allow any access for rodents which may be in the area because of its location in relation to wetlands. There is no risk of fire in the property from rat damage as we have no evidence of rats existence inside the property.</p>
      <p>“I hope this reassures you that Westward has taken these reports seriously and is actively engaged in working to address Mrs Rowe’s concerns.”</p>
