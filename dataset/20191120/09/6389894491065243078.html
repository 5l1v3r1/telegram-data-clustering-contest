      <p>All Bar One owner Mitchells &amp; Butlers has toasted a rise in full-year profit as rising appetite for its food and drinks offset fears of a slowdown in the casual dining sector.</p>
      <p>Shares in the firm jumped seven per cent in early morning trading.</p>

      <p>The group, which owns chains including Toby Carvery, Harvester and All Bar One, posted adjusted operating profit of £317m in the 12 months to 28 September, rising from £303m in the same period a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Revenue jumped from £2.15bn to £2.23bn, with boss Phil Urban hailing “an improvement in like-for-like sales growth across the portfolio during the year”.</p>
      <p>With more than 1,700 sites across its pub and restaurant estate, Mitchells &amp; Butlers has faced rising costs from business rates and higher wages in recent months.</p>

      <p>Total sales rose almost four per cent, while like-for-like sales climbed 1.4 per cent during the first seven weeks of the new financial year.</p>
      <p>The rise in profit comes against a backdrop of concerns over the future of major retailers in the casual dining sector, many of which have closed outlets or cut costs in the wake of tougher trading conditions.</p>
      <p>Jamie’s Italian, Gaucho and Gourmet Burger Kitchen have been among the dining groups to announce closures or embark on a controversial insolvency restructuring in the last year.</p>
