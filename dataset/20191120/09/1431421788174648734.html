      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:31:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968833" target="_blank">Haaretz</a></address>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is reportedly looking to resign and run for a Senate seat in Kansas in the 2020 elections, according to GOP sources. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://time.com/5732232/mike-pompeo-kansas-senate-run-state-exit/">report in Time</a> says the secretary of state, who previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives from Kansas, had  planned to resign in the spring of next year, but is now looking to leave his post sooner as the impeachment inquiry heats up. The report also notes that Pompeo’s relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump has caused him to revise his timing. </p>
      <p>Trump had publicly criticized Pompeo for hiring William Taylor, who took a star turn as a witness in the first public impeachment hearings, as the U.S. replacement for the ousted Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>Time notes that “rumors of a Pompeo Senate campaign have circulated for months” and that Trump’s recent complaints about Pompeo not reining in State Department officials from participating in the impeachment inquiry have possibility fueled those rumors further. </p>
      <p>Pompeo has come under heavy criticism for his leadership at the State Department, particularly for not defending U.S. diplomats abroad and for allowing Yovanovitch to be unceremoniously removed for her post. Chuck Rosenberg, a veteran of the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations, slammed Pompeo last Friday on cable news, saying, “His silence is deafening, it is an act of abject cowardice. I’m astonished that somebody who went to West Point and was an Army officer does not have the spine to stand up for the people in his organization who are being denigrated by this President.”</p>
      <p>Rosenberg argued that Pompeo’s silence is a “complete failure of leadership” and “disgusting." Rosenberg concluded that if he could speak to Pompeo, “I would tell him he’s a coward.”</p>
