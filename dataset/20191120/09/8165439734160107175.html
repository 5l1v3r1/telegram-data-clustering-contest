      <p>The trailer sees a young boy woken up by a loud crashing noise in his home.</p>
      <p>Presumably his sibling, appears at his bedroom door and asks, "Did you hear that too?"</p>
      <p>They walk downstairs with a flashlight only to find a murderous creature feeding on something.</p>

      <p>The scene skips to a clip of three men in a garage.</p>
      <p>Their attention turns to a broadcaster on the TV reporting a series of vampire attacks in the country.</p>
      <p>We're then shown a clip of Ian Somerhalder's character Dr. Luther Swann emerging from his car.</p>

      <p>The authorities ask the doctor for help, "We need you doctor. All the victims have been missing a lot of blood."</p>
      <p>Ian's character addresses an audience, "This is modified, a virus causing DNA transformations."</p>
      <p>Swann soon discovers that his best friend Michael has been turned into one of these murderous predators.</p>

      <p>However, the authorities warn him to stay away, "The man you knew is gone."</p>
      <p>We're later shown a clip of Michael addressing the country in a live broadcast.</p>
