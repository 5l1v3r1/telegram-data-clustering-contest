      <p>Park your cars responsibly and avoid blocking the road or restricting access. Emergency vehicles need easy access at all times to the moorland communities.</p>
      <p>• Do not attempt to drive down narrow moorland roads that have not been gritted. You will get stuck, either on the road or in the ditch.</p>
      <p>• Do not attempt to drive down village side streets that have not been gritted. You may cause an accident.</p>
      <p>• Do not enter any fields with livestock.</p>
      <p>• Keep close control of dogs. Farmers are entitled to shoot any dog worrying sheep, especially around lambing time.</p>
      <p>• Respect private property. Not everywhere on the moor is access land. Check on the <a href="http://www.openaccess.naturalengland.org.uk/">Right to Roam website</a> whether land has public access</p>
      <p>• Leave gates and property as you find them. Farmers will normally shut gates to keep animals in, but may sometimes leave them open so the animals can reach food and water.</p>
      <p>• Use gates only and do not climb over dry stone walls or fences. These are easily damaged, allowing farm animals to escape.</p>
      <p>• If you are asked to leave private property by the land owner, Dartmoor National Park Ranger or the Police, please comply with the request politely and quickly. Do not resort to verbal or physical abuse.</p>
      <p>• Follow the Countryside Code at all times. Respect. Protect. Enjoy. Cllr Gregg Manning, Co-Chair of Dartmoor Forest Parish Council said, “Everyone understands that families want to enjoy the snow, and by following these few simple rules we can avoid some of the problems the local community has faced in the past”.</p>
