      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lady-colin-campbell/">Lady Colin Campbell</a> has been dropped from a Christmas lights job following her comments about paedophilia.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old socialite was meant to switch on the Christmas lights in Tetbury in Gloucestershire – not far from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a>’ Highgrove House estate – on 6 December.</p>
      <p>However, following <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lady-colin-campbell-makes-horrific-claims-underage-sex-workers-doesnt-count-paedophilia-11173594/">her comments about Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein on Good Morning Britain</a> this week, Lady C has been dropped and replaced by the Town Mayor.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! star had claimed that soliciting sex from minors was ‘not the same as paedophilia’.</p>

      <p>A statement from Tetbury Town Council’s clerk Stephen Holley read: ‘The Town Council has been advised by the organisers of the Christmas Lights Switch on Event that, in view of the recent controversy, they have decided to ask the Mayor to turn on the Christmas Lights, with a pupil from St Mary’s Primary School.’</p>

      <p>Lady C appeared on Good Morning Britain on Monday to discuss Prince Andrew’s Newsnight interview and the royal’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who died in his jail cell in August.</p>
      <p>Speaking directly about Epstein and his convictions, Lady C defended the Prince’s friendship with the convicted sex offender, who served nearly 13 months in custody after pleading guilty to procuring and soliciting a person under 18 for prostitution.</p>

      <p>He was convicted of these two crimes in a widely criticised plea deal, while federal officials had reportedly identified 36 girls who had been abused by Epstein, some of which were as young as 14.</p>
      <p>Before his suicide in August this year, Epstein was arrested in July on federal charges for sex trafficking of minors in New York and Florida.</p>
      <p>During her appearance on Monday, Lady Colin Campbell declared: ‘You all seem to have forgotten that Jeffrey Epstein, the offence for which he was charged and for which he was imprisoned, was for soliciting prostitution from minors.</p>
      <p>‘That is not the same thing as paedophilia.’</p>
      <p>A stunned Piers Morgan then asked what it was then, to which she simply answered: ‘Prostitution.’</p>
      <p>‘If you solicited a 14-year-old for prostitution, you’re a paedophile,’ Piers hit back.</p>
      <p>‘It doesn’t matter,’ Lady Campbell responded, with the reality star later saying that while she wasn’t justifying Epstein’s crimes, ‘I suspect there’s a difference between a minor and a child.’</p>
