      <h1>System76 Will Start Designing and Building Its Own Linux Laptops Beginning January 2020</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Forbes: <i>Denver-based PC manufacturer and Pop!_OS Linux developer System76 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/11/20/system76-will-start-designing-and-building-its-own-linux-laptops-beginning-january-2020/#735609b43e16">plans to follow-up its custom Thelio desktop PC with an in-house laptop beginning next year</a>, according to founder and CEO Carl Richell. During a recent interview, Richell was quick to emphasize that the entire process of designing, prototyping and iterating the final product could take two to three years. But the company is eager to break into this market and put the same signature "stamp" on its laptop hardware that graces <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/18/11/01/1518251/system76-thelio-computer-is-open-source-linux-powered-and-made-in-the-usa">its custom-built Thelio desktop</a>. <br/><br/>System76 sells an extensive lineup of laptops, but the machines are designed by the likes of Sager and Clevo. The company doesn't merely buy a chassis and slap Pop!_OS on it, but Richell tells me he's confident that with the experience gained from developing Thelio -- and the recent investment into a factory at the company's Denver headquarters -- System76 is capable of building a laptop from the ground up that meets market needs and carries a unique value proposition. Richell says the company's first priority is locking down the aesthetic of the laptop and how various materials look and feel. It will simultaneously begin working on the supply chain aspects and speaking with various display and component manufacturers. System76 will design and build a U-class laptop first (basically an Ultrabook form factor like the existing Darter and Galago) and then evaluate what it might do with higher-end gaming and workstation notebooks with dedicated graphics.</i></p>
