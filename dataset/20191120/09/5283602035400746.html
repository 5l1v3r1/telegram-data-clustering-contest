      <p>After BSNL, state-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) on Wednesday said its VRS plan has surpassed its internal estimates as more than 13,500 employees have opted for the recently-announced scheme so far.</p>
      <p>MTNL had initially expected 13,500 employees to opt for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), but the numbers have already reached 13,532 employees, with nearly two weeks left to go before the closing date for exercising the option.</p>
      <p>“We have received a strong response; and so far, as many as 13,532 employees have opted for the VRS scheme. Our internal target had been 13,500,” MTNL Chairman and Managing Director Sunil Kumar told <i>PTI</i>. He promised that the corporation will try to accommodate as many employees as possible. “We expect the numbers to reach the range of 14,500 to 15,000 by the closing date,” he said adding that, in all, 16,300 employees are eligible for the scheme.</p>
      <p>In case of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), as many as 77,000 employees of state-owned telecom corporation have opted for the recently launched VRS until now.</p>

      <p>The government has approved a plum ₹69,000-crore revival package for BSNL and MTNL that includes merging the two loss-making firms, monetising their assets and giving VRS to employees so that the combined entity turns profitable in two years.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet has approved the plan to combine MTNL - which provides services in Mumbai and New Delhi - with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) that services the rest of the nation.</p>
