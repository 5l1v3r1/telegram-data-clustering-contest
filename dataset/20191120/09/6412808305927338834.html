      <h4>There are currently 8,000 vacancies in the Royal Malaysia Police (PDRM), which is expected to be filled within the next three to four years</h4>
      <p>Bukit Aman management director Datuk Abdul Rahim Jaafar made the announcement after officiating the Pingat Jasa Pahlawan Negara (PJPN) award ceremony for police retirees, senior officers, and other employees at Dewan Merdeka yesterday, 19 November.<br/><br/>At the event, 300 retirees and 150 serving personnel received their medals, which are tokens for their bravery, sacrifice, and service to the nation, according toÂ <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2019/04/19/19000-cops-yet-to-receive-medals-due-to-constraints">The Star</a>.</p>

      <h4>The vacancies are the result of 3,000 to 4,000 retirees leaving the force every year, either optionally or by mandatory retirement age</h4>
      <p>"For next year, we project the recruitment of about 6,000 members including 500 officers," said Abdul Rahim, as quoted by <a href="http://www.bernama.com/en/general/news.php?id=1791292">Bernama</a>.</p>

      <h4>While PDRM now has about 128,000 officers, Abdul Rahim hoped the government would consider increasing its number of staff</h4>
      <p>"We hope to be exempted from the government policy of recruitment freeze.<br/><br/>"Not only to increase the members of the 69 Commando (VAT69) and Special Action Unit (UTK) but also the Integrity and Standards Compliance Department (JIPS) and other branches," he said.<br/><br/>In September, Bukit Aman headquarters had already called on the government to give special consideration to increase the number of members for the special forces VAT69 and UTK as they progressively need to deal with threats, especially on the <a href="https://says.com/my/news/malaysia-is-now-a-high-risk-country-for-kidnapping-according-to-us-state-department">east coast of Sabah</a>.</p>
