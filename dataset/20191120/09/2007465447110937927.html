      <h1>Someone reimagined the Delorean DMC 12 and we love it</h1>
      <h2>This is how Back To The Future's Delorean looks as a 21st century coupe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:35:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>October 21, 2015 â€“ the day that Marty McFly and Doc Brown went forward in time in the cult classic 'Back To The Future 2'.</p>
      <p>Now it's November 20, 2019, and we have yet to see hover boards that defy gravity, as well as an all-new Delorean that can actually fly and travel through time. But that hasn't stopped avid fans from reimagining the DMC into a modern cruiser.</p>

      <p>Recently, digital artist 'thiagod3design' rendered what the DMC Delorean could look like in 2019, and quite frankly it looks sick (in a good way that is). Painted in shiny black paint and sitting low to the ground, this particular Delorean looks more like it is ready for a Stance meetup. With its flared wheel arches, low-profile tires, and dropped ride height, this blacked-out hit from the 80s looks lean and mean.</p>
      <p>The signature dual headlight design has been brought to the digital age thanks to the addition of what appear to be daytime running lights (DRLs). While some may find this an unnecessary upgrade, I'm actually quite fond of it since most cars nowadays do come with DRLs as standard. Hidden behind those alloy wheels, on the other hand, are massive disc brakes which can help give the Delorean better braking.</p>

      <p>It's not all about looking good, though. Seen through the back window, this 'modern' Delorean gets a roll cage inside. While it does give the coupe a more 'aftermarket' look, it does not look too out of place on the Delorean. A pair of exhausts, along with a distinct body kit give the Delorean a sporty yet functional appearance.</p>

      <p>Would the late John Delorean, as well as Marty McFly and Doc Brown approve of this? Personally it does look wicked, but I wish it had a little bit more ground clearance as it might scrape the curb more than actually cruise the streets or go back to the future.</p>
