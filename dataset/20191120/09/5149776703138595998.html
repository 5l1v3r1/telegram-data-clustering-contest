      <h1>'Dangerous' - Bristol City coach issues warning ahead of facing Nottingham Forest</h1>
      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's Reds make the trip to Ashton Gate on Saturday after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:02:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:02</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City have been warned they must be “on their guard” against a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> side full of attacking threat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a>’s Reds return to action from the international break on Saturday when they make the trip to Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>The two teams are level on points in the Championship table, with Forest just above their next opponents, in fifth place, on goal difference.</p>
      <p>And Robins assistant head coach Dean Holden has praised the job Lamouchi has done at the City Ground - the Frenchman having overseen a fine start to the season since taking charge in the summer, in his first experience of English football.</p>
      <p>“You’d have to say that up to now, he’s doing a very good job,” <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-transcript-nottingham-forest-3555566">Holden told Bristol Live.</a> “They’ve had a turnaround of managers in the last few years.</p>
      <p>“It was such a huge football club when I was growing up; massive football club.</p>
      <p>“They seem at the moment like they’re in a good place.</p>

      <p>“They’re one place above us in the league, obviously on the same amount of points, but they’ve had a good start to the season.</p>
      <p>“They’ve got some real attacking intent in those forward areas, certainly with (Lewis)<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/lewis-grabban"> Grabban</a>, who’s a proven goalscorer.</p>
      <p>“They’re a team that we can’t take lightly <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/great-story-bristol-city-injury-3555492">at the weekend.</a></p>
      <p>“But like any team, we’ve studied them hard in this enforced break we’ve had and we feel that we’re ready for them.”</p>
      <p>The Reds notched up back-to-back wins before the international break, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/normal-service-resumed-how-nottingham-3496887">triumphing at Luton Town</a> and at home to arch-rivals Derby County, as they bounced back from successive defeats.</p>
      <p>“It’s always a team effort,” Holden added. “I’ve watched them in the last few games. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">I watched the Derby game.</a></p>
      <p>“The strength in depth they’ve got across the squad and some real experience in there - they’ve got some young talent in there in (Ryan) Yates and Matty Cash.</p>
      <p>“(Joe) Lolley on his left foot is a dangerous player as well.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to be on our guard against them.”</p>
