      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 PC patch has more fixes for stuttering, unbinds core drain from framerate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:13:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:13</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Rockstar has acknowledged that Arthur’s cores in Red Dead Redemption 2 were indeed draining faster on PC, and fixed the issue in the latest patch.</p>
      <p><b>Red Dead Redemption 2</b> has received another important update on PC. As promised, the patch brings further stutter fixes for players using four-core and six-core CPUs alongside Nvidia GPUs.</p>
      <p>Those running into that problem are no longer required to add launch arguments, though there are new Nvidia drivers (441.34) they should download. Another major fix in this week’s patch is getting rid of the pesky mouse cursor, which would sometimes persist on screen when playing the Epic Games Store version.</p>
      <p>Rockstar has also fixed the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/red-dead-redemption-2-core-drain-faster-pc-high-framerate/">recently discovered problem</a> that the game ties Arthur’s core drain and weight loss to framerate, which players noted has caused them to drain much faster compared to console. It turns out, they were correct, and the issue even affected Red Dead Online.</p>
      <p>Finally, placing waypoints on the map should no longer be annoying, as the waypoints will now be added where your mouse is pointing. Read on below for the full set of patch notes.</p>
