      <p>The best young public speakers from across Mid Devon have wowed the judges at a competition.</p>
      <p>A Tiverton High School student has been voted best speaker at the English Speaking Union competition first heats.</p>
      <p>Daisy Main, who is in year ten at the school, was first of all the speakers to present and won overall best speaker for her “insightful and poignant” delivery on ‘Anxiety – nature or nurture’.</p>
      <p>The heat, held at Blundell’s Ondaatje Hall on Tuesday, November 5, also featured teams from Blundell’s and Torquay Girls’ Grammar School.</p>
      <p>Two other THS students, Matthew Baker (Chairperson) and Seth Abdey (Questioner) were expertly assigned to Torquay Girls’ Grammar School, also impressed the judges and the audience, especially when dealing with complex questions from the floor.</p>
      <p>Julliet Main, assistant headteacher at Tiverton High School, said: “The English Speaking Union was very encouraging of our entry and delighted that public speaking will continue to grow at the school.</p>
      <p>“In January we will be working with Blundell’s’ students in preparing for Spring Debating competitions. In the next few weeks, we will be encouraging other students to join the current team to develop further public speaking and debating groups here at the school.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Crediton Queen Elizabeth (QE) School’s Year 11 Student, Mia Hodge was awarded best speaker at the second heat.</p>
      <p>QE played host for the second heat for the Exeter area following the first heat at Blundell’s School.</p>
      <p>QE entered two teams who competed, very successfully, against a team from Uffculme Academy and a team from Isca School.</p>

      <p>Team one, comprising Nell Hodgson, Kiki Shaw and Florence Terry selected the topic “Public Schools Should Be Abolished” and team two, comprising Mia Hodge, Will Harrison and Maya Vaughan, chose the theme “CCTV is a Threat to our Freedom” to speak about.</p>
      <p>Judges Roger Tilbury, Sue Maunder and Stephen Lawson were full of praise for the skills shown by students and awarded Mia Hodge with Best Speaker and selected Mia’s team as one of two winning teams.</p>
      <p>Mia, along with her teammates Will Harrison and Maya Vaughan, will now compete against Uffculme and two teams from Torquay Girls Grammar, in the regional final held at Exeter Golf and Country Club in December.</p>
      <p>QE English teacher Caroline Wilson said: “This was the first time QE has participated in, and hosted, this event and the evening was a great success.</p>
