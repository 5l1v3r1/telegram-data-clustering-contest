      <p>The I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here camp just got a little bigger.</p>
      <p>Two additions have entered the Australian outback, and they're both soap stars.</p>
      <p>Coronation Street star Andrew Whyment and <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/ex-eastenders-minty-star-confirmed-secret-im-celeb-cast-member-343438"><i>EastEnders actor Cliff Parisi</i></a> have joined the show as latecomers, it was revealed on Tuesday night.</p>

      <p>Andy is best known for playing Kirk Sutherland on Coronation Street, and joined the soap in 2000.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cliff is best known for his role of Minty Peterson in EastEnders, which he played from 2002 to 2010.</p>
      <p>He's also starred in Hollyoaks as Walt, and has most recently been in Call the Midwife as Fred Buckle.</p>

      <p>The pair were previously rumoured to be entering the jungle, however neither appeared in the main line-up.</p>
      <p>They will be joining current campmates <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/caitlyn-jenner-says-being-trans-was-dirty-secret-family-343596"><i>Caitlyn Jenner</i></a>, Roman Kemp, Nadine Coyle, Ian Wright, Kate Garraway, James Haskell, Myles Stephenson, Jacqueline Jossa, Adele Roberts and Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>Although we're only into the first few days in camp, there is already some friction. Roman and Adele clashed in Tuesday's highlight show over a photo of Loose Women presenter Jane McDonald - if you can believe it.</p>
