      <p>A former Super Eagles striker, Odion Ighalo, has hailed his compatriot Victor Osimhen for his fine form with the team, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>He was largely unused as the Super Eagles finished third at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Osimhen has, however, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/18/ligue-1-super-eagles-star-pockets-player-of-month-award-in-france/">bagged nine goals for Lille in France in 17 games</a> as well as notching up four goals in four matches for the Super Eagles.</p>
      <p>The Lille striker struck twice and gave two assists as <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/17/nigeria-come-from-behind-to-maul-lesotho-4-2/">Nigeria claimed three points against Lesotho</a> in a 2021 AFCON qualifier.</p>
      <p>Also, he was on song for the West Africans as they <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/13/afcon-qualifiers-nigeria-defeat-benin-republic-2-1/">defeated the Benin Republic</a> in the opening game of the qualifier for Cameroon 2021.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the former U-17 World Cup winner’s form with Nigeria, Ighalo urged him to keep working hard.</p>
      <p>He noted that he had always encouraged Osimhen to be committed to his game and ready to give his best.</p>
      <p>“I always told him that he has everything it takes to lead this attack, but it all depends on him,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I told him he has to keep working hard, stay humble and always be ready to learn, and above all not to get carried away with success or hype but just to keep improving.”</p>
