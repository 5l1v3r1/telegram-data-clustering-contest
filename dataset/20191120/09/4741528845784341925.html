      <p>Foremost amongst the CSR initiatives The Exchange was lauded for was the launch of the Sustainability Disclosure Guidelines, which articulates the approach to integrating sustainability into an organisation’s activities alongside indicators that should be considered when providing annual disclosure on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. The NSE also introduced the <i>Facts Behind the Sustainability Report</i> platform, which was designed to further promote the adoption of ESG practices, reporting, and disclosure while encouraging responsible long-term approaches to investment across the Nigerian capital market.</p>
