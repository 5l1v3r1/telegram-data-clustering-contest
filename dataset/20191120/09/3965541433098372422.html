      <p>PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) — A Washington State University fraternity member died four hours before the first 911 call reported his condition on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>That’s according to the Whitman County Coroner’s Office, which is investigating the death of 19-year-old Sam Martinez of Bellevue.</p>
