      <h1>Harry Redknapp suggests Mauricio Pochettino could make surprise Arsenal switch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:45:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">Harry Redknapp has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show</a> (Wednesday, 7.40am) that Mauricio Pochettino could make a surprise switch across north London to Arsenal – after being sacked by Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was relieved of his duties at Tottenham on Tuesday evening after a dismal start to the 2019-20 campaign that saw Spurs win just three of their 12 Premier League matches. They sit in 14th place in England’s top tier.</p>
      <p>Just hours later on Wednesday morning, Tottenham announced the appointment of Jose Mourinho as the club’s new manager – with many Spurs fans disappointed that their club have brought in a defensive-minded manager.</p>
      <p>Former Tottenham manager Redknapp spoke candidly to TalkSPORT on Wednesday morning and expressed his dismay to see Pochettino go. He reckons that the Argentine could remain in north London, and replace Unai Emery at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">“There’s clubs in London that could do with a manager,” <a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">Redknapp said</a>. “Why wouldn’t he [go to Arsenal]? Arsenal fans would warm to him if he starts winning. Sol Campbell, George Graham, they went from Tottenham to Arsenal. It could happen, as long as he does the job. They’ll be looking at it, and thinking ‘could we?'”<br/></span>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Pochettino has too much class to join Arsenal</h3>
      <p>In the past, former Southampton and Espanyol manager Pochettino has made it clear in a press conference that should Daniel Levy ever sack him – he would never make the switch across north London to Arsenal.</p>
      <p>Arsenal could do a lot worse than hire Pochettino, but if the Gunners do look to pursue the sacked Spurs manager, they will surely be told that there is no chance he would even consider a move to The Emirates.</p>
