      <h1>Celcom offers in-flight data roaming with its weekly roaming pass</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:44:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>The next time you travel overseas, you can stay connected during and after your flight with Celcom roaming pass. The Celcom <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/05/13/celcom-roaming-3-day-pass/">7-day 3-in-1 roaming pass</a> will enable you to go online at over 35,000 feet in the sky via AeroMobile inflight roaming service.</p>
      <p>The roaming pass costs RM138 for 7 days and it comes with 3GB of data. The pass also offers unlimited outgoing and incoming calls, and SMS from Malaysia as well as the country you’re visiting. It is supported at 40 countries which include Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the USA.</p>

      <p>If you’re on an AeroMobile enabled flight, you can stay connected at no extra cost using the same Celcom roaming pass. Just turn off aeroplane mode when it is safe to do so, enable data roaming and select AeroMobile under network settings. Your usage in-flight will utilise the same 3GB quota from the roaming pass.</p>

      <p>AeroMobile is supported on over 20 airlines which include Malaysia Airlines, Malindo Air, Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Singapore Airlines and Turkish Airlines. You can find the list of supported airlines <a href="https://www.aeromobile.net/airlines/">here</a>. AeroMobile uses satellite connectivity and it is worth pointing out that it may not be available on all flights.</p>
      <p>Depending on airlines, some in-flight WiFi service could cost a hefty subscription fee and they often come with very limited quota. With the inclusion of AeroMobile, Celcom’s roaming pass could be an alternative way to stay connected during long-haul flights.</p>
