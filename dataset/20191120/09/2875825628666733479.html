      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino paid the price for letting his emotions get the better of him at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>The Argentinean was sacked from his position on Tuesday evening and must find a way to keep control if he is to become an elite manager in the future</h2>

      <p>Cast your mind back to May 8, 2019.</p>
      <p>It is something Tottenham fans must often do, with Lucas Moura's 96th minute winner in Amsterdam providing one of the most dramatic and emotional moments in living footballing memory.</p>
      <p>One of the abiding images of the night was Mauricio Pochettino crumbling into a heap on the pitch, then walking around it sobbing at full-time, with the magnitude of what he and his team had achieved almost proving too much for him to process.</p>
      <p>At the time it was a joy to watch, a rare showing of true release from a top level manager.</p>

      <p>But now, looking back, it feels like it was the beginning of the end of the Argentinean's time in north London.</p>
      <p>Because if he reacted like that after a win in the semis, one can imagine how poorly he reacted to Spurs' limp defeat to Liverpool in the final.</p>
      <p>There were reports that after the drab 2-0 loss Pochettino could barely bring himself to speak to his players, instead choosing to hide himself away, much like he did after the humiliating 5-1 loss to Newcastle at the end of the 2015-2016 season.</p>
      <p>Imagine the very greatest managers doing the same. Would Sir Alex Ferguson or Pep Guardiola have left their miserable players feeling so isolated?</p>
      <p>Of course they wouldn't.</p>
      <p>After the initial disappointment they would have been plotting and scheming for the season ahead, thinking of ways to ensure they would reach the final again and go one step better.</p>

      <p>Or how about Jurgen Klopp? Before June's showpiece event in Madrid the German was notorious for bottling it at the final hurdle, and it is easy to forget that he had lost three finals in major competitions with Liverpool before that eventual triumph over Spurs.</p>
      <p>Most onlookers seem to be in agreement that something changed at Tottenham following that painful night in Madrid, but while the players should be given their fair share of blame for their frankly pathetic showings so far this season, Pochettino must shoulder some of it too.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he lacked the strength and energy to rebuild and do it all over again following his heartbreak in June, but if that was the case he should have departed over the summer rather than forcing himself to soldier on.</p>
      <p>Throughout the whole of the start of the current campaign we did not seen the Pochettino we were accustomed to. The positivity and drive was gone, and replaced by dour, rambling press conferences where he appeared unable to even convince himself of what he was saying.</p>

      <p>Whether it is Bayern Munich, Real Madrid or PSG, Pochettino will get a job at an elite club sooner rather than later, and during his time at that club there will undoubtedly be highs and lows.</p>
      <p>If Pochettino is to reach the top bracket of managers, he must find a ruthless streak which enables him to take the ups with the downs without over-reaction.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the biggest game of his life in Madrid he revealed his mother described him as a 'llorona'- literally somebody who cries a lot. He also said if they beat Liverpool he would spend 'One week crying'.</p>
      <p>The tears may be flowing as he walks away from Spurs for the final time, but once they have dried Pochettino will need to find a steely inner self to recover from this blow.</p>
