      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Ubisoft has unveiled a five-day crossover event with Netflix's Money Heist in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.</li>
        <li>The limited-time mode serves up 24/7 Hostage on Bank, accompanied by themed skins.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ubisoft has unveiled as crossover event headed to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>, tying into the Netflix-hosted crime drama, La Casa De Papel, better known as Money Heist. The first branded event hosts a limited-time playlist of 24/7 Hostage on Bank, themed with exclusive cosmetics inspired by the TV show.</p>
      <p>The La Casa De Papel event is scheduled for November 20 to November 25, tying into a free weekend from November 21. The mode's red-suited hostage takes inspiration from the series' defining outfit, also available as permanent cosmetics for Hibana and Vigil. These paid packs will cost 1680 R6 Credits outside of the mode, inclusive of uniform, headgear, weapon skins, and charms.</p>
      <blockquote>Hibana's Heist Bundle contains the Red Jumpsuit uniform, Emboldened headgear, Tokyo charm, and Regal Mint weapon skin for the TYPE-89. Vigil's Accomplice Bundle includes the Red Jumpsuit uniform, Nameless headgear, The Surrealist charm, and Fresh Paper weapon skin for the K1A.</blockquote>
      <p>Unlike Rainbow Six Siege's full-fledged mid-season events, the Money Heist crossover is a smaller-scale mashup of the familiar Rainbow Six formula. That includes the same core gameplay of the Hostage mode, differentiated with a trio of new character skins. But that still shakes up the experience with a fresh twist, in a similar vein to Fortnite and its ongoing brand tie-ins. This comes after an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/352033/the-division-movie-coming-to-netflix">earlier deal with Netflix</a>, with work underway on a film adaptation of Tom Clancy's The Division, starring Jessica Chastain and Jake Gyllenhaal.</p>
      <p>Rainbow Six Siege is now available starting at $30 on Amazon, or free on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, over the weekend ahead.</p>
