      <h1>Nebula Nearly Wore the Infinity Gauntlet in Avengers: Endgame</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:11:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Gramuglia</a></address>
      <p>Plenty of early ideas were considered and then discarded during the development of Marvel's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/avengers-4"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a>, which not only resolved the cliffhanger of <i>Infinity War</i> but concluded the studio's entire Infinity Saga. Some never made it past the draft stage, while others were brought to life in concept art. Such is the case with Nebula, whose time-heist shenanigans resulted in the present-day version of the character meeting, and ultimately killing, her 2014 counterpart.</p>
      <p>However, an early plan for the 204 Nebula was significantly different: She would have used the recovered Infinity Stones in an attempt to impress Thanos, only to be destroyed in the process. But how does that compare to when Nebula wore the Gauntlet herself the 1991 Marvel Comics storyline <i>The Infinity Gauntlet</i>, which inspired <i>Infinity War</i> and<i> Endgame</i>?</p>

      <h3>Nebula's Demise</h3>

      <p>In <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, Nebula shoots her 2014 counterpart as an action of letting go of the past. This scene helps to develop Nebula, played by Karen Gillan, beyond where she began in 2014's <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>.</p>

      <p>According to the newly released <i>Art of Avengers: Endgame</i>, "While the Nebula from the past was killed by her future self in <i>Avengers: Endgame,</i> her demise was scripted a bit differently in another version. In that draft, she was able to intercept the Stark gauntlet in the film's final battle. Wanting to prove to her father Thanos that she is a capable and strong warrior, Nebula tries to use the glove herself -- a nod to the 1991 comic book series Infinity Gauntlet, written by Jim Starlin. This Nebula learns she is not powerful to use the Stones and survive."</p>

      <p>In that iteration, we would have never seen the emotional confrontation between the two Nebulas, which for some proved to be a capstone to her characterization. This death would have been flashier, but it might not have been as emotionally resonant as Nebula literally killing her past to save her future. Had she put on the Stark gauntlet, the focus of the scene would have been placed on the spectacle of Nebula burning up, rather than the emotions underlying the action.</p>

      <p>Of course, Tony Stark ultimately sacrificed his life in Endgame when he used the gauntlet Thanos and his army. With the final battle as clustered and busy it was, perhaps it's better Nebula didn't snatch the gauntlet herself, as it permitted other characters to have moments in the spotlight. Indeed, the Children of Thanos barely have their defeat highlighted in the final film, because fight primarily focused on the heroes.</p>
      <h3>The Original Infinity Gauntlet Story</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>While the scene would have been a nod to <i>The Infinity Gauntlet</i>, in which Nebula briefly wields the glove, there are a few key differences that set the two apart. In <i>The Infinity Gauntlet</i>, Thanos confronts the demon Mephisto, who betrays him, in a spiritual battle. While Thanos is distracted, the captive and tormented Nebula snatches the Gauntlet from him, and uses its power to restore herself to her full glory (Thanos had essentially burned her with the Gauntlet, leaving her close to death).</p>

      <p>Although the Gauntlet is powerful in the comic, it doesn't take the massive physical toll that it does in the film; anyone can wield it. With the Gauntlet, Nebula becomes the primary threat in the story's final act, requiring the combined effort of Thanos, Doctor Strange, the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock to defeat her. Thanos tricks Nebula into undoing the damage Thanos caused to reality, ironically resulting in the Mad Titan saving the universe.</p>

      <p>The day is saved when Adam Warlock, using his connection to the Soul Gem, causes the Infinity Gems (as they were called in the comics) to enter a state of discord. That results in Nebula experiencing pain agony -- much like what the 2014 version of her Marvel Cinematic Universe analog would have felt had she put on the Gauntlet. She removes the Gauntlet before it can kill her, and Adam Warlock steals it away.</p>
      <p>Thanos is forced to negotiate with Nebula. We learn, thanks to Adam Warlock and his connection to the Soul Gem, that Thanos always sort of wanted the Gauntlet to be stolen from him. He doesn't believe he deserves to wield such power, and his own self-sabotaging nature helped Nebula yp capture the Gauntlet. Ultimately, Nebula's success isn't because of her cunning, but, rather, Thanos' own weakness. The fight becomes almost a redemption arc for Thanos. That's further emphasized when, at the end, Nebula is arrested and tried as a pirate while Thanos, after "blowing himself up," retires to a farm.</p>
      <p>This iteration of Nebula is a proactive opponent of Thanos, akin to her present-day analog in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, rather than the heroic modern iteration, this version is a villain. Nebula gaining the Gauntlet serves to push Thanos into a state of redemption. Her actions service Thanos' story, as opposed to in the MCU, where her actions would have served her own development.</p>
