      <p>Schedule: The first round and quarterfinals are Friday, with the semifinals and championship matches on Saturday. If any of the three local schools reached their respective state finals, they are scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday. Consolation-bracket matches begin Friday and continue Saturday.</p>
