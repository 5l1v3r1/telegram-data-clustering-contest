      <p>It's no secret that an employee's manager has a very direct impact on their happiness at work. <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/linkedin-just-revealed-4-traits-of-really-bad-bosses-and-heres-how-to-fix-them.html">Great bosses tend to have happier employees than bad bosses do.</a> Today, job site LinkedIn revealed the results of its research into <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/6-proven-ways-to-work-with-a-bad-boss.html">exactly what bosses do that make their employees happy and want to stay.</a></p>
      <p>After reviewing a total of 32 million LinkedIn profiles, LinkedIn found that, after 12 months at a company, there's a 76 percent chance of an employee still being there. After two years, this number drops to just a 59 percent chance that the employee will still be there. And after three years? Only a 48 percent chance.</p>
      <p>LinkedIn took a closer look at its data to figure out why this is the case. Researchers found that great bosses do 3 very specific things to make their employees happy. <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/11-habits-of-remarkably-happy-people.html">And happy employees tend to stick around.</a> Here's what LinkedIn discovered in its research:</p>
      <h3>1. Employees who change positions internally stay way longer--even if they're not getting a promotion.</h3>
      <p>LinkedIn found that, after three years, someone who was promoted is 70 percent likely to be there, while someone who moved laterally has a 65 percent chance. In comparison, someone who is stuck in their same position--with no promotion and no lateral move--has only a 45 percent chance of still being at that company after three years. Great managers provide employees with opportunities to change positions internally--either as a promotion or a lateral move to a new function. According to LinkedIn's findings, their employees are happier and are much, <i>much</i> more likely to stick around than those who stay in the same role.</p>
      <h3>2. Great management matters: Companies with highly rated management saw better retention. </h3>
      <p>LinkedIn's research also revealed that companies rated highly for "open and effective management" experienced significantly greater retention. After three years, there was a 48 percent chance of employees still being at those companies. For businesses with low management scores, however, there was just a 32 percent chance of an employee lasting three years. <a href="https://www.ultimatesoftware.com/PR/Press-Release/New-National-Study-Conducted-by-Ultimate-Software-Reveals-Need-for-Greater-Focus-on-Manager-Employee-Relationships">One 2017 survey found that 56 percent of employees</a> would turn down a 10 percent pay raise to stay with a great boss. As the old saying goes, people don't quit their jobs, they quit their managers.</p>
      <h3>3. Empowered employees are loyal employees.</h3>
      <p>When LinkedIn cross-referenced its employee value propositions survey (things like "good work-life balance" or " a purposeful mission") with its retention data, it discovered that companies perceived to be places where "employees have influence"--who are empowered--had workers that tended to stick around longer. In fact, after three years, there's a 47 percent chance of an employee sticking with them. Compare this to companies that are seen as less-empowering, where employees have only a 35 percent of being there after three years. So, if you're a manager, be sure to empower your people <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-economy/delegation-is-an-art-and-here-are-9-simple-ways-to-do-it-better.html">by giving them the authority they need to get their jobs done.</a></p>
