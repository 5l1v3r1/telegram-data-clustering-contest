      </p>
      <p>While many people are still skeptical about 5G, Verizon continues their rollout plans. Today, the company flipped the switch for four new cities: Atlanta, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Washington DC. Verizon is already <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-5g-verizon-europe/">selling</a> a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/lg-v50-5g-verizon-launch/">couple</a> of 5G devices, but the list of available cities is still relatively small. So the continued expansion is good news.</p>
      <p>Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network is mmWave, just like AT&amp;T, but different from Sprint’s sub-6Ghz network. One of the limitations of mmWave is you have to be in very specific locations to get the advertised 5G speeds. For example, read the description for Indianapolis below.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Indianapolis:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Indianapolis, 5G Ultra Wideband service is initially available in parts of the following neighborhoods, Arsenal Heights, Bates Hendricks, Castleton, Crown Hill, Fountain Square, Grace Tuxedo Park, Hawthorne, Historic Meridian Park, Lockerbie Square, Ransom Place, Renaissance Place, St. Joseph Historic Neighborhood, Upper Canal and Woodruff Place and around such landmarks and public spaces as Garfield Park, and Indiana University School of Medicine.</p>
      <p>Even if you have a 5G device and live in these cities, you may not be in the covered areas. These four new cities bring Verizon’s list up to nine, but they are still planning to have 5G in more than 30 cities by 2020. Soon, they will add the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/verizon-samsung-galaxy-note-10-5g-more-5g-cities/">Galaxy Note 10 5G</a> to the list of capable devices as well. Whether the market is ready or not, Verizon marches on with 5G.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Washington DC:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Washington DC, consumers, businesses and government agencies can initially access Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service in areas of Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle, Cardozo / U Street, Adams Morgan, Columbia Heights, Le Droit Park, Georgetown Waterfront, Judiciary Square, Shaw, Eckington, NOMA, National Mall and the Smithsonian, Gallery Place / Chinatown, Mt. Vernon Square, Downtown, Penn Quarter, Brentwood, Southwest Waterfront, Navy Yard, and nearby Crystal City, VA, as well as around landmarks such as the Ronald Reagan National Airport, United States Botanical Gardens, Hart Senate Building, National Gallery of Art, Lafayette Square, The White House, Freedom Plaza, Farragut Square, George Washington University, Capital One Arena, Union Station, Howard University Hospital, George Washington University Hospital, and Georgetown Waterfront Park.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Atlanta:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Atlanta, 5G Ultra Wideband service will initially be concentrated in parts of the following neighborhoods: Downtown, Midtown, Tech Square, and around such landmarks as The Fox Theater, Emory University Hospital Midtown, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Home Depot Backyard, Centennial Olympic Park, Georgia Aquarium, World of Coca Cola, and parts of Renaissance Park.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Detroit:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Detroit, 5G Ultra Wideband service will initially be concentrated in parts of the following areas: Dearborn, Livonia, and Troy, including areas around the Oakland-Troy Airport.</p>

      <h3>Update 1: Phoenix Launch + Boingo Partnership</h3>
      <p>Verizon’s 5G coverage is coming to Phoenix, AZ, bringing the list of 5G cities up to 10. The network will go live on August 23rd. Verizon also announced a partnership with Boingo to bring 5G Ultra Wideband service to indoor and public places.</p>
      <p>This is important because Verizon’s current 5G network is essentially unusable indoors, a limitation of the technology they are using. The partnership should bring 5G to places like airports, stadiums, arenas, office buildings, hotels, etc.</p>
      <p>Last, but not least, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ 5G will be available from Verizon tomorrow, August 23rd. The full retail price is $1,299.99.</p>

      <h3>Update 2: NYC, Boise, Panama City</h3>
      <p>Verizon’s 5G coverage is expanding to 3 more cities: New York City, Boise, and Panama City. In New York City, coverage will be in areas of Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and around several landmarks. Verizon’s 5G technology limits coverage to very specific areas, so be sure to check the source below for all the exact locations you can access 5G in these cities.</p>

      <h3>Update 3: Omaha &amp; Dallas</h3>
      <p>Today, Verizon has expanded 5G coverage to two more cities: Omaha, Nebraska and Dallas, Texas. This brings the number of cities with 5G coverage from Verizon up to 15. As with the previous announcements, the actual coverage areas are extremely specific. So if you live in these cities, be sure to check the link below to find out where you can get 5G speeds.</p>

      <h3>Update 4: Boston, Houston, and Sioux Falls</h3>
      <p>Verizon has announced that its 5G network is now live in three more cities across the US: Boston, MA, Houston, TX, and Sioux Falls, SD. This brings the total number of cities with Verizon 5G coverage up to 18. Just like the previous 15 cities, 5G is only accessible in these cities in very specific locations due to limitations with Verizon’s network technology. Be sure to visit the link below to see the exact locations where you can use 5G.</p>

      <h3>Update 5: 5G Coverage Map</h3>
      <p>Verizon has been flipping the switch for 5G in US cities for months, but they’ve never really had detailed coverage maps. You can now <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/5g/coverage-map/">visit this page</a> on Verizon’s website and select a city to see the 5G coverage. Maps show where 5G Ultra Wideband is strongest and you can zoom in to see LTE coverage as well. Verizon’s 5G coverage is very specific, so these maps are handy if you’re looking to try it out. The website also lists 10 cities that will get 5G next: Cincinnati, Kansas City, Charlotte, Little Rock, Cleveland, Memphis, Columbus, Salt Lake City, Des Moines, and San Diego.</p>
