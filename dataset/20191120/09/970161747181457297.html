      <p>While it wouldn’t seem Jason Momoa would need any help channelling his inner metal head, the Game of Thrones star did turn to lead vocalist of rock troupe Archspire Oliver Rae Alerton – aka Oli Peters – for Baba Voss’ war cry in Apple TV+ epic, SEE.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old – who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emilia-clarke-told-disappoint-game-thrones-fans-didnt-nude-scenes-11181547/">comforted Emilia Clarke through her Game of Thrones sex scenes</a> – is a notorious head banger, regularly sharing photos backstage from metal gigs and posing with his rock heroes on Instagram. No surprise then he was determined to nail Baba’s chant, even if he’s proved capabilities time and time again before.</p>
      <p>If you haven’t manage to catch SEE – do. The fantasy follows Momoa’s hero leading a wild community 400 years into the future after the world has been exterminated with the exception of 2 million humans who emerged without their sight. Not only that, sight has even become heresy, which proves problematic when the children Baba is raising that have been fathered to another man are born with the ability to SEE.</p>

      <p>Oli has now revealed how he helped the Aquaman actor on set.</p>

      <p>‘Jason has such an interest in music and has done aggressive acting scenes before, so he was a quick learner for this,’ Oli spilled to Metal Insider. ‘We spent time getting him familiar with what the vocal style is and were messaging back and forth while Archspire was on tour.</p>
      <p>‘When we hung out on sets, in between takes I’d come over to him and we’d go over the lines together.’</p>
      <p>Momoa may be a fierce warrior in SEE, but he’s a hoot on set.</p>
      <p>‘Already having the background experience of being in front of cameras while playing and having to have high energy during go time helped us out with being on screen,’ Oli continued. ‘Being on a big-budget TV set was a trip, and Jason putting us in speaks to the creative side of what he does. He has this crazy reputation and status, but he’s just a fun metal dude.’</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk caught up with Momoa, who told us he felt like he was finally get the role her deserved after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/jason-momoa-felt-cheated-by-khal-drogo-death-in-game-of-thrones-and-rightly-so-11018289/">being ‘cheated’ by Game of Thrones</a>. He also dropped some big spoilers for season two…</p>
