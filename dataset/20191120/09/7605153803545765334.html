        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 20 – The National Treasury has issued a ten-day notice to 15 counties which have failed to clear pending bills in line with a presidential directive.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement on Tuesday, Acting Cabinet Secretary Ukur Yatani said that the said counties have persistently failed to pay for goods and services provided by firms in the private sector including small and Micro enterprises.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Yatani stated that as a result, effective December 1 the transfers for the 2019/2010 financial year and the transfer of conditional grants will be stopped.</p>
      <p>“With regard to the County Governments, a special audit by the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) sometime in the 2018 verified and approved payments of an amount of Sh51.2 billion out of a total Sh88.98 billion pending bills presented for audit, while a total of Sh37.7 billion were to be reviewed further subject to production of full documentation in support of the claim,” he stated.</p>
      <p>He further said that appropriate measures will be taken to ensure the counties make prompt payments.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to note that these pending bills were for the period after the roll-out of the devolved system of government and therefore do not include pending bills accumulated by the defunct local authorities,” Yatani pointed out.</p>
      <p>The CS revealed that among the counties blacklisted include Nairobi, Machakos, Narok, Vihiga, Isiolo, Tana River, Migori, Tharaka Nithi and Bomet.</p>
      <p>He stated that others are Kirinyaga, Nandi, Mombasa, Kiambu, Garissa and Baringo.</p>
      <p>“The mechanisms for verification of the latter were handled/processed on a transitional basis by the Devolved Governments and the Intergovernmental Relations Technical Committee (IGRTC),” he said.</p>
      <p>Yatani recalled that National Treasury’s repeatedly re-enforced its directives that all genuine pending bills without any audit query and appropriately supported by documentation be paid by end of the financial year 2018/19 without fail.</p>
      <p>He stated that following this, Sh65 billion was released to County Governments by 30th June 2019, which was indeed the final disbursement on the understanding that this will be 4 utilized to pay off all pending bills.</p>
      <p>“Further, In the current financial year 2019/20, the National Treasury has to-date released the full amounts of equitable share of revenue due to counties for the period ending 31st October 2019,” he said.</p>
      <p>Yatani stated that there are twelve counties have so far complied with the directive and cleared their eligible bills.</p>
      <p>He outlined these as Elgeyo Marakwet, Homabay, Kajiado, Kericho, Kilifi, Kwale, Laikipia, Makueni, Nyamira, Nyandarua, Nyeri and Uasin Gishu.</p>
      <p>The CS pointed out that a further 20 counties have demonstrated some efforts towards payments of their pending bills.</p>
