        <li>A mile-long road in London has been the city’s “Billionaires Row” since World War II: a destination for luxury, scandal, murder, and secrecy.</li>
        <li>66 The Bishops Avenue in 1985 became the scene of one of London’s most famous unsolved murders.</li>
        <li>Fashion tycoon Aristos Constantinou was shot with six bullets – four to the body, two to the head – in the family chapel.</li>
        <li>The case has become one of the most popular topics on Reddit’s r/UnsolvedMysteries thread.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/inside-london-billionaires-row-property-interactive-2019-11">This post is</a> <a href="https://www.insider.com/inside-london-billionaires-row-property-interactive-2019-11">part of an interactive series by Insider profiling Billionaires Row</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Heath Lodge lies at the southern tip of The Bishops Avenue.</p>
      <p>It is the last of 66 mansions on a street famed for excess and decay, where many homes lies empty and dilapidated, yet still accruing value in London’s burgeoning property market.</p>
      <p>The seven-bedroom house, built in 1976, is dwarfed by its neighbors. But it played host to one of London’s most high-profile unsolved crimes, which has continued to fascinate more than 30 years on.</p>
      <p>In the mid 1980s, the house was owned by rags-to-riches Cypriot fashion entrepreneur Aristos Constantinou.</p>

      <p>Constantinou moved in next to fabulously wealthy neighbors, including Iranian and Brunei royalty.</p>
      <p>He paid £400,000 for Heath Lodge -which would be worth around £2.5 million ($3.2 million) today – and lived there with his wife Elena and their three children.</p>
      <p>The businessman made his millions through the fashion brand Ariella, which he founded with his brother Achilleas in 1966.</p>

      <p>The Constantinou couple, in their maroon Range Rover, were returning from a New Year’s Eve party as 1984 became 1985. Constantinou was 40 and his wife was 36, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/fraud-police-investigates-son-of-the-tycoon-killed-by-a-silver-bullet-10134595.html">The Independent reported</a>.</p>
      <p>That night, in the early hours of January 1, while kneeling at prayer inside his private chapel, Constantinou was hit with six bullets – four to the body, two to the head – from a .25 handgun, <a href="https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/crime-court/police-to-conduct-review-into-notorious-silver-bullets-murder-1-4837495">The Ham &amp; High local newspaper reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The newspaper said the bullets were made by the Italian manufacturer Fiocchi, and colored silver. None have been manufactured since 1961.</p>

      <p>The circumstances of the murder were also mysterious.</p>
      <p>The couple got home at 1 a.m., Elena told London’s Metropolitan Police, and were ambushed by two black-clad burglars in carnival masks, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3537015/Family-of-murdered-tycoon-calls-for-charges-against-widow.html">The Telegraph</a> and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-427506/Why-Elena-widow-prime-suspect-Silver-Bullet-case.html">Daily Mail</a> reported.</p>
      <p>They locked her in a bathroom, Elena told police, but she got away through an open window, clambering down the drainpipe. In the meantime her husband was taken away and shot.</p>
      <p>The police were not convinced by Elena’s story, the Daily Mail reported.</p>

      <p>Officers found only old fingerprints, and no smudge marks from gloves found near the emptied safe, which had once contained £50,000 ($75,000) in foreign currency but was found empty.</p>
      <p>A pathologist, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/silver-bullet-murder-case-reopened-ss5gdtjms">The Sunday Times reported</a>, noted that the gun used to kill Constantinou was under four inches in length, uncommon for such a burglary.</p>
      <p>Decades on, the murder is still good for business, estate agent Trevor Abrahmsohn, who sold the property soon after the murder, told Insider.</p>
      <p>“We sold the place with a silver bullet embedded in the wall,” he said.</p>

      <p>In the years since, Constantinou’s story has attracted vast attention from the amateur investigators of the Reddit discussion board <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/9psptr/the_unresolved_silver_bullet_murder_on/">r/UnresolvedMysteries</a>.</p>
      <p>Theories include that he was killed in a business dispute, given his brand was flying high, or that he was the victim of a robbery gone wrong, owning to gloves found at the scene.</p>
      <p>Several Redditors have placed the blame on Elena and ask why the burglars or assassins would leave her alive.</p>
      <p>Others feel, even if Elena was guilty, the details are too confused and the case dragged on too long for it to be labeled the “perfect crime.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police told Insider that officers remain committed to one day finding the perpetrator who “brutally murdered” Constantinou.</p>
