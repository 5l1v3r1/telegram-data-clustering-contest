      <h1>Tottenham name Mourinho as new boss after Pochettino sacked by club</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:14:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:14</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been appointed the new manager of English football club Tottenham Hotspur, following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Portuguese won three Premier League titles with Chelsea, and also managed Manchester United. He returns to management for the first time since being sacked by Manchester United in December.</p>
      <p>Tottenham announced Mourinho would be their new manager on a contract running until the end of the 2022-23 season.</p>
      <p>Spurs Chairman Daniel Levy said in a statement: "In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>“He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Despite taking the club to their first Champions League final last season, Pochettino was fired after a poor run of form in 2019, which saw the team winning just six of their last 24 league games.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” Mourinho said. “The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
