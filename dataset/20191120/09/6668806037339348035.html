      <p>Talking about the film, director Aditya Dhar said, "Ashwatthama is one of the most powerful and mysterious characters from the Mahabharata. Being Drona’s son, he is a brilliant warrior but also arrogant and egoistic because he is immortal. In comparison to other warriors like Arjuna and Karna, not much is written about him in various versions of the Mahabharata."<br/><br/>Moving on to Vicky Kaushal's look in the movie, director Aditya Dhar stated, "Like Uri, Vicky has to gain an incredible amount of weight, but this time, he will also have to lose it all during the course of the filming. His look will come as a complete surprise." Well, we can't wait for this hit duo to create magic again, what about you?</p>
