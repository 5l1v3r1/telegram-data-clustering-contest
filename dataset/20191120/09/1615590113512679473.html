      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:50:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1708" target="_blank">Haydn Taylor</a></address>
      <p>After four years, Viveport president Rikard Steiber has announced his departure from the company.</p>
      <p>Since joining in 2016, Steiber has overseen development of Viveport, the subscription-based platform which includes titles for both Rift and Vive hardware.</p>
      <p>The news comes less than two months after former Orange executive Yves Maitre was appointed CEO of Viveport.</p>
      <p>"Viveport Infinity is having incredible positive momentum with new top rated content, great product and new subscriber records daily," Steiber told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2019/11/18/breaking-rikart-steiber-departs-htc/#6617cb5a7236">Forbes</a> in an email.</p>
      <p>"However, as HTC now is entering a new chapter, I have agreed with Yves that it is a great time for me to move on and take on a new challenge after almost four years at HTC Vive."</p>
      <p>Steiber is now on garden leave until his contract expires in the new year. Before joining Viveport he was global marketing director for Google, and CEO of media company MTGx.</p>
