      <p>Enjoy continental cuisine in Bideford thanks to a new restaurant; Le Petit Monde.</p>
      <p>The new venture has been opened by Lydia Crouch and chef Florian Bourcereau, on Cooper Street. The couple visited Bideford and fell in love with the town and its people, so decided to set up a business and a home. </p>
      <p>Lydia said: “Our approach is to provide adventurous food, cooked in a vibrant and interesting way, with the amazing local produce from the area at the heart of the offering.</p>
      <p>“The vibe is quirky and relaxed, encouraging fluid dining - drop by for a couple of small plates and a drink with friends, or stay for a longer time and explore the menu in more depth - either is fine with us.</p>

      <p>“In France, ‘Le Petit Monde’ is a term you use to refer to your circle of friends, people that come together to enjoy and share. So, we want local people and visitors to Bideford alike to become part of our petit monde, and enjoy unique tastes with us.”</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes, Florian will be serving dishes for lunch and dinner every day.</p>

      <p>He added: “I am originally from the South of France and learned my craft in the family’s seafood business. </p>
      <p>“I’ve since travelled all around the world, exploring different cuisines. I then met Lydia, who ran the front of house on a tropical island on the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
      <p>“Since then I’ve worked in various London restaurants, for example, designing menus for a noted gastropub in the Chislehurst area, and for Androuet, a specialist in French wine and cheese in the heart of vibrant Spitalfields market.”</p>
