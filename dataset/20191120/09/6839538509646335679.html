      <p>A vegan has sued US fast food chain Burger King for allegedly misleading customers by cooking vegetable-based patties for their ‘Impossible Whoppers’ on the same grill as their meat products.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit was filed by a self-proclaimed vegan in a U.S District Court in Florida and aims to become a class-action.</p>
      <p>According to the suit, the man ordered the burger at an Atlanta drive-through and was shocked to find out the plant-based patty was grilled on the same surface as traditional meat burgers - meaning they were potentially contaminated with ‘meat byproducts.’</p>
      <p>While Burger King’s ‘Impossible Burgers’ are described as “100% Whopper, 0% Beef”, the website also states “for guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-brioler method of preparation is available on request.”</p>
      <p>The news sparked a debate about vegan options in fast food restaurants.</p>
