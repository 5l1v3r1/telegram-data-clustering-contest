        <b>Robbie Williams <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/20/robbie-williams-wants-put-stop-michael-buble-owning-christmas-must-end-now-10950583/">threatened to end Michael Buble’s festive reign</a> but he has a contender in Coldplay, with both set to race for the all important Christmas number one.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week will see Robbie, 45, release his first ever Christmas album The Christmas Present, while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/coldplay-surprise-welsh-locals-revealing-everyday-life-album-tracklist-newspaper-listing-10973662/">Coldplay are also dropping their anticipated new album Everyday Life</a> on Friday.</p>
      <p>Both releases come one month before Christmas meaning they’ll have to hold onto the top spot for four weeks, but sources say they’re expected to enjoy big sales.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10380679/robbie-williams-coldplay-war-christmas-no1/">source told The Sun</a>: ‘Coldplay and Robbie are both massive forces when it comes to selling albums so the numbers they will shift next week will be huge.</p>
      <p>‘They have strong track records and very dedicated fan bases who will fight for their act to get to number one.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘At the moment Coldplay are looking likely to pip him to the post, but with a week and a half to go it’s anyone’s game, especially given all of the publicity Robbie has done.’</p>

      <p>Robbie has certainly ramped up the promotion for The Christmas Present, including a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/prince-william-finds-robbie-williams-hilarious-joke-around-royal-variety-show-11180368/">performance at the Royal Variety Performance this week</a> which saw him duet with Rod Stewart and Jamie Cullum.</p>

      <p>The show is set to air on ITV in December which could likely give Robbie’s record sales a nice boost in time for the Christmas number one announcement.</p>
      <p>It was also announced this week that the former Take That star will return to Las Vegas next year for eight shows.</p>

      <p>Sharing the exciting news of his new residency, Robbie said: ‘I’m so excited to be returning to Las Vegas for new residency dates next year.</p>
      <p>‘To have my own run of Vegas shows was a real dream come true and I can’t wait to come back.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Coldplay have put themselves to work this week by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/coldplay-performing-natural-history-museum-celebrate-new-album-fans-cant-cope-11179556/">announcing a surprise show at London’s Natural History Museum</a>, which will take place next Monday.</p>
