      <p>In recent times, Bale's future with Los Blancos has been called into question after the 30-year-old fell out of favour with manager Zinedine Zidane and the club's fans. </p>
      <p>Despite playing a starring role during his time in Madrid, the former Tottenham Hotspur forward has been widely criticized for his frequent golf days and his reluctance to learn Spanish, as well as the amount of time he spends in the injury room. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Bale was linked with a transfer to an unnamed Chinese club during the previous transfer window but the deal collapsed following Real's injury crisis, and the Wales international now appears to be doing all in his power to force a move away. </p>
      <p>Following his nation's 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday night, Bale was photographed smiling while holding a Welsh flag with the words "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order.".</p>

      <p>According to the <i>Mirror</i>, the act has not gone down well with Real officials and fans and it is believed that the latest controversy will be the final nail in Welshman's Real coffin. </p>

      <p>Bale joined the record 33-time LaLiga champions in 2013 and has gone on to score 104 goals in 238 appearances for the club, including three goals across his side's four most recent UEFA Champions League final triumphs. </p>
