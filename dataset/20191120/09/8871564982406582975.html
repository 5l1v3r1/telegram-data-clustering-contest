      <h1>Singapore police arrest e-scooter for high-wire stunt ride</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:32:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>An e-scooter rider who filmed traveling atop a covered walkway has been arrested, police told reporters today. </p>
      <p>The incident captured in the viral clip took place Monday along Lompang Road in Bukit Panjang and a report was made to the police the next day, police said. </p>
      <p>An unidentified 19-year-old suspect was arrested Tuesday and accused of committing a “rash act,” police told <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/police-arrest-19-year-old-who-rode-pmd-top-sheltered-walkway"><i>Today</i></a>. If found guilty, he could be jailed up to six months, fined S$2,000 (US$1,470), or both. </p>
      <p>The nearly 30-second clip of the roof rider went viral this week after it was posted online. It attracted a wide range of comments, including laughs from those who thought the rider to be hilariously creative.</p>
      <p>The clip also sparked a new infrastructure idea from commenters who figured it might be a good idea for the government to invest in “flyovers” for personal mobility device users. That way, pedestrians and riders would not have to share paths and pedestrians are guaranteed shelter, some suggested. </p>
      <p>Riding on rooftops is just one of many things riders attempting to circumvent the footpath e-scooter ban, including riding on grass patches and curbs. </p>
      <p>Traversing grass patches is also illegal in Singapore, and riders can be fined up to S$5,000, according to NParks. That’s more than double the maximum S$2,000 fine announced for e-scooters footpath scofflaws. </p>
