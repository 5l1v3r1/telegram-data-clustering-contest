        <b>Barclays has rolled out an improved version of its biometric finger vein scanner, which enables corporates to complete banking transactions without the need for PINs and passwords.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Launched in 2015, the Barclays Biometric Reader (BBR), developed in collaboration with Hitachi, uses infra-red technology to identify the user by scanning their unique finger vein patterns.<br/><br/>The latest iteration of the device adds another layer of security with a ‘Sign What You See’ (SWYS) screen, displaying written instructions to the user describing the activity being authorised. Another key development is Bluetooth wireless connectivity, making it easier for users to manage their banking without having to physically connect the scanner to their computer. <br/><br/>Barclays says the enhancement have been designed in response to direct feedback from clients around the need for technology that fits with their increasingly mobile working patterns.<br/><br/>Martin Runow, head of digital banking at Barclays Corporate Banking says: “We’re committed to combating fraud. The new and improved Barclays Biometric Reader is much more portable and even more secure. Our clients are increasingly mobile and the advances we’ve been able to introduce will allow them to securely manage their accounts wherever they are."</p>
