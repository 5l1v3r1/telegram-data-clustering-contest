      <p>"You got him in the first issue!" Fraga said. "100%," echoed Seeley."</p>
      <p>Fraga continued: "When I was a kid, there was a muscle magazine by Joe Weider [Muscle &amp; Fitness] and they had He-Man on the cover and I remember thinking 'Oh my gosh, it's [Lundgren's Rocky character] Ivan Drago as He-Man!' Like, I didn't call him Dolph. But it was Ivan Drago as He-Man so I needed to see it. Yeah, man, I love that look and the movie. And I'm a big fan of Gwildor, I enjoy drawing Gwildor."</p>
      <p><i>He-Man and the Masters of the Multiverse</i> #1 is written by Tim Seeley and illustrated by Dan Fraga and Richard King. It is on sale now from DC Comics.</p>
