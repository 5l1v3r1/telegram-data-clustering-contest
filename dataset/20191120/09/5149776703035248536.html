      <h1>The astonishing level of research that Notts County go into when signing players is revealed</h1>
      <h2>Magpies boss Neal Ardley explained every detail of his recruitment process</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley has explained the extensive research that goes into signing players for Notts County as he hailed the "team effort" that went into their recruitment this summer.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> signed 13 players in a two-week period after Christoffer and Alexander Reedtz bought the club from previous owner Alan Hardy at the end of July.</p>
      <p>Having immediately lifted a transfer embargo, Notts then set about the task of identifying and recruiting talent which saw the likes of striker Wes Thomas and defender Ben Turner arrive at Meadow Lane.</p>
      <p>Speaking to a fans’ forum on Tuesday night, Magpies boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> explained the great level of detail that he and his staff went into in a bid to ensure they were the right fit for the club.</p>
      <p>“Recruitment is always the hardest part of football and God knows what it’s like in the Premier League when you have the agents and there are millions of pounds involved, because there are so many tangibles involved that would make signing a player difficult,” he said.</p>
      <p>“For us, the first rule of thumb is to try and identify the players or the positions you might want. We go through the shortlist and data, whatever it happens to be.</p>
      <p>“We then watch them because we’ve got to like what we see.</p>
      <p>“When I go back to my time at Wimbledon when we signed Adebayo Akinfenwa, Lyle Taylor and Tom Elliott, you have to watch videos of them time and time again. Not just clips, but full games to get a feel of ‘yes, this player is going to work for me.</p>
      <p>“Even then you’re not sure it’s going to work. Even Sir Alex Ferguson made mistakes at Manchester United with players who didn’t fit in the way they played.</p>
      <p>“We are trying to cut out the chances of failure down by going down the list.</p>
      <p>“Once we’ve identified them, the next question is will they come?</p>

      <p>“That can always be a problem. Players will first and foremost probably want to sign for a club for money and want to know what they are getting paid.</p>
      <p>"Second on that list is then the stature of the club and this is where Notts County have pulling power that perhaps we didn’t have at Wimbledon because we couldn’t take them round Kingsmeadow Stadium and show it off like we can here.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes third on the list is the manager. Players will do their homework and ask am I going to like playing for him and will he get the best out of me.</p>
      <p>“Finally it is then logistics. Are they local? Do they have a family? Do they want to live away from them? There are many obstacles to overcome. Normally the first question, when we’ve gone through all the data, is when I speak to an agent is, is he interested?</p>
      <p>“If the answer is no, then we move on. There’s no point going in any other detail.</p>
      <p>"When you get the feedback that yes he is interested, we then go through the rest of it and we’ve already done homework on whether he’s a good character, would he fit in and what’s he like in training. We’ve got enough contacts to find out truthful information on that player.</p>
      <p>“In the summer, in a two week period, for us to bring in 13 players in a short space of time was a really good team effort. Hopefully it has put us in good stead.”</p>

      <p>As a result of their extensive recruitment, Notts have 31 players on their books this season and it has meant that the likes of defender Matt Tootle, midfielder Tom Crawford and right-back Christian Oxlade-Chamberlain have not been included in the matchday squad.</p>
      <p>Ardley admits he is trying to trim down the numbers and has been trying to engineer loan players for those not in his plans.</p>
      <p>“It’s too big,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“I think I’ve mentioned before that I don’t like seeing players not playing football.</p>
      <p>“When I was playing, all I wanted was to play on the Saturday and have something to work towards in the week.</p>
      <p>“The way the team has been playing, the chances of those not in the squad forcing their way in are slim.</p>
      <p>“We’ve worked hard to try to get loan deals for players not involved. We’ve fallen on deaf ears and in some cases and it’s been turned down by the player.</p>
      <p>“That’s tough. When you turn up for training and there are 25/26 outfield players and you want to do 11 v 11 to prepare for a game, you’ve got six players extra to cater for.</p>
      <p>“They are off doing extra work at the side, and it’s tough. The squad is too big. We’d like to trim it down, not just for finnacial reasons, but for the core to know where we stand and the rest to get some playing time.”</p>
