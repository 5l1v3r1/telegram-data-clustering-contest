      <p>Every organisation or society is governed by rules so as to keep things in order. Well, despite the set down rules and regulations, some people still boldly flout them and also face the consequences.</p>
      <p>Just recently, a video went viral on social media where a teenage <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277249-woman-fights-school-security-teen-daughter-fixing-eyelashes.html">student at Queens’ College was refused entry into the school for fixing eyelashes.</a> To make the situation worse, the student’s mother engaged in a fight with the school’s security for not allowing her daughter access.</p>
      <p>The video caused quite a stir on social media as several people shared their opinion on the matter. Many were of the view that the mother is a bad one while others wondered how fixing eyelashes is a hindrance to studies.</p>
