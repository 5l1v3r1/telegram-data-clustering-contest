      <p>Alan Brown insists he wants to stop Brexit.</p>
      <p>The SNP candidate, 49, for Kilmarnock and Loudoun hopes to be re-elected to the seat he has held since 2015.</p>
      <p>And he wants to see a second referendum on the key issue of Brexit which has brought about next month’s election.</p>
      <p>“We think Brexit is a bad thing so we will work with other parties to stop it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The Lib Dems have promised to revoke Article 50 if they get enough support across the UK to have a majority in the House of Commons. I’d be a bit wary about that as people in England and Wales voted to leave the EU.</p>
      <p>“You can’t just unilaterally revoke Article 50 without the public having another say.”</p>
      <p>East Ayrshire and Scotland voted Remain in 2016’s Brexit poll but when asked why he would not accept the overall UK outcome of Leave, Mr Brown replied: “I appreciate and understand the argument.</p>
      <p>“But if I’m representing my constituents my constituents voted Remain and I’ve got to battle to respect their wishes.</p>
      <p>“Also the evidence we have seen, including from UK Government papers, shows Brexit is going to be bad economically. Why do I want to accept an outcome that my constituents didn’t want, Scotland didn’t want as a whole and would be bad for the country?</p>
      <p>“Accepting a bad outcome just to get it done is not a good outcome.”</p>

      <p>Caroline Hollins says Brexit must be delivered as that is what people voted for.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old has been selected to stand for the Conservatives in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency.</p>
      <p>Ms Hollins said she voted Remain in the European Union referendum in 2014.</p>
      <p>And she thinks it would be bad for democracy if the Leave outcome was not implemented.</p>
      <p>“I think Brexit is absolutely key,” she told the Standard. “Whether we agree with it or not, leaving the European Union was the democratic vote of the UK, of which one million were Scots. It’s really key that we get Brexit done.</p>
      <p>“We had a referendum and as a democracy the result should be accepted.</p>
      <p>“I personally voted for Remain. However, I do respect the will of the people and we cannot pretend the referendum never happened.”</p>
      <p>The last few years have been tough in the House of Commons as arguments raged between MPs but Ms Hollins feels it is what should be happening to achieve the best outcome.</p>
      <p>“A lot of people are angry about what they have seen,” she said. “I actually think it is democracy in action.”</p>

      <p>A Brexit-supporting parliamentary hopeful has backed the prospect of a People’s Vote.</p>
      <p>Stef Johnstone gave her support to the campaign and ruled out ever voting for no-deal Brexit this week.</p>
      <p>But the Scottish Libertarian candidate for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said she would have supported both Theresa May and Boris Johnson’s deals that went before the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>Ms Johnstone is the deputy leader of the pro-independence and pro-Brexit party. She is also the only candidate from the party to be standing in the UK.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old mum told the Standard: “I wouldn’t back a no-deal personally but I think it’s better to go with the People’s Vote.</p>
      <p>“It’s about people being able to have a say in their own everyday life instead of being tied down to government restrictions.”</p>
      <p>In 2016, 59 per cent of East Ayrshire voted to remain in the EU. Asked if this could be a difficult aspect for some voters to overcome when considering her as a candidate, Ms Johnstone added: “It would certainly have its difficulties but it wouldn’t be impossible.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to give the electorate a reason to want to change their vote.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to reach an overall consensus that’s good for everyone, not just one section.”</p>

      <p>Labour’s Brexit policy may not “roll off the tongue” but it is the best way forward, according to the Kilmarnock and Loudoun party candidate.</p>
      <p>Kevin McGregor believes Labour’s position is the best option for people on all sides of the debate.</p>
      <p>However, he also declared he would “absolutely” back Remain if there were to be a second referendum.</p>
      <p>Labour pledge to spend three months negotiating a deal with the EU before then putting that deal to a referendum against an option to Remain.</p>
      <p>Mr McGregor said: “Do I think there is no good Brexit?</p>
      <p>“No, there is no good Brexit but you have to accept that the people decided this and salvage what we can.</p>
      <p>“I think enough time has passed and enough mess has been made that if there is another referendum people would change their mind.</p>
      <p>“It is the duty of a Labour government to try and negotiate an acceptable deal and then put it to the people.”</p>
      <p>Mr McGregor said protections for workers would be at the forefront on any deal negotiated by a Labour government.</p>
      <p>“If we are leaving then we need to leave in a way that protects workers’ rights,” he insisted.</p>
      <p>“What was supposed to happen was we would take all the EU law which protects rights and wages and incorporate that into British law but the minute the vote went the way it did the Tory government started to chip away at that.</p>
      <p>“They are trying to finish what Thatcher started.”</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refuses to be drawn on where he would stand in the situation of a second referendum, something Mr McGregor said would be essential to his negotiating position with European leaders.</p>
      <p>“He cannot go and say I want a deal but I wouldn’t support it,” he said.</p>
      <p>When asked whether Labour’s internal division on the Leave/Remain issue would damage the unity of the party in the longer term, Mr McGregor said: “The interesting thing about Labour is that we are very good at having our disagreements in public.</p>
      <p>“It’s a situation which has never arisen before and I think the Labour party would survive that It’s the biggest social democratic party in Europe.”</p>
      <p>He insisted Labour are the only party offering an honest approach to the problem.</p>
      <p>“The SNP will say that Scotland voted to Remain in Europe and I find that interesting because if they had won the 2014 referendum we would already be out of the EU.”</p>
      <p>Mr McGregor admitted: “Labour’s policy does not roll off the tongue but it’s a good policy.</p>
      <p>“As much as I think Brexit would be a disaster, as a remainer in a Remain constituency, if I had the opportunity to campaign for Remain again then I absolutely would.</p>
      <p>“A no-deal Brexit would be terrible. However, the referendum went the way it did. No matter whether you argue that lies were told , it went the way it did.</p>
      <p>“Labour have to do what is democratically expected of them.”</p>

      <p>Revoking Article 50 will be done on day one of a majority Liberal Democrat government.</p>
      <p>That is according to the party’s candidate for Kilmarnock and Loudoun.</p>
      <p>Ed Thornley has been chosen to lead the line for the Scottish Liberal Democrats and remaining in the EU is top of the agenda.</p>
      <p>Mr Thornley said: “Our country is in the grip of a constitutional knot, pulled ever tighter with every passing day and at the expense of all other public policy considerations.</p>
      <p>“We have seen the total destruction of the arguments of the leave campaign.</p>
      <p>“Something begun by the will of the people should only be undone by the will of the people and the coming election may be the last opportunity for us to test that will.</p>
      <p>“Boris Johnson has stated on several occasions that he intends to interpret the result of a General Election as the manifest intent of the British people and what they think about Brexit.</p>
      <p>“If he can do that then so can we. He is fighting this election with a view to getting Brexit done, so we in the Liberal Democrats shall present the people with a counter-offer: get Brexit done and away with.</p>
      <p>“A majority Liberal Democrat government would revoke Article 50 on day one.</p>
      <p>“It’s time to stop Brexit and build a brighter future.”</p>
