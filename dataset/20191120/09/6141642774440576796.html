      <p>In a statement posted on social media alongside photos and a video of Bahasha and the new arrival, the zoo said: 'We certainly couldn't have topped off our 60th anniversary and a wonderful year celebrating gorillas in a more perfect way!'</p>
      <p>The zoo's gorillas have been in the limelight this year after a series of statues were placed across the Island during the summer.</p>
      <p>The 44 statues that made up the Go Wild Gorillas were sited at a range of locations across the Island before being auctioned earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The auction raised a total of £1,146,500 towards a new enclosure for the gorillas at the zoo in Trinity. One statue called The Space Between Us – designed by artist Andy Coutanche – sold for £72,000.</p>
