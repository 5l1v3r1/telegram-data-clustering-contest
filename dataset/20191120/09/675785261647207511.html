      <h1>Fascinating story behind Maude 'Lores' Bonney's solo flight from Australia</h1>
      <h2>Maude 'Lores' Bonney was a pioneer in aviation and flew an incredible distance before any of her peers - which will be why Google have decided to honour her with a Google Doodle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:09:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:09</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>Born in South Africa but raised multiple countries, Maude Bonney was educated in Melbourne, Australia dnt then in Germany.</p>
      <p>While growing up, Maude preferred to be called by her adopted name of Lores.</p>
      <p>When she was at finishing school in Germany, Lores met a leather goods manufacturer named Harry Barrington Bonney and the pair fell for each other and married in 1917.</p>
      <p>They went on to make their marital home in Brisbane, Queensland.</p>
      <p>Her life changed forever when she met an aviator from Queensland who also happened to a be relative of her husband named Burt Hinkler, who was a record-holder himself.</p>
      <p>Hinkler had flown various long-haul flights, but broke records with non-stop flights from England to Latvia, and then England and Australia in the 1920s.</p>
      <p>Inspired by Hinkler, Bonney took up lessons in secret, not telling her husband.</p>
      <p>However, when Harry found out, he bought her a de Havilland DH.60 Gypsy Moth of her own to fly.</p>
      <p>From here, Lores began her record-breaking flights.</p>

      <p>In 1931, Lores flew from Brisbane to Wangaratta in the longest one-day flight a female aviator had ever done, followed by a Round-Australia trip in 1932  which made her the first woman to circumnavigate the Australian mainland in the air.</p>
      <p>However, her most notable achievement came in 1933 when Lores flew from Brisbane to Croydon in the UK - a 20,000km journey across the world.</p>
      <p>Bonney was awarded as a Member of the Order of the British Empire by King George V for her success, with the Bonney Trophey in England still being awarded to outstanding British female pilots today.</p>
      <p>Eventually getting a new aircraft in the Klemm L32-V VH-UVE, she also completed the first flight from Australia to South Africa in 1937.</p>
      <p>World War Two soon put a stop to her career, however, despite her plans for flights all around, with one plane even being destroyed in a fire in 1939 and the other being scrapped after use in the war.</p>
      <p>In 1991, Lores was made a Member of the Order of Australia.</p>
      <p>Lores passed away in Miami, Queensland, in 1994 at the grand age of 96.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/google">Google</a> has honoured her today with a Google Doodle on what would have been her 122nd birthday.</p>
