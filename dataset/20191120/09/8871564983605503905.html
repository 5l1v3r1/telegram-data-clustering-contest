      <h1>Malaysian worker critically hurt in Singapore. Then came the medical bill.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:00:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>The family of a Malaysian man critically injured in a motorbike accident earlier this month in Singapore is seeking donations to foot his substantial medical expenses. </p>
      <p>His family is unable to pay the nearly S$50,000 bill racked up after Putra Affandi Ambiah, of Malaysia’s Johor Bahru, lost control and was thrown from his bike while heading home Nov. 10 from his job in Singapore along the Seletar Expressway.</p>
      <p>He underwent surgery and spent eight days recovering from his injuries at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun, which all added up to a hefty S$49,399. Affandi has been transferred back home to Johor Bahru’s Sultan Aminah Hospital after being discharged Monday from Khoo Teck Puat.</p>
      <p>“Affandi is a Malaysian who goes to and fro Singapore every day. He has a family of five to feed. His medical bills as of 12 November is already $28K. The family is in distress as they do not have the financial means to pay the medical bill,” reads the plea posted to a <a href="https://give.asia/campaign/help-support-affandi-for-his-medical-bills#/">fundraising campaign</a> verified by the Give Asia Kindness nonprofit. </p>
      <p>It added that he was not entitled to any government support as a migrant worker.</p>
      <p>“As a foreigner working in Singapore, his medical bills are not subsidized, and he will have to pay in full,” it said. No details of Affandi’s age and occupation were mentioned. </p>
      <p>His family had requested an earlier transfer from the Singaporean hospital since medical expenses in Malaysia would be cheaper, but his doctors denied the request, citing Affandi’s critical condition. </p>
      <p>Photos posted to the page show him lying in the intensive care unit with a brace around his neck. </p>
      <p>What made it worse for the family was the fact Affandi had no insurance coverage in Singapore. </p>
      <p>“Despite his critically ill condition, the family members have decided to bring him back to JB for further treatment as it is more affordable for them financially,” an <a href="https://give.asia/campaign/help-support-affandi-for-his-medical-bills#/updates">update posted</a> to the page yesterday showed. </p>
      <p>More than S$20,000 has been raised as of today.</p>
      <p>“Affandi’s condition is not stable yet. Every donation and every prayer will help the family through this period,” it added. </p>
