      <p>Scientists in India have completed clinical trials for a male form of birth control that lasts for 13 years.</p>
      <p>The contraceptive technique is administered via an injection into men’s testicles and the scientists claim that in 300 clinical trial patients they have witnessed no side effects.</p>
      <p>What remains is for the Indian equivalent of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to approve it for general use. After that, it could feasibly make its way into other countries.</p>
      <p>The process involves injecting (under local anesthesia) a polymer into the vas deferens, the tubule that delivers sperm from the testes to the penis where its released in ejaculate.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-closer-to-world-s-first-male-contraceptive-injection/story-o3lTFLnCkKHpuEDNNqrEnO.html">Hindustan Times</a>, the injection is 97.3% effective with no discernible side effects. Scientists have been working on perfecting it for a quarter of a century.</p>
      <p>‘The product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending with the Drugs Controller,’ said Dr RS Sharma, senior scientist with ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research).</p>

      <p>‘The trials are over, including extended, phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side-effects. The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive,’ he told the Times.</p>
      <p>In India, over half of couples use contraception but it is primarily the women who become responsible for managing it. It means they take on the side effects which, for the pill, can be weight gain, mood swings, nausea, acne, breast swelling and tenderness and breakthrough bleeding between periods.</p>
