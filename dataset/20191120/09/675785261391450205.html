      <h1>BREAKING: Poundland officially scraps £1 price promise in stores from today</h1>
      <h2>Newer pricing will mean more 50p and £5 offers in branches nationwide - with the chain promising broader ranges at "simpler prices" in three key categories - household goods, health and beauty and grocery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:25:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Budget retailer Poundland has scrapped its £1 price pledge, in a move that will see more £5 deals land on shelves.</p>
      <p>For the first time, every Poundland store will offer products above and below £1 - at a number of simple price points from 50p to £5.</p>
      <p>The move follows a trial in 24 West Midlands stores, two years after introducing £2 and £5 prices, in stores nationwide.</p>
      <p>It said the nationwide rollout will enable it to deliver a "broader range of items at simple prices in three key categories - household goods, health and beauty and grocery".</p>
      <p>Barry Williams, Poundland managing director said: "We've introduced simple pricing in time for Christmas so we can offer customers even more choice and even better value for money.</p>
      <p>"Our shoppers love the amazing value we provide and now we can begin bringing that value on wider ranges that they now can find in stores for the first time.</p>
      <p>"Our team of talented buyers has moved heaven and earth to bring these ranges to store in time for Christmas and I’d like to thank them for all their hard work."</p>
