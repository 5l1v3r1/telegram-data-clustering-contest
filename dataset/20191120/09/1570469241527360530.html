      <p>The pope's plane touched down outside Bangkok around midday for a visit that coincides with the 350th anniversary of the first papal mission in Siam, the former name of Thailand.</p>
      <p>"Dear friends in Thailand and Japan, before we meet, let us pray together that these days may be rich in grace and joy," read a message on the pontiff's official Twitter account before he left the Vatican.</p>
      <p>Catholics are a tiny minority in mostly Buddhist Thailand, accounting for less than 2 per cent of the population.</p>
      <p>Pope Francis will meet <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/thai-king-strips-disloyal-new-royal-consort-of-titles-257474">King Maha Vajiralongkorn,</a> as well as the supreme Buddhist patriarch and Catholic leaders and students before he moves on to Japan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>His translator in Thailand will be his cousin and childhood friend, Sister Ana Rosa Sivori, 77, who has worked in Thai schools for more than 50 years.</p>
