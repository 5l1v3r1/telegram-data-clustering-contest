      <h2>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has demanded answers from the Chinese government after Simon Cheng Man-kit says he was accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:42:46+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Doherty, Kathleen Speirs</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scottish-government-worker-held-visiting-18996207">Scottish Government worker</a> says he was tortured after being jailed in China during a business trip.</p>
      <p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has demanded a meeting with the Chinese ambassador after Simon Cheng Man-kit claimed he was shackled, blindfolded, hooded and beaten during his 15 days behind bars.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who works at the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scottish-perfume-firm-boss-trapped-20329175">British Embassy </a>in Hong Kong, vanished after crossing into mainland in August.</p>
      <p>Officials claimed at the time Mr Cheng was detained for "visiting a prostitute" and had confessed to an "illegal act".</p>
      <p>However, during an interview with the BBC he claimed his captors accused him of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong and forced him to sign confessions after being beaten.</p>

      <p>He said his captors "said they work for the secret service and that there are no human rights.</p>
      <p>"They would beat the bony parts, like my ankles... or any vulnerable part."</p>
      <p>Mr Cheng said the Chinese authorities accused Britain of supporting demonstrations in Hong Kong. </p>
      <p>He recalled: "They said I'm a state enemy and I'm a traitor, and also they asked whether the consulate instructed me to mingle with the protest." </p>
      <p>He added: "They wanted to know what role the UK had in the Hong Kong protests - they asked what support, money, and equipment we were giving to the protesters. </p>
      <p>"I told them I want to make it 100 per cent clear, the UK didn't assign resources or help with the protests." </p>
      <p>Unrest in the city state began in the summer with calls to scrap a now-suspended extradition bill, but have now widened to protest against the way Hong Kong is administered by Beijing. </p>
      <p>However, after Mr Cheng's release, his family said he suffered 'no external injuries'.</p>

      <p>A statement from the family read: "Thank you for all your concern for Simon, he has returned to Hong Kong safely, and is in the company of consulate staff and friends.</p>
      <p>"He has no external injury."</p>
      <p>Dominic Raab has said the Government was "shocked and appalled" by Mr Cheng's treatment which he believes "amounts to torture". </p>
      <p>He said: "Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team. </p>
      <p>"I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon, in violation of China's international obligations. </p>
      <p>"I have made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account."</p>
