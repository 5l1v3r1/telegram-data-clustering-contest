        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 20 – Former Attorney General Amos Wako has challenged the United States to make public corruption allegations against him following a travel ban issued last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wako, who is also Busia Senator, has also defended his wife Flora and son Julius–all banned from traveling to the US or doing business there over corruption allegations.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“I am a man of integrity because I have never been involved in any form of corruption,” he told a news conference Wednesday, a day after the US issued a travel ban against him two members of his family, “They are all adults and I am wondering why they are targetting them unfairly.”</p>
      <p>He also questioned why the US issued the same travel ban placed ten years ago, without giving more details on the corruption allegations they relied on.</p>
      <p>“When the US issued a travel ban against me in 2009, I instructed my attorney to write to them to demand this information and it was not forthcoming,” he said, “I still demand to know because I have never been implicated in corruption or prosecuted of the same.”</p>
      <p>Wako, his wife Flora Ngaira, and son Julius, were declared persons ineligible for entry into the United States on Monday.</p>
      <p>The State Department in a statement published Monday banned the three from traveling to the United States citing Wako’s “involvement in significant corruption.”</p>

      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued the declaration under Section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2019 (Div. F, P.L. 116-6) and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (Div. A, P.L. 116-59).</p>
      <p>“Section 7031(c) provides that, in cases where the Secretary of State has credible information that officials of foreign governments have been involved in significant corruption, those individuals and their immediate family members are ineligible for entry into the United States,” the State Department noted.</p>
