      <p>Zimbabwe Warriors coach Joey Antipas has sensationally announced his departure from the national team, exactly 24 hours after masterminding the downfall of Zambia in a Total Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Heroes Stadium in Zambia.</p>
      <p>The Warriors, against all odds, shocked the 2012 African champions, beating them 2-1 through a brace by poster boy Khama Billiat, who scored in either side of the half to register Zimbabwe’s first win over Chipolopolo in an Afcon qualifier.</p>
      <p>According to Zimbabwean publication the Chronicle, Antipas said: “I take a bow,” suggesting that he has thrown in the towel.</p>
      <p>The Zimbabwe Football Association is yet to confirm the departure of Antipas.</p>
      <p>Antipas lost just one game in charge of the Warriors, won three and drew two.</p>
      <p>He became unpopular with Warriors fans soon after his first game in charge when Zimbabwe lost 1-0 away to lowly-ranked Somalia in a 2022 Fifa World Cup qualifier.</p>
      <p>He was also under fire last Friday when the Warriors were held to a 0-0 draw by Botswana at home in an Afcon qualifier.</p>
