      <h1>‘What a player!’ Firmino praises Wijnaldum after Netherlands hat-trick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:55:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/tomsimmons/" target="_blank">Tom Simmons</a></address>
      <p>Roberto <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/av/football/47915356">Firmino</a> took to Instagram to salute his Liverpool team-mate Gini <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/20/video-gini-wijnaldums-stunning-netherlands-hat-trick-as-skipper-proves-hes-one-of-worlds-best-midfielders/">Wijnaldum</a> yesterday.</p>
      <p>Captaining the Netherlands, Gini scored three goals against Estonia in a 5-0 rout, with Holland now confirmed for next summer’s Euros.</p>
      <p>As Liverpool fans, we’ll be supporting them just as much as England due to Gini and Virgil van Dijk!</p>
      <p>Bobby posted ‘What a player!’ on Instagram in regards to Gini’s goals, with the 29-year-old now scoring an outrageous eight times in seven Euro 2020 qualification matches. If you enjoy a bet, his odds of scoring may be dramatically slashed in the coming fixtures. Alternatively, you may fancy trying the games on <a href="https://www.casumo.com/en-gb/">this site</a>, including the Football Star casino slot.</p>
      <p>All the Liverpool players on international duty have no finished games and will be preparing for Saturday’s tie with Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Mo Salah and Andy Robertson are injury doubts, while Joel Matip is definitely out.</p>
      <p>Hopefully the likes of Divock Origi, James Milner and Dejan Lovren can deputise efficiently in their absence.</p>
