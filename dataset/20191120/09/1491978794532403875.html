        <i>This is an eerie, devastating little book about a mother and son in the far north of Norway</i>
      </p>
      <p>In this perfectly poised Norwegian novella, Vibeke and her young son Jon have recently moved to the far north of Norway. The book follows them through one long evening and into the dead of night, as the cold and dark press in. The first thing we learn about Vibeke is that she uses books to escape reality: “She wishes she could read all the time, sitting in bed with the duvet pulled up.” She drifts through the hours, thinking about her new job, cooking dinner, heading out to the library. Dreams of new clothes and the possibility of romance sustain her as she ekes out life’s small excitements. “Normally she keeps the library until Saturday, and today’s only Wednesday.”</p>
      <p>Jon, meanwhile, has his own projects – biscuits to snaffle, raffle tickets to sell for the sports club – and his own daydreams, mostly about trains and train sets. Tomorrow he will be nine, and he decides to get out of the house for as long as possible to give Vibeke the opportunity to bake him a cake. Vibeke has entirely forgotten Jon’s birthday.</p>
      <p>Ørstavik’s ingenious device is to toggle between their two consciousnesses from one paragraph to the next, so that their narratives run as though on parallel train tracks, never to meet, even as they lie cheek to cheek. Layers of unremarkable everyday intimacy and acres of emotional distance are compressed between the lines. The two strands are connected by gossamer threads – or perhaps only by the reader’s desire to bring them together. We cut between Vibeke turning on her car headlights and Jon at home, blinking; or Jon staring down the stairs in a neighbour’s house and Vibeke walking into her bathroom to look in the mirror.</p>
      <p>Ørstavik builds a cinematic sense of dread out of the plainest prose, phrase layered on phrase with the hushed implacability of falling snow. As Vibeke undresses for a bath, in that classic scene of female vulnerability, and Jon hesitantly descends into the neighbour’s mysterious basement – “‘You’ll like this,’ the old man tells him” – the tension is almost unbearable.</p>
      <p>And so is the contrast between Jon and Vibeke’s inner worlds. It quickly becomes clear that while Jon is always thinking of his mother – she even looms large in his dreams – Vibeke is thinking only of herself. Jon is obviously quoting Vibeke when he explains their arrival in town to a girl he meets: “My mom had to get away. She was too young to be tied down.” Vibeke, by contrast, can barely see her son. “Can’t you just go,” she thinks, as he tells her about a picture he’s seen in a magazine of a man being tortured. Ørstavik has written about the figure of the bad mother before, in her other book to be translated into English, 2014’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/17/the-blue-room-hanne-orstavik-review"><i>The Blue Room</i></a>. It was a similarly chilling study of otherness and yearning; Ørstavik has found fertile territory here in which to dig into the raging solipsism of the inner life.</p>

      <p>One of the many uncanny things about this novella is that, though it was published in Norway more than two decades ago, it hasn’t dated at all (to the contrary: Jon’s obsession with images of torture has accrued a nasty significance after Abu Ghraib). Instead, it seems to float out of time. Everything becomes weightless in the cold, thinks Jon. “As if he were a bubble of air himself, ready at any moment to float into the sky and vanish into the firmament.” The extremity of the climate is an existential force within the book, serving to dwarf and muffle human interactions. Every interior space – the fairground trailer in which Vibeke chats awkwardly with a man she’s met, strangers’ houses and cars, that ominous basement – hovers between refuge and prison.</p>
      <p>At one point, she stares from the interior of the man’s car into a cafe: two sealed worlds separated by the darkness and cold of the night, but also by unbridgeable human desires. And if the characters are always retreating from the weather, they are also retreating from each other, closing their eyes and vanishing into the secret darkness of sleep or daydreams. “She likes him with his eyes shut too, immersed in his own world,” thinks Vibeke, staring at the man she hopes will offer her the love of the title.</p>
      <p>As the night wears on, Jon finds that he has forgotten his key. Vibeke’s quest for romance leaves him shut out of their home, just as he is shut out of her thoughts, and he begins his own faltering odyssey in her wake. “Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to go with strangers?” asks the unnerving woman who gives him a lift. “Not everyone’s as nice as me.” Every stranger is indeed strange in this eerie, devastating little book; but the same is true of family. We are all sealed worlds, Ørstavik seems to suggest; it’s dark outside, and it’s dark inside too.</p>
