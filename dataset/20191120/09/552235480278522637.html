      <p>A Larkhall thug who tried to rob a shop assistant at knifepoint claimed the frightening incident was only a prank.</p>
      <p>Brandon Watson fled empty-handed, but immediately went into a church and stole an elderly woman’s purse.</p>
      <p>Watson, 22, of Balfour Wynd, was jailed for 15 months at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>He admitted presenting a knife and demanding money from Kim Thain at Ashbridge Antiques in Union Street, Larkhall, on February 6.</p>
      <p>Watson also admitted stealing a purse containing cash and cards from St Machan’s Parish Church in nearby Church Street.</p>
      <p>Scott King, prosecuting, said the shop assistant was behind the counter when Watson arrived and demanded £40.</p>
      <p>He told the court: “She refused to hand over any money and told the accused to leave.</p>
      <p>“However, he stood where he was and lowered his right arm, exposing the tip of a knife concealed in his sleeve.</p>
      <p>“He directed the witness’s attention to this and again asked for money.</p>
      <p>“She refused again and Watson then said he was only joking, that he was filming proceedings to see what her reaction would be as part of a prank.</p>
      <p>“He then ran from the shop.”</p>
      <p>Watson went into St Machan’s Church, claiming he needed to see a minister because his dad had died.</p>
      <p>A prayer meeting was taking place and he was asked to wait.</p>
      <p>Mr King said: “There was a table beside him at the back of the church.</p>
      <p>“A woman aged 73 had left her handbag on the table and the accused took the purse from it.</p>
      <p>“People heard him leaving quickly and bags were checked. The woman realised her purse had been taken.</p>
      <p>“Police were in the area after being called about the attempted robbery at the shop.</p>
      <p>“They saw the accused, who matched the description of the suspect. He was searched and the purse was recovered.</p>
      <p>“The woman’s bank cards were still there, but £20 was missing.”</p>
      <p>Defence agent Diarmid Bruce said Watson has had difficulties with crack cocaine, heroin and valium. He had been taking drugs that day.</p>
      <p>Mr Bruce stated: “He doesn’t know where he was going. He can’t remember having a knife. The lady in the shop was quite brave and the explanation he gave was bizarre.</p>
      <p>“He has a record but this is, unfortunately, a step up for him.”</p>
      <p>Watson is currently serving a 13-month prison sentence for other offences and his earliest release date is February 19.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar said the 15-month stretch will start then.</p>
      <p>The sheriff noted that Watson had previous convictions for crimes of dishonesty and described the purse theft as “pretty mean”.</p>
