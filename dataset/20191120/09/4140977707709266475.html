            <b>KAT Vs MAR Dream11 : Karnataka Tuskers aspire to wrench out of their group stage impasse when they play their first Super League tie today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>With the mere one win from three encounters in Group A of the frontier T10 League, Karnataka Tuskers make an advent into the Super League round finding themselves languishing in bottom place. It’s not just the position they find themselves in but rather the manner in which those agonising and horrid defeats have come about which have really perturbed the side with the team completely failing to punch above their weight.</p>
          <p>The side’s peril was well documented in their most recent outing in the league, one which saw the side be subjected to a sorry 5 wicket win against Deccan Gladiators despite putting on 110 on the scoreboard. The bowling unit failed to show the vigour and fortitude needed to pull off a win despite being handed over a healthy score to defend, a performance the side will know they need to overturn at the earliest.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere for Group B leaders Maratha Arabians, today’s encounter is just the one the side would have wanted to line up to get their Super League sojourn underway. The side are entering the fray of today’s clash having tasted consummate success in their most recent outing with the side exuberating their exemplary bating might as they piled on a colossal 138 while bating first before refraining their opponents to 114 to canter their way to a 24 run win.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>We can keep doling out the same pitch report for every encounter in the T10 league given how sublime the conditions have been over here for the batsmen. The ball couldn’t lie onto the bat any more nicely with the batters finding it way too easy to send the bowlers dispatching to the fence.</p>

                            <h3>KAT Vs MAR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>The 35 runs he got in the opening slot for Karnataka Tuskers the last time around needed a mere 18 balls to get, seeing us make the side’s wicket-keeper, Johnson Charles an instant pick for us. It not only owing to that performance but the displays he’s doled out across the group stages to emerge as one of the most bankable and consistent names for his side.</p>
                            <h3>KAT Vs MAR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>A reason for Maratha Arabians piling on a behemoth 138 in the last match was down to their opening batsman Chris Lynn with the player heralding his way to 91 runs in just 30 balls. It was an innings which finally saw the player show what he’s truly capable of to make him our first name in this slot of our Dream 11 side along with Adam Lyth who scored 30 runs in the same match as the two strung together a 92 run stand for the first wicket. Opener Hazratullah Zazai will also be imbedded for this encounter from the side as we opt for a trivalent of selections from the unit.</p>
                            <p>The 32 runs in 19 balls the last time around make Hashim Amla our first pick from the other side of the slot along with Elvin Lewis who managed to get 23 runs in the first outing for the side the last time around with Ross Whiteley completing the trio of picks from the outfit.</p>
                            <h3>KAT Vs MAR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Just the one pick for us in this facet of our Dream 11 side with Ahmed Raza being brought in by us for the day given the ascertained two overs with the ball he’s bound to send down.</p>
                            <h3>KAT Vs MAR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Whilst their batting unit has been exceptional, Maratha Arabians know that their success couldn’t have been warranted without quick Mitchell McCleneghan. Across his stay in the showpiece league, the player has been in stupendous form, sending down an ominous line and length, something which was alluded to in the last encounter as well as he gave away just the 1-17.</p>
                            <p>Wanindu Hasaranga is also brought in from the side given the paper thin nature of his opponent’s batting order whilst from the Tuskers we are wrapping up our side with the singular selection of Pat Brown.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We are choosing Billings as our captain for the day whilst Russell comes in as the vice-captain.</p>
