      <p>Overnight fame and success got Ranu Mondal from streets to stardom. Discovered by singer-composer Himesh Reshammiya who made her a star overnight with lustrous singing offers is a known fact. But with success comes major responsibilities and hardship to sustain the same. First, she was trolled on social media for her rude behaviour towards a fan, now a <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/Ranu%20Mondal%20">heavy OTT makeover picture</a> of Ranu created headlines after she was trolled for it.  Throwing quick light on the previous incident, a fan wanting to click a selfie with Ranu touched her, on which she snapped saying, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/ranu-mondal-s-don-t-touch-me-moment-gives-birth-to-some-hilarious-memes-pictures-inside/5dc26f8f87fb571eff7e3774">“Don't touch me, I'm celebrity</a>”<br/><br/>While social media users went berserk, slamming and trolling Ranu for her rude behaviour, You Tuber Bhuvan Bam, has come in support of the singing sensation. Giving out his opinion on his Instagram story, Bhuvan feels Ranu got fame and success but has never lived in an atmosphere, where she would know how to reciprocate if someone appreciated her. He said that in today’s time, being educated enough we are aware of where we should be talking what, but not Ranu, who suddenly became famous. He also mentioned that she comes from a background where she hasn't seen all this and this stardom is very new to her. Bhuvan Bam says that she shot to fame suddenly and did not have the time to groom herself, unlike others.
