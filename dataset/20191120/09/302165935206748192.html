      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 20 — Historically low eurozone interest rates likely to persist into the foreseeable future are causing increased risk-taking that could threaten financial stability, the European Central Bank said today.</p>
      <p>“While the low interest rate environment supports the overall economy, we also note an increase in risk-taking which could... create financial stability challenges,” ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Signs of excessive risk-taking” were spotted by the Frankfurt institution among non-bank financial players like “investment funds, insurance companies and pension funds”.</p>
      <p>Many “have increased their exposure to riskier segments of the corporate and sovereign sectors,” it said.</p>
      <p>Extremely low or negative yields on debt from safer borrowers have prompted investors to seek out riskier bets in search of returns.</p>
      <p>But while the ECB’s twice-yearly update to its risk assessment shifted focus from May’s trade war concerns, “downside risks to global and euro area economic growth have increased” in the meantime, it warned.</p>
      <p>Such dangers included “persistent uncertainty, an escalation in trade protectionism, a no-deal Brexit and weak performance of emerging markets,” notably China, the ECB said.</p>
      <p>An economic downturn could crash prices for riskier and less liquid assets as actors like asset managers or hedge funds sell up in a hurry.</p>
      <p>“This may have implications for the ease and cost of corporate financing which could exacerbate any real economy downturn,” the ECB warned.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the economy, lower interest rates also “appear to be encouraging more borrowing by riskier firms” in non-financial sectors, as well as inflating property prices in some parts of the eurozone.</p>
      <p>But the ECB judged that authorities in the 19 eurozone countries were already taking steps to head off financial stability risks from property bubbles.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the central bank found that “bank profitability concerns remain prominent” as growth has weakened and eurozone policymakers further lowered a key interest rate in September.</p>
      <p>As well as outside pressure, banks “have made slow progress in addressing structural challenges”.</p>
      <p>Those include slow improvements on multiple fronts like disposing of so-called “non-performing” loans, where borrowers have fallen behind on payments.</p>
      <p>Lenders must also cut costs and reduce overcapacity, and are largely failing to diversify their businesses, the ECB judged.</p>
      <p>But most banks have the liquid assets on hand to withstand any foreseeable financial shocks, it added. — AFP</p>
