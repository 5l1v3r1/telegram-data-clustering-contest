      <p>Travelling abroad on your own can be a liberating and confidence-building experience. However, at Christmas even the most experienced traveller can become homesick for their local traditions. </p>
      <p>Around the festive season, it is important to check in with your family and friends. Even if you can’t be physically present, make sure to let your loved ones know you are thinking of them. </p>
      <p><b>Use Skype or FaceTime</b> <br/>You are fortunate enough to live in a world of smart phones and much more. Download Skype or FaceTime to connect with your loved ones this Christmas. Do your friends live all over the world? Don’t worry, you can link multiple people into the Skype call so that you can all chat together like old times. </p>
      <p>You could even Skype your family on Christmas Day so that you can be a part of opening presents, making dinner and watching your favourite holiday movie. </p>
      <p><b>Send a gift</b> <br/>You can still send presents and hand-written notes to your friends and family. Why not send them a token of your travels for Christmas this year? Gifts, no matter how big or small, are a great way to show that you are thinking of someone. </p>
      <p>Besides, it’s Christmas! Everyone needs a present at this time of year. Check out <a href="https://www.parcel2go.com/international-couriers">Parcel2Go</a> for cheap international delivery from a range of international couriers. </p>
      <p><b>Write a Christmas card</b><br/>If you can’t send a gift, you can always write Christmas cards to get into the holiday spirit. Use <a href="https://www.funkypigeon.com/">FunkyPigeon</a> or <a href="https://www.moonpig.com/uk/">Moonpig</a> to send your family Christmas cards straight from your phone. Just make sure to use the UK version of these sites to reduce delivery rates.</p>
      <p><b>Make an interactive holiday playlist</b> <br/>If you are feeling homesick, why not connect with your family on <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/">Spotify</a>? Create a public playlist to share with your loved ones. You can each add your favourite Christmas tunes to one playlist. This way, you can listen to your family’s playlist while enjoying your travels at the same time. </p>
      <p><b>Post on social media</b><br/>Share your holiday photos on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat! You can have a conversation with your friends and family through comments and messages - without having to find a strong enough WiFi signal to call them. </p>
      <p>Remember to embrace Christmas traditions around the world this year.</p>
