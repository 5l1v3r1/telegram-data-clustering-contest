      <p>Acting Police Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, says several firearms have been found in a house the leafy suburb of Wierdabrug outside Pretoria.</p>
      <p>This comes after police uncovered a massive arms cache as well as a dagga laboratory on the premises on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The owner of the house a 50-year-old man has been arrested and is expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate's court on Thursday. Â </p>
      <p>Motsoaledi says the man claimed to be a collector of firearms but some firearms that should have been deactivated as a collector's items were not.</p>
      <p>The man is being charged in terms of the Firearm Control Act as well as the Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act.</p>
      <p>All live arms will be sent for ballistic tests to establish if they were used in the commission of other crimes, whilst every other item will be individually analysed.</p>
      <p>Police initially found the dagga cultivation lab and upon further investigation, they discovered hidden rooms inside the house where handguns, rifles, crossbows, boxes of ammunition and even a rocket launcher was found.</p>
