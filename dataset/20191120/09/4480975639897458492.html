      <h1>GBP/USD Technical Analysis: Drops to fresh weekly lows, below 1.2900 handle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:18:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/haresh-menghani" target="_blank">Haresh Menghani</a></address>

          <b>The GBP/USD pair extended its recent pullback from the 1.30 neighbourhood.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Sustained weakness below 100-hour SMA was seen as a key trigger for bears.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The GBP/USD pair extended this week's pullback from the vicinity of the key 1.30 psychological mark and remained under some selling pressure for the second consecutive session on Wednesday.<br/> <br/>The pair finally broke down of its late-Asian session consolidative trading range and dropped to fresh weekly lows in the last hour, with bulls failing to defend the 1.2900 round-figure mark.<br/> <br/>A sustained break below 100-hour SMA was seen as a key trigger for bearish traders and dragged the pair further below 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the 1.2769-1.2986 last week’s positive move.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, oscillators on hourly charts have been drifting lower but held in the bullish territory on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> and warrant some caution before placing any aggressive directional bets.<br/> <br/>Hence, any subsequent slide is likely to find some support near the 1.2875 region (50% Fibo.), which if broken will set the stage for a sharp drop towards mid-1.2800s (61.8% Fibo.).<br/> <br/>On the flip side, any attempted bounce might confront some supply near the 100-hour SMA, currently near the 1.2910 region, and should remain capped near the 1.2930-35 region (23.6% Fibo.).</p>
