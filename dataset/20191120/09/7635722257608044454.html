        <b>The mother of an 11-year-old girl, who has not secured a secondary school place for next year, says she has no alternative option if things don't work out at their local school.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lyn from Malahide in North Dublin has put her daughter - who is currently in sixth class - on a waiting list for a local secondary school.</p>
      <p>However, she says she has no option open to her if a place cannot be guaranteed next September.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>Newstalk Breakfast</i>, Lyn explained: "I don't know if you can imagine what this is doing to us and her... going into school every day and all the kids talking about their place in secondary school.</p>
      <blockquote>"I don't have an alternative - there's no other school in my area."</blockquote>
      <p>She suggested: "It's no shocker - in 2012, all of these kids went into primary school. In 2020, those same children are going to need a place in secondary school.</p>
      <blockquote>"I would have hoped and asked and just wanted that a child could go to school where they're brought up and where they live... it's actually so upsetting and very stressful."</blockquote>
      <p>Lyn says she does think her daughter will eventually secure a place, but they will be left 'dangling' until that happens.</p>
      <p>She added: "I don't know when - and that really stresses me out.</p>
      <p>"I don't know when we'll get that letter, and until I get that letter I won't be happy or content."</p>
      <p>She called for Government planning to ensure school needs are met for the local community, as well as a 'sensible registration list' where parents are 'upfront, honest and open' about the schools they are applying for.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Department of Education said they use a geographical information system to identify where the pressure for school places across the country arises.</p>
      <p>They added that a new post-primary school was established last year in the area, and the requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review.</p>
