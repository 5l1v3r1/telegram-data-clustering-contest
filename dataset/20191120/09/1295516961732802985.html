      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, director Todd Phillips is currently talking with Warner Bros. about returning for a sequel to <i>Joker</i>. He and Scott Silver, with whom he worked on the original, are said to be writing the sequel, which will presumably see Joaquin Phoenix returning to star due to options in his contract. Warner Bros. did not comment on the report.</p>

      <p>Since releasing earlier this year, <i>Joker </i>has becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time as well as the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-movie-1-billion-box-office/">first movie with that rating</a> to gross $1 billion at the worldwide box office. Since the film only had a budget of around $60 million, <i>Joker </i>has proven immensely profitable for Warner Bros. Although the movie garnered controversy, <i>Joker </i>is generally considered to be a contender for this year's Academy Awards following its win of the coveted Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
      <p>Directed by Todd Phillips, <a href="https://screenrant.com/joaquin-phoenix-jokers-ending/">Joker</a> stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. The film is now in theaters.</p>
