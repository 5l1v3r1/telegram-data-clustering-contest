      <p>HONG KONG -- The Hong Kong Open golf tournament has been postponed because of violent unrest in the city.</p>
      <p>The tournament was scheduled to be held at Hong Kong Golf Club from Nov. 28 to Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>A statement posted on the Hong Kong Open's website said the European Tour made the decision to postpone in conjunction with the tournament's co-sanctioning partner at the Asian Tour, and that an attempt will be made to reschedule it for early next year.</p>
      <p>Unrest has gripped the semi-autonomous Chinese city for more than five months.</p>
      <p>Addressing ongoing safety concerns, European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley says "we feel this is the correct, but unfortunate, course of action."</p>
