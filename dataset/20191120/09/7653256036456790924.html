      <p>Bengaluru: Technology giant <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/IBM">IBM</a> on Wednesday launched 'Cloud Pak for Security', featuring innovations to connect with any security tool, cloud or on-premise system, without moving data from its original source.</p>
      <p>The platform includes open-source technology for hunting threats, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/automation">automation</a> capabilities to help speed response to cyberattacks, and the ability to run in any environment, the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It is the first platform to leverage new open-source technology pioneered by IBM, which can search and translate security data from a variety of sources, bringing together critical security insights from across a company's multicloud IT environment, the company claimed.</p>
      <p>The platform is extensible, so that additional tools and applications can be added over time, the statement said.</p>
      <p>As businesses move further into cloud maturity, applications and data are frequently spread across multiple private and public clouds and on-premise resources, IBM noted.</p>
      <p>Attempts to protect this fragmented IT environmentoften require security teams to undertake complex integrationsand continuously switch between different screens and point products.</p>
      <p>General Manager, IBM Security, Mary O'Brien was quoted as saying, "With Cloud Pak for Security, we're helping to lay the foundation for a more connected security ecosystem designed for the hybrid, multicloud world."</p>
