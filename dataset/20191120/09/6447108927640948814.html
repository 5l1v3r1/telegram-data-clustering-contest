      <p>Following on from our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/06/sennheiser-gsp-670-review-ps4-headset/">Sennheiser’s GSP 670 wireless gaming headset</a>, we recently got our hands on the newer 370 model. Like its beefier older cousin, this headset is aimed primarily PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac gamers, though doesn’t have all the same features. It may not be quite as versatile, but it’s almost half the price at £169 and still carries over some of the best features we’ve seen in the Sennhesier gaming range.</p>

      <p>Setup takes no time at all. After a brief unboxing, all you need to do is plug in the GSA 370 wireless dongle and you’ll be ready to go. Naturally, after buying any new gaming peripheral, you might be tempted to adjust some dials and advanced settings, all of which can be done by downloading Sennheiser’s gaming suite software to your PC. The one downside here is that there’s no onboard profiles for the headset, meaning that such tweaks remain on the PC and PS4 users simply have the console’s built in volume and chat mix management.</p>
      <p>The GSP 370 is both stylish and lightweight at just under 300 grams. Its overall design is fairly subtle, combining dark greys and matte blacks for a look that may not immediately catch your eye yet sidesteps some of the ugly and edgy “gamer” aesthetics we see in other manufacturer’s wares.</p>

      <p>What matters most is comfort and functionality. It’s built with those longer gaming sessions in mind, whether you’re losing yourself in a sprawling fantasy epic or settling in for a multiplayer marathon. Whatever the scenario, the GSP 370 is up to the task thanks to its superb material and build quality, featuring similar memory foam earpads as other Sennheiser headsets.</p>
      <p>One feature that will appeal to many is the extended battery life of this newer model, boasting an incredible 100 hours of juice after a full charge! That figure is dependent on volume and microphone usage – it’s “up to” 100 hours – but there’s a handy button on one of the ear cuffs that will display a coloured light indicating how much battery the device has before it needs to be plugged in. I barely managed to dent that run time while reviewing the headset, and suspect that only the most absent-minded gamers will see the battery run dry.</p>

      <p>Transitioning from the premium GSP 670 model to the 370, there was an obvious difference in terms of audio quality. It shares the same low latency wireless tech and the sound is clean and layered, but it’s fair to say that the richness of the 670’s bass performance has spoiled us. It establishes a high bar this cheaper Sennhesier model can’t quite meet.</p>
      <p>Still, compared to other headsets in this price range, it’s a robust choice and one that gets extra points for its boom arm microphone. Being able to mute your voice audio by simply lifting the arm is a small touch though one we’ve come to love wherever we find it. The microphone itself is one of the best in this price range thanks to Sennheiser’s built in noise cancelling tech, making it perfect for party chat in games or if you’re running a stream.</p>
      <p>At £169 the GSP 370 straddles the line between the mid-range and the god-tier, and that means that its competition at this price point is fairly minimal. It does however have to go up against Steelseries Arctis 7, easily one of the best gaming headsets of the past few years, and which, if you’re lucky, you’ll be able to find on sale for thirty or forty pounds cheaper. That said, while they’re both very comfortable the GSP 370 beats it out on sound quality.</p>
