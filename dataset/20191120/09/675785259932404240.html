      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T09:47:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 09:47</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>In news that will come as music to the ears of many women, scientists have revealed that a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/contraception">male birth control </a>is almost ready.</p>
      <p>The birth control involves an injection directly into the penis, and has just successfully completed a clinical trial at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hindustan-times-ltd">Hindustan Times</a>, Dr R.S Sharma, a senior scientist with the ICMR, said: “The product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending [from the government].</p>
      <p>“The trials are over, including extended, Phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with a 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects. The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive.”</p>
      <p>The birth control is made from a polymer called styrene malieic anhydride, and is injected into the vas deferent - the two ducts that carry sperm out of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/testicles">testicles</a>.</p>

      <p>There, the polymer effectively blocks sperm from leaving the testicles, and amazingly, the effect can last for up to 13 years.</p>
      <p>Professor S.K Guha, a scientist from the Indian Institute of Technology, said: “The polymer was developed by Professor S.K. Guha from the Indian Institute of Technology in the 1970s. ICMR has been researching on it to turn it into a product for mass use since 1984, and the final product is ready after exhaustive trials.”</p>
      <p>The researchers suggest that the product will be available within the next seven months, although it seems many men are sceptical of male birth controls.</p>
      <p>A recent survey by YouGov revealed only one in three men would be willing to take male birth control.</p>
      <p>However, the injection isn’t the only male birth control in the works.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the Los Angeles Biomed Research Institute have developed a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/male-birth-control-pill-passes-14183674">male birth control pill</a> that’s now been successfully tested in healthy men.</p>
      <p>Based on the findings, the researchers believe that the pill could be widely available ‘in about 10 years.’</p>
