      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Dubai’s carrier Emirates announces firm order for 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners in deal valued at $8.8 billion.</p>
      <p>Emirates CEO and Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum says the agreement replaces a deal for the 777x aircraft. He spoke to reporters Wednesday at the Dubai Airshow.</p>
      <p>Combined with Emirates’ previous announcement this week for new Airbus aircraft, this brings the airline’s total orders at the airshow to $24 billion. Airlines, however, typically negotiate steep discounts from manufacturers.</p>
