      <p>The Esperance Chamber of Commerce and Industry has urged community members to shop local this Christmas.</p>
      <p>Chamber executive officer Bronwyn McLeod said the flow-on benefits of buying local were felt throughout the town.</p>
      <p>"Be the best for Esperance and the business community," she said.</p>
      <p>"If you buy something from McCreeds Classique Jewellers for instance, you know they're going to put that money back into the town by shopping at the local IGA store of somewhere like that.</p>
      <p>"If you buy local, you've got your friendly customer service. And if something goes wrong, you can take it back and get it fixed or replaced. You don't have to send it away. We've got everything here, why not buy local?"</p>
      <p>Mrs McLeod said online shopping had been a major challenge to businesses, and not only in retail.</p>
      <p>"It's online shopping with accommodation. If you book online, often that money doesn't even stay in Australia. If you ring and book over the phone that money stays in our town," she said.</p>
      <p>Business Local advisor Jayde Guest said she believed things were starting to turn around and people were more aware of the need to support local shops.</p>
      <p>"We are seeing the impacts of people shopping online now," she said.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully that means we've gone through the low and now we just need to keep educating people to shop local.</p>
      <p>"Shops will shut down if we don't support them, so let's work together to support each other."</p>
      <p>Mrs Guest said if consumers spent an extra $10 a month, it would create an additional $216 million in trade a year.</p>
      <p>Some tips from the chamber for businesses to encourage customers to shop local include good customer service, being available and helping clients when they're in the store.</p>
      <p>Mrs Guest also said it was important to advertise what they had available and suggested running competitions around Christmas.</p>
