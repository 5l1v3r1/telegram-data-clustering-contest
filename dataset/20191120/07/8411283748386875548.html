      <p>Chinese handset vendors are eager to adopt anylayer HDI boards for their high-end smartphones, but they currently have to source such boards from outside of China despite the country's bid to raise self-sufficiency for electronics components. Taiwan-based PCB makers <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191120PD216.html">Compeq and Unimicron</a> are among those that are able to satisfy Chinese handset vendors' rising demand for anylayer HDI boards. Taiwan-based IC design houses have also seen increases in orders from China for chips supporting <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191120PD205.html">fast-charging</a>, and many of them expect strong fourth-quarter 2019 results. In the optoelectronics sector, mini LEDs are presenting opportunities. Taiwan-based <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191120PD209.html">Epistar</a> is ready to expand capacity for the mini LED segment next year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191120PD216.html">Anylayer HDI demand from Chinese handset vendors rising sharply</a>: Chinese handset vendors are keen on utilizing anylayer HDI boards as mainboards for high-end smartphones adopting 7nm APs, and Taiwan-based PCB makers including Compeq Manufacturing and Unimicron are in a better position to meet the growing demand thanks to their higher yield rates and technology levels than Chinese peers', according to industry sources.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191120PD205.html">Taiwan analog IC firms see orders for fast-charging devices pick up from China</a>: Taiwan-based analog IC specialists have recently seen orders mainly short lead-time ones for fast-charging solutions pick up from China's high-tech industry, which is looking to reduce its dependence on US-made chips, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191120PD209.html">Epistar to allocate at least NT$5 billion for 2020 capex</a>: LED wafer and chip maker Epistar has disclosed plans to set aside a capex budget of at least NT$5 billion (US$164 million) for 2020, mainly for expanding production capacities for mini LEDs, backlight units (BLUs) and VCSEL wafers and diodes.</p>
