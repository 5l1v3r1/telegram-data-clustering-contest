        <b>Ray J’s heavily pregnant wife has accused the singer of leaving her ‘stranded in Las Vegas’ with their young daughter, and claims he’s blocked her from calling his phone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The couple, who married in August 2016, looked like a happy family when they attended the BET Soul Train Awards on Sunday and posed for photos on the red carpet with their one-year-old daughter Melody.</p>
      <p>However, Princess splashed cold water on their happy family image when Ray J posted one of the photos on Instagram.</p>
      <p>‘Thank you @bet. #SoulTrainAwards @princesslove @melodylovenorwood,’ he wrote alongside the photo.</p>
      <p>Princess, 35, is said to commented: ‘Left me and Melody stranded in Vegas and blocked me from calling.. Now you wanna post family photos #ByeUgly,’ with a cry laughing emoji.</p>
      <p>Ray J, 38, has since deleted the image and has not commented on the situation.</p>
      <p>Some questioned why Princess was unable to fly or drive herself back to Los Angeles where the family live, but she hit back and explained that she didn’t want to do the journey alone being heavily pregnant with a toddler.</p>

      <p>‘Yes I can fly home. I have my own money. But my car is here and I don’t want to drive back alone with my daughter because I’m over 8 months pregnant and I don’t even want to have to stop for gas or go into labour with all of this human trafficking going on,’ she wrote in her now-deleted Instagram stories.</p>

      <p>It’s not the first time Princess and Ray J have fought publicly with their rocky relationship playing out in earlier episodes of Love &amp; Hip Hop.</p>
      <p>The couple announced they were expecting their second child in August, with Ray J confirming: ‘Baby #2 on the way! @MelodyLoveNorwood your about to be a big sister! #Godisthegreatest.’</p>

      <p>Last month, it was revealed they are having a boy giving Melody, who was born in May 2018, a little brother to play with.</p>
      <p>Ray J has surprised fans but also himself by transforming into a family man after years of living the playboy lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Opening up about how fatherhood and marriage has changed him, the One Wish singer <a href="https://www.celebsnow.co.uk/latest-celebrity-news/ray-j-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-762078">told Celebs Now</a>: ‘I didn’t think settling down was possible. Listen, when you’re living like I was and having that much fun, at some point you’ve got to go into the next phase.</p>
      <p>‘For me, I just feel like God knew when to change things but I still had to put the work in. And that’s being faithful, firstly.</p>
      <p>‘That’s the hardest thing to do as someone who has all of these options. It’s been ok for me though because I’m partied out – it came at the perfect time.’</p>
