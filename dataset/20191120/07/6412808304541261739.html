      <h4>Malaysia <a href="https://says.com/my/sports/indonesian-fans-allegedly-threw-flares-at-m-sian-fans-in-reaction-to-harimau-malaya-s-win">defeated</a> Indonesia 2-0 in a glorious game of football during the joint qualifier for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and 2023 Asian Cup last night, 19 November</h4>
      <p>Crowd favourite winger Safawi Rasid brought the game home - scoring a free kick after drawing a foul in the 29th minute to make it 1-0, before scoring another goal in the 72nd minute.ï»¿</p>

      <h4>Equally worthy of attention though, were the Harimau Malaya fans - also known as the Ultras Malaya - for their relentless team spirit inside and outside of Bukit Jalil National Stadium, KL.<br/>Here were the many ways they have captured attention online:</h4>
      <h4>The Ultras Malaya had rhythm and, more impressively, a drum line</h4>
      <p>Feel amazed watching these thousands of fans singing and jumping in unison in support of our national football team.<br/><br/>They were energetically bouncing to a fan-favourite football chant 'Demi Malaysia'.</p>

      <h4>The fans literally spelled out their national pride while <a href="https://says.com/my/sports/the-day-negaraku-played-at-the-paralympics-for-the-first-time-in-history">'Negaraku'</a> played at the opening ceremony</h4>
      <p>As the national anthem aired over the stadium, the audience stood up in attention, making an incredible 'tifo' displaying a single word - 'Malaysia'.</p>

      <h4>But seriously, what is a football game without the fans?</h4>
      <p>Watch as almost all the 85,000 spectators sing a Harimau Malaya favourite chant 'Kami Selalu Ada' in beautiful chorus.<br/><br/>I kind of feel sorry for the 6,000 Indonesian fans who came all the way to see the game.</p>

      <h4>Diehard fans who watched the match at home also caught on to the contagious team spirit</h4>
      <p>These fans singing 'Kami Selalu Ada' along to their television at home while waving the Jalur Gemilang brought tears to my eyes.</p>
