      <p>The Liberal Democrats have pledged to spend an extra £10 billion a year on schools and recruit 20,000 more teachers if they gain power.</p>
      <p>As the party launches its General Election manifesto on Wednesday the Lib Dems are promising to reverse frontline school cuts imposed since 2015 with an “emergency cash injection” of £4.6 billion next year.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems insisted that by 2024/25, the party will spend £10.6 billion more on schools than in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>The money will help boost teacher numbers by 20,000 over five years, the Lib Dems said.</p>

      <p>The party said it would attract and retain teachers by increasing starting salaries to £30,000 and guaranteeing all teachers a pay rise of at least 3% a year over the next five years.</p>
      <p>The extra resources would also be used to boost support for children with special educational needs or a disability.</p>
      <p>Some £7 billion would be spent on improving school buildings over the next five years, the party said.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems insisted £10 billion of what it claims would be a £50 billion economic bonus from staying in the EU would be used to increase school funding.</p>
      <p>Party leader Jo Swinson said: “This is an investment in our children’s future. Our schools should be world class, helping every child make the most of the challenges ahead.</p>
      <blockquote>It is disgraceful that some schools feel they have no choice but to ask parents to chip in for supplies, and are closing early on Friday to balance the books<cite>Jo Swinson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“But instead, they are trailing behind. The Conservatives have cut school funding to the bone and children have paid the price, especially those with the most complex needs.</p>
      <p>“It is disgraceful that some schools feel they have no choice but to ask parents to chip in for supplies, and are closing early on Friday to balance the books.</p>
      <p>“Liberal Democrats will build a brighter future for every child. By stopping Brexit, we can spend £10 billion of our Remain bonus on reversing school cuts and hiring 20,000 more teachers – so that pupils can leave school happy, healthy and with the skills they need to succeed in life.”</p>
