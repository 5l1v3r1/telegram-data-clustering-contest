        <b>Tottenham’s new manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly a big admirer of the profile of the squad he’s inheriting at the north London club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Spurs announced this morning that Mourinho had been appointed to replace Mauricio Pochettino, whose departure was confirmed on Tuesday evening.</p>

      <p>This follows plenty of speculation linking the Portuguese tactician with Tottenham, and these reports give some idea of why he may have been keen on the job.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/exclusive-jose-mourinho-eyes-tottenham-job-following-mauricio/">Telegraph</a>, Mourinho is keen on Harry Kane and Eric Dier in particular, with the latter somewhat frozen out of the Spurs first-team in recent times by Pochettino.</p>
      <p>His apparent enthusiasm about working with Kane should come as no surprise, with the England international showing himself to be one of the world’s finest goal-scorers in recent years.</p>

      <p>Mourinho could have done with a lethal centre-forward like him at his previous job at Manchester United, as he’s often found success throughout his career with strikers of this type.</p>
      <p>Dier, however, has seen his development stall in recent times and perhaps seems quite a limited player, though Mourinho has shown in the past that he can improve players with his tactics and man-management.</p>
