      <p>Forget about Romione, it sounds like Rupert Grint is a Dramione shipper! Jokes aside, the actor says he really did see a ‘spark’ between Emma Watson and Tom Felton on the set of Harry Potter!</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say that if it went anywhere, Emma and Tom could have been one of the most iconic pairs in the industry and a dream come true for millions of fans!</p>
      <p>And it turns out that Rupert saw their chemistry as well!</p>
      <p>During a chat about his brand new Apple+ series The Servant, the actor also opened up about his Harry Potter days, telling Entertainment Tonight‘s Rachel Smith all about the ‘spark’ he saw between Tom and Emma.</p>
      <p>‘There was always something. There was a bit of a spark,’ he told the host.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old actor went on to explain that the reason why he never wanted to say anything at the time was that they spend so many years on set together.</p>
      <p>However, he stressed once again that he really did see ‘some sparks’ between the actors who portrayed Hogwarts rivals Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy.</p>
      <p>Of course, at the time, they were a bit too young for it to go anywhere.</p>
      <p>‘But we were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance,’ Rupert added.</p>
      <p>Indeed, since Emma and Tom started their Harry Potter journey at 10 and 13 respectively, they literally grew up together!</p>
      <p>Who knows? Maybe they will still end up together!</p>
      <p>After all, at this time, they are both single.</p>
      <p>While chatting with British Vogue back in December, however, Emma told the news outlet that she was happy without a man in her life.</p>

      <p>‘I never believed the whole ‘I’m happy single’ spiel. I was like, ‘This is totally spiel.’ It took me a long time, but I am very happy [single]. I call it being self-partnered.’</p>
      <p>And it looks like Tom not only agreed but also adopted the term ‘self-partnered’, telling Daily Mail that ‘I like it! It’s the first I’ve heard of it, but it’s great. I’m in the same category, to be honest with you, quite happily self-partnered.’</p>
