        <b>Nollywood actress, Halima Abubakar, recently left social media users stunned, after she took to the platform to share a throwback photo of when she suffered from a skin condition that affected her face.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With the luxuries and advantages celebrities have, it appears many people often forget that they are humans and with problems of their own too.</p>
      <p>Halima recently shocked her fans and social media users after she took to her Instagram account to share a throwback video of herself, revealing the skin condition she had to battle with on her face.</p>
      <p>She wrote: <i>"Good morning beautiful people. I decided to post this video today, without shame or afraid of being ridiculed. I woke up in July last year to this. I don’t need any pity, cos some of you think you can break me. I own my sh*t. I lost friends, lover and was devastated. But this was last year. Only few people knew."</i></p>
