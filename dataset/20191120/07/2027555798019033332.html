      <h1>Syria downs Israeli missiles over Damascus: State media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:41:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Syrian anti-aircraft defences on Wednesday brought down missiles fired from "Israeli warplanes" over the capital Damascus, state media said.</p>
      <p>"At 1:20 am (2320 GMT) on Wednesday, Israeli warplanes... targeted the vicinity of the city of Damascus with a number of missiles," SANA news agency quoted a military source as saying.</p>
      <p>"Our air defence confronted the heavy attack and intercepted the hostile missiles, and was able to destroy most of them before reaching their targets."</p>
      <p>An AFP correspondent in Damascus heard several large explosions.</p>
      <p>SANA added that the aggression was carried out from "Lebanese and Palestinian territories".</p>
      <p>Israel sometimes launches its attacks on Syria from planes flying over neighbouring Lebanon.</p>
      <p>Since the start of Syria's war in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on the country's territory against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah targets.</p>
      <p>It comes after Israel's air defences intercepted four rockets fired from Syria on Tuesday morning, prompting reported retaliatory missile strikes.</p>
      <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Tuesday's rockets were fired from positions around the capital held by groups loyal to the Damascus government.</p>
      <p>The flare-up comes after a major escalation in and around Gaza last week following Israel's targeted killing of a commander of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Damascus.</p>
