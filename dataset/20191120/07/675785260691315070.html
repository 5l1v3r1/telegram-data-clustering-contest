      <h1>Jose Mourinho's comments on dealing with Christian Eriksen transfer at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been named as Tottenham's new manager and addressed the situation with out-of-contract players last month as a pundit on Sky Sports</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:17:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:17</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho suggested he would have sold Christian Eriksen and other <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> players whose contract were expiring.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been appointed as Mauricio Pochettino's successor, agreeing a three-and-a-half year deal in north London.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and United boss ends his stint as a Sky Sports pundit and will return to management after around 11 months out.</p>
      <p>During his time in the studio, Mourinho offered his verdict on Spurs and the current situation with out-of-contract players.</p>
      <p>Eriksen is the most high-profile of those who will be out of contract in the summer, alongside Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen.</p>

      <p>Asked last month how he would have addressed the situation, Mourinho said: "I don't like to keep players that don't want to stay at the club.</p>
      <p>"I think it is always really difficult. I am not thinking about the economical perspective, I mean from a motivational point of view.</p>
      <p>"We sold Robben to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a>, Chelsea didn't want to or need the money. But he didn't want to be there and wanted to go.</p>
      <p>"There are some moments where motivation affects performance and it is difficult to keep players happy when they have other dreams."</p>

      <p>Mourinho was also asked if Tottenham would have been a difficult club to manage this season, as found out by Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"I always felt the biggest investment Tottenham could do is what they did in previous seasons - which was keeping their best players," he added.</p>
      <p>"Some clubs, they can do both, they can keep their best players and buy other top players.</p>
      <p>"I think they showed clearly the group is fantastic with lots of young and English players.</p>
      <p>"Of course, they were very close to making history. Once more, they kept their best players, brought in Ndombele and Lo Celso.</p>
      <p>"I thought they would be ready for that challenge [for the title]."</p>
