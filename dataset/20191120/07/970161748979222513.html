      <p>Phone provider EE has announced new locations for the expansion of its 5G network.</p>
      <p>The company has detailed 14 new locations for the rollout around the UK including Liverpool, Glasgow and Huddersfield for the first time.</p>
      <p>The mobile operator said independent tests by network performance firm RootMetrics had also found its network now covered 60% of London.</p>
      <p>As part of the new expansion, EE said it had introduced 5G in Castlereagh, Guildford, Hamilton, Harlow, Hoddesdon, Kimberley, Lisburn, Maidstone, Sydenham, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/watford-fc/">Watford</a> and Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>5G is the next generation of mobile data network, offering speeds several times that of current-generation 4G.</p>

      <p>‘RootMetrics’ early 5G testing shows that we are a long way ahead in terms of 5G performance and our engineers are continuing to build new sites every day, on our journey to keeping our customers connected 100% of the time.’</p>
