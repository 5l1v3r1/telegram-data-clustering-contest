      <p>Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn were almost inseparable in the eyes of viewers after a <b><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/leaders-debate-boris-johnson-and-jeremy-corbyn-clash-over-the-union-1-5049043">series of heated exchanges</a></b> during the first televised debate of the General Election.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson edged a snap YouGov poll 51-49 although Labour figures were pleased with the showing of their leader in the prime-time ITV slot.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed over their rival plans for Brexit, with Mr Corbyn describing the Prime Minister's pledge to "get Brexit done" by the end of January as "nonsense", while Mr Johnson suggested his rival was "not fit to lead our country".</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn also accused the Government of entering into secret talks with the US to open the NHS to American pharmaceutical companies in a future trade deal.</p>

        <b>Nicola Sturgeon not impressed by either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon insisted she "wasn't impressed" with either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, as the Tory and Labour leaders clashed in the first TV debate of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon, who was mentioned several times in the debate despite not taking part in it, said she did not believe either man was fit to be PM "on the strength of these performances".<br/>Ms Sturgeon was not involved in the debate, organised by broadcasters ITV, after a legal challenge on Monday failed to win the party a place in the head-to-head contest</p>
      <p>She said afterwards: "The clear takeaway for Scotland from this debate is that neither of these men should be able to determine Scotland's future.<br/>"Jeremy Corbyn can't decide if he is leave or remain and Boris Johnson is determined to take Scotland out of the EU against our will."</p>

        <b>Conservative Party criticised over Twitter fact check stunt</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservative Party has faced criticism after one of its official Twitter accounts was rebranded as a fact checking service during the ITV leaders' debate.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account was renamed "factcheckUK" during Tuesday evening's ITV broadcast, offering commentary on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's statements and retweeting messages supporting Boris Johnson.</p>

      <p>The move was criticised by independent fact-checking charity Full Fact, which tweeted: "It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate.</p>
