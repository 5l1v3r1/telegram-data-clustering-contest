      <p>There are dramatic showdowns and dangerous situations unfolding in Coronation Street as a very dramatic week approaches. Brave Paul Foreman (Peter Ash) is ready to speak out about the abuse he suffered at the hands of evil Kel (Joseph Alessi) but as Kel is arrested, it leads to horror for Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove).</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the antics of nanny Jade Rowan (Lottie Henshall) continue to cause concern – but is she framing Hope when a fire takes hold in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fiz/">Fiz Stape</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennie-mcalpine/">Jennie McAlpine</a>) back yard? Meanwhile, Roy Cropper (David Neilson) faces tragedy as he is about to lose his new found brother Richard – and as much as he tries to help his niece Nina, it seems he is only making things worse.</p>
