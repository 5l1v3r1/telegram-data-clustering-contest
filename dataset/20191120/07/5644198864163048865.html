      <p>BARCELONA: Singapore hopes to be a “living laboratory” for developing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions globally - an ambition that plays to its strengths, according to Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative Vivian Balakrishnan.</p>
      <p>Dr Balakrishnan, who is also Foreign Affairs Minister, was speaking at the opening session of the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona on Tuesday (Nov 19), where he made a pitch for Singapore's attractiveness as an AI hub.</p>

      <p>For example, testing solutions in Singapore would be facilitated by agile regulations, as the country has just “a single layer of government”.</p>
      <p>“We understand science, technology, engineering. We get it and we're able to make decisions quickly, pivot instantly and seek opportunities that new technology will provide,” said Dr Balakrishnan. </p>
      <p>He added that the digitally literate population and “excellent first-world” digital infrastructure are key advantages.</p>
      <p>His pitch comes on the back of Singapore’s new National AI Strategy, which seeks to intensify AI development and deployment across the country.</p>

        <b>PROGRESS ON SMART NATION FASTER THAN EXPECTED</b>
      </p>
      <p>The plan is the next step of the country’s Smart Nation initiative, which kicked off five years ago in a bid to harness the benefits of digital technology.</p>
      <p>Speaking to CNA on the sidelines of the event, Dr Balakrishnan said Singapore has made good progress on these initiatives - in fact, “faster than what (he) anticipated”.</p>
      <p>However, efforts have to keep surging forward, as challenges lie ahead, especially when it comes to achieving the country’s bold AI ambitions.</p>
      <p>The biggest hurdle is a shortage of manpower with relevant and updated skills. </p>
      <p>“This gap is something which we need to fill urgently,” said Dr Balakrishnan.</p>
      <p>“Of course, we will also be part of a global network and we work with overseas partners but that is no replacement for having a hard core nucleus of Singaporeans on top of the game.”</p>
      <p>Another part of the equation that is still missing is “smart money” - or investors with deep expertise, he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Balakrishnan called for more venture capitalists, angel investors, and mentors “who have not just money, but networks and insights and perspective to share”.<b> </b></p>
      <p>
        <b>IMPORTANCE OF TAKING A HUMAN-CENTRIC APPROACH</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dr Balakrishnan also emphasised the importance of taking a human-centric approach, to ensure that new technology has a positive impact on people.</p>
      <p>He said: “The first paramount concern always has to be jobs, meaning what are the new jobs that I've created? … What skills, what education, what exposure will our own local Singaporeans need?”</p>
      <p>With privacy and safety at the forefront of discussions on AI, he also assured that Singapore is committed to ethics.</p>
      <p>This focus should not be seen as a “roadblock to development” but rather a “competitive advantage”, as good governance builds trust, he said.</p>
      <p>“You think about a car - if you didn't have brakes, you can't drive a very fast car.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>REMAINING OPEN IS KEY</b>
      </p>
      <p>When asked how US-China trade tensions would affect Singapore’s digital development goals, Dr Balakrishnan reiterated that Singapore’s attitude is to remain “open and inclusive and fair”.</p>
      <p>He added that there’s no telling “how things will pan out“.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime, there’s a need for small and medium-sized countries not to stay still and wait for this contest to be resolved, but to move forward,” he said.</p>
