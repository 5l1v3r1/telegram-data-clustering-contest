      <h1>Sales fall at Britain's Kingfisher as new boss starts</h1>

      <p>LONDON — British home improvement retailer Kingfisher on Wednesday reported another fall in underlying sales in its latest quarter, underlining the task facing its new boss.</p>
      <p>In September, Carrefour veteran Thierry Garnier succeeded Véronique Laury as chief executive of the group, whose main businesses are B&amp;Q and Screwfix in Britain and Castorama and Brico Depot in France.</p>
      <p>Kingfisher said its total sales fell 3.2% at constant currency to 3.0 billion pounds ($3.87 billion) in the three months to Oct. 31, its fiscal third quarter, while like-for-like sales fell 3.7%.</p>
      <p>It said the drop reflected continuing disruption from new range implementations, lower promotional activity and ongoing operational challenges in France, and softer market conditions in its main markets. ($1 = 0.7745 pounds) (Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton)</p>
