      <p>Arguably two of India’s most iconic film actors, Amitabh Bachchan and Rajnikant will open the festival. Films from Russia will take centre stage and movies by the acclaimed Japanese filmmaker, Takashi Miike, will be screened at the festival.</p>
      <p>Italian film "Despite the Fog", directed by renowned documentarian Goran Paskaljevic will kick things off at the festival. "Despite the Fog" is about one of those thousands of minor refugees without parental care wandering around Europe, half of them on Italian roads.</p>
