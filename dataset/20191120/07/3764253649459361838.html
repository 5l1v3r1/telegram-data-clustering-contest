      <p>Ugwu was recognised and honoured with an ICPC Integrity Award for her unwavering honesty and integrity displayed while carrying out her job as a former cleaner at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos.</p>
      <p>The award was presented to her by President Buhari on November 19, at the opening of the two-day National Summit on Diminishing Corruption in Public Sector held at the State House Banquet hall in Abuja.</p>
