      <h1>How Ballarat Cup fashion has changed in 10 years | flashback to 2009</h1>

      <p>Ten years is a long time in fashion, but looking back at Ballarat Cup Day 2009, it looks like most of the fashions could easily fit in at the 2019 edition to be held on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Thousands are expected to flock to the Ballarat Racecourse for the annual cup day and no doubt one of the most watched events will be the fillies and stallions in the fashions on the field in what is expected to be perfect weather for a day at the races.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Looking back to 2009, clearly it was a warm day, mini skirts everywhere and not a jacket to be seen.</p>
      <p>Bright colours were clearly the in-thing, different shades of pink, yellow, red and orange were the dominant looks and there's no reason to think it will be any different this year.</p>
      <p>Usually the men's fashion stays pretty much the same year-in, year-out, but lads, what on earth was going on with the white-rimmed sunglasses?</p>
      <p>Let's hope that's one fashion faux pas which is not repeated this week.</p>
      <p>And lads, here's another tip, remember your socks!</p>
