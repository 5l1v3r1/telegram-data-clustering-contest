      <p>Three men were recently arrested in Bali for their alleged possession and trafficking of ecstasy pills. Police in Denpasar said the incriminating evidence were acquired out of Bali and a further investigation is underway. </p>
      <p>“All the evidence we have seized were acquired outside of Bali, and police is amid investigating their network,” Ruddi Setiawan, who heads the Denpasar Police, said earlier today, as quoted in a statement. </p>
      <p>The three suspects have been identified as Agus, Arya and Wahyudi, who are 21, 32 and 27 years old, respectively. </p>
      <p>Police said they are not part of the same network, and had been arrested on separate occasions. Along with their arrests, police seized more than 1,800 ecstasy pills in total. </p>
      <p>According to authorities, the men were driven to dealing drugs in order to make more money. </p>
      <p>Under Indonesia’s 2009 Narcotics Law, the suspects individually face a maximum of 20 years in prison, if convicted.</p>
