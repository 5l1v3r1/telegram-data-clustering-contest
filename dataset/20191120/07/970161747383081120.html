        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lewis-capaldi/">Lewis Capaldi</a>’s new song was written about his aunt taking her own life.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Scottish star is following up the mammoth success of Someone You Loved and Hold Me While You Wait with Before You Go, which Lewis has called ‘one of the most personal songs I’ve ever written’.</p>
      <p>And the 23-year-old has shared the tragic inspiration behind the ballad – the aftermath of suicide for the victim’s loved ones.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio, Lewis explained: ‘The song’s kind of, it comes from a place of … it’s about suicide and it’s about not necessarily the act of it itself obviously, but people after it happens, the aftermath of it and people blaming themselves or starting to think, what could I have done to help that person? Or whatever.’</p>

      <p>He said: ‘When I was about five or six I think, my aunt committed suicide and just remember recently speaking to my mum about their feelings, her feelings about going through that sort of rigmarole in your head of, “What could I have done here? Could I have done anything?” Sort of thing.</p>
      <p>‘But she said it was the thing of, at first you’re angry. You’re obviously upset and then you kind of get angry at them, and then you get angry at yourself. She said it was this whole kind of … it’s very, very strange.’</p>
      <p>Before You Go features lyrics including: ‘So, before you go, was there something I could have said to make your heart beat better?’ and ‘It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless’.</p>
      <p>On Instagram, the singer said: ‘Seriously one of the most personal songs I’ve ever written. This song means a lot to me, but it will mean even more if it becomes successful.’</p>
      <p>Lewis is currently riding high after spending three weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100 in the US with Someone You Loved.</p>
      <p>The star’s debut album Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent is the best-selling album by a British artist in over eight years, and reached number one on the UK, Scottish and Irish charts.</p>
