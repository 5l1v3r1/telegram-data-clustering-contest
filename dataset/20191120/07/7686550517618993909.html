      <p>Tickets to fly from the UK to Australia are on sale this week for just over £200 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Australian carrier Qantas.</p>
      <p>The airline is selling return tickets between London and Sydney for £205.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "For 100 hours only, we'll be releasing 100 Golden Tickets. From midday each day, there'll be 20 Golden Tickets from London Heathrow to Sydney, for just £205 Economy return.</p>
      <p>"Plus, check out our Centenary Sale fares to Melbourne, Perth and Sydney from £699 Economy return."</p>
      <p>The sale started on Monday and runs until Friday, November 22, with 20 tickets released each day at midday.</p>
      <p>The sale also has cheap flights to Bangkok, Singapore, Bali, Phuket, Brisbane and Auckland starting at £483 return.</p>
      <p>Other celebrations for the anniversaryu include special livery on a new Dreamliner that will be seen at airports around the world, featuring every Qantas logo since 1920; a $1 coin to mark the 100th that will enter circulation next year; and a touring exhibition that will visit a number of cities around Australia.</p>
      <p>Qantas Chairman Richard Goyder said: “Qantas is a national icon because it’s been such a big part of Australian life for so long.</p>
      <p>“We started in outback Queensland carrying mail and a few passengers in the 1920s. We grew as Australia grew, and we’ve had important support roles during wars, national disasters and celebrations. Our founders talked about overcoming the tyranny of distance and through the years we’ve moved from bi-planes, to single wing, to jets to help bring things closer,” added Mr Goyder.</p>
      <p>Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said: “Almost a century after our first flight, Qantas and Jetstar carry more than 50 million people around this country and the globe each year. I’m sure that would amaze our three founders, who held the early board meetings of this company at the local tailor’s shop because it was the longest table they could find.”</p>
      <p>“A lot of Australians saw the world for the first time on a flying kangaroo. And a lot of migrants started their life in Australia when they first stepped on a Qantas plane.</p>
      <p>“There are so many amazing Qantas stories that also tell the story of modern Australia. We want our centenary to be a celebration of those stories as well as how we’ll be part of taking the spirit of Australia further in the years ahead,” added Mr Joyce.</p>
      <p>The new 787 Centenary livery aircraft will fly across key Qantas international destinations, including Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and London. Named Longreach after the Queensland town that was key to the airline’s origins, it joins nine other Qantas 787s that are all named after things that are iconically Australian, including <i>Skippy, Great Southern Land, Waltzing Matilda</i> and <i>Jillaroo</i> .</p>
      <p>The Royal Australian Mint will produce approximately 5 million limited edition one-dollar coins to be used in Australia for every day cash transactions, which will go into general circulation from February 2020.</p>
      <p>For collectors, there is an eleven-piece collection set featuring key milestones and images of aircraft from across the decades including the Avro, Catalina Flying Boat, Boeing 707 and 747 and the A380. The centrepiece is a Kangaroo copper coin similar to the original Australian penny, which inspired Qantas’ iconic Kangaroo symbol.
