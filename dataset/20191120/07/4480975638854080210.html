      <h1>China wants a deal but is prepared for prolonged trade war – Global Times</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:46:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p> Hu Xijin, the Editor-in-chief of Chinese and English editions of the Global Times, tweeted out last minutes: “Few Chinese believe that China and the US can reach a deal soon. Given the current poor China policy of the US, people tend to believe the significance of a trade deal, if reached, will be limited. China wants a deal but is prepared for the worst-case scenario, a prolonged trade war.”</p>
      <p>His comments come after US President Trump said on Tuesday that China would have to make a deal he likes and threatened to raise tariffs further if no trade deal is reached with China.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Meanwhile, the US-China political tensions over the Hong Kong human rights bill pose a near-term risk for the markets, with China reiterating retaliation against the US’ interference in its internal affairs. USD/JPY is seeing a fresh leg lower and heads towards day’s low of 108.36.</p>
