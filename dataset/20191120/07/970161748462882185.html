      <p>A dog owner has been jailed for over five months after he was caught on camera repeatedly punching his pet.</p>
      <p>Robert Black was given the 23-week sentence at Reading Magistrates’ Court for causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.</p>
      <p>A witness saw him beating his dog in Victoria Park, Newbury, Berkshire, on December 21 last year so contacted police.</p>
      <p>He was arrested soon after and CCTV caught the moment that he attacked the mixed-breed dog.</p>

      <p>Black appears to have reacted when his pet tussled with other dogs in the park.</p>

      <p>PC David Burleigh said: ‘Black demonstrated significant cruelty to his dog by punching it several times in the face, with no concern for its welfare.</p>
      <p>‘This behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable for a pet owner and I am pleased that not only has he received a prison sentence for his actions, but that he has been banned from owning animals for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>‘We take reports such as these seriously and will look to investigate and take action against anyone who carries out this type of offence.’</p>
      <p>Black has also been banned from owning animals for 10 years and his two dogs have been rehomed.</p>
