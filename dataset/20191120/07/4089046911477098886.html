      <p>Kerry Bremer met Jake Manning, who has Down syndrome, and his single mother, Jean Manning, more than four years ago. The teacher knew Jake’s mom was battling terminal breast cancer.</p>
      <p>"I fell in love with him instantly, and as she got sicker that year, I just thought, ‘What is she going to do?’” Kerry Bremer said.</p>
      <p>After talking to her husband and their three children, Kerry Bremer made Manning an offer, mom-to-mom, to take care of Jake, should it be needed.</p>
      <p>"If you need a backup plan for Jake, then our family is happy to make him part of our family. And she said, ‘I'll sleep better tonight than I’ve slept in a long time,’” Kerry Bremer said.</p>
      <p>Jake spent the next few years getting to know the Bremer family, sharing weekends and holidays. Kerry Bremer’s husband, Dave, and children – Kaitlyn, Kristen and Jonathan – quickly embraced Jake’s loving and joyful nature.</p>
      <p>"When I first met him, back when he was in Kerry’s class, it was fun. But when we first decided to do this and I met him, it was "You’re dad? You’re Dave the dad?’ And that was it. For a very long time, I was Dave the dad,” Dave Bremer said.</p>
      <p>Manning died last Wednesday. She took a nap after a chemotherapy treatment and never woke up. The Bremers are now Jake’s guardians.</p>
      <p>"My mom went to heaven," Jake said. "She's always in my heart. She loves me so much."</p>
      <p>Jake is thankful that his second family was there for him when he needed them most. However, Kerry Bremer says Manning is the real hero: a dying mother who selflessly prepared her son for a safe and loving future.</p>
      <p>"We shared our boy, and she will live on here in this house,” Kerry Bremer said.</p>
      <p>Friends of Manning have set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/memorial-for-jeanie-to-benefit-jake?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=m_pd%20share-sheet&amp;fbclid=IwAR3JIPKVWHZrVa3kCh36G1FprVbrnm3CdNF5vQHXak8DFrl1i-D8U2zrhEw">GoFundMe</a> page to help support Jake and the Bremer family. It has raised more than $25,000.</p>
