        <b>Tottenham legend Gary Lineker slammed the club for sacking Mauricio Pochettino, claiming that they won’t find a better replacement for him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine’s five-year spell at Spurs ended with 159 wins out of 293 matches. Tottenham have had a disappointing run of form this season as they are currently 14th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Lineker who had a pretty successful spell at the club, wrote on Twitter that they will have a hard time finding a better replacement for Pochettino. The former England international wrote: “Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by @SpursOfficial. He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement….ain’t gonna happen.”</p>

      <p>Tottenham may have been in a bad situation but they could’ve tried keeping Pochettino a little longer. The club has appointed Jose Mourinho as their new manager and it’ll be interesting to see how the Portuguese fares there.</p>
      <p>His first game in charge is against West Ham on Saturday. A win for Spurs could see them move to the top ten of the Premier League table.</p>
