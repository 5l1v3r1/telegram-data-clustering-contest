      <h1>Taiwan IPC firms expanding capacity locally</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:30:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ninelu Tu, Taipei; Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Several Industrial PC (IPC) firms are planning to expand their capacities in Taiwan to cope with the US-China trade tensions, according to sources from the upstream supply chain.</p>
      <p>So far Advantech, Adlink Technology, Ibase Technology, Ibase Gaming and Winmate have already begun making preparations, while some others such as Parpro will move their production lines to America in a bid to provide faster and better services to its clients there, the sources said.</p>
      <p>In addition to Taiwan, Advantech will continue its investments in China for some specific domestic industries and any potential business opportunities.</p>
      <p>Advantech will begin constructing a new building at a production base in Taiwan at the end of 2019 or early 2020. The company is also set to expand its building in Beijing, China for software R&amp;D.</p>
      <p>Adlink is currently planning to expand its capacity and R&amp;D investment in Taiwan with related details to be confirmed internally at the end of 2019 or early 2020.</p>
      <p>Winmate, which is already conducting most of its manufacturing in Taiwan, is also set to establish new smart factories locally, to strive for orders transferred from China and for future operation needs.</p>
      <p>Ibase Gaming, which is a supplier of gambling machines, has seen weakening growth in orders due to slow growth in the number of new casinos. The company has turned to power storage applications for growth, but the business is heavily affected by the trade dispute between the US and China, and therefore, the company has decided to expand capacity in Taiwan to satisfy demand. Ibase Technology, which sees similar issues in the network communication product market, is also doing the same.</p>
      <p>Parpro has sold its plants in Taiwan that have weak utilization rates and then rented them back to produce some of its high-end IPC products. The company has shifted a majority of production to its Mexico facilities, which will be responsible for its new orders from a fast-food restaurant chain in the US and orders for aerospace and military applications. The benefit from the production relocation is expected to show starting 2020.</p>
