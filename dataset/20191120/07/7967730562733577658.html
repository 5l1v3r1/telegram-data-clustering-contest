      <h1>Former Wallaby calls for drastic changes at the top of Rugby Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:45:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Phillips</a></address>
      <p>The man behind the latest push for new leadership at the top of Rugby Australia says he has not spoken to a single former Wallaby who does not think drastic change is needed to address the game’s decline.</p>
      <p>Dick Marks received hundreds of responses within a few hours of launching the #LetsFixAustralianRugby campaign, in which the former Wallaby identified 12 recent "mistakes", which came to a head with a quarter-final defeat to Eddie Jones' England at the World Cup.</p>

      <p>Those "mistakes" included "making Ewen McKenzie the virtual CEO of the Wallabies", the removal of the Western Force from Super Rugby, the format of the NRC, a "quick fix" mentality that led to the appointment of Robbie Deans and several issues relating to pathways and the development of the next generation of players.</p>
      <p>Marks also offered some solutions.</p>
      <p>He wants to establish a "war cabinet" that would conduct a comprehensive review of the Australian rugby landscape and launch four sub-committees to take control of the code throughout the nation.</p>
      <p>A ‘‘technical committee’’ would review the player, coach and competition structures; a ‘‘community rugby committee’’ would assess the schoolboy and club rugby scene and work out how to better integrate grassroots with the NRC; a ‘‘finance committee’’ would try and whip the game’s bottom line into shape; and a ‘‘constitutional committee’’ would rewrite the game’s governance framework.</p>
      <p>The 17-Test Wallaby told the <i>Herald </i>there are many reasons he has put his name to the latest participant-based push to change the leadership at the top of RA.</p>
      <p>The first of those reasons is to stop the emphasis on quick fixes. That includes the appointment of new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie.</p>
      <p>"The goal is to create a mechanism by which the entire system can be properly reviewed, which essentially has to be done by committees of knowledgeable people," Marks said.</p>
      <p>"Quick fixes, like getting a foreign national team coach, don’t work.</p>
      <p>"The trouble with foreign coaches is that they come, they get paid lots of money and then they go leaving a very small legacy behind, if any.</p>
      <p>"If we lack knowledge in this country it is far better to appoint an intelligent person who can be assisted in seeking it wherever it exists.</p>
      <p>"Appointing foreign coaches indicates we have a poor coach education system and sends a very bad message to aspiring Australians."</p>
      <p>In Marks' eyes, the abolishment of the National Coaching Committee in 1996 was the beginning of the end for rugby in Australia.</p>

      <p>Bob Dwyer, Rod Macqueen and Alan Jones were all pupils of that system.</p>
      <p>RA promised to bring a similar pathway for coaches back in 2017, but Marks says that has not eventuated.</p>
      <p>"We had a great system which won us two Rugby World Cups and produced Alan Jones, Bob Dwyer and Rod Macqueen," Marks said.</p>
      <p>"The emasculation of the system and the shutting down of the National Coaching Committee was the beginning of the end.</p>
      <p>"Do people realise that RA promised to resurrect the committee and even appointed Roger Gould as the chairman?</p>
      <p>"But that’s where it ended – they never gave him one member of the committee and that’s an example of why we have the wrong people running the game."</p>
      <p>The establishment of the constitution recommended by Mark Arbib in October 2012 was the other sign a decline in on-field and off-field performance was imminent, Marks says.</p>
      <p>"The Arbib constitution is a disaster and the results over the last six years since it was adopted prove it," Marks said.</p>
      <p>"You can’t get the right people under its clauses. This nominations committee decides who is qualified and requires a prescribed skills set.</p>

      <p>"The two best treasurers in my time were Paul Keating and Peter Costello. One was a rock band manager and the other was a lawyer with no financial qualifications, meaning that neither would have got a look in under this prescribed policy."</p>
      <p>Marks insists there is not one Wallaby he has spoken to who disagrees with his detailed open letter.</p>
      <p>"Without mentioning names, I have not spoken to one Wallaby who doesn’t agree with me, nor one of our coaching luminaries," he said.</p>
      <p>Rugby Australia declined a request for comment.</p>
