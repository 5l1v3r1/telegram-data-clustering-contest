      <p>Australian poker machine giant Aristocrat Leisure says it will continue to cash in on its booming online computer game business, which now accounts for 41 per cent of its revenue, as new games reach a critical mass of players and give it the space to pull back on marketing.</p>
      <p>Growth from mobile games, including the popular <i>War of Clans</i> and <i>RAID: Shadow League </i>titles, helped the $21 billion ASX-listed group ramp up its normalised full-year profit after tax by 22 per cent to $752 million, the company said on Wednesday.</p>

      <p>The result, also helped by pokies sales growth in North America and favourable currency movements, topped market expectations, sending its share price 6 per cent higher to close at $33.71.</p>
      <p>Aristocrat's online games – which are free to play but make money through in-app purchases – delivered $US1.25 billion ($1.83 billion) in revenue for the 12 months to September 30, a lift of 24 per cent.</p>
      <p>That is almost as much as flowed through its entire US "land-based" operations, but it booked about half as much profit ($US370 million versus $US750 million) as it spent up big on marketing.</p>

      <p>Aristocrat chief executive Trevor Croker said the company had learnt valuable insights from the launch of <i>RAID: Shadow League,</i> its first role-playing game, which players become "highly committed" to provided the company continued to make improvements.</p>
      <p>“The investment is now to acquire good users early ... then you can wind back the [user aquisition] spend as you get more mature and they continue to play and stay in the game," Mr Croker said.</p>
      <p>Digital casino games - where players can buy virtual chips and the play card games or digital version of some of Aristocrat's poker machines - were softening however, with revenue falling about 1 per cent in the second half.</p>
      <p>Mr Croker said those products could be improved by introducing more features from Aristocrat's physical gambling units into its digital games.</p>

      <p>Group-wide revenue rose 22.7 per cent to $4.4 billion. Machine sales in the Americas lifted 14 per cent in US dollar terms to $US1.36 billion, while revenue was flat in Australia, New Zealand at $455 million, and fell 7 per cent to $195 million in other markets.</p>
      <p>The company’s normalised net profit after tax in constant currency was up 14 per cent, and statutory profit was up 29 per cent to $699 million.</p>
      <p>Aristocrat declared a full-year dividend of 56¢ per share, an increase of 10¢ from last year.</p>
      <p>With a strengthening balance sheet, Aristocrat's chief financial officer Julie Cameron-Doe said management and the board were in "active dialogue" about the need for capital management, such as buybacks.</p>
      <p>“Absent any significant M&amp;A then we will certainly come back with more to talk about in terms of capital management," Ms Cameron-Doe said.</p>
      <p>Macquarie analysts said the result beat the consensus forecast of analysts covering the company by 3 per cent.</p>
      <p>“Digital delivered a much better result than we had expected … and was the driver behind the beat,” Macquarie analysts David Fabris said.</p>
