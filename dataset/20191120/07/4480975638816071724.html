      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> is trading above 1.1050, looking for a new direction as US-Sino tensions rise around the Senate's bill supporting Hong Kong protesters. How is it positioned on the chart?</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">Technical Confluences Indicator</a> is showing that EUR/USD is capped around <b>1.1080</b>, which is a dense cluster including the Simple Moving Average 10-1h, the Bollinger Band 1h-Middle, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the SMA 5-4h, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 1, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the BB 1h-Upper, and the previous daily high. </p>

      <p>Below, support awaits at <b>1.1045</b>, which is the confluence of the PP 1d-S3, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-week, the SMA 50-1d, the SMA 5-1d, the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day, and the SMA 100-1h. </p>

      <h3>Confluence Detector</h3>
      <p>The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a <b>congestion of indicators,</b> moving averages, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci levels</a>, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.</p>
      <p>This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin">price level without any indicator</a> or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.</p>
