        <b>With Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz’s friendship going for a toss, their fans too have parted ways. Now, Sidharth’s fans want Asim to be thrown out of the Bigg Boss 13 house!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz’s friendship during the first month of Bigg Boss 13 had been the talk of the town. The two always stood beside each other and were hailed as the ‘Jai-Veeru’ of the house by host Salman Khan. However, in the last few episodes, viewers have been constantly coming across their ugly clashes on the pettiest of issues. The most recent fight between Sidharth and Asim got nastier, as the duo was this close to getting into a physical brawl and the housemates had to intervene and separate them.</p>
      <p>Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla’s enmity has also divided their fans on social media, so much so, that all the Shukla fans demanded Asim’s eviction from the Bigg Boss 13 house. Yes, you read that right! The trend-list on Twitter is currently seeing #EvictAsimRiaz as one of the top hash-tags. As per them, Asim crossed all the limits and was getting violent with the housemates. “Immediate action needs to be taken because this person is harmful and violent for all people be it a friend or an enemy. #EvictAsimRia #StayStrongSidharth,” wrote a user, while another wrote, “So much of arrogance and overconfident #EvictAsimRiaz.” (ALSO READ -<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-sidharth-shukla-asim-riaz-turn-enemies-stay-strong-sid-shukla-and-we-stand-by-asim-trends/5dd4d07687fb571eff7e4215"> Bigg Boss 13: Sidharth Shukla-Asim Riaz Turn Enemies; 'Stay Strong Sid Shukla' And 'We Stand By Asim' Trends</a>)</p>

      <p>It all started during the Shehnaaz Ka Swayamwar task. During which, Sana demanded fruits from Sidharth’s team. While the Balika Vadhu actor wanted to get her oranges, Asim decided to take apples for her father, essayed by Hindustani Bhau. Well, this gave birth to a lot of mess and saw Sidharth-Asim locking horns like there’s no tomorrow. As a consequence of the same, it looks like Asim, Shefali and Himanshi have formed their separate group and ditched Sidharth.</p>
