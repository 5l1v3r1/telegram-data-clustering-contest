      <h1>This Is the Only Side Hustle that Belongs on Your Resume</h1>
      <h2>Corporate recruiters generally frown on "extracurricular" businesses, but there is one huge exception.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:34:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:34</time> by <a rel="author">Geoffrey James</a></address>
      <p>About 57 percent of Americans have a "<a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/surprise-gig-workers-are-getting-shafted-on-tax-day.html">side hustle</a>" of some kind, according to a recent and widely-quoted <a href="https://www.dollarsprout.com/side-hustle-statistics/">survey from the financial firm DollarSprout</a>. People have side hustles for a variety of reasons: a <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/9-ways-millennials-can-get-a-dream-job.html">low-paid day job</a>, student loans, and even <a href="https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/no-uber-drivers-are-not-entrepreneurs.html">bootstrapping a startup</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's the thing, though. Recruiters don't want to hire--and companies are less interested in retaining--candidates and employees who are side hustlers. They expect employees to be "1,000 percent committed to their day job, working super-long hours and then spend what little time remains recharging... so the employee can hit the ground running next day.</p>
      <p>For that reason, it's smart to keep your side hustle off your resume. However, according to <a href="https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/">recent research conducted by TheKnowledgeAcademy.com</a>, fully 85 percent of corporate recruiters think one particular side hustle makes you a more attractive candidate:<i> "buying items from garage sales and then selling them online for a higher price.</i>"</p>
      <p>Why is this side hustle not just acceptable but even desirable when most other side hustles are strictly <i>pursuita-non-grata</i>? Three reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><i>It feels more like a hobby than a side hustle.</i> Hitting the local garage sales sounds relaxing, like antique-hunting or collecting garden gnomes. Thus while you might actually be making serious money, your employer sees the activity as something that helps you recuperate rather than help burn you out.</li>
        <li><i>It doesn't sound time-consuming. </i>Garage sales are mostly weekend activities and how much time does it take to write an eBay ad, throw something in a box, and mail it to Sheboygan? Thus while some folks are probably making big bucks reselling garage sale finds, there's a limit to how big it can scale.</li>
        <li><i>It develops your sales and marketing skills.</i> Buying random items cheap and selling them with a markup is what capitalism is all about. Employers sense that this particular side hustle is almost like giving you sales training. You'll develop skill that they'll probably be able to put to good use.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In short, unlike most side hustles, "buying items from garage sales and selling them online is" is both non-threatening to your day and even promises to benefit them by providing you with free training. That's why it's a net plus on your resume.</p>
