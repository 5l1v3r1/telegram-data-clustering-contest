      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/holytown-mma-fighter-chris-bungard-20749604">Holytown MMA star Chris Bungard</a> says he has no fear over facing an unknown opponent this weekend in London.</p>
      <p>The lightweight had been scheduled to clash with Mario Saeed at the O2 Arena for Bellator on November 23 but the Englishman has dropped out through injury.</p>
      <p>Benjamin ‘El Skeletto’ Brander has now been drafted in as a late replacement for the 30-year-old.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Swiss grappler enters the cage for the first time in 19 months to make his Bellator debut against the Scot.</p>
      <p>Bungard, who has spent the last week in Brazil working with his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/scots-ufc-star-paul-bearjew-20385481">Scottish Hit Squad</a> stable-mate and UFC fighter Paul Craig, admits he doesn’t know much about his foe – but won’t change his game plan.</p>
      <p>He said: “I didn’t know who he was until I got matched with him.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure he will be well-schooled and this is the biggest fight of his life. I’m not sure what shape he will be in taking this fight at such short notice but it’s for me to make sure I go in there and do well.</p>
      <p>“From watching clips of him it’s definitely a different opponent, but with just a couple of weeks notice I can’t change much about my camp. I’m in good shape and I’ll focus on what I’m good at.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/scots-mma-star-tips-pal-20721393">Bungard is still optimistic</a> of clashing with Saeed and is hoping to take him back to the Hydro next year.</p>
      <p>“There is a bit of frustration,” he continued. “I had been looking forward to fighting Mario.</p>
      <p>“There was a bit of heat between us but he’s pulled out with a sore rib.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It doesn’t really change what I do, it’s just part of the fight game.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure the fight will happen. I need to keep the momentum going, and I want to bring Bellator up the road to the Hydro.</p>
      <p>“That’s my ultimate goal, to take it back to Scotland. Mario has a good following, and so do I. I think that card would sell well.</p>
      <p>“I’d be hoping if we got another go he doesn’t decide to pull out at the last second.”</p>
