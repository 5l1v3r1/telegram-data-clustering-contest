      <h1>Jose Mourinho's Tottenham prediction highlights how far they have fallen</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho claimed Tottenham were capable of mounting a Premier League title challenge this season, but he takes over with them down in 14th spot</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:42:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> believed Tottenham were one of four teams who could have challenged for the Premier League title this season.</p>
      <p>Instead, the new Spurs boss inherits a side languishing down in the bottom half, 20 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Special One faces a huge task to get Tottenham back among the Champions League spots as they also trail fourth-placed Manchester City by 11 points.</p>
      <p>And during his punditry debut for Sky Sports earlier this season, Mourinho believed they were good enough to compete for top honours.</p>
      <p>When asked how many clubs could challenge for the title, he replied: "Four. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and Manchester City B team."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/tottenham-agree-deal-jose-mourinho-20919264">Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino at the helm</a> after Daniel Levy decided to wield the axe on the Argentine.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," said Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>

      <p>Levy has explained why he turned to Mourinho, who returns to the dugout 11 months after leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>He said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician.</p>
      <p>"He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Jamie Carragher believes Mourinho is just the type of manager Spurs need to change their fortunes.</p>
      <p>He told <i>Sky Sports News</i> : "You look at his C.V., people question the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> job, but you have to look at his career as a whole.</p>
      <p>“He’s been hugely successful and that is the one thing Tottenham lack at this moment, no matter how well Pochettino’s done.</p>
      <p>“They haven’t quite got over the line in getting a trophy and normally that’s what Jose Mourinho does when he goes to a club.”</p>
