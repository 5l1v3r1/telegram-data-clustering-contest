      <h1>Rapid increase in food prices temporary – Emefiele  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:54:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/titobioluwa-okunade/" target="_blank">Titobioluwa Okunade</a></address>
      <p>Mr Godwin Emefiele, the Governor of the <b>Central Bank of Nigeria</b> (CBN) has disclosed that the rapid increase in food prices and all other products, excluding farm produce, is momentary and will reverse aggressively in another three to four months.</p>
      <p><b>The CBN disclosed this</b> after the publication of the National Bureau of Statistics’ (NBS), inflation report for the month of October which reflects inflation figures at a 17-month high, from 11.24% in September to 11.61% in October.</p>
      <p><b>According to <a href="https://www.channelstv.com/2019/11/19/border-closure-inflation-to-moderate-in-three-months-says-emefiele/">Channels Television</a></b>, Mr. Emefiele stated that the attribution of the rise in food prices and all other goods to the border closure is true but the benefits outweigh the temporary rise in prices.</p>

      <p>“<i>Inflation goes up from 11.22 to 11.61 between September and October, and mainly it’s because of the border closure</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>Mr Emefiele</b>, after admitting that the border closure led to shortfalls in the supply of goods as a result of local production not meeting up with the market demands and the non-existence of dumped goods from other countries, said it is still Nigerian farmers and car dealers that are benefitting from the price increase.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“<i>I am not going to entirely disagree that yes, because of border closure that has resulted in some supply shortages because of goods that are being dumped into the country.</i></p>
      <p><i>“Who are those benefitting, in as much as I don’t like the fact that prices went up momentarily from September and October, the beneficiaries are Nigerians and companies where we have seen a situation where people have jobs, farmers who produce poultry and those benefitting from import of cars legitimately</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>However, the CBN Governor</b> reportedly expressed his irritation at the inflationary pressure but was quick to assure that the trend would witness an immediate downward trend.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“In as much as I do not like the fact that the inflationary pressures are coming up right now, I’m also saying that it will moderate and very quickly, maximum of another 3 to 4 months aggressively downwards.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, how long can Nigerians endure increased inflationary pressure and a shortened supply of goods within the economy, as the implications of the border closure take its toll on businesses and individuals?</p>
      <p><b>The recent events</b> with the popular eatery, Chicken Republic running out of chickens to sell to its customers, as earlier published by <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/18/nigerians-react-as-some-chicken-republic-outlets-go-out-of-stock-for-chicken/">Nairametrics</a>, might not be unrelated to the happening at the Nigerian land borders.</p>
