      <h1>Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel continue rally for fourth consecutive session</h1>
      <h2>Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Monday announced a hike in mobile phone call and data charges.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:15:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Shares of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel remained in heavy demand on Wednesday, with the former surging up to 32%, after announcing a hike in mobile phone call and data charges from December.</p>
      <p>Vodafone Idea shares zoomed 31.72% to ₹7.93 on the BSE. This is the fourth consecutive day of rise in Vodafone Idea shares. During this time, the scrip has more than doubled.</p>
      <p>Bharti Airtel also rose 3.11% to hit its 52-week high of ₹452.95, registering its fourth consecutive day of gain. In four days, the stock has gained 24.90%.</p>
      <p>Faced with intense competition and unprecedented statutory dues, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Monday announced a hike in mobile phone call and data charges from December saying the increase was warranted for viability of their business.</p>
      <p>“To ensure that its customers continue to enjoy world class digital experiences, Vodafone Idea will suitably increase the prices of its tariffs effective December 1, 2019,” Vodafone Idea had said.</p>
      <p>The telecom sector is highly capital-intensive with fast-changing technology cycles that require continuing investments, Bharti Airtel said.</p>
      <p>“It is, therefore, extremely important that the industry remains viable to support the vision of Digital India. Accordingly, Airtel will appropriately increase price offerings in the month beginning December,” it added.</p>
