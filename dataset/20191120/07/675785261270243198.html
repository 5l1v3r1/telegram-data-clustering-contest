      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:44:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho outlined the Tottenham Hotspur players he'd like to have signed for Manchester United shortly before he got the Old Trafford axe last year.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and United boss was appointed as the new Spurs manager on a three-and-a-half year deal on Wednesday morning, replacing the sacked Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>It is his first job since his departure from United in December last year, and in interview shortly before his departure he used Spurs as an example of a club who possess players clubs like United could no longer buy.</p>
      <p>"Is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> by history, by its dimensions, bigger than <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ? With all the respect - Tottenham is an amazing club - I think everybody would say yes." he said, via the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-news-jose-mourinho-16822877">Daily Star</a>.</p>

      <p>"Can we go to Tottenham and buy their best players? No - because they don't sell or because they are so powerful that they can say no.</p>
      <p>"A few years ago, who was Tottenham's best player? Michael Carrick (who joined United).</p>
      <p>"A few years later, who was the best player? Berbatov (who also moved to Old Trafford).</p>
      <p>"Can we go now there and bring Harry Kane, Dele Alli, [Christian] Eriksen, [Heung-min] Son? Can we go there and bring the guys here? No.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"So, who is more powerful now. Them or us?"</p>
      <p>Mourinho claimed that the fact United couldn't sign Spurs players was evidence of a power shift in football.</p>
      <p>"Football changes," he added. "It is more difficult to buy players of a high, high, high level.</p>
      <p>"The clubs are more powerful and don't want to sell.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"Before, the smaller clubs, they were almost begging the big clubs, 'get my best player, I need to sell. Please, you are powerful, buy my best player'.</p>
      <p>"At this moment, they don't want to sell.</p>
      <p>"It is more difficult to make the team better and stronger with buying.</p>

      <p>"Unless you do what some clubs do, and for some reason they can do and others cannot.</p>
      <p>"Which is, I need a right back and a left back. Send away the ones you have and buy four at the same time.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult, so we do what we can.”</p>
