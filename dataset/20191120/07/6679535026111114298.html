      <p>Can cooks be replaced with machines? A startup in Chennai is attempting to answer that question.</p>
      <p>“We have pre-programmed nearly 600 dishes into it,” says Saravanan Sundaramoorthy, CEO and founder, Robochef. The “it” he is referring to is not a humanoid. Robochef is a massive stainless steel structure, which looks like unwieldy kitchen equipment with very little visually pleasing detail.</p>
      <p>Inside Robochef, moving belts that carry utensils, and containers that deliver spices and vegetables into the main cooking vessel, are operated by sensors tuned using computer codes.</p>
      <p>Robochef is currently a ghost kitchen (a kitchen set up for preparing delivery-only meals). “We have tied up with caterers who supply in bulk to events and hotels. Our product has helped them improve their gains, and takes out the dependency on a cook,” says Saravanan.</p>
      <p>There are two variants of the machine — the commercial variant priced at ₹45 lakh, meant for commercial ghost kitchens, and the domestic variant priced at ₹6 lakh.</p>
