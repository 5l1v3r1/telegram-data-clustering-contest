      <h1>Verstappen 'very popular' in Brazil - Barrichello</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-verstappen/"><b>Max Verstappen</b></a> has become "very popular" in Brazil, according to former F1 driver Rubens Barrichello.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:04:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:04</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>Once strongly represented in F1, featuring legends like Ayrton Senna and Nelson Piquet and multiple race winners including Barrichello and Felipe Massa, there is no longer a single Brazilian driver on the grid.</p>
      <p>But Barrichello says the Brazilian people are now turning their attention to Dutchman Verstappen.</p>
      <p>"Max is an aggressive driver," he told De Telegraaf newspaper.</p>
      <p>"People think he's crazy. He is also very outspoken. He says what he thinks. His weekend in Brazil was ten out of ten.</p>
      <p>"It all makes him a very popular driver in Brazil."</p>
      <p>With a very similar view about 22-year-old Verstappen is 1997 world champion <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jacques-villeneuve/"><b>Jacques Villeneuve</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion he is ready to become world champion," the Canadian told Sky Italia.</p>
      <p>"But that doesn't mean he doesn't have to be careful with what he says."</p>
      <p>Villeneuve therefore scolded Verstappen for recently accusing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> of "cheating" with its engine.</p>
      <p>"In that case, he was talking about something he cannot know about," he said. "That is the whole problem with that statement."</p>
