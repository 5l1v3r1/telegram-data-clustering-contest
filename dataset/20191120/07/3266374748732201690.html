      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Manchester United, Arsenal interested in Brad Young</h1>

      <h3>Manchester United and Arsenal are reportedly interested in and keeping tabs on young goalkeeper Brad Young, who is currently plying his trade for Hartlepool.</h3>
      <p>As per <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364285/man-utd-arsenal-hartlepool-brad-young/">The Sun</a>, Brad Young is already garnering attention from the English top-flight. Premier League giants Manchester United and Arsenal are interested in the Hartlepool youngster and are keeping a close eye on the goalkeeper’s form and improvement over the games.</p>
      <p>Brad Young has earned a England youth call-up after impressing at club level for Hartlepool. Having only signed a professional contract with the National League club, Young stands 191 cm tall and is an imposing presence in the box. Yet to have his senior debut for Hartlepool, the 17-year-old is being chased by the likes of Arsenal and Manchester United.</p>

      <p>Arsenal have promising young goalkeepers in their youth setup, with the primary prospect being Karl Hein from Estonia, who was a former Manchester United target before joining the Gunners in 2018. Hein recently signed a professional deal and is touted as a future promise at the club.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have had their own fair share of goalkeepers emanating from the academy. The most high-profile one right now is Dean Henderson, who is currently earning plaudits keeping the goal for Sheffield United in the Premier League. The United loanee is billed to take over from David de Gea at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>In the youth setup, Manchester United have Matej Kovar, who has caught attention due to his performances and potential.</p>

      <p>Still, clubs of the stature of Arsenal and Manchester United are always on the lookout for brilliant youth prospects to bring over, especially with the respective prospects Hein and Kovar promoted to the Under-23s and likely to be either loaned out or promoted further to the first-team setup by summer 2020.</p>
      <p>While interest from Arsenal and Manchester United is a good sign for Hartlepool and Brad Young, the 17-year-old’s primary focus would be on making the senior grade at Hartlepool first and grab some invaluable first-team experience, hopefully before the end of the 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>United and Arsenal will likely continue to keep a check on Brad Young and how he develops over the course of the season. A move though, does not seem to be on the cards just now.</p>
