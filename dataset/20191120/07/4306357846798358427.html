      <h3>Willian is keen to stay at Chelsea FC despite interest from FC Barcelona, according to a report in the English media.</h3>
      <p>Website <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-in-talks-to-extend-willians-deal-despite-barcelona/dccm0n9a83l01nj0a8fl1pgp6">Goal</a> is reporting that the Brazil international is in talks with the west London side over a new deal at Stamford Bridge after his promising start to the season.</p>
      <p>The same article states that the 31-year-old is eager to stay at Chelsea FC despite the lure of moving to Spanish champions FC Barcelona.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Willian is currently in talks with the Stamford Bridge outfit over a new deal with little over six months left on his current contract.</p>
      <p><i>Goal</i> go on to report that Chelsea FC’s offer to Willian will be crucial as FC Barcelona continue to monitor the South American’s situation in the English capital.</p>
      <p>Willian will be a free agent at the end of the Premier League season unless Chelsea FC can reach an agreement with one of their longest-serving players in Frank Lampard’s squad.</p>
      <p><i>Goal</i> go on to highlight that Chelsea FC have traditionally been reluctant to offer players over the age of 30 a deal lasting longer than 12 months at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Willian has won two Premier League titles, the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Europa League during his spell at Chelsea FC.</p>
