      <h1>Amazon's Cloud Gaming Service Could Arrive Next Year With Twitch Integration</h1>

      <p>According to CNET, Amazon is <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/">planning to announce a cloud gaming service next year</a>, and it may offer integration with Twitch and its other services. From the report: <i>It's begun recruiting people from large game companies like Microsoft to help with the launch, as well as hiring for jobs in a "new initiative" within its Amazon Web Services team, which sources said is involved in Amazon's future gaming service. "We believe the evolution that began with arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and e-sports of today, will continue to a future where everyone is a gamer and every gamer can create, compete, collaborate and connect with others at massive scales," one job posting this month showed. And in at least one other job posting, the company said it wants to "drive innovative new use cases like machine vision and game streaming." <br/><br/>Amazon said in yet another job posting that it plans to integrate its new initiative with Twitch and the company's other services. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-game-streaming-service?shared=1aaeb3e97b12aa05">earlier reported</a> on Amazon's plans, citing a possible launch next year. Industry insiders believe Amazon's plans for a future video game service are a foregone conclusion, despite struggles in its game-making studios, which saw layoffs earlier this year. Instead, these people cite the company's sprawling $119 per year Prime subscription empire, which already includes music streaming, lauded video projects like The Man in the High Castle, free grocery delivery and more.</i></p>
