      <p>A state prosecutor has been shot dead in court after a shotgun entered as evidence went off when it was dropped on the floor.</p>
      <p>Addelaid Ferreira-Watt, 51, was blasted from point blank range in Ixopi Regional Court, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, on November 18.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one was rushed to hospital with an injury to her hip, but died of her injuries despite the the efforts of paramedics.</p>
      <p>It is thought the pellets severed an artery, causing the barrister to bleed to death.</p>
      <p>The incident is now being treated as culpable homicide by the South African Police Service, as the shotgun should not have been entered as evidence while still fully loaded.</p>

      <p>A friend of Ms Ferreira-Watt said: ‘There is absolutely no need for a weapon being submitted in evidence in a court of law to still be capable of being fired.</p>

      <p>‘The weapon and the ammunition that it had contained at the time of the alleged crime should have been submitted in separate evidence bags so someone is in big trouble.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Addelaid was an excellent lawyer and a devoted mother and a lover of art and animals and for her to be taken away so cruelly and in such a freakish way is just agonising.’</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson said the shotgun had allegedly been entered as evidence in a house robbery case when it ‘accidentally discharged in court’.</p>
      <p>They said the gun was ‘dropped or fell over’ during the proceedings, causing it to fire at Ms Ferreira-Watt.</p>

      <p>Sharing a picture of the pair, she wrote: ‘My dearest, my heroine, my best friend, my mentor, my pillar, my life… but above all, my mummy.’</p>
      <p>Antoinette Ferreira, Ms Ferreira-Watt ‘s sister-in-law, also thanked her friends for their prayers online.</p>
      <p>Writing a tribute, she continued: ‘A loving and caring mother, a loyal and dear friend, an incredibly smart, intelligent, dynamic resilient and beautiful woman. You filled my life with love and humour.</p>
      <p>‘We are so shocked you have been taken away in such a terrible way from your loved ones. A lot strength to you Lindsay – your mother loved you so much.’</p>
