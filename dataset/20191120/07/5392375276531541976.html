      <p>True Wireless Headset Market Growing Rapidly: Apple Leads<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>According to a new report from the research institute <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-true-wireless-hearables-market-reaches-33-million-units-q3-2019/">Counterpoint Research</a>, true wireless headset shipping volume in the last quarter has increased significantly. In the third quarter of 2019, the global real headset market reached 33 million units ($4.1 billion), a 22% increase from the previous quarter.</p>
      <p>Geographically speaking, the United States accounts for 31% of the global market. And for the first time, in a single quarter, overall sales reached more than 10 million units. China’s share has significantly expanded, with a 44% increase in the third quarter.</p>

      <p>Apple’s AirPods wireless headsets still lead in this category. But as competition intensifies, there is every reason to think Apple will lose some market share soon. Globally, in the last quarter, Apple accounted for 53% of the true wireless headset category. Only this number is currently down to 45%. It has fallen from more than half to less than half, but the volume is still quite large.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi occupies a 9% market share in the true wireless headset category, ranking second, mainly because of the significant increase in sales in the Chinese market. Their <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/09/07/redmi-airdots-true-wireless-bluetooth-headset-cumulative-sales-exceeded-3-million/">Redmi Airdots</a> is priced around $20. You know Samsung is one of Apple’s main competitors in the smartphone market. They also manufacture true wireless headset products. But it takes only 6% of the market share, ranking third. Amoi, a Chinese brand is also eye-catching, and its F9 headset sales are mainly from the Chinese domestic market. As a result, Amoi has surpassed QCY, ranking sixth in the world and becoming a new leader in low-priced products.</p>

      <p>In this market, Apple’s Beats brand headphones also stand out. Their recent product Powerbeats Pro has been warmly welcomed by consumers, ranking among the top five, in terms of shipments.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that since the survey was only in the third quarter of 2019, the data of the new AirPods Pro has not been reflected in the results. But according to Counterpoint Research, it will have a positive boost.</p>
      <p>In recent months, Amazon and Microsoft have also launched Amazon Echo Buds and Microsoft Surface Earbuds, respectively. So, coupled with several other Chinese competitors, the competition in the true wireless headset industry is becoming more and fiercer.</p>
