      <p><b>Volkswagen</b> is about to bridge the size gap between the most popular types of double cab ute in Australia and the full size pick-ups from the USA.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/">Volkswagen Australia</a> is poised to introduce a factory-approved conversion that significantly lengthens the wheelbase and tray of its Amarok ute.</p>
      <p>The stretch will be available in two sizes: <b>+310mm (XL)</b> and <b>+650mm (XXL).</b> The conversion is available for all variants of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/volkswagen/amarok/">Amarok</a>, regardless of trim and driveline, and retains the full five-year factory Volkswagen warranty.</p>
      <p>This will increase the Amarok's wheelbase from 3095mm to <b>3405mm</b> or <b>3745mm,</b> and its overall length from 5254mm to <b>5564mm</b> or <b>5904mm</b>.</p>
      <p>This compares to a 5817mm of overall length for a Ram 1500, and 6085mm for a Chevrolet Silverado 2500.</p>
      <p>The length of load space in the tub of the Amarok increases too, from 1555mm to either <b>1865mm</b> or <b>2205mm.</b></p>

      <p>The mastermind of the conversion is Netherlands-based Veth Automotive, but Australian conversions will be carried out by Adaptive Manufacturing in South Australia.</p>
      <p>The Amarok’s chassis gets chopped fore of the rear spring hangers, meaning the leaf springs and surrounding chassis remains unmodified.</p>
      <p>The rear prop shaft, brake, and electric lines are lengthened to match the chassis stretch, and the ESC is also retuned to suit the increase in length.</p>
      <p>There is no change to GVM and towing capacity with the conversion, although payload will be decreased slightly by the increase in kerb weight. There will be different stability control settings to suit different centre of gravity setups: low, medium or high.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This will help Amaroks with increased ride height, or equipped heavy canopies/bodies that raise the centre of gravity.</p>
      <p>The dual-cab tub is modified to suit the conversion, with an extension grafted into place to suit the new overall length. Volkswagen doesn’t offer single-cab or extra-cab variants.</p>
      <p>This conversion will be available to existing Amarok owners, but will also be available to purchase or order from the showroom floor.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen is looking to have the Amarok XL and Amarok XXL available for Australian buyers from mid-2020.</p>

      <p>Pricing for the conversion hasn’t been locked down yet, but a spokesperson from Volkswagen told us an Amarok XL with a tub would be less that <b>$15,000</b> more expensive that its shorter counterpart.</p>
      <p>The conversion will also be available as cab-chassis at a reduced cost, for those looking to fit trays, canopies and service bodies for work or play.</p>
