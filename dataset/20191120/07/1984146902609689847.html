      <h2>As part of our end-of-decade series we look at the most memorable moments of the last 10 years for Newcastle United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Knight</a></address>
      <p>We are little more than a month away from the end of a turbulent decade for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a>.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have twice secured instant returns to the Premier League as title-winners, and enjoyed a Europa League campaign after briefly flirting with a top-four finish.</p>
      <p>But fans have also endured a second relegation to the Championship, a number of high-profile departures and protests in the stands at the continued ownership of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/mike-ashley">Mike Ashley</a>.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the most memorable moments from the decade for Newcastle United - both good and bad.</p>
      <h3>Promotion under Hughton</h3>

      <p>The decade began in promising fashion, as United managed to secure an immediate return to the top flight.</p>
      <p>It looked like it could be another long campaign when the recently-relegated side were infamously thrashed 6-1 at Leyton Orient in pre-season.</p>
      <p>There was an exodus of players following relegation, and several interested buyers were unable to strike a deal with Mike Ashley for a takeover.</p>
      <p>The Magpies began the season without a manager, but the likes of Joey Barton, Fabricio Coloccini, Jose Enrique, Jonas Gutierrez, and Kevin Nolan came to the fore at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>Caretaker boss Chris Hughton steadied the ship and was rewarded with the full-time position, with the Magpies going on to land the title after racking up 102 points.</p>

      <h3>Newcastle 5-1 Sunderland</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>In their first season back in the Premier League, United made up for lost time and thrashed their rivals with a dominant display that likely stands as the highlight of Hughton's reign.</p>
      <p>The Black Cats failed to handle the physical presence of Shola Ameobi and Andy Carroll up front, while Nolan helped himself to a hat-trick in the emphatic victory.</p>
      <p>A quick-fire double from the former Bolton midfielder and an Ameobi gave the relentless hosts a three-goal cushion at the break, and the pair both struck again to secure bragging rights on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have unfortunately played second fiddle in the Tyne-Wear derby this decade, and it remains the last time United have beaten their arch rivals at St James' Park.</p>
      <h3>Hughton sacked</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article7935281.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Chris-Hughton-1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Newcastle United manager Chris Hughton in April 2010</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Less than two months after the Tyne-Wear derby demolition, Hughton was dismissed with the Magpies sat 11th in the table in their first season back in the top flight.</p>
      <p>A club statement read: "Regrettably the board now feels that an individual with more managerial experience is needed to take the club forward."</p>
      <p>The decision drew widespread condemnation from fans and pundits alike, with many questioning the sense of sacking a popular manager who had stabilised the club following the shock relegation in 2009.</p>
      <p>Alan Pardew was quickly appointed as Hughton's replacement, and a section of supporters protested the decision to dismiss the 51-year-old at the next home fixture against Liverpool.</p>
      <h3>Carroll sold</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article9112589.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS53950527.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Andy Carroll in action for Newcastle</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Geordie frontman was rewarded for his fine form in the title-winning season with the treasured No 9 shirt, and made an electric start on his return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old bagged 11 goals in 19 Premier League appearances, and had forced his way into the England squad.</p>
      <p>But despite talk of a new contract on Tyneside, Carroll ended up departing Tyneside in January 2011 in what arguably remains the most dramatic deadline-day move to date.</p>
      <p>Flush with the cash from the £50m sale of Fernando Torres, Liverpool were determined to land United's No 9 and were undeterred by having several bids rejected.</p>
      <p>In the end, the Magpies relented to the sale of the homegrown hero in a £35m transfer - the eighth most expensive deal in football history at the time - in a decision which sent shockwaves through the fanbase.</p>
      <p>Pardew was left with no time to sign a replacement, and 34-year-old free agent Shefki Kuqi was drafted in days later as Carroll's replacement until the end of the season.</p>
      <h3>NUFC 4-4 Arsenal</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Cheick Tiote celebrates his memorable equaliser against Arsenal at St James' Park<cite>(Image: PA)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Days after the sale of Carroll, Pardew's side managed to achieve something no other Premier League side has ever done after securing a point from a four-goal deficit.</p>
      <p>The title-chasing Gunners raced into a seemingly unassailable lead at St James' Park through goals from Theo Walcott, Johan Djourou, and a Robin Van Persie brace after just 26 minutes.</p>
      <p>The dismissal of Abou Diaby minutes after the restart galvanised the Magpies, and led to the hosts scoring four goals in 19 minutes to complete an incredible comeback.</p>
      <p>Joey Barton scored the first from the penalty-spot after Laurent Koscielny fouled Leon Best, and the striker added a second minutes later.</p>
      <p>The Magpies were then given another penalty when Koscielny was judged to have fouled Mike Williamson, and Barton once again beat Wojciech Szczesny.</p>
      <p>Fuelled by their belief in the impossible, United managed to claw themselves level with minutes remaining courtesy of a thunderous volley from the late Cheick Tiote in one of the most remarkable finishes ever witnessed at St James' Park.</p>
      <h3>Cisse's wonder goal at Chelsea</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article1355022.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/papiss-cisse-celebrates-scoring-against-chelsea-at-stamford-bridge-80008719.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Papiss Cisse celebrates scoring against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Pardew's first full season in charge at St James' Park got off to a flyer, as the Magpies went unbeaten in their opening 11 Premier League fixtures.</p>
      <p>There was a dip towards the end of 2011, but United got back on track and thrashed Manchester United on Tyneside before the arrival of Papiss Cisse from Freiburg in January rejuvenated an unlikely top-four tilt.</p>
      <p>Pardew's side went toe-to-toe with Chelsea and Tottenham in their bid to clinch Champions League football, and won six on the bounce in March and April before a shock defeat at Wigan looked to derail their charge.</p>
      <p>Up stepped Cisse on a memorable night in the capital as the Magpies defeated the soon-to-be crowned Champions League winners on their own patch.</p>
      <p>The Senegalese striker's first was an impressive finish overshadowed by what was to come, lashing home a volley from the edge of the area to give the visitors the lead.</p>
      <p>The second however was so stupendous, it has to be regarded as one of the best strikes in Premier League history. Winding down the clock, Ameobi chested the ball down for Cisse by the left touchline, and the number nine went for goal for reasons only he will understand.</p>
      <p>Even more inexplicable was the trajectory of the strike, arcing perfectly over the despairing dive of Petr Cech to send the travelling supporters wild.</p>
      <p>The Magpies went on to finish fifth, and there were plenty of highlights to choose from along the way. This one is hard to top though. </p>
      <h3>Europa League run</h3>

        <figcaption>Papiss Cisse and Steven Taylor celebrate Newcastle United's stoppage-time winner against Anzhi</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Magpies' domestic form struggled the following season, with Pardew's side narrowly avoiding a return to the Championship.</p>
      <p>But United fans were treated to a real rarity in the Mike Ashley era on Tyneside - a cup run.</p>
      <p>Pardew's side managed to shrug off their struggles in the Premier League to storm to the quarter finals of the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Young guns were given the opportunity to shine as United eased through to the knockout stages before dispatching Metalist Kharkiv and Anzhi Makhachkala.</p>
      <p>Cisse netted a dramatic late winner at St James' Park to see off the Russian side boasting Samuel Eto'o to setup a quarter-final tie with Benfica.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese side's quality shone through in the first leg in Lisbon in a 3-1 victory, and they remained in control for much of the return clash on Tyneside.</p>
      <p>But when Cisse pulled one back with less than 20 minutes remaining, Pardew's rope-a-dope tactics came in to play as the hosts pushed for the winner that would clinch another famous victory.</p>
      <p>Eduardo Salvio's injury-time strike ensured Benfica would advance, but the Magpies bowed out with pride.</p>
      <h3>Pardew's headbutt</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article6761598.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Alan-Pardew.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew clashes with David Meyler of Hull City</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>United claimed an emphatic 4-1 victory at Hull City on March 1, 2014. But that wasn't the story of the day.</p>
      <p>The match at the KC Stadium will forever be remembered for Pardew's extraordinary headbutt on David Meyler following a touchline row.</p>
      <p>The Hull midfielder collided with the Magpies' boss in an attempt to collect the ball for a quick throw-in, and tensions quickly boiled over despite the comfortable 3-1 scoreline at the time.</p>
      <p>Pardew pushed his face into Meyler's face in an ugly melee, and was sent to the stands as a result of his unfathomable actions.</p>
      <p>It was arguably the beginning of the end for Pardew at St James' Park. The Magpies sat eighth in the table, but the manager was fined £100,000 and his relationship with supporters was already strained.</p>
      <p>Pardew would remain in charge until late December, when he accepted an offer for the post at Crystal Palace.</p>
      <h3>THAT Jonas goal</h3>

        <figcaption>Jonas Gutierrez of Newcastle United celebrates scoring against West Ham United</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>John Carver was tasked with replacing Pardew until the end of the season, but the Magpies' fortunes took a sharp downturn.</p>
      <p>United plummeted down the table and almost snatched relegation from the jaws of mid-table mediocrity.</p>
      <p>Along the way as a humbling 3-0 defeat at Leicester City - the Magpies' eighth consecutive league loss - where United finished with nine men and Carver publicly accused Mike Williamson of deliberately getting sent off.</p>
      <p>It came down to a final-day shootout with Hull City to secure Premier League survival. West Ham were the visitors at St James' Park, and the Magpies knew victory would be enough to secure their top-flight status.</p>
      <p>Moussa Sissoko helped ease tensions with a header just after half-time, but it was Jonas Gutierrez - fresh from his battle with testicular cancer and set to be released - who stepped up with just five minutes left to deliver once of the most iconic moments in recent history at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>The Argentine's shot bobbled past Adrian into the bottom corner in front of the Gallowgate Stand, and the popular winger cupped his ears to owner Mike Ashley in celebration as the stadium was rocked by a spine-tingling roar.</p>
      <h3>Newcastle 5-1 Tottenham</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Newcastle fans show their appreciation of manager Rafa Benitez<cite>(Image: Stu Forster/Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>United's narrow escape failed to deliver a fresh impetus, as the Magpies ultimately succumbed to relegation the following season.</p>
      <p>Steve McClaren was appointed as head coach, and was afforded a lavish spending spree on signings such as Aleksandar Mitrovic, Florian Thauvin, and Georginio Wijnaldum.</p>
      <p>United made a dismal start to the campaign, and the January outlay on Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend could not stop the rot under the former Derby boss.</p>
      <p>The pressure on McClaren was palpable, and his disastrous reign reached a nadir in the home defeat to Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Despite the club's predicament, Rafa Benitez was somehow convinced to take up a relegation battle just months after leaving Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>The managerial change came too late to save the Magpies, and it was expected the Spaniard would take advantage of a break clause to leave the North East.</p>
      <p>But a remarkable 5-1 thumping over Champions League-chasing Tottenham with 10 men combined with a devoted crowd imploring him to stay convinced Benitez to lead the Magpies' bid to return to the top flight.</p>
      <h3>Championship final day</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Newcastle United manager Rafa Benitez celebrates with the Sky Bet Championship trophy</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Benitez replicated the achievement of his predecessor Hughton in guiding United back to the Premier League at the first time of asking, picking up the Championship title along the way.</p>
      <p>The Magpies bounced back from two opening defeats to establish themselves in the automatic promotion spots along with Brighton - ironically managed by the former United boss.</p>
      <p>In the final stages of the campaign, both sides had already clinched promotion and attention turned to the title.</p>
      <p>The Seagulls were in the driving seat but surprisingly lost two on the bounce, and had to win at Aston Villa on the final day to lift the title.</p>
      <p>United were holding up their end of the bargain at home to Barnsley, and a Glenn Murray penalty looked to have Hughton's side on course for the trophy.</p>
      <p>But in the 89th minute, a deflected strike from Jack Grealish earned Villa a draw, and news of the equaliser was met with a resounding roar on Tyneside.</p>
      <h3>Newcastle 2-1 Man City</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Newcastle United's Matt Ritchie scores his side's second goal of the game from the penalty spot during the Premier League match at St James' Park, Newcastle.<cite>(Image: PA)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Undoubtedly the highlight of the Benitez era.</p>
      <p>The defending champions arrived at St James' Park needing a victory to close the gap on league leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Victory seemed a formality for Pep Guardiola's side against the Magpies, who had not beaten the Citizens in the league since September 2005.</p>
      <p>It looked like it might be a procession for the visitors when Sergio Aguero fired them into the lead after just 24 seconds.</p>
      <p>But despite the champions' domination in possession, the Magpies picked themselves up and showed remarkable resilience.</p>
      <p>Benitez's side stayed in the contest, and dragged themselves level just after the hour-mark when Salomon Rondon reacted quickest to Isaac Hayden's header.</p>
      <p>United were then handed a golden chance to seize all three points when Sean Longstaff caught Fernandinho in possession and was brought down in the area.</p>
      <p>Following a nervy wait, Matt Ritchie stepped up to lash the Magpies' in front and the hosts held on for an incredible victory.</p>
      <p>To put the achievement into context, City went on to win every Premier League match afterwards and pip Liverpool to the crown with 98 points.</p>
      <h3>Benitez leaving</h3>

        <figcaption>Rafa Benitez applauds the Newcastle fans at Fulham<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3> </h3>
      <p>It was the outcome every Newcastle United fan dreaded throughout Benitez's tenure.</p>
      <p>The popular Spaniard was at constant loggerheads with Mike Ashley during his stay at St James' Park, frustrated by what he perceived as a lack of ambition.</p>
      <p>The former Real Madrid boss led the Magpies back into the top flight at the first time of asking, before achieving respectable 10th and 13th place finishes.</p>
      <p>However, Benitez's final season was dogged by constant speculation over whether he would be extending his stay. Unfortunately neither party could reach a satisfactory agreement, and the club announced on June 24 that the Spaniard would be leaving at the end of his contract.</p>
      <p>The outcry from fans was deafening and the continued dwindling attendances is evidence that for some fans, Benitez's departure was the final straw under the current regime.</p>
      <p>Head coach Steve Bruce has faced heightened scrutiny in his turbulent stint to date, but has managed to guide the Magpies to their best start in the Premier League since Alan Pardew.</p>
      <p>But Benitez's exit widened the already sizeable chasm between disgruntled supporters and Mike Ashley, and it remains to be seen just how damaging it will prove heading into the next decade.</p>
