      <h1>Noah Hawley to Write And Direct Next 'Star Trek' Film for Paramount</h1>
      <h2>Film will be fourth in the series that began with 2009’s “Star Trek” reboot</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:28:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/umberto-gonzalez/" target="_blank">Umberto Gonzalez</a></address>
      <p>“Legion” creator Noah Hawley is in talks to write and direct the next “star trek” film for Paramount, an individual with knowledge of the project tells TheWrap.</p>
      <p>The film will be fourth in the series that began with 2009’s “Star Trek” reboot. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Simon Pegg and Karl Urban are expected to return. Hawley will also produce via his 26 Keys production banner along with JJ Abrams and his Bad Robot banner.</p>
      <p>There are currently three “Star Trek 4” scripts, TheWrap previously reported, speaking to a person familiar with the project — <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/zachary-quinto-3-star-trek-4-scripts-including-quentin-tarantinos/">a fact let slip by Spock actor Zachary Quinto</a> in a 2018 interview with E.T. Canada.</p>

      <p>Incidentally, it’s not the first time a “Star Trek” sequel has arisen out of multiple scripts. 1982’s “Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan” was an amalgam of multiple screenplays. When Nicholas Meyer came aboard to direct, he picked through what he liked out of all of them — including original TV series creator Gene Roddenberry’s — and <a href="http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/star-trek/243679/the-difficult-journey-of-star-trek-ii-the-wrath-of-khan">stitched them together</a>.</p>
      <p>The next “Trek” film was tentatively scheduled for a 2019 release, but Paramount hasn’t announced a production start date yet.</p>
      <p>Hawley made his feature film directorial debut on “Lucy in the Sky,” which stars Natalie Portman, Jon Hamm, Dan Stevens, Zazie Beetz, Pearl Amanda Dickson, Tig Notaro and Ellen Burstyn. The film premiered at the Toronto Film Festival and was released in the fall by Fox Searchlight.</p>
      <p>Hawley is repped by CAA.</p>

          <figcaption>In its half-century history, "Star Trek" has challenged us to boldly go where no one has gone before. The best characters have often encouraged vigorous debate among Trekkies, as they are compared by their rank and species and evaluated for differences in their flaws and virtues. The worst -- we're looking at you "Voyager" and "Enterprise" -- leave fans wondering if there's a point to their existence.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption>A quick note, to keep the list manageable, we're restricting the list to the main cast of the five "Trek" shows before "Discovery." That means you won't be seeing movie villains like Khan or recurring characters like Q. But let it be said that if we did include him, Q would top the list by several light years.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

A super-genius kid who would on more than one occasion save the Enterprise while others with infinitely more experience struggled. Even the man who played him, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/wil_wheaton/">Wil Wheaton</a>, hated him.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Hoshi Sato (Enterprise)</b> <br/>... a poor man's Uhura whose sole purpose was to serve as a translator for the crew since the technology for the Universal Translator hadn't been invented yet. Like many of the characters at the bottom of this list, Rick Berman and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/brannon_braga/">Brannon Braga</a> were unable to flesh Sato out beyond her basic premise.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>34. Chakotay (Voyager)</b><br/>Another character that the writers ran out of material for. At best, Captain Janeway's right hand man was a dull character. At worst, the attempts to honor <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/gene_roddenberry/">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s dedication to diversity by delving into Chakotay's Native American background came off as too stereotypical.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Unlike Sato and Mayweather, Reed had a bit of a character arc as he spent his time on the Enterprise coming out of his shell, but this didn't result in Reed becoming much more than a generally affable but nondescript character.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Deanna Troi (TNG)</b><br/>Take a shot every time this Betazoid started a sentence with the words "I sense …" Troi spent several seasons in low-neckline outfits, serving as a counselor on a ship that rarely had any real conflict. Eventually, she was given a uniform like the others and allowed to play a role in missions, but only at a very late point in the series.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

As Starfleet's first man in charge, he was bound to make mistakes, and viewers enjoying seeing how he got out of them. Unfortunately, the struggle got stale quick, as he became the "prototype" captain instead of developing into a leader in his own right.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

T'Pol (Enterprise)</b> <br/>Though Jolene Blalock's acting could sometimes be as ridiculous as her fanservice outfits, the first Vulcan Starfleet officer's slow embrace of her illogical humans was interesting to watch, as was her struggle to cope with a disease that dissolved control over her emotions. <cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Over the course of six seasons, Dax showed Worf's intensity, Kirk's swagger, and Spock's curiosity. Part of this is due to the fact that she's bonded with a symbiont that has the memories of countless past lives. It's also due to inconsistent writing, particularly after she hooked up with Worf in Season 4.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Quark (DS9)</b><br/>The Ferengi started as the Alpha Quadrant's amoral mafia, but DS9 began to show their capacity for courage and compassion, though they would be loath to admit it. In spite of his insistence that he's nothing but a cowardly smuggler -- and he <i>can </i>be that -- Quark proves to be a valuable ally to Sisko when the chips are down.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

She was a rather polarizing figure, with some people appreciating her status as a more involved woman on the bridge, while others thought she was rather obnoxious. She was killed off near the end of season 1, but was brought back in the episode "Yesterday's Enterprise," which was praised for showing Tasha's true potential as a character while giving her a better send-off.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Tim Russ proved to be a worthy successor to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/leonard_nimoy/">Leonard Nimoy</a>, portraying Tuvok as a loyal friend to Janeway and a Vulcan with a dark side beneath all the discipline and repressed emotions.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Pavel Chekov (Star Trek)</b><br/>Several members of the original Enterprise crew were not fleshed out on paper, but became beloved thanks to brilliant acting and natural chemistry between the cast.

Hikaru Sulu (Trek)</b> <br/>Like Chekhov's Walt Koenig and Uhura's Nichelle Nichols, the two-dimensional Sulu became legendary thanks to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/george_takei/">George Takei</a>. For a long time, Sulu was known for being a cultured gentleman and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szS3SJDaBGc">bare-chested fencer</a>, but he got his big moment in the movie "Star Trek VI" as captain of the Excelsior.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Seven of Nine (Voyager) </b><br/>Like Uhura, Troi, and T'Pol, Seven of Nine was the fanservice character of her series, but her introduction to "Voyager" is an episode for the ages. As a former Borg unit brought to Janeway's side, Seven continued the tradition of rounding out alien races that were once bitter Federation enemies by showing just why someone would want to be assimilated.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

In addition to her character swinging from mother figure to ruthless general depending on the writer, Janeway threw away the Federation rulebook in ways that even Kirk would be shocked by as she tried to guide the Voyager back home. Say what you will, but Janeway is an interesting figure in the "Trek" canon, which is why she's ranked so high. <cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

Sisko proved to be a truly fearsome captain, but gained that reputation through brutal actions that compromised his ideals. His internal conflict was a driving component behind DS9's deconstruction of <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/gene_roddenberry/">Gene Roddenberry</a>'s utopia through war and racial conflict.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>1. Jean-Luc Picard ("TNG")</b> <br/>Yep, we're planting our flag firmly in the Frenchman's territory when it comes to the "Best Captain" debate. If Spock began the "Trek" philosophizing, Picard perfected it. He is a diplomat and a scholar, and remains so despite suffering torture and countless near-death situations. He is the embodiment of the intellect-over-brutality ideal that "Star Trek" built its legacy on.<cite>Paramount</cite></figcaption>
