      <h1>The brilliant de-icing trick that saves tons of time - and warms your hands</h1>
      <h2>You'll never have to worry about frosty mornings any longer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:51:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:51</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Standley, Christopher Harper</a></address>
      <p>As temperatures begin to drop significantly, de-icing your car will eventually become a daily chore.</p>
      <p>So any helping hand you can find to make the process that much easier is a life-saver.</p>
      <p>But a viral way of de-icing your car has emerged which involved filling a sandwich bag with warm water.</p>
      <p>This technique was popularised by a viral video on Facebook, reports <a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/nifty-trick-de-icing-car-3506624">Hull Live</a> .</p>
      <p>According to the video, rather than scraping ice off windscreens on a frosty morning, drivers simply need to fill a sandwich bag with warm water from the tap and drag it along the glass.</p>
      <p>It clears the ice instantly - and keeps your hands warm.</p>
      <p>If you're not convinced, the AA has revealed how to get a head start on cold mornings with their tips for de-icing windscreens.</p>
      <p>They said drivers need to make sure their wipers are off before doing any de-icing as the wiper motor could be damaged and the rubber could tear off after freezing to the car overnight.</p>
      <p>Air con should be used as well, as it sucks moisture out of the car to prevent it misting up and blocking the view on the inside of the glass as well as the outside.</p>
      <p>The AA also said drivers should always stay with their vehicles while it is de-icing as thieves can take advantage of unwitting motorists who leave their engines running while clearing the windscreen.</p>
      <p>And they have warned against using boiling water to de-ice windscreens, as the quick expansion and contraction of the glass can cause it to crack.</p>
      <p>Finally, and most importantly, they warned drivers to ensure the windscreen is fully clear before driving off, as leaving with obstructed vision can be dangerous and even land motorists with a fine and points on their licence.</p>
