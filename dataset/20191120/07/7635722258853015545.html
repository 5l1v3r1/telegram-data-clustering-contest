        <b>Twitter has criticised the UK Conservative Party for rebranding one of their accounts as a fake factchecking service during last night's general election leaders' debate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/johnson-corbyn-clash-first-uk-general-election-debate-926934">faced off in the ITV debate</a></b>, clashing over issues such as Brexit and the NHS.</p>
      <p>During the debate, the Conservative press office account - CCHQ Press - renamed and rebranded their verified account as 'FactCheckUK', posting pro-Johnson and anti-Corbyn tweets throughout the evening.</p>

      <p>As of Wednesday morning the account had reverted back to the CCHQ name and branding.</p>
      <p>The independent UK factchecking group Full Fact was among those who criticised the Tories for the move - describing itÂ as "inappropriate and misleading".</p>

      <p><b><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50482637">In a statement quoted by BBC</a></b>, meanwhile, Twitter said any similar efforts in the future would be met with "decisive corrective action".</p>
      <p>A company spokesperson said: "Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election.</p>
      <blockquote>"We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts.</blockquote>
      <p>"Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action."</p>
      <p>The Conservative chairman James Cleverly was questioned about by <i>BBC Newsnight's</i> Emily Maitlis about the issue, with the presenter accusing the party of a 'dystopian' effort to 'dress up party lines as a fact-check service'.</p>
      <p>Mr Cleverly defended the move, arguing: "The Twitter handle of the CCHQ press office remained CCHQ Press - so it's clear the nature of the site.</p>
      <p>"The reason we did is because we were calling out the inaccuracies, the lies that were coming out during the debate."</p>
