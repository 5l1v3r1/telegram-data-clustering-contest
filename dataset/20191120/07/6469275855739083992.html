      <p>It is believed that one of the vehicles also collided with a telegraph pole.</p>
      <p>North West Ambulance Service said two casualties have been taken to hospital in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>An NWAS spokesman said: "We were called at 4.01am to a road traffic accident in Moss Lane, Burscough.</p>
      <p>"We sent two ambulances, a rapid response unit, an advanced paramedic and a Hazardous Area Response Team to the scene.</p>
      <p>"Two people were taken to hospital."</p>
      <p>NWAS said it was unable to provide details on the casualties' current condition.</p>
      <p>The Hazardous Area Response Team (HART) is made up of specially trained paramedics who attend incidents that are declared a major incident.</p>
      <p>Moss Lane remains closed in both directions, between Sluice Lane in Rufford and Red Cat Lane in Burscough, whilst police continue to investigate.</p>
      <p>The A59 junction with New Road, near the Hesketh Arms pub, has also been closed.</p>
      <p>Fire crews were also called to the scene to free trapped casualties from the vehicles.</p>
      <p>An LFRS spokesman said: "We attended an road traffic accident at 4.05am in Moss lane, Burscough.</p>
      <p>"We sent two fire engines from Ormskirk.</p>
      <p>"We helped free a number of casualties who had been trapped inside the vehicles.</p>
      <p>"We were on the scene for around two hours and were stood down at around 6.20am."</p>
      <p>Police are urging people to avoid the area, with the A59 expected to remain closed for some time.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: "We are asking motorists to continue to avoid the A59 between Burscough and Rufford as the road is still closed due to a serious collision.</p>
      <p>"We were called at around 4.10am this morning to a report that a number of vehicles had collided.</p>
      <p>"A number of people have been injured as a result and the road remains closed between Red Cat Lane in Burscough and New Road in Rufford whilst we investigate and repairs are carried out to a telegraph pole.</p>
      <p>"Red Cat Lane in Burscough and the surrounding roads are congested and traffic in Rufford is being diverted towards Mawdesley which is also making the B5246 very busy.</p>
      <p>"We'd urge people to avoid the area if possible for the remainder of the morning.</p>
      <p>"We will let everyone know as soon as the road has re-opened."</p>
