        <b>These are the tense scenes which see David Platt (Jack P Shepherd) and Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton) once again come face to face as Josh stands trial for rape in Coronation Street. When David first reported the crime, the police had insufficient evidence to prosecute but now there is a chance that Josh could pay for his crime.</b>
      </p>
      <p>David last came into contact with Josh when he was in prison. During a riot, Josh was stabbed and David took the blame as Josh framed him for the attempted murder. However, after some pressure from Paul Foreman (Peter Ash), Josh told the truth.</p>
      <p>Now, Coronation Street cast have been filming scenes at court which will see David take the stand against Josh, who was in prison after committing a further sexual assault. Will David be believed as he relives the horrendous ordeal and hopefully seizes closure?</p>

      <p>Jack and Ryan were spotted taking a break from filming and having some lunch outside of the court set on location. It has already been confirmed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/julia-goulding/">Julia Goulding</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/exit-coronation-street-pregnant-julia-goulding-shona-ramsey-leaving-11164043/"> has filmed her final scenes as David’s wife Shona</a> so it seems likely that she won’t be present to support him in court.</p>

      <p>These could well be the final scenes for Josh as his storyline reaches a close. He was first introduced as a mate for David but he soon took advantage by drugging him and sexually assaulting him.</p>

      <p>David felt too ashamed to open up but it was the suicide of Aidan Connor which prompted David to speak out as he feared he could meet a similar fate. Charges against Josh were dropped but David drove him out of Weatherfield, only coming face to face with him again when he was jailed for Nick’s (Ben Price) theft of Audrey’s (Sue Nicholls) money.</p>
