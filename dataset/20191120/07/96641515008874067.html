      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/laautoshow2019/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">LA Auto Show</a> is in full swing, so we've got electrified vehicles from Audi, Karma and Lincoln to discuss. A fourth <i>Star Trek</i> movie has found its writer/director, Sony is investing in AI for gastronomy and, last but not least, we have the list of Game Awards nominees. Enjoy your Wednesday.</p>

      <p>Audi's third EV is this E-Tron Sportback. While the inside is similar to its other electric SUV, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/audi-e-tron-unveil/">sleeker design is meant to make the vehicle more stylish and, as a bonus, makes it more aerodynamic</a>. That, along with tweaks to the battery pack, gives it more range, as it's targeting an EPA-estimated 220 miles per charge compared to the regular E-Tron's 204.</p>
      <p>The Sportback is also Audi's first vehicle <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/audi-e-tron-headlight-tech/">to feature digital matrix LED headlights</a>. If you live outside the US and get one of these, then when you're on the highway, it will use micro-mirror to create a "carpet of light" illuminating the ground ahead in your lane. The Audi E-Tron Sportback will be available for purchase in Europe in spring 2020 and the US after that.</p>

      <p>While Hawley is so far best known for his work on FX TV series <i>Fargo </i>and <i>Legion</i>, he made his feature-film debut earlier this year on<i> Lucy in the Sky.</i> Now he's reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/star-trek-noah-hawley-paramount/">slated to write and direct a fourth <i>Star Trek</i> movie</a> in the current run, with actors Chris Pine, Zoe Saldana, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban all returning.</p>

      <p>From mobile game smash hit to entire multimedia franchise, <i>Angry Birds</i> has decided to celebrate its 10th birthday <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/angry-birds-venting-machine-nyc/">with a venting machine you can, well, lash out at</a>. Coated in red foam to protect your angry fists, the Venting Machine will only be available for one day -- Thursday November 21st, between 12 PM and 8PM -- but it'll be hard to miss with WWE star The Big Show putting it through its paces. For raging at the machine, you'll get a little reward, too.</p>

      <p>Sony's new AI department is going beyond Aibo. A new arm, spread across Japan, Europe and the US, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/sony-ai/">will first focus on gaming, imaging and gastronomy</a>. The latter addition will follow up on a concept video shown last year focused on 'robot gastronomy', so hopefully it will result in some interesting applications of AI and food -- so we can all shut up about our Instant Pots.</p>

      <p>A product page, source-code sleuths and <i>TechCrunch </i>tipsters suggest that Niantic is partnering on <i>Catan: World Explorers</i>, an AR title based on the classic colony-building game<i> Settlers of Catan</i>. While the game's mechanics aren't completely clear, it looks like it really is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/catan-world-explorers-ar-game/">an attempt to squeeze Niantic's basic formula into <i>Catan's</i> world of hexagonal grids</a>, road building and resource trading.</p>
