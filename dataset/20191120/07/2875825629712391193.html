      <p>Popular fast food chain German Doner Kebab (GDK) have announced plans to open 40 outlets across Ireland.</p>
      <p>The first GDK restaurant is expected to open in the summer of 2020 and is expected to provide 25 new jobs initially.</p>
      <p>Over the past four years, GDK has opened a number of outlets across the UK with further plans for future expansion.</p>
      <p>According to the Independent.ie the first GDK will open in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> in June 2020, followed by a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/belfast">Belfast</a> opening and a roll-out to other cities and large towns.</p>
      <p>Claiming roots to an 1980's Berlin diner, GDK is now headquartered in Glasgow since 2015 and has branches across the UK, Sweden, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>Managing director Daniel Bunce told Independent.ie: "We believe expansion into Ireland is the perfect next step for the brand."</p>
      <p>The fast-food outlet offers competitive prices with kebabs ranging from €5.85 - €7.</p>
