      <p>A 19-year-old man was on Wednesday morning shot dead by a Kenya Navy soldier in Mtongwe, Mombasa.</p>
      <p>The man, identified as Leonard Komora, ran a Boda Boda business in the area.</p>
      <p>According to reports Komora had gone to pick a customer at the Mtongwe army quarters when he met his death at around 6.45 AM.</p>
      <p>Likoni Sub-County Police Commander Jane Munyoki said the man was shot for accessing a restricted area.</p>
      <p>“The report we have is that the rider was shot at for trespass. We have started further investigations,” said Munyoki.</p>
      <p>Local Boda Boda operators dismissed the claims saying it’s normal for them to pick and drop customers, mostly Navy officers, in the area.</p>

      <p>Ali Khamisi, who knew the deceased, however, said the soldiers sometimes harass them.</p>
      <p>“The only customers that we usually pick are the soldiers themselves, but we usually suffer in the hands of these people,” Khamisi told <i>Nation</i>.</p>
      <p>Komora’s mother, Martha Njeri Munene, called on speedy investigation into the incident saying her son was not a criminal and didn’t deserve to die.</p>
      <p>“This is unfair. They have killed my son for no good reason. He was my only son. He was the one providing for me,” she said.</p>
