        <b>HE jetted off abroad to miss the last European Championships.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But John McGinn is confident he <b>WON’T</b> be holidaying next summer.</p>

      <p>The Aston Villa midfielder kept his superb run of goals for Scotland going by slamming home two in the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4973367/scotland-2-kazakhstan-1-john-mcginn-euro/">3-1 victory over Kazakhstan</a>.</p>
      <p>McGinn, who has now scored seven in the last six games, admits he couldn’t watch the tournament in France three years ago because we were the only Home Nation not invited to the party.</p>
      <p>There’s every chance Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will join Wales and England at next summer’s competition, so McGinn knows failure in the play-offs next March is <b>NOT</b> an option.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was tough in 2016 and to be honest I didn’t watch much of the competition.</p>

      <p>“I was on the periphery of the squad at the time and know how close we got to qualifying only to fall short. So with everyone else there, it was so hard to watch.</p>
      <p>“I went on holiday, I was out of the country and spent my time chilling out instead of watching it. I managed to avoid it as much as I could.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t booked a holiday for next summer because I believe we’ll get there.</p>
      <p>“For a long time it has been Scotland sitting on the sidelines when other teams are playing in major championships.</p>
      <p>“There won’t be another country in the Home Nations who are craving getting to this Euros more than us.</p>
      <p>“We just want to give the fans, the loyal supporters who turn out to watch us, something to shout about. Getting to a major tournament for them is the aim of everyone.</p>
      <p>“It is up to us to change things, we know we have good players but it’s only us who can change it.</p>
      <p>“You have to be able to handle the pressure of playing for Scotland and take that burden on our shoulders.</p>

      <p>“For a long time you were watching the highlights and seeing the lads play well for their clubs every week, but we were not contributing enough in a Scotland jersey.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why that was, but you are starting to see a difference now.</p>
      <p>“We were a squad and a nation battered for confidence at the start of the campaign but slowly and surely we have built it up.</p>
      <p>“Getting a strong end to the campaign was massive, we have had three wins in a row now and we’re looking forward to the play-offs.</p>
      <p>"In the second half tonight you saw a Scotland team again and hopefully in March we can keep it going.</p>
      <p>“We just go back to our clubs now, focus on playing as well as we can in the league and then be fit and ready by the time the play-offs come.”</p>
      <p>McGinn went 15 games without scoring for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> but a goal against Russia in September opened the floodgates.</p>
      <p>A hat-trick against San Marino followed, while a strike in Cyprus and the double against Kazakhstan give him an impressive tally.</p>

      <p>And on chances presented to him, the ex-<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibs</a> man admits he could have had another match ball to keep.</p>
      <p>He said: "I feel like I’m going to score in every game now and I think I could have had a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>“It’s odd. I went 15 caps without a goal. I think that is right. And it was annoying me. Then I got the goal against Russia and it just seems to have come from there.</p>
      <p>“I have never had a run of scoring like this before, Naisy has helped as he links the play and I can feed off the scraps.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully I can carry it on, if it is helping the team and the campaign I am delighted.</p>
      <p>“If I can carry it on into the play-offs, I think it helps the way the team is playing.”</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke was hit by a spate of call-offs once automatic qualification from the group was beyond Scotland.</p>
      <p>The likes of Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney, Kenny McLean and Ryan Fraser will be desperate to be involved next year.</p>
      <p>And McGinn added: “We have a lot of players to come back, we are fortunate to have the likes of Andy Robertson, Kieran Tierney, Ryan Fraser and Kenny McLean.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully they will all be fit for March and we will have a really strong squad.</p>
      <p>“The players who have come in have made it difficult for the gaffer, it will be up to him what he does when he watches how everyone is playing.”</p>
