      <p>The night after Sunday’s loss in the CFL West Division final wasn’t restful for Saskatchewan Roughriders head coach Craig Dickenson.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-head-coach-craig-dickenson-scores-points-with-his-honesty">“I didn’t sleep great, but I’ll sleep better (Monday) and moving forward, we’re going to be all right,” Dickenson said while meeting with the media after Sunday’s 20-13 loss to the visiting Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Dickenson addressed a number of issues while wrapping up an eventful season for the 13-5 Roughriders, who finished first in the West Division for the first time since 2009.</p>

      <p>Here is an edited transcript of Dickenson’s session with the local media.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: How long will it take for you to get over what happened Sunday and appreciate what the season was like for the Riders?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It will take a week because the Grey Cup is always tough when you might have been able to be there yourself. (General manager) Jeremy O’Day and I will go over the roster next week. Our coaches are helping evaluate the roster, ranking guys and giving us some feedback on what they saw. Where we felt we did some good things, we’ll try to keep them. Where we feel we need to make improvements, we’ll go from there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: You had the ball numerous times near Winnipeg’s goal line and didn’t score a touchdown. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/ottawa-redblacks/oh-what-a-rush-former-redblacks-rb-william-powell-loving-life-as-a-roughrider/wcm/c45dc1b4-886a-4373-ac64-f0214496b6de">Why didn’t you give the ball to William Powell, who had 12 rushing touchdowns in the regular season, and run it up the middle?</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>A: In defence of that, Winnipeg does a great job of short-yardage defence and clogging the middle with their guys. They have big, strong, physical guys and when you try to run inside, they make it tough. You try to give your offence the best play possible. Did we execute as well as we wanted to? No. Did we wish we had another crack at it and done it differently? Probably. Winnipeg deserves credit for really making it tough on offences to run the ball consistently in the way we normally do, which is straight up the middle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What was the Riders’ biggest strength this season?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It was our resiliency. We had a good group that found a way to win games all season. I thought we were going to do the same thing (Sunday).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What was your weakness?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: We have to get better in the red zone and that certainly showed up (Sunday). We have to do a better job at punching in touchdowns and not settling for field goals.</p>

          <b>Q: Riders quarterback Cody Fajardo revealed that he played with two torn oblique muscles on Sunday. If it was during the regular season, what would the recovery time be for that injury?</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>A: We rushed him back, but we knew that we needed him and he wanted to play. The reality was that was a four-to-six-week injury and he played in two.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What does it say about Fajardo doing what he did and was willing to do if you made it to the Grey Cup game?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: He’s a tough guy and a team-above self guy. He didn’t just say it, he lived it. He showed a lot of leadership and toughness.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: You inherited a coaching staff that was in place when you were named head coach in January. Will there be changes in that area this off-season?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I don’t know about that. I told the guys that I wouldn’t keep them in limbo. I will talk to the co-ordinators and see what they felt about their groups and how their position coaches meshed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: There were questions about some game-management scenarios that you said you had to be better at. How do analyze those so you develop as a head coach?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I had a couple of situations that I wish I had a do-over on. The tricky part is when you’re coaching and it’s related to the football-operations cap, because you only have so many coaches. The head coach has to be involved in one of the three phases and I was doing special teams. Because of that, I was concerned with what was going on on third down and I lost track of the time for a split-second or missed a substitution that I wouldn’t normally miss. That’s the challenge. I’ll look at it and make a few tweaks to the staff.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: What changes might you consider?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: (Special-teams assistant) Terry Eisler might be more involved in special teams so I can step back and do a little better job of clock management. The area I need to work on the most is to be a little more aware of clock management. I like to save timeouts because I think they are valuable. If we didn’t have the last one (Sunday), we wouldn’t have had the last drive. Still, I will analyze that. During the off-season, I will try to learn and talk to other coaches in this league and coaches down south and ask them what they do. One of my key priorities this off-season is to watch a lot of tape and have a better background on what we’re doing and help out the offensive and defensive coaches more.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: How do you deal with the expectations that have been created with Regina hosting the Grey Cup in 2020?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: That’s a challenge, because the Grey Cup is still next year and there is a lot that can happen between now and then. I’ll do my best to temper the excitement and anticipation. It will be a big year for us next year, not only in terms of the organization and the province, but for our team as well. We’re going to hit the ground running, build off what we felt was a good, solid year, and we hope to take it a little bit further.</p>
