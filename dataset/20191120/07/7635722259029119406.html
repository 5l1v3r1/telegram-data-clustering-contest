        <b>The number of smokers in Ireland has fallen from 20% of the population last year to 17% this year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The figure is featured in the latest Healthy Ireland Survey, which offers an annual snapshot of the health of Irish people.</p>
      <p>Over the past five years, smoking rates have fallen from 23% to 17% - an estimated 165,000 fewer smokers than there were in 2015.</p>

      <p>It shows that smoking rates remain highest among those aged 25 to 34 (26%), while rates are also higher in more deprived areas (24%) than in more affluent areas (14%).</p>
      <p>According to the survey, 46% of those who smoked in the past year made an attempt to quit during the past 12 months - with 25% of those attempts to quit said to have been successful.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the survey shows that 60% of people are overweight or obese.</p>
      <p>Only 46% of people (54% of men and 38% of women) are achieving the minimum recommended weekly level of physical activity - with time restrictions identified as the key barrier to increasing the level of activity.</p>
      <p>In terms of sleep, respondents to the survey reported an average of 7.1 hours of sleep on a typical weeknight.</p>
      <p>76% of people, meanwhile, rated the quality of sleep over the past month as either 'good' or 'very good'.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the findings, Kate O'Flaherty from the Department of Health said strict laws around smoking seem to be working.</p>
      <p>She explained: "The workplace ban... legislation banning smoking in cars where there's children... two years ago we brought in plain packaging.</p>
      <blockquote>"People are certainly responding to it - they see the warning pictures, and it makes them think about smoking and about quitting."</blockquote>
      <p>On the subject of the obesity statistics, Ms O'Flaherty added: "People who are overweight or obese are at huge risk of chronic diseases - from diabetes to heart disease to some cancers and dementia.</p>
      <p>"It is a cause for concern - the thing is now how do we in the coming years turn the tide on overweight and obesity, the way we are seeing that turning on smoking."</p>
