      <h1>Severe fire danger to sweep across NSW </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:41:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>NSW is facing widespread severe bushfire danger as predicted hot winds blowing in from the south present yet more challenging conditions for firefighters.</p>
      <p>Rural Fire Service NSW Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said a weather system coming in from South Australia will bring hot easterly winds on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We know over the coming days, particularly tomorrow, we’re expecting again widespread very high to severe conditions,” Mr Fitzsimmons told ABC TV.</p>
      <p>“This time, the indications are (it will be) the southern half of NSW with some of the more widespread, worst conditions. We’ve got a long way to go yet.”</p>
      <p>People have been urged to have their fire plans prepared and to know what to do if they come under threat.</p>
      <p>There are 12 total fire bans in place across the state.</p>
      <p>A severe fire danger rating is in place for 10 areas, including Illawarra/Shoalhaven, North Western and the Southern Riverina.</p>
      <p>“Now is the time to have a discussion with your family and know what you’ll do if fire threatens,” the Rural Fire Service tweeted.</p>
      <p>Most fires are at advice level on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>However, alerts have been elevated to watch and act for a near-20,000 hectare blaze at Ebor near Armidale, and a bushfire at Myall Creek Road in Bora Ridge, southeast of Casino which has consumed more than 30,000 hectares.</p>
      <p>The Rural Fire Service warned there will be “broad areas of very high and severe fire danger” on Thursday.</p>
      <p>There were 50 fires across the state on Wednesday afternoon, 24 of which were uncontained.</p>
      <p>More than 1000 firefighters remain in the field.</p>
      <p>Sydney’s air quality, which has deteriorated in a smoky haze in recent days, is unlikely to improve anytime soon as the fires continue, the Bureau of Meteorology said.</p>
      <p>There are also concerns that weekend thunderstorms, which won’t bring much rain, could see lightning strikes ignite additional fires.</p>
      <p>Six lives and 577 homes have been lost to date this fire season, with more than 420 homes lost in the past fortnight.</p>
      <p>Police, meanwhile, told reporters on Wednesday that legal action had been taken against 54 people since August for bushfire-related offences.</p>
      <p>Acting Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said those offences ranged from total fire ban breaches to deliberately lighting fires endangering life.</p>
