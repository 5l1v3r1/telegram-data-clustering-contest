        <b>IN HER previous line of work Leeann Dempster sometimes knew in 60 seconds who she wanted to work with.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She didn’t have to give a minute’s thought to decide Jack Ross was the right man for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14943/hibernian/">Hibs</a>.</p>

      <p>The Easter Road chief executive has made ex-<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14947/st-mirren/">St Mirren</a> and Sunderland gaffer Ross the fourth manager of her reign.</p>
      <p>Ross revealed he was put through a rigorous interview process before being offered the job.</p>
      <p>As <i>SunSport</i> revealed, John Kennedy was also considered, although Dempster would only admit that they had spoken to a couple of candidates.</p>
      <p>But it’s Ross who will be in the dugout for Saturday’s home clash with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14921/motherwell/">Motherwell</a> — and Dempster knew quickly he was the perfect fit.</p>

      <p>She said: “There’s a point in time when you meet somebody and there has to be a two-way conversation.</p>
      <p>“The club has to be right for that person as much as that person has to be right for the club. I certainly felt that when I met Jack.</p>
      <p>“We knew him from his time in Scotland. I’m excited to work with him.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s got lots of qualities he’ll bring to the club — hopefully straight away from this weekend.</p>
      <p>“That’s the most exciting thing, he fits us and we fit him. I don’t think you should underestimate that.</p>
      <p>“It’s also testament to Jack he came through that process. In my time at Hibernian he is head coach number four.</p>
      <p>“The processes have changed and, I think, improved. Jack was an early candidate because of his availability.</p>
      <p>“But he’s come through that process as he is an outstanding candidate. We were lucky in a way that he was available to us and we could have a quick conversation.”</p>

      <p>Asked about <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> No 2 Kennedy, Dempster said: “Lots of names were put to us in terms of who we did and didn’t speak to.</p>
      <p>“We’ve never commented on those. It’s only fair for anyone in the process, whether the names were correct or incorrect, that we don’t comment on them.</p>
      <p>“It’s fair to say we had a wide and varied number of conversations but we only spoke with a couple of people in earnest.</p>
      <p>“When we spoke with Jack we were able to distil the questions and conversations. There’s an element where you know if you can work with somebody.</p>
      <p>“Quite quickly you build an understanding and trust with somebody. Hopefully, in a relatively short period of time, we’ve started that. That’s important.</p>
      <p>“When I worked in the media I was told you knew who you could work with and go into business with in about sixty seconds. I still think that’s true.</p>
      <p>“You really get a sense of an individual when you have proper conversations with them — and with Jack it’s been all positive.”</p>
      <p>Dempster axed Paul Heckingbottom at the start of the month after only appointing him in February.</p>

      <p>It followed a dismal start to the season which saw the team win just one league game. Caretaker gaffer Eddie May oversaw a second victory against <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14925/st-johnstone/">St Johnstone</a> last time out.</p>
      <p>Dempster said: “Most decisions aren’t driven by the availability of candidates. They’re decisions football clubs don’t want to take.</p>
      <p>“People use words like ‘fired’ and ‘sacked’. These words have been fired at me in the last couple of weeks. It’s easy to say.</p>
      <p>“But when you’re actually having to have these conversations with people who you enjoy working with, who have worked really hard for the club, you don’t take decisions like that lightly.</p>
      <p>“I still think there’s been progress at the club. If you work in football it does come in peaks and troughs. You don’t win all the time.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had three head coaches in a calendar year. That’s obviously not a position any club wants to be in.</p>
      <p>“We hoped it would have worked differently with Paul. We obviously didn’t hire someone with the intention of him leaving in less than a year.</p>
      <p>“But that’s unfortunately the situation we found ourselves in. In terms of it being a difficult year — I work in football to try and make this club as good as it can be.</p>

      <p>“That’s always got to be my determination. I want to be part of winning things and exciting games.</p>
      <p>“Equally, if you want to be part of a football club, you’ve got to put your head above the parapet.”</p>
      <p>Ross was also linked with the vacancy at Edinburgh rivals Hearts but Dempster insists they didn’t rush his appointment because of that.</p>
      <p>She added: “It was a unique set of circumstances where both clubs were looking for a head coach at the same time.</p>
      <p>“But it didn’t drive our timeline or determination any faster. It takes as long as it takes. We weren’t trying to get to the finishing line before anyone else.</p>
      <p>“The clubs are having good conversations on other things. Not having a head coach at a football club, irrespective of what people think, isn’t a comfortable place to be.</p>
      <p>“You really don’t want that to be the case. You really want that person taking the team. So clubs don’t take these decisions lightly.</p>
      <p>“It was about weighing up the possibilities with Paul. We’d gone a full cycle of games and didn’t have the wins we wanted.</p>
      <p>“There were a lot of thin lines but you have to look at the next games that are coming.</p>
      <p>"If you go into a match, being honest, more with hope than expectation then that’s not a good place for us to be.</p>
      <p>“I don’t mean that with any disrespect to Paul. He was a fantastic coach who did brilliant things in the game. I hope he’ll go and do other things and I think he will.</p>
      <p>“We have to look at the here and now. It was a tough decision. Not an obvious one.</p>
      <p>“But we made it and now we have to move on. That’s life in football. It’s unforgiving.”</p>
