      <p>The president of the Oxford Union has quit over the ‘violent’ removal of a blind student from a debate event last month.</p>
      <p>PhD student Ebenezer Azamati, 25, was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/blind-student-dragged-oxford-debate-ankles-11172361/"> filmed being dragged</a> from his seat by security guards, visibly distressed as he tried to resist being forced out.</p>
      <p>But instead of giving an apology, Union president Brendan McGrath called a disciplinary hearing against him, where it was claimed that Mr Azamati had ‘behaved violently’ as he was being removed from the building.</p>
      <p>Footage of the incident sparked a global outcry, including condemnation from Oxford University who said they ‘share the widespread outrage’.</p>
      <p>McGrath was suspended from the union for two terms but that decision was overturned, sparking students at the union to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/bid-oust-oxford-union-president-blind-student-dragged-ankles-11180754/">lodge a motion calling for his impeachment.</a></p>

      <p>Last night, in a statement posted to Facebook, McGrath announced his resignation and said in a statement he was quitting because it was his ‘job to ensure that every Member feels welcome at the Oxford Union’.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘For all of my shortcomings, and all of my mistakes, I apologise profusely and unqualifiedly.’</p>

      <p>Mr Azamati, an international relations scholar from Ghana, said his treatment left him feeling ‘unwelcome in the union, Oxford and even the country’.</p>
      <p>He successfully appealed on Saturday against what he told the BBC were claims of ‘false violent disorder’ by the union.</p>
      <p>The footage of the incident shows he was manhandled out of the Oxford Union debating chamber by his feet and ejected from the building.</p>
      <p>He had arrived to the debate early to reserve a seat as he was worried there were no special provisions for disabled students.</p>
      <p>He placed a book on an accessible seat near the entrance to the chamber to reserve it and went back to his college for dinner.</p>
      <p>When he returned, he was denied entry, but attempted to sit down in his reserved seat.</p>

      <p>Oxford University said in a statement: ‘We share the widespread outrage regarding the unacceptable treatment of Ebenezer Azamati, a member of our University community, at the Oxford Union. Ebenezer’s college and the University are working to fully support him.</p>
      <p>‘The Union is an entirely independent club not governed by the University, but this student’s treatment goes against our culture of inclusivity and tolerance – we are pressing the Union for answers on how they plan to remedy the issue and ensure this does not happen in future.’</p>
      <p>The Oxford Union operates independent of the university and has hosted speakers and debates since 1823.</p>
