        <b>Julia Roberts was reportedly the original favourite to play Harriet Tubman in a biopic, joining the growing list of problematic revelations this week.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cynthia-erivo/">Cynthia Erivo</a> is currently playing the black slave abolitionist in Kasi Lemons’ movie Harriet, which hits cinemas this week and recounts the incredible story of Harriet’s escape from slavery, before going on to free others using the Underground Railway network of safe houses.</p>
      <p>However, it’s emerged that Pretty Woman actress Julia was the first name in the hat to take on the iconic historical figure – despite the fact that it would see Julia in blackface.</p>
      <p>Gregory Allen, screenwriter and producer of Harriet, made the revelation in a <a href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/interview_screenwriter_gregory-allen-howard">Q&amp;A with Focus Features</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Recalling how he began working on the script in 1994, the filmmaker said: ‘I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, “This script is fantastic. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman”.’</p>

      <p>Seriously, how did anyone think that was a great idea?</p>
      <p>Gregory continued: ‘When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn’t be Harriet, the executive responded, “It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference”.’</p>

      <p>Ah, Hollywood and their problematic ideas.</p>
      <p>Julia, 52, has not commented on the claims but one fan predicted: ‘I’m guessing Julia Roberts would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.’</p>
      <p>Wondering how harrowing scenes of Harriet’s pain while being enslaved would play out, another weighed in: ‘I’m sorry, but I’m just imagining Julia Roberts screaming, “TO FREEDOM!” in blackface and…’</p>
      <p>Another quipped: ‘If you’re chasing a Hollywood dream and feel doubtful you’ll ever make it, remember there are executives getting paid s**t loads of money to suggest JULIA ROBERTS should play Harriet Tubman. A jar of cockroaches is more qualified than some of these people so DON’T GIVE UP.’</p>

      <p>Seeing the humorous side, one joked: ‘They said Julia Roberts OVER SCARLETT JOHANSSON, our melanin queen!?’</p>
      <p>The role of Harriet has been shrouded in controversy for some time.</p>
      <p>Producers received <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/cynthia-erivo-admits-hurt-immense-backlash-casting-harriet-tubman-biopic-10916865/">backlash for casting Cynthia in the role of the African-American activist</a> in light of her African-British heritage.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Addressing the criticism, Cynthia recently told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘At first I was hurt because I’m human.</p>
      <p>‘But I understand where it’s coming from because I feel like it’s coming from a lack – we don’t get roles like this very often, roles like this don’t come along as often as they should, I’m hoping they’ll start to come along more often now.’</p>
