      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> is definitely back on form in I’m a Celebrity, and may have just won the internet by singing Kylie Jenner’s Rise and Shine <i>right</i> in front of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>.</p>
      <p>Hey, it’s an opportunity too good to miss, to be fair!</p>
      <p>The Geordie presenter and co-star Declan Donnelly were seen at the end of Tuesday night’s episode heading into the camp to reveal who was doing the latest bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>So seeing as the campmates had just got up…the joke was there for the taking.</p>
      <p>Confirming it was deliberate, Ant later responded to a fan who was cracking up at the moment, and had written online: ‘ANT DID NOT JUST SING RISE AND SHINE IN FRONT OF CAITLYN JENNER OMG STOP.’</p>
      <p>‘Yes I did!!!!,’ he sent with some cry-laugh emojis. ‘Twitter is LOVING it!’</p>
      <p>You’ve got to shoot your shot when you can, we guess!</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/kylie-jenners-rise-shine-song-10940236/">‘Rise and Shine’ meme</a> first came to light when Kylie shared a video to her YouTube channel of her giving fans a guided tour around the offices for her Kylie Cosmetics brand.</p>
      <p>Toward the end of the video, the 22-year-old later heads off to wake up her one-year-old daughter, Stormi, and as she enters her bedroom, she can be heard singing ‘rise and shine’ to her.</p>
      <p>Since then, the makeup mogul’s singing has gone viral, with fans across the world sharing it on social media, and other celebrities such as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/19/miley-cyrus-and-cody-simpson-perform-their-own-acoustic-take-on-kylie-jenners-viral-rise-and-shine-meme-10947855/">Miley Cyrus and Cody Simpson performing it</a> together and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/ariana-grande-wants-sample-kylie-jenner-singing-rise-shine-stormi-absolutely-need-10938644/">Ariana Grande wanting to sample it for a song</a>.</p>
