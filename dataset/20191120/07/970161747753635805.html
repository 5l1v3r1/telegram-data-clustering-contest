      <p>Rihanna is one of the most well-known celebrities around, thanks to her massive singing career, constantly sold-out beauty range, history-making clothing line – and she can act, too.</p>
      <p>However, Helena Bonham Carter revealed there were some communication issues between the pair while starring on Ocean’s 8 together.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on The Late Show, The Crown actress took a second to spill all the tea on some of her biggest co-stars so far.</p>
      <p>And, while the 53-year-old was full of praise for the We Found Love singer, she didn’t quite understand some of what she said.</p>
      <p>‘She’s amazing, she’s a goddess. She looks extraordinary,’ she told host Stephen Colbert. ‘I could never understand what she said though. We speak totally different languages.</p>
      <p>‘But I love her, and she’s amazing to look at — really good actress too, and then she’s a great designer.’</p>

      <p>Colin Firth, who starred opposite her in The King’s Speech, didn’t fare any better.</p>

      <p>‘Love dearly, talks too much,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>And Helena revealed that Harry Potter’s Daniel Radcliffe recites poetry backstage and is very useful for ‘holding her drinks’.</p>
      <p>Discussing how sensitive the 30-year-old is, she continued: ‘He’s got nice manners, too. He loves poems, and he writes them. He also quotes poems.</p>
      <p>‘He’s really handy because I like my tea and my coffee and my Diet Coke and things, and he’d hold them all for me. So he was really helpful.’</p>
      <p>Good to know…</p>

      <p>Helena recently made headlines as she opened up <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/helena-bonham-carter-claims-princess-margarets-ghost-gave-her-permission-to-star-in-the-crown-season-3-10877572/">about her role as Princess Margaret in series three of The Crown</a> – which is on Netflix now.</p>
      <p>In fact, she claimed that she spoke <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/helena-bonham-crater-reveals-ghost-princess-margaret-told-better-one-crown-season-3-11065044/">to the ghost of the late Royal before taking on the part</a>.</p>
      <p>Clearing up the rumours while appearing on The Graham Norton Show, she admitted: ‘I actually went to see a friend about something else, but she has a talent for mediumship and she suddenly said, “Margaret is here. Does that mean anything?”</p>
      <p>‘I hadn’t actually said yes [to the part] yet, but thought I’d ask her if I should take the role and she said, “You’ll be better than the other one”.</p>

      <p>‘There was actually someone else up for the part and it was typical of Margaret.</p>
      <p>‘I’d met her a few times and you never really knew where you were with her, she had a way of complimenting and putting you down at the same time.’</p>
      <p>No communication issues there, then…</p>
