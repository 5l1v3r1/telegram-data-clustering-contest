      <p>When Dig Deep won this year’s Karrakatta Plate at Ascot Racecourse, the lifelong dream of having a city winner came true for part-owner and racing enthusiast Tony Leighton.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Dig Deep will be having his first race since his big win in April in the group 2, $500,000 WA Guineas at Ascot over 1600m.</p>

      <p>The day promises to be an emotional one for the Leighton family; just weeks after Dig Deep's triumph in the Karrakatta, Tony Leighton lost his battle with terminal cancer.</p>
      <p>The Leightons hope Dig Deep can notch another win to honour the man who was much loved and well known within racing circles.</p>
      <p>Sired by Deep Field out of Lucky Ana and trained by brothers Dan and Ben Pearce, the horse promises to be well backed, with legendary WA jockey Damien Oliver booked for the ride.</p>
      <p>The WA Guineas is part of the 2019 TABtouch Masters, the world’s only single-track festival featuring a group 1 race worth $1 million or more over three consecutive Saturdays.</p>
      <p>Perth’s oldest group 1 race, the $1 million Railway Stakes, is also on this Saturday before Australia's last group 1 sprint of the year, the $1 million Winterbottom Stakes, takes centre stage the following Saturday.</p>
      <p>The carnival wraps up the following weekend with the highlight race the $1m Kingston Town Classic, the southern hemisphere’s richest group 1 race over 1800 metres.</p>
      <p>Throughout the course of the three-meet carnival, Perth Racing's 1000 employees will serve more than 4500 bottles of champagne, shuck more than 550 dozen oysters and dish up 9000 gourmet meals.</p>
      <p>In addition to the three group 1 feature races, 11 of the 27 races over the three-weekend TABtouch Masters carry black type status, with the carnival set to attract tens of thousands of local, national and international visitors.</p>
      <p>The first of these, the elite thoroughbreds, arrived in Perth by plane on Tuesday and were joined by Oliver, Australia’s best-known rider, an eight-time Scobie Breasley winner and member of racing’s Hall of Fame.</p>

      <p>Each meet of the Masters has a special theme, from the quality racing for the purists on 23 November for Kirin-Railway Stakes Day; high fashion for the ladies with the Crown Perth Winterbottom Stakes Day, which also features the final of the WA Fashions on the Field competition; and the Magic Millions Kingston Town Classic Day.</p>
      <p>Other highlights include the match-up between jockeys Craig Williams, who won the Melbourne Cup this year aboard Vow and Declare, and WA's Damian Lane, who took the Australian racing scene by storm in 2019 winning the Golden Slipper, Caulfield Cup and Cox Plate.</p>
      <p>Perth Racing managing director John Yovich said the fourth Masters carnival was bigger and better than ever.</p>
      <p>"We have attracted some phenomenal talent to race in the festival, it really will be black type racing at its best," he said.</p>
      <p>Perth Racing has this year introduced a Masters pass that gives visitors entry to all three race days for $50, while entry to special events on course such as Enclosure on the Deck and the new Kirin Jokki Club are also available.</p>
      <p>The Winterbottom Stakes day in week two will have an off-track focus on food and wine, with Ascot’s restaurants serving up the best of WA’s regional produce and wines, while a Stella Bella tasting exhibit will also be set up.</p>
      <p>The highlight of this day, however, are the finals of the WA Fashions on the Field.</p>
