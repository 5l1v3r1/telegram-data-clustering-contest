      <p>Alec Burks scored 29 points as the Golden State Warriors beat the Memphis Grizzlies 114-95 to snap a seven game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Glenn Robinson III added 20, while Marquese Chriss and Eric Paschall added 17 each for the Warriors in a game where the result was rarely in doubt.</p>
      <p>Memphis reduced the deficit to single digits late in the third quarter, but Golden State were untroubled by their opponents in the fourth.</p>

      <p>The Warriors are still bottom of the Western Conference but the win will give them some hope of moving out of the wooden spoon slot.</p>
      <p>Carmelo Anthony’s high profile return to basketball, and his debut with the Trail Blazers, did not go to plan as Portland were beaten 115-104 by the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
      <p>After sitting out more than a year, it was not surprising the 10-time All-Star seemed a bit rusty, but he also showed some of his old spark in getting 10 points, four rebounds and one block.</p>

      <p>Jrue Holiday starred for the Pelicans with 22 points, 10 assists and five rebounds, with Brandon Ingram scoring 21 points and helping himself to seven rebounds and five assists.</p>
      <p>The Sacramento Kings fought off a strong second-half comeback by the Phoenix Suns to win 120-116 at Golden 1 Center.</p>
      <p>Bogdan Bogdanovic scored a career-high 31 points for the Kings, who have won six of their last eight games since going 5-0 down at the start of the season.</p>

      <p>Devin Booker scored 30 points for the Suns, who have now lost three of their last four games.</p>
      <p>In the final game of the night, the Los Angeles Lakers claimed a 112-107 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>LeBron James impressed with 25 points, 10 assists and 11 rebounds as Anthony Davis top scored with 34 points.</p>
