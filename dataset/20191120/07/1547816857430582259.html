      <p>Equations change in the blink of an eye in Bigg Boss 13 house. Best friends turn foes in no time just like Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla. These two had a nasty fight yesterday that shocked all the contestants of the house. Even their fans are in shock with Twitter being divided into two. Now, it seems Sidharth Shukla's team will also get divided into two. So far, there have been two teams in the house - Team Sidharth Shukla and Team Paras Chhabra. But we guess now there's a way for Team Asim Riaz too.</p>
      <p>A new promo of Bigg Boss 13 that has hit the internet sees Himanshi Khurana, Shefali Jariwala and Asim Riaz discussing Sidharth Shukla's behaviour. We hear Shefali saying that Sidharth feels he is the leader of the pack and Asim saying that 'mein dikhaunga ab usse'. This could possibly mean that there is a new team forming in the house and that is of Asim Riaz, Himanshi Khurana and Shefali Jariwala.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, we see Sidharth and Shehnaaz discussing the same with the latter saying that it will be fun if Asim plays his game solo. Well, it appears that the dynamics of Bigg Boss 13 are soon going to change. Sidharth Shukla had a very strong supporter in Asim Riaz however, it seems now he has more enemies inside the house than friends. Arti Singh too is quite irked with Mr Shukla for the way he talks.</p>
