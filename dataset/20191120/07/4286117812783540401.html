      <p>In his letter recommending imposition of President's Rule in Maharashtra, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari had said he cannot rule out the possibility of horse-trading, corruption and other illegal means being used to garner support if a floor test is held in the Maharashtra assembly under present circumstances.</p>
      <p>The letter, a copy of which has been accessed by India Today TV, was tabled in the Rajya Sabha today by the central government for Parliament's approval, as mandated by law.</p>
      <p>The letter was sent by Governor Koshiyari to the Union Home Ministry, following which President's Rule was imposed in Maharashtra. The report was sent after no party or alliance staked claim to form government in the state even weeks after the assembly election results were declared on October 24.</p>
      <p>While recommending imposition of President's Rule in Maharashtra, Governor Koshiyari in his letter said he is aware that floor test is only way to ensure that a government enjoys support of the Assembly.</p>
      <blockquote>There are eminent possibilities of horse trading, corruption and other illegal means being adopted by the concerned persons to garner support.<cite>- Maharashtra Governor BS Koshiyari</cite></blockquote>
      <p>However, the developments in the state after the election results have been such that "an occasion to have a floor test has not even arisen in the state" because no party or alliance has come forward to stake claim on government formation by demonstrating it has the support of 145 elected members (145 is the majority mark in the 288-memeber Maharashtra assembly).</p>
      <p>"Presently, permitting such a floor test for anybody is neither feasible nor practical and would largely be an academic exercise," the governor wrote in his letter.</p>
      <p>"I am alive to the fact that in case of such a misadventure of having a floor test, there are eminent possibilities of horse trading, corruption and other illegal means being adopted by the concerned persons to garner support, which in my view must be ruled out under any circumstances and at any cost," Koshiyari wrote in his letter.</p>
      <p>He also said he is aware that repeated meeting, some very lengthy, have taken place in Mumbai, Delhi and Jaipur between leaders of various parties.</p>
      <p>"I need not go into the reasons as to why there is no unanimity amongst then in the formation of government. Not in supporting each other in order to form a stable government in Maharashtra."</p>
      <p>Koshiyari said he had to take the decision to recommend President's Rule because even though he explored various option of government formation by asking the BJP, the Shiv Sena and the NCP (the three largest parties in the Maharashtra assembly) if they want to stake claim to form a government, but all attempts went unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>The letter talks at length about the written and in-person communications the governor had with leaders of the BJP, the Shiv Sena and the NCP after the assembly election results were declared.</p>
