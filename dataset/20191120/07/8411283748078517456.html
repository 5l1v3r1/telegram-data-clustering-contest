      <p>The three-month average of worldwide billings of North American equipment manufacturers climbed to a 14-month high of US$2.11 billion in October 2019, according to SEMI.</p>
      <p>The billings figure is 7.7% higher than the revised level of US$1.96 billion in September, and is 3.9% above the October 2018 billings level of US$2.03 billion, SEMI said.</p>
      <p>"Monthly billings of North American equipment manufacturers registered their first year-over-year increase since October 2018," said Ajit Manocha, president and CEO of SEMI. "Equipment billings are accelerating on the strength of memory inventory drawdowns and foundry investments in leading-edge equipment."</p>
