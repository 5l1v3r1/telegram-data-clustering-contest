      <p>The launch was supported by Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, Judge President of the Mpumalanga Division of the High Court, Francis Legodi, as well as other judges and representatives from organisations in the legal fraternity, such as the Black Lawyers Association, National Association of Democratic Lawyers (Nadel) and the Mbombela Attorneys Association.</p>
      <blockquote>“The launch is a big milestone for justice,” Adv Zodwa Gumede of the Mpumalanga Bar, who organised the event, told Lowvelder.<br/>“The people of Mpumalanga will no longer have to travel hundreds of kilometres to Pretoria or Johannesburg for the services of advocates, as the Mpumalanga Bar is home to skilled advocates. This means that the constitutional imperative of access to justice is no longer a pipe dream, but a reality for the people of the province.”</blockquote>
