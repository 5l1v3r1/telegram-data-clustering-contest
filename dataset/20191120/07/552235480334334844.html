      <h2>The serial offender was sentenced at Hamilton Sheriff Court.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Hamilton Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/hamilton-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A serial offender who showed off a knife in a Hamilton store has been sent to prison for 16 months.</p>
      <p>William McInulty revealed the blade when he stripped to the waist after he heard staff talking about him.</p>
      <p>McInulty, 28, a prisoner, was sentenced at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>He admitted having a knife at B&amp;M Bargains in Douglas Park Retail Park on September 12.</p>
      <p>McInulty also admitted resisting arrest, shouting abuse and making threats.</p>
      <p>Scott King, prosecuting, said staff were warned in a phone call from a neighbouring store that the accused had entered B&amp;M Bargains and might have a knife.</p>
      <p>Mr King explained: “McInulty appeared to overhear this conversation. He took off his jacket and t-shirt, exposing a knife that had been concealed in the waistband of his trousers.</p>
      <p>“Staff pressed the panic button immediately and a member of the public also contacted the police.</p>
      <p>“Officers arrived and approached the accused from different areas of the store.</p>
      <p>“He was arrested and began to resist and tried to break free. Five officers were involved.</p>
      <p>“He was searched and a kitchen knife with a six-inch blade was seized.</p>
      <p>“McAnulty then began to shout, swear and threaten the police officers.”</p>
      <p>Solicitor Jackson Bateman said his client has mental health difficulties and was at a “particularly low point” at the time.</p>
      <p>Mr Bateman added: “There was an issue with homelessness and he was misusing heroin and valium.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar noted that the accused was jailed for four years in 2014 for assault and robbery involving a knife.</p>
      <p>The sheriff told him: “There has been further offending since and you have been put under supervision and given a restriction of liberty order, measures which are designed to prevent further offending.</p>
      <p>“You are clearly a person who is not averse to using a knife.</p>
      <p>“This must have been a very frightening experience for those in the shop.”</p>
