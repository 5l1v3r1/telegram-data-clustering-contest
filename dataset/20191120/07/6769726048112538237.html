      <p>THE screen is up and film is about to start rolling for Telethon 7 Community Cinemas’ first season at the ECU Joondalup Pines outdoor theatre.</p>
      <p>Founder and volunteer event co-ordinator Ken Gibbons said they had “long been asked by people in the northern corridor to go up there”.</p>
      <p>“We know people are already responding well, with advanced purchases looking positive despite not much exposure,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pleasing outcome so far and we are very hopeful the northern corridor will embrace what we’re trying to do.”</p>
      <p>Previously a venue for Perth Festival, Mr Gibbons said they were grateful for the opportunity to be able to use the theatre to continue to raise funds for Telethon kids’ charities.</p>

      <p>“We have moved away from the arthouse-style films to a more broader style,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There will be the odd retrospective movie but mainly we will be showing current films.”</p>

      <p>He said other changes included the reduction of the sling back chairs to increase the picnic area.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to bring a more relaxed, picnic-type atmosphere where families and friends can come to catch up socially,” Mr Gibbons said.</p>
      <p>They have also introduced a bar and candy bar and flexible ticketing where beanbags and food can be pre-ordered, vouchers never expire and there are no additional fees for tickets bought online.</p>
      <p>Tickets can also be changed up to 45 minutes before gates open on the day of a screening if someone is no longer able to attend.</p>
      <p>“We want to be patron-friendly and respect that people are spending their cash with us so we don’t want to deny them being able to change things if they need to,” Mr Gibbons said.</p>
      <p>Now in its 19th season, Telethon 7 Community Cinemas welcomes ECU Joondalup Pines as its fourth location, joining Burswood, Bassendean and Murdoch.</p>
      <p>“The organisation began on a dare after I complained at a dinner with friends as to the poor standard of outdoor cinemas generally in Perth at the time and the lack of family-focused venues,” Mr Gibbons said.</p>
      <p>“The focus then became about helping organisations improve the lives of kids in a health or physical ability crisis – partly because of having a stutter and being subjected to schoolyard ridicule – so there was a desire to try and minimise or prevent similar treatment of kids today.”</p>

      <p>All four cinemas are completely run by volunteers, with no external financial support or grants other than from sponsors.</p>
      <p>“Having four locations involves having a team of over 600 volunteers which we expect will eventually hit 700 this season, with Joondalup requiring us to source an extra 150 volunteers,” Mr Gibbons said.</p>
      <p>“The majority are not connected to any of our charities – they are just people with good hearts wanting to make a difference.</p>
      <p>“In 18 seasons we have never lost a screening due to lack of volunteers on the night – such is their dedication.</p>
      <p>“We have raised $9 million in those 18 years, of which $8 million has come in the last 11 years, and we support eight children’s charities directly whilst providing a funding platform for schools, clubs and others.”</p>
      <p>ECU Joondalup Pines launches its summer film season on Wednesday, November 27, with the modern day murder-mystery Knives Out by acclaimed writer and director Rian Johnson.</p>
      <p>The blockbuster features a big name cast including Toni Collette, Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer.</p>
      <p>Gates open 6.30pm, with the screening from 7.45pm.</p>
      <p>Tickets from <a href="http://www.communitycinemas.com.au/">www.communitycinemas.com.au</a>.</p>
      <p>Burswood will then launch on Friday, November 28, followed by Bassendean on December 5 and Murdoch on December 12.</p>
