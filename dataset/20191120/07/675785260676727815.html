      <h1>Jose Mourinho's comments on Mauricio Pochettino and Harry Kane after Champions League final</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been named new Tottenham manager after Spurs sacked Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night - and he had plenty to say earlier this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:27:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:27</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>New Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho had plenty to say after Spurs were beaten in the Champions League final by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in June.</p>
      <p>Mourinho commented on both predecessor Mauricio Pochettino - who was sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> on Tuesday night - and Harry Kane who the self-styled Special One will now be relying on to bang in the goals to get Spurs back in contention for a top-four spot.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Mourinho was announced as new manager at Tottenham early on Wednesday morning ahead of their trip to the London Stadium to face <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>Mourinho worked as a pundit alongside ex-Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger on beIN Sports for the Champions League final which Liverpool won 2-0 in Madrid.</p>

      <p>Despite Spurs' defeat - Mourinho insisted fans should still be proud of Pochettino for steering the club to the final.</p>
      <p>“That’s the drama of football and sometimes it’s not fair," Mourinho said of Pochettino's trophy-less stint with Spurs.</p>
      <p>"Mauricio has had four very good years at Spurs, brings them to the final for the Champions League, and he’s still waiting for the first trophy of his career.</p>

      <p>“I feel very sorry for Mauricio but I think the English supporter is very loyal and they know when people give everything. They are a bit different than in other countries when everything is just about winning.</p>
      <p>“I think the Tottenham fans are proud of their team. They still look to this team and this manager as a historical team for them.</p>
      <p>“They will feel some love at home and next season when they go back to business, they will go with the pride of what they did and not in a low.”</p>
      <p>Spurs talisman Kane had been injured in the run-up to the final with some suggesting he had been rushed back too quickly.</p>
      <p>He turned in a largely ineffective display in the Spanish capital - and Mourinho gave his take on the England striker's display in the immediate aftermath.</p>
      <p>"Harry Kane was hidden all the time," he said. "He normally drops back, comes in between the lines, normally he’s the link player.</p>
      <p>"He receives the ball from one side, he goes between the lines, he turns, plays with the other full back, arrives in the box. Nothing of this dynamic yet."</p>
