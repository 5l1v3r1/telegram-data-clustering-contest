      <h1>Nearly 500% increase in number of children prescribed psychiatric medication</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:41:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The number of children who have been prescribed psychiatric medication has increased by nearly 500% over the past decade.</p>
      <p>The rise amounts to more than 5,300 medical-card patients.</p>
      <p>A new study by UCD and Jigsaw yesterday shows <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/new-survey-shows-alarming-growth-in-levels-of-anxiety-and-depression-among-young-965234.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">one in four young people in Ireland suffers from anxiety</a>.</p>
      <p>Today, new figures released by the HSE under the Freedom of Information Act shed a light on the number of people in Ireland who are being treated with medication for mental health issues.</p>
      <p>In 2009, 1,150 children under 15 were prescribed psychiatric medication under the medical card scheme.</p>
      <p>But this has increased noticeably every year since then, rising to just under 6,500 children last year.</p>
      <p>Brendan Kelly, Professor of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin, says a recruitment crisis in the HSE's child and adolescent services is a factor in the trend.</p>
      <p>"We know referrals to child and adolescent psychiatry have increased by 40% over the past six or seven years or so," said Prof Kelly.</p>
      <p>"And the child and adolescent mental health services have just 57% of the staff that the national policy recommends they should have.</p>
      <p>"So in this situation, you often see an increase in both referrals and an increase in prescribing."</p>
      <p>The trend is out of sync with the same stats for the general population, which has seen only a 12% rise in the same time frame.</p>
