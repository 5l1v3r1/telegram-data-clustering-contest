      <p>Stormzy’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a> headlining set was a major cultural moment and one of the most memorable festival performances this decade.</p>
      <p>But at the time, the grime star himself didn’t think so.</p>
      <p>In fact, Stormzy was so upset with the show that he cried ‘for an hour’ after leaving the stage.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, real name Michael Omari, has revealed that his in-ear monitors ‘blew’ 20 minutes into his Friday night headlining stint on the Pyramid Stage this year, leaving him without sound for the rest of the set.</p>

      <p>The Vossi Bop star told Q magazine: ‘It was the most difficult thing I’ve ever done. When I walked off stage I thought I’d f***ed it.</p>
      <p>‘I thought it was the worst thing I’d ever done. I came off stage and thought I’d totally, absolutely blown it. I was crying for, like, an hour. I was in hysterics. Heartbroken, man.’</p>

      <p>However, Glastonbury organiser Emily Eavis gave him a memory stick containing his set after he ‘[calmed] down for an hour’ and Stormzy soon realised that we had no clue his in-ears were broken.</p>
      <p>Stormzy said: ‘About halfway through I was, like, “S***, it all went all right”.’</p>

      <p>The star was joined during the set by Coldplay’s Chris Martin, BAME dance group Ballet Black and rappers Dave and Fredo, while Stormzy played a speech by Labour MP David Lammy on the disproportionate number of BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) people in the criminal justice system.</p>
      <p>Stormzy became the first black British solo artist to headline the festival when he was announced as 2019 headliner alongside The Killers and The Cure.</p>
      <p>It has set a high bar for the 2020 festival, which marks 50 years of Glasto.</p>
      <p>So far, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/paul-mccartney-basically-confirms-headlining-glastonbury-2020-rather-cryptic-message-11175429/">Paul McCartney has been unveiled as one of the headliners,</a> while Diana Ross will take up the spot on the legends stage.</p>
