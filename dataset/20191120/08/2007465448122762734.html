      <p>With the return of the Mitsubishi L300, and Isuzu recently launching their own business hauler called the Traviz, the Hyundai H-100 is suddenly facing competition from different brands. To combat this, Hyundai Philippines launched the H-100 Cargo</p>
      <p>Also known as 'KapitanKargo', the new H-100 variant is a dedicated cargo van that can move and haul your business with ease, and then some.</p>

      <p>Instead of a passenger cab at the back, the KapitanKargo has a cargo box that measures 3050mm long, 1700mm wide and 1730mm tall externally. In addition, its interior dimensions measure 2860mm by 1360mm and by 1680mm. It also has a generous 1 ton carrying capacity, enough to lug various types of cargo, and the van has 185mm of ground clearance.</p>

      <p>Driving the Hyundai H-100 Cargo is, you guessed it, a turbo-diesel engine. Like the rest of the range, it's powered by a 2.5-liter four-cylinder CRDi engine. It puts out 130 PS at 3800 rpm along with 255 Nm of torque from 1500 – 3500 rpm. Power is then sent to the rear wheels via six-speed manual transmission.</p>
      <p>Despite being a workhorse, Hyundai made sure it has comfort features available for the driver and two front passengers. It comes with air-conditioning, a 1-DIN head unit that has AM/FM radio, CD, USB and Aux, and an elevated gear shifter.</p>
