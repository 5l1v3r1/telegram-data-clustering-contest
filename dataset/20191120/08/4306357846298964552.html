      <h2>Lucas Torreira's agent says the Uruguay international is 'no longer at ease' under Unai Emery at Arsenal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/football-transfers/" target="_blank">Transfer Agent</a></address>
      <h3>Lucas Torreira is “no longer at ease” at Arsenal under Unai Emery, according to the Uruguay international’s agent.</h3>
      <p>The Arsenal star is contending with speculation surrounding his future at the north London outfit after falling down the pecking order at The Emirates.</p>
      <p>Torreira has struggled to tie down a regular starting spot in the Gunners team, while Emery has used the Uruguayan star in a more advanced midfield role when he has featured.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has only started four of their 12 Premier League games this season, while Torreira has made a further five appearances from the bench.</p>
      <p>The South American midfielder has been limited to less than 400 minutes despite the north London side’s well-documented struggles.</p>
      <p>Torreira has proven an instant hit with supporters thanks to his combative style of play and never-say-die attitude in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>His agent Pablo Bentancour says Torreira’s change of role has “hurt” the Arsenal midfielder, but insists his client doesn’t want to leave The Emirates.</p>
      <p>“I must say that the change of role has hurt him,” agent Pablo Bentancur told <i>Calciomercato</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/lucas-torreiras-agent-responds-rumours-wants-leave-arsenal-unai-emery-11177689/?ito=cbshare">Metro</a>. “He’s no longer at ease and we hope that things can change.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether Torreira could leave Arsenal, Bentancour added: “We have no problem with Arsenal, only words of thanks.</p>
      <p>“They allowed Lucas to compete in the Premier League, he has always shown great confidence. Clearly, there is interest for Torreira, especially from Spanish clubs.</p>
      <p>“However, I have never sat down with any club to talk about a transfer. This is because of the great respect we have for the Gunners and their general manager Raul Sanllhei.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal signed Torreira in a £25m deal from Serie A giants Sampdoria last year before the Uruguayan impressed at the World Cup in Russia.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are in sixth position in the Premier League table and eight points adrift of defending champions Manchester City in fourth spot.</p>
