      <p>The benchmark Sensex touched a new high of 40,816.38 during the morning session on Wednesday, primarily led by strong gains in index heavyweight Reliance Industries (RIL).</p>
      <p>At 1.30 p.m., the 30-share Sensex was trading at 40,698.25, up 228.55 points or 0.56%. The broader Nifty was also trading above the psychological 12,000-mark at 12,002.65, up 62.55 points or 0.52%.</p>
      <p>The gains were primarily on the back of the RIL, which touched a 52-week high of ₹1,571.85 during the morning session on reports that the telecom arm Reliance Jio will increase tariffs.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, foreign brokerages like Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse have a very bullish view on the stock post the tariff hike.</p>
      <p>Apart from the RIL, the Sensex pack saw notable gains in constituents like IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharmaceutical, HDFC Bank, Maruti Suzuki and L&amp;T.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, investor sentiment has received a boost after reports that the government is actively looking at divestment in public sector undertakings in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Further, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turning bullish on Indian equities has also acted as a catalyst in lifting investor sentiments. In November, FPIs are currently net buyers at nearly ₹13,000 crore.</p>
      <p>In October, FPIs were net buyers at ₹12,368 crore.</p>
