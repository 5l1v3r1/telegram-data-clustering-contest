      <h1>Where did the ‘Reopen Closed Tab’ button go in Google Chrome?</h1>

      <p>If you’re like me, you’re a serial user of the “Reopen Closed Tab” option in Google Chrome. Whether it be close-tab-happy-fingers or just carelessness, I find myself constantly needing to reopen closed tabs. It was so part of my daily Chrome routine that one recent change was a bit jarring for me — Google decided to move this option.</p>
      <p>In a recent <a href="http://9to5google.com/guides/google-chrome">Google Chrome</a> stable update, Google decided to move this major functionality. It used to be that you could right click anywhere in the tab pane at the top of the Chrome browser — even on a currently open tab — and you could choose to “Reopen Closed Tab”. Now, though, Google has made it so that the menu options when right-clicking a tab only have to do with that tab. You must <b>right-click the tab pane itself to reopen a tab</b>. CMD-Shift-T and CTRL-Shift-T also work, as they always have.</p>
      <p>You can see in the screenshot at the top of this post how this feature used to appear in Chrome. The below screenshot represents the new location for this option…</p>

      <p>In one sense, this change makes sense. If you’re right-clicking a tab, the context menu should represent that tab. But it’s also a functionality that has lived in that context menu for a very long time, and one that many Chrome users have gotten used to.</p>
      <p>Additionally, my issue — and often the reason I’m going all-out closing tons of excess tabs that then need to be reopened — is having too many tabs open. So for me, I rarely have any room to right-click the main tab pane… it’s filled with a dozen or more tabs. In my case, I’m having to learn to right-click a small open space on the top area rather than just a random tab to reopen an accidentally closed one.</p>
      <p>At first, I found this change really frustrating — I thought Google removed this option completely and left me dependent on a keyboard shortcut of the History section of the main Chrome menu to find recently closed tabs. Thankfully, that’s not the case; this is just a practical change that will require a little relearning!</p>
