      <h2>The toddler got her leg stuck in an Cuggl stairgate after Argos recalled several of its models for failing EU safety tests - including one meant to prevent the bars being set too far apart</h2>

      <p>A two-year-old got so badly stuck in a baby stairgate that has just been recalled firefighters had to be called in to free her.</p>
      <p>The firefighters were able to free the little girl after she became wedged in between the bars of the Cuggl stairgate at her Bristol home.</p>
      <p>Argos has just recalled several models of the baby stairgate, amid warnings the model is faulty and doesn't meet EU safety standards.</p>
      <p>The child, who has not been named, managed to get her leg stuck in the stairgate, with firefighters using their own ‘muscle power’ to bend the bars apart to release her limb.</p>
      <p>The toddler's rescuers added their voice to the calls for parents to check their baby gates and take them back if they are the specific brand, reports the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/firefighters-rescue-girl-2-trapped-3554499">Bristol Post</a>.</p>

      <p>Argos announced last week that they are recalling seven Cuggl stairgates for failing <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/european-union">key EU safety tests</a>, including one which ensures the bars are not too far apart.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for  <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/kingswood">Kingswood</a>  Fire Station said they were called to the house in east Bristol by a parent who couldn’t free their child from the stair gate.</p>
      <p>“We have just rescued a two-year-old child from this stair gate,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We used muscle power to bend the bars apart to release her leg.</p>
      <p>“The parent was on her way to take it back due to a recall for the bars being too far apart,” he said, adding that parents should check their stairgate isn’t on the recalled list.</p>
      <p>Argos sell the Cuggl stair gates and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/popular-stair-gate-brands-fail-2927926"> earlier this year recalled two</a>  for failing key tests for EU safety standards.</p>
      <p>They removed those models from sale at the time, and after an investigation by the consumer magazine Which?, Argos said it had carried out further ‘intensive independent testing’ of its entire Cuggl range.</p>
      <h3>What are the problems?</h3>
      <p>Argos says there is a risk of the following problems occurring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brackets or wooden slats breaking under high impact</li>
        <li>Regular banging or kicking of the gate, for example the auto-close feature failing</li>
        <li>The gaps between metal bars being wider than the required standard, which could lead to a child getting trapped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What products are being recalled?</h3>
      <p>Here’s the full list of affected products:</p>
