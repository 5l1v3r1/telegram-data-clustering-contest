      <p>According to figures in <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/201911/20187303.html">Japanese publication Famitsu</a>, Nintendo's <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-in-progress-pokemon-sword-572679.phtml"><i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i></a> sold a total of 1,364,544 combined physical copies during the first three days of release, including boxed releases, download cards and the special "Dual Pack."<br/><br/>This number just beats out last year's <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's</i> launch, which saw 1.23 million units sold in the same time frame. Of course it should be noted that <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> are two individually listed titles, and thus some players will have picked up both, bolstering the numbers somewhat. Nintendo has also seen a spike in the sales of Switch hardware, with over 180,000 consoles sold in Japan between November 11-17.<br/><br/>In the UK, <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i> both succeeded in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../pokemon-sword-and-shield-has-a-smash-debut-in-the-uk-charts-572822.phtml">debuting in the Top Five</a> of the charts, making it the fastest-selling Switch title to date. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-19-nintendo-switch-uk-sales-spike-30-percent-as-pok-mon-sword-and-shield-sets-record">A similar spike in hardware sales</a> in the UK has shifted some 90,000 Switch units in the last 20 days. Whichever way you choose to look at it, it's a successful start for Game Freak's latest venture into the <i>Pokémon</i> universe.<br/><br/><i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i> are available now on Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/201911/20187303.html">Pokémon Sword and Shield physical launch numbers</a> [Famitsu / <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/pokemon-sword-and-shield-sold-1-36-million-retail-copies-in-first-three-days-in-japan">Gematsu</a> / <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-19-nintendo-switch-uk-sales-spike-30-percent-as-pok-mon-sword-and-shield-sets-record">Gamesindustry</a>]</p>
