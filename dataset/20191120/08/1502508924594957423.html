      <p>A group of European parliamentarians who recently visited Kashmir were on a "private visit" to the country, the government informed Parliament on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The government of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/jammu-and-kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir </a>has reported that a group of 27 members of European Parliament (MEPs), who belonged to different political parties including ruling and opposition parties, paid a private visit to India from October 28, 2019 to November 1, 2019 at the invitation of International Institute for Nonaligned Studies, a Delhi based think tank," Union minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy said in a written statement in Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>He was responding to a set of questions that sought to know which institution organised and bore expenses of this Kashmir tour and whether the institution that organised it was working as a coordinating institution of the central government.</p>
      <p>To another question whether the Union government has "distracted" from its policy of not allowing any external intervention on the Jammu-Kashmir issue, Reddy stated that India's consistent position has been that issues, if any, with Pakistan are discussed only bilaterally.</p>
      <p>"There is no scope for any third party role or mediation," the minister said.</p>
      <p>In the first visit by a foreign delegation, a team of 23 MEPs travelled to Kashmir in October on a two-day visit to have a first-hand assessment of the situation after the state's special status was revoked in August by abrogating <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-article-370">Article 370.</a></p>
      <p>Of the 27 MPs who came to India, 23 went to Kashmir.</p>
