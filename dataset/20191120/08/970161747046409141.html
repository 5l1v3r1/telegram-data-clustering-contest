      <p>A mysterious floating mask has got fans convinced that Sony and Activision are about to announce a brand-new Crash Bandicoot game.</p>
      <p>Given the enormous success of the Crash Bandicoot remakes it’s not even worth questioning whether a new game would be set to follow – it’s just a question of when.</p>
      <p>Between <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review-return-of-the-marsupial-mascot-6743950/">Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/14/spyro-reignited-trilogy-review-phoenix-from-the-flames-8139139/">Spyro Reignited Trilogy</a>, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/25/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review-mario-carted-off-10053901/">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> there’s been a new family friendly game from Activision every year since 2017, so an announcement for something new in 2020 would not be a surprise.</p>
      <p>Whether that’s what’s happening in this new ad for the PlayStation though, is hard to say. But if you slow it down and pay close attention to the Crash Team Racing section you can clearly spot a floating Aku-Aku mask, but one that’s a completely different design to anything previously seen.</p>

      <p>Considering how much trouble the, clearly very expensive, advert goes to in replicating its various games it seems unlikely that anyone would just make up a non-canon mask for no reason.</p>
      <p>Toys for Bob artist Nicholas Kole commented on the theory with a very suspicious-sounding tweet, having previously <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/cvygo4/spyro_artist_nicholas_kole_retweets_leaked_crash/">‘accidentally’ tweeted</a>, and then deleted, an image that seems to show new character art.</p>
      <p>Fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/dw7zu5/dont_know_if_this_has_been_posted_yet_but_i_saw/">Reddit</a> have also noticed that the Crash Bandicoot character model being used in the print versions of the same PlayStation campaign is brand new and not from any of the previous games, with a slight redesign to make it closer to the PlayStation 1 originals.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/dw7zu5/dont_know_if_this_has_been_posted_yet_but_i_saw/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Don’t know if this has been posted yet, but I saw our guy on a bus today. Really took me by surprise!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/">crashbandicoot</a></blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanPS88/status/1196193164358537220">leaker</a> who was proven right about the Crash Bandicoot remakes suggests the new game is called Crash Bandicoot Worlds and actually has three new masks, a semi-open world similar to Super Mario 3D World, and is due to be unveiled in December.</p>
      <p>If that’s true then it almost certainly means a reveal a The Game Awards on 13 December. None of the leaks or rumours comment on whether it’d be a PlayStation exclusive, but by appearing in a Sony ad like this that’s certainly the implication – at least for the first year.</p>
