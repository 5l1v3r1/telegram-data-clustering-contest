          <b>The second trailer for Cats has landed. </b>

      <p>You might remember the intense reaction to the first trailer for <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/trailer-cats-here-everyone-horrified-332819"><i>Cats</i></a> earlier this year - it pretty much left everyone speechless.</p>
      <p>With Idris Elba, Judi Dench, James Corden and many more A-list celebs, it has the makings of a great film, however the famous faces attached to cat bodies is a bit too bonkers for some.</p>
      <p>Tom Hooper, director of the King's Speech and Les Miserables, is the mastermind behind the highly-anticipated film with one of the main questions related to the use of CGI animation.</p>

      <p>You'll recognise some of movie land's most revered names including Sir Ian McKellen but it must be said that seeing them in cat form takes a bit of getting used to.</p>
      <p>There's been a strong reaction to the latest trailer featuring Macavity the Mystery Cat (Idris Elba), Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson) and Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) to name but a few.</p>
      <p>It lands on December 20 and judging by the hype so far, you're going to hear a lot more about this film release over the next few weeks.</p>
