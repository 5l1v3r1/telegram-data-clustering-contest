        <b>Hundreds of thousands of documents on Nazi crimes with information on some 10 million people were made accessible online on Tuesday, the Germany-based International Center on Nazi Prosecution said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The documents are from the American Zone of Occupation in southern Germany<br/>-- the largest Allied-controlled area -- and are part of the centre's trove known as the Arolsen Archives, some of which are already online.</p>
      <p>In the months after the end of the war, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States -- the four occupying powers -- ordered local German authorities to provide information on the fate of any foreign nationals, German Jews and stateless persons.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Details of burial sites were also included.</p>
      <p>"In the American Zone of Occupation alone, this resulted in the creation of<br/>around 850,000 documents containing information on 10 million names," the<br/>centre said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The archive, previously known as the International Tracing Service, has helped researchers discover the history of Nazi victims such as Anne Frank.</p>
      <p>Rebecca BÃ¶hling, acting head of the National Institute for Holocaust Documentation at the United States Holocaust Museum said the archive was of "exceptional significance".</p>
      <p>The Arolsen Archives team said in a statement it had worked with the genealogical research company Ancestry in order to make the information accessible "quickly and easily".</p>
      <p>The centre said it would be putting more lists online soon, starting with . the archive for the British Zone of Occupation.</p>
