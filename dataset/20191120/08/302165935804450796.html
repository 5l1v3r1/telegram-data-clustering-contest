      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 20 — The grand colonial-style building here that used to house the Standard Chartered Bank for over 87 years has been converted into a co-working space called Spaces Beach Street.</p>
      <p>The building, designed by John McNeill and CG Boutcher of Stark &amp; McNeill architects back in 1926, was completed in 1930.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered Bank sold the four-storey building to Mercury Securities Sdn Bhd in the 1990s and had remained as a tenant in the building until they moved to another premise down the road in 2017.</p>
      <p>Mercury Securities managing director Chew Sing Guan said the building is a historical building that fronted Beach Street.</p>
      <p>“Its imposing structure, intimidating wooden doors and beautiful architecture provides a fitting place for a co-working space for businesses to meet and work,” he said at the opening of Spaces Beach Street today.</p>
      <p>He said the iconic building is one that most Penangites remember as it fronted the beginning of Beach Street and is also a popular site for couples to have their pre-wedding photos taken along the corridors of the building.</p>
      <p>The ground floor of the building has remained vacant before International Workplace Group (IWG) took a lease of the space to create Spaces Beach Street.</p>
      <p>The upper floors of the building were divided into many offices and were mostly occupied by legal firms.</p>

      <p>Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow, who attended the official opening of Spaces, said the first ever co-working space by the state government was launched about four years ago at Wisma Yeap Chor Ee, also in the heritage zone.</p>
      <p>He said it was fitting for IWG to open up a co-working space in the heritage zone where Penang started out as a trading port.</p>
      <p>He said the co-working space will be a good platform for entrepreneurs and business owners to meet and work with their peers.</p>
      <p>“It can be a good platform for the people to connect, communicate and expand the business community here,” he said.</p>
      <p>Spaces Beach Street is the second co-working space by IWG in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>IWG Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Country Head T. Vijayakumar said Spaces Beach Street will be a cultural and business hub for businesses of all sizes.</p>
      <p>“Spaces offers a vibrant atmosphere where free-spirited entrepreneurs and digital nomads can share ideas, build connections and be catalysts for change,” he said.</p>
      <p>IWG has a networked of Spaces workspaces in more than 250 locations worldwide.</p>
      <p>It set up its first workspace in Malaysia with the opening of Spaces Platinum Sentral in Kuala Lumpur and Spaces Beach Street is its second workspace in Malaysia.</p>
