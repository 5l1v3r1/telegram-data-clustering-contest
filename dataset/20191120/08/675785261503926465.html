      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham Amazon documentary concerns as Jose Mourinho steps in</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by Tottenham and replaced by Jose Mourinho, with fans now eagerly awaiting the release of their Amazon Prime documentary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:01:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino had admitted his concerns about Tottenham's Amazon Prime documentary before his sacking.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was axed on Tuesday night with Jose Mourinho having now been confirmed as his successor.</p>
      <p>It adds a stunning new storyline to the fly-on-the-wall documentary series, that will adopt a similar format to those at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , Leeds and Sunderland.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen how Mourinho will deal with the cameras on him but Pochettino admitted he was a little uneasy when asked about the programme last month.</p>
      <p>“When the club agreed the deal with Amazon, of course we were worried about it. Because it is not easy, not easy," he said.</p>

      <p>"It is tough to have the camera in your office, and then how you handle the situation to have the capacity to say: ‘OK, I am not in a good mood, but sometimes the camera is going to be there.’ It is so complicated, it is another thing to worry about and of course that adds a lot.</p>
      <p>“If we were busy, now we are super busy. To plan every day, everything, is not an easy job. That is why, when I told you I feel that I am not any more a manager, I am a coach, now I am like a producer. Being coach, manager and producer.”</p>

      <p>Pochettino even suggested there was a 'risk' that came with such programmes if fortunes didn't improve on the pitch - as they haven't.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be the reality. It is like when we started to do the book [Inside Pochettino’s Spurs] one season. It was the same risk.</p>
      <p>"The most important is to live the reality, not to try to generate something that is fake or not real.</p>
      <p>"And then what you are going to love, what the people are going to love to see, is that we are normal people working. We can win, we can lose.</p>
      <p>“Like the book, I hope there is a happy ending. But if not, you are going to see another point of view, from a different vision.”</p>
