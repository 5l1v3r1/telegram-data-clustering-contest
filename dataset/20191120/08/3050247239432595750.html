      <h1>China Digital Currency Launch 'Definitely’ in 6-12 Months — Investor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:13:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a> will “definitely” deploy its new <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/digital-currency">digital currency</a> within the next six months to a year, a local <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> investor has said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/20/chinas-virtual-currency-may-be-rolled-out-within-a-year-edith-yeung.html">CNBC</a> on Nov. 20, Edith Cheung, partner at blockchain-focused venture capital fund Proof of Capital, appeared convinced about the digital currency’s imminent arrival.</p>
      <h3>Cheung: rollout could come in May 2020</h3>
      <p>“I think definitely within the next six to twelve months,” she told the network about a launch time frame. </p>
      <p>China has revealed it has been developing the virtual yuan for several years, but senior government officials have so far <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-central-bank-digital-currency-has-no-timetable-for-launch">declined</a> to state when it could become a reality. </p>
      <p>For Cheung, however, foreign powers should already be prepared to respond, as China looks to become the first country worldwide to issue a digital incarnation of its national currency. </p>
      <p>“I really think the United States needs to hurry up; to have a strong thinking and policy, at least a direction for virtual USD,” she continued.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, another investor delivered a more bullish forecast for the digital currency rollout, claiming it would appear in just <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hcm-capital-expects-chinas-digital-currency-to-launch-in-2-3-months">three months’ time</a>.</p>
      <h3>Blockchain expectation versus reality</h3>
      <p>China remains in the spotlight as the digital currency plans run in tandem with the official endorsement of blockchain technology. <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-walks-back-hardline-media-rhetoric-toward-crypto-and-blockchain">Announced</a> by President Xi Jinping last month, the policy is still having a knock-on effect for Chinese blockchain projects, several of which have seen the value of their own cryptocurrency tokens rise considerably.</p>
      <p>At the same time, Chinese state media more recently poured cold water on current levels of commitment to blockchain. </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-state-media-says-most-blockchain-firms-in-china-are-all-hype-no-code">new statistics</a>, only around 10% of the 32,000 businesses in China which claim to use the technology actually do.</p>
