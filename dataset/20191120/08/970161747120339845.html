      <p>You know how revenge is a dish best served cold?! Well, for Martin Kemp it’s a dish best served with a side order of fish eyes and kangaroo testicles.</p>
      <p>The Spandau Ballet star proudly declared he’s nominated son Roman for the latest I’m a Celebrity Bushtucker Trial to allow the radio DJ to put his money where his mouth is.</p>
      <p>Roman may have well and truly put his foot in it with dear old Pops after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/martin-kemp-gets-revenge-son-roman-singing-comments-voting-im-celebrity-bushtucker-trials-11186146/v">mocking his singing ability</a> on Monday night’s show.</p>
      <p>So when it came time to vote…</p>
      <p>Sensing the prime opportunity for payback, Martin wrote on Twitter: ‘Just voted for my boy to eat Kangaroo B****ks .. That’ll show him!!’</p>
      <p>Turns out Martin’s cheeky little ploy worked out – and now Roman is joining forces with Adele Roberts for his first ever trial – aptly called Just Desserts.</p>

      <p>After previously bragging he would eat anything put in front of him, it’s time for Roman to prove he’s not all bark and no bite (…literally).</p>
      <p>The star has been proudly talking about his family heritage which includes his 80s legend parents Martin (who performed in Spandau Ballet) and Shirlie (a backing singer for Wham!), and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-roman-kemp-reveals-george-michael-gatecrashed-dad-martins-first-date-mum-shirlie-11180122/">his godfather George Michael.</a></p>

      <p>But during a chat he joked that 58-year-old Martin ‘couldn’t even sing or play an instrument’ when Spandau Ballet was formed.</p>
      <p>Roman laughed: ‘He still can’t. He still hasn’t realised his mic wasn’t on for Live Aid!’</p>
      <p>But he also praised Martin, who also appeared on EastEnders, as his ‘hero’ after fighting through a brain tumour and rebuilding himself from scratch.</p>
      <p>‘How can my dad not be my hero through all of that. We’re a proper unit,’ he added.</p>
