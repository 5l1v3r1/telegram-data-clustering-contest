      <p>The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Adams Oshiomhole claims the Senators who left the party have been punished by not winning re-election.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that about 16 Senators with a former Senate President Bukola Saraki left the party prior to the 2019 elections.</p>
      <p>Speaking with State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, Osimhole claimed that Nigerians have decided to punish the decamped politicians.</p>
      <p>“But of course, we also know that there was an election in Kogi but that is a matter for another day when we present the governor re-elected,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But we do realize that all the 16 senators who decamped along with Senator Bukola Saraki from APC to PDP, hard as they have tried to come back, the Nigerian people in their respective constituencies, have insisted on punishing them for being disloyal and refusing to monetize their mandates.</p>
      <p>“I think the only one that is still struggling now is Dino Melaye but as you can see from the result so car, Senator Smart Adeyemi is leading by over 20,000 votes even though INEC insists we must have a re-run for the remaining areas, we are confident that there is no way he can make up for 20,000 vote deficit.</p>
      <p>“I think the lesson for us to be learnt as a party is rather clear, that when politicians go to the polls to collect mandate on a particular political platform and then they dumped the party for another party, the electorate will always be waiting for them.</p>
      <p>“Over time, we are likely to see people out of fear for the electorate, not monetizing their mandate after they are elected.</p>
      <p>“But overall, we are grateful to Almighty God for making this election successful, we appreciate the people of Bayelsa State who have reposed confidence in our party and on our candidate.”</p>
