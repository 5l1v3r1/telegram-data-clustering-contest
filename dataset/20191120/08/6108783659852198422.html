      <h3>Get excited, PC players.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/halo-combat-evolved/"><i>Halo Combat Evolved</i></a> PC testing will be made avaliable to <i>Halo </i>insiders sometime after the 2019 holiday season, 343 Industries has confirmed.</p>
      <p>343’s Brian Jarrard made the confirmation to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection/halo-ce-pc">PCgamesN</a> recently, saying, “We’re taking a game that’s very old, and we’re trying to update it for this platform – making it run at 60 fps, 4K – but also trying to account for all the requirements that PC gamers expect nowadays.”</p>
      <p>The version of <i>Halo: Combat Evolved </i>in question is the Anniversary edition first released to Xbox 360, later added to <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection </i>on Xbox One. The PC testing will of course be used to add <i>Halo: Combat Evolved </i>to <i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection </i>on Windows PC.</p>
      <p>Jarrard confirmed this new version of <i>Halo</i> on PC — the original game is already available on PC — will support “uncapped frame rates, an FOV slider, and support for different aspect ratios.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/halo-the-master-chief-collection/"><i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</i></a> is available on Xbox One now; <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/halo-reach-master-chief-collection-release-date-set-3-december/"><i>Halo: Reach </i>will kick off the bundle on Windows PC via the Microsoft Store and Steam from 3 December</a>.</p>
