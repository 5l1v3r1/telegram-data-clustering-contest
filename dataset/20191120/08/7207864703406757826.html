      <h2>A game-changer?</h2>

      <p><b>Key point: </b>These designs are novel takes on more classic submarine designs, providing unique capabilities to the Chinese navy.</p>
      <p>The Chinese navy may be putting a new spin on a classic warship: It’s looking into the possibility of giving missile-laden arsenal ships submersible properties, enabling them to hide stockpiles of missiles, undetectable to radar, below the ocean surface.</p>
      <p>The Chinese are exploring two arsenal-ship versions, according to <a href="http://www.popsci.com/futuristic-chinese-warship-concept-is-making-waves#page-5">Popular Science</a>: One is a high-speed surface warship that can submerge at will, while the second is more similar to a traditional submarine.</p>
      <p>What could a submersible surface ship do that a conventional submarine can’t? It could go <i>really</i> fast on the surface, thanks to a hydroplaning hull, Popular Science reports:</p>
      <p>
        <i>For stealth operations, the arsenal ship would have most of its hull inherently submerged, with only the bridge and a few other parts of the ship above the waterline, reducing the radar cross section. But when traveling with a high-speed naval taskforce, the arsenal ship will sacrifice stealth to use its flat hull bottom to hydroplane at high speeds, cutting across the waves like a speedboat or amphibious armored vehicle.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The alternative plan calls for a platform that behaves similar to World War II submarines, Popular Science writes — typically staying at the surface, but able to completely submerge for stealth.</p>
      <p>Two Chinese universities are responsible for the designing the concepts, according to <a href="http://www.whst.gov.cn/xwzx/show/31732.aspx">the Wuhan city government</a>. Those institutions, the Wuhan University of Science and Technology and Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Naval University of Engineering, were awarded a <a href="https://defence.pk/pdf/threads/china-unveils-a-new-concept-of-naval-warships-semi-submersible-arsenal-ship.498164/">state prize for the work</a>.</p>
      <p>The concepts have been in the works since 2011, but anticipation is building. According to Popular Science, the diving missile ship’s “proof-of-concept is under construction at Bohai Shipbuilding Heavy Industrial Corporation, to be launched after 2020.”</p>
