      <h1>New Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho gushes over Spurs transfer target Bruno Fernandes</h1>
      <h2>Bruno Fernandes was a transfer target for Tottenham and Manchester United over the summer but remained at Sporting Lisbon - and Jose Mourinho is a big fan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:10:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>New Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is a huge fan of Bruno Fernandes - who was strongly linked with a move to Spurs over the summer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> appeared to be in a straight fight with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> for the services of Fernandes - but he remained at Sporting where he established himself as one of Europe's hottest properties.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese international plundered 31 goals from midfield in just 52 appearances last term and already has eight strikes in 14 games this season.</p>
      <p>He is set to be the subject of yet more interest when the transfer window re-opens in January - and Mourinho has spoken of his admiration for the 25-year-old.</p>

      <p>“I was surprised by the season of Bruno Fernandes," he told Eleven Sports in the summer.</p>
      <p>“It was easy to predict quality, he is a very good player, but scored a very high number of goals for a midfield player.</p>

      <p>“It shows that you need to have instinct and qualities to score and he has it all.</p>
      <p>“He strikes the ball well, heads well, cool when he is one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He finds space in the penalty area. It’s all there.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal in north London after Spurs sacked Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It is his first managerial role since being sacked by Manchester United last December.</p>
