        <li>The historic match will kickstart with Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball</li>

      <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday gave a sneak peak of the preparations that have been made for India's first day-night Test match which will be played against Bangladesh at the iconic Eden Gardens stadium from Friday.</p>
      <p>Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) is leaving no stone unturned to make the Test match a special one for Indian and Bangladeshi fans, who will be coming to witness the match from November 22.</p>
      <p>BCCI released a 17-second clip on social media in which the Eden Gardens can be seen lit up in the pink colour, inside and out.</p>
      <p>"Kolkata gearing up for the #PinkBallTest," BCCI captioned the post. India currently lead the two-match series after beating Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs in the first Test at Indore.</p>

      <p>Fans are also playing their part in turning the match into a special occasion by grabbing all the available tickets for the first four days, as confirmed by BCCI president Sourav Ganguly on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The historic match will kickstart with Army paratroopers flying into the Eden Gardens to hand over a pink ball each to the two captains just before the toss.</p>
      <p>This will be followed by the ringing of the customary Eden Bell by Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee.</p>
      <p>Then at the 20-minute tea break, former captains and the galaxy of sport stars from other disciplines will be taken out on carts making a round of the ground along the boundary lines.</p>
      <p>During the 40-minute supper break, CAB has organised a talk show featuring the 'Fabulous Five' of Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman who will walk down the memory lane, delving on the epic 2001 Test win against Australia here.</p>
      <p>The CAB will also felicitate a galaxy of Indian sports stars including Tendulkar, Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra, tennis star Sania Mirza, world badminton champion PV Sindhu and six-time boxing world champion MC Mary Kom among others.</p>
      <p>Specially designed mementos will be given to the dignitaries while they will also make round of the stadium aboard golf carts, CAB secretary Avishek Dalmiya said.</p>
      <p>The CAB will also felicitate the team members of Bangladesh-India first-ever Test in 2000, a game where Ganguly made his debut as Test captain.</p>
