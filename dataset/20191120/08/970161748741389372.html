      <p>Camila Cabello has admitted she’s had feelings for her boyfriend <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/shawn-mendes/">Shawn Mendes</a> since 2015, despite only <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> him since earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Oh, you guys.</p>
      <p>The Havana hitmaker, who was pictured looking chill in gym gear and giving cameras a cheeky pose as she arrived at her vocal coach studio, explained that she ‘bonded with him’ when they collaborated on their track I Know What You Did Last Summer.</p>
      <p>‘During I Know What You Did Last Summer I really bonded with him as more than a friend,’ the 22-year-old said. ‘I think he did, too, but we were both really young, and he was experiencing the pressures of his career.’</p>

      <p>She <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/camila-cabello-interview-romance-shawn-mendes-912838/">added to Rolling Stone</a>: ‘I don’t think we knew what to do with those feelings. It was this awkward thing where we both liked each other, but we weren’t together. It was just weird.’</p>

      <p>Fast-forward to 2019, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/07/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-drifted-apart-senorita-nearly-didnt-make-song-10702388/">when they reunited for their hit Senorita</a>, and apparently all the feels came flooding back.</p>
      <p>‘Our paths just didn’t cross in that way romantically until we started hanging out again and writing. For me, it just brought it back,’ Camila said.</p>
      <p>The star also melted everyone’s hearts by saying that her Canadian beau feels like home to her.</p>
      <p>Camila and Shawn have only been dating since July 2019, but it seems that things are moving pretty quickly between the pair,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/shawn-mendes-camila-cabellos-idea-day-date-getting-tattoos-together-11123423/"> with them getting tattoos together.</a></p>
      <p>Both chose to get a new design etched onto their body, with Camila choosing a quote from Shakespeare In Love along the inside of her little finger and boyfriend Shawn opting for the letter A behind his ear.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, they’re no strangers to a spot of the ol’ PDA, with one of their most recent dates <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/camila-cabello-and-shawn-mendes-cant-keep-their-hands-or-their-lips-to-themselves-on-courtside-date-11083242/">seeing them all over each other at a basketball game.</a></p>
      <p>They were papped snuggling up, holding hands and kissing while sitting in the audience at the big game.</p>

      <p>And it seems we can always <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/shawn-mendes-shares-insight-camila-cabello-dates-pretty-specific-detail-10876840/">count on them for cracking date ideas.</a></p>
      <p>In a recent Q&amp;A in Kuala Lumpur, Shawn said: ‘Camila and I will basically wake up and find the nearest coffee we can find.’</p>

      <p>Then he went on to describe how they will find plenty of food, have random conversations and perhaps wind up watching Tangled.</p>
      <p>Hey, at least they’ve got good taste in movies.</p>
