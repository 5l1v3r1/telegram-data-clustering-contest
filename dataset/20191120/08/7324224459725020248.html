      <p>Their lead at the top, however, was trimmed to four points because the team which ended their run, Amblecote RBL A, stormed to a 5-0 win at home to Amblecote Institute E, Ryan Willetts winning on his first appearance, and Billy Green making it 9/10 although he was hard-pressed by Audie Homer.</p>
      <p>Old Edwardians B are now five points further back in 3rd place, after suffering a 3-2 defeat away to Kinver Constitutional D. Only Sam and Brett Ball could win as Dan Barker, John Cumiskey and Joe Smith took the match for Kinver.</p>
      <p>Veteran Harry Jones and newcomer Lee Ward gave Stourbridge Institute B a great start at 4th placed Wombourne, but the home team hit back through Bob Mason’s respotted black against Kevin Hulme, Dave Flavell, who’s lost only once, and Paul Tristram, in the decider against Carl Green.</p>
      <p>Successive defeats had caused Amblecote RBL B’s challenge to falter, but they returned to winning ways, 3-2 away to Bahia’s SC B. Steve Bull, Mark Lees and Richard Conway won for them with Ben Jones and Mark Reece taking some consolation for Bahia’s.</p>
