      <p>Harry Kane has paid a special tribute to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> after the Argentine was sacked by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Less than six months after guiding the team to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final, Pochettino has been axed by Spurs following extensive talks with the club’s chairman Daniel Levy over the past week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoint-jose-mourinho-new-manager-replacing-mauricio-pochettino-11185760/">Jose Mourinho has now replaced Pochettino as manager and has signed a three-and-a-half year deal with Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>Kane, meanwhile, has played a key role at Spurs since Pochettino took over in 2014 and has thanked the Argentine for his support during their time together.</p>
      <p>‘Gaffer. I’ll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams,’ said Kane.</p>
