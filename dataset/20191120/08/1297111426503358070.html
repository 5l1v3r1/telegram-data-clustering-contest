      <h1>Ex-Pat Sergei Alkhimov nets another win over his former club</h1>
      <h2>Isaac Poulter and Sergei Alkhimov led the Swift Current Broncos to a 2-1 win over the Regina Pats on Tuesday night at the Brandt Centre.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:04:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>The third team is the charm for Sergei Alkhimov.</p>
      <p>After being traded twice in a span of 4 ½ months, Alkhimov appears to have found a home with the Swift Current Broncos, who hung on for a 2-1 win over the Regina Pats on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Russian forward set up Ethan Regnier for the game’s first goal and added the eventual game-winner in the third period. It was Alkhimov’s second victory of the season over his former team after <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-play-their-best-game-of-the-year-in-tight-loss-to-vancouver-giants">helping the Vancouver Giants beat Regina 4-2 on Oct. 12</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy to be here again; I like the fans, I like the rink,” Alkhimov said as 3,902 fans headed for the exits at the Brandt Centre. “I had two games, two wins. It feels good that I can help this team.”</p>
      <p>It has been an interesting year for Alkhimov, who <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/russian-wrecking-ball-finds-a-home-in-regina">spent his rookie season with the Pats</a> after being selected in the 2018 CHL import draft. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats-trade-sergei-alkhimov-to-vancouver-giants-for-dawson-holt">Regina traded him in the off-season to Vancouver</a>, where the 18-year-old forward recorded just one assist in 16 games.</p>
      <p>The Giants flipped Alkhimov to Swift Current two weeks ago and he hasn’t looked back, notching two goals and two assists in just three games.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to explain (what it has been like),” said Alkhimov, who made it clear that he never wanted to leave the Pats. “It was surprising (to be dealt twice in the same year). I really didn’t like the trade from Regina to Vancouver but it’s life and I can’t control it. Right now I feel like I’m in a place where I need to be. I’m really excited to be here.”</p>
      <p>The Broncos are glad to have him.</p>
      <p>“He has been real good,” said head coach/GM Dean Brockman, who praised Alkhimov’s attitude and work ethic. “He comes to the rink and he wants to do more and more every day. You have to kick him off the ice. He’s just a guy that’s really positive in all situations and kind of a leader. He obviously wants to win games and he wants to be a better player.”</p>
      <p>It showed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Alkhimov supplied most of the Broncos’ offence in a second-star effort while goaltender Isaac Poulter picked up first-star honours, stopping 48 of 49 shots.</p>
      <p>Afterward, the Pats could only tip their cap to the opposing goaltender.</p>
      <p>“That’s what you do,” said head coach Dave Struch, whose club outshot Swift Current 49-28. “We threw everything we had at the net and Poulter was really good. It’s not the first time he has done it to us.”</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s contest was an unsightly affair between two teams that reside at or near the bottom of the WHL standings.</p>
      <p>The Pats (3-13-2-0) came out with some jump but squandered a handful of early chances versus Swift Current (5-11-1-2), including a 2-on-0 breakaway. The visitors eventually opened the scoring midway through the first period when Alkhimov’s wraparound attempt slid across the crease to Regnier, who knocked it into the open side.</p>
      <p>Zack Smith tied it 4:10 into the second, redirecting a point shot from Nikita Sedov.</p>
      <p>Alkhimov broke the stalemate 8:21 into the third when he grabbed a loose puck near the top of the right circle, spun around and let it go from long distance, finding some daylight between the pads of goalie Max Paddock.</p>
      <p>Poulter took care of the rest.</p>
      <p>“In the first two periods we were there (with Regina),” Brockman said. “But in the third period we were just kind of hanging on for dear life and our goaltender was really good.”</p>
      <p>The Pats outshot Swift Current 23-3 in the third and had three of their six power-play chances, one of which came in the last two minutes of regulation.</p>
      <p>Paddock was pulled for an extra attacker to make it 6-on-4, but to no avail.</p>
      <p>“These are the growing pains that you go through,” said Struch, whose team is in the second year of a wholesale rebuild. “You just have to stick with it. If you weren’t getting opportunities and you weren’t outworking the opposition, then you’d have question marks. But we outworked them tonight. We outchanced them for sure. We outshot them. We outfaceoffed them (40-25). There’s a lot of things you could put a check mark in the box. Their goalie played very well for them.”</p>
      <p><b>EXTRAS</b>: The Pats were without F Carter Massier, who’s day-to-day with a knee injury that’s not as serious as originally feared. D Tyson Feist and F Riley Krane were healthy scratches … Following Wednesday’s game against the Calgary Hitmen, the Pats have seven straight on the road.</p>
