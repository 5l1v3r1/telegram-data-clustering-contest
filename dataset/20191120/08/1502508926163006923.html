Analysts at KR Choksey expect Sun Pharma’s topline/bottom-line to grow by CAGR 12.3 per cent/18.6 per cent over the period FY19 to FY21 on back of specialty revenue and with launch of Cequa (launched in Oct2019) while EBITDA margin is forecast to further expand in near term with traction seen in Ilumya.
