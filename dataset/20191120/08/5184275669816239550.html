      <p>Turned out that the people from Kota were not quite happy with the reference to their city as it bought bad gaze and featured their state in a negative light. After they raised their concerns regarding the same, the makers have now decided to tweak the trailer remove the references to the state according to a report in Bollywood Hungama.</p>
      <p>While the trailer said the film is based on real-life events in Kota, the production house Yash Raj Films has decided to remove the real-life events claims from the film. The decision is to remove all the possible misinterpretation.</p>
      <p>Talking about the storyline, Rani is stepping back into her cop avatar for the second instalment directed by Gopi Puthran. The film is all set to release on December 13.</p>
