      <p>The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has sent an advisory to all States and Union Territories asking them to strictly enforce the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/why-has-india-banned-e-cigarettes/article29478965.ece">ban on e-cigarettes </a>cleared by the Union Cabinet in September.</p>
      <p>The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (production, import, export, distribution, storage and advertisement) Ordinance was promulgated on September 18.</p>
      <p>In a letter to Chief Secretaries and Directors General of Police of all States, the MHA said that the ordinance empowered police officers above the rank of sub-inspectors to “enter, search and seize” prohibited items without any warrant.</p>
      <p>“It is requested that due enforcement of provisions of the ordinance may kindly be ensured, considering the deleterious impact of e-cigarette on public health, especially in respect of young population going to schools and colleges,” the advisory said.</p>
      <p>It also asked States to sensitise the enforcement personnel for effective implementation of the ordinance.</p>
