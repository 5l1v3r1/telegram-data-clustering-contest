      <h4>Here are five experiences you can’t miss on an Indian vacation.</h4>
      <p>Are you ready for an Indian adventure? A vast and diverse country, India has been steadily <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/206889/number-of-foreign-tourist-arrivals-in-india-by-month/">attracting more foreign tourists</a> to its shores in the past decade. With its mix of tradition, festivals, architecture and contrasting landscapes, it’s not hard to see why.</p>
      <p>In the north, there’s the snow-tipped peaks of the Himalaya, while a little further down is the iconic Taj Mahal. Moving through central India you’ll encounter precious wildlife before hitting the relaxed backwaters of Kerala in the south. </p>
      <p>And of course, there’s so much more in-between. Here are five experiences you can’t miss on an <a href="https://www.audleytravel.com/us/india">Indian vacation</a>. </p>
      <p><b>Practice spirituality in the Himalayas</b><br/>The Himalaya mountain range is well-known for its spiritual energy and connection to the Hindu goddess Parvati. Amongst its peaks is the famous Ananda Spa, where guests can learn more about the ancient practice of yoga.</p>
      <p>Take part in a personal yoga and meditation programme and leave feeling reconnected and recharged thanks to the guidance of the spa’s magical therapists. </p>
      <p><b>Take a game drive in Rajasthan</b><br/>The state of Rajasthan is home to the Ranthambhore National Park. This vast wildlife reserve is home to endangered Bengal tigers among other precious animals including elephants, leopards, camels and birds.</p>
      <p>Set off on a private game drive to see what you can spot and share this unique experience with those you love.   </p>
      <p><b>Explore the ruins of Hampi</b>    <br/>Once the capital of an ancient Indian empire before its destruction in the mid-16th century, today the ancient village of Hampi is home to several well-preserved ruined temple complexes that tell the incredible story of the area’s history. </p>
      <p>Rent a bike and explore this UNESCO World Heritage Site at your own pace. </p>
      <p><b>Float atop the river Ganges</b>    <br/>Running down from the Himalayas before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, the Ganges is a sacred river which passes through several holy Indian cities. It’s home to countless diverse cultural traditions and represents many different things to many different people. </p>
      <p>Rent a boat early in the morning to see bathers deep in prayer, or descend at dusk to watch the communal worship that takes place on its shores every evening.  </p>
      <p><b>Get stuck in at the Holi festival</b><br/>India is a religiously diverse country and plays host to several intense religious festivals. Among the most celebrated are Diwali and Holi, the second of which involves throwing colored powders and water to paint the streets and its people in all colours of the rainbow.</p>
      <p>No-one escapes the vibrant transformation, so prepare to get caught in the crossfire. If you’re desperate to experience Holi yourself it’s worth booking ahead as hotels fill up quickly. </p>
      <p>Have you booked your trip yet? Squeeze these experiences into your itinerary and have a holiday to remember for years to come.</p>
