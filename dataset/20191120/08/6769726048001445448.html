      <h1>Weekend road closure for flyover not affecting emergency vehicles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:15:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Jarvis</a></address>
      <p>EMERGENCY vehicles will have access through the Wanneroo Road-Joondalup Drive intersection during this weekend’s closure, which will see installation of the flyover bridge beams.</p>
      <p>Main Roads plans to <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/wanneroo-times/news/main-roads-plans-weekend-closure-for-wanneroo-road-joondalup-drive-flyover-works/">close the intersection</a> after 8pm on Friday, November 22 until 5am on Monday, November 25 so work crews can safely install 16 bridge beams, which weigh 120 tonnes.</p>
      <p>There will be detours in place, diverting motorists towards Neerabup Road, Flynn Drive and Pinjar Road.</p>
      <p>Main Roads spokesman Dean Roberts said the project team had liaised with Department of Fire Emergency Services while planning the closure and access requirements, including for Joondalup Fire and Rescue at the stations on Drovers Place.</p>
      <p>“We will have a radio channel to or from our traffic controllers operating 24/7 during the closure,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Any emergency service vehicle requiring access through the works area will be let through.”</p>

      <p>DFES north coastal metropolitan operations Superintendent Andrew Hinton said those measures meant the closure would not affect crews called out to incidents.</p>
      <p>He said motorists should slow down and move over, clearing the way for emergency vehicles with they had blue or red flashing lights or were sounding an alarm.</p>
      <p>“When an emergency vehicle is approaching stay calm and check to see where it is; give way to it by moving as far to the left of the road as possible,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you can’t move left, slow down, indicate left and let the emergency vehicle drive around you; use your indicator to signal your intentions to the driver of the emergency vehicle.</p>
      <p>“If you are in the left lane, allow other vehicles from an adjacent lane to move into your lane if required.”</p>

      <p>A St John Ambulance spokeswoman said the agency also worked with Main Roads and other services if there was a planned disruption that affected access to Joondalup Health Campus and put in place contingency plans.</p>
      <p>“St John often encounters road works and we issue notices to crews via our state operations centre with alternative routes,” she said.</p>
      <p>“In this instance we do not envisage any access issues or delays due to the road works in Joondalup.</p>
      <p>“We would remind people to slow down and keep left or move to the left lane if they see an emergency vehicle in their vicinity travelling with lights and sirens turned on.”</p>

      <p>The right turn from Joondalup Drive into Drovers Place will be re-opened for the weekend while the roundabout is closed to allow people to access the Drovers business precinct, and there will be access to the shops for motorists travelling north on Wanneroo Road.</p>
      <p>The lefthand turn from Joondalup Drive into St Stephens Crescent will remain open, but vehicles will not be able to turn left onto Joondalup Drive.</p>
      <p>Main Roads has advised people heading east or west to use Ocean Reef Road or Neerabup Drive, and those heading north or south to use Mitchell Freeway or Pinjar Road for the weekend.</p>

      <p>Pedestrians and cyclists will still have access through the intersection via the current detoured paths, and several bus routes will detour around the closed intersection.</p>
      <p>Contractors are expected to work 24/7 during the closure, using cranes to install four beams for each span, which will be 28m to 33m long and 5m wide.</p>
      <p>Main Roads expects traffic will be able to use the interchange bridge by April, with the $50 million project due to finish in mid-2020.</p>
