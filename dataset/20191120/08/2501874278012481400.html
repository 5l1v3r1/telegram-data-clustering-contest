      <p>When I was a youngin, every year just before Christmas, my Aunt Helen would show up and she always bought plenty of toys, candy, cookies and other treats for us kids. I still remember the Bump and Go trains she bought me seemed like every year I'd get one of those and her gifts were always my favorites. She also bought Tonka trucks, Train sets, Racecar sets Match Box and Hot Wheels cars with the track. I could not wait for her to arrive she'd pull up in her old black Studebaker. It was like seeing Santa's sleigh in the snow, she would come in the front door with bags full of wrapped gifts and treats for everyone. </p>
      <p>Aunt Helen was the best thing about the Holidays, and GrandMa Bommy's cooking. Aunt Helen was my father's sister. She lived in East Chicago, Indiana by herself in the house she was bought up in, she never married but had a lot of friends and of course family though most of her Brothers died young. She would still show up every year without fail for her Nieces and Nephews and there were a lot of us: Four in our family, and my Uncle Ernie who passed away right after my Dad, had 13 kids, 3 girls and 10 boys, Uncle Emery had 2 girls but they were older than the rest of us. One year she bought me a sled and I had a great time sledding down the Calumet overpass. We did not have any mountains in North West Indiana just the hills next to the Off-Ramps and On-Ramps next to the freeway though they were a little steep us kids would spend hours sledding down them on the way home we'd always stop off for hot chocolate with whipped cream on top. One of the things I miss about back home is the snow and the cold though I doubt I could handle that cold without a heater. I don't miss the ice so much as it's easier to slip and fall. I may not have much in this life but I still have my memories of the Old Days and they were the best Days. Everyone should have an Aunt Helen in their family. I'm forever Grateful for ours and all the other Good Folks I have had in my life...HERE IS YOUR SCANNER REPORTS.</p>
