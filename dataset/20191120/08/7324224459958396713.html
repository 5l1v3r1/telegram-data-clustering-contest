      <h1>Ian Harley: Consistency is the key for high-flying Wolves</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton forwards coach Ian Harley has challenged his side to stay consistent in the battle for promotion.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:51:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The Midlands 2 West (North) side sit second in the league after defeating top four rivals Leek and Stafford in their last two games.</p>
      <p>A try from Alex Bird and a conversion and penalty from Liam Holder were enough for Wolverhampton to battle back from 7-0 down to win 10-7 away at Leek.</p>
      <p>“We looked at the fixture list and thought Leek and Stafford would be the two teams to beat,” Harley said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve beat the other three teams in the top four now, two of them away, so we’re very pleased and very proud.</p>
      <p>“Leek were probably the best defensive team I’ve seen at this level.</p>
      <p>“Neither side had a sniff for most of the game, with 90 per cent of it being played between the two 22s.</p>
      <p>“We expect it from teams at the top, it wasn’t going to be a high-scoring game.</p>
      <p>“It was a case of who was going to blink first and take a chance.</p>
      <p>“There were no wild celebrations at the end, which really pleased us as coaches, it shows maturity.</p>
      <p>“There’s an enjoyment and determination about this group.</p>
      <p>“The lads in the pack really stood up too – it’s not a small group, but not a big one either.</p>
      <p>“Their average age is around 24 and they’re really standing up to the physical battles.</p>
      <p>“Our line-out has massively improved too.”</p>
      <p>Harley’s side now sit second in the division, equal on points with leaders Camp Hill and third-placed Leek.</p>
      <p>But Wolverhampton hold a game in hand over their rivals and Harley has warned his team not to be complacent when they face struggling Tamworth on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“The message is clear, there’s no point in beating the teams at the top and not beating the teams at the bottom of the table,” he added.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same attitude that the lads have – Tamworth aren’t suddenly a bad team.</p>
      <p>“We never came out and said that we were going for promotion, we said that we were targetting a win in every game.</p>
      <p>“If you do that, you win promotion.</p>
      <p>“It’s an unsaid message really, that’s what we’re aiming for in every game.</p>
      <p>“Go out and enjoy some rugby and get some tries on the board.”</p>
