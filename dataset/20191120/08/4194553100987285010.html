      <h1>(Video) Wijnaldumâ€™s anti-racism celebration in Holland hat-trick really was top notch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:11:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Gini Wijnaldum is a brilliant footballer and clearly a fantastic person, too.</p>
      <p>In the buildup to Netherlandsâ€™ match against Estonia last night, <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/18/furious-gini-wijnaldum-sends-strong-message-to-authorities-following-racism-in-dutch-second-division/">he spoke at length about racism in football</a> and how it must be eradicated.</p>
      <p>Then while skippering his country in the game, he scored a hat-trick and celebrated with Frenkie de Jong by displaying a clear anti-racism message.</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s taking the captainâ€™s responsibility and using it for good.</p>
      <p>Weâ€™re proud of our midfielder and now canâ€™t wait to welcome him back to Anfield.</p>
      <blockquote>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Wijnaldum is captaining the Holland side tonight. He scored a goal then brought in Frenkie de Jong to celebrate with him as a message for anti-racism. This is powerful. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SayNoToRacism?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SayNoToRacism</a> <a href="https://t.co/PLqxnQAKZW">pic.twitter.com/PLqxnQAKZW<br/></a>â€” FutbolBible (@FutbolBible) <a href="https://twitter.com/FutbolBible/status/1196882292993601541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2019</a></blockquote>
