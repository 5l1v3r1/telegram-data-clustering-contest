        <b>Netflix has announced that a spin-off show of the hit series <i>Vikings</i> will be filmed in Co Wicklow.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The streaming company and MGM Television are producing <i>Vikings: Valhalla</i>, with production to take place in Ashford Studios.</p>
      <p>The show will be set 100 years after the conclusion of the original series, and will 'dramatise the adventures' of famous vikings Leif Erickon, Freydis and Harald Hardrada.</p>
      <p>Series creator Michael Hirst said he's "so happy" to be returning to Ireland.</p>
      <p>He said: "Our Irish crew, in my opinion, is the best and most professional crew in the world.</p>
      <blockquote>"And it has been a particular joy to me, shared with my producer Morgan O’Sullivan, that we have been able to give continuous employment to many hundreds of Irish men and women."</blockquote>
      <p>He added: "Ireland is well known for its support of writers and drama and <i>Vikings</i> has benefitted, and will now continue to benefit, from both that cultural and financial support.</p>
      <p>"Making a great show isn’t a mechanical activity; it’s a human one!”</p>
      <p>Netflix says it has a number of other Irish productions underway - including <i>My Father's Dragon</i> from Kilkenny-based Cartoon Saloon.</p>
