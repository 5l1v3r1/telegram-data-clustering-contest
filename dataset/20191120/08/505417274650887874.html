        <b>Dave Rennie has been confirmed as the new head coach of Australia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The current Glasgow Warriors head coach will finish up at Scotstoun at the end of the current season before he takes up his new role which has been left vacant since Michael Cheika stepped down after the 2019 Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Dave Rennie said: “We’ve loved our time here around great people. It’s been as good as I could have wished for after leaving New Zealand.</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s an exciting opportunity to coach at international level and an added bonus that we’ll be a little closer to home, near our kids and grandkids.</blockquote>
      <p>“All my focus is on the rest of the season in Glasgow as we strive to be in the mix come play-off time in both comps again.”</p>

      <p>Rugby Australia Chief Executive, Raelene Castle said: “This is a massive coup for Australian Rugby, Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we’re thrilled to have secured his services.”</p>
      <p>“Dave’s coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. He has a proven track record in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere.”</p>
