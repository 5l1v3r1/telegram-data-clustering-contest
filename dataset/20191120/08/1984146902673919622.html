      <h2>Dorothy Cox, from Wallsend, crashed her car after taking a friend home following drinks in Newcastle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Nichol</a></address>
      <p>A suspected drink-driving pensioner who was arrested after crashing her car later failed to give police a proper specimen of breath.</p>
      <p>Dorothy Cox had given her friend a lift home following an evening out when she hit a curb in an area of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/wallsend">Wallsend</a>.</p>
      <p>The police were called and the 75-year-old failed a roadside breath test, giving a reading of 73 microgrammes of alcohol in 100ml of breath when the legal limit is 35 microgrammes, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Cox, who has no past convictions, was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and taken to a police station, where she failed to give a required specimen of breath.</p>
      <p>She has now been fined Â£276 and banned from the roads for 12 months during a hearing at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/courts">North Tyneside Magistrates' Court</a> after she admitted failing to provide the specimen of breath.</p>
      <p>Clare Irving, prosecuting, said Cox, of Burnett Close, Wallsend, was involved in an accident at around 9pm on October 12 before failing the roadside breath test.</p>
      <p>"She's fully compliant with the officers and continues to be at the station," Ms Irving said. "She agrees to provide a breath test but provides an incomplete sample.</p>
      <p>"She's asked if there is a medical reason for her doing so but she replies 'Not really'."</p>
      <p>Mark Harrison, defending, said Cox had been out in<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre"> Newcastle City Centre</a> for food and drinks with her friend before they returned to her home in Wallsend.</p>
      <p>Mr Harrison added: "She agreed to drive her friend home as she was clearly panicked about having to walk across Wallsend after dark.</p>
      <p>"With the benefit of hindsight, they should have called a cab."</p>
      <p>Mr Harrison said that Cox did not wish to drive her car again, even after getting her licence back in a year.</p>
