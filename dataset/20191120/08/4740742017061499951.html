      <p>Supermarket giant Asda has confirmed it will be taking part in this year's Black Friday after opting out of the discount event for the last few years, reports the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/asda-george-home-taking-part-17279415">Liverpool Echo</a></p>
      <p>Asda has released some of its deals already - 10 days before this year's <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday official date</a> (November 29).</p>
      <p>Customers are encouraged to stock up on early <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas presents</a> as Asda is offering 50% off tech products like TVs and tablets.</p>
      <p>Deals are available in selected stores and they are expected to sell out fast.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Offers include</b>
      </p>
      <p>RCA Gemini 2in1 10" Tablet was £129, now £89</p>
      <p>Fitbit Inspire was £69, now £49</p>
      <p>Polaroid 49" Smart TV was £299, now £229</p>
      <p>9 Piece Tefal Pan Set was £70, now £40</p>
      <p>Now TV Stick was £30, now £15</p>
      <p>Asda stopped taking part in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> after chaotic scenes erupted across its stores in 2016 when shoppers started fighting over discounted televisions and other products.</p>
      <p>Its clothing range George offered 20% off partywear in 2018 but Asda stores didn't offer any discounts on technology products.</p>
      <p>Therefore, people who are looking for additional bargains this Black Friday will be delighted to see once again that Asda are offering Black Friday deals.</p>
      <p>Technology products are always popular during the Black Friday sales. Argos, Amazon and Currys PC World have all already launched early Black Friday sales on everything from TVs to Apple Airpods.</p>
