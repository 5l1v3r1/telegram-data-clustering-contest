        <b>Britain's former marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe is to coach US runner Jordan Hasay, who has left the disbanded Nike Oregon Project.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hasay, 28, is the second-fastest American woman over the marathon.</p>
      <p>"I'm excited and honoured to have Paula Radcliffe as my coaching advisor," she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5EtvYclsug/">said on Instagram.</a></p>
      <p>Nike<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/50011044"> ended its NOP training programme</a> for elite athletes in October after leading coach<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/athletics/49882757"> Alberto Salazar was banned</a> by the US Anti-Doping Agency.</p>
      <p>Salazar, who is Mo Farah's former coach, was given a four-year ban for doping offences which included tampering with doping control methods.</p>
      <p>Usada's report did not find evidence of performance-enhancing drugs being used on or by any NOP athletes.</p>

      <p>Hasay ran two hours 20 minutes 57 seconds at the 2017 Chicago Marathon, placing her behind only Olympic medallist Deena Castor (2:19:36) on the US all-time list.</p>
      <p>Radcliffe's 2:15:25 was the world record for 16 years until it was broken by Kenyan Brigid Kosgei's 2:14:04 in Chicago this year, where Hasay, one of the pre-race favourites, failed to finish.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to working with Paula, whose expertise in being the former world record holder in the marathon is unparalleled," added Hasay, who has only run three marathons.</p>
      <p>"I have always looked up to Paula as a pioneer for what is possible in the marathon, and most importantly in being a kind and inspiring person in life. I hope to follow in her footsteps as I continue my journey in the sport."</p>
