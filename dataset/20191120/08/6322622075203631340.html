      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): A PKR leader has denied having circulated a message saying PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim had gone to Istana Negara today for an audience with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong.</p>
      <p>Ahmad Fahmi Mohamed Fadzil, the PKR communication director, said the message circulating on social media since this morning is fake and intended to embarrass him.</p>
      <p>“I wish to confirm that I did not circulate the message. That is a despicable, dirty and irresponsible act,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ahmad Fahmi said he will lodge a police report because his name has been used by irresponsible people for a political purpose.</p>
      <p>The message circulated over WhatsApp went like this: “PKR communication director Fahmi Fadzil confirms that Anwar is at Istana Negara for an audience with YDP (Yang di-Pertuan Agong). Media friends are asked to be in front of the palace for coverage.”</p>
      <p>Anwar was at Parliament early today to attend the Dewan Rakyat sitting. He arrived at 9.50am, and immediately confirmed that the message was fake.</p>
