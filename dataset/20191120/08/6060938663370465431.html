      <p>Federer won his last Grand Slam in January 2018 when he claimed his sixth <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Australian-Open">Australian Open</a> but the Swiss has won seven ATP titles since then, taking his career tally to 103.</p>

      <p>"My retirement will depend on my health. At the moment I do not see any reason to retire," the 20-time Grand Slam champion told reporters ahead of his exhibition matches in South America.</p>
      <p>"I did not think I would play beyond 35, 36 years and here I am. I am doing well physically. I cannot predict when it will be the time to stop.</p>
      <p>"I think in 2009 I questioned it for the first time. (It has been) 10 years and here I am. I'm exactly where I wanted to be at this age."</p>

      <p>"With age everything gets a bit more difficult," Federer added. "But at the same time, with experience also you can savour the moments more.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how it's going to end. I hope it's just going to be somewhat emotional I guess and nice ... I just hope it's going to be good, the whole process, and not too difficult."</p>
