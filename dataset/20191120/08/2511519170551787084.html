      <p>New <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> admitted he felt “very sorry” for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> after last season’s Champions League final defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Spurs lost 2-0 to the Reds in Madrid, ending their incredible run in Europe under the Argentine.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho​ showed sympathy for his contemporary, even admitting he feels “very sorry” for the Argentine.</p>
      <p>“That’s the drama of football and sometimes it’s not fair,” Mourinho said after Pochettino’s run without a trophy at Spurs.</p>
      <p>“Mauricio has had four very good years at Spurs, brings them to the final for the Champions League, and he’s still waiting for the first trophy of his career.</p>
      <p>“I feel very sorry for Mauricio but I think the English supporter is very loyal and they know when people give everything. They are a bit different than in other countries when everything is just about winning.</p>
      <p>“I think the Tottenham fans are proud of their team. They still look to this team and this manager as a historical team for them.</p>
      <p>“They will feel some love at home and next season when they go back to business, they will go with the pride of what they did and not in a low.”</p>

      <p>While Mourinho also delivered a damning verdict on Harry Kane’s performance in Madrid.</p>
      <p>“Harry Kane was hidden all the time,” he added. “He normally drops back, comes in between the lines, normally he’s the link player.</p>
      <p>“He receives the ball from one side, he goes between the lines, he turns, plays with the other full back, arrives in the box. Nothing of this dynamic yet.”</p>
