      <p>This also reflected a 2.9 per cent increase when compared to what was recorded in October 2018.</p>
      <p>‘”Similarly, the average price per gallon paid by consumers for kerosene decreased by -0.61per cent month-on-month and increased by 3.15 per cent year-on-year to N1,209.84 in October 2019 from N1,217.28 in September 2019,” it said.</p>
