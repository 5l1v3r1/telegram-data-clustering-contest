      <p><b>INVERNESS, Fla. (AP) -- </b>A north Florida county commission voted against paying for a digital New York Times subscription for the local library after previously gaining attention for calling the newspaper "fake news."</p>
      <p>The Citrus County Commission heard from residents before voting 3-2 on Tuesday against replacing hard copies of the newspaper with a $2,900 annual digital subscription.</p>
      <p>Controversy erupted last month when commissioners considered the digital subscription, and Commissioner Scott Carnahan said he didn't "want the New York Times in this county." He said he agrees with President Donald Trump in calling it "fake news."</p>
      <p>The Tampa Bay Times reports so many people showed up for Tuesday's hearing that they opened an overflow room.</p>
      <p>Carnahan said he wouldn't back down from his original opinion, adding that he doesn't think public money should be used for news subscriptions.</p>
