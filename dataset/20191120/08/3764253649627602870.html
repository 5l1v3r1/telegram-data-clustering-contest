      <p>News of the <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277221-mauricio-pochettino-sacked-premier-league-side-tottenham-poor-run-form.html">sacking of Mauricio Pochettino by Tottenham</a> has been met with excitement from a section of Manchester United fans who would prefer to have him as their manager instead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>Some believe dismissing Pochettino after a five-year stint at Tottenham was probably a bad move, one that could also be costly for the club in the long run.</p>
      <p>Aside from reaching the Champions League final, Pochettino established the London side as one of the regulars in Europe’s elite competition, sometimes at the expense of bitter rivals <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/arsenal-fc-news-now.html">Arsenal</a>.</p>

      <p>Others were adamant Poch would definitely return the glory days back at United, especially because he was on the Red Devils’ radar even before the appointment of Ole.</p>
