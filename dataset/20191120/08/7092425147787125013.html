      <p>"We've also identified that that impact on health lasts well beyond childhood and can be the cause of ill health in adulthood, things like depression, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes and obesity," she told <a href="https://www.98fm.com/news/children-living-poor-housing-likely-develop-serious-illnesses-926980"><i>98FM</i></a>.</p>
