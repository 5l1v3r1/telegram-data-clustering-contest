      <p>Life is full of <a href="https://www.inc.com/larry-kim/how-to-de-stress-at-work-instantly-15-proven-ways-to-calm-your-mind.html">stressful moments</a>, but when it seems like everything is happening all at once, it can really drain your emotional battery. You may not even realize you’re running on low until it starts affecting your productivity at work, your social life or your relationships. That’s why it’s important that you <a href="https://www.inc.com/rene-siegel/seven-ways-to-recharge-your-batteries.html">take time regularly to recharge</a>. </p>
      <p>So, check out these seven easy ways to recharge your emotional battery. With many of these tips, you don’t even have to wait until you’re at home; you can <a href="https://www.inc.com/matthew-swyers/recharge-your-batteries-3-steps.html">recharge at work or on the go</a>. </p>
      <h3>Get some exercise.</h3>
      <p>To some, exercise may seem like a chore and not an enjoyable way to recharge your emotional battery. But, if you share this sentiment, you should probably change your mind. Sweating it out is one of the best ways to recharge your emotional batteries. </p>
      <p>It doesn’t have to be a hard workout at the gym, either. You could take a walk, do yoga, dance around the room, ride a bike -- whatever it is, just make sure to move your body. In fact, according to studies published in <i><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-exercise-make-us-feel-good/">Scientific American</a></i>, “People who engaged in even a small amount of exercise reported better mental health than others who did none.”</p>
      <h3>Take a nap.</h3>
      <p>To recharge your emotional battery, sometimes you just need to get a little shut-eye. According to the <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/napping">National Sleep Foundation</a>, napping has psychological benefits: “A nap can be a pleasant luxury, a mini-vacation. It can provide an easy way to get some relaxation and rejuvenation.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it’s not wise to take a nap during work hours when you’re supposed to be getting work done. But, as soon as your workday is done, find a cozy spot at home and take 15 or 20 minutes to get some rest. </p>
      <h3>Declutter your life.</h3>
      <p>If your mind is cluttered, it may be because your life is cluttered. So, if you want to recharge your emotional battery and clear your head, do a little cleaning and decluttering. Does your messy filing cabinet at work make you feel overwhelmed? Organize it! Is your computer crowded with unnecessary files? Delete everything you no longer need! </p>
      <p>By decluttering, you won’t only get a clean space; you’ll also get a clear mind as well. Still not convinced? Binge watch <i>Tidying Up with Marie Kondo</i> on Netflix, and you’ll discover the power of decluttering. </p>
      <h3>Try something new.</h3>
      <p>Sometimes you need to shake things up a bit to get refreshed and reenergized. So, try something new. You could travel to a new place, join a local club or class or take up a new hobby. </p>
      <p>Thanks to the internet, you don’t even have to leave your desk to try something new. For example, you can take a free online course or join a membership site to learn a new skill and interact with new people. </p>
      <h3>Treat yourself.</h3>
      <p>Of course, one of the most relaxing and enjoyable ways to recharge your emotional battery is by doing something nice for yourself. Whatever you enjoy, whether it’s going to the spa, curling up with a good book, doing a little retail therapy -- just do it. </p>
      <p>We all need to spend a little more time treating ourselves and doing what makes us truly happy. </p>
      <h3>Meditate.</h3>
      <p>If you haven’t tried meditation before, now is the time to give it a go. Meditation is a practice that people use to achieve a mentally clear, emotionally calm and stable state. So, it’s the perfect activity to recharge your emotional battery. </p>
      <p>For beginners, try downloading a mediation app like Calm or Insight Timer to help you get started. </p>
      <h3>Talk it out.</h3>
      <p>Keeping everything bottled up inside doesn’t do any good. So, if you need to recharge your emotional battery, talk it out. Getting frustrated with work and feeling stressed? Talk to a trusted coworker who can relate to you. </p>
      <p>Or, if you’re feeling overwhelmed with family, kids and household chores, go out for coffee with a good friend to chat. Talking about what’s going on not only lets you vent, but also allows you to gain some valuable advice from the people you open up to. </p>
      <p>With these easy ways to recharge your emotional battery, you can make sure you’re running on full more often. When your emotional battery is charged, you can move forward with the feeling that you can take on anything.</p>
