      <p>A book that seeks to restore the humanity of the women murdered by Jack the Ripper has won the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>'s leading nonfiction literary award.</p>
      <p>Historian Hallie Rubenhold was awarded the 50,000 pound ($65,000) Baillie Gifford Prize on Tuesday for The Five: The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper. </p>
      <p>Rubenhold shifts the focus from the killer who terrorized London's East End in 1888 - the subject of hundreds of books - to his victims. </p>
      <p>Rubenhold said they were "ordinary people, like you and I, who happened to fall upon hard times."</p>
      <p>Stig Abell, who chaired the judging panel, said the book "spoke with an urgency and passion to our own times".</p>
      <p>The award recognises English-language books in current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts. </p>
