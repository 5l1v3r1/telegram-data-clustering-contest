        <b>With the satisfactory assistance of 82.5 percent, the Second Process of Accountability of the delegates to their electors end in the province of Las Tunas, corresponding to the 17th Period of Mandate of the Municipal Assemblies of the People's Power, developed between the first of October and November 15.</b>

      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- More than 346 thousand 600 citizens attended the assemblies, and 9,236 approaches were collected. Among the concerns issued, the most repeated were the repair of streets and neighborhood roads, solid waste collection, restoration of hydraulic networks and electric luminaries.</p>
      <p>The solutions of 5,901 approaches compete to the agents and inhabitants of the respective constituencies, while the other 3,335 are responsibilities of different agencies.</p>
      <p>The meetings became key scenarios to reflect on the necessary improvement in living conditions in the communities, the support for the Revolution and saving measures to address fuel shortages, condemn the intensification of the US blockade against Cuba, strengthen hygienic-sanitary actions in the neighborhoods, and the confrontation with manifestations of corruption, illegalities and social indiscipline.</p>
      <p>Valuable opinions of evaluators of the process are computed with the criterion of having them into account, as a mechanism to improve and make more attractive the neighborhood meetings and increase the attendance, mainly of young people.</p>
      <p>José Serrano Brito, an official of the Provincial Assembly of the People's Power, stressed that among the particularities of the process are the insertion of the information in an automated system for the first time, which expedited the transfer from municipalities to the province and from there to the nation, as part of the effectiveness of electronic government; and that voters can follow the course of their approaches through the Citizen Portal.</p>
