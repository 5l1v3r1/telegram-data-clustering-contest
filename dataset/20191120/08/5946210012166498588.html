      <h1>Trump Impeachment Inquiry, Day 4: Watch the Live Stream of the House Intelligence Committee’s Open Hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:45:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/the-new-yorker" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a></address>
      <p>On Wednesday, Gordon Sondland and two other witnesses testify in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, midway through the second week of the open hearings in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> impeachment inquiry, the House Intelligence Committee will hear from a highly anticipated witness: Gordon Sondland, the U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. During closed-door testimony, in October, Sondland told congressional investigators that Trump had asked him to work with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, the President’s private attorney, on dealings with the Ukrainian President, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>. But at the time Sondland denied under oath that the White House had attempted to engage in any kind of quid pro quo with the government of Ukraine. Then his memory was refreshed. In a revised statement, Sondland said that the testimony of other witnesses had jogged his recollection and that, in fact, he remembered telling an adviser to Zelensky that the U.S. would likely resume sending military aid to Ukraine only after the President made a public statement about investigating Burisma, the Ukrainian natural-gas company that recruited <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>’s son <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/07/08/will-hunter-biden-jeopardize-his-fathers-campaign">Hunter</a> to its board. After the news broke, John Cassidy <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-own-donor-diplomat-blows-up-his-impeachment-defense">wrote</a>, “That crash you heard was the sound of Donald Trump’s Ukrainegate defense, which was already looking very fragile, shattering into pieces.”</p>
      <p>Aside from those newly remembered facts, a focus of Wednesday’s questioning likely will be a July 26th phone call between Sondland and Trump. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-bad-week-for-trump-got-worse-with-a-new-impeachment-witness">David Holmes</a>, a diplomat stationed at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, testified in a private hearing on Friday that he had been sitting with Sondland at a restaurant in Kyiv when the call had occurred and—because the President was speaking so loudly—was able to hear both sides of the conversation. Holmes testified that Sondland told Trump that Zelensky “loves your ass.” According to Holmes, Trump then asked Sondland whether the Ukrainian President was going to go ahead with the investigation of Hunter Biden. “He’s gonna do it,” Sondland allegedly <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-bad-week-for-trump-got-worse-with-a-new-impeachment-witness">responded</a>, adding that Zelensky will do “anything you ask him to.” Two other U.S. officials seated at the table may also be able to corroborate Holmes’s account of the conversation. When Sondland is questioned by the committee members on Wednesday, it seems certain that he will have to confirm or deny it himself.</p>
      <p>Laura Cooper, of the Department of Defense, and David Hale, of the State Department, will also testify. You can watch the entire day of testimony on the live stream above.</p>
