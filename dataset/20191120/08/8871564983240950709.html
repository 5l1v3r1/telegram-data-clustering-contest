      <h1>Evening News: Jason Lo accused of testing positive for meth, criminal trespassing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:52:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20KL" target="_blank">Coconuts KL</a></address>
      <p>Jason Lo’s fall from grace continues, with the former telco CEO and one-time popular singer-songwriter making two separate court appearances this week to answer to two different charges.</p>
      <p>According to court records, Lo was accused of criminal trespassing at a residence in the upmarket Bangsar Park neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur at around 10pm on Oct. 30. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge, which carries a punishment of three years in prison, and/or a RM5,000 (US$1,250) fine.</p>
      <p>Bail was set at RM2,000 (US$500), with his hearing set for Dec. 17.</p>
      <p>In a different court, Lo was again called before a judge to answer to charges that he <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/hiburan/500323">tested positive for methamphetamine</a>.</p>
      <p>Lo again pleaded not guilty, and was released on a RM2,500 (US$625) bail, with one surety. His drug case will be heard on Dec. 30.</p>
      <p>Never far from unsavory headlines, Lo has in recent years found himself accused of drug charges while traveling in the Middle East, and most recently made headlines after publicly outing himself as the subject of what he called an <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/a-summary-of-the-sordid-story-of-a-former-telco-ceo-his-ex-wife-and-allegations-he-molested-their-children/">erroneous report by <i>The Star</i> that anonymously accused a “former telco CEO” of molesting his own children</a>.</p>
      <p>He was also accused of trespassing on his ex-wife’s property. Lo says he was merely trying to see his child, whom he had not seen in months thanks to the acrimonious split with the child’s mother.</p>
      <p>Formerly married to television personality Ann Ibrahim, Lo has custody of two of their children, while his wife has custody of their third child.</p>
