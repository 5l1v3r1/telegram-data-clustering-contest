        <b>Kodak Black has reportedly asked a judge to be approved for a drug rehab program in prison, days after he allegedly claimed to be ‘drugged’ right before a brawl with another inmate. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Zeze rapper was sentenced to 46 months in prison earlier this month after pleading guilty to weapons charges.</p>
      <p>It was reported last week that Kodak, real name Bill K Kapri, was involved in a huge prison brawl in October with his reps claiming another inmate slipped a substance in his drink around 20 minutes before the brawl broke out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/19/kodak-black-rehab-program-prison-florida/">TMZ now reports</a> that the 22-year-old rapper has requested to be sent to a prison that offers the Residential Drug Abuse Program.</p>
      <p>The scheme lasts for nine months and involves group therapy in addition to one-on-one treatment. Through the program, inmates are allowed to live in a separate unit to the general population.</p>

      <p>But perhaps the most appealing draw is that participants could see their sentences dramatically cut short by as much as 12 months.</p>
      <p>The judge is yet to make a decision on the request.</p>

      <p>Kodak’s team reportedly believe he was set up in the prison brawl, as he was seen drinking from a coffee cup which they claim was spiked with a chemical substance shortly before the incident, causing his behaviour to change.</p>
      <p>An FBI agent allegedly testified that inmates said Kodak appeared to be under the influence during the fight.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed Kodak had to be restrained by several prison guards before being sprayed with mace after getting into a brawl with another inmate.</p>
      <p>Emery Nelson, a spokesperson from the Bureau of Prisons, confirmed that a prison staff member was physically assaulted during the brawl and required hospital treatment.</p>
      <p>Kodak’s reps said they didn’t know who allegedly drugged him but had suspicions.</p>
      <p>The rapper was arrested before his performance at Rolling Loud festival in Miami in May and admitted to falsifying information on forms in order to buy four guns.</p>
      <p>After his sentencing, Kodak’s lawyer Bradford Cohen told BBC News: ‘After the court was apprised of all the facts and circumstances of this case and the good charitable work that Bill has done over the years, the court rejected the government’s request of 96 months and sentenced Bill to 46 months.’</p>
