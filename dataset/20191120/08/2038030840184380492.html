      <h1>Meghan Markle addresses 'untrue and offensive' tabloid rumours head-on in new court documents</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:38:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:38</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/prince-harry-and-duchess-meghan-file-multiple-lawsuits-against-the-british-press-and-piers-morgan-could-be-next-20191005"><b>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex recently decided to take legal action</b></a> against Associated Newspapers with Prince Harry stating it's been "painful" to see the tabloid press deliberately misrepresent the couple, Meghan specifically. Now, new court documents are revealing the extent of their allegedly "ruthless campaign".</p>
      <p>In the documents filed on behalf of the duke and duchess by their legal team Schillings, Her Royal Highness slams the "untrue and offensive" stories published by the press and the narratives created concerning her baby shower, the renovations done at the couple's home in Windsor and the private letter she sent to her father.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE LETTER</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the documents, in February of this year, the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a "private and confidential" letter Meghan had written in 2018 to her father. The letter was "obviously private correspondence" and detailed "her intimate thoughts and feelings about her father's health and her relationship with him at that time".</p>
      <p>Further, the document alleges the publications "chose to deliberately omit or suppress" parts of the letter, which "intentionally distorted or manipulated" its context.</p>
      <p>"The claimant intended the detailed contents of the letter to be private, and certainly did not expect them to be published to the world at large by a national newspaper, and without any warning," the document states, according to <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/a29840214/meghan-markle-court-documents/"><b>ELLE</b></a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE BABY SHOWER</b>
      </p>
      <p>With regard to her New York City <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/heres-why-kate-missed-meghans-lavish-baby-shower-20190221"><b>baby shower</b></a> with close friends Serena Williams and Amal Clooney, the court documents reveal the claims made about the supposed $300k (over R4 million) splurge is "untrue and offensive", reports <a href="https://www.etonline.com/meghan-markle-refutes-untrue-and-offensive-tabloid-stories-in-new-court-documents-136623"><b>ET</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"The baby shower (which actually cost a tiny fraction of the $300k falsely stated in the article) was organised and hosted by one of her best friends from university," the court papers read.</p>
      <p>"The 15 guests who attended the shower were close friends and included long-term friendships some of which had existed for over 20 years."</p>
      <p>Further, Meghan also refuted claims that she didn't invite her mother to the event.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE RENOVATIONS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the tabloid press blew up after they reported on <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/4-things-about-the-royal-finances-this-year-that-will-totally-surprise-you-20190625"><b>the royals' alleged spending</b></a> on renovations for their personal home.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://people.com/royals/meghan-markle-tackles-tabloid-rumors-about-frogmore-cottage-baby-shower-and-dad-in-court-documents/"><b>People</b></a>, the court documents specify the couple did not include a $6 500 (over R96 000) copper bathtub, $650 000 (Over R9 million) of aircraft soundproofing, a self-contained yoga studio, "guest wing" for Meghan's mother, orangery or a tennis court as reported by the press.</p>
