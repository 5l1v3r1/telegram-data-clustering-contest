      <h1>Bird's first non-electric scooter is made for kids</h1>
      <h2>Say hello to the Birdie.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:19:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/nick-summers" target="_blank">Nick Summers</a></address>
      <p>Bird is making <a href="https://birdie.bird.co/">a traditional kick-powered scooter</a> for kids. The California-based startup, which has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/12/bird-scooter-europe-50-cities/">flooded countless cities</a> with dockless electric scooters, will sell its child-friendly Birdie for $129 throughout the holiday season. The vehicle comes in three colors -- Jet Black, Dove White and Electric Rose -- and has all of the basic features you would expect from a three-wheeled scooter, such as height-adjustable handlebars, a lean-to-steer frame and rear-mounted "stomp brake." The company has warned that only "a limited number" are being made, so act fast if you fancy one.</p>
      <p>So why is Bird making this? The company has no plans, it seems, to add the Birdie to its electric scooter and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/04/bird-cruiser/">cruiser bike</a> fleets. In <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meet-birdie-birds-new-three-wheel-kids-scooter-300961579.html">a press release</a>, the startup said it was simply made "in response to a demand for a non-electric scooter designed for kids." Birdies could increase the company's festive-period revenue and reinforce the brand with a demographic that will -- should the dockless scooter phenomenon survive long enough -- eventually be able to download the app and spend their own money on motorized rides. It's the same reason why countless car manufacturers, <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/tesla-model-s-for-kids?sku=1465593-00-A">including Tesla</a>, have made kid-sized versions of their most iconic vehicles.</p>

      <p>Travis VanderZanden, CEO of Bird said: "Birdies are a fun way to give a nod to the founding of Bird and to give families the opportunity to ride together." It's a nice idea, though I can't imagine a child -- especially one riding a push-powered Birdie -- keeping up with a parent's electric scooter.</p>
