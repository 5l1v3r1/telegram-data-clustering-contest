      <p>Nearly a month after 27 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) kicked up a storm with their visit to the Kashmir Valley, the MHA has called the visit a private one at the invitation of International institute of Non Aligned studies, a Delhi-based think tank.</p>
      <p>This was stated by MoS Home, G Kishan Reddy, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha. MHA has made no mention of Madi Sharma or the Women's Economic and Social Think Tank (WESTT).</p>
      <p>The government of Jammu and Kashmir has said that a group of 27 members of European Parliament who belong to different political parties including ruling and opposition parties paid a private visit to Kashmir on October 28, at the invitation of Institute for Non-Aligned Studies, a Delhi-based think tank.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, a delegation of Indian MPs from opposition parties was not allowed to visit Kashmir Valley over security concerns.</p>
      <p>The familiarisation visit by MEPs was facilitated was arranged as they had expressed the desire to visit Kashmir to understand how terrorism is affecting India and how it has been a challenge for India.</p>
      <p>The Home Ministry further said how terrorism poses a threat to India, especially in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Calling the visit fruitful, MHA said such exchanges promote a deep people-to-people contact and ultimately it feeds into the larger relationship, which any two countries would like to develop.</p>
