      <p>The Supreme Court has asked the Kerala government to frame a separate law for the management of Sabarimala Temple.</p>
      <p>While insisting on the need for a new law, the Supreme Court asked the Kerala government to frame the law by the third week of January 2020.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Justice Ranjan Gogoi had decided to refer the Sabarimala issue to a larger bench to re-examine religious issues including those arising out of its 2018 verdict lifting a centuries-old ban on women of menstruating age visiting the hilltop shrine.</p>

      <p>Hearing a petition filed by Pandalam Royal Family to protect their rights, the Supreme Court took exception to the Kerala governmentâ€™s attempt to change laws dealing with the administration of Sabarimala and other temples.</p>
      <p>On the provision of 1/3rd quota for women in the Temple Advisory Committees, the SC asked, How can there be women in the panel when a 7-judge Bench is yet to examine the question of essential religious practices.</p>
      <p>In reply, the Kerala government told the SC that involving women in temples' administration was part of its liberal push.</p>
      <p>The Kerala government was asked to frame a new law for Sabarimala temple on August 27. However, it produced draft amendments in the Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act in the SC. This is not enough. Need for a new, exclusive law for the administration of Sabarimala temple, the SC noted.</p>
      <p>The order was passed in a plea filed by the Pandalam royal family over the temple administration. The dispute first came into light in 2006 on the management of the temple and the nearby mosque.</p>
