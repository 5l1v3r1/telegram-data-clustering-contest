      <p>Actor Saqib Saleem wanted to be a cricketer while growing up. Now, he is giving a finishing touch to his performance in the upcoming cricket-based film “<i>83</i>“.</p>
      <p>“Doing ‘<i>83</i>‘ was almost like an act of fate. I grew up playing cricket, wanting to go pro. I played state level U-19 cricket, but that was that. When I decided to become an actor, I knew that life was going to take a whole new path. When I heard about Kabir (Khan) sir casting for ‘<i>83</i>‘, I chased him to ensure that I was able to at least audition,” said Saqib.</p>

      <p>He also has a solid connection with the character he plays — the Man of the Match of the 1983 World Cup final — Mohinder aka ‘<i>Jimmy</i>‘ Amarnath.</p>
      <p>“Mohinder Amarnath was my father’s favourite cricketer. I remember hearing some of the legendary stories from my dad when I was young. He was always an icon in my mind. When ’83’ happened, I was most excited to tell my dad, because not only was I getting to play him on screen, I was also going to be learning and training with the man himself. And when it all came to life, I truly felt like I was having an out of body experience,” said the actor.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, Saqib has another connection with Mohinder Amarnath. They had worked together for the 2016 film <i>“Dishoom”</i> in which Saqib played a young cricketer and Amarnath played himself as the coach of the team.</p>
