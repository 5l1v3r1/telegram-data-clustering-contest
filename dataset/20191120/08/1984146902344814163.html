      <h1>Sunderland out of the FA Cup after one of the dullest games ever - January can't come quick enough</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland lost 1-0 at Gillingham in the FA Cup first round replay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Johns</a></address>
      <p>In a bid to end fixture congestion, replays have been scrapped from the FA Cup this season from round five onwards. Sunderland and Gillingham made their own case to scrap them altogether with one of the dullest games of football you’re ever likely to watch.</p>
      <p>Never mind magic of the FA Cup, so bad was this first round replay at Priestfield Stadium, neither side mustered a single shot on target in the 90 minutes prior to extra time.</p>
      <p>Finally, in the 105th minute, Brandon Hanlan fired Gillingham 1-0 ahead. The first, and only, shot on target to wrap the game up and send Sunderland out of the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>While the competition might not be a priority for Sunderland, the concern is that this is yet another game with which Sunderland looked totally inept in the final third.</p>
      <p>Phil Parkinson went three at the back for the game, most likely to offer extra protection for Brandon Taylor - called up from the under-23s with Alim Ozturk the only senior centre-back available for the game.</p>
      <p>This was a game that neither side really wanted, and both sides played that way in the first half too.</p>

      <p>Among the worst 45 minutes of football you’re likely to see, the only thing keeping this reporter awake was the loud barks of Gillingham manager Steve Evans on the touchline down from the press box.</p>
      <p>Neither goalkeeper was tested before the break with anything of note.</p>
      <p>The only time any side came anywhere close to breaking the deadlock in the first 45 minutes came when Max Power’s cross from the right-hand side was mis-hit and almost caught Jack Bonham out. He was sharp enough to retreat and palm the ball out.</p>
      <p>Just moments later Chris Maguire teed up Power from just outside the area and central this time. His shot flew into row Z this time.</p>
      <p>Gillingham had a bit more intent, but lacked any quality.</p>
      <p>The lively Brandon Hanlan outmuscled young Taylor to glance a header wide, despite an otherwise solid display from the academy graduate in just his second senior start. The Gills forward also had the beating of Laurens De Bock in the air not long before the break. His resulting shot was deflected wide off the heel of Ozturk.</p>

      <p>There won’t have been many sorry to hear the half time whistle at Priestfield.</p>
      <p>Sunderland were clearing their lines well enough at the back. Their issues, as they have been so often of late, were further up the pitch.</p>
      <p>The midfield were missed out time and time again, Will Grigg and Duncan Watmore - the forward two - rarely competed for the long balls directed at them, as the ball just kept coming back. Sunderland treated the ball like a ticking time-bomb. No player had the composure to put their foot on the ball and do something meaningful with it.</p>
      <p>Whenever there was a half-decent ball forward Grigg seemed to lose his footing - much to Parkinson’s growing frustration.</p>
      <p>Any hope the second half would be an improvement were short-lived, however. It was 63 minutes before a match note was made. That was Sunderland’s first substitution as Aiden McGeady replaced Watmore.</p>
      <p>McGeady scored Sunderland’s goal in the first leg but even he could provide no magic though as the 90 minutes ended goalless without an official shot on target from either side.</p>
      <p>Young Taylor made sure that was the case in the third minute of stoppage time when he threw himself in the way of a close-range Hanlan effort to block and the receive a huge hug from goalkeeper Lee Burge.</p>
      <p>To extra time it went, with 329 Sunderland fans who travelled probably wishing they’d stayed at home to watch Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn argue like school children.</p>
      <p>Gillingham came closest to breaking the deadlock in extra time. Captain Max Ehmer smashed a half volley from the edge of the box onto the bar. It might have looked like it wasn’t coming at all, but instead it inspired the hosts.</p>

      <p>Moments after Alfie Jones fired over from the edge, the ball broke kindly for Hanlan and he fittingly wrapped the tie up - smashing the ball across goal and into the bottom. Over the two legs he looked the most exciting player of either side and finally had his just rewards.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, there was no second half response from this Sunderland side who look so mentally fragile right now. All of Parkinson’s early promise is out of the window. The last four performances, albeit all in the cups, have been nothing short of abhorrent.</p>
      <p>Massive improvements are needed, especially on Saturday when attention turns back to the league finally and a decent Coventry side visit the Stadium of Light.</p>
      <p>With Parkinson finding little answers on the training pitches right now, you have to feel he’s praying for January.</p>
