      <h1>Crown Minerals Act review welcome but requires consideration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/PEPANZ" target="_blank">PEPANZ</a></address>
      <p>The review of the Crown Minerals Act has been welcomed by the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand (PEPANZ).</p>
      <p>"This is a major piece of work that is very important to the future of New Zealand’s energy system and economic well-being. It will have a big impact on ensuring New Zealanders have affordable, reliable and sustainable energy for decades to come," says PEPANZ spokesman Phil Rennie.</p>
      <p>"We support the Government’s goal of a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy. Our sector has a major role to play in this, especially natural gas which will be a key transition fuel providing lower-emissions energy.</p>
      <p>"We also support the proposal for greater flexibility for existing offshore permit holders, given the implications of the ban on new exploration permits last year.</p>
      <p>"There are significant issues raised that will require careful consideration such as changing the purpose of the Act and adding wider non-economic priorities. We need to be careful not to undermine the smooth transition both Government and industry are keen to support.</p>
      <p>"We are very concerned at the short timeframe at a busy time of the year with submissions closing in just over four weeks.</p>
      <p>"It’s crucial this process isn’t rushed and we take the time to get it right, given the substantive nature of the proposals and the serious implications.</p>
      <p>"Experience tells us that rushed law is rarely good law. A submission period concluding in the New Year rather than right before Christmas would be more befitting such a complex piece of policy and legislation."</p>
