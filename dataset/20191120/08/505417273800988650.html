        <b>Tottenham have announced the appointment of former Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho as their new head coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/football/mcorry/pochettino-spurs-sacked/">The club confirmed last night</a> that Mauricio Pochettino had left Tottenham after a successful five years in charge which culminated in Spurs reaching last year’s Champions League final.</p>
      <p>This season however they have struggled, sitting 14th in the table and 11 points behind the top four after a hugely disappointing start to the campaign.</p>

      <p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy acted quickly in appointing the Argentine’s successor with Mourinho joining the club until the end of the 2022/2023 season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has not managed since he was sacked by Manchester United last December but has been one of the most successful managers of the modern era having won 25 senior trophies and managed in Portugal, Italy, Spain and England.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">said Mourinho.</a></p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>

      <p>Mourinho’s first game will be at the London Stadium on Saturday as Tottenham travel to take on West Ham in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the appointment, Levy said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>The Portuguese’s appointment could be an interesting one for the career of 17-year-old Irish striker Troy Parrott who has found himself on the cusp of the Spurs first team this season.</p>

      <p>Mourinho has not been overly keen on investing in youth in the past so Parrott may find himself down the pecking order when the new boss arrives at the club.</p>
