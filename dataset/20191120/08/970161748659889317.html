      <h1>Driver fined £120 for pulling over while having diabetic episode</h1>

      <p>A diabetic driver has been handed a £120 fine after he pulled over when his blood sugar levels dropped.</p>
      <p>Andy Lindsay, 52, suffered a hypoglycaemic attack during his journey, and so stopped at Calder Park Industrial State, next to the M1 in Wakefield.</p>
      <p>His car was photographed and he received a £100 fine from Excel Parking a few days later in March this year.</p>
      <p>Despite him submitting medical evidence the fine has gone up to £120 and he is now being threatened with court.</p>
      <p>Andy’s wife, Bronwyn O’Brien, 47, said the firm have shown ‘no common sense’ in their handling of the issue.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘We understand the fine, but what we don’t understand is that we have appealed it three times now and there seems to be no common sense.</p>

      <p>‘Imagine if he had carried on driving and killed someone – I’m sure the family of that person would have asked, “why didn’t you pull over?”</p>

      <p>‘I don’t think they would have understood if he had said, “well I didn’t want to get a fine”.’</p>
      <p>Andy, a sales representative, was diagnosed with type one diabetes at the age of 11.</p>
      <p>Those with the condition are advised by the DVLA not to drive when blood sugar levels drop below 5mmols (millimoles per litre).</p>
      <p>Symptoms of hypoglycaemic attacks include shakiness, dizziness, drowsiness and confusion, making it potentially dangerous for sufferers to remain behind the wheel.</p>
      <p>Bronwyn added: ‘If it had been a council parking ticket I’m sure they would have used common sense and let us off by now.</p>
      <p>‘This company feels like it’s just a money-making scheme and nothing to do with parking or safety. He could have been dead at the wheel for all they cared.’</p>
      <p>Excel Parking has been contacted for comment.</p>
