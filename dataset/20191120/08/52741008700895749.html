      <p>BANGKOK — Thailand's constitutional Court has ruled that the maverick leader of a new political party that finished third in a general election in March violated election laws and cannot keep his seat in Parliament.</p>
      <p>The court ruled Wednesday that Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, leader of the Future Forward Party, violated a regulation barring owners of media companies from running for Parliament.</p>
      <p>The court rejected Thanathorn’s claim that he sold his holding in a media production company before the deadline needed to be a candidate.</p>
      <p>The ruling had been expected. Thanathorn’s party has been a thorn in the side of Thailand’s conservative establishment, in whose favour the courts have consistently ruled. The party is disliked not only for its anti-military stance, but also because of its strong popularity.</p>
