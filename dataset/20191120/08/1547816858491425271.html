      <p>Looks like single Nia Sharma is ready to mingle. Why do we say so? Nia Sharma, who’s <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/naagin-bhagya-kaa-zehreela-khel-ekta-kapoor-officially-welcomes-nia-sharma-as-the-latest-naagin/5daeed0687fb571eff7e2de7">making news for her upcoming show Naagin 4,</a> spilled the beans on her ideal man. During a recent interview, when Nia was asked about the qualities she’s looking for in a partner she said that since an actor will understand the pressures of the trade, so she would love to have a handsome actor by her side. We hope all the handsome boys in the industry are listening.</p>
      <p>When Nia was asked about her previous relationships and keeping her love life under wraps, the actress told Bombay Times that she has never spoken about her personal life because she feels that her love life is not for Instagram. She also added that she’s nervous to share private pictures on her social media accounts. “In the last few years, a couple of relationships ended abruptly. I now feel that if I am with someone, I’d rather make it work than talk about it to people,” said Nia. <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/naagin-4-after-nia-sharma-ankita-lokhande-finalised-for-the-show-buzzing-now-exclusive/5db7efcc87fb571eff7e31f1">Naagin 4: After Nia Sharma, Ankita Lokhande Finalised For The Show, BUZZING NOW- EXCLUSIVE</a>)</b></p>

      <p>When asked about what qualities Nia is looking for in a partner, she said, she wants someone who is educated, someone who is mature enough to respect a woman irrespective of her profession. She clearly stated that she can’t be with a guy who is fighting with her over what she decides to wear. The actress says the relationship can’t be about the clothes that a girl wears.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the same Nia told BT, “I am what I am today because of my sheer hard work and discipline. Even my mother tells me, ‘Nia, we are happy for your success and you have the freedom to follow your desires’. So, I can’t allow a guy to dictate what I should wear to a party. Having said that, I am very accommodating and adjusting in a relationship. I want a guy who will let me pursue my ambitions, stand by my side and have full faith in me.”</p>

      <p> <br/>Nia also said that she finds it very funny when actors say that they don’t want to marry someone from the industry. “Actually an actor will exactly understand the pressures of the trade, your sense of fashion and the erratic working hours. I would love it if I have a handsome actor by my side,” asserts Nia.<br/><br/><br/><i>Images Source: instagram/niasharma90</i></p>
