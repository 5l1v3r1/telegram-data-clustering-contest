      <h1>Chuck Liddell explains why he would beat Mike Tyson in street fight</h1>
      <h2>Liddell came in for criticism after claiming he would beat Tyson - but the former UFC champion has explained his comments</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:27:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Chuck Liddell has reiterated his belief he would beat Mike Tyson in a street fight.</p>
      <p>The former UFC light-heavyweight champion first made the claim last week but came in for criticism on social media.</p>
      <p>But Liddell has taken to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to explain his comments.</p>
      <p>"I remember Tyson and I’m a huge fan of his but I’m not sure why biting [Evander] Holyfield’s ear off makes him a better street fighter or better at stopping takedowns?," he said.</p>
      <p>"1) I’m talking about when we were fighting, 2) I’d take him down so he’d have one shot on my way in [and] 3) I’m a big fan of Mike and have no desire to fight him, but hypothetically speaking, when we were fighting, yes I would've beat him!</p>

      <p>"He won’t get three minutes, I’d shoot right away. He had no ground training or takedown defence training at all. So he’d have to catch me on the way in or he’d never get off the ground period!</p>
      <p>"People are so funny. I like Mike and no we’re not getting in a street fight. I’m a huge fan of Mike and I never said I’d KO him I said I'd win.</p>
      <p>"I'd take him down it would make no sense to stand with him he’s a beast and yes devastating one punch power with both hands."</p>

      <p>Last September, Tyson admitted he would have struggled in a mixed martial arts fight.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know what I would do in the UFC, because I watched the UFC a couple of times, and I watched these guys step on people’s feet, and I have the worst feet in the world," he said.</p>
      <p>"And if somebody steps on my feet, I would totally tap out. I would just give up it would be a no-brainer."</p>
