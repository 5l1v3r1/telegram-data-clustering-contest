      <p>The two traffickers were carrying the animals on a motorbike on National Route 8A near the Cau Treo border gate when they were ordered to stop by the police for behaving suspiciously.</p>
      <p>But instead of stopping, they threw away a basket and fled. The police gave chase but in the thick night fog, they could not catch them.</p>
      <p>Back at the scene, officers found two baby tigers inside the basket.</p>

      <p>The cubs, each weighing around four kilograms, were handed over to Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, a non-profit organization for conserving wildlife.</p>
      <p>The police are looking for the two suspects.</p>
      <p>Violation of wildlife protection laws is punishable by up to seven years in jail.</p>
      <p>Vietnam is one of only 13 countries with tigers left in the wild.</p>
      <p>With their populations plunging, in 2010 the 13 countries pledged to double tiger numbers by 2022.</p>
      <p>But the animal remains <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-part-of-thriving-illegal-trade-in-tigers-3970784.html">critically endangered in Vietnam</a>, with only five left in the wild in 2016.</p>
      <p>Tigers are in demand in Vietnam for their skin, meat and bones. Some people believe tiger products can treat bone and joint ailments.</p>
