      <p>Twitter has warned that any further attempts to mislead the public on its platform during the UK General Election will lead to action by the social media giant.</p>
      <p>The warning comes as the Conservative Party faced criticism after one of its official Twitter accounts was rebranded as a fact-checking service during the ITV leaders’ debate on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account was renamed “factcheckUK” during the broadcast, offering commentary on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s statements and retweeting messages supporting Boris Johnson.</p>
      <p>The @CCHQpress account is verified by Twitter, displaying a blue tick which is intended to denote that a user is genuine.</p>

      <p>In response, Twitter has warned that rules are in place on the platform which prohibit behaviour that misleads the public.</p>
      <p>“Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK General Election. We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts,” a spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>“Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information – in a manner seen during the UK election debate – will result in decisive corrective action.”</p>
      <p>Twitter has been bolstering its efforts to block misleading information during the election campaign after earlier this month launching a new tool to enable people to report deliberately misleading details about the voting process.</p>
      <p>The platform has also announced a ban on political adverts.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party came under fire after the move on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Twitter display name was changed back to CCHQ Press shortly after the debate ended.</p>
      <p>The UK’s library and information association – CILIP – on Wednesday submitted a complaint to the Conservative Party over the issue.</p>
      <aside>Your party’s actions in misrepresenting itself as a legitimate fact checking service cross a line which ought never to be crossed<cite>CILIP chief executive Nick Poole</cite></aside>
      <p>In the letter, CILIP chief executive Nick Poole said the party crossed a line “which ought never to be crossed”.</p>
      <p>“Your party’s actions in misrepresenting itself as a legitimate fact checking service cross a line which ought never to be crossed – raising the spectre of state-sponsored misinformation and the deliberate undermining of truth and accountability which should have no place in British politics,” Mr Poole said.</p>
      <p>He added that the party’s communication and leadership team breached its own code of conduct and called for an investigation to be launched.</p>
      <p>Mr Poole warned that if the party failed to investigate, CILIP would take the matter to the Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>The move was also criticised by independent fact-checking charity Full Fact, which tweeted: “It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account ‘factcheckUK’ during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service such as @FullFact, @FactCheck or @FactCheckNI.”</p>
      <p>Some other Twitter users changed their display names to factcheckUK and posted critical comments about Mr Johnson while others changed their display name to CCHQ Press Office.</p>
