      <p>Asian shares lumbered lower on Wednesday as the Sino-U.S. trade talks produced nothing but a stream of conflicting messages, while concerns about a glut of supply saw oil prices suffer their biggest spill in seven weeks.</p>
      <p>SYDNEY: Asian shares stumbled on Wednesday as the Sino-U.S. trade talks produced nothing but a stream of conflicting messages, while concerns about a glut of supply left oil prices nursing their biggest one-day loss in seven weeks.</p>
      <p>Figures from the American Petroleum Institute out late Tuesday showed a far larger rise in crude stocks than expected. That followed reports Russia was unlikely to deepen its cuts to crude output.</p>

      <p>Brent crude futures eased another 5 cents to US$60.86 a barrel, after sliding 2.6per cent overnight, while U.S. crude recouped a slight 8 cents to US$55.29.</p>
      <p>The mood in share markets was subdued with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off 0.7per cent. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.8per cent and Shanghai blue chips 0.3per cent.</p>
      <p>E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 shed 0.26per cent and EUROSTOXX 50 futures 0.2per cent.</p>
      <p>The prospect for progress on trade seemed to dim when China condemned a U.S. Senate measure on Hong Kong, vowing to take the steps necessary to safeguard its sovereignty and security.</p>
      <p>The Senate unanimously passed legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Late Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump had threatened to raise tariffs further if China would not agree to a deal that he liked.</p>
      <p>The aggressive tone unsettled Wall Street and the Dow ended down 0.36per cent, while the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.06per cent and the Nasdaq added 0.24per cent.</p>
      <p>Dour forecasts from retailers Home Depot and Kohl's fueled worries about consumer spending, while the energy sector was the S&amp;P's biggest loser as oil slid.</p>
      <p>COUNTING DOWN TO FED MINUTES</p>
      <p>"The immediate focus remains on the U.S.-China trade talks, and markets seem reluctant to move much in either direction until they are resolved," wrote analysts at ANZ in a note.</p>
      <p>"It was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable, suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook."</p>
      <p>Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries dropped further to a two-week trough of 1.75per cent, with a marked flattening of the curve hinting at a possible return of recession fears.</p>
      <p>The dip in yields nudged the dollar down on the safe-haven Japanese yen and it was last at 108.47 , though still within the 107.87 to 109.48 range of the last five weeks.</p>
      <p>The euro held at US$1.1070 and faced chart resistance around US$1.1090. The dollar was steadier on a basket of currencies at 97.901 .</p>
      <p>Investors are now awaiting minutes of the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting where it cut interest rates and signaled a pause for the time being.</p>
      <p>"The minutes will elaborate on the Fed's view that the downside risks to the U.S. economy have eased, and that a "material reassessment" of the economic outlook will be needed for it to cut rates again," said Joseph Capurso, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>
      <p>"We see the FOMC now on hold until March, 2020."</p>
      <p>The market has all but given up on the prospect of an easing in December, which is now priced at just 0.8per cent. A move in March is put at a probability of around 42per cent.</p>
      <p>The risk-off tone left spot gold a shade firmer at US$1,473.73 per ounce .</p>
