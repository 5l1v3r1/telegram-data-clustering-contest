      <h1>Harry Kane breaks silence on Mauricio Pochettino axe as Tottenham bring in Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been appointed as Mauricio Pochettino's replacement, agreeing a three-and-a-half year deal in north London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:21:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane has sent an emotional message to Mauricio Pochettino following his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> axe.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked by Spurs on Tuesday night after a disappointing start to the Premier League season.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been confirmed as his replacement, agreeing a three-and-a-half year deal in north London.</p>
      <p>England captain Kane is among those players to flourish under Pochettino, following his appointment in 2014.</p>
      <p>The Spurs striker posted on social media: "Gaffer. I’ll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams.</p>

      <p>We’ve had some amazing moments in the last 5 and a half years that I will never forget.</p>
      <p>"You were my manager but my friend as well and I thank you for that relationship.</p>
      <p>"Good luck with your next chapter!</p>
      <p>Kane follows Dele Alli, who also sent his best to the departing Tottenham boss, who is sacked months after reaching the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “I can’t thank this man enough. He’s taught me so much and I’m so grateful for everything he’s done for me."</p>

      <p>Ben Davies also paid tribute to Pochettino following Wales' victory over Hungary.</p>
      <p>The Tottenham left-back only found out about his exit after the match after news broke during Wales' 2-0 victory.</p>
      <p>"It was a big shock. He has been amazing to work with for the last five years and it is a shame to see him go."</p>
      <p>Mourinho's first match in charge of Spurs will be a London derby against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p>The new Spurs boss also faces a trip to former club <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at Old Trafford in his first month in the job.</p>
