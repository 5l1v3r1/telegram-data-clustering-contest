      <h3>Erling Braut Haaland’s father has been spotted at Manchester United’s training ground amid Manchester United’s interest in the Red Bull Salzburg striker, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p>Website <i>The Athletic</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://theathletic.com/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/">Metro</a>, is reporting that former Manchester City midfielder Alfe Inge Haaland was seen at Carrington training ground.</p>
      <p>The same article states that Alfe was seen at Manchester United after the retired Norway international insisted he wouldn’t stand in his son’s way of a move to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, Haaland’s agent Mino Raiola could prove a sticking point given his difficult relationship with the 20-time English champions.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to add that Manchester United would be open to reaching an agreement in the January transfer window before loaning Haaland back to Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
      <p>Manchester United supporters will remember Alfe Inge Haaland’s clash with Roy Keane on two separate occasions in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils are thought to be in the market to sign a new striker after they sold Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>Haaland has scored 15 times and has made four assists in 12 games in the Austrian Premier League so far this season.</p>
      <p>The teenager has also netted seven times in four Champions League games, including a goal against Liverpool FC.</p>
