      <p>The NATO leaders will discuss Afghanistan mission among other issues in NATO Leaders summit in London next month.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters ahead of NATO foreign ministers meeting on Tuesday, Stoltenberg said the NATO leaders will discuss a range of issues during the London summit including NATO’s role in the fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p>Stoltenberg further added “Our training missions in Afghanistan and Iraq continue to play an important role in preventing the resurgence of ISIS and other terrorist groups.”</p>
      <p>Responding to a question regarding the potential threats the allies face, Stoltenberg described the Afghanistan mission as the alliance’s biggest military operation aimed at fighting terrorism and making sure Afghanistan does not once again become a safe haven for international terrorism.</p>
      <p>“And we also agree on the need to make sure that we recognize the importance of standing together in avoiding that ISIS is able to get a foothold in Afghanistan, which is their declared aim,” he added.</p>
      <p>This comes as the Afghan forces, backed by coalition forces, have stepped up operations against ISIS militants in Nangarhar province during the recent months.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of ISIS militants and their family members surrendered to the Afghan forces in Nangarhar province during the recent weeks amid growing pressures from the security forces.</p>
