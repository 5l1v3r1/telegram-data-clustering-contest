      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> previously suggested he would have sold <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Christian_Eriksen">Christian Eriksen</a> due to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> midfielder’s desire to leave the club.</p>
      <p>The new Spurs boss has replaced Mauricio Pochettino <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mourinho-spurs-manager-jose-tottenham-pochettino-levy-sacked-a9210066.html">after the Argentine was sacked on Monday.</a></p>
      <p>And the Portuguese recently discussed how he would have dealt with the situation if he was in charge, with Eriksen now set to walk on a free next summer.</p>
      <p>“I don’t like to keep players that don’t want to stay at the club,” Mourinho admitted.</p>
      <p>“I think it is always really difficult. I am not thinking about the economical perspective, I mean from a motivational point of view.</p>
      <p>“We sold Robben to Real Madrid, Chelsea didn’t want to or need the money. But he didn’t want to be there and wanted to go.</p>
      <p>“There are some moments where motivation affects performance and it is difficult to keep players happy when they have other dreams.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho will manage his first game as Spurs boss on Saturday against West Ham with the side currently sat in 14th in the table.</p>
