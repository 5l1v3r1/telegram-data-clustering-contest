      <p><b>HANOI, VietnamÂ (AP)</b> - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper says the United States is providing Vietnam with a surplus American ship for its coast guard.</p>
      <p>Esper made the announcement during a speech Wednesday at the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, a government university in Hanoi. He said it would be provided next year, but he gave no details on payment or exact timing.</p>
      <p>Esper also was meeting in Hanoi with senior Vietnamese government officials. It is his first visit to the country since becoming defense secretary in July.</p>
      <p>Vietnam is one of the most vocal critics of China's sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea and has accused Beijing of encroaching into its waters.</p>
