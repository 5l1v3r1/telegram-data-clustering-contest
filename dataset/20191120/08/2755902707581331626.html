      <p>The ongoing strike by nurses and doctors in Zimbabwe have left many expecting mothers stranded. Most of these <b><a href="https://iharare.com/here-are-the-cheapest-private-hospital-charges-for-pregnant-women-in-harare/">pregnant mothers cannot afford the high fees being charged by private hospitals and clinics</a></b> that they have now turned to informal midwives.</p>
      <p>One of these midwives is<b><a href="https://iharare.com/mbare-gogo-who-delivered-100-babies/"> Gogo Esther Gwena from Mbare who delivered well over 100 babies in a single week</a></b>. Gogo Esther Gwena who is a midwife with St Johns Apostolic Church of the Whole World, stays only a few meters from the council-run Edith Opperman Clinic. However, since the clinic is still closed, Gogo Gwena’s apartment has become the defacto “maternity ward” for many expecting mothers who cannot afford private health care.</p>
      <p>Below are pictures from Gogo Gwena’s ‘maternity ward’</p>

      <p>Gogo Gwena’s selfless desire to help others must be applauded but at the same time, the authorities must make sure that she is supplied with the resources and medications to allow her to help her community better.  First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa visited Gogo Gwena after learning of her selfless acts and donated foodstuffs and other basic commodities.</p>
      <p>Zimbabweans have called on Gogo Gwena to be fully capacitated so that she temporarily fill the gap which has been left by the striking nurses under sanitary conditions which pose no dangers to either her or her many patients.</p>
