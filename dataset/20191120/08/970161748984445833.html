      <p>It’s now what we believe is scientifically referred to as ‘really bloody cold’.</p>
      <p>Thus you may have gone out to your car this morning and spotted a load of ice and frost clogging up your windows.</p>
      <p>You could try the sandwich bag hack or go at it with a special scraper, but if you’re looking for another quick and easy way to clear ice from your windows, you’re in luck.</p>
      <p>A woman has shared a ‘genius’ trick to clear car windows, using an old bottle of carpet stain remover.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>You see, certain carpet stain removers have bottles with a special brush attachment to help you massage the cleaning product into fabric.</p>
      <p>It turns out that brush attachment also works as a gentle ice scraper.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/angela.hickling.967/videos/pcb.1207603269430012/1207602932763379/?type=3&amp;theater&amp;ifg=1">Angela Hickling shared her wisdom on Facebook</a>, explaining that she filled an emptied out Dr Beckmann carpet cleaner bottle with warm water, then dragged the brush over her car’s windows.</p>
      <p>The warm water comes out through the brush and is spread evenly, quickly melting and wiping away ice. Smart, right?</p>
      <p>Just make sure you use <i>warm</i> water rather than boiling water straight out of the kettle, otherwise you’re risking the glass cracking.</p>
      <p>Obviously, this hack requires that you happen to have a carpet stain remover bottle with a brush attachment just lying around, otherwise you’ll need to shell out £2.80 for a bottle – only to immediately empty it out.</p>
      <p>FYI, you can just buy an actual ice scraper for the same price or cheaper. Or just spray your windows with warm water then use a cloth to wipe away.</p>
      <p>Despite all those caveats, the trick has still been hailed online, with Angela’s post being shared more than 17,000 times.</p>
