      <h4>Since launching in 2018 campaigns have delivered increases of an average of up to 30% for over 50 tourism boards globally. Tourism Boards benefit from accessing 60,000+ B2B travel partners, together making 1.5 billion hotel searches daily via Hotelbeds.</h4>
      <p>PALMA, SPAIN - Hotelbeds has confirmed the successful launch of an industry-first B2B service for destination marketing organizations (DMOs) globally to drive incremental tourism arrivals. </p>
      <p>Leveraging the company’s technology, booking platform, and relationships with hoteliers and B2B travel buyers globally, Hotelbeds has to date already worked with over 50 tourism boards from around the world.</p>
      <p>The result has been to increase room nights for target destinations by up to 30% on average – plus improving revenue performance – by attracting additional low- and shoulder-season visitors from international and domestic source markets globally.</p>
      <p>Partner destinations receive access to the over 60,000 B2B travel trade buyers – such as retail travel agents, tour operators, airlines, and points redemption clients – who together make over 1.5 billion accommodation searches per day via Hotelbeds.</p>
      <p>Due to the international reach of Hotelbeds – present in over 140 source markets globally, with the fast-growing Chinese market already the fourth biggest globally for the company – destination partners also benefit from receiving more international and long-haul arrivals. Bookings from international and long-haul source markets  in turn deliver high-value customers who spend more in destination, stay longer, cancel less, return more often and book farther out than typical direct to consumer customer profiles (which tend to be highly domestic).</p>
      <p><b>Gareth Matthews</b>, Director of Marketing &amp; Communications at Hotelbeds, stated: “<i>Our whole purpose as a travel distributor is to drive incremental high-value bookings for hotels from non-competing, hard to reach B2B travel trade sources such as retail travel agents and tour operators. So we thought why not also do the same for destinations? No one else is offering destination marketing boards such a comprehensive set of opportunities that allows them to easily access the distribution power of the world’s travel trade.  We launched the service at a global level last year and I/m pleased to confirm that our knowledge, experience and infrastructure is already delivering, on average, increases in incoming visitor paxes of 30% for our destination partners.</i>”</p>
      <p><b>Joseph Sheller</b>, Head of Destination Marketing, commented, “<i>I am proud to say that our Hotelbeds Destination Marketing service is in high demand on a global level. We pride ourselves on delivering highly tangible ROI for our partners and measure our success by the incremental year-over-year increase in room nights/PAX produced by the campaigns, as well as the total overall economic impact.  What destination doesn/t want incremental visitors that also stay longer and spend more, especially during the low- and shoulder-seasons? As the first B2B travel distributor to launch this service, we are truly revolutionizing the landscape of destination marketing!</i>”</p>
