      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">GBP/USD</a></b> remains capped by the psychological resistance at 1.3000 and the recent high at 1.3013. Directly above here we have the 200 week ma at 1.3116, the 50% retracement of the move down from 2018 at 1.3167, the 5 year downtrend at 1.3185 and the 1.3187 May high and these remain our short term targets, this is TOUGH <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> and we look for the market to fail here. Above here lies 1.3382 the 2019 high”.</p>
      <p>“It remains immediately bid above the 1.2764/ 23.6% retracement. Failure at 1.2764 will see a slide to the 200 day ma at 1.2703. This guards 1.2582 (September high). Below 1.2582 lies the 1.2466 uptrend. The uptrend guards 1.2196/94”.</p>
