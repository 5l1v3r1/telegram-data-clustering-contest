      <p>Brad McQuaid, the legendary game designer behind the MMORPG EverQuest, passed away at 51 in his home. <a href="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/content/forums/topic/11315/with-deepest-regrets-aradune-has-passed-away">The news has been relayed by the folks at Visionary Realms</a>, the development team he had helped found a few years ago.</p>
      <blockquote>It is with deep regret and profound sadness that we share that Brad McQuaid, Chief Creative Officer of Visionary Realms passed away in his home last night.<br/>Brad was a visionary, a mentor, an artist, a trailblazer, a friend, a husband, a father. He touched thousands of lives with his dreams and concepts. He changed the landscape of video games forever. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered in life and in Pantheon.<br/>Thank you, Brad, for bringing us together through your worlds. Rest in peace, Aradune.<br/>All of us at Visionary Realms offer our deepest condolences to Brad’s family and during this most difficult time, we kindly ask that you respect the privacy of Brad’s family.</blockquote>
      <p>Beyond EverQuest, Brad McQuaid also spearheaded the creation of the MMORPG Vanguard: Saga of Heroes (released in 2007). At Visionary Realms, he was working on Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, a PC MMORPG that aims to recreate the feeling of those old-school massively multiplayer online games McQuaid had helped define.</p>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1588672538/pantheon-rise-of-the-fallen?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Pantheon%3A%20Rise%20of%20the%20Fallen">an unsuccessful Kickstarter campaign attempted in early 2014</a>, Visionary Realms slowly continued development, the game's funding a mixture of pledges (<a href="https://www.pantheonmmo.com/join/">through the official website</a>) and angel investors. Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen, made with Unity, is currently in Pre-Alpha testing.</p>
      <p>The official EverQuest Twitter account offered condolences to the family of Brad McQuaid, and so did many others, including former Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley.</p>

      <p>It has indeed been an awful week for former EverQuest and Vanguard developers (and fans), as Matt McDonald, an artist and animator who had worked on both those MMO games, <a href="https://twitter.com/j_smedley/status/1196445149867307009">also passed away</a>. He was now working as Technical Art Director at Amazon Game Studios.</p>
      <p>We offer our deepest condolences and sympathies to all the families and friends involved with their losses.</p>
