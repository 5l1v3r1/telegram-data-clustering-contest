      <p><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Haven-assets">Haven assets</a> are rallying in Asia as <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/US-China-trade">US-China trade</a> tensions take a turn for the worse, ending weeks of optimism that a deal between the two countries was close enough to touch.</p>
      <p>Developed-nation bonds in the region extended recent gains Wednesday, with yields on 10-year Treasuries sinking almost 20 basis points in the past two weeks. Australia’s have fallen even more. The Aussie dollar, a proxy to China’s economy due to the two nations’ close trade ties, has dropped versus all its Group-of-10 peers in November, while stocks have fallen from recent highs.</p>
      <p>“Markets have been guilty for around 20 months of underestimating the risks of a trade deal being done at all,” said Stephen Miller, an adviser in Sydney at GSFM, a unit of Canada’s CI Financial Group. “Whether it’s Treasuries or stocks or currencies, investors are now repositioning their bets in case we see political dysfunctions persist and reach a tipping point that spills over to trade.”</p>
      <p>The haven trade in the region gathered pace after the US Senate on Tuesday unanimously passed a bill aimed at supporting Hong Kong protesters, spurring China to repeat a threat to retaliate. It would be difficult for the US to sign a deal if the demonstrations in Hong Kong are met with violence, US Vice President Mike Pence said earlier this week.</p>

      <p>Investors have been here before. The US and China were said to be close to sealing a deal about six months ago, only for the US to claim the Asian nation backed away from verbal commitments when the time came to sign the agreement.</p>
      <p>“The market reaction could be much more negative if a repeat of May happens,” said Eugene Leow, a fixed-income strategist in DBS Bank in Singapore. Tensions in Hong Kong are also adding “another element of risk at a time when China-US trade talks enter the crucial last stage,” he said.</p>
      <p>Here are a range of market moves showing investors’ risk-off mood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treasury 10-year yields dropped as much as 4 basis points Wednesday to a two-week low of 1.74%</li>
        <li>Australia’s 10-year yield declined 5 basis points to 1.07%</li>
        <li>South Korea’s won, often viewed as a proxy for global trade, slipped 0.2%, extending this month’s decline to 0.6%</li>
        <li>A JPMorgan gauge of demand for emerging-market currencies has fallen for a second week</li>
        <li>The VIX Index, a measure of expected volatility in US stocks, has risen more than 6% this week</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“The market mood is definitely shifting,” said Prashant Newnaha, senior strategist at TD Securities in Singapore. “There are a lot of questions on where this deal is sitting at the moment, and developments we’ve had in May are now putting some doubts on whether a deal can be signed at all.”</p>
