      <p>In the clip, the duo are seen getting hair and make-up done, as they get ready to attend the Ryan Gordy Foundation 60 Years of Motown celebration at the Waldorf Astoria in Beverly Hills, California last week.</p>
      <p>“This is my second dress and I feel like a princess. I never actually went to prom. I skipped it to go see Metallica, so this feels nice. I would want my prom dress to look like this,” she said in the clip, shared on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Her sibling also approved of the look, adding: “Tinker Belly! Very nice, very nice – pretty.”</p>
      <p>For the event, the two coordinated their looks, with Paris donning a white gown embroidered with silver gems and Prince opting for a black tuxedo bedazzled with similar jewels.</p>
      <p>Honouring her brother and “best friend” in the caption of the clip, the star added, “thank you @voguemagazine, had such a lovely time.”</p>
