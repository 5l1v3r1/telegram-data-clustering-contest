      <p>“DBX also marks a key moment in the delivery of the third and final phase of our Second Century Plan, not only representing the promised expansion of our portfolio but also signaling the start of production at Aston Martin’s second manufacturing plant.</p>
      <p>"We have both delivered this model through our expertise, but also by garnering invaluable experience and knowledge from external counsel, including our Female Advisory Board.</p>
      <p>“This is a real landmark for this great British brand and I promise that DBX will reward all who experience it in their everyday lives.”</p>

      <p>Three years ago Aston Martin took over a 90-acre site in St Athan, which included three ‘super hangars’, from the Ministry of Defence. The hangars have now been converted and the factory has already produced a number of DBX testing vehicles.</p>
