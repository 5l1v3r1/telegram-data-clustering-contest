      <h1>The Greg Taylor touch of class as Celtic star protects mascot from the big Hampden freeze</h1>
      <h2>The left-back had a fine evening as Steve Clarke's side defeated Kazakhstan on Tuesday night.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:10:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:10</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>The absence of Andy Robertson and Kieran Tierney has been to undoubted benefit of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greg-taylor">Greg Taylor</a>.</p>
      <p>While the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> left-back wouldn't wish injury upon either of his international team-mates, it's allowed him to show what he's all about.</p>
      <p>Not that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> needs convincing, having worked with Taylor extensively at Kilmarnock.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old produced a fine display in the 2-1 win over Kazakhstan, bagging an assist for John McGinn's second.</p>
      <p>But it was before kick-off he displayed a real touch of class.</p>
      <p>On a freezing night at Hampden, mascots were left shivering as they lined up with the team for the national anthem.</p>
      <p>One youngster looked particularly baltic and it didn't go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Taylor promptly removed his tracksuit top and passed it on to the delighted kid.</p>

      <p>Having hardly featured under Neil Lennon since a summer move to Parkhead, Taylor is grateful for the minutes with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a>.</p>
      <p>And he hopes he's done enough to remain in Clarke's thoughts even when Premier League stars Tierney and Robertson return.</p>
      <p>He said earlier this week: "In football, it's about taking opportunities and, when you least expect it, you get them.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"Hopefully I've done enough to keep my place and, beyond that, we all know it's down to the gaffer.</p>
      <p>"You keep a good base fitness - it's important to do that regardless if you're playing or not. I played against St Mirren a couple of weeks back, so it wasn't all that long ago that I played.</p>
      <p>"I know obviously it's not been ideal - not playing as much as I'd have liked - but you've just got to be patient. It's a massive team I'm at."</p>
