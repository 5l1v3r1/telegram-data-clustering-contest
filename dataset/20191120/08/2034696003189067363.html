        <b>Erm, there's just one small problem here...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Julia Roberts was originally the first choice to play Harriet Tubman in a biopic of the legendary abolitionist, despite it requiring her to play blackface.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Erivo is currently generating Oscar buzz for her role as Tubman in Kasi Lemons’ biopic Harriet – which tells the incredible story of how she escaped slavery and went on to free others using the Underground Railway network of safe houses.</p>
      <p>But in an unlikely twist to the film’s casting, it’s been revealed that Oscar winner Julia was actually the first name considered to tackle the iconic role.</p>
      <p>Gregory Allen, the screenwriter and producer of Harriet, revealed the preference in a <a href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/interview_screenwriter_gregory-allen-howard">new Q&amp;A with Focus Features earlier this month.</a></p>

      <p>Describing how he began work on the script in 1994, he said: “I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, ‘This script is fantastic. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman’.</p>
      <p>Things got even more complicated when someone pointed out that Roberts wasn’t exactly the ideal fit for the role.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Allen explained: “When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn’t be Harriet, the executive responded, ‘It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference’.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to NME earlier this month, Erivo also addressed the backlash she faced in the role, after US critics argued that a British actress shouldn’t play the role of Tubman.</p>
      <p>“I’m never gonna say that anyone’s opinion is invalid,” Erivo said.</p>
      <p>“If that’s how people feel then that’s how people feel. It is my responsibility to make sure I do my job so that if these people do end up watching it they can be pleasantly surprised.”</p>
