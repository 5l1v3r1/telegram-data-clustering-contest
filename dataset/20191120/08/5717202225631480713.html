      <h1>Manchester United fans think Mason Greenwood is better than Rhian Brewster</h1>
      <h2>Mason Greenwood scored shortly after coming on.</h2>

      <p>The debate about Rhian Brewster and Mason Greenwood continued last night.</p>
      <p>England U21s had an away friendly against the Netherlands U21 team. Brewster was given the nod to start and Greenwood replaced him in the second half. With Eddie Nketiah out injured, it was a straight battle between the Liverpool and Manchester United starlets for the starting striker spot.</p>
      <p>Brewster played for most of the game but was unable to get on the scoresheet. Man United fans feel they have perfect evidence for their Greenwood case as he came off the bench to net a goal.</p>
      <p>Manchester City wonderkid Phil Foden floated a lovely ball over the top which Greenwood chased down. A bit of indecisiveness at the back allowed Greenwood to slot the ball in at the near post.</p>

      <p>Greenwood has enjoyed an impressive start to the season. The 18-year-old has already scored three senior goals for the Red Devils. He is still waiting for his first Premier League goal but fans feel it will come soon.</p>
      <p>Liverpool striker Brewster has not enjoyed as much success. Due to injuries, he has been limited to a couple of cup outings. He is highly-rated by the Reds but here are some Man United fans using the Greenwood goal for the U21s to show why he is better.</p>
