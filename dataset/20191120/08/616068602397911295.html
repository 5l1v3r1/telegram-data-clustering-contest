      <p>Castanet reader Bryan Cramer got a taste of the wild kingdom in his neighbourhood this week, "took this video a few days ago of 2 bucks fighting it out on Clifton Rd &amp; Boppart - had their little dispute &amp; went their separate ways uninjured."</p>
      <p>You can see near the end of the video a truck moving towards the pair but they were so engrossed in their duel that they completely ignored the truck even when it started honking the horn at them.</p>
      <p>This is a perfect example of how deer act during mating season also known as the rut. Mating season in deer is triggered by diminishing daylight which brings on behavioral and physiological changes that lead to breeding.</p>
