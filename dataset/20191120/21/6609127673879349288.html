        <b>A MINISTER has urged cops to probe whether the scumbag who supplied the ecstasy that killed teen Chelsea Bruce is still dealing from jail.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rev Brian Casey called for police to act after we revealed caged <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4973044/paisley-drugs-lewis-reid-snapchat-chelsea-bruce-death/">Lewis Reid’s</a> Twitter and Snapchat continues to tout cocaine for £80 a gram.</p>

      <p>The clergyman, who led the funeral of tragic Chelsea, 16, at Springburn Parish Church in Glasgow, said: “The police need to investigate. It’s worrying.</p>
      <p>"More focus should be put on the dealers than the addicts — it would be far more productive.</p>
      <p>"Drugs are a massive problem in our area.”</p>
      <p>We told how a pal of Reid, from Paisley, is thought to be running his 'Gucci' social media but it’s not known if he too is involved.</p>

      <p>A message posted this week read: “Prop their £80 a gram. More weights call number if need about Glasgow/Pollok/Paisley all night. Save number.”</p>
      <p>And a message on Twitter from Reid, of Paisley, advertises the Snapchat account and offers “1g for 40, 2 for 70, 3 for 100, 2g of prop £140.”</p>
      <p>He even mocked cops with a crude “F*** the CID” spelled out in white powder.</p>
