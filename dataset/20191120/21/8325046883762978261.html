      <p>After its successful debut on Gmail last year, Google is bringing its ghost-like Smart Compose feature to Google Docs.</p>
      <p>The company announced Wednesday that it would be expanding its AI-powered feature to Google Docs, allowing G-suite users to draft documents such as business contracts or marketing pitches quickly.</p>
      <p>Google says the feature has already saved people from typing more than 2 billion characters every week.</p>
      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-gmail-gets-smart-compose-automatic-reply-suggestion-service-2018-5">Google introduced Smart Compose on Gmail</a>, where light-grey auto-completed suggestions appear as users begin to type. Phrases are suggested based on context, like “Have a great weekend!” when signing off an email on a Friday. It also minimizes spelling and grammar errors.</p>
      <p>When it was introduced, the feature provoked <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-smart-compose-what-is-it-how-to-turn-it-off-2018-10">a flurry of responses</a> ranging from enthusiasm to concern.</p>
      <p>Smart Compose builds on another AI-powered reply service that got its start on Gmail, Smart Reply. The smartphone-geared feature suggests a few short responses, like “Sounds good!” at the bottom of the Compose window, based off emails sent before.</p>
      <p>For the time being, Smart Compose for Google Docs appears to be geared toward businesses. The beta version of the feature is currently only available to domain administrators, <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/smartcomposeindocsbeta/">the company said</a>.</p>
