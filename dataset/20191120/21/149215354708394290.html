      <p>Democrats might want to shield their eyes from the <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2019/11/20/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-shifts-in-wisconsin-public-opinion-favorable-to-president-trump-on-impeachment-and-presidential-election-preferences/">latest poll</a> from Marquette Law School released Wednesday.</p>
      <p>President Trump was shown leading all four of the party's top primary contenders — former Vice President Joe Biden; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — in head-to-head matchups in Wisconsin, which many analysts regard as <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/862863/wisconsin-might-most-important-state-2020-new-poll-biden-defeating-trump-by-9-points-there">one of the most important states</a> in the 2020 election.

      <p>Of course, like all polls there's probably not any reason for Democrats to panic, just as there was no reason for Republicans to worry too much about the October survey. With the exception of Buttigieg again, Trump's leads are all either within in or nearly within the poll's margin of error or 4.1 percentage points.</p>
      <p>Biden, meanwhile, <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2019/11/20/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-shifts-in-wisconsin-public-opinion-favorable">was leading</a> the Democratic field among Wisconsin voters with 30 percent of the vote, followed by Sanders at 17 percent, Warren at 15 percent, and Buttigieg at 13 percent.</p>
      <p>The Marquette Law School poll was conducted between Nov. 13-17. The sample consisted of 801 registered Wisconsin voters who were interviewed over the phone. The margin of error was 4.1 percentage points.
