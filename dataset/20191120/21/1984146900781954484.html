      <h1>Nadine Coyle describes reports of rift with Cheryl as 'fake news' on I'm A Celebrity</h1>
      <h2>Nadine Coyle discussed her relationship with her Girls Aloud bandmate in a chat with fellow campmate Jacqueline Jossa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:33:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:33</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Dickinson</a></address>
      <p>Nadine Coyle has rubbished claims she did not get on with her Girls Aloud bandmate <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cheryl">Cheryl</a> , calling it "fake news".</p>
      <p>The group split in 2013 amid rumours of feuds and in-fighting, and the Irish singer recently admitted that she had not really spoken with her bandmates since then, with the exception of Sarah Harding.</p>
      <p>However, opening up to fellow campmate Jacqueline Jossa on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">Iâ€™m A Celebrity</a> ... Get Me Out Of Here!, Coyle said rumours about her relationship with Cheryl were not accurate.</p>
      <p>As they were sat by the creek, Jossa asked Coyle if she got on with everyone in the group, and she replied: "Yes."</p>
      <p>The actress said she had heard that Coyle did not get on with Cheryl, and she responded: "Fake news."</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud - made up of Coyle, Cheryl, Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh - was created during TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>
      <p>Coyle said being in the group had been "really good".</p>
      <p>She said: "I like being in a girl band. I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I'm used to being around girls."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
