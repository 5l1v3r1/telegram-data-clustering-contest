        <li>A stuffy nose occurs when some of the blood vessels and natural tissues in your nose, called the mucous membrane, are inflamed.</li>
        <li>To get rid of that stuffy feeling, all you need to do is reduce the inflammation.</li>
        <li>There are several natural home remedies and over-the-counter medicines that can help reduce inflammation and relieve congestion.</li>

          <b>This article was reviewed by <a href="https://www.upmc.com/media/experts/graham-snyder">Graham Snyder</a>, MD, MS, who is the medical director for the Infection Prevention and Hospital Epidemiology branch at the <a href="https://www.upmc.com/">University of Pittsburgh Medical Center</a>.</b>

      <p>Nasal congestion is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866558/">one of the most frequent symptoms</a> that primary-care and specialist clinics hear from their patients.</p>
      <h3>What causes a stuffy nose</h3>
      <p>The main reasons could be an illness like the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/common-cold">cold</a> or <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/flu">flu</a>. Or it could be allergies, traffic smoke, or even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999828/">pregnancy</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/common-cold">Cold</a> and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/flu">flu</a></b>: When you have a viral infection like the cold or flu, your sinuses produce mucus to help the virus drain out, says <a href="https://drdina.ca/">Dina Kulik</a>, MD, an assistant professor in the department of pediatrics at the University of Toronto.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/allergies"><b>Allergies</b></a>: When you have allergies, the body releases a chemical called histamine, which is what triggers inflammation in your nasal passage, clogging it up.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/pregnancy">Pregnancy</a></b>: An estimated <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2999828/">30%</a> of pregnant women suffer from significant nasal problems, which are often the result of an increase in pregnancy-related hormones that tamper with the nasal tissue and blood flow in the nose and can cause a number of symptoms including a stuffy nose.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regardless of the cause, a stuffy nose almost always comes down to the same problem: Some of the blood vessels and natural tissues in your nose, called the mucous membrane, are inflamed, which is what’s blocking your airway and causing congestion.</p>
      <p>To get rid of that stuffy feeling, all you need to do is reduce the inflammation. And there are several ways to achieve that, from natural home remedies to over-the-counter medicines.</p>
      <h3>How to clear a stuffy nose</h3>
      <p>If your stuffy nose is from the cold, flu, or some other common infection, your go-to remedies are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Humid air</b>: First, if you’re at home with no medicine in your cabinet, try a steamy shower or humidifier. “The moisture in the air from a shower or humidifier acts to soothe the irritation in the nose and sinuses, helping release mucus,” Kulik says.</li>
        <li><b>Decongestants:</b> But if you’re shopping for the over-the-counter treatments, decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine, will reduce the tissue swelling and may help offer congestion relief.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If allergies are the cause for your discomfort, antihistamines and intranasal corticosteroids can help. But be careful because some types of antihistamines can cause drowsiness.</p>
      <p>If it’s something else causing your stuffy nose, Kulik suggests saline sprays for quick, easy relief. If you’re using a saline spray on your infant, parents will need to use an aspirator or nasal bulb to remove any remaining mucus.</p>
      <p>There’s a chance that you could develop sinusitis. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/what_to_do_about_sinusitis">Sinusitis</a> is the medical term for congested facial sinuses. When sinusitis accompanies a head cold, it does not require antibiotics and is not usually a cause for concern. But when the inflammation lasts longer than a cold or is associated with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antibiotic-use/community/for-patients/common-illnesses/sinus-infection.html">serious symptoms</a>, you should see a doctor.</p>
