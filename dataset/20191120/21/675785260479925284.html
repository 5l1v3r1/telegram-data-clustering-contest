      <p>Haggard Ian Wright looks to be on the brink of quitting I'm A Celebrity after just four days.</p>
      <p>The football pundit made a worrying confession about his struggles with the lack of food during tonight's show.</p>
      <p>Presenter Dec Donnelly has frequently voiced his belief that the former Arsenal striker will be first to "crack" - and it seems he may be proved right.</p>
      <p>Rugby player James Haskell and comedian Andrew Maxwell voiced their concern for Ian's wellbeing during an intimate chat.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Ian said: "I don’t think it’s even been 5 days yet and I’m already struggling with the eating."</p>

      <p>Trying to build Ian's confidence, James said: "This isn’t about cakes and food, it’s about…"</p>
      <p>Interrupting the rugby star, competitive Ian suggested: "Survival".</p>
      <p>Giving some solid advice, James continued: "This is about fuelling your body so you can get through the day."</p>

      <p>Ian even claimed the lack of food took him back to some dark days under former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Ian said: "When Arsene Wenger first came to Arsenal we literally changed from eating what we wanted, to bland food.</p>
      <p>"It’s almost taking me back to remember how bland the food was."</p>

      <p>James told fellow sportsman Ian that he was approaching the food situation all wrong and insisted it’s just fuel.</p>
      <p>Still in the Bush Telegraph, Ian said: "James and Andrew have concern for me eating, it’s nice."</p>
      <p>James, Andrew and Ian all sang songs as they had a shower to try and build a positive vibe in camp.</p>

      <p>This came just hours after Dec predicted that we were close to an Ian meltdown.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Extra Camp on Tuesday night, the Geordie presenter said: "He might blow, he might just go."</p>
      <p>When Emily Atack admitted she felt sorry for Ian, Dec replied: "It's the food situation that is going to get him I think.</p>
      <p>"So let's see how they do in the trial, I think it could be a really fun trial actually. But I think he might just crack today."</p>
