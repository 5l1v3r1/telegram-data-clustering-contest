      <p>Vets have saved a nine month old puppy who suffered one of the ‘worst cases of anal prolapse ever seen’.</p>
      <p>French Bulldog Myles was close to death when he came into the care of animal shelter Hope Rescue in Llanharan, south Wales.</p>
      <p>‘Horrendous’ photos show he was ‘dangerously underweight’ and suffering from an ‘extremely serious’ case of anal prolapse – meaning his rectum was protruding out of his body.</p>
      <p>His condition was so bad that Myles, who also had ‘skin issues’, had to undergo a high risk operation immediately or be put down.</p>
      <p>Vanessa Waddon, founder and Transformation Manager of Hope Rescue, told Metro.co.uk staff waited with ‘baited breath’ as vets performed complex surgery to resect the prolapse.</p>
      <p>The risky procedure is often unsuccessful and can often result in dogs dying.</p>

      <p>After hours under the knife the dog shelter received the ‘good news’ that the operation was successful.</p>

      <p>He still has a low temperature, but the results of the surgery were as well as could be hoped for given the life or death odds, Ms Waddon said.</p>
      <p>Myles will now be moved into foster care while he undergoes ‘a long process of recovery’.</p>
      <p>Parasitic infections are the most common cause of rectal prolapse in dogs, but other causes include constipation and bladder inflammation. One of the photos of Myles was too graphic for<a href="https://metro.co.uk/"> Metro.co.uk</a> to publish.</p>
      <p>The animal charity said they could not reveal how Myles came into care while an investigation is on-going.</p>

      <p>However Ms Waddon said his condition was one of the ‘worst’ she had ever seen since establishing Hope Rescue in 2005.</p>
      <p>‘We only saw the photos of him as he went straight to the vet. We were not expecting it to be that bad’ she told metro.co.uk</p>
      <p>‘We see a lot of dogs in horrible conditions, we were not prepared for what we saw with Myles. He was incredibly underweight.</p>
      <p>‘It takes a lot to shock us, we have got a lot of dogs in out care. But everyone here was shocked about his condition.’</p>
      <p>Hope Rescue have set up a <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/lastchanceformyles">Just Giving Page for Myles</a> to raise funds for his treatment and recovery.</p>

      <p>A post about his plight on Facebook was met with hundreds of comments from well-wishers, some who even offered to foster the puppy while he gets better.</p>

      <p>One said: ‘Poor little angel, hope he pulls through. Thank you for giving him a chance, everything crossed for this little guy.’</p>
      <p>Another said: ‘That poor pup. Breaks my heart to see him like that. Hope he makes a full recovery from the surgery and gets to go to a very loving home</p>
      <p>Home rescue saves stray dogs who would otherwise be destroyed after spending seven days in a pound.</p>
      <p>They rehome dogs either by arranging for them to be adopted or partnering up with national centres such as Blue Cross and Dogs Trust.</p>
