      <p>Congressional candidate Nate McMurray should expect an earful when he appears Thursday evening before officials of the Erie County Democratic Committee.</p>
      <p>The largest contingent of the eight-county 27th Congressional District has yet to bestow its blessing on the Grand Island supervisor’s encore candidacy for the seat once held by Republican Chris Collins, even though all seven other party organizations have nominated him for the special election anticipated in early 2020.</p>
      <p>But Erie County, which controls 49% of the district’s weighted vote, appears to be tepidly approaching another McMurray candidacy after he narrowly lost to the now disgraced Collins in 2018. As McMurray prepares to “interview” with Erie County’s Democratic officials Thursday for the final piece of the nominating puzzle, insiders say he will hear a litany of complaints about the 2018 contest many think he should have won.</p>
      <p>“Nate assumed he will be the candidate because he ran the last time,” said one party source who asked not to be identified. “The way he ran his campaign the last time rubbed a lot of people the wrong way, and that may have cost him the election. That’s problematic.”</p>
      <p>Another party insider said real concern surrounds McMurray’s effect on “down ballot” candidates running on the Democratic ticket for local and state offices next year.</p>
      <p>“I think there are people concerned about what happens with a candidate who is lighting a fire every five minutes,” the source said. “If he is inflaming people in the ‘purple’ areas, does that affect conservative voters? How does that impact other candidates down the ballot?”</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, McMurray appears assured of the Democratic nod for a special election that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has hinted will occur on April 28 in conjunction with the state’s presidential primary. Indeed, backing from Democratic organizations in Niagara, Genesee, Orleans, Wyoming, Livingston, Ontario and Monroe counties gives McMurray 51% of the weighted vote and the majority he needs.</p>
      <p>Wyoming County Democratic Chairwoman Cynthia Appleton typified the ringing endorsements of other party leaders when she pointed to McMurray’s narrow loss and “magical” campaign last year.</p>
      <p>“He energized the rural counties. He created a movement on the ground that hasn’t gone away,” she said. “Nate asked them all to ‘fight like hell.’ They did, and will again.”</p>
      <p>Education advocate Melodie Baker is also exploring a Democratic candidacy, and is expected to appear before Erie County Democrats on Thursday. She was unavailable for comment Wednesday, and has not committed to competing in a June primary should she fail (as anticipated) to win the support of party leaders for the expected April special election.</p>

      <p>But if McMurray gets pushback from party leaders on Thursday, he may return his own fire – even as he considers Erie County friendly turf. He says “numbers don’t lie.”</p>
      <p>“We had the largest partisan swing for any first-time candidate in the country, and lost by less than half a percentage point,” he said of his 2018 contest and how much closer it was than Collins' 2016 landslide.</p>
      <p>He also noted the weighted vote majority supplied by the seven outlying counties that back him, as well as healthy attendance at his early campaign events.</p>
      <p>“The reality is that we’re very excited about where we are,” he said.</p>
      <p>Still, McMurray endured his share of criticism during the 2018 effort that he lost by 1,087 votes against an incumbent under federal indictment for insider trading. Critics noted his campaign employed four campaign managers and at least 17 consultants. People intimately familiar with McMurray’s effort said political pros came and left, sometimes voluntarily and sometimes not.</p>
      <p>The Buffalo News reported immediately after last year’s campaign that many staffers left frustrated with the candidate’s reluctance to raise money, stick to a schedule or take advice. McMurray himself acknowledged in an interview that he never settled on a team he trusted until the campaign’s final weeks.</p>
      <p>“The campaign suffered from a lack of professional help from the beginning,” a Buffalo-based political operative who asked to remain unidentified said then. “Nate is a great guy who pretty much ran his own campaign.”</p>
      <p>For the 2020 election, however, McMurray will need every possible advantage to compete in New York State’s most Republican congressional district. Several declared and potential Republicans are already staking out ultra-conservative positions far different from his that they believe will succeed in a district which polls show strongly supports President Trump.</p>
      <p>None of those GOP contenders are now handicapped by any federal indictment, as Collins was, and all are considered favorites in the deep red district.</p>
      <p>Still, McMurray remains confident about his chances because of name recognition and a positive legacy stemming from 2018.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been to hospitals, dairies, diners and every square inch of Western New York,” he said. “That’s why we’ve received this support, and made up everything else with enthusiasm.”</p>
      <p>But McMurray also said he will listen to Erie County Democrats and their criticisms.</p>
      <p>“Absolutely,” he said. “You can always learn and improve. I’m hoping we’ll find some synergies that are undeniable.”</p>
