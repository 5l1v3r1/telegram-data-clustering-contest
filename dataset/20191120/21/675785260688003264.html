      <h1>Caitlyn Jenner's post-surgery sex life after 'uncomfortable' intimacy with Kris Jenner</h1>
      <h2>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here star Caitlyn Jenner - who is now 'dating' Sophia Hutchins - said sex with her ex, Kris Jenner, was awkward</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Frances Kindon</a></address>
      <p>When Caitlyn and Kris Jenner tied the knot in 1991, their sex life was "good and frequent".</p>
      <p>But it wasn't long before the gender dysphoria issues that had plagued <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> star Caitlyn from the age of 10 resurfaced and put a dampener on their love-making.</p>
      <p>While their intimacy was always “imbued” with love, Cait - who was called Bruce before her transition - admitted the experience was an awkward one.</p>
      <p>"My attitude is no different than it was in high school: I'm just not entirely comfortable with it," she wrote in her autobiography, The Secrets of My Life.</p>

      <p>Indeed, before Kris, the Olympian had slept with just two other women - wives Chrystie Crownover and Linda Thompson.</p>
      <p>And after her 2015 transition started, she remained decidedly on the fence about whether she would sleep with men, women or both.</p>
      <p>"Of the most important things in my life, sex is beyond the bottom; it has been that way for a long time," she explained.</p>
      <p>“A future female companion? I think about that. A future female sexual companion? Not happening, at least for now, and perhaps not ever,” Caitlyn, 70, wrote in her memoirs.</p>

      <p>At the time, she hinted she may actually have been more open to meeting a man.</p>
      <p>“A future male sexual companion? I have never had the inclination. But maybe that attitude might possibly change if I have the Final Surgery," she continued.</p>
      <p>She was later linked to transgender actress Candis Cayne, with the pair reportedly spotted kissing at a salon (claims Cait denied) before the so-called 'Final Surgery' to remove her penis took place in 2017.</p>

      <p>“The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated," she wrote, insisting the body part was 'just a penis' that was of no 'use'.</p>
      <p>"I just want to have all the right parts. I am also tired of tucking the damn thing in all the time," joked the reality star, who also underwent a nose job, boob job, tracheal shave, jaw reshaping and beard removal as part of her transition.</p>
      <p>Then reports claimed she was dating transgender model Sophia Hutchins, 23.</p>
      <p>And in 2017, Caitlyn hinted that she was once again enjoying intimacy, telling The Times she'd previously been "no good" at sex because it meant “giving", adding, "[but] I believe I am better now."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Caitlyn and Sophie wasted no time moving in together and have spent the last two years jet-setting across the globe.</p>
      <p>Acknowledging their reported relationship, Caitlyn's step-daughter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> described Sophia as, "really sweet."</p>
      <p>"She’s younger, but she’s not bothering anyone. She’s super sweet," she said in a Divorce Sucks! podcast.</p>
      <p>And while neither Cait or Sophie have officially confirmed their relationship status, the latter described them as "partners in everything we do".</p>
      <p>"We’re inseparable, we’re business partners, we live together, we share a dog, we share family, we share a life together," she said.</p>
