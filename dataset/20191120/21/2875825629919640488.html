      <p>Gordon Ramsay says he is inspired to be a good dad because his own father was so bad.</p>
      <p>The celebrity chef said he wants to give his children a better life.</p>
      <p>The star, 53, says his dad, Gordon Snr, always favoured his brother, Ronnie. He said: “I had a tough relationship with dad because... my little brother was his favourite.”</p>
      <p>“I had a very humble upbringing – loved by my mother and, I think, loved by my father but I was desperate to get out the sh**hole I was in."</p>
      <p>Gordon said of his dad, who died in 1997 age 53: "I didn't want to turn out like my dad.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to live in a council house and put my kids to school with second-hand clothes. You strive to better yourself."</p>
