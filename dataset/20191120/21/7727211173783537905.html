      <p>Coleen Rooney has shared magical photos of her four sons - just in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Coleen shared several adorable snaps <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/coleen-wayne-rooney-pay-sweet-17190751">of her sons</a> Kai, Kit, Klay and Cass-Mac dressed in personalised Christmas pyjamas from Pretty Personal Gifting.</p>
      <p>In the photos they boys look like they've taken a trip to Santa's workshop - with the big man even making an appearance  in several of the shots.</p>
