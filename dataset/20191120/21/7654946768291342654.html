      <h1>Adam Lamberg will reprise Gordo role in ‘Lizzie McGuire’ revival</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:57:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:57</time> by <a rel="author">Marisa Dellatto</a></address>
      <p>This is what dreams are made of.</p>
      <p>Adam Lamberg, who played best bud Gordo in the early aughts Disney show “Lizzie McGuire,” has signed on to be part of the show’s revival.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnQzXXSTNfo&amp;feature=emb_title">a video</a> released Tuesday on the Disney+ YouTube channel, star <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5GBmHpj2-X/">Hilary Duff and Lamberg</a> made the announcement together.</p>
      <p>“Obviously the show would not be the same without her family,” Duff, 32, says.</p>
      <p>“Wait, [the] fam is not complete without me,” says Lamberg, now 35.</p>
      <p>Lamberg’s last acting credit was in 2008, when he played the lead character of Reggie in the film “Beautiful Loser.” Since then, he got his bachelor’s degree in geography from UC Berkeley and his Masters in public administration from Baruch College, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/28841-where-is-gordo-from-lizzie-mcguire-adam-lamberg-has-proven-art-imitates-life">according to Bustle</a>. In 2014, they reported that he was working at the Irish Arts Center in New York City.</p>

      <p>David “Gordo” Gordon was one of Lizzie’s best friends on the original show, which ran from 2001 to 2004. He and Lizzie struggled through middle school together, along with their other best friend Miranda Sanchez (played by Lalaine Vergara-Paras).</p>
      <p>The 2003 “Lizzie McGuire Movie” shows Gordo and Lizzie adventuring through Rome together on an eighth-grade graduation trip. The movie ends with them kissing.</p>
      <p>In the revival, Duff and Lamberg will be joined by original castmembers Jake Thomas, 29, who played Lizzie’s younger brother Matt, Hallie Todd, 57, who played her mother Jo, and Robert Carradine, 65, who played her father Sam.</p>
      <p>Vergara-Paras was notably not in the movie and she has yet to be announced as a cast member of the show. She posted an Instagram story in October that showed she got a text from Lamberg, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ehisosifo1/lalaine-text-adam-lamberg-lizzie-mcguire">according to BuzzFeed.</a></p>
      <p>Fans are beginning to notice her absence from the revival announcements.</p>

      <p>The new show will focus on Lizzie’s life as she’s about to turn 30. She now lives in New York City and works as an assistant to an interior designer and has a boyfriend — alhough if we know Lizzie, things aren’t going exactly as planned.</p>
      <p>There is no word on when the show will be released, though Duff told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1095190/gordo-s-back-lizzie-mcguire-casts-adam-lamberg-for-revival-series-on-disney">E News</a> that they’ve finished shooting the first episode already.</p>
