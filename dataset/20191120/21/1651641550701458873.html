      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is testing scheduled tweets for its web app, a feature cribbed from their TweetDeck app.</p>

      <p>The feature is currently only being tested with a fraction of Twitter users but has already received an enthusiastic reception from lucky users. The feature is useful for planned promotions, announcements and other professional users, but has less utility for day to day casual twitter users.</p>
      <p>The company has been increasingly busy in recent weeks, working on <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-pwa-soon-to-have-a-reddit-like-conversation-tree-feature/">threaded replies</a>, DM search and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-is-working-on-categorized-topic-list/">Categorized Topic</a> lists.</p>
      <p>Due to their apps being based on their web app the feature should become available to app users on Windows, iOS and Android in due course also.</p>
