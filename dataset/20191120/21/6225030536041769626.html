      <h1>Thursday's Best Bet: Going to the Lead can wire field at Laurel Park</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jarrod Horak</a></address>
      <p>Thursdayâ€™s 5th race from Laurel Park is a starter optional claiming event for 3-year-olds and up dashing seven furlongs on the main track (Post Time - 2:18 p.m. ET).</p>

      <p>#7 GOING TO THE LEAD (9-2) might be able to control the pace in a race without much pace. His numbers are slowly rising and all three of his local starts were strong.</p>
      <p>#1 Moti (5-2) turns back in distance, and he showed a nice late kick in both of his fast track sprints. His lone win was in his lone extended sprint try, and he romped by 9+ lengths that day. Trainer Anthony Farrior shows a +ROI with his route-to-sprint starters.</p>
      <p>#4 My Man Pots N Pans (6-1) turns back in his second start after a layoff and second start for Kelly Rubley. He will probably stalk the pace under +ROI sprint rider Sheldon Russell.</p>
      <p>#5 Marylander (4-1) is interesting if he is ready to run in his first start in more than four months. Lacey Gaudet has strong stats with her <i>first after the claim</i> starters. He graduated at this course/distance April 6, and will try to get involved late.</p>
