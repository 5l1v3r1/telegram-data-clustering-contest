      <p>White House aides and Trump campaign officials were "freaking out" after being "blindsided" by European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland's testimony on Wednesday, which contained <a href="https://theweek.com/5things/879610/eu-ambassador-sondland-describes-quid-pro-quo-ukraine-implicating-trump#1item">allegations of quid pro quo</a> and pointed fingers at the president and other top administration officials, <a href="https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/1197264235912474625">CNN's Jim Acosta reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The White House had attempted to get an "early peek" at Sondland's remarks during the jittery hours before the impeachment hearing began, due to the perception that he was a "wild card" witness, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-live-updates/2019/11/20/66ec806a-0b20-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html#link-CUVLCOEOGMY5PKIRNPZL2D7ITA"><i>The Washington Post</i> reports</a>. Sondland's attorney had refused those attempts.</p>
      <p>It became clear during the testimony, though, that Sondland's confirmation that "everyone was in the loop" was bad news for Republicans, who pivoted to attempting to distance Trump from what Democrats say was an attempt to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on Hunter Biden, the son of his potential 2020 rival. Trump's campaign <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-live-updates/2019/11/20/66ec806a-0b20-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html#link-CUVLCOEOGMY5PKIRNPZL2D7ITA">specifically zeroed in</a> on Sondland saying that Trump "directly told him he wanted nothing from Ukraine," although Sondland did confirm that the requests of Trump's personal lawyer and fixer Rudy Giuliani "were a quid pro quo for arranging a White House visit" for the Ukrainian president, and that "Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States."</p>
      <p>Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany maintained that "over and over we've heard from Democrats and the media that the next hearing, the next witness, the next testimony would be the bombshell they've been promising, only to have it fizzle out like all the rest. It has happened yet again." But Ken Starr, the lead prosecutor during the Bill Clinton impeachment hearings, begs to differ: "This obviously has been one of those bombshell days," <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879707/ken-starr-sondland-testimony-over">he told Fox News</a>.</p>
