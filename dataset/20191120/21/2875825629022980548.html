      <p>"I’m all for having an ace time and getting involved at a show, but bringing what’s essentially an explosive into a packed arena thinking you’re billy big b******s, nah thanks.</p>
      <p>Another said she also ended up in a dangerous situation at the gig.</p>

      <p>Stacey, of Boston, Lincolnshire, was near the front of the stage when she was struck by the lit projectile, which ignited her clothing and burned her skin underneath.</p>
      <p>She was rushed from the venue, the FlyDSA Arena in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Stacey told the BBC: "The flare hit my head and fell down my top, at first I didn't realise what had happened until people shouted.</p>
      <p>"It looks like someone let a firework off on my chest."</p>
