      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:25:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p>RuPaul's Drag Race UK star Cheryl Hole has reached out to her idol <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cheryl">Cheryl</a> in the hope of teaming up on a duet.</p>
      <p>The drag queen, who was the seventh to be eliminated from the BBC Three series, had the chance to meet the Girls Aloud star when she appeared as a guest judge.</p>
      <p>And after her dream came true, she's hoping they could end up working together in 2020.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old even went as far as to brand Chezza the "best guest judge of the season".</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7706667/RuPauls-Drag-Race-UK-EXCLUSIVE-Cheryl-Hole-teases-collaboration-idol-Cheryl.html">MailOnline</a> : "We have crossed paths since filming and she’s an absolute icon. Who knows, 2020 we might be delivering some Cheryl and Cheryl!</p>
      <p>"I’m putting feelers out there so Chez if you’re listening, not that she’d be listening in on our phone call, but, yea, I’m definitely up for it."</p>
