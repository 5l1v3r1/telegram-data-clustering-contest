      <h1>Mumbai University’s Kalina campus likely to see commercial activities</h1>
      <h2>Spread over 243 acres, the Kalina campus was originally tagged as a no-development zone, which had imposed restrictions on construction activities on campus.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:32:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/neeraj-tiwari/" target="_blank">Neeraj Tiwari</a></address>
      <p>TO RAISE resources for the much-touted revamp of Mumbai University’s (MU) Kalina campus in the suburbs, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning commercial use of a portion of the land.</p>
      <p>Spread over 243 acres, the Kalina campus was originally tagged as a no-development zone, which had imposed restrictions on construction activities on campus. Last September, in a bid to push the modernisation plan, then Maharashtra CM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> had modified the land-use pattern of the campus, reserving it for a university.</p>
      <p>Mumbai’s new development plan, which is now in force, permits a high floor space index (FSI) for institutional buildings. FSI is a development tool that defines the extent of construction permissible on a plot. It is the ratio of built-up-area to the plot area.</p>
      <p>But the MMRDA, which was in March appointed as the campus’ special planning authority, has now proposed further dilution of the land-use. The state-run agency has sought permission to allow mixed land-use, including commercial activity.</p>
      <p>Confirming this, Dilip Kavathkar, joint project director of MMRDA, said: “We have sent a proposal to the state government to allow for mixed land-use.” Kavathkar said the agency is in the process of formulating a master plan for the multi-crore revamp.</p>
      <p>According to initial estimates, the project, which would include a new multi-storey academic building, a sports complex, an incubation centre, a cultural centre and world-class research facilities, will cost Rs 3,000 crore. To foot the bill, monetisation of a portion of the land through commercial use has been proposed, said senior officials. The land is in close proximity to Mumbai’s premier business district — the Bandra Kurla Complex.</p>
      <p>The plan to modify the land-use pattern is also reflected in the agency’s document seeking bidders for the formulation of the master plan. In September, when the MMRDA originally floated bids for the master plan, it listed the permissible land use as “educational and institutional”. But last week, the agency issued a corrigendum, revising the qualification criterion, inviting even those who have undertaken mixed land use projects (residential-cum-commercial-cum-institutional) to prepare the master plan.</p>
      <p>When contacted, a senior MU official said, “We have submitted our own requirements. The MMRDA is now readying a master plan.”</p>
