      <h1>Julie Andrews: Watching husband Blake Edwards direct orgy scene was ‘sweet’</h1>

      <p>But was the orgy as “sweet” as a spoonful of sugar?</p>
      <p>Julie Andrews, 84, recalled a memory from her past watching her late husband Blake Edwards direct a massive orgy for a movie, calling the wild sex scene “sweet” and “adorable.”</p>

      <p>The “Mary Poppins” actress, who is on a book tour to promote her new memoir “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Home-Work-Memoir-Hollywood-Years/dp/0316349259?tag=nypost-20">Home Work: A Memoir of My Hollywood Years</a>,” said she was filming the 1979 movie “10” when Edwards, who was directing the film, called her to the set. When she arrived, she learned it wasn’t to film any scenes she was in, but rather to watch a “manufactured” X-rated scene involving an orgy.</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘Julie, you’ve just gotta come on over here, it’s an unbelievable sight.’ So I went dashing over,” Andrews recalled during an appearance on “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIrF6bUuPvo">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>.”</p>
      <p>“What Blake had done was hire an awful lot of people who really are very at ease doing orgy films, I guess,” she added of her late husband, who <a href="https://nypost.com/2010/12/17/pink-panther-director-blake-edwards-dies-at-88/">died in 2010</a>.</p>
      <p>Andrews was not part of the scene but did spot co-star Dudley Moore in the nude smack dab in the middle of other naked bodies.</p>
      <p>“I walked in and everyone was stark naked and lying around, very happily and casually, treating it totally normally. And there was sweet Dudley in the middle of it all and he wasn’t very, very tall,” she said. “Blake put him between two enormously statuesque ladies and so he was completely naked and these two ladies were naked, but their bums were up here and little Dudley‘s was down there.”</p>

      <p>But while it might seem shocking to see the star of “The Sound of Music” and “The Princess Diaries,” now 84, as a voyeur of an orgy, Andrews insisted the whole thing was “sweet” and “adorable,” particularly watching Moore, star of “Arthur” and 1967’s “Bedazzled,” engage in a fake orgy.</p>
      <p>“So sweet,” she said. “It was more adorable than anything else because Dudley was so adorable.”</p>
      <p>The legendary rom-com “10” about a famous composer on the verge of a mid-life crisis who lusts over a younger woman stars Andrews, Moore, Robert Webber and Bo Derek, whose braids-on-the-beach look became infamous after the movie.</p>
      <p>In her new book written with daughter Emma Walton Hamilton, Andrews discusses much of her storied film career as well as how she met Blake Edwards, whom she went on to have two kids with, in <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/23/julie-andrews-on-how-therapy-saved-her-life-after-divorce/">therapy after her divorce</a> from first husband Tony Walton.</p>
      <p>“I’ve lived an awful long time,” Andrews joked with DeGeneres. “I just wanted to be as honest as I could.”</p>
