      <p>Steam Remote Play Together, a feature that connects friends to play local multiplayer games online, launched today after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/21/20925362/steams-remote-play-together-feature-beta-local-multiplayer-co-op-connect-online">a monthlong beta test</a>. The full launch extends remote local multiplayer to iOS and Android devices using the Steam Link app.</p>
      <p>Steam Remote Play Together, ideal for couch co-op games like <i>Enter the Gungeon</i>, <i>Cuphead</i><i>, </i>or <i>Wilmot’s Warehouse</i>, joins up to four players and “even more in ideal conditions,” Valve said. Only the host needs to own the game, too.</p>
      <p>For those needing suggestions on what games work best with Remote Play Together, Valve kicked off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/together?snr=1_4_4__118">a streaming event at noon</a>, running to 8 p.m. EST. There is also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/together">sales event</a> featuring Steam’s usual deep discounts applied to many local multiplayer-friendly titles and franchises.</p>
      <p>The feature is initiated with the Remote Play Together icon in the host’s friends’ list. Simply click on it to invite them. The game should behave on the host’s device as if all the invited players had a controller plugged into it. The other players will only be able to see the game, not the host’s desktop or overlays.</p>
