      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. â€” There is confusion surrounding FGCU's Club Football team.</p>
      <p>That's after the university says someone connected to the team asked more than a hundred people from across the country to come and play for them.</p>
      <p>But they didn't make it clear to those who accepted offers that they'd be joining a club team and not an NCAA team.</p>
      <p>Twitter and Facebook have been flooded with excitement from those who have accepted these offers.</p>
      <p>But according to FGCU, it appears many of them don't realize what they've accepted.</p>
      <p>The university said the offers were made by a Football Club volunteer and were done without the school's knowledge.</p>
      <p>They also want to remind those who have accepted the offer that they'll have to be admitted to the university before they can even consider playing for the football club.</p>
      <p>We spoke to one student who says his roommate plays for the team.</p>
      <p>We've reached out to the FGCU Football Club for comment but have not heard back yet.</p>
