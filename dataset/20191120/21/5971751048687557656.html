      <p>Nokia 2720 Flip is a gorgeously designed phone, and in red looks even better. Well, I was thinking that until I s<a href="https://nokiamob.net/2019/11/19/nokia-mobile-announced-nokia-2720-flip-in-red-color/">aw that glossy black cover</a>. However, I’ll have better judgement when I check the device and hold it in hands. Anyway, I like this idea of reviving old Nokia models, and the flip phone is a thing of 2019. The first time I saw 2720, I was trying to imagine if the phone could be modernized a bit more, or even turned into an Android smartphone. When the phone is closed, the front glossy part could be turned completely into a touch-sensitive screen. Nokia mobile went for a poorly used notification screen instead, but a larger screen would have more sense if it was an Android phone.</p>

      <p>Then, when you flip it open, one could get an idea of stretching the screen fully in the upper part. Also, the control buttons and a keyboard could be replaced by another screen. That way you would get a device with three touch-sensitive screens. The bottom one could be used as a keyboard, or serve for a split-screen option when you are not typing.</p>

      <p>Than, Moto Razr happened recently, and my idea of a foldable device with a touch screen was realized. There are some concerns with the foldable screens being sensitive, but Moto Razr looks like a better realized foldable phone.<br/>I know that Nokia Mobile doesn’t have huge funds to manufacture a phone with a foldable screen, but they could have done it differently. For example, and Android running Nokia 2720 Flip with three touch-sensitive screens would be a cool device. OK, there would still be a huge hinge in the middle, but the device would raise some interest. Maybe a Concept creator could work out something like that just to give us an idea.</p>
