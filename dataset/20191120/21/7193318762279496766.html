      <p>Thanksgiving is a time best spent with friends, family and the rest of your loved ones, including those of the four-legged variety.</p>
      <p>You may enjoy spending time with the ones you love around the holidays, but it can be a stressful -- not to mention dangerous -- time for your pets. If your furry friend is tagging along for Thanksgiving, here are some tips to keep in mind from <a href="https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/thanksgiving-pet-safety.aspx">veterinarians </a>and other animal <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/thanksgiving-safety-tips">experts</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let your friends, family and guests know if they shouldn’t feed your pet food scraps from the meal, especially if your pet has food restrictions. Here’s a list of people foods that pets should not eat.</li>
        <li>Pets can make a mess in new environments, so keep candles, holiday decorations, plants, extension cords and other items that your pet may want to chew on out of reach, and make sure your pet can’t get into the garbage can.</li>
        <li>Do not allow your pets to chew on bones left over from the meal, as they can split and injure your pet’s intestines or cause choking.</li>
        <li>Do not let your pets eat any raw ingredients in dough or batter. Furthermore, yeast dough can cause bloating and painful gas in pets.</li>
        <li>Keep an eye on the exits. Even if your pet is comfortable, you never know when they may take the opportunity to dart out an open door.</li>
        <li>Keep foods like pie or desserts with artificial sweeteners away from pets, as they can cause liver damage, hypoglycemia, seizures and other serious health issues.</li>
        <li>Keep fatty foods, especially turkey or turkey skin, away from your pet, as they can cause pancreatitis.</li>
        <li>If you’re flying with your pet, try to book direct flights and only use approved carriers and crates. Make sure you have a health certificate from your veterinarian.</li>
        <li>If you’re driving with your pet, make sure your pet’s carrier is safe and secure, and never leave your pet alone in a parked vehicle, regardless of the weather</li>
        <li>Make sure your pet’s identification information is up to date.</li>
        <li>Check with your family members to make sure it’s OK if your pet tags along to the festivities, and ask if they have any pets that may make your pet feel stressed, angry or scared.</li>
      </ul>
