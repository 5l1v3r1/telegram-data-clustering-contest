      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tessa-blanchard">Tessa Blanchard</a> is seen as one of the best female wrestlers of the current generation, as the daughter of WWE Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/tessa-blanchard">Tully Blanchard</a>, it's an interesting development to see that Tessa isn't currently part of the WWE Women's Division but instead is part of Impact Wrestling where she is showing that Intergender Wrestling still has a place in the modern product.</p>
      <p>Tessa was once in a relationship with current WWE star Ricochet, who currently performs on the company's Raw roster, but the duo split just after Ricochet joined WWE and he's now reportedly dating Kacy Catanzaro who performs on the NXT brand.</p>
      <p>Tessa herself has moved on and has been in a relationship with fellow Impact Wrestling star for a number of months. It came as quite a shock earlier today when the star announced on her Instagram page that the couple had decided to tie the knot.</p>

      <p>Blanchard had a short stint with NXT a few years ago and will be best known for being the stunt double for Paige's character in her film Fighting With My Family, that was released earlier this year.</p>
