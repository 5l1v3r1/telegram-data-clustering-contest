      <p><b>J.T. Petty</b>, who horror fans may remember as the director behind <i>Soft for Digging, The Burrowers, and Hellbenders</i>, is returning to film after penning several video games from “The Walking Dead” to Tom Clancy’s “Splinter Cell” and “Outlast”.</p>
      <p>Petty has written and is set to direct <b><i>Appetite</i></b>, a missing-persons thriller to be produced by David S. Goyer’s Phantom Four, reports <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/appetite-jt-petty-movie-phantom-four-1202791226/">Deadline</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The plot centers on a mother who investigates her daughter’s disappearance leading to inexplicable and terrible consequences.</blockquote>
      <p>“J.T. has crafted a unique vision that completely upends the missing child genre in a fresh and unpredictable way,” Goyer said in a release announcing the news. “We are excited to help him bring to life this truly original tale.”</p>
      <p>The project is moving forward as Productivity Media has come aboard to fully finance the pic. Casting is underway with a first-quarter 2020 start date being eyed.</p>
