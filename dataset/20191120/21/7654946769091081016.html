      <h1>Real-estate tycoon’s ex-gal pal surrenders for alleged assault</h1>

      <p>The ex-girlfriend of millionaire real-estate tycoon Michael Shah was arrested Wednesday after her former beau <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/real-estate-developer-who-split-ex-gal-pals-lip-says-she-repeatedly-assaulted-him/">accused her of three separate attacks</a> — including stomping on his foot with a stiletto heel and swiping his cellphone.</p>
      <p>After Bhavana Chamoli, 28, surrendered to the 13th Precinct, but the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told cops they would decline to prosecute pending the outcome of an investigation, and she was released without charges.</p>
      <p>Shah filed a police report in November accusing Chamoli of theft and assault after he was arrested in September for roughing her up, and again in October for violating an order of protection.</p>
      <p>“The Manhattan District Attorney’s Office is not in the business of prosecuting domestic violence victims, and we should all be terrified if they started doing so with Ms. Chamoli,” said her lawyer, Jeremy Saland.</p>
      <p>In an interview Tuesday, she told The Post that Shah’s allegations were “all lies.”</p>
      <p>The Carnegie Mellon graduate, who once dabbled in modeling, admitted she stepped on his foot July 20 during a spat in front of Park Bar in Union Square but only because he wouldn’t let her go.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t wearing stilettos by the way,” she added. “They were kitten heels, and I stomped on his foot just to get away.”</p>
      <p>On Sept. 29, Chamoli first called the cops on the 42-year-old head of Delshah Capital, who she met on Tinder, after he allegedly punched her in the back of the head and split her lip during an argument at his Union Square apartment.</p>
      <p>He was charged with misdemeanor assault, attempted assault and aggravated harassment and a judge issued an order of protection barring any contacting with her.</p>

      <p>In Shah’s Nov. 7 police report, he said that Chamoli was the aggressor, flipping a glass coffee table on the floor, shattering a $2,000 chandelier and smacking him in the head.</p>
      <p>Still, the two made up and Shah apologized with an $11,000 Cartier bracelet — but the reconciliation was short-lived.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 25, Shah was at Chamoli’s apartment in violation of the protective order when she says she saw a series of inappropriate texts he’d sent other women and the two got into a tussle over his phone.</p>
      <p>In an attempt to wrestle the phone back, he allegedly straddled her as he held her down and used his head to hit her nose, she said.</p>
      <p>To get him off, she admitted to The Post that she “bit him once or twice on his face near his lips.”</p>
      <p>The police were called, but Shah took off before they arrived. He later turned himself in on a felony contempt charge for violating the protective order.</p>
      <p>Chamoli, an investment researcher for MIO Partners, Inc, insisted that Shah accidentally left his phone in her apartment, and her lawyer has turned it over to authorities.</p>
      <p>“I was shocked,” she said of learning Shah had filed a police complaint against her.</p>
      <p>She said that he had manipulated and abused her and now fears that his allegations could affect her work visa. “He’s trying to intimidate me,” she said.</p>
      <p>Saland added, “Unfortunately, any defendant can fabricate claims in an attempt to shield themselves from accountability.”</p>
      <p>Shah’s spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>
