      <p>Victoria is the host with the most.</p>
      <p>That’s what the golf pros on the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada say. The Bayview Place DCBank Open presented by the Times Colonist at Uplands Golf Club was voted the best stop on the 2019 Tour. The inaugural Players’ Choice Award for best tournament was announced Wednesday at the PGA Tour’s annual meeting in Ponte Verda Beach, Florida.</p>
      <p>There were 12 tournaments on the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada this year.</p>
      <p>“This is great for Victoria, the sponsors and volunteers,” said Bayview Place tournament director Murray Thomas.</p>
      <p>“A lot of hard work has gone into it over the years. Uplands is always in meticulous shape for the tournament and everyone is welcoming to the players and they enjoy it here. I always tell the players: ‘It’s good to see you but I hope to never see you again except on TV at the next level [Korn Ferry Tour followed by the PGA Tour].’ ”</p>
      <p>Since 2013, when the Canadian Tour became the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, several players from the Victoria tournament have gone on to the PGA Tour, including seven PGA Tour tournament winners in Tony Finau, Mackenzie Hughes, Nick Taylor, Aaron Wise, Adam Long, Corey Conners and C.T. Pan.</p>
      <p>Canadian Tour alumni to play on the PGA Tour include the likes of Steve Stricker, Craig Parry, Brandt Jobe, Todd Hamilton, Ken Duke, Stuart Appleby, Mike Weir, Kirk Triplett, Chris DiMarco, Scott McCarron, Tim Clark and Tim Herron. Canadian tour alumni Weir, Hamilton and Michael Campbell have won majors.</p>
      <p>“It tell them they are always welcome back on holiday,” quipped Thomas.</p>
      <p>The 38th Victoria tournament will be held June 4-6 at Uplands.</p>
      <p>“The players always tell us they love the Victoria tournament,” said Keith Dagg, one of four co-founders of the event nearly four decades ago, and a key member of the board of directors.</p>
      <p>“We have 250 volunteers and they continue to give.”</p>
      <p>The Mackenzie Tour said it appreciates the efforts of the Victoria committee and volunteers.</p>
      <p>“The Bayview Place DCBank Open has made a conscious effort to improve its event year in and year out, and no better indicator of that is its charitable contributions over the last number of years,” said Tour vice-president Scott Pritchard.</p>
      <p>“The event this year contributed just under $200,000 for the Children’s Health Foundation of Vancouver Island.”</p>
