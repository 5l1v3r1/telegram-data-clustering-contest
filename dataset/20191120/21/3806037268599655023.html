      <p>Three months after teaming up with Ian Isiah for the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/8/theophilus-london-pretty-ian-isiah-music-video">“Pretty” visual</a>, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/theophilus-london">Theophilus London</a> appears on the latest single from <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/jimmy-edgar">Jimmy Edgar</a> and <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/machinedrum">Machinedrum</a>‘s collaborative J-E-T-S project. Titled “Come Alive,” J-E-T-S and London’s new track is being released to support and promote the forthcoming J-E-T-S EP <i>ZAPS</i>. The follow-up to J-E-T-S’ debut full-length album <i>ZOOSPA</i>, <i>ZAPS</i> is on course to deliver six songs to listeners, including this week’s offering and additional collaborations with Tearz, Fidelia, Roses Gabor, Muzi and Zack Slime Fr.</p>
      <p>“I’m a visual person. 95% of my art is visual. All of my art speaks for itself and, you know, I’m an artist and I come up with these ideas and these concepts. I find a concept that I like, I remake it and, you know, that kind of thing,” Theophilus London previously shared with <a href="https://acclaimmag.com/music/interview-theophilus-london/"><i>Acclaim</i></a>. “I don’t have no genre or anything like that. I’m an artist, I’m a voice of a generation. I can do an African album, I can do a Brazilian album, I can sing a Cuban album, I can sing an Austrian album. I can do whatever I favour at the moment. It’s just that I’m a voice and it’s my fantasy and what’s coming through my headspace … I’m not one thing, I’ll never be one thing. And, whatever you want to connect it with, that’s fine, that’s great.”</p>
