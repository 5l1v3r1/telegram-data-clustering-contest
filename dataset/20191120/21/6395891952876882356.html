      <p>"I am so thankful for 18 incredible years of racing in NASCAR," Johnson said in the black-and-white video comprising highlights from his career. "This sport has been good to me and allowed me to do something I truly love. I showed up chasing a dream and achieved more than I ever thought possible. I'm looking forward to next season and celebrating what will be my last year as a full-time NASCAR Cup driver. I know what this team is capable of and I hope 2020 is one of the best yet."</p>
      <p>Johnson, 44, spent his career racing for Hendrick Motorsports since he debuted in 2011, <a href="https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/11/20/jimmie-johnson-retire-2020-season-seven-time-champion-nascar/">NASCAR.com</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Johnson has 83 career victories, tied with Cale Yarborough for sixth on NASCAR's all-time list, <a href="https://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/story/_/id/28123212/jimmie-johnson-2020-final-year-full-driver">ESPN </a>reported. He is tied with Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Sr. for the most NASCAR series titles.</p>
      <p>"NASCAR history will always hold Jimmie Johnson in the highest regard, for his hard-charging success on the racetrack and the way he conducted himself as a champion off the track," NASCAR Chairman and CEO Jim France said in a statement. "This remarkable seven-time champion – through his competitive spirit, immense talent and sportsmanship – has made NASCAR a better sport. On behalf of my family and the entire NASCAR community, I thank Jimmie for his dedication to NASCAR and, along with his legions of fans, wish him all the best in his final season.  I look forward to watching him race for wins and an eighth NASCAR Cup Championship in 2020."</p>
