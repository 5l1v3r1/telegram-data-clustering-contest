      <h1>'Too many white faces': CBP chief Mark Morgan discussed ditching choice of white man to lead Border Patrol</h1>

      <p>Customs and Border Protection is backpedaling from its internal plan to appoint a white man as the next Border Patrol leader, despite publicly claiming it did not have a diversity problem at the management level, the <i>Washington Examiner</i> has learned.</p>
      <p>During a closed-door meeting with Border Patrol leadership several weeks ago, acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan complained about the number of “white faces" at Border Patrol’s Pennsylvania Avenue national office, according to three senior CBP officials. A fourth person recalled Morgan saying there were "too many white male faces at the Border Patrol HQ.” The meeting ended with the understanding that a Hispanic woman, Gloria Chavez, would be appointed Border Patrol chief instead of Rodney Scott, who is white and who had been selected internally over the summer.</p>
      <p>Morgan’s private comments were prior to a November media interview where he <a href="https://www.axios.com/border-patrol-diversity-race-gender-leadership-1b959049-49c8-422b-854e-f9724ee09977.html">said</a> he did not view white men at the helm of DHS and CBP as an issue, despite the agency's work arresting primarily Latin Americans who illegally crossed into the U.S.</p>
      <p>“I live by the principle that people should be judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin," Morgan responded in an emailed statement to the <i>Washington Examiner</i> Wednesday afternoon. "I am also committed to leading an agency that is inclusive of everyone, no matter their ethnic background. For anyone to suggest otherwise is simply false. As I have said to my senior staff, I want to ensure that we have leaders who will drive mission success while serving the men and women of CBP.”</p>
      <p>Half a dozen officials at the very top of CBP have shared with the <i>Washington Examiner</i> over the past month what they described as a leadership crisis over Border Patrol's next leader. Border Patrol is a division of CBP.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Examiner</i> <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-chief-carla-provost-to-leave-before-years-end-sources">first reported in May</a> that Carla Provost was planning to depart the 20,000-person agency after a total 16 months as its chief. The job does not require Senate confirmation, and the next person will be nominated by the CBP commissioner — in this case, Morgan.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, Scott was selected internally. Scott was a regional chief in San Diego, California, and recently moved to Washington, where he took over as national acting deputy Border Patrol chief in late October.</p>
      <p>One person said Morgan’s attempt to promote someone who is not a white man is meant as a show of goodwill to outside organizations after he did not push out Provost despite her <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/customs-and-border-protection-moving-to-fire-and-discipline-dozens-of-agents-for-facebook-posts">membership and participation in a controversial Facebook group</a>, “I’m 10-15.” Provost is leaving on her own accord.</p>
      <p>Officials in the room walked away with the impression the chief’s job would go to Chavez, who had been tapped for deputy chief, serving under Scott. Chavez has been in the Border Patrol since 1995 and was temporarily assigned from her post in El Centro, California, to interim chief to the El Paso region in late July.</p>
      <p>The El Paso region, where Chavez is temporarily stationed, was widely reported on this summer for poor conditions at Border Patrol facilities where migrants taken into custody for illegal entry were forced to live for days to weeks, including <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/outside-for-days-officials-slammed-for-keeping-migrants-under-bridge-move-them-to-a-parking-lot">under bridges, in uncovered parking lots</a>, and in <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/border-patrol-holding-900-at-facility-fit-for-125-in-situation-that-could-turn-violent">overcrowded cells</a>. Chavez took over after these problems were revealed. “They’re trying to set her up to be the superstar,” said a senior Border Patrol official. “It appears [acting DHS secretary] Chad Wolf’s first border trip is going to be to El Paso [this month]," the official said. “Even though most of this stuff was already fixed, they’re giving her the credit for it.”</p>
      <p>Morgan’s plan to move Chavez in as border chief came as a shock to some in the meeting, who knew Scott had been picked months ago and who worry Border Patrol is already not in good hands with Morgan, who spent his career at the FBI, as the top boss.</p>
      <p>Two sources said Scott has recently become unsure about taking over for Provost, even aside Morgan’s inclination not to promote a white man.</p>
