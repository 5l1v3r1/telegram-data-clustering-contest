      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> chairman Daniel Levy told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> he will have to sell in January if he wishes to add to his squad.</p>
      <p>The Portuguse was appointed as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s replacement on Tuesday and took training on Wednesday for the first time.</p>
      <p>No manager has spent more than Mourinho in football history and he splurged around £300m in five transfer windows at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is on wages of around £13m-a-year in north London, significantly more than the £8m-a-year given to Pochettino and he was hired on the provision that he could rescue Spurs’ bid for the top four.</p>

      <p>But the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/jose-mourinho-tottenham-told-no-money-transfers-january?CMP=share_btn_tw">Guardian</a> claim he will not be given funds to strengthen in January as Spurs simply do not have the finances. The club’s new stadium exceeded original pricing and cost around £1bn and Mourinho will have to sell before he can bring in any new faces.</p>

      <p>It’s claimed Mourinho was made well aware of the situation before taking the job and is willing to work with the squad that he’s inherited before being allocated funds next summer.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese made a point of talking up the current squad, as well as the academy, during his first interview as Tottenham boss on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>‘I really like this squad and looking to the young players – there is not one manager in the world that doesn’t like to play young players and to help young players to develop. There is not one,’ said Mourinho.</p>
