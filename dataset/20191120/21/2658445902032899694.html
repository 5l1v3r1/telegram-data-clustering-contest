      <p>“Also, the weed substances shall be destroyed by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA),” the Judge said.</p>
      <p>Before the pronouncement, the Defence counsel, Mr Bassey Okon, had prayed the court to have mercy on his client by reducing his jail term.</p>
      <p>Earlier, counsel to the NDLEA, Oyo State Command, Mr Raphael Himinkaiye, had told the court that the convict was facing a one-count charge bordering on unlawful transportation of cannabis.</p>
      <p>He also said that Tela committed the crime on July 27 2017 in Ibadan.</p>
      <p>Himinkaiye said the convict was apprehended in possession of 35 parcels of compressed cannabis which weighed 37 kg in a Toyota Camry with Reg. No. KJA91ML and a sum of N67, 000.</p>
      <p>He stated that the offence was contrary to and punishable under Section 11 (B) of the NDLEA Act Cap N30 Law of the Federation 2004.</p>
      <p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity, all the lawyers who witnessed the judgment expressed reservation, describing the judgment as being too ash.</p>
