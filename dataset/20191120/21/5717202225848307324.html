      <h1>Arsenal fans react as Harry Redknapp suggests Mauricio Pochettino could take over</h1>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1197068624147681281">Harry Redknapp has bizzarely suggested on TalkSPORT</a> that sacked Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino could replace under-pressure Arsenal boss Unai Emery at The Emirates – and Gunners fans have welcomed the idea.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday night after a very poor start to the 2019-20 campaign. Spurs sit in 14th place in the Premier League, have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup, and lost 7-2 to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Just hours later on Wednesday morning, Pochettino had been replaced by Jose Mourinho. The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager had been out of work since December 2018, following his exit from Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs boss Redknapp was asked about Pochettino’s next career move, and he reckons a move to Tottenham’s north London rivals Arsenal could be on the cards – with Emery under enormous pressure after an equally poor start to the season.</p>

      <p>“Do you think the Arsenal fans wouldn’t love him there?” <a href="https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1197068624147681281">Redknapp said.</a> “You start winning football matches, they don’t give a monkeys. Sol Campbell went from Tottenham to Arsenal, George Graham did it.</p>
      <p>“It can happen, as long as you go and do the job. They’ll be looking at it thinking, could we, can we?”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has added another big name to his impressive CV, after managing the likes of Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Manchester United, Chelsea and Porto. Whether he can be a success at Tottenham, remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans reacted to the news that Redknapp had suggested Pochettino could replace Emery at The Emirates Stadium – despite Pochettino stating himself he could never manage Arsenal. Gunners supporters are intrigued over such an idea.</p>
