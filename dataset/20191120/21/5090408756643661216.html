        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-mug">Travel mugs</a> are great in theory, but many are prone to spilling, leaking, or not actually keeping things hot, or cold, enough.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2SGMrGH">Contigo Autoseal West Loop Travel Mug</a> ($12-$24 at Amazon, price varies by color and size) automatically closes, is spill-proof and leak-proof, and keeps drinks hot for up to five hours, making it an affordable and convenient buy that also provides some peace of mind.</li>
        <li>It is our top pick for the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-mug">best travel mug in our buying guide</a>, and after using it myself, I couldn’t agree more.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I love a warm beverage in the morning. Whether it’s a freshly brewed coffee, steeped tea, or just some hot water with lemon, sitting down and enjoying a warm drink has become somewhat of a morning ritual – even in the heat of summer. The problem is, most mornings I don’t have time to actually sit down and sip, so I’m forced to choose – relinquish the ritual or take it on the go.</p>
      <p>In the past, I would just pour my drinks into any old travel mug and hope for the best; my wishful thinking was often met with leaks, spills, and hot coffee that went cold too soon. I quickly realized not all travel mugs are created equal.</p>
      <p>With so many options out there, it’s a good idea to consider factors other than just aesthetics. Think about your lifestyle. Do you want to just throw your mug in your backpack for later? Will you need something with a handle to grip onto while you’re commuting on the subway? Do you want something to keep in your cupholder for road trips and morning rides to work?</p>
      <p>Whatever your needs, there is definitely a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-mug">travel mug</a> to fit them. But, if you want just one mug that can do it all – and for a great price – you need the <a href="https://amzn.to/2SGMrGH">Contigo Autoseal West Loop Travel Mug</a>.</p>
      <h3>The details of the <a href="https://amzn.to/2SGMrGH">Contigo Autoseal West Loop Travel Mug</a></h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2SGMrGH">Contigo Autoseal West Loop</a> may look like your average stainless steel travel cup, but its smart features make it a superior, albeit affordable, option.</p>
      <p>As the name suggests, the main draw to this mug is its Autoseal technology. Simply press the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-mug">Autoseal</a> button to take a sip and let it go when you’re done; it’ll reseal automatically. A spill-proof and leak-proof seal ensures you’ll never have to deal with the frustration of spilling hot coffee on your clean pants while driving to work or finding dribbles on your homework after tossing your mug in your backpack. There’s also a lock right above the Autoseal button, so you can lock the bottle and make sure it’s never accidentally popped open. You can even add accoutrements, like a <a href="https://amzn.to/2LGoHls">tea infuser accessory</a>, to make your bottle even more suited to your needs.</p>
      <p>Insulated stainless steel will keep your hot beverages hot for up to five hours, and your cold beverages cold for up to 12. The cup is pretty low-maintenance – you can throw the lid in the dishwasher for easy cleaning, but the body needs to be hand washed.</p>
      <p>With 16-, 20-, and 24-ounce options in a variety of colors, there is something for everyone.</p>

      <h3>My experience</h3>
      <p>While I like to sit down on quiet mornings with a mug of hot tea or coffee, on busy mornings all bets are off. I rush, throw my things haphazardly into a bag, and run off to wherever I’m going. I’ve used other travel mugs that say they’ll stay sealed, and trusting these promises I’ve put them in my bag just to find coffee stains on my notebook once I got to work. I almost gave up on travel mugs until I came across this one from Contigo at my childhood home. Hidden in the back of a cabinet filled with water bottles, was this glimmer of hope that I <i>could</i> have a hot cup of coffee to wake me up on my way to my summer internship.</p>
      <p>After it sustained a long car ride, potholes included, without leaking even a drop of coffee, I knew this mug was a keeper. The Autoseal is legit; it really provides a tight seal and I haven’t dealt with any leaks or spills. I typically will lock it if it’s getting thrown in a bag, just so none of my other items accidentally press the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-mug">Autoseal</a> button. I appreciate the peace of mind I get from knowing I don’t have to constantly look into my backpack to make sure my mug isn’t toppled over and leaking all over my belongings. The automatic aspect means you’ll never forget to close the lid; it’s already done for you. I haven’t had any problems with my things staying hot or cold. In my opinion, you can’t beat the peace of mind, convenience, and affordability of this product.</p>
      <h3>The bottom line</h3>
      <p>The Contigo Autoseal West Loop is our team pick for the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-travel-mug#the-best-travel-mug-overall-1">best travel mug you can buy</a>, and for good reason.

It may not be <i>perfect </i>but for just $25 or less, it’s a great purchase.</p>
