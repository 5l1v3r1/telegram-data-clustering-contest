      <h2>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is said to be waiting for Barcelona transfer interest after shelving Arsenal contract talks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:00:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has reportedly postponed talks over a contract extension as he scopes out Barcelona's interest.</p>
      <p>The Catalan club have been linked with a move for Aubameyang, who is out of contract at the Emirates in 2021.</p>
      <p>The Gabonese striker has stalled on signing a new contract with reports suggesting he could look to leave north London if they fail to secure a return to Champions League football.</p>
      <p>That has led to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> monitoring his situation - and <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/aubameyang-postpones-contract-talks-with-arsenal-waiting-for-barca-7744334">Sport</a> claim he is keen to wait and discover the level of that interest before resuming talks over an <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> extension.</p>

      <p>Aubameyang, recently named as Arsenal's captain to replace Granit Xhaka, has been a favourite at Arsenal since his move from Borussia Dortmund in 2018.</p>
      <p>But reports suggest the club have agreed they will listen to offers at the end of the season if they miss out on the top four and he decides his future lies elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He could be a replacement for the ageing Luis Suarez, 32, who recently admitted the club could be looking to replace him as No.9 at the Nou Camp.</p>

      <p>"If the club are looking for, or wish to bring in another number nine, it would not be strange, it is the reality of football," Suarez said in an interview in his native Uruguay.</p>
      <p>"A time will arrive when my age will not allow me to play at the level Barcelona require, but while I can, and while I have the strength to compete, I will."</p>
