      <h1>Group backing specialized high school exams calls Richard Carranza ‘thin skinned’</h1>

      <p>A pro-specialized high school exam group backed by Richard Parsons and Ronald Lauder ripped schools Chancellor Richard Carranza as “thin-skinned” and “intellectually dishonest” after he dismissed its legitimacy.</p>
      <p>The latest tit-for-tat comes after City Hall lost its first round at the state Capitol to scrap the tests, which are required to gain admission to eight of New York’s most prestigious public high schools.</p>
      <p>“The only people that have engaged against this have been millionaires,” Carranza told a community meeting in the Bronx Tuesday night, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2019/11/19/carranza-tells-legislature-get-out-of-my-way-on-admissions-1228364">according to Politico New York</a>. “My message is ‘give me a better plan.’ I’m all ears and I’m still waiting.”</p>
      <p>The leader of Education Equity, Kirsten John Foy, returned fire Wednesday — claiming the $353,000-a-year chancellor won’t meet with critics.</p>
      <p>“If Chancellor Carranza is too thin-skinned and not prepared for robust multilateral engagement with people he may have a disagreement with, then he shouldn’t have taken the job as New York City Schools’ Chancellor,” Foy said.</p>
      <p>“I happen to agree with the chancellor on many things but every policy debate must at its core be intellectually honest,” he added. “For the chancellor to claim that we are all millionaires with no plan is intellectually dishonest and this ain’t the time nor the town for that.”</p>
      <p>Declining diversity in New York City’s eight specialized high schools hit the front pages when DOE enrollment statistics showed that just seven black students <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/18/asian-students-received-most-offers-to-citys-elite-high-schools/">were admitted to Stuyvesant High School</a> this year.</p>
      <p>City Hall proposed scrapping the test, arguing the current admissions setup disadvantages the largely minority student population in the city’s poorer and middle-class neighborhoods, while giving an edge to wealthy — usually white — families.</p>
      <p>But Hizzoner and Carranza got sharp pushback from an unexpected place: the city’s largely working-class Asian American community, whose children account for nearly two-thirds of the students in the specialized schools.</p>
      <p>Overall, the specialized high schools are currently 62 percent Asian, 24 percent white, and 9 percent black and Hispanic.</p>
      <p>They — along with wealthy alum of the specialized high schools, like <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/17/richard-parsons-calls-city-halls-specialized-hs-plan-insulting/">Parson and Lauder</a> — are pushing to keep the test, but boost diversity by adding seats to the specialized high schools, making preparation classes for the entrance exam available for free across the city and improving struggling middle schools.</p>
      <p>They’ve found an ally in state Sen. Leroy Comrie (D-Queens), <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/16/queens-pol-pushing-bill-to-save-specialized-hs-exam/">who is carrying legislation</a> that would require the city to implement a nearly identical plan.</p>
