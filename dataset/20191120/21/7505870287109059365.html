      <h1>Fix the most annoying thing about Apple’s AirPods for $10</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:19:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:19</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>If you have AirPods, you probably love how smart and convenient they are. If you’re behind totally honest though, there’s probably one aspect of Apple’s design that you’re not too happy about. Because the AirPods have smooth plastic tips, they never say secure in your ears like earbuds with silicone tips. Want to fix that without buying new headphones or dealing with bulky covers that don’t fit in the charging case? Check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G26PY8N?tag=b0c55-20">DamonLight Anti-Slip Soft Silicone AirPods Covers</a> on Amazon, which fit all AirPods models other than the new AirPods Pro and only cost $9.99 for two pairs!</p>
