      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cristiano-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> has secretly married his stunning girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez, according to Italian media.</p>
      <p>Italian gossip magazine Novella 2000 claims the couple enjoyed their beautiful big day in Morocco.</p>
      <p>One outlet in Cristiano’s homeland has said his last-known trip to the North African country was in May, sparking speculation they may have wed several months ago but kept it hush hush.</p>
      <p>Novella 2000, which has teased the reveal of more details, quoted a source close to the couple saying: ‘I understood everything on August 29.</p>
      <p>‘That day Cristiano went to Madeira with his lawyers and changed his will to protect Georgina as well. Before that his assets were administered by his mum Dolores.’</p>
      <p>Some Spanish media have also echoed the news, starting an international guessing game as to whether the footballer and his former shop assistant partner are now officially married.</p>

      <p>Georgina, 25, admitted in February she would love to become the 34-year-old’s wife but shut down speculation they were already engaged.</p>

      <p>She told glossy Spanish magazine Hola! he had yet to ask for her hand in marriage</p>
      <p>But she admitted: ‘Every couple wants to get married and I would love to personally.</p>
      <p>‘Right how we have priorities and a lot of responsibilities, although in the future it would be marvellous to become Cristiano’s wife.’</p>
      <p>Cristiano forged his relationship with Georgina during lock-ins at the upmarket clothes store in Madrid where she used to work.</p>
      <p>She soon became his first serious girlfriend since he broke up with Russian beauty Irina Shayk at the start of 2015.</p>
      <p>He moved her into his luxury home on a gated estate on the outskirts of the Spanish capital before setting up home with her in Turin.</p>
      <p>Last year the footballer’s mum said of Georgina during a magazine interview about her son’s love life: ‘She is the mother of my grand-daughter. She is a future daughter-in-law. She’s not my daughter-in-law yet. She’s a future daughter-in-law. She’s a very calm person.’</p>

      <p>Praising his girlfriend and the mother of their daughter Alana, he said: ‘She helped me so much. Of course I’m in love with her.</p>
      <p>‘We’ll be (married) one day, for sure. It’s my mum’s dream as well. So, one day. Why not?</p>
      <p>‘It’s great. She’s my friend. We have conversations. I open the heart for her and she opens the heart for me.’</p>
      <p>Cristiano is also dad to son Cristiano Jr, eight, and two-year-old twins Eva and Mateo.</p>
