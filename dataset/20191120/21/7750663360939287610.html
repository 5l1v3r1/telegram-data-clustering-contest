      <p>After his early withdrawal against AC Milan before the international break, Ronaldo was said to have been left unhappy with the decision of his head coach.</p>
      <p>However, Ronaldo has been able to come through two international fixtures with Portugal unscathed, putting him in a position to feature for Juventus at the weekend.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Tuttosport</i>, the pair are scheduled to hold discussions before the meeting with Atalanta BC in a bid to resolve any lingering differences.</p>
      <p>Despite a number of inconsistent performances from both Ronaldo and Juventus, the Italian champions have remained at the top of the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/serie-a/table.html">Serie A standings</a>.</p>
