      <h1>The 5 Best Trader Joe's Recipes You Need On Your Thanksgiving Table</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:02:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/wc/sarah-regan" target="_blank">RYT 200</a></address>
      <p>We're just one week away from Thanksgiving, and thankfully, Trader Joe's has a foolproof guide to all your meal-prep needs.</p>
      <p>They've got delicious products, recipes, and even a shopping list to make sure your <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/5-types-of-thanksgiving-turkey-for-every-taste-and-budget">Turkey Day</a> dinner goes off without a hitch. Or at least, a hitch that has nothing to do with the food.</p>
      <p>In the spirit of the season, we rounded up five Thanksgiving recipes sure to please, courtesy of Trader Joe's:</p>
      <h3>1. Roasted Brussels sprouts</h3>
      <p>We love Trader Joe's <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/recipes/appetizers-sides/roasted-brussels-sprouts">roasted Brussels sprouts</a> recipe for both its simplicity and complementary flavors. A hint of maple syrup pairs well with the savory, roasted sprouts, and the touch of cranberries adds a little holiday flair, brightening up the table.</p>
      <h3>2. Mini sweet potato biscuits</h3>
      <p>Like the idea of combining two of our favorite carbs in one seasonal recipe? Try these <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/recipes/appetizers-sides/mini-sweet-potato-biscuits">mini sweet potato biscuits</a>. They're hearty, sweet, and even have bits of bacon in them. Yes, please.</p>
      <h3>3. Pumpkin spice mules</h3>
      <p>As the night gets underway, there's nothing like a holiday cocktail to set the tone for a great evening. This <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/recipes/beverages/pumpkin-pie-spiced-mule">pumpkin spice mule</a> recipe is perfect for the <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/friendsgiving-hosting-simple-cozy-ideas-for-your-table-and-decor">friends and family you're entertaining</a> this year. It's a breeze to make and can be easily increased to meet the needs of a dinner party.</p>
      <h3>4. Sausage and kale stuffing</h3>
      <p>A delicious twist on the Thanksgiving staple, Trader Joe's <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/recipes/appetizers-sides/sausage-kale-stuffing">sausage and kale stuffing</a> will have everyone going back for seconds. Made with their Italian pork sausage (sweet or hot), kale, chestnuts, and cheese, the turkey won't be the only one stuffed.</p>
      <h3>5. Pumpkin pie</h3>
      <p>If anyone has room for dessert, Trader Joe's has you covered with their <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/recipes/desserts/easy-as-pumpkin-pie">pumpkin pie</a> recipe. The best part about this pie is that TJ's takes care of the crust, leaving you only to whip up the filling. And with just a 20-minute prep time, it won't take long at all.</p>
      <h3>Don't feel like cooking?</h3>
      <p>We have to give honorary mention to Trader Joe's ready-made Thanksgiving dishes. Let's be real: Not everyone is used to preparing holiday meals for the whole family. If that sounds like you, have no fear.</p>
      <p>TJ's has a ton of products perfect for entertaining. Their <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/5121">One Potato, Two Potato Gratin</a> is sure to be a hit, as is their <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/5145">organic savory vegan gravy</a>. And of course, if you can't brave the pie filling, Trader Joe's does sell <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/5110">prepared pumpkin pies</a>. They even have a guide <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/digin/Post/Post/turkey-roasting-guide">to turkey roasting</a> and a <a href="https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/shopping-list">shopping list</a> to help you get in and out in a breeze.</p>
