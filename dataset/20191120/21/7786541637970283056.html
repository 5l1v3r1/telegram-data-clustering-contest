      <p><b>ANCHORAGE, AlaskaÂ (AP)</b> - If you've ever wanted to own a small bi-weekly newspaper in Alaska but didn't have the money, this could be your chance.</p>
      <p>The publisher of The Skagway News is willing to give the paper away to the right person, if they are willing to move to the southeast Alaska community and be a part of the community.</p>
      <p>Skagway is at the top of the Alaska Panhandle. It has less than a thousand residents, but the town - and the newspaper's bottom line - are helped tremendously with the arrival of about 1 million cruise ship passengers every year.</p>
      <p>Publisher Larry Persily (PU'R-suh-lee) says he's willing to help out the new owners by giving away the paper because the advertising will afford them a salary, but not on top of a mortgage.</p>
