        <b>The body of a man found dead in a burning car in Lucan in Dublin on Monday night has been identified.</b>
      </p>
      <p>DNA tests have confirmed it was that of 42-year-old convicted criminal Wayne Whelan.</p>
      <p>The victim died after being shot a number of times before the car was set alight.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem has been conducted on the body by State pathologist Dr Heide Okker.</p>
      <p>Investigators are appealing for anyone who saw a navy Toyota Corolla - the car which was set alight - in the area to come forward.</p>
      <p>The car had a registration number '05-CW-2225', and it is believed to have been sold on Wednesday November 13th.</p>
      <p>At a press conference earlier, Superintendent Paul Dolan from Lucan Garda Station said: "The body has been identified as that of a male who died as a result of gunshot wounds."</p>

      <p>On the subject of the car, Supt Dolan explained: "I am appealing for any person who has seen this car or knows of its whereabouts since the 13th November to contact investigating Gardaí.</p>
      <p>"I am also appealing to any person in Mount Andrew Estate, who saw this car or to any person who witnessed or has dashcam footage in relation to the incident on Monday night 18th November 2019.</p>
      <p>"To help assist people in their recollection, the Ireland v Denmark international soccer match was taking place at the time".</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is being asked to contact Lucan Garda station on 01-666-7300, the Garda Confidential Line at 1800-666-111 or any Garda station.</p>
