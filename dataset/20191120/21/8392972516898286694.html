      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> have been left divided over Jacqueline Jossa appearing to snap at her campmate Andrew Maxwell.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night's show, Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts got ready to face their Bushtucker trial, Just Desserts.</p>
      <p>Roman said in the Bush Telegraph with Adele: "I'm so happy that we're doing it together because at least if we fail, it’s both of us failing."</p>

      <p>As Ian Wright said they should encourage their fellow campmates to "step up" and do their best, Jacqueline said: "Yeah but I don't think we should put pressure. It doesn't matter if someone had a panic attack and couldn't do it I would eat rice and beans.</p>
      <p>"I was panicking so much yesterday and it didn't make it better people going if you don't even try we're going to get nothing," as she appeared to mimic Andrew's Irish accent.</p>

      <p>"That doesn't make it better.  It makes it ten times worse.  In fact it made me want to go I'm not doing it.  If someone can't do it, they can't do it."</p>
      <aside>I'd just been through a really horrific thing but I didn't want to put pressure on you.</aside>
      <p>Andrew cut in: "Was that was me you were talking about?" to which Jacqueline confirmed it was.</p>
      <p>He hit back: "I'd just been through a really horrific thing but I didn't want to put pressure on you.</p>
      <p>"I won't do that again.  We're all still learning on the job."</p>

      <p>Viewers were divided over Jacqueline's reaction and accused her of mimicking Andrew's Irish accent.</p>
      <p>One person said on Twitter: "Jacqueline is being a tad bitchy I feel... mimicking Andrews accent right in front of him having a moan."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Note to Jacqueline: If you want to [bleep] someone off without obviously singling them out, don’t do the impression of them in their Irish accent."</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Jacqueline is getting on my nerves, what was the point in throwing in that dig to Andrew??? Pull him to the side if there’s an issue, no need to make sly digs in front of the group."</p>
