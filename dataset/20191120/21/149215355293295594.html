      <h1>No one seems to know if the Joker sequel is 'officially' happening</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:09:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/ramisa-rob" target="_blank">Ramisa Rob</a></address>
      <p>A <i>Joker</i> sequel is in the works, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>. But <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a> </i>says that's "flat false" — at least, for now.</p>
      <p>Rumors about a <i>Joker</i> sequel have abounded this week after the blockbuster <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-billion-dollar-global-box-office-1202785920/">raked in $1 billion</a> at the box office. But much of that seemed to be wishful thinking from fans, until <i>THR</i>'s report on Wednesday seemingly revealed that "<i>Joker</i> director Todd Phillips headed into Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich's office" on Oct. 7, and "proposed an outsized idea — the rights to develop a portfolio of DC characters' origin stories." The report also added that Joaquin Phoenix and Phillips are "likely to reteam" for the antihero flick's sequel.</p>

      <p>But <i>Deadline </i>is countering <i>THR</i>'s report and citing multiple sources who say "no such October 7 meeting between Phillips and Emmerich occurred, and that Phillips hasn't even considered overseeing other DC character films." There are currently "no deals for a sequel, nor even any negotiations with director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver to craft one," <i>Deadline</i>'s sources say.</p>
      <p>While the conflicting reporting leaves unclear whether the sequel is "officially" coming soon, most agree that it's probably happening. Just as <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878603/joaquin-phoenix-down-joker-sequel">Phoenix is game for a sequel</a>, Warner Bros. will surely welcome the deal, so "no one is saying a <i>Joker</i> sequel won't happen someday," <i>Deadline </i>carefully notes.</p>
