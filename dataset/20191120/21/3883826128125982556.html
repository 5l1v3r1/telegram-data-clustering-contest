      <p>Commuter Sophie King told BBC London she was travelling south on the Victoria Line when the train began pulling into Oxford Circus.</p>
      <p>"It was very crowded and then everyone started screaming and shouting and calling for a doctor," she said.</p>
      <p>"It looked like the man was crushed at the side of the train."</p>

      <p>BBC cricket commentator Ebony Rainford-Brent was also among the witnesses to the incident.</p>
      <p>She said she saw a man fall in front of a train as people filled the "overcrowded" platform.</p>
      <p>"I just watched a man fall under the tube two metres in front of me," she said.</p>
      <p>"As the train was coming in he was at the very front... it looked like he swivelled and lost his balance, it looked like a fall.</p>
      <p>"He sort of fell on his back. The way it looked to me he could have almost froze.</p>
      <p>"[It] was honestly the most horrific thing to witness."</p>
