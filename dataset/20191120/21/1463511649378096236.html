      <p>The Nigerian Air Force has neutralised some Islamic State of West Africa Province leaders and destroyed their meeting venue at Jubillaram in the Northern part of Borno.</p>
      <p>Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said the operation was conducted on Tuesday through the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE.</p>
      <p>“The operation was executed yesterday, November 19, sequel to intelligence reports indicating that some top ISWAP leaders had assembled for a meeting at a compound within the settlement, which they also used to store some of their logistics supplies.</p>
      <p>“Accordingly, the ATF dispatched a Nigerian Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance platform as well as fighter jets to attack the location.</p>
      <p>“Overhead the target area, several terrorists were observed around some buildings in the middle of the settlement.</p>
      <p>“These fighters were neutralised in successive strikes by the attack aircraft as they attempted flee the location.</p>
      <p>“The air strikes also led to the destruction of some terrorists’ structures, including one of their logistics stores, which was seen engulfed in flames,” he said.</p>
      <p>Daramola said the NAF, operating in concert with surface forces, would sustain its efforts to completely destroy all remnants of the terrorists in the North East. </p>
