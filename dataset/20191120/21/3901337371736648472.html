      <p>The 34-year-old returned to his club following a successful international break that saw him score four goals to help Portugal secure qualification for the 2020 UEFA European Championship.</p>
      <p>The next edition of the tournament will be Ronaldo's fifth Euro and many eyes will be on the defending champions once again.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo's Juventus teammate Danilo, though, caused some commotion in his home country after revealing the Portugal captain told him he would have won five World Cups if he had played for Brazil.</p>

      <p>"I am Portuguese and with a lot of pride. I have won the Euro (2016) and the Nations League with Portugal, so I am very proud of it," Ronaldo told <i>Eurosport</i> when asked about Danilo's comments.</p>
      <p>"I would not swap my nationality by any chance.</p>
      <p>"I am happy for him to say that because he is talking about about Brazil, one of the best teams in the world.</p>
      <p>"Portugal is not among the best teams in the world, at least not within the top three, but we can beat any team (on a given day)."</p>
