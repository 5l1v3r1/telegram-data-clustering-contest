      <h1>Democrat Tax Hike Plans Would Hit Millions of Americans, Not Just The Ultra-Wealthy | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>The proposals by Democratic presidential hopefuls to tax the wealth of billionaires have received a lot of attention.</h2>

      <p>But it is their plans to hike payroll taxes that would have the biggest impact on voters.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Warren and other leading Democrats have said that they would impose a stiff payroll tax hike on higher-income families. In Warren’s proposal, she would impose a 14.8 percent payroll tax on workers with incomes above $250,000.</p>
      <p>Currently, Social Security payroll taxes amount to 12.4 percent for incomes up to $132,900. Incomes above that level are not taxed and do not contribute to a worker’s future Social Security benefits.</p>
      <p>Warren’s plan would have the tax kick back in on incomes above $250,000. And the rate would rise to 14.8 percent. Like the current tax, this would be split between the employee and the employer.</p>
      <p>If the wealth tax is a “billionaires tax,” this would be a “hundred-thousandaires tax.” It would hit the pocketbooks of around 5 million households.</p>
      <p>The tax on higher incomes would not result in higher benefits. Breaking with its roots as an earned entitlement, Social Security would become a wealth transfer system.</p>
      <p>“The result would be a large tax increase on high earners, even before other changes a Democratic administration might contemplate, such as increasing income tax rates or taxes on investment income,” <i>New York Times </i>writer Neil Irwin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/upshot/democrats-tax-affluent-warren.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;module=inline">explains</a>. “The top earners facing new Social Security taxes would not see their future benefits rise commensurately; rather it would amount to a transfer from high earners to low- and middle-income Social Security recipients.”</p>
      <p>This could cause some political trouble for Warren and other advocates of payroll tax hikes because the higher taxes would be paid disproportionately<b> </b>in Democratic-leaning states<b>,</b> according to data from Moody’s. Irwin describes the tax proposals as “a test of what affluent liberals are willing to sacrifice to accomplish progressive goals.”</p>
      <p>According to Warren’s tax plans, high-income households would also be hit by a 14.8 percent tax on investment incomes. This tax would apply to individuals with incomes above $250,000 or households with incomes above $400,000.</p>
