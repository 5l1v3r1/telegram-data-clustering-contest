      <p>Michael Gove has revealed he left Cabinet colleagues baffled when he used the Scots word “scunnered” in a Downing Street meeting.</p>
      <p>He was campaigning north of the border on the day a poll revealed the most popular Scots words.</p>
      <p>Dreich saw off competition from other Scots words including braw, glaikit and scunnered to be named as the “most iconic Scots word” by the Scottish Book Trust.</p>

      <p>Mr Gove, who was brought up in Aberdeen, revealed his favourite Scots words are clamjamfry and scunnered.</p>
      <p>He said he had used “scunnered” – which means annoyed, discontented or bored – in the Cabinet, adding his colleague Scottish Secretary Alister Jack “knew what I was talking about”.</p>
      <p>But he added he was “not sure if any of the others did”.</p>
      <p>Mr Gove said clamjamfry was a “marvellous word meaning a riot of noise”.</p>
      <p>But the Dictionary of the Scots Language said it was used to describe a “company of people” and was generally used “contemptuously” to describe a “mob, rabble, the riff-raff of a community”.</p>
