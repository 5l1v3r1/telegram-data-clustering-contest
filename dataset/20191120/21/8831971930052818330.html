      <h1>Emilia Clarke Pressured to Appear Nude in Upcoming Roles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:01:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/shivanisx17/" target="_blank">Shivani Singh</a></address>
      <p>Emilia Clarke is best known for her role as Khaleesi on “Game of Thrones.” Playing this character meant that Clarke often appeared nude in many scenes, however after Season 1 of the show, she took control over how much of her body she wanted to show.</p>
      <p>Now that the hit HBO series has come to an end, many producers have approached Clarke requesting nudity in upcoming projects. Just because she appeared naked in scenes for “GOT”, Clarke says she’s not falling for these producers’ requests.</p>
      <p>In a <u><a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/emilia-clarke">recent episode</a></u> of Dax Shepard’s “Armchair Expert” podcast, Clarke said “I’m a lot savvier with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing. I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, ‘No, the sheet stays up,’ and they’re like, ‘You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans.’ And I’m like, ‘Fuck you.'”</p>
      <p>Clarke admitted that there was “fuck ton of nudity” in the first season of “Game of Thrones.”  She went through with it because she was a brand new actress with no prior experience in film or TV sets. She was nervous about being a newbie. Clarke explained, “I’d come fresh from drama school, and I approached [it] as a job – if it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed, this is what this is and I’m gonna make sense of it…Everything’s gonna be cool.”</p>
      <p>With more and more nude scenes headed her way, she began to question it: “I’m floating through this first season and I have no idea what I’m doing; I have no idea what any of this is,” she said. “I’ve never been on a film set like this before, I’d been on a film set twice before then, and I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do, and I don’t know what’s expected of me, and I don’t know what you want, and I don’t know what I want. Regardless of there being nudity or not, I would have spent that first season thinking I’m not worthy of requiring anything; I’m not worthy of needing anything at all.”</p>
      <p>Clarke <u><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/entertainment/emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones-trnd/index.html">also revealed</a></u> that her fellow “Game Of Thrones” co-star Jason Momoa encouraged her to voice her thoughts when the nudity scenes felt unnecessary on the show and on any other outside project that she may work on.</p>
      <p>It’s great to see Clarke standing up for herself and rejecting these uncalled for scenes as she grows and progresses as an actress.</p>
