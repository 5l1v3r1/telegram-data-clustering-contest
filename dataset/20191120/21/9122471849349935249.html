      <h1>Initial Betting Line Set For Georgia-LSU Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:10:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, the Georgia Bulldogs clinched a spot in the SEC title game with a win over Auburn. Kirby Smart and company close out the regular season with Texas A&amp;M and Georgia Tech before taking the field for the conference title.</p>
      <p>Their opponent isn’t set in stone just yet, but it looks like the LSU Tigers will emerge from the SEC West.</p>
      <p>LSU faces off against Arkansas and Texas A&amp;M over the final two weeks of the regular season. If the tigers win those games, Ed Orgeron’s team will be in the SEC title game.</p>
      <p>So, what would happen between LSU and Georgia? Well, Caesar’s released an early line that suggests the Tigers will emerge victorious.</p>
      <p>According to Caesars, LSU would open as a 3.5-point favorite over Georgia.</p>

      <p>LSU would have to lose its final two games to miss out on the conference title game after taking care of Alabama earlier this season. It’s safe to say the Tigers are a near-lock to face the Bulldogs in the title game.</p>
      <p>LSU quarterback Joe Burrow is firmly in the Heisman race and is being talked about as a possible No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft. He won’t have an easy path to the College Football Playoff, though, as the Bulldogs boast one of the best defenses in college football.</p>
