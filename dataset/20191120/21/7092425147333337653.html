        <b>The funds will be issued to pay-as-you-go customers as a result of the phone provider failing to comply with EU regulations</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vodafone has been ordered by Ireland's communication regulator ComReg to cough up a total of €416,972.</p>
      <p>The sum will be refunded to 72,774 pay-as-you-go customers due to Vodafone failing to comply with European Union regulations.</p>
      <p>The communications watchdog found that Vodafone failed to supply its customers with sufficient information over its “Extra” Pay as You Go product between the period of September 2016 and March 2018.</p>
      <p>The mobile phone operator's blunder led to a situation where customers topping up their accounts by the monthly tariff price of €20 or €30 during the 28-day period were unaware that it would lead to their accounts being reset.</p>
      <p>The reset would lead to customers missing out on any remaining allowances and a new cycle would begin.</p>
      <p>ComReg has accepted a written commitment from Vodafone following their investigation.</p>
      <p>Vodafone will refund 72,774 customers who may have not intended to reset their offer upon topping up.</p>
      <p>The company will also advise customers in their contract at the point of sale that their offer will reset if the customer tops up by the amount of the offer.</p>
      <p>Amendments will be made to text messages sent to customers who have topped up to clearly state their offer has been reset.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Vodafone confirmed they worked closely with ComReg on the investigation.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Vodafone said:</p>
      <p>"Following discussions with ComReg, Vodafone revised certain offer communications and have agreed to apply credits to those customers impacted."</p>
