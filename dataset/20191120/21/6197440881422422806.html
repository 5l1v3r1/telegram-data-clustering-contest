      <h1>Here’s what Google Stadia games we’re playing so far — how about you? [Poll]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:52:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia just went live this week, and <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/19/stadia-founders-invite-codes-not-arriving/">by some miracle</a>, most of the <i>9to5Google</i> team already have their codes to play. It’s only been a mere 24 hours so far, but there are a handful of titles we’re playing already. What Google Stadia games are you playing?</p>
      <h3>What games we’re playing on Google Stadia</h3>
      <p>The title we’re playing most so far on Stadia is, as you might expect, <i>Destiny 2</i>. The game comes free for every Stadia subscriber so far, which means the cost of entry is nothing on top of your initial investment. Our Kyle Bradshaw, Abner Li, and Damien Wilde have been playing so far with no complaints.</p>
      <p>Kyle is the resident <i>Destiny</i> nut, and he says he’s been satisfied with the game on Stadia so far. His first impression was that playing Destiny on Stadia felt much better than his time testing out <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/18/microsoft-xcloud-hands-on/">Microsoft’s xCloud</a> with Halo 5. He’s also <a href="https://twitter.com/SkylledDev/status/1197253788022775808">been able to play</a> the game via Chromecast and a Pixelbook using Google’s Stadia controller.</p>
      <p>He’ll have much more to share later today in his first impressions post. Stay tuned for that.</p>

      <p>Abner also spent a bit of time playing <i>Destiny 2</i>, but with a different setup. He ended up playing on a hotspot that resulted in a choppy but still playable experience. Google technically doesn’t allow playing Stadia games on LTE, but since he was using a hotspot on a phone other than his Pixel, things worked out.</p>
      <p>Personally, I’m not much of a shooter person, so <i>Destiny</i> wasn’t my cup of tea. Instead, I picked up two different titles: <i>GRID</i> and <i>Trials Rising</i>. I’ve only given the latter a few short minutes of playtime, but I’ve spent a good bit playing <i>GRID,</i> and so far I’m very happy with the experience. Input lag feels nonexistent, and the quality of the game has been solid on my Windows PC and my Pixel 4 XL, too. I can’t wait to try things out with the Stadia Controller and a Chromecast Ultra tomorrow.</p>
