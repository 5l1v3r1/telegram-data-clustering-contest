      <h1>Crash Bandicoot Fans Are Really Reaching with This Delusional PS4 'Leak'</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Sony posted a video entitled “It’s Time to Play” earlier this month.</li>
        <li>Fans of Crash Bandicoot have used the video as a basis for rumors of a new entry into the series.</li>
        <li>Those delusional fans are really just reaching for any information surrounding a new Crash game.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Waiting for a new entry in your favorite series is tough. That’s why it’s easy to get taken in by baseless rumors and end up believing in projects that never existed in the first place. That is precisely what is going on in the Crash Bandicoot fan base right about now.</p>
      <p>Back on Nov. 4, Sony released the ‘It’s Time to Play’ video. It’s basically a light-hearted ad showing off PlayStation’s recognizable brands. Based almost entirely on a few frames of said video, Crash Bandicoot fans think there is a new game coming out.</p>

      <h3>There Is Practically No Real Evidence That a New Crash Bandicoot Game Is Coming</h3>
      <p>The frames in question mainly revolve around a scene featuring characters from Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled. Characters are seen driving around the streets, many of them accompanied by tribal masks. One of the masks in the scene is unlike any we’ve ever seen, and that’s why they believe there’s a new game on its way.</p>

      <p>There is <b>slightly </b>more to the rumors than that, technically. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/crash_bandicoot_buses_invade_britain">Crash Bandicoot buses have begun popping up around the UK</a>. They feature a rendering of Crash unlike any used in the recent remake of the classic PS1 titles, which has prompted speculation that it is from the new game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/FromHappyRock">Nicholas Kole, an artist for Crash developer Toys for Bob</a>, hasn’t squashed the “leak” rumors. When someone tweeted about the mask from the video, <a href="https://twitter.com/FromHappyRock/status/1191410102470877185">he responded with a thinking face emoji</a>. Once again, people took this as a sign that a new Crash Bandicoot game would be coming out soon.</p>
      <h3>Maybe It’s True, But Don’t Get Your Hopes Up</h3>
      <p>The final piece of evidence comes straight from 4chan and is, therefore, of dubious reliability. They <b>do </b>sometimes provide accurate leaks, such as with Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, but it’s always totally unverifiable. This bit of info even provides a name, Crash Bandicoot Worlds.</p>

        <figcaption>Not only is it easy to post whatever you like on 4chan, but on top of that, this was posted 11 days after the video went live. Plenty of time for someone to get bored and post a fake “leak” for giggles. | Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanPS88/status/1196193164358537220">Twitter</a></figcaption>

      <p>Firstly, let’s hope that’s not the name; it sounds painfully generic. Secondly, while the information sounds reasonable enough, remember that it comes from a site where anyone can post anything anonymously. The picture used isn’t even some previously unseen image from somewhere to prove authenticity.</p>
      <p>Again, that is not to say that it might not all be true, but try your best not to get excited. It might never happen, and you’re just going to disappoint yourself. We’ve really not got much of a reason to think we’re getting Crash Bandicoot 8 anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Besides, isn’t it more likely that that mask is just from <a href="https://www.ccn.com/crash-team-racing-needs-to-chill-the-fck-out-with-grand-prix-events/">an upcoming Grand Prix in Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled? </a></p>
