      <h1>Wall Street close: Benchmarks suffer losses partly due to trade deal pessimism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:05:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>DJIA unofficially closed down 121.49 points, or 0.43%, at 27,812.53.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>S&amp;P 500 unofficially closed down 13.22 points, or 0.42%, at 3,106.96.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NASDAQ unofficially closed down 49.41 points, or 0.58%, at 8,521.24.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Benchmarks on Wall Street were closing lower on Wednesday following reports from Reuters that a trade deal with China might not be secured before 2020. Subsequently, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">risk appetite</a> declined and stocks sunk. The report by Reuters, entitled "Phase One US-China trade deal may not be completed this year - trade sources, reminded traders that the efforts to nail down the first phase of a broader deal are indeed stalling. </p>
      <h3>Official closes</h3>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, lost 114 points lower, or 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 12 points, 0.4%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq, which closed at an all-time high the prior day,  lost around 44 points, ending down 0.5%. However, the benchmarks were ending off their Reuters-report-lows. On the upside of the market's events on Wednesday, we did have some stellar earnings results from retailers such as Target Corp and Lowe's Cos.</p>
      <h3>FOMC minutes</h3>
      <p>There was a muted reaction to the minutes that came in line with expectations which came with the key notes as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most judged level now appropriate barring a 'material' reassessment of the outlook.</li>
        <li>'A couple' said Fed should reinforce statement with communications that another rate cut unlikely without signs of a 'significant slowdown'.</li>
        <li>Many said rate cut warranted due to global weakness and trade uncertainty.</li>
        <li>Some favored keeping rates steady and argued outlook was favorable and inflation expected to rise.</li>
        <li>A couple supported rate cut but said it was a close call.</li>
        <li>Several concerned some banks had reduced capital buffers when the should be rising.</li>
        <li>Discussed that risks to the economic outlook remained tilted to the downside.</li>
      </ul>
