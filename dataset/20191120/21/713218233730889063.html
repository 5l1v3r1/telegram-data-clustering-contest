      <h1>Two charged after cannabis plants worth $3m found near Coffs</h1>

      <p>Two men will appear in court after police seized more than $3 million worth of cannabis plants at a rural property on the state's north coast.</p>
      <p>Detectives from the State Crime Command's Drug and Firearms Squad established Strike Force Hyperion to investigate the cultivation of cannabis across NSW.</p>
      <p>Their inquiries uncovered a property near Coffs Harbour using a large industrial grow house to cultivate cannabis.</p>
      <p>Following extensive inquiries, Strike Force Hyperion investigators, with assistance from Coffs/Clarence Police District, the Rural Crime Prevention Team, and Coffs Harbour Region Enforcement Squad, arrested two men - aged 26 and 31 - at a rural property at Korora, about 10am yesterday.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, a crime scene warrant was executed at the property where investigators seized about 1030 cannabis plants, with an estimated potential street value of more than $3 million, and about 50kg of cannabis head, with an estimated potential street value of $330,000.</p>
      <p>After dismantling the large setup, investigators also seized hydroponic, electrical, and lighting equipment, as well as chemicals.</p>
      <p>The two men were taken to Coffs Harbour Police Station and charged with supplying a prohibited drug in commercial quantity and cultivating a prohibited plant in large commercial quantity.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old man was also charged with an outstanding warrant for cultivating a prohibited plant (commercial quantity), which relate to hydroponic setups located at a Burwood home in March 2018 and a Toongabbie home in November 2018.</p>
      <p>They were both refused bail to appear at Coffs Harbour Local Court today.</p>
      <p>Drug and Firearms Squad Commander, Detective Acting Superintendent Michael Cook, said criminals using regional NSW to grow crops will not go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>"We found a sophisticated industrial greenhouse setup at this remote property which was being used to make a profit from a large commercial cannabis crop," Det A/Supt Cook said.</p>
      <p>"We know from experience that criminal syndicates will often re-invest profits made from the cultivation and supply of cannabis into other illicit enterprises."</p>
      <p>
