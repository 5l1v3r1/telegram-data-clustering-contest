        <b>SCOTLAND fans could face a scramble for tickets if they reach the Euro 2020 play-off final.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Steve Clarke's side</a> are set to host the semi-final at Hampden in March against one of Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania.</p>

      <p>Should they win on the night, they will then take on the winner of the game between Norway and Serbia for a place in next summer's finals.</p>
      <p>However, it won't be known until the draw this Friday whether a potential final for Scotland would be played at home or away.</p>
      <p>And that could lead to a scramble for tickets with the Tartan Army potentially only having 1,400 briefs available to them.</p>
      <p>Uefa have confirmed to <i>SunSport</i> that as the play-offs are a continuation of the qualifiers, regular host nation rules apply.</p>

      <p>That means only as little as five per cent of tickets need to be allocated to away supporters.</p>
      <p>If Scotland reach the final and be drawn away against the winner of the clash between Norway and Serbia, this means as little as 1,400 briefs could be up for grabs.</p>
      <p>That figure refers to the 28,000-capacity Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo where Norway play their home games.</p>
      <p>If the Tartan Army were forced to travel to Serbia, they would have at least a slightly improved 2,777 tickets available to them at the 55,538-capacity Rajko Mitic Stadium in Belgrade.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Russia could be banned from Euro 2020 over doping allegations - and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4975521/scotland-denmark-euro-2020-russia-doping/">Scotland could take their place</a>.</p>
      <p>Uefa haven't stated who would replace the world's largest nation at the tournament if they are banned.</p>
      <p>But it is worth noting that Denmark famously profited from Yugoslavia not being allowed to participate at Euro 92 due to being in a state of civil war.</p>
      <p>Like Scotland finishing third behind Russia in our qualifying group, the Danes also finished behind the former Balkan nation in their qualifiers that year.</p>
