      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> is set to introduce a new official camping area for 2020 in a bid to reduce waste left onsite.</p>
      <p>The Sticklinch campsite will be located in the former West Campervan Fields area at next year’s 50th anniversary event, offering “unpretentious, custom-made and pre-erected accommodation” for those hoping to travel light.</p>

      <p>Podpads, yurts and bell tents, alongside Glastonbury’s “signature scout-style tents” will be available to guests. Organisers say Skticklinch will give punters “a more gently undulating walk to the festival site, ideal for those who find the climb to Worthy View challenging.”</p>
      <p>Though festivalgoers will be able to park their cars in a nearby adjacent field, Glastonbury encourages people to travel via public transport as they continue in their efforts to be as green as possible.</p>
      <p>Those looking to book the new accommodation can expect to pay £325 for a two-person scout tent, or up to £1,150 for a six-person octopod. A yurt suitable for four people will cost £850.</p>
