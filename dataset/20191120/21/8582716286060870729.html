      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>Actress Erika Sawajiri, arrested for allegedly possessing the synthetic drug MDMA, has tested negative in a urine test for MDMA and other illegal drugs, police said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>After she was arrested last week, the 33-year-old told investigators that she obtained MDMA from an acquaintance a few weeks ago at a nightclub and admitted to taking the drug, also called Ecstasy.</p>
      <p>MDMA usually goes out of a person's system within two to three days after taking it, and Sawajiri took the test on a voluntary basis on Saturday, the day she was arrested, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.</p>
      <p>The police are trying to trace how she obtained drugs by analyzing data in a confiscated mobile phone, among other steps.</p>
      <p>Sawajiri was quoted as telling investigators, "I first used illegal drugs more than 10 years ago, and I also used marijuana, LSD, and cocaine," according to the police.</p>
      <p>The police searched her home in Tokyo on Saturday morning when she returned after a night out at a club in the Shibuya shopping and nightlife district, and found 0.09 gram of powder containing MDMA.</p>
      <p>She did not have any illegal drugs in her possession when she came home.</p>
      <p>MDMA is a popular street drug especially among young people.</p>
      <p>Sawajiri was cast to play the role of 16th-century Japanese warlord Oda Nobunaga's wife in public broadcaster NHK's historical drama series "Kirin ga Kuru" in 2020.</p>
