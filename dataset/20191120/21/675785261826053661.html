      <h1>What Lille sporting director Luis Campos has said about reuniting with Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been named as Mauricio Pochettino's successor at Tottenham, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal with the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:55:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho's former right-hand man, Luis Campos, is reportedly keen on linking up with the Portuguese manager at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> .</p>
      <p>Mourinho, 56, has been named as Mauricio Pochettino's successor, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal at the north London club.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese, who has been out of work since losing his job at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> last December, inherits a squad that are languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, having taken 14 points from their 12 games.</p>
      <p>Mourinho moved quickly to appoint his backroom staff, with Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos joining from Lille as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach, respectively.</p>

      <p>And now <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11865889/luis-campos-open-to-joining-jose-mourinho-at-tottenham-as-sporting-director">Sky Sports</a> has claimed that Lille chief Campos, who was Mourinho's assistant manager at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , is open to taking up a sporting director role with the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Caplehorn is currently in the role of director of football, with chief scout Steve Hitchen and chairman Daniel Levy also taking a leading role in transfers.</p>
      <p>But it was only last month that Campos opened up on a potential reunion with Mourinho.</p>
      <p>He said: "Mourinho is like a brother to me.</p>

      <p>"I know him very well and for a long time. He's a wonderful person and the best coach in the world. So, of course, if he called me I would speak.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion - football needs someone like Jose. Football needs this special coach with this energy and strong personality. I believe the next work of Jose will be his top work."</p>
      <p>Soon after Mourinho's appointment, Tottenham also confirmed the arrival of Carlos Lalin as fitness coach, Ricardo Formosinho as tactical analyst and Giovanni Cerra as technical analyst.</p>
      <p>All three worked under Mourinho at Old Trafford.</p>
