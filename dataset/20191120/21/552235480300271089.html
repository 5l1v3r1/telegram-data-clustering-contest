      <h1>The Jose Mourinho alternate universe as Special One replaces Craig Levein at Hearts</h1>
      <h2>We've taken a trip to an alternate reality to find out what would happen if the Special One took over at Tynecastle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:03:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>The football world went into meltdown this morning when <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> was confirmed as the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>The Special One had been out of work since leaving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> last season, but was confirmed as the new Spurs boss just hours after Mauricio Pochettino had been sacked.</p>
      <p>That job was only vacant for a very brief period of time, but north of the border <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> are still searching for a new boss of their own.</p>
      <p>Could Mourinho have filled that role? Well, probably not, but what if he had?</p>
      <p>Fortunately <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>was able to nip over to an alternate dimension to find out exactly how it would have gone, and we brought back some entries from Jose's diary with us...</p>

      <h3>Monday November 18</h3>
      <p>Dear diary,</p>
      <p>I'm getting very bored with gambling adverts and punditry. Sure, the constant worry that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/roy-keane">Roy Keane</a> will rip your throat out with his teeth live on Super Sunday gets the adrenaline going but it doesn't compare to the rush that comes with ruining everyone else's Super Sunday with an attritional 1-0 win over a direct rival.</p>
      <p>The Bayern Munich job has come and gone, Real Madrid are stubbornly refusing to sack Zinedine Zidane and even Arsenal haven't returned my calls.</p>
      <p>I just can't understand it, it's not like I've called their most legendary manager a "voyeur" or a "specialist in failure" or anything.</p>

      <p>I'm going to have to take drastic measures, diary - I'm going for an interview at Hearts.</p>
      <p>Some may consider Scottish football to be below a man of my abilities and I thank them for their respect. Respect. Respect.</p>
      <p>The truth is though that I was very close to going to Celtic in the summer, that definitely happened and you can tell that because I'm writing it here in my totally real and not made up diary.</p>
      <p>Ok diary, that's enough for now - I need to research who or what a Hamilton Academical is.</p>

      <p>Dear diary,</p>
      <p>What a welcome I've had in Scotland! As soon as I stepped off the train I saw a load of people drinking something called Special Brew, which I can only assume is some sort of craft ale named after everybody's favourite Special One.</p>
      <p>Already I feel appreciated. In England they called me "surly" but here in this land called Gorgie the general consensus seemed to be that I am dangerously flamboyant and perhaps overly cheery.</p>
      <p>I made my way to my meeting with Ann Budge, though I was slightly late as her directions were a trifle confusing.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>"When... you get... off the train make sure to turn... left... at... Haymarket," she told me, but I'd still probably have made the meeting on time had it not been for a strange bespectacled man who seemingly deliberately gave me the wrong directions.</p>
      <p>Diary, I'm probably being paranoid, but I'm sure I saw that same man with his nose pressed up against the window during my interview. I'm almost certain he tried to trip me up as I left.</p>
      <p>When I pointed this out he didn't have the good grace to apologise, just described it as "a good laugh".</p>
      <p>Still, I think I did enough to impress. In fact, I got the distinct impression I'm going to be installed as the king of some kind of Tyne Castle. Commuting from Newcastle might prove difficult, but it'll beat living in a Manchester hotel for three years.</p>

      <p>Dear diary,</p>
      <p>Today I was officially confirmed as the new manager of Hearts! There was something of a last-minute hitch as someone had stolen all the pens so I couldn't sign my contract.</p>
      <p>Was it the bespectacled man, who I saw running into his office with some strangely pointy objects under his sensible jumper? I prefer not to speak. If I speak I am in big trouble, judging by the pointed glare this strange apparition gave me as he closed the door behind him.</p>
      <p>As you know, diary, I try to get the upper hand in every press conference, and I'm not going to tone it down just because it's my presentation.</p>
      <p>Some of the journalists flagged slightly at the end of my 90-minute video presentation detailing how my Chelsea team denied Steven Gerrard the league title with Liverpool but I think the rude drawings of Neil Lennon I distributed to everyone got the message across.</p>

      <p>Dear diary,</p>
      <p>First training session went well. The lads seemed very enthusiastic about getting to train with a ball rather than running up and down a hill until they vomit. I assured them I'd never inflict such a barbaric regime on my players. Except Luke Shaw. Must remember to undermine him from afar in my next press conference.</p>
      <p>The international players will be back tomorrow and I must take the chance to ask them about the man with glasses, who stood on the sideline heckling my every drill. I asked the strange shaggy-haired chap in the AM tracksuit to escort the heckler from the premises but he just muttered something about being "on the board".</p>

      <p>Dear diary,</p>
      <p>The international players were back today - including that Steven Naismith character who once scored a hat-trick against my Chelsea.</p>
      <p>I think he tried to introduce himself to me but to be honest I couldn't understand a word he said - it was mainly shouting and pointing.</p>
      <p>I congratulated him on managing to extend his career into his 50s but Christophe Berra told me that's just what people from Stewarton look like.</p>
      <p>The early signs are positive though, I like the look of this squad. Tall centre-backs, tall midfielders, a tall striker - just what I'm looking for. Whoever assembled this team is a man after my own heart.</p>
      <p>Ryotaro Meshino showed some flashes of skill in today's session, must remember to drill that out of him. Maybe I'll turn him into a wing-back.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Dear diary,</p>
      <p>We had our first game today - and we won!</p>
      <p>My opposite number was Angelo Alessio, who I remember well from being Antonio Conte's assistant. I hate Antonio Conte.</p>
      <p>I may have been sent to the stands for poking him in the eye, but we managed to grind out a 1-0 win with Uche Ikpeazu scoring the winner.</p>
      <p>Already some of the media are accusing me of parking the bus, but that's not the strangest reaction I've had.</p>

      <p>After the final whistle the bespectacled man thrust an envelope into my hand which I'm pretty sure contained some foul substance.</p>
      <p>I asked why he'd give me such a horrible letter but all he said was: "Oops, that's for Michael Stewart" and handed me another letter.</p>
      <p>Diary, I've just opened the letter and I can't make any sense of it. I think he's criticising my style but it simply says the following: "Call that parking the bus? You played a striker. CL."</p>
      <p>I don't think this CL likes me very much, but I'm sure I can win him round with my sunny personality. Perhaps I'll get some of that foul-smelling stuff from him - I still have Luke Shaw's address.</p>
