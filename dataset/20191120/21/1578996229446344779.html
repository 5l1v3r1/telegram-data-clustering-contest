      <h1>Ariana Grande Could Not Love Bernie Sanders Any Harder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:31:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Ariana Grande felt the Bern last night, and Bernie Sanders got to publicly declare he's an Arianator. The singer and U.S. senator and Democratic presidential nominee spent time together at her Atlanta concert, and they were clearly legitimately happy to meet.</p>
      <p>They of course took photos <i>and</i> had the best things to say about each other. Grande posted first, sharing two shots of herself with Sanders. "MY GUY. thank you Senator Sanders for coming to my show, making my whole night and for all that you stand for !!!" she captioned her Instagram. "@headcountorg and i are doing our best to make you proud. we’ve already registered 20k+ young voters at my shows and more online and we aren’t stopping any time soon. proud of my fans for paying attention and getting involved. we adore you! also... i will never smile this hard again." (Grande has been registering voters at all of her shows, via her Thank U Next Gen initiative.)</p>

      <p>Sanders then tweeted the photo and high praise for Miss Grande. "I want to thank <a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande">@ArianaGrande</a> for not only being a wonderful entertainer, but also for being such an outstanding advocate for social justice. We must all be prepared–like Ariana has shown–to fight for everyone who is struggling. It was great to meet her in Atlanta last night," he wrote on his Twitter.</p>

      <p>Grande also had <a href="http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29856582/ariana-grande-matt-bennett-elizabeth-gillies-atlanta-concert-reunion/">a <i>Victorious </i>reunion on stage</a> at that Atlanta show with Matt Bennett and Elizabeth Gillies, so Sanders got to take in a real special concert.</p>
