      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Attorney General Josh Kaul says testing is finally finished on thousands of unanalyzed sexual assault evidence kits.</p>
      <p>Kaul Wednesday testing was finished on all 4,471 kits designated for analysis. The state Justice Department started analyzing the kits in 2016. Testing has resulted in a dozen criminal cases so far.</p>
      <p>Kaul also announced Wisconsin has won a $1.8 million federal grant to continue investigating cases related to the testing and fund a kit tracking system.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of sexual assault evidence kits have gone untested in the United States for a variety of reasons. Prosecutors may have decided a case was too weak to pursue or been forced to drop cases because victims won't cooperate.</p>
      <p>Victim advocates have been pushing since 2014 to analyze the kits to identify serial offenders.</p>
