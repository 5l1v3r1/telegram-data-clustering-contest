      <h1>After False Drug Test, He Was in Solitary Confinement for 120 Days</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:10:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jan Ransom</a></address>
      <p>Michael Kearney could not understand how he had tested positive for drugs. He stared in disbelief at the corrections officers in an upstate New York prison where he was serving time. Though he had once been addicted to crack cocaine, he had been clean for two years.</p>
      <p>Yet the corrections officers had arrived with handcuffs, saying a urine test showed that Mr. Kearney had used a prescription painkiller. Prison officials gave him 120 days in solitary confinement just a week before he was supposed to be released. It took officials seven months to realize the test results were wrong, he said.</p>
      <p>“I think about it every day,” Mr. Kearney, 50, said in a phone interview this week. “Where I could have been.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kearney is one of hundreds of New York State prisoners who say they were punished after tests falsely determined they had used drugs, according to a federal class-action lawsuit filed on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Many of the inmates spent months in solitary confinement or locked in cells. Others were denied release on parole, removed from programs, or held beyond their scheduled release dates after testing positive for narcotics, according to the complaint filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn.</p>
      <p>The plaintiffs, who include former and current inmates, claim that the manufacturer of the drug-testing equipment used in the prisons — Microgenics Corporation and its parent company, Thermo Fisher Scientific — failed to ensure that its devices produced accurate results.</p>
      <p>State prison officials and the state inspector general are investigating the matter.</p>
      <p>The state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision has begun reviewing tests taken this year that came back positive for the opioids Suboxone and buprenorphine, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Thomas Mailey, a spokesman for the department, said the prisons had stopped using the Microgenics equipment after learning that results were inaccurate. They “immediately reversed any actions taken as a result of these tests, and restored privileges to any potentially affected inmates,” he said, adding that prison officials were preparing a lawsuit against the manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Prisoner advocates said the prison system had reversed some guilty findings, reinstated educational and recreational programming for inmates who had been removed from it, and released some people who were being held longer because of faulty tests. Mr. Mailey declined to say how many findings were reversed, when the state stopped using the equipment, or how officials learned the tests were faulty.</p>
      <p>The Inspector General’s Office began investigating Microgenics’s drug-testing system two months ago, a spokesman, Lee Park, said.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the company that built and marketed the devices should be held accountable.</p>
      <p>“If you’re producing these machines and selling this product, you know about the serious consequences that flow from a mistake on your part,” said Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, a lawyer with Emery Celli Brinckerhoff &amp; Abady who is representing the plaintiffs. “You have an obligation to ensure they don’t happen.”</p>
      <p>Microgenics did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>The prison system has been using the Microgenics devices since 2018, when the state entered into a five-year, $1.6 million contract with the company to supply 52 prisons with its Indiko Plus “urinalysis analyzers,” according to the lawsuit and public records. In brochures, Microgenics says its products “provide true operational reliability.”</p>
      <p>Inmates began to complain almost immediately. Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, a nonprofit that assists prisoners, received letters from 158 inmates with the same grievance: They had tested positive for drugs when they had not used any, and received harsh punishments. Many of the letters came from people with no disciplinary history.</p>
      <p>Under state law, prisoners who are caught taking prohibited drugs can be sentenced to extra time, can be placed in isolation and can face other punishments after a hearing.</p>
      <p>One inmate said she was handcuffed while visiting with her family and sentenced to 60 days in solitary confinement after a positive drug test, the lawsuit said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a civil rights issue. It’s a justice issue,” said Karen Murtagh, executive director of the Prisoners’ Legal Services of New York, which is also representing the plaintiffs. Even though the corrections department is “doing what it can to make people whole, it is not completely undoing or remediating the harm caused by putting someone in solitary confinement for weeks or months.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Kearney, who had been convicted on a burglary charge, had violated his parole and was sent back to prison in 2016 because he missed a curfew and took drugs. But he maintains he did not use drugs while incarcerated.</p>
      <p>But after the test suggested that Mr. Kearney had used an opioid, he was held in prison beyond his release date of March 6. At his disciplinary hearing, prison officials dismissed his claims of innocence. He said he explained to them that he would have never used drugs knowing he was set to be released in a week. He also pointed out he had taken at least four other random tests in prison with negative findings.</p>
      <p>He was not freed until October, a month after prison officials learned that the results were inaccurate, he said. Mr. Kearney had served about a third of his 120 days of extra time in solitary confinement, he said.</p>
      <p>“If you’re going to arrest somebody and put them in the box and treat them like a locked-up dog, get the right results,” Mr. Kearney said, adding that he had lost a construction job that he had waiting for him in March.</p>
      <p>Nadezda Steele-Warrick said she was stunned in April when a sergeant and an officer arrested her in her private cell at the Albion Correctional Facility, about 45 minutes west of Rochester. It was her day off from teaching classes in the gym. She had been in bed reading “Small Great Things”<i> </i>by<i> </i>Jodi Picoult.</p>
      <p>At first, she said, she thought the corrections officers were playing a bad joke. But they were not. When they accused her of using drugs, she told them she had never taken illicit drugs before.</p>
      <p>Ms. Steele-Warrick, 36, had been a model prisoner since her conviction in 2015 on an assault charge, and prison officials had let her spend the weekend with her husband and 7-year-old son in April under a family reunification program. But she had to take drug tests before and after the visit. One of the tests came back positive.</p>
      <p>Her husband testified on her behalf at a disciplinary hearing that he had not seen her use drugs during his visit with her. But she was sentenced to confinement in general population for 11 days. She was only allowed to leave her cell for 10 minutes each to day to shower.</p>
      <p>“All I was doing was crying,” she said. “The turmoil I went through and the mental anguish — I wouldn’t want it to happen to anyone again.”</p>
      <p>Four months after Ms. Steele-Warrick was released from prison in May, the result of the hearing was overturned. The drug test was faulty, the lawsuit said.</p>
