      <p>The Baltimore Ravens might look very different today if they had gone through with signing Colin Kaepernick which likely would’ve led them to never drafting Lamar Jackson.</p>
      <p>During a recent episode of Ian Rapoport’s podcast “<a href="http://www.westwoodonepodcasts.com/pods/rapsheet-and-friends/">Rapsheet and Friends</a>,” — NFL Network’s Steve Wyche spoke about the Ravens’ prior interest in the former 49ers QB.</p>
      <blockquote>“Ian, let’s not forget, you reported on it. They were going to do that with Kaepernick. They were going to sign Kaepernick a couple years ago until one ill-fated tweet sabotaged that. Again, they were ready to pull the trigger on this before Lamar Jackson was even on the roster.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rapoport confirmed that Kaepernick to the Ravens was almost a done deal back in 2017.</p>
      <blockquote>“That’s true, and I think at that point Greg Roman was not offensive coordinator but on the staff,” Rapoport noted.</blockquote>
      <p>The team ultimately decided not to sign him after Kaepernick’s girlfriend posted a picture depicting Ray Lewis as a slave who will do anything for his master.</p>

      <p>That decision worked out great for the Ravens as we see Jackson is having an MVP-type of 2019 season.</p>
