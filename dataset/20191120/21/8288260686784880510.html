      <h1>'Rave reviews' - Snubbed West Brom winger tipped to make EFL return with West Midlands rivals</h1>
      <h2>West Bromwich Albion latest | The former Baggies academy star left the club in 2017 and has been linked with a Football League return.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:52:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/tom-leach/</a></address>
      <p>Former West Bromwich Albion youngster Chay Tilt could be set to make a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/football-league-championship">Football League</a> return with one of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> 's West Midlands rivals, according to Football Insider.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, who climbed the club's academy ranks, left <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/the-hawthorns">the Hawthorns</a> in 2017 before being snapped up by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/queens-park-rangers-fc">Queens Park Rangers</a> ' youth set-up.</p>
      <p>From there he became a regular for Rangers' under-23s before <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-brom-release-14-part-13146658">he was ultimately released</a> during the summer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But now Tilt - the brother of Blackpool defender Curtis - has been linked with a move to join League One side Coventry City, along with a number of other EFL sides.</p>
      <p>Mark Robins' scouts are said to have taken particular interest in watching the wide man this term during his side's soaring FA Cup run and have returned with rave reviews on the talent.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>So far this season he has scored five goals in 10 league games and can make the leap to join the Sky Blues right away after his current club, Stourbridge, could only pin him down to non-contract terms upon signing him at the start of the season.</p>
