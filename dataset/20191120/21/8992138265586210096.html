      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:55:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">Aziz Abdel-Qader</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin.com, the leading advocate for Bitcoin Cash, plans to launch a $200 million investment fund that will focus on BCH-based products such as payment solutions and non-custodial financial services.</p>
      <p>The new fund is set to complement the existing offering of <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-com-acquires-o3-labs-for-bch-specific-app-development/">Bitcoin Cash ecosystem</a>, which also include a gambling site, wallets and a news site.</p>

      <p>Although the exact details yet to be revealed, the initial description provided by <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/uk-judge-dismisses-craig-wrights-case-against-roger-ver/">Bitcoin.com chairman Roger Ver</a> suggests that it is not a hedge fund, but more a venture capital-style fund that will take a long-term view to the market.</p>

      <p>Roger, aka <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/pangea-blockchain-fund-raises-22-million-backed-by-roger-ver/">Bitcoin Jesus</a>, could not say if the fund has already planned to invest in any startup projects, but he did not discount investing in any particular infrastructure and businesses that are building on top the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Dubbed ‘BCH Ecosystem Investment Fund,’ its initial portfolio will include incubate businesses like payment gateways, processors remittances, wallet and merchant acquirers.</p>
      <p>In order to jumpstart the investors acquisition, startups looking for funding will be able to pitch their projects to the company. <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-com-eying-to-launch-bch-backed-futures-contract/">Roger and Bitcoin.com</a> will leverage their experience in investing to determine whether to grant funding, charging a fee for managing the fund, on top of the fees to access the underlying payment businesses.</p>
      <p>Projects will have to fit certain criteria to be considered for funding and a dedicated landing page for them to submit their business plans will be launched soon.</p>
      <h3>Institutional money is too lucrative to ignore</h3>
      <p>“We are super excited to launch the $200 million ecosystem fund that will rapidly scale up Bitcoin Cash focused businesses,” stated Bitcoin.com CEO Stefan Rust. He added that they already receive between 6 to 8 business plans every day from software entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>Rust referred to the Simple Ledger Protocol, a recently-introduced feature in Bitcoin Cash that allows for creating custom tokens that mimic Ethereum’s standard ERC-20 tokens.</p>
      <p>“Bitcoin.com is strongly promoting the adoption of Bitcoin Cash as peer-to-peer electronic money as well as the development of the surrounding BCH ecosystem. The protocol has helped the development of an ecosystem for BCH that replicates the variety of ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network,” he added.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin.com is a crypto news and information site that provides a variety related services, with an emphasis on Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/roger-ver-bitmain-sued-for-bch-hard-fork-manipulation/">Bitcoin Cash</a>, including a media outlet, crypto casino and a mobile wallet for both of these cryptocurrencies. It announced earlier this year it would <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/bitcoin-com-to-launch-a-crypto-exchange-next-month/">launch a crypto exchange called Exchange.Bitcoin.com</a>, the latest addition to a suite of products it provides beyond their news service.</p>
