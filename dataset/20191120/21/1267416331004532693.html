      <h1>Uber reports increase in requests for user data from Canadian authorities</h1>
      <h2>Canadian authorities filed 161 requests for data on users in 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:42:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Uber says the number of demands from Canadian authorities requesting riders’ data and information <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/uber-transparency-government-data/">significantly increased</a> last year.</p>
      <p>The ride-hailing company says the number of requests from law enforcement for user data in 2018 increased by 27 percent.</p>
      <p>Uber says that the spike in requests could be due to its business growing in size but could also be because of a rise in interest from authorities wanting to access data on riders.</p>
      <p>The company says that Canadian authorities filed 161 requests for data on 593 user accounts in 2018. The information consists of pickup and drop-off locations and other data that can identify users.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Uber says it provided ride information on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/uber-transparency-government-data/">1.8 million users to Canadian regulators</a>, which includes local taxi and transportation authorities. It says it is mandated to provide the information to regulators due to specific requirements that it is subject to.</p>
      <p>The ride-hailing service says that the rise in demands for user data is challenging for the company.</p>
      <p>Uber isn’t the only company that has had to turn over user data to authorities as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Twitter have all reported a rise in government requests.</p>
