      <h1>'Thank God': Putin pleased Republicans alleging Ukrainian interference in 2016 election</h1>

      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin took pleasure in the “political battles” of Washington, D.C., saying it has shifted focus away from Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“Thank God,” Putin <a href="https://apnews.com/ed2b2f90c74a420a8beb076c1c25df32">said</a> Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. “No one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they’re accusing Ukraine.”</p>
      <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-trumps-ukraine-crowdstrike-conspiracy-theory-front-and-center-in-impeachment-hearing">alleged that Ukraine</a> interfered in the 2016 election, and some Republicans have latched onto the belief during the impeachment proceedings.</p>
      <p>Special counsel Robert Mueller concluded in his investigation that Russian intelligence interfered in the election by hacking Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta’s email account and the Democratic National Committee’s email system, then giving the emails to WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Intelligence Community concluded in January 2017 that Putin "ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.”</p>
