      <h1>Ezekiel Elliott Reveals How Dak Prescott Reacted To His TD Celebration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T21:13:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 21:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>After catching a touchdown pass from Dak Prescott in Sunday’s win over the Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott broke out his best impression of the star quarterback’s “hip-whip” pregame routine.</p>
      <p>Apparently, Elliott did a pretty solid impersonation. Good enough to impress Prescott, in fact.</p>
      <p>Zeke told reporters today that Prescott told him he’s “nice” at the move. He also joked that he should switch positions.</p>

      <p>Dallas is more than fine with Elliott remaining at running back and Prescott playing QB. The Cowboys’ offense is clicking right now.</p>
      <p>They will face their toughest test yet this weekend though. Dallas travels to New England to face the Patriots and their stingy defense on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It will be a prime opportunity to make a big impression, considering the game will be played in front of a nationally-televised audience. Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. ET.</p>
