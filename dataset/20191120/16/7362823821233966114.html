      <h1>Gerardo Parra, known for 'Baby Shark' walk-up music, leaves Nationals to sign with Japan team</h1>

      <p>Gerardo Parra, who became a fan favorite with the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/washington-nationals">Washington Nationals</a> for his “Baby Shark” walk-up music, has signed a contract with the Yomiuri Giants of Japan’s Central League.</p>
      <p>The Nationals signed Parra in May after he was released from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/mlb/san-francisco-giants">San Francisco Giants</a>. He became a backup on the World Series-winning team. In 89 games with Washington, he batted .250 with a .747 OPS and eight home runs.</p>

      <p>Parra became a notable player nationally after he changed his walk-up song to “Baby Shark” after seeing his 2-year-old daughter dance to it. The song became an anthem and a rallying cry for the team that was 19-31 at one point during the season.</p>

      <p>Fans and teammates made shark-inspired hand gestures after each hit as other players worked out wearing headbands with the image of a cartoon shark. Some fans even came to games dressed in shark costumes.</p>

      <p>“I never do nothing intentional,” Parra told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/20/gerardo-parra-japan-yomiuri-giants-baby-shark-washington-nationals/">The Washington Post</a> during the Nationals’ playoff run. “Everything I do, I do from my heart because, if you don’t do it from your heart, nothing happen like it will happen right now.”</p>
