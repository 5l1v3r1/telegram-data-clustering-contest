      <p>Cain Velasquez may not be completely done with MMA, according to Tito Ortiz.</p>
      <p>Ortiz spoke with <a href="https://twitter.com/BloodyElbow"><i>Bloody Elbow</i></a> ahead of his fight with Alberto El Patron at Combate Americas on Dec. 7. ‘The Huntington Beach Bad Boy’says a fight was pitched between the winner of Ortiz vs. Alberto and former UFC heavyweight champion Cain Velasquez.</p>

      <p>“It’s not a one and done deal with Combate. I signed a three fight, two year contract with them. So there will be a fight after,” Ortiz said. “Campbell [McLaren] actually talked to Cain Velasquez and he said he’d like the winner of this. If Cain Velasquez can get to 205, I’m in. If he can make it to 210 I’m in.”</p>
      <p>Ortiz is coming off a vengeful first-round TKO of longtime rival Chuck Liddell. The fight took place at Golden Boy Promotions’ inaugural MMA event. Liddell entered the cage at 48-years-old opposite Ortiz’s 43. Many were disappointed with Liddell’s performance and argued ‘The Iceman’ had no business still competing. As far as Ortiz is concerned, the victory was sweet as candy.</p>
      <p>“It was everything I wanted it to be. Yeah, I wish it had happened earlier,” Ortiz said. “I went 3-1 in Bellator. I choked Chael Sonnen in the first two-and-a-half minutes. I felt great, I felt really good. With Chuck, with having that win over him—I told him not to do it. He said, ‘No, don’t tell me what to do. Just show up to the fight, ‘cause I’m going to knock you out.’ If I say no, it shows Dana [White] may have been right when he said I was scared to fight Chuck, which is all BS. At the end of the day I’m not afraid to fight any man.”</p>

      <p>Ortiz (20-12-1) fights Alberto (9-5) at Combate Americas on Dec. 7. The former WWE champion has not competed in professional MMA for more than nine years. Ortiz does not give his opponent much of a shot.</p>
      <p>“His chances in the fight are pretty much slim to none,” Ortiz exclaimed. “I’ll give him that puncher’s chance. He’s a big guy. I didn’t realize how big he was until we came face-to-face.”</p>
