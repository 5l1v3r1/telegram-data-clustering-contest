      <h1>Be Still Our Hearts! Adam Lamberg Is Returning as Gordo For the Lizzie McGuire Reboot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:07+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kelsie Gibson</a></address>
      <p>Our prayers have been answered, because Gordo is officially returning for the <b><a href="http://www.popsugar.com/Lizzie-McGuire">Lizzie McGuire</a></b> reboot! On Wednesday, Disney+ announced that actor <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lizzie-mcguire-reboot-details-46817325">Adam Lamberg would be reprising his role</a> as Lizzie's childhood best friend on the show. In the photo, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Hilary-Duff">Hilary Duff</a> and Lamberg are all smiles as they sit at a table for two. Perhaps their characters are getting reacquainted after all this time apart?</p>
      <p>While Gordo and Lizzie appeared to get together at the end of <b>The Lizzie McGuire Movie</b>, Duff recently confirmed that <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/09/interview-hilary-duff-younger-finale-lizzie-mcguire.html">she is engaged to someone else in the reboot</a>. "I feel like them not being together is what was so good [about the original series]," she told Vulture. "It's that one person that you're like, <i>Was he the one? Is it ever going to be?</i> You're always kind of wondering. We wanted it to hurt everyone a little bit, and it'll continue to hurt."</p>
      <p>Lamberg joins <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/lizzie-mcguire-reboot-cast-46805951">the growing list of original cast members returning for the new series</a>. In addition to Duff, the McGuire family — Jake Thomas, Hallie Todd, and Robert Carradine — will also be reprising their roles. There's also a good chance that we'll see Ethan Craft pop up in a few episodes. Duff recently teased that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/will-lizzie-mcguire-ethan-get-together-in-reboot-46875122">Lizzie and Ethan might have "a thing"</a> in the reboot. We can't wait to see how Gordo reacts to that. See the cute announcement video below!</p>
