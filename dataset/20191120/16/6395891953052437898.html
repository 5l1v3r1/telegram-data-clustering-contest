      <p><b>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP)</b> - The speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives says he wants Ohio State University to "do the right thing" for men who say they were sexually abused decades ago by a team doctor while school officials turned a blind eye.</p>
      <p>Republican Speaker Larry Householder told reporters he would prefer to see the university resolve the matter without action in the Legislature, where a related proposal is pending.</p>
      <p>About 300 men have brought federal lawsuits against Ohio State over its failure to stop now-deceased doctor Richard Strauss. Those lawsuits are in mediation toward a possible settlement.</p>
      <p>The university apologized but has argued the legal claims are time-barred by law. Some accusers are advocating legislation that would create a window for them to sue under state law.</p>
      <p>That proposal has stalled in a House committee.</p>
