      <p>Tehran (AFP) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday the country's people had defeated an "enemy conspiracy" behind a wave of violent protests and were celebrating their victory.</p>
      <p>Rouhani blamed the deadly unrest on "anarchists" who took to the streets "based on a plot that the region's reactionary, the Zionists and Americans hatched", referring respectively to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations erupted in sanctions-hit Iran on Friday, hours after the price of petrol was raised by as much as 200 percent.</p>
      <p>Motorists blocked highways in Tehran before the unrest spread to at least 40 urban centres, with petrol pumps torched, police stations attacked and shops looted.</p>
      <p>Officials have confirmed five deaths, including of three security personnel stabbed by "rioters".</p>
      <p>In Shahriar, west of Tehran, mourners chanted "Death to America" in a funeral procession on Wednesday for one of those killed, a Revolutionary Guards commander.</p>
      <p>The UN human rights office said it was alarmed by reports live ammunition had caused a "significant number of deaths".</p>
      <p>Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed, and that the real toll could be as high as 200.</p>
      <p>The full extent of the bloodshed was difficult to ascertain given a near-total internet blackout since the weekend.</p>
      <p>- 'Armed anarchists' -</p>
      <p>Rouhani told a cabinet meeting that "our people have been victorious against ... the enemy's conspiracy.</p>
      <p>"Those anarchists who came out onto the streets were few in number," he said, insisting "this is the biggest display of the power of the nation of Iran".</p>
      <p>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said late Tuesday that "the recent actions were security issues, not from the people... We have repelled the enemy."</p>
      <p>Khamenei has previously blamed the unrest on the Pahlavi royal family ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and armed opposition group the People's Mujahedeen of Iran, which Tehran considers a "terrorist" cult.</p>
      <p>In Shahriar, thousands of mourners trailed behind a truck carrying a coffin, clutching portraits of the slain Guard and posters that read "Down with USA".</p>
      <p>They passed burned-out buildings, including a bank, post office and shopping centre.</p>
      <p>One of the mourners, Younes Abutalebi, told AFP: "My pension is 18 million rials ($146). If it was cut... I would go begging -- but I wouldn't set fire to a bank."</p>
      <p>Rallies against the unrest were also held in Arak, Ardebil and Ghorghan, among other cities.</p>
      <p>- US warships -</p>
      <p>Iran's economy has been battered since May last year when President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions.</p>
      <p>Tensions have soared this year, with the US widening its sanctions to include Khamenei and other key entities as Iran cut its nuclear commitments.</p>
      <p>The arch-foes came to the brink of a military confrontation in June when Iran downed a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory strikes before cancelling them at the last minute.</p>
      <p>Iran was blamed for a September 14 attack that knocked out two major oil installations in Saudi Arabia, halving its crude output.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia's King Salman urged Iran on Wednesday to abandon an expansionist ideology that he said had "harmed" its own people.</p>
      <p>The French foreign ministry expressed "deep concern over information indicating the deaths of numerous protesters" in Iran.</p>
      <p>It urged "respect of freedom of expression and access to means of communication, as well as the right to demonstrate peacefully".</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the US aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln sailed through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway separating Iran and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>Iran regularly threatens to shut the strait if its enemies commit hostile acts.</p>
      <p>Last week's surprise fuel price hike was agreed by the president, parliament speaker and judiciary chief.</p>
      <p>Rouhani has defended the move, pledging proceeds would go to the needy.</p>
      <p>In his latest remarks, he said the first payments had been made to more than seven million people, and that in total 18 million would receive handouts by Saturday.</p>
