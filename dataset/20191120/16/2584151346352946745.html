      <h2>The conservative government wants to send a ‘clear message’ to people considering entering Greece illegally.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:05:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:05</time> by <a rel="author">Nektaria Stamouli</a></address>
      <p>ATHENS — Greece will shut down overcrowded camps for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands and replace them with closed pre-removal detention centers, it announced on Wednesday as part of the new conservative government's drive to toughen up the response to illegal immigration.</p>
      <p>According to the plans presented on Wednesday by government spokesman Stelios Petsas and Deputy Defense Minister Alkiviadis Stefanis, the new centers will host between 1,000 and 5,000 people and will replace existing facilities, including the notorious <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/11/greeces-moria-refugee-camp-a-european-failure/601132/">Moria camp</a> on Lesbos.</p>
      <p>New accommodation centers will be created on the mainland, where people on the islands will be transferred. Asylum seekers relocated to the new centers won't be detained, but they will only be allowed out of the camp on a specific schedule.</p>
      <p>“A clear message should be sent to those planning to come, or thinking of coming, to the country illegally when they are not entitled to asylum,” Petsas said. “Ιf they give money to a trafficker to bring them to Greece they will eventually lose it.”</p>
      <p>Stefanis said the aim was to avoid having "a new Moria."</p>
      <aside>Asylum seekers relocated to the new centers won't be detained, but they will only be allowed out of the camp on a specific schedule.</aside>
      <p>The conservative government vowed to move some 20,000 asylum seekers to the mainland by the beginning of 2020, in response to a situation where thousands of people are living in small tents, or sleeping rough, in appalling conditions in open fields on Lesbos and four other islands in the eastern Aegean. Some 37,000 asylum seekers are currently on the islands, in accommodation originally designed for around 7,000. The fear is that living conditions could quickly deteriorate further as winter approaches.</p>
      <p>Since New Democracy took over the government in July, migration has emerged as its biggest headache, with flows of migrants and refugees rising to the highest level since the EU-Turkey agreement of 2016, which had been designed to stem arrivals to the EU.</p>
      <p>More than 62,000 people have reached Greece's land and sea borders so far this year, compared to around 38,000 combined in Spain and Italy, the other two frontline countries.</p>
      <p>The ruling party has taken a tougher stance on migration, already adopted <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/greece-toughen-asylum-rules-as-migrant-arrivals-rise/">stricter asylum</a> laws that aim to make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers — a development criticized by aid organizations.</p>

      <p>“The plan announced, which follows the already voted asylum legislation, reaffirms our concerns about this policy," said Gabriel Sakellaridis, Amnesty International's executive director in Greece.</p>
      <p>"Asylum seekers can be detained in Greece for extended period and with limited means of appeal (the asylum rejection), in clear violation of international standards, under which detention should not be the rule,” Sakellaridis told POLITICO.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if the government's plans can be effectively implemented, as the EU-Turkey deal envisaged closed centers, but it soon became clear that this couldn't be put into practise.</p>
      <p>For the moment, the governor of the Northern Aegean region, Konstantinos Moutzouris, has agreed to the closed detention centers if they are located away from towns on the islands, and providing this means the current camps are closed completely.</p>
      <p>The government has also had to deal with reactions from local communities on the mainland, who have in recent weeks protested and blocked the transfer of asylum seekers to their areas. In other cases, asylum seekers decided to leave the new locations because they were too remote or the living conditions were poor.</p>
      <p>Some officials say the government may not be able to uphold its commitment to ensure that the intake of each center does not exceed 1 percent of the population of local communities in the area hosting them.</p>
      <aside>Since New Democracy took over the government in July, migration has emerged as its biggest headache.</aside>
      <p>To appease locals, the government announced compensatory measures that include hiring some 1,700 people to work as border guards, asylum service employees and officers at the centers, with priority given to applicants from local communities.</p>
      <p>Petsas also announced that a reduced value-added tax regime for the five islands of the northeastern Aegean most affected by the refugee crisis will apply until the end of 2020, while Stefanis said new criteria would be introduced to govern which NGOs helping migrants are allowed to operate in Greek territory.</p>
