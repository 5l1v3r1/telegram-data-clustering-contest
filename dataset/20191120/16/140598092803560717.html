      <h1>One of Malta's richest men arrested as 'person of interest' in investigation into murder of crusading journalist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:52:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-squires/" target="_blank">Nick Squires</a></address>
      <p>The investigation into the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia took a dramatic turn on Wednesday when armed forces arrested one of the country’s richest men on his luxury yacht.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech, a wealthy businessman and casino owner, was detained before dawn when members of the Maltese armed forces intercepted his yacht at sea.</p>
      <p>The boat was escorted back to port by an armed forces patrol boat.</p>
      <p>Shortly before the seizure, a warrant for Mr Fenech’s arrest was signed by a magistrate, Malta’s press reported.</p>
      <p>There were reports that Mr Fenech had been trying to reach Italy by sea.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, just hours earlier, he resigned as head of his business empire and transferred ownership to his brother, Franco Fenech.</p>

      <p>The transfer of control was reported by The Times of Malta, based on documents uploaded to the Malta Business Registry.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech was described by Joseph Muscat, the prime minister, as a “person of interest” in the long-running investigation into the murder of Caruana Galizia, who was blown up by a car bomb as she left her home in October 2017.</p>
      <p>The arrest of Fenech came just a day after it emerged that the Maltese authorities have in their custody an <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/19/malta-arrests-man-suspected-middleman-murder-journalist-daphne/">alleged middleman in the murder plot</a>, who has asked for a pardon in return for divulging who was behind the killing.</p>
      <p>Dr Muscat said that in the wake of the whistle-blower’s arrest, he had ordered additional police surveillance on other suspects.</p>

      <p>"Had I not done that, today we might be talking of a person or persons of interest having potentially escaped," the prime minister said.</p>
      <p>Under Maltese law, police have 48 hours to question Mr Fenech, after which they must charge or release him.</p>
      <p>In the months before her death, Caruana Galizia wrote about a mysterious company, based in Dubai, called 17 Black Ltd.</p>
      <p>She alleged it was connected to politicians in Malta, although she provided no evidence.</p>
      <p>But an investigation last year by Reuters revealed that the owner of the company was Yorgen Fenech.</p>
      <p>According to a document uncovered by Malta’s financial regulators in 2015, 17 Black Ltd was due to make payments of up to $2 million to Panama-based companies owned by two men close to the prime minister – Konrad Mizzi, the then energy minister, and Keith Schembri, Dr Muscat’s chief of staff. There is no evidence the payments were made.</p>
      <p>The prime minister insisted there was no indication that either Mr Mizzi or Mr Schembri were involved in the car bombing.</p>
      <p>But on Twitter, the three sons of Caruana Galizia directly tied the two politicians to Fenech, the arrested businessman. “We got here in spite of Joseph Muscat. And there are politicians – in his cabinet – linked to the case,” wrote Paul Caruana Galizia.</p>
      <p>Another son, Andrew, wrote: “A power station owner suspected of kick-back payments to the prime minister’s chief of staff and energy minister has just been arrested in connection with my mother’s assassination. It’s time for Mizzi and Schembri to resign and be placed under surveillance.”</p>
      <p>The murder of the crusading blogger and journalist revealed a murky web of sleaze, cronyism and corruption on the island, from online gambling infiltrated by organised crime to fuel smuggling in Maltese waters and the sale of Maltese passports to foreigners.</p>
      <p>In a new book about the murder case, Murder on the Malta Express, the authors wrote: “Daphne was still working on what 17 Black meant when she was killed eight months later.”</p>
      <p>After being given a stack of leaked documents, the journalist had stumbled on “an entirely new and massive corruption scandal,” said authors Manuel Delia, a Maltese journalist, and John Sweeney, a former BBC Panorama and Newsnight journalist. “She understood the scandal was there, waiting to be unearthed.”</p>
      <p>Three men are due to go on trial charged with planting and detonating the bomb that killed the 53-year-old journalist, who exposed sleaze and corruption in Malta through her avidly-read blog, Running Commentary. They have pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>But exactly who ordered the murder, and for what reason, has remained a mystery.</p>
      <p>Mr Fenech is the director and part owner of a company that six years ago won a lucrative energy concession from the Maltese government to build a new liquid natural gas power station to meet the island’s energy needs.</p>
