      <h1>Len Goodman says 'raunchy' Strictly needs to go 'back to its roots'</h1>
      <h2>The former head judge hits out…</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:27:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Brown</a></address>
      <p>He was head judge on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> for 12 years and now Len Goodman has hit out at the show's "raunchy" routines.</p>
      <p>Len – who left the show in 2016 – wants Strictly to go "back to its roots" and concentrate more on ballroom dancing and less on props, sexy routines and theatrics.</p>
      <p>The veteran dancer is stepping down from America's Dancing With The Stars, which he has worked on for 14 years, when it ends next week.</p>

      <p>And he has some very clear ideas of what he doesn't want to see on the ballroom floor.</p>

      <p>Len revealed: "It’s not only sex, I used to hate it even if a swing was involved and they were sitting on a swing. And props, going down on one knee, giving them a rose. Get on with it!"</p>
      <p>He added that, when he left Strictly, he "didn't exactly miss it" and explained that he didn't like the show how it was.</p>

      <p>Len said: "It’s like a plant. If you want it to thrive you have to prune it a bit and change it slightly to let it thrive. But you don’t pull a plant up and chop off the roots. A little tweaking I don’t mind, but I liked Strictly as it was."</p>

      <p>While his co-judges Craig Revel Horwood and Bruno Tonioli adapted well to the changes brought in by producers, Len said that he didn't because he isn't from a theatrical background.</p>

      <p>"I’m not from that world. I’m from the ballroom world. We all judge with the eyes of our experiences. I got beaten down in the end," Len said.</p>
      <p>He also revealed that he was "anti" the judges dancing at the start of each show.</p>
      <p>The remaining six stars are set to take to the Strictly dance floor this weekend, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/strictly-come-dancing/strictly-come-dancing-michelle-visage-voted-out-in-week-9/">after Michelle Visage got the boot</a> last weekend.</p>
