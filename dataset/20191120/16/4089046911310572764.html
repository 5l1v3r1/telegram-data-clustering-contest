      <p><b>(CNN) –</b> “Game of Thrones” was well-known for its graphic violence and sex scenes.</p>
      <p>Emilia Clarke, who rose to fame as Daenerys Targaryen in the series, said the show’s legacy is coloring expectations of her in new roles.</p>
      <p>Especially in the early seasons, the English actress showed a lot of skin in the role. Clarke later made headlines as she pushed back on scripts that called for nudity.</p>
      <p>She credits GOT co-star Jason Momoa for encouraging her to stand up for what she’s comfortable with.</p>
      <p>Clarke said producers of projects she’s worked on since GOT have also tried to pressure her to appear without her clothes.</p>
      <p>Clarke recently told Dax Shepherd on his "Armchair Expert" podcast that she's taking an even tougher stance during her post-GOT career.</p>
      <p>She said she’s upfront with producers now and refuses to do anything she finds gratuitous.</p>
