      </p>
      <p>The Ondo State Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps has disclosed no fewer than 156 people had died as a result of the road accidents which occurred in the state between January and October 2019.</p>
      <p>The crashes were said to have occurred at some places described as black spots across the 18 local government areas of the state.</p>
      <p>The Sector Commander of the FRSC in the state, Mr Rotimi Adeleye who stated this while speaking with journalists in Akure, the state capital, said the casualty figure was recorded in the 251 road accidents that had happened in the state within the period under review.</p>
      <p>According to the FRSC boss, the notable black spots within the state are, Ore junction, Ajebandele, Oke Alamojuto in Ikare, Oka Akoko Epinmi Akoko, Owo junction, Onyearugbulem junction along Akure-Owo Expressway, and Akure- Ondo road.</p>
      <p>Giving the breakdown, Adeleye said, a total of 104 crashes and 65 deaths were recorded in the first quarter. Sixty-eight crashes and 47 deaths in the second quarter while 79 accidents and 44 deaths were recorded in the third quarter of this year.”</p>
      <p>On measures taken to prevent accident cases during the Yuletide season, the sector commander revealed that the corps planned to establish two camps where officers and men will be posted to work during the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>” These two camps will take care of road crashes and gridlocks within each of their jurisdictions that had been strategically mapped out,” Adeleye explained.</p>
      <p>He appealed to the members of the public to always report reckless and drunken drivers to the law enforcement agents, particularly the FRSC. He also urged motorists to drive carefully and always obey the rules and regulations of the traffic.</p>
