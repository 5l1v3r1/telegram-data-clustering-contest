      <h2>The treatment promises to prevent frost from sticking to your windows, meaning you'll spend less time in the cold</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:49:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:49</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, Rachel Pugh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>Standing outside attempting to breathe life back into our hands as they thaw over during an attempt to de-ice our car windows is all too familiar.</p>
      <p>The cheap spray-on de-icers never seem to do the job and we've usually forgotten to buy a scraper before the cold <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> sets in, leaving us to battle the ice armed only with a flimsy bank card.</p>
      <p>If you're fed up of having to wake up earlier to clear your car, a new solution promises to banish windscreen ice for good.</p>
      <p>Halfords autocentres are offering to treat cars with Duxback, which lasts for up to six months and will stop frost sticking to your windows in winter, as reported by <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/motoring/halfords-ice-fog-windscreen-spray-17239767">Manchester Evening News</a> .</p>

      <p>The product was initially developed for Boeing cockpit glass and creates a 'hydrophobic' effect, which also helps to 'dramatically improve visibility in the rain'.</p>
      <p>The website claims water will run straight off, so if you are travelling faster than 40mph ' you won't even need wipers'.</p>
      <p>The treatment costs £25 and options include windscreen and front side windows, and full car.</p>
      <p>The Halfords website states: "Duxback is a professional-quality car glass treatment that makes driving safer.</p>

      <p>"Originally developed for the airline industry, Duxback causes water to 'bead' on glass, dramatically improving visibility in the rain.</p>
      <p>"What's more, it makes cleaning much easier, and prevents frost sticking to your windscreen in winter."</p>
      <p>You can book your car in for the treatment <a href="https://www.halfordsautocentres.com/car-care/duxback-windscreen">here</a> .</p>
      <p>While you wait to get that sorted, one man's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/mans-genius-de-icing-hack-13909399">genius solution to beat the ice</a> has gone down a storm online - and it keeps your hands warm, too.</p>
      <p>Instead of using a can of de-icer and a scraper, Daniel Harris fills a sandwich bag with warm water.</p>
      <p>He then simply drags it over the windows and watches the ice melt immediately, leaving others to wonder why they haven't been using the method for years.</p>
