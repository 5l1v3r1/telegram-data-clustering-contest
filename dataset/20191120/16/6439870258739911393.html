      <p>FLORENCE, S.C. (WMBF) – The Florence Humane Society said it received an overwhelming response after it asked for foster families to take in several puppies.</p>
      <p>A pregnant dog was brought to the shelter by Florence animal control crews after she was found chained and starving. The humane society reported that the dog successfully gave birth to 12 puppies Monday night.</p>
      <p>“Due to her emaciated condition, she does not have enough milk. We need volunteers willing to foster 2-3 puppies,” the humane society said in a Facebook post.</p>
      <p>Jayne Boswell said they were able to find enough foster families to take the puppies and help bottle feed them while their mother recovers.</p>
