      <p>An upgraded Hammersmith Bridge will not be sturdy enough for London’s current fleet of electric double decker buses in what’s been described as a “strange oversight”.</p>
      <p>The bridge has been closed indefinitely to vehicles since 10 April, with the Hammersmith and Fulham council seeking government funding for restorations.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It was revealed in TfL documents today that the current plans for the upgrade would only allow for a “limited number of electric buses”.</p>
      <p>A TfL spokesperson confirmed that current electric double decker buses would be too heavy to cross the bridge.</p>
      <p>Campaign for Better Transport chief executive Darren Shirley said this seemed like a “strange oversight”.</p>
      <p>“Electric buses will play an increasingly central role in cleaning up London’s toxic air, so it seems a strange oversight not to ensure electric buses would be able to travel on an upgraded road,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Providing clean, green, affordable and reliable public transport is the best way to get more people out of cars and help reduce congestion and carbon emissions from transport.”</p>
      <p>In September, mayor of London Sadiq Khan announced London now boasted Europe’s largest electric bus fleet.</p>
      <p>The capital has more than 200 electric buses and has awarded contracts for a further 78 electric double deckers.</p>
      <p>A TfL spokesperson said changes in technology may allow new electric double deckers to travel on the Hammersmith Bridge.</p>
      <p>“We’re always investigating other tech, and there is the potential for ‘opportunity charging’.</p>
      <p>“This is basically charging points along the bus route, where the bus can get a boost.</p>
      <p>“That means that the battery doesn’t need to be as big, and therefore the bus isn’t as heavy.”</p>
      <p>The council closed Hammersmith Bridge in April due to “critical faults” that sparked safety concerns.</p>

      <p>The council has said repairs could cost in the region of £120m and take three years to complete.</p>
      <p>Transport for London (TfL) has so far committed £25m to the project to help with planning and design.</p>
