      <p>November is a busy time for world-class <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing">sport</a> in the UAE. But while there’s the T10 in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/407064-watch-the-f1-in-abu-dhabi">Abu Dhabi before the F1</a> kicks off next week (November 28-December 1), top sporting action is happening here in Dubai, too.<br/><br/>The 11th edition of the DP World Tour Championship takes place this weekend (Thursday November 21 to Sunday November 24) at <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing/sport/398714-the-best-five-golf-courses-in-dubai">Jumeirah Golf Estates</a>, and golf fans will be eagerly awaiting the competition. It was won last year by British golfer Danny Willett, but who will claim the spoils this year?<br/><br/>“It’s always nice to come back and defend a title anywhere in the world,” said Willett. “And for it to be the final event of the year in Dubai with the new format of 50 guys competing in a really strong field again - it’s good fun.<br/><br/>“We'll see how the week pans out, how the weather is looking. I'm sure we'll get four exciting days of golf for everyone that comes to the event. Hopefully on Sunday we're in a similar position.”<br/><br/>The championship is also the season-ender for the European Tour’s Race to Dubai, the top 50 golfers of which will battle it out for US$8m (Dhs29.3m).<br/><br/>The Race to Dubai covers 47 tournaments across 31 countries. And standing in the lead of the race following last weekend’s Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa is Bernd Wiesberger. In second is Tommy Fleetwood, third is Jon Rahm, fourth Shane Lowry and fifth is Matthew Fitzpatrick.<br/><br/>Twenty-eight-year-old British golfer Tommy Fleetwood, who won the Race to Dubai in 2017, is back to try and regain the title this year.<br/><br/>“I consider myself lucky that I’ve got a lot of experience of being in this position,” said Fleetwood, who is just 723 points behind Wiesberger in the rankings ahead of the challenge.<br/><br/>“This is my third year in a row where I'm one of those players that has a chance to win the Race to Dubai. It's very special. There are only a certain number of people that have the Race to Dubai on their resumé. I'm lucky to be one of them and I think it's one of my greatest achievements.”<br/><br/>With a huge winner’s cheque of US$3 million, which is the largest first prize in world golf, along with an additional US$2 million for the winner of the Race to Dubai, the financial stakes are also high this week.<br/><br/>“You have to play extremely well against all these players to find yourself in contention,” added Fleetwood. “If you don't, you're not going to be there, and that's it, really. You can only try your best. It's been a long year.”<br/><br/>If you’re looking to go along to Jumeirah Golf Estates, entry is free, but you’ll need to register before.<br/><br/>“It’s a privilege to host this exciting tournament,” said Yousuf Kazim, Jumeirah Golf Estates’ Chief Executive Officer.<br/><br/>“This is the eleventh year and we’re looking forward to another great week. We believe we have created an unrivalled sport and lifestyle community for our residents and hosting the DP World Tour Championship gives us a wonderful opportunity to showcase our development to the thousands of spectators who visit the event and the millions more watching around the world. This tournament is great for Dubai in general as it really puts the emirate’s footprint on the world map.”<br/><br/>Fancy seeing some of the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing/sport/398714-the-best-five-golf-courses-in-dubai">best golfers</a> in the world?
