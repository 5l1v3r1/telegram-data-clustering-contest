      <h1>'Probably not': Trump adviser says president is unlikely to testify in impeachment process</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:33:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>President Trump’s impeachment adviser Pam Bondi claimed it was unlikely that the president will testify in the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-intelligence-committee-holds-impeachment-hearing-featuring-gordon-sondland">impeachment proceedings against him</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump said Monday that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-like-the-idea-trump-will-strongly-consider-giving-impeachment-testimony-to-get-congress-moving">he was “strongly considering”</a> providing written impeachment testimony if it would speed up the process and get Congress back to work. He tweeted, “Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea [of testifying and] will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!”</p>
      <p>Bondi tapped the breaks on Trump’s statement, telling <i>CBS This Morning</i> on Wednesday that he “probably” won’t testify.</p>
      <p>“Of course, he wants to testify because he did nothing wrong. But do I think it’s likely he’s going to testify? Probably not because no one would advise him to testify because this is a sham court,” Bondi explained. “It really is.”</p>

      <p>Bondi claimed House Democrats want Trump to prove his innocence and that the hearing would not be “equal and fair” for the president. She added, “No, the president should not testify. I know exactly why he wants to, though. But no human being should have to come in and prove their innocence ever.”</p>
      <p>She denied that the White House was concerned that Trump would lie under oath and put his presidency at risk if he testified.</p>
      <p>“The president has done nothing wrong, and the president would love to come in and take an oath and tell the truth,” Bondi explained, later adding, “It’s a sham what they’ve been trying to do. Yet the president has continued running our country every day.”</p>
      <p>Bondi, 54, was recently added to Trump’s impeachment team. She was previously the attorney general of Florida. Bondi’s ties to Trump, including several campaign donations, caused problems in her attorney general’s office after <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-said-he-would-love-her-in-his-administration-pam-bondi-cashed-out-for-k-street-instead">she refused to join</a> a lawsuit with several other states against the president related to Trump University.</p>
      <p>Bondi was one of several Trump supporters to be accosted in public following his election. She was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-false-patriotism-of-the-partisan-puritans">harassed in a movie theater</a> while leaving a film about Mr. Rodgers.</p>
