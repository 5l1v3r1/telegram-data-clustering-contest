      </p>
      <p>Whilst Macy's character Ruby is well behaved, parents Fiz and Tyrone have been struggling <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/corrie-viewers-split-over-how-to-handle-fiz-and-tyrones-psycho-daughter/">with Hope's behaviour</a>.</p>
      <p>Last year <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/corrie-fans-choked-as-fiz-leaves-weatherfield-but-is-it-for-good/">Fiz and Hope went to Birmingham</a> so Hope could attend a school which specialises in children with bad behaviour, however it seems Hope hasn't changed as much as they wanted.</p>
      <p>Since returning,<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoiler-hope-sets-fire-to-the-street/"> she started a fire at the factory</a> and in spoilers for next week's episodes, it looks like <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-hope-starts-another-fire/">another fire starts at the fireworks party,</a> but is Hope to blame?</p>
