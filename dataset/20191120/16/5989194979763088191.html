      </p>

      <p>The open-air museum Vallby near Västerås is another place that should be particularly interesting for children, as an old farm is opened and you're welcome to pet the animals.

      <p>The Gammelstad Church Town is Sweden's largest and best-preserved church town, and a Unesco World Heritage site with more than 400 quaint little red cottages. Located in the far north of Sweden, it may very well be one of the country's most atmospheric Christmas markets, and if you go there, be sure to wear layers and layers, because it is one of the markets where you are as good as guaranteed to get plenty of snow.</p>
      <p>For the first time, the market will also have a reindeer (named Hilda) among its visitors.</p>
      <p><b>When: </b>December 7th-8th</p>

      <p>This is not strictly speaking a Christmas market, but a staple of the Swedish Christmas calendar in any case. The yule goat, a 13-metre-tall straw beast, in Gävle has unfortunately become known around the globe for <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20151126/five-weirdest-attacks-on-swedens-straw-yule-goat">getting burned down by arsonists more often than not</a>. On December 1st Gävle residents will gather to welcome this year's goat to their city, in the hope that it will get to make it through the season in one piece.</p>
      <p><b>When: </b>December 1st, 3-4pm</p>
