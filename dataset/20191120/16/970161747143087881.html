        <b>Parma’s teenager midfielder Dejan Kulusevski is attracting attention from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> giants, but insists he is not thinking about the transfer speculation surrounding him at the moment.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old is incredibly inexperienced having made just 16 professional appearances, but he has caught the eye while on loan at Parma from Atalanta this season.</p>
      <p>The Swede was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/dejan-kulusevski-catches-attention-manchester-united-scout-ahead-january-transfer-window-11084976/">reportedly spotted by a </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/dejan-kulusevski-catches-attention-manchester-united-scout-ahead-january-transfer-window-11084976/"> scout</a> when they were over in Italy keeping up on the progress of Chris Smalling as Roma took on Parma.</p>
      <p>In his 12 Serie A appearances this season, the teenager has already chipped in with five assists and two goals, making him something of a creative force from midfield.</p>

      <p>While it was the Red Devils that had a scout in attendance for Parma’s 2-0 win over Roma, Arsenal are also thought to hold an interest in the young Swede, as are Wolves and Southampton.</p>

      <p>Despite this, Kulusevski insists he is solely concentrating on playing well for his current club and has seemingly ruled out a January move.</p>
      <p>‘I’m fine at Parma, I’m happy to be here, I’ve found the perfect club,’ said the teenager.</p>
      <p>‘The market? I’m playing well, so it’s normal to write about other clubs, but I don’t think about (a January move) because I have an annual deal with Parma.’</p>
      <p>Kulusevski made his Sweden debut over the latest international break, coming off the bench in a 3-0 victory over the Faroe Islands.</p>
      <p>He has been promoted from the Under-21 side, having played and scored in wins over Iceland and Luxembourg last month.</p>
      <p>The Premier League sides interested in his signature will continue to monitor his progress when Parma return to Serie A action away to Bologna on Sunday.</p>
