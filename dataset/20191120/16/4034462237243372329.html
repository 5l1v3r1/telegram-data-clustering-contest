      <h1>Ultra-Luxury Maybach GLS SUV Shows Its Face</h1>
      <h2>All will be revealed tomorrow when Maybachâ€™s first-ever SUV makes its world debut.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:40:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>While the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/what-to-look-out-for-at-the-2019-la-auto-show">2019 LA Auto Show</a> is currently underway, Mercedes has chosen to unveil the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/here-s-what-maybach-s-ultra-luxury-suv-will-look-like">Maybach GLS</a> at the Auto Guangzhou in China this week. Ahead of its debut on November 21, Mercedes has released a new teaser photo of the swanky SUV, which the automaker describes as "the new face of ultimate luxury."</p>
      <p>We get a clear look at the Maybach GLS's gigantic grille with vertical slats, confirming that the design cues will be inspired by the peculiar Vision Maybach Ultimate Luxury Concept that debuted in Beijing last year, which combined design elements from SUVs and sedans. We're expecting the production model to be toned down, though.</p>

      <p>The headlights also appear to have different graphics to distinguish the posh SUV from the regular <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/gls">Mercedes GLS</a>. Like Mercedes-Maybach sedans, the crossover is also likely to be offered with two-tone color options to make the exterior look more lavish.</p>
      <p>The opulent SUV is also expected to boast an even longer wheelbase than the current GLS, which has a 123.4-inch base, to provide more space for rear passengers. While the exterior won't look dramatically different from the regular Mercedes GLS, the interior will be significantly more luxurious, particularly for rear passengers.</p>

      <p>Mercedes hasn't released any teaser photos of the interior, but the Vision Maybach Ultimate Luxury Concept featured two 12.3-inch screens displaying the instruments and infotainment, a wide center console, and even came with a heated tray with teapot and cups.</p>
      <p>Powertrain details haven't been confirmed yet, but we're expecting the Maybach GLS to be powered by a twin-turbo V8 that sends over 500 hp to all four wheels. Alternatively, it could adopt a V12 powerplant, which is normally reserved for high-end Maybach models. We'll find out more tomorrow when Maybach's first-ever SUV makes its world debut.</p>
