      <h3>UKIE Calls on Next UK Government to Better Support the UK Games Industry</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 20 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) has published a <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/ukiemanifesto2019">manifesto</a> for the general election. The manifesto details how the next Government can support the video game industry in the UK. The trade association has listed ten proposals in which the Government can help turn the "UK into the best place to make, sell and play games in the world."</p>

      <p>UKIE wants the UK to be a world leader when it comes to the video game industry. Currently, the UK games industry supports 50,000 jobs and contributes around £2.87 billion GVA into the economy each year. The manifesto puts recommendations to the Government to ensure that the UK's position in the games industry stays at the forefront as the industry as a whole grows.</p>
      <p>The manifesto calls on the next Government to do a variety of things to help accomplish this. UKIE wants the next Government to invest public funding into games that are "cultural" to the UK, eSports and the industry as a whole from places like the Arts Council and National Lottery. UKIE also suggests funding new or existing local games festivals, including festivals outside of London. UKIE also wants support from the Government in making the industry more diverse, and for the Government to extend the UK Games Fund "for prototyping video games and establish additional funding for mid-stage projects."</p>
      <p>However, not everyone agrees with UKIE's proposal for using public funding for "cultural games," especially when some big developers are claiming Video Game Tax Relief (VGTR) for their "culturally British" games.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.taxwatchuk.org/reports/gaming-the-tax-system/">investigation</a> published by <a href="https://www.taxwatchuk.org/">Tax Watch UK</a> earlier this year suggests that <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n38522/grand-theft-auto-v-rockstar-tax">Rockstar Games has not paid UK corporation tax in the past ten years</a>, claiming back £42 million in taxpayer money using the Government's Video Game Tax Relief fund, despite making an estimated operating profit of $5 billion between 2013-2019. Rockstar Games also had a pool of $3.4 billion for bonus payouts to top members of staff between 2009 and 2019.</p>

      <p>George Turner, director of <a href="https://www.taxwatchuk.org/">Tax Watch UK</a>, told True Achievements, "The Government is already spending three times more than they planned on video games tax relief (VGTR). Unless there is serious reform of the system, any more money is likely to be hoovered up by big business with crumbs left for everyone else.</p>
      <p>"If the UKIE wanted to make a useful and serious contribution to the debate, they could look at how VGTR could be better targetted to supporting games developers that really need help, rather than lobbying for more taxpayers cash to be sent to large, already wealthy, tax-dodging corporations."</p>
      <p>Video Game Tax Relief is a Government scheme that allows video game developers to apply for tax relief funding from the HMRC. The game being developed has to pass a "cultural test" conducted by the British Film Institute (BFI). If a game is considered "culturally Britsh" then it can benefit from VGTR. To qualify as "culturally British," a game has to score a minimum of 16 out of 31 points on the BFI cultural test. There is also a Golden Points rule in place, which is supposed to ensure that a game has some cultural value, and doesn't qualify for VGTR just by being made in the UK.</p>
      <p>According to another <a href="https://www.taxwatchuk.org/cultural_test_tax_relief/">Tax Watch UK report</a> (that looks into how games qualify for tax relief) even with the Golden Points rule games can still pass the test "so long as it's "in the English language, developed in the European Economic Area by EEA citizens or residents and has a game script or narrative written by a British citizen, regardless of the underlying subject matter which the game is based on."</p>
      <p>UKIE's proposal is a step in the right direction, especially when it comes to increasing diversity and calling for the Government to invest in localised gaming festivals outside of London. However, when it comes to taxpayer's money, there needs to be some caution involved. It certainly sounds like reforms need to be put in place to stop billion-dollar giants from claiming back vasts sums of tax when smaller developers could potentially be missing out on much-needed funding<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/tags/Industry-News">Industry News<br/></a><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39753/ukie-manifesto-games-industry#oMessages">View comments <br/></a><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0003474100/3474165.jpg" width="64" height="64"/><br/>Written by <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey<br/></a>Hey everyone!
