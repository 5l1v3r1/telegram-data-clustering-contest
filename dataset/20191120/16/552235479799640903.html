      <h1>Long-serving Rutherglen minister Alistair May could be set to depart the parish</h1>
      <h2>Alistair May will preach as sole nominee at Dalziel St Andrew’s Parish Church in Motherwell next month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:43:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Geddes, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jonathan-geddes/</a></address>
      <p>The longest-serving Church of Scotland minister in Rutherglen could be set to depart his post in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Alistair May, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Stonelaw Parish Church</a> , will preach as sole nominee at Dalziel St Andrew’s Parish Church in Motherwell next month.</p>
      <p>If the congregation votes in favour of having him as minister, Reverend May will call time on an 18-year spell at Stonelaw early in 2020.</p>
      <p>He told the Reformer: “It has been an emotional decision but the time feels right. </p>
      <p>“We’ve been very comfortable at Stonelaw and it has been a fantastic 18 years here, for me and my family.</p>
      <p>“But 18 years is a long ministry in the Church of Scotland, and there is always a time for refreshment, for both the church and for myself.</p>
      <p>“Stonelaw is in a good place at the moment, after we had the refurbishment of the new sanctuary this year, and it feels like a good time for someone else to come in and usher in a new chapter for us and the congregation.”</p>
      <p>Alistair grew up in Rutherglen and has been a popular figure in the area since taking over at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/minister-rutherglen-church-calls-rehabilitation-14060680">Stonelaw</a> in 2001.</p>
      <p>He added: “Leaving will be heartbreaking if it happens. I’ll be working full tilt until Christmas and then we’ll see what happens in the New Year. <br/>“We’ll miss a great amount about the parish if we move because it is a fantastic church with fantastic people.</p>
      <p>“Of course if I move we’ll be staying in touch with many people and I’ll still have family in the area.”</p>
      <p>The recent refurbishment has seen the old pews removed, new chairs brought in and improved heating.</p>
      <p>Alistair enthused: “The last year has been really exciting here, and there has been a lot of support for the changes, with the bulk of the funding coming from the congregation and a lot of the work being done in-house.</p>
      <p>“With all these changes it feels like Stonelaw is well placed for the future.”</p>
      <p>After announcing the news on Twitter, good wishes for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/mixed-reaction-church-leaders-church-12266096">Alistair</a> came in from the community and further afield.</p>
      <p>Calum McLeod, formerly the minister at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/rutherglen-old-parish-church-set-10453557">Rutherglen Old Parish Church</a> , wrote: “You will be missed in Rutherglen. Exciting times! Praying that the realignments and transitions involved will be smooth.”</p>
      <p>David Ramage wrote: “Rutherglen’s loss is Motherwell’s Gain! “</p>
      <p>Graham Atkinson added: “Every blessing in your move.”</p>
