      <p>Following the arrival of several police vehicles, scenes of crime officers then arrived and began to tape off parts of the hotel for further investigation.</p>
      <p>Social media has been rife with unsubstantiated rumours, but one person said that officers from Police Scotland had been “doing door-to-door asking for anyone with CCTV to make it available for viewing” by the investigation team.</p>
      <p>Inspector Rachael Burns of Glenrothes Police Station said: “Officers were called to an address on Balbirnie Street, Markinch on Wednesday, November 20 following the sudden death of a man.</p>
      <p>“The death is being treated as unexplained and inquiries are ongoing.”</p>
