      <h1>Which metal you need in your house according to your zodiac sign</h1>

      <p>We don’t know when mercury’s retrograde is finally going to bow out, but what we do know for certain is that consulting the Zodiac sure does reverse the effects of the retrograde significantly. Here is our very celestial guide of metal accents you can to add to your home decor, immediately, based on your sign!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Iron | Aries, Scorpio, Cancer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bold, outrageous, unique and made of steel best define these signs, much like their birth metal, Iron. Shiny, bright and magnetic, this is a metal that these signs should keep close.</p>
      <p><b>Copper | Taurus, Libra, Aquarius</b> Just like Copper, Taurians, Librans and Aquarians are positive personalities and tend to ward off all evil. There is no better addition to their homes than a door panel finished with copper. Not only is copper a coolant and lucky for these zodiac’s but is also a head-turner every time someone passes by your door!</p>
      <p><b>Bronze | Gemini, Leo, Virgo<br/></b>Flexible, adaptable and bright are words that you will often hear for people with these zodiac signs. Bronze is the only metal that will do justice to personalities as bright as theirs!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gunmetal | Sagittarius, Pisces, Capricorn</b>

      <p>Gunmetal, an alloy of tin, copper and zinc, is everything that we love when it comes to home decor! Lucky for all the Sagittarians, Capricorns and Pisceans out there, they are the three zodiac signs that this metal is most suited for!</p>
