      <p>In an effort to build a strong network of Youth Red Cross (YRC) volunteers in Agency areas, the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam, has constituted a committee comprising officials, members of the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) and staff of the educational institutions to promote Junior and Youth Red Cross activities.</p>
      <p>The committee has been tasked to implement appropriate programmes to popularise Youth Red Cross activities in the educational institutions in all Agency mandals and ensure active involvement of youth in the Red Cross activities particularly promotion of voluntary blood donation.</p>
      <p>ITDA Project Officer V P Gautham held a review meeting with the members of the committee in Bhadrachalam on Tuesday to chart out the modalities for implementation of an action plan to make youth active partners in Red Cross activities to serve the needs of people living in interior tribal areas, sources said.</p>
      <p>The move to promote voluntary blood donation and extend health care services in Agency areas gains importance in the backdrop of the prevalence of nutritional anaemia, and blood disorders such as sickle cell anaemia and Thalassaemia in some remote tribal pockets of the district.</p>
