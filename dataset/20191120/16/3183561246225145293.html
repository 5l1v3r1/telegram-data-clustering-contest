      <p>Bush fire season means that asthmatics have to be extra careful when it comes to being outside.</p>
      <p>The smokey air can lead to unexpected attacks, especially if you tend to mostly suffer for exercise induced asthma.</p>
      <p>This means you might need to buy a ventolin inhaler out of the blue, and it turns out, you don't need a prescription.</p>
      <p>I was diagnosed with asthma when I was kid and it took almost two decades for me to discover I didn't need a prescription to buy an inhaler.</p>
      <p>No doctor or pharmacy told me this until this year, when a pharmacist casually mentioned it. And it seems I'm not the only one who has been labouring under this misapprehension.</p>
      <p>Just this week someone on Twitter reported that their partner was denied an inhaler at a pharmacy because they didn't have a prescription on them. Not an ideal scenario when your asthma is unexpectedly flaring up due to smoke.</p>
      <p>If this ever happens to you, it's best to know your rights.</p>
      <p>Ventolin is a 'Schedule 3' medicine, which according to <a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/scheduling-of-medicines-and-poisons">Health Direct</a> makes it a 'pharmacy only' medicine.</p>
      <p>This means that it is available from a pharmacist without a prescription. Schedule 3 medicines are usually behind the counter so you'll probably have to ask for it. You may also be asked to show your licence, similar to when you buy certain cold &amp; flu tablets.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth remembering that it’s up to a pharmacist’s discretion.</p>
      <p>Speaking to a local pharmacy in Sydney, they told me that they may deny ventolin if their line of questioning reveals that someone isn’t being properly treated for asthma.</p>
      <p>For example, using a ventolin more than four times a week without a preventer.</p>
      <p>I mentioned that my own asthma is generally sports induced and that I don’t use a preventer. I also noted that this leads me to using my puffa four times a week for gym sessions. The pharmacy confirmed they would not deny me a ventolin in this case.</p>
      <p>They did reiterate that pharmacies will differ though, so you may have a different experience depending on where you go. For example, this pharmacist has never worked anywhere that requires a licence to buy ventolin without a prescription.</p>
      <p>If you're someone who uses a Turbuhaler (the twist bottom ones) you will need a prescription as it is categorised as a Schedule 4 'prescription only' medicine.</p>
      <p>Hopefully this saves some people from an unnecessary doctor appointment in the future.</p>
