      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Two people were arrested on tentative charges of disorderly conduct while armed Tuesday night, Madison police said. </p>
      <p>According to an incident report, Larry T. Spinks, 34, and Lakisha M. Crawford, 31, were arrested after DeForest police officers and Dane County Sheriff's deputies performed a high-risk traffic stop in the DeForest area, where the suspects live. </p>
      <p>Officials said people arrived in three separate cars to the 4000 block of East Washington Avenue shortly before 8 p.m. </p>
      <p>The report said one car had a man and woman from Sun Prairie. They reportedly called police when they realized the other people involved brought two guns and a pipe to what they thought was a "fistfight," according to the report. </p>
      <p>Police said the two other cars drove away after police were called. </p>
      <p>Madison police said they searched Spknks' and Crawford's car and found two pipes and a loaded handgun. </p>
      <p>The driver of the other car, who the victims said also brought a gun to the fight, remains at large, according to the report. </p>
