                      <p>“It really hit me on a personal level,” he told reporters, per the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpools-gini-wijnaldum-makes-powerful-17280090">Liverpool Echo</a>. I never expected anything like this to happen in the Netherlands. I’m really shocked. It did happen, unfortunately, and the way people have talked about the incident really hurt me.</p>

                          <p>“It’s a problem in society. As a player, you can’t really change anything about it. But I still think that players should try and support each other. It’s a problem in society and a problem that should be solved by our politicians.” he further said.</p>
