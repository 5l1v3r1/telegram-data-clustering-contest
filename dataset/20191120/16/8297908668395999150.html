      <p>Nothing makes us happier than hearing a client recommend Kraken to others, as a result of their experience trading with us and the sense of independence that comes with owning crypto. </p>
      <p>In appreciation, we want to start rewarding those who spread the good word. Starting today, you can get paid <b>20% of the fees we collect from a referred client (up to $1,000 USD for each client referred)</b>.</p>
      <p>Let’s do the math: </p>
      <p>
        <b>If you refer 500 clients to us, you can earn up to $500,000 USD (i.e. 500 X $1,000)! </b>
      </p>
      <p>Here’s the best part: </p>
      <p><b>This program has no scheduled expiration date</b>. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You get paid for as long as the referral remains a client. We constructed our program this way because we truly believe in growing the market long term. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a huge difference from any other programs which might pay you a higher percentage, but only cover the first 3 months or first year of the clients’ activity. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Our data shows that most clients are active well beyond the first year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That’s all there is to it. </p>
