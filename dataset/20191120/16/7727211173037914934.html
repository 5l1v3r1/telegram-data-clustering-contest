      <h2>"A couple of fellas" were handing out envelopes wanting people to spend it on something to eat</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:51:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-williams/" target="_blank">Olivia Williams</a></address>
      <p>Several mystery men have reportedly been handing out £10 notes along with a letter to lucky shoppers.</p>
      <p>On a post on social media, a woman - who did not want to be named - said her friend received an envelope containing the cash and a letter when she visited The Pyramids shopping centre in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> today.</p>
      <p>The post said that the woman's friend had visited the food court and a "couple of fellas" were walking around handing out envelopes.</p>
      <p>Inside the thoughtful handout contained a £10 note and a letter which said: "Please do not take offence.</p>
      <p>"I just want you to have your bit of food on me regardless of your financial situation. Again please do not take offence."</p>

      <p>The woman who posted on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> said she posted about her friend's 'lucky' encounter as it seemed "bizarre" that they were handing out money and then walking away.</p>
      <p>Her post said: "Seriously none of you are going to believe this, so I hope its happened to you, you put it in here.</p>
      <p>"A friend of mine has just come from the food court in The Pyramids and said a couple of fellas walking around giving out envelopes.</p>
      <p>"Here's what they contain; £10 with a note saying please don't take offence.</p>
      <p>"I'm only posting this as it seems bizarre, that they just give the money and walk away - no questions asked!</p>
      <p>"But I'm also made up as she skipped out the shop in a very happy mood, so get yourself down to The Pyramids for a free meal and yes before you ask the money is real, I checked it."</p>
      <p>Following the post, which was shared on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook,</a> many commented at how generous the gesture was.</p>
      <p>Others were more sceptical about the handouts, however were ensured it was real.</p>
      <p>The gesture comes days after a girl, seven, broke the hearts of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> readers after sending <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/desperate-child-7-writes-note-17273049">a letter to Santa</a> asking for food and a house for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The letter read: "Dear Father Christmas. Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Mam wants us to be all together, can you give us some food and can I just have just nice doll for Christmas. Thank you."</p>
      <p>Local Labour councillor, Gerard Woodhouse who runs the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">L6 Community Centre</a> , on Queens Road, Everton posted a photo on Twitter of the hand-written note asking Santa for help.</p>
      <p>Cllr Woodhouse said the letter shows the reality at how much some families in Merseyside are struggling.</p>
      <p>He  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO:</a>  "This is what we're in sadly. What is upsetting is a seven-year-old in November is already worrying about Christmas.</p>
      <p>"No wonder young people have mental health problems, it's just so sad.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately it is what we see at the L6 centre.</p>
      <p>"This is just one of many that we're going to see from now until Christmas."</p>
      <p>The councillor said he and the L6 centre team are trying their best to help the family with basic needs such as accommodation and food.</p>
