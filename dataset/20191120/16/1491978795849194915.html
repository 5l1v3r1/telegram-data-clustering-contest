        <i>Reports suggest director set to make followup to box office hit</i>
      </p>
      <p>Last weekend, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/joker">Joker</a> – Todd Phillips’s origins story about Batman’s nemesis – passed $1bn at the global box office, having already beaten Deadpool to become the highest-grossing R-rated film ever.</p>
      <p>Talk of a sequel has been rife since the film’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/joker-review-twisted-tour-de-force-joaquin-phoenix">critically acclaimed premiere at the Venice film festival</a> in August, but confirmation has proved elusive.</p>
      <p>But a new <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">article in the Hollywood Reporter</a> suggests that such a project is now in final-stage discussion, with the publication asserting that Phillips and Phoenix are “likely to reteam”.</p>
      <p>The director will write the screenplay to the sequel along with co-writer Scott Silver, with whom he worked on the original’s script, sources told the Hollywood Reporter. The initial box office numbers scored by Joker were enough for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/warner-bros">Warner Bros</a> to agree to Phillips’s request to direct another DC Comics origins story – tipped to be Lex Luthor. Batman is already being shot by Matt Reeves, with Robert Pattinson in the lead.</p>
      <p>Three previous DC titles have made more than $1bn, but Joker’s comparatively small budget ($60m) has increased its impact. The Hollywood Reporter’s sources say that Phillips stands to make around $100m from his work on the film, having struck a backend percentage profit share deal similar to one he negotiated for The Hangover (which cost $35m and made $468m).</p>
