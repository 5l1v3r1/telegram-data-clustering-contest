      <p>November 20 is the feast day of St Edmund and across Suffolk the flag bearing the crown and arrows motif of the county's own saint was flying high.</p>
      <p>In Bury St Edmunds, the town that bears his name, shops, businesses and market traders were flying the flags and bunting in his name.</p>
      <p>Mike Kirkham of the Bury St Edmunds Business Improvement District said it had distributed more than 50 flags and 250 metres of bunting around the town.</p>
      <p>"The town has been very enthusiastic, there is a very strong allegiance here to St Edmund as you might imagine," he said.</p>

      <p>"Businesses across the board have been very supportive, the market traders have done us proud as have the Arc, the Apex and the independents."</p>
      <p>St Edmund was an ancient king of East Anglia martyred on November 20 in 869AD by the Vikings.</p>
      <p>Legend has it he sacrificed himself rather than renounce Christ or become a token king.</p>

      <p>He was tied to a tree and shot with arrows before being decapitated - Hoxne, near Eye, Hellesden and Bradfield St Clare all have claims to be the place where he died.</p>
      <p>One miracle attributed to Saint Edmund tells the story of a blind man with a boy who sheltered overnight in a chapel who left in the morning with his eyesight restored.</p>
      <p>Edmund is the patron saint of Kings, pandemics, the diocese of East Anglia, Douai Abbey, wolves, torture victims, and protection from the plague.</p>
      <p>Edmund was also patron saint of England during the Middle Ages, and nearly 200 years after his death a magnificent abbey was built by King Canute to house his remains.</p>
      <p>However the abbey and his shrine were destroyed in 1539 during the reformation.</p>
      <p>His remains were lost, although one theory is they are under the tennis courts that are in the town's Abbey gardens which are on the site of the abbey.</p>
      <p>The Abbey 1000 celebrations were launched this month to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the founding of the abbey, with events taking place in Bury St Edmunds throughout 2020.</p>
