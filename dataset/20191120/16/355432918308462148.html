      <h1>Trump unlikely to testify in impeachment probe, White House aide says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:09:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p>White House aide Pam Bondi said Wednesday that she believes it's unlikely <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> will testify in the impeachment inquiry, despite the president claiming earlier this week he's "strongly considering it."</p>
      <p>“I know why he wants to testify. Of course he wants to testify, he did nothing wrong," Bondi <a href="https://twitter.com/CBSThisMorning/status/1197142890008514561">said on "CBS This Morning."</a></p>
      <p>"But do I think it’s likely he’s going to testify? Probably not," she continued. "No one would advise him to testify because this is a sham court.”</p>
      <p>Bondi, who joined the White House in recent days to help manage messaging on impeachment, said she personally did not think Trump should testify. She argued that "no human being should have to come in and prove their innocence, ever."</p>
      <p>Trump said Monday he would "strongly consider" giving in-person or written testimony in the impeachment inquiry into whether he abused his office and pressured a foreign government to investigate his domestic political rivals.</p>
      <p>Despite his proclamation, it was unlikely Trump would follow through. His White House has steadfastly refused to cooperate with the House probe to date, blocking aides from testifying or providing documentation.</p>
      <p>Trump previously said during former special counsel <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a>'s investigation that he would sit for an interview, only to provide Mueller with written answers to several questions. Trump's attorneys fought against an in-person interview after expressing concerns it could be a "perjury trap" for a president who often exaggerates or makes inaccurate statements.</p>
