      <p>The nominations for the 2020 Grammy Awards have been announced. The upcoming year’s contenders celebrate a host of potential first-time winners, especially in Rap and Hip-Hop.</p>
      <p>In the “Best Album Category,” there are several key contenders. Notably, J. Cole (who has never previously won a Grammy) earned that distinction with his entire squad and <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/dreamville-rotd3-dreamers-documentary-video/">Dreamville’s <i>Revenge Of The Dreamers III</i></a>. Between 2012 and 2019, Cole was nominated seven times without a win. The announcement comes one year after many fans felt Cole was snubbed for <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2018/12/j-cole-kod-snubbed-by-grammys/">2018’s omission surrounding <i>KOD</i></a>. This chart-topping compilation’s nomination belongs to a crew that also includes Bas, J.I.D., Omen, EarthGang, Cozz, Ari Lennox, and Lute. A host of guests joined the fold, including Reason, Buddy, Vince Staple, Ty Dolla $ign, Guapdad4000, DaBaby, Saba, King Mez, Baby Rose, Smokepurpp, Ski Mask The Slump God, Smino, Reese La Flare, Mereba, Deante Hitchcock, Dreezy, and Maxo Kream, among others.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Also in the category are YBN Cordae for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6Pb7PMZtW0fuEM1lCGvCDu?si=o-8A8cM_Tl6s-oyjWFjHFA"><i>The Lost Boy</i></a>, 21 Savage for late 2018’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/007DWn799UWvfY1wwZeENR?si=c5PUoAOZRnGFutCg15yFeA"><i>I Am &gt; I Was</i></a>, Tyler, The Creator for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5zi7WsKlIiUXv09tbGLKsE?si=3ArgOJ6VRUORylHBeqrKMg"><i>IGOR</i></a>, and Meek Mill for one year ago’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6UYZEYjpN1DYRW0kqFy9ZE?si=3q7Egp9YTxWPt7UCzDNVXQ"><i>Championships</i></a>. Cordae and Meek are first-time nominees. 21 previously was nominated last year for his Post Malone collaboration. The rapper did not attend due to <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/02/21-savage-interview-ice-gma/">an arrest by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a>. In 2018, Tyler was nominated for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2nkto6YNI4rUYTLqEwWJ3o?si=AjMW3jHRSZyzNNJBxTXAdg"><i>Flower Boy</i></a>, as well as a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/392p3shh2jkxUxY2VHvlH8?si=F7x0z18ATXqQ-PD-4rdFGQ">c<i>hannel ORANGE</i></a> nod alongside Frank Ocean in 2013.</p>
      <p>In the “Best Rap Song” category, Cordae and previous Grammy winner Chance The Rapper are nominated for <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/06/chance-the-rapper-ybn-cordae-rap-song-video/">“Bad Idea.”</a> Rick Ross’ latest Drake collabo’ <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/07/drake-rick-ross-kevin-durant-lyric-gold-roses/">“Gold Roses”</a> is included. DaBaby’s JetsonMade-produced hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvuQNNVrbtM">“Suge (Yea Yea)”</a> joins the fold, as does late <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAcGg_4KKYs">Nipsey Hussle’s “Racks In The Middle,”</a> featuring Hit-Boy and protege Roddy Ricch. Cole and 21 Savage share a nomination with 2018’s video single <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/02/j-cole-21-savage-video/">“a lot.”</a> Although nominated for “Best Rap Album” and in attendance this year, Nipsey never won a Grammy ahead of <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2019/03/nipsey-hussle-struck-marathon/">his March, 2019 murder</a>. This category could potentially mark first-time wins for Ross, Cordae, Cole, and 21.</p>
