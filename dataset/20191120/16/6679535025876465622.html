      <p>Every citizen is responsible for safeguarding the rights of the children, especially those from the distressed sections and orphans, said District Collector M. Haritha.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the valedictory ceremony of Child Rights Week here on Wednesday, she said it was high time to focus on protecting child rights.</p>
      <p>“Without the active participation of people, it is difficult for the line departments concerned to implement the provisions of child rights. What we need is a coordinated effort from all the departments and all sections of people to deal with maladies such as female infanticide, child trafficking, child marriages among others,” the Collector said.</p>
      <h3>Awareness campaigns</h3>
      <p>Ms. Haritha further said people should be compassionate towards children who are deprived of family love and affection. She emphasised on the need for conducting awareness campaigns about childline 1098 service, the toll-free helpline for children in distress, and 104 services that offer medical health support services (MHSS) to them. On the occasion, she was all praise for line departments in charge of the welfare of women and children for working efficiently. DLSA Secretary G.V. Maheshnath said they have plans to organise coordination meetings for the line departments to achieve better results.</p>
      <h3>Sensitising people</h3>
      <p>Emphasising the role of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in safeguarding the rights of children, its Chairperson Mandala Parashuramulu said, “Children are nation’s most valuable assets, hence we have to rededicate ourselves to implement child rights effectively”. He also stressed on the need for organising awareness programmes for sensitising people on child rights, education, health and hygiene.</p>
      <p>DCPO G. Mahender Reddy explained the activities organised by the Warangal Rural District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) for children.</p>
      <p>Later, the Collector gave away mementoes and certificates of appreciation to 165 students who excelled in sports competitions organised by the district administration as part of Child Rights Week.</p>
      <p>The Mondrai ZP High School students, who presented a mock assembly, also come in for appreciation.</p>
