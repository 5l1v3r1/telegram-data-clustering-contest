      <p>In recent years, private markets have boomed while public markets have bounced along. Some industry followers describe initial public offerings more of an exit opportunity than a point when retail investors can join along. Examples such as the Wework debacle do not help the narrative.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fintech and digitization of all financial services have fueled a boom in innovation. This includes online capital formation.</p>
      <p>The SEC is currently reviewing the exemption ecosystem, as described by a concept release, and considering potential changes to current rules. Expect some of the discourse to tackle the concept release topics.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The event will also be live-streamed on the SEC website.</b>
