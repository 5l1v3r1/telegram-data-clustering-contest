      <p>Jussie Smollett is now suing the city of Chicago for malicious prosecution, after it was claimed he staged a fake racist and homophobic attack on himself earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Back in January, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/empire-tv-series/">Empire</a> actor <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/01/jussie-smollett-breaks-silence-horrific-incident-vows-lead-love-8426581/">claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack</a>, alleging he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/29/empire-actor-jussie-smollet-brutally-beaten-attacked-bleach-possible-hate-crime-8410252/">beaten by two men who put a noose</a> around his neck and screamed racial slurs.</p>
      <p>He was later charged with making a false police report after officials said the attack was staged, with brothers Abel and Ola Osundairo coming forward to claim he paid them to help fake his ordeal.</p>
      <p>Cheques the 37-year-old made out to the pair later emerged, and he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/08/jussie-smollett-indicted-16-felony-counts-filing-false-police-report-8874272/">was charged with 16 felonies</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite being indicted by a grand jury, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/26/jussie-smollett-charges-dropped-false-police-report-case-9029997/">State Attorney later dropped all charges</a>.</p>
      <p>Jussie has always pleaded his innocence, and has now accused officials and police officers in Chicago of a smear campaign against him.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/jussie-smollett-sues-city-of-chicago-malicious-prosecution-eddie-johnson/">TMZ – who obtained the lawsuit</a> – reports that it states the brothers only made the allegations once they were promised immunity.</p>
      <p>He also insisted they were lured into a smear campaign by police, claiming his attacker was a white male.</p>
      <p>Jussie also maintained the cheque he gave the Osundairos was for their services as personal trainers, helping him get into shape for a music video.</p>
      <p>However, the City previously started legal action against Taraji P Henson’s co-star, suing him for the cost of the investigation.</p>
      <p>Officials have requested $130,000 (£99k) to cover their funds, including the ‘overtime worked by more than two dozen detectives and officers’.</p>
      <p>After he missed the deadline, the city is now requesting nearly $400,000 from him.</p>
