      <h1>Apollo Tyres cutting capex by ₹600 cr.: CFO</h1>
      <h2>Move follows slowdown in auto sector</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:55:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Following the slowdown in the automobile sector, Apollo Tyres Ltd. (ATL) is cutting down on its planned capital expenditure (capex) for FY20 and FY21 together by ₹600 crore, said a top executive of the company.</p>
      <p>For the current fiscal, the tyre major had lined up capex of ₹2,700 crore, a majority of which was to be invested in the greenfield Andhra Pradesh plant.</p>
      <p>Talking to analysts and investors in a conference call, Gaurav Kumar, chief financial officer, ATL, said: “We have already started implementing that [cutting capex]. So, the capex, particularly for the A.P. greenfield, would have slowed down from our earlier plan. We will cut close to ₹600 crore of capex over the current year and the next year.”</p>
      <p>He said for FY20 and FY21, the firm had planned capex of about ₹2,700 crore and ₹1,700 crore respectively. This would come down to about ₹2,300-₹2,400 crore for this year and by ₹300 crore for the next fiscal.</p>
      <h3>Poor demand</h3>
      <p>“The commissioning of the plant will happen in the first quarter of 2020, but ramping up of the A.P. plant’s capacity will happen slowly. However, it would not impact us since there is no demand,” he added.</p>
      <p>On overseas production, he said the company’s Hungary plant would produce over three million tyres in the current year, followed by over four million in the next year.</p>
