      <p>SMYRNA, Tenn. - A Tennessee father who's accused of leaving his 3-year-old son in a hot car in July is now charged with murder.</p>
      <p>News outlets cited court records in reporting that a grand jury handed down an indictment this month adding the charge against 23-year-old Dylan Levesque.</p>
      <p>The panel also indicted him on an aggravated child abuse and neglect charge originally filed by police in July.</p>
      <p>Smyrna Police Chief Kevin Arnold has said Daylin Palmer was found unresponsive in a car at a home. He says officers tried to revive the boy but were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>The autopsy ruled the child's death was due to a high body temperature and accidental.</p>
      <p>Court records don't list an attorney for Levesque.</p>
