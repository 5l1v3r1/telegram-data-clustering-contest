      <p>The smartphone may be the first Nokia smartphone to be powered by a Unisoc processor has passed Bluetooth certification. The Bluetooth certification reveals the Bluetooth 4.2 specs, LTE support and also the fact that it is powered by a Unisoc processor that is generally used on entry-level smartphones.</p>
      <p>So far nothing else is known about this smartphone other than the fact that is an <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/unknown-nokia-smartphone-ta-1209-nokia-5-2-passes-certification-in-india/">India-bound</a> device, as its appearence in BIS certification revealed.</p>
      <p>Since, we recently saw Nokia 2.3 appearing in <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-2-3/">various leaks</a> most of them posted by us exclusively. So, is it the Nokia 1.2 or Nokia 1.3 that we are looking at. HMD may have shortened its product launch cycle by six weeks when it comes to the entry-level smartphones.</p>
