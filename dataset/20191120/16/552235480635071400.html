      <p>Brian McLuckie reckons Irvine Victoria are proving great value for money this season despite their Championship struggles.</p>
      <p>The Westenders' boss was put through the mill on Saturday as his side played out a thrilling 3-3 draw at home to Dalry.</p>
      <p>Vics blew a two goal-lead against their North Ayrshire neighbours and needed a last-gasp David Smith strike to rescue a point.</p>
      <p>The result mirrored the score-line in their last home league match against Cambuslang Rangers on October 19.</p>
      <p>And McLuckie joked:"You certainly get your money's worth at Victoria Park these days, that's for sure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I thought we were very good in the first half and we maybe could have scored another one or two.</p>
      <p>"Dalry were better in the second half though so we can't be too disappointed with a point."</p>
      <p>Vics looked like they might end a 14 game winless run when Calum McDade and Jonny Baxter netted quickfire goals in the lead up to half time.</p>

      <p>But they conceded early in the second half, on loan Buffs striker Mark Curragh forcing the ball home after a goalmouth scramble.</p>
      <p>Scott Gray then dinked Vics goalkeeper Jamie Walker in 70 minutes to level the scores before Sam McCloy put the visitors ahead with four minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Dalry were just seconds away from holding onto all three points when Vics full back David Smith popped up in the box to poke home a late leveller.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Vics hit the road this weekend with a trip to Barrhead to face an Arthurlie side who knocked them out the West of Scotland Cup a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>McLuckie added: "We need to improve our away form."</p>
