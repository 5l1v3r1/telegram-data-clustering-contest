      <p><b>TL;DR: </b><a href="https://zdcs.link/mxm55">Charging devices and phone accessories</a> are up to 52% off at Amazon ahead of Black Friday.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Unless you're some sort of superhuman who can go without technology, you probably have your phone on you at all times and like for it to be charged. </p>
      <p>I almost always have a portable charger handy and it has been a lifesaver. (I am directionally challenged and often rely on Google Maps.)</p>
      <p>Amazon currently has a selection of portable chargers, wireless chargers, charging cables, and car phone mounts <a href="https://zdcs.link/mxm55">on sale</a> as one of its deals of the day. </p>
      <p>If you have a phone or other tech devices compatible with wireless charging, there are some nice Qi-certified wireless chargers on sale for really affordable prices. Grab a <a href="https://zdcs.link/nn6bl">Belkin wireless charging pad</a> for just $23.99 or an <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8VKZ">iOttie wireless charging stand</a> for $25.97. </p>
      <p>If you don't have devices that charge wirelessly, check out the external batteries and charging cables included in the sale. And regardless of how your phone charges, you can pop it into one of the phone mounts on sale for super cheap. (These all make great <a href="https://mashable.com/gifts/best-stocking-stuffers/">stocking stuffers</a>, BTW.)</p>
      <p>Are you sick of hearing the word charger yet? Just <a href="https://zdcs.link/mxm55">head to Amazon</a> and buy one so you can stop reading about them.</p>
