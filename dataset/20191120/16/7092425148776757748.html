      <p>The onslaught of new models from Ducati for 2020 shows no sign of letting up — as the company introduced the latest additions to its line-up.</p>
      <p>Following the Streetfighter V4, the Panigale V4 gets some of the trick bits from the range-topping V4 R.</p>
      <p>These will include larger side vents for better cooling, lateral wings and a Plexiglas screen, while the Front Frame design gains more stiffness to improve front-end feel.</p>

      <p>Below that is the new Panigale V2, which gets a whole new look while also becoming more comfortable for sports riders thanks to a new seat design and a more compliant suspension setup.</p>
      <p>It gets a single-sided swingarm and a neat under-engine exhaust with a side-mounted silencer. Power from the 955cc Superquadro motor comes in at 155hp and 104Nm of torque.</p>
      <p>For the trendy folk around town, the Scrambler range gains a new Icon Dark model serving as the entry-point to the line-up.</p>
      <p>Ducati also gave a preview of two Scrambler concepts that are due to debut at EICMA 2019 later this month.</p>

      <p>New colour schemes for the Diavel 1260 gives it an ever sexier look than ever before.</p>
      <p>A mean-looking Dark Stealth is available on the standard version and is undoubtedly on Batman’s Christmas list.</p>
      <p>Ducati has also added a new Red with white rims colour scheme for the sportier S model.</p>
      <p>For the globetrotters, the Multistrada 1260 S Grand Tour is ideally kitted out to let you comfortably and quickly cover some far-flung adventures.</p>
