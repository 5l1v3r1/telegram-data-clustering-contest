      <p>After two years of waiting, we’re finally getting season 4, and, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/rick-morty-season-4-reviews-will-give-marvels-chris-evans-lot-excited-11063772/">some great reviews</a> under its belt, the hype is very real.</p>
      <p>For anyone not in the know, the series follows a drunken and amoral genius as he goes on darkly comic adventures with his timid non-genius grandson.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the series 4 premiere, here’s everything you need to know about the new season…</p>

      <p>Episode one of season four is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/rick-morty-channel-stream-online-11187616/">kicking off at 10pm on E4</a>.</p>
      <p>The initial UK release date was set to be in January 2020, however fans did not take kindly to the delay.</p>
      <p>This led to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/rick-morty-season-4-uk-release-date-moved-next-week-fan-demand-11079687/">season 4’s new November premiere,</a> with Ian Katz, Director of Programmes at Channel 4 saying: ‘When we announced we would be airing Rick and Morty Series 4 on free to air TV in January we thought fans would be delighted.</p>
      <p>‘Instead they told us – in their droves – that it wasn’t nearly soon enough, so we’ve listened and brought forward the UK premiere to November 20th on E4 and All 4. Enjoy!’</p>
