      <p>A bar patron in England claims that another customer sent him a racist food order.</p>
      <p>The Richmal Crompton has an app that allows customers to order an item off the menu and have it sent to any table in the establishment. Mark D’arcy-Smith, a black man, says that he was visiting the establishment with a friend when a waiter suddenly brought over a banana.</p>
      <p>“We both looked at each other then looked at the banana,” D’arcy-Smith told South West News Service, a British news agency. “It clicked that it wasn’t ours. It was clearly sent by someone who was trying to be racist. My friend went to talk to a staff member but they didn’t see what the issue was. He said: ‘Do you know what’s wrong here?’”</p>
      <p>According to D’arcy-Smith, the staff initially thought they had just brought over an incorrect order.</p>

      <p>“I was sat on my own at this point,” he continued. “I looked around to see if I could spot anyone. I got anxious. I think someone sent it because it was anonymous. Two girls came over and asked if I was okay, if I was going to stay.”</p>
      <p>The incident and the staff’s response has left D’arcy-Smith feeling unwanted and uncomfortable at the bar.</p>
      <p>“When I walked past [the other day] I had this weird moment,” he said. “My hands were shaking and my palms were sweating. I don’t think I was very comfortable. I had hoped they [Wetherspoon] would take the situation seriously. They just treated it like other incidents – like a bar fight.”</p>
      <p>In a statement obtained by SWNS, a spokesman for the company that runs the bar said, “We apologize to the customer and appreciate the distress caused. This is now a police matter. We have responded to the customer and pointed out that the pub cannot be held responsible for app orders.”</p>
