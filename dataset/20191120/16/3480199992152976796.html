      <p>Boris Johnson has hinted more than 2 million low-paid workers could be lifted out of National Insurance under plans to be unveiled in the Tories’ election manifesto.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister appeared to blurt out the scheme to raise the threshold at which workers start paying National Insurance contributions (NICs) from £8,628 a year to £12,000 during a campaign visit to Teesside.</p>
      <p>The disclosure came as Tories came under fire for re-branding one of their official Twitter accounts as a fact-check service during Tuesday’s TV debate between Mr Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats meanwhile launched their election manifesto with a promise of a £50 billion “Remain bonus” for public services if they succeed in their aim of stopping Brexit.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a question-and-answer session with workers at an engineering plant in Middlesbrough, Mr Johnson said the Conservatives were committed to a policy of “low tax for… the working people”.</p>
      <p>He went on: “If you look at what we’re doing and what I’ve said in the last few days, we are going to be cutting National Insurance up to £12,000, we are going to be making sure that we cut business rates for small businesses.</p>
      <p>“We are cutting tax for working people.”</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson originally proposed raising the NIC threshold during the Conservative leadership contest last summer – although at that stage he did not put a figure on it.</p>
      <p>However the Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that a plan by his then leadership rival Dominic Raab to lift it to £12,500 would take 2.4 million workers out of NICs.</p>
      <p>It put the cost to the Exchequer at between £11 billion and £17 billion depending on whether the threshold for employers was raised along with those for employees and the self-employed.</p>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said that while the cost to the public purse would be significant, those on low incomes would see little benefit.</p>

      <p>“Even after 10 years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of £1.64 a week, with those on Universal Credit getting about 60p.</p>
      <p>“Meanwhile independent experts have said this will cost up to £11 billion so everyone who relies on public services and social security will be wondering whether they will be paying the price.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson insisted the party’s “ambitious” manifesto plans to tackle the climate change “crisis”, invest in schools and extend free childcare showed they were more than a “one-trick pony” dedicated to stopping Brexit.</p>
      <p>However, she told the PA news agency: “All of those things, absolutely, become much easier to do if we stop Brexit and have the benefits of remaining in the European Union.”</p>
