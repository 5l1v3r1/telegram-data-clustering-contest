      <h1>Initial Betting Line Released For Alabama-Auburn Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:29:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, Alabama star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury that put his career in jeopardy. As Tua attempted to escape two Mississippi State defenders, he was tackled and dislocated his hip.</p>
      <p>He also suffered a fracture, which will cost him the rest of the season. Initial reports suggested the injury could be career-threatening, but recent reports suggest he will make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>With Tua gone, the Crimson Tide turn to backup quarterback Mac Jones. Despite losing Tagovailoa for the season, Alabama remained at No. 5 in the most recent College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>However, Las Vegas thinks Jones is a significant downgrade at the quarterback position. The Crimson Tide are just 2.5-point favorites against Auburn in the final week of the regular season.</p>

      <p>Auburn fell at home against Georgia last weekend, officially ending any shot the Tigers had at the College Football Playoff. However, they can still play spoiler in the final week of the regular season if they take down the Crimson Tide.</p>
      <p>Mac Jones has looked solid this season, but those performances came against inferior opponents. Heâ€™ll face a much tougher test in two weeks as he lines up against Derrick Brown and company.</p>
      <p>Can the Tigers pull the upset?</p>
