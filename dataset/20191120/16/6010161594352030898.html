      <p>With Shenmue 3 out, Yu Suzuki wants to continue telling Ryo’s story in Shenmue 4.</p>
      <p><b>Shenmue 3</b> was released this week, and in an open letter to fans at the end of the game’s credits, Yu Suzuki said he wants to complete the Shenmue story.</p>
      <p>“For as long as there are those who wish to see Shenmue live on, I will never give up on my own personal journey to complete its story,” he said (via <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/shenmue-4-next-focus-yu-suzuki-vows-never-give-series-11188056/">Metro UK</a>). “As with Shenmue 3, the Shenmue story is with you.</p>
      <p>“I sincerely hope that, together, we can continue to spin the tale of Ryo and his adventures in Shenmue 4.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ahcwf/i_am_yu_suzuki_new_posting/">In a reddit AMA four years ago</a>, Suzuki said there were a total of “11 chapters that make up the whole story.” He had originally planned to make the Shenmue series span four or five games but if at all possible, he would “still like to realize the full story of 11 chapters.”</p>
