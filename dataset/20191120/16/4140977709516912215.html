          <p>India will head for West Indies series after the completion of the 2nd Test match in Kolkata, and this will be the final series where Chief selector of BCCI will be contributing towards the formation of the squad as his term is coming to an end.</p>
          <p>India is set to face West Indies in 3 ODIs and 3 T20Is. India’s squads for both the series will be announced on 21st November.

                <p>Rohit has continuously been playing in all three formats for India, the Indian opener has played around 60 matches in across all competitions in 2019 and certainly needs rest.</p>
                <p>Skipper Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and other main players who are playing all three formats are already getting rest and with this, the vice-captain of India also has a case.</p>

                      <p>Moreover, Shikhar Dhawan can also be dropped by the selection team considering his poor form and Mayank Agarwal can be brought in as a replacement who has been <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/mayank-agarwal-double-century-watch-virat-kohli-gestures-agarwal-to-score-triple-century-in-indore-test/">impressive in the test format</a> so far.</p>
                      <p>On the other hand, MS Dhoni is also reported to make a comeback in the Indian contingent. He has constantly declared himself unavailable for the national team and even <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/watch-msk-prasad-opens-up-on-ms-dhonis-future-as-international-cricketer/">BCCI did not look forward to his participation</a> in an attempt to groom to Rishabh Pant.</p>

                            <p>But now BCCI reportedly looks to add Dhoni as a mentor to youngsters in the team including Pant, who has been underwhelming since the end of the ICC World Cup 2019.</p>
                            <p>Further, Dhoni can be added in the T20 lineups as he is still an asset behind the wicket and can be explosive in the death overs.</p>
