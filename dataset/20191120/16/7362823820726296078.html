      <h1>Dolly Parton speaks about goddaughter Miley Cyrus: 'Miley has such gifts'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:34:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Sahadeo</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/dolly-parton">Dolly Parton</a> is opening up about her goddaughter <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/miley-cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> and noted that “she’s got good stuff in her.”</p>
      <p>Parton, 73, spoke about her 26-year-old goddaughter and had nothing but lavish praise for the “Wrecking Ball” singer in a new interview.</p>
      <p>“Lord, I’ve done everything, and what I ain’t done, I intend to,” the country music legend told <a href="https://people.com/country/dolly-parton-goddaughter-miley-cyrus-knows-what-shes-doing/">People</a>. “She’s going to do that, too. But Miley’s smart; Miley knows what she’s doing. I know we think she doesn’t, and she might not every minute, but I still know that she’s got good stuff in her.”</p>

      <p>Parton also said that she’d rather “live an example” instead of telling Cyrus what and what not to do.</p>
      <p>“I’ve told her some things that I think are valuable and that she uses, but I’d rather live an example,” she said. “[I’d rather] be an example rather than just try to tell somebody to do this, do that because I don’t think that’s right.</p>
      <p>“Everybody’s different. You’ve got your own journey. And some people are going to help you along the way and they can kick a few rocks out of the road for you, but you got to walk it,” Parton continued.</p>

      <p>In October, Parton held a press conference at her Dollywood DreamMore Resort in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. to promote her new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/netflix">Netflix</a> series, “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dolly-parton-heartstrings-jolene-julianne-hough-photos-netflix">Dolly Parton’s Heartstrings</a>.” During the press conference, Parton offered more insight into her relationship with Cyrus and told reporters that her goddaughter "is going to be great."</p>
      <p>“Miley has such gifts, and I think she’s going to be great. Now other people say, ‘You need to talk to Miley.’ I say, ‘No, I don’t. Miley will be Miley, I’ll be me and everybody needs to do their own thing.'”</p>
