      <h1>Every movie and show coming to Netflix in December</h1>
      <h2>Follow Polygon online:</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:19:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:19</time> by <a rel="author">Petrana Radulovic</a></address>
      <p>Even with Netflix’s recommendation algorithm steadily serving you new movies, new TV shows and original programming tailored to your binging habits, the streaming service’s firehose of content makes what’s coming and going difficult to parse.</p>
      <p>That’s why we break down each month’s additions with a spotlight on what to keep on your radar. Netflix’s own “new releases” category is an info dump. Consider us a picture-in-picture talking head, screaming recommendations at the screen.</p>
      <p>After a pretty blustering November, Netflix’s December releases are a little more quiet — but not without some big names. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/20/20813865/marriage-story-trailer-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-netflix-movie"><i>Marriage Story</i> </a>and <i>The Two Popes </i>debut on the platform this month, along with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/31/20940302/netflix-witcher-trailer-release-date-bathtub-geralt-meme">epic fantasy series <i>The Witcher</i></a><i>. </i>A flurry of international titles and true crime documentaries also drop, along with mid-2000s kiddie cult classic <i>Sharkboy and Lavagirl</i>. And of course, who could forget the third installment in the Christmas Prince series?</p>

Frustrated with the direction of the church, Cardinal Bergoglio (Jonathan Pryce) requests permission to retire in 2012 from Pope Benedict (Anthony Hopkins). Instead, facing scandal and self-doubt, the introspective Pope Benedict summons his harshest critic and future successor to Rome to reveal a secret that would shake the foundations of the Catholic Church. Behind Vatican walls, a struggle commences between both tradition and progress, guilt and forgiveness, as these two very different men confront their pasts in order to find common ground and forge a future for a billion followers around the world. Inspired by true events.</p>

      <p><i>From Netflix: </i>Emmy Award Winning Comedian John Mulaney aims to recapture the magic of that bygone television era when children sang songs about their feelings with celebrity guests on funky outdoor sets. The result: <i>John Mulaney &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch</i>.</p>
      <p>I’m John Mulaney and I am a 37 year old man. The Sack Lunch Bunch is a group of children ages 8-13 who are more talented than me. In this special, we are joined by celebrity guests like David Byrne, Tony Award Winner Andre De Shields, Natasha Lyonne, Annaleigh Ashford, Richard Kind, and Jake Gyllenhaal from the movie Zodiac. The result is a collage of Broadway caliber showstoppers, comedy sketches for all ages, meditations on the unknown from children and adults, and a papier mache volcano.It’s funny, musical, joyous, anxious, and surprisingly profound.</p>
