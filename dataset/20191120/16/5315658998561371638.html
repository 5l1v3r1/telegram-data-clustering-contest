      <p>Title: Microsoft 365 admin center access issue <br/>Start time: November 20, 2019, at 1:26 AM UTC <br/>Next update by: November 20, 2019, at 4:30 AM UTC</p>
      <p>More info: We've identified that users may intermittently experience this problem with the Microsoft 365 admin center, Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Intune, Skype for Business, and Yammer.</p>
      <p>While Microsoft Intune is also affected by this issue, Intune admins are able to work around the impact by accessing portal.azure.com.</p>
      <p>This is not a confirmed method of alternative access for other affected Microsoft 365 services.</p>
      <p>Current status: We've identified that a recent networking update may have caused user traffic coming from the internet to fail intermittently before reaching Microsoft 365 services.</p>
      <p>We've reverted this update and are seeing some initial signs of mitigation.</p>
      <p>We're continuing to validate the cause of the problem while we monitor the environment for service recovery.</p>
