      <p>Rapman has opened up about leaving his hometown as a result of ‘jealousy’.</p>
      <p>The star, who grew up in Deptford, features Lewisham and Peckham prominently in his new movie Blue Story after the success of his viral YouTube sensation Shiro’s Story.</p>
      <p>However, chatting to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, he revealed that not everyone had the kindest reaction to his newfound fame.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t live in the Lewisham borough anymore. I think anyone you speak to, who’s getting successful, doesn’t live in their hometown anymore,’ he explained.</p>

      <p>‘It’s only because, if you grew up in an area that’s poverty-driven, if you’re now successful and you’re not really stuck in poverty, they’re going to be jealous. Human nature is jealousy sometimes.’</p>
      <p>The star – real name Andrew Onwubolu – pointed out: ‘Some people are super happy for me. A lot of people are praising me and can’t believe it, they’re inspired.</p>

      <p>‘But there’s a small group that are like, “What have you done for me? You’re making this amount of money, I’m assuming, you’re this famous, what about us?”</p>
      <p>‘I’m a person that cuts away from negativity, I don’t want to be in confrontation with anyone over my career, so I’d just rather live in peace.’</p>
      <p>Despite his success from Shiro’s Story, Blue Story was actually one of Rapman’s first projects, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/rapman-teases-shiros-story-feature-film-admits-new-movie-blue-story-isnt-people-want-11181176/">and he classes it as the one closest to his heart.</a></p>

      <p>‘Everyone – every single person, even some now – wants Shiro’s Story [as a feature film],’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘Blue Story was like 2013 so they’re like “You’ve just done this thing that’s trending all over the world, why are you doing something else? That’s a bit weird, why are you not doing what the people want?”’</p>
      <p>He insisted: ‘I knew that [Blue Story] was closer to my heart. Right now, as soon as I had the platform, I knew this is what I wanted to do.’</p>
      <p>The movie follows the friendship between Timmy and Marco, who are drawn into opposing sides of a postcode war, with tragic and violent consequences.</p>
