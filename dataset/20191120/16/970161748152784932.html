      <p>A partially blind woman has warned of the dangers of electric vehicles after a frightening near-miss.</p>
      <p>Debra Roffey, 52, and her five-year-old guide dog Crystal were almost hit by one of the near silent cars on the seafront at Paignton, Devon in November 2017.</p>
      <p>She was completely unaware of the approaching vehicle and was pulled away with her pet by a passer-by.</p>
      <p>Now Debra is backing Vision Express’ Stop Look Listen campaign, which emphasises the importance of double checking the coast is clear before crossing the road.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘There was no warning. There was no noise and no fumes from an exhaust so Crystal didn’t pick up on the fact there was a car behind us on the seafront pathway.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve nothing against electric cars but they should all have sound systems so people know they are there.’</p>
      <p>Debra, from Lamerton, Tavistock, Devon, suffers from optical atrophy and has 10 per cent vision in her left eye and is completely blind in the right one.</p>
      <p>Vision Express commissioned a survey for Road Safety Week which found 76 per cent of people feel unsafe because of quiet electric and hybrid cars, 250,000 of which are on UK roads.</p>
      <p>The poll of 2,000 people was carried out between November 12 and 15.</p>
      <p>It also found one in five people has experienced a collision or near miss with an electric car.</p>
      <p>In a bid to make them safer, a new EU requires all newly made electric and hybrid vehicles to have an audio signal system, which must be fitted to all pre-existing models by July 2021.</p>
      <p>Vision Express’ Dan McGhee said there could be nine million of these vehicles on the UK’s roads by 2030 and that 85 per cent of adults say they have problems with their vision.</p>
      <p>As part of its campaign the company is encouraging people who have been putting off eye tests to get one sooner rather than later.</p>
