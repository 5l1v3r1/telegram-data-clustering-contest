        <b>ORIGINAL: 11 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>RCMP are looking for information after a 13-year-old boy was hit and left by a car in downtown Kamloops.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at the intersection of Seymour Street and Eighth Avenue at 2 p.m. Tuesday. The teen was crossing Seymour Street in the crosswalk.</p>
      <p>The boy was taken to a medical facility with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>The vehicle that hit him didn't stop at the scene.</p>
      <p>Instead, the black Buick Encore continued down Seymour. It may have damage to the front left quarter panel, police say.</p>
      <p>Any tips about the driver or suspect vehicle can be called in to police at 250-828-3000 or CrimeStoppers at 1-800-222-8477. </p>
