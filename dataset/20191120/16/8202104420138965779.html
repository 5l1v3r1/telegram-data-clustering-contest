      <h3>Let’s just get rid of the flag poles. And, sooner would be better than later, before there is another new department with numerous new people hired at city hall to deal with the issue of which flag is deemed suitable and which is not.</h3>
      <p>There are more serious issues to be dealt with by our city than flags.</p>
