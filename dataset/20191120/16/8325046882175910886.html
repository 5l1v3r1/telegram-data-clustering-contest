      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/lizzie-mcguire">“Lizzie McGuire”</a> is getting a reboot 15 years after the <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/disney-channel">Disney Channel</a> original series premiered.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/hilary-duff">Hilary Duff</a> delighted fans when she appeared at Disney’s D23 Expo in Anaheim, California in August and revealed that she would be reprising her beloved role as the Lizzie McGuire for a reboot that will be available on <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>. The streaming service launched on Tuesday, November 12 in the US, Canada, and the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>News of the reboot was exciting for people who grew up watching Duff portray a 13-year-old navigating middle school with best friends Miranda (played by Lalaine) and Gordo (Adam Lamberg). “Lizzie McGuire” ran from 2001 to 2004, lasting two seasons. It also led to a 2003 movie, which showed a recently graduated Lizzie going on a school trip to Rome.</p>
      <p>As more information is revealed, here’s everything we know about the upcoming “Lizzie McGuire” revival so far.</p>
      <h3>Lizzie will be 30 years old and living in New York City</h3>

      <p>“Her life is framed pretty perfectly,” Duff told ABC’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMNKcInjGrI">“Good Morning America.”</a> “She has her dream job [as] an apprentice to an interior designer who is a pretty big deal. She has a gorgeous fiancé who is this chef at this cool Soho restaurant. She has a cute little apartment in Brooklyn and everything is going her way and she’s celebrating her 30th birthday with all of her friends.”</p>
      <h3>The first episode will end with a twist</h3>

      <p>Duff told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMNKcInjGrI">“GMA”</a> that Lizzie “gets some pretty big news at the end of the episode.” It’s unclear if the shocker will be related to her career or her personal life. It might even be connected to both.</p>
      <p>The actress also told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-MDZLNUwRw">Entertainment Weekly and PeopleTV</a> that Lizzie will be an apprentice “at the start of the show,” which alludes to the possibility of a change in the character’s job at some point on the series.</p>
      <h3>The show won’t explain how Lizzie ended up in NYC</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>In the 2003 movie, Lizzie explored Italy and discovered a pop star named Isabella who had an uncanny resemblance to her. Lizzie and Isabella sang “What Dreams are Made of” in front of a huge audience, Lizzie and Gordo finally kissed, and they presumably went back home to their regular lives.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the reboot won’t address the steps that led Lizzie to the bustling city.</p>
      <p>Duff also told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-MDZLNUwRw">Entertainment Weekly and People TV</a> that Lizzie “probably isn’t going to stay there for very long.”</p>
      <p>The actress elaborated during an interview with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/interview-hilary-duff-younger-finale-lizzie-mcguire.html">Vulture</a>, saying that Lizzie will “be coming back to Los Angeles. She’s forced out of New York. She’s like, ‘I can’t be here anymore.'”</p>
      <h3>Animated Lizzie will return wearing the exact same outfit from the original series</h3>

      <p>“She’s the heart of it and the sass of it all,” Duff told <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1165057292707852288">Variety</a> of her witty cartoon alter ego. The actress also said that she’s “obsessed” with the iconic outfit, which features a pink crop top and orange platform flip flops.</p>
      <p>Duff also told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-MDZLNUwRw">Entertainment Weekly and PeopleTV</a> that animated Lizzie is her “favorite element of the show because I feel like I still have my 13-year-old self telling me I’m not cool or speaking the truth when it can’t be spoken.”</p>
      <h3>Some familiar faces will show up</h3>

      <p>In October, Disney revealed that Hallie Todd (Jo McGuire), Robert Carradine (Sam McGuire), and Jake Thomas (Matt McGuire) will <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1187474965420863489">reprise their roles</a> as Lizzie’s family members.</p>
      <p>Duff previously implied that some characters will return during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMNKcInjGrI">“GMA.”</a></p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of surprises in store and I think everyone’s dreams are going to be fulfilled by going on the journey of the show,” she said.</p>
      <p>In November, it was revealed that Lamberg is returning as Gordo.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“Gordo was an essential piece of the puzzle to what made the original ‘Lizzie McGuire’ so authentic and beloved,” Duff said in a press release. “I couldn’t imagine the series without him. I can’t wait for fans to see what he’s up to 15 years later and how he fits into Lizzie’s adult world.”</p>
      <p>Duff also alluded to the return of Ethan Craft (played by Clayton Snyder) during <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1090743/hilary-duff-s-latest-scoop-about-lizzie-mcguire-revival-will-have-fans-freaking-out">an interview with “E! News.”</a></p>
      <h3>There’s no release date for the series yet</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>In August 2019, Duff told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-MDZLNUwRw">EW and PeopleTV</a> that they hadn’t started filming the show yet. So it’s likely that the reboot won’t be available until sometime in 2020. The amount of episodes is also unclear.</p>
