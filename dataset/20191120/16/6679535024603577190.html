      <p>MADURAI</p>
      <p>The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday disposed of a public interest litigation petition that challenged the government order passed by the School Education department to conduct public examination for class V and VIII.</p>
      <p>The petitioner, V. Rajendran of Pattukottai, a retired teacher, said that the introduction of public examination for class V and VIII would cause unnecessary burden on students. He said that experts should have been consulted before passing the G.O.</p>
      <p>A Division Bench of Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and R. Tharani observed that the petitioner had only relied on newspaper reports. He should carry out an independent research and establish due credentials. Disposing of the petition, the court said that the petitioner was at liberty to carry out a research and submit a representation to the State in this regard.</p>
