      <h1>Humans Place in Suspended Animation for First Time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Humans have been placed in suspended animation for the first time, in a technique called emergency preservation and resuscitation (EPR).</p>
      <blockquote>EPR involves rapidly cooling a person to around 10 to 15°C by replacing all of their blood with ice-cold saline. The patient’s brain activity almost completely stops. They are then disconnected from the cooling system and their body – which would otherwise be classified as dead – is moved to the operating theatre.<br/><br/>A surgical team then has 2 hours to fix the person’s injuries before they are warmed up and their heart restarted. Tisherman says he hopes to be able to announce the full results of the trial by the end of 2020.</blockquote>
      <p>Years ago I remember reading in <i>Popular Science</i> of experiments like this involving dogs. It’s amazing that it’s moving to the human stage.</p>
