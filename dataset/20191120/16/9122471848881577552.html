      <h1>This Stat Doesn’t Bode Well For Penn State’s Chances Against Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:52:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State-Penn State is the highlight of the Week 13 schedule in college football. The winner will wrap up the Big Ten East and be the favorite in next month’s conference championship game.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact both teams are ranked in the top 10 and the last three matchups between them have been decided by a total of five points, Vegas thinks this game will be a blowout. Ohio State is favored by three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>This morning, ESPN’s Chris Fallica shared a stat he unearthed that should make Penn State fans uneasy. In the last 40 years, there have been only seven other top 10 matchups with a point spread this large.</p>
      <p>Not only has the underdog never won, but they often don’t even cover the spread. The favored team is 5-2 ATS in these situations.</p>

      <p>Of course they play these games on the field, not on paper or on a computer, so Penn State could always buck this trend.</p>
      <p>Still, this statistic is just the latest sign that the Nittany Lions have their work cut out for them in Columbus on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Ohio State-Penn State will kick off at noon ET Saturday on FOX. The Buckeyes have won six of their last seven against PSU.</p>
