      <h1>Islanders urged to support Putting Children First pledge</h1>
      <h2>ISLANDERS, businesses, public sector employees and other organisations are being asked to support a new pledge being launched by the government today to commit to putting children first.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:36:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Stephenson</a></address>
      <p>A website has gone live today – on World Children’s Day – which Islanders can use to electronically sign the pledge.</p>
      <p>Today is also the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which will be indirectly incorporated into Jersey law under proposals being considered by ministers.</p>
      <p>A consultation on plans to introduce a legal duty for States Members and other public authorities to consider children’s rights as part of their functions has also started today and will run for 12 weeks, closing on 11 February.</p>
      <p>The launch of the campaign comes a year after politicians were asked to sign their own pledge to put children first. However, at the time a number of Members raised concerns that they were being ‘railroaded’ into supporting policy measures that backbenchers had no influence over.</p>
      <p>A number of Members said they felt unable to commit to such promises without having the authority to deliver change and some declined to sign it altogether.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister John Le Fondré said: ‘The Council of Ministers has recognised the importance of prioritising children and young people and has committed to “Putting Children First” in the Government Plan, Common Strategic Policy and Children and Young People’s Plan. The government is committed to learning lessons from the past and to improving outcomes for our children and young people, both now and in the future. I am delighted to see the launch of this campaign and would encourage Islanders to add their support to the Pledge to Put Children First.’</p>
      <p>The Islanders’ pledge will be used to give weight to government policies which support children and young people, with the campaign set to act as a reminder of what politicians have signed up to and so Islanders can hold them to account.</p>
      <p>All government employees were today due to be asked to support the pledge, while the Chamber of Commerce was due to ask its members. Schools were also being sent campaign pack.</p>
      <p>Mark Rogers, director general of the Children, Young People, Education and Skills department, added: ‘Today is a day to listen to children, celebrate their rights and take action to support a better future for every child. We want every child and young person to be able to learn and achieve, grow up safely and healthy, and be valued and involved.</p>
      <p>Islanders wishing to support the campaign can do so via the gov.je website.</p>
