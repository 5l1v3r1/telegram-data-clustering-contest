      <h1>Chewing gums may lower risk of dental cavities: Study</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:41:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Chewing sugar-free gum may help reduce the deterioration of cavities of the teeth, according to a study that analyzed research published over the last 50 years on dental caries.</p>
      <p>The review, published in the Journal of Dental Research: Clinical &amp; Translational Research, revealed that sugar-free gum could reduce the advancement of dental caries, and may be used as a viable preventative agent, compared to non-chewing control strategies like oral health education and supervising toothbrushing programs.</p>
      <p>The researchers, including those from King's College London in the UK, analyzed 12 studies published in the past 50 years that explored the impact and intervention outcome of chewing sugar-free gum on oral health conditions.</p>
      <p>The study noted that sugar-free gum reduced the risk of deterioration of dental cavities by 28 percent.</p>
      <p>"There is a considerable degree of variability in the effect from the published data and the trials included were generally of moderate quality," said study lead author Avijit Banerjee from King's College London.</p>
      <p>However, the researchers said there was a need to update and refresh existing knowledge about sugar-free gum and its effect on oral health.</p>
      <p>"We are planning further research to determine the acceptability and feasibility of using this method in public health," Banerjee said.</p>
      <p>The study said that chewing sugar-free gum has recently emerged as a possible supplement to existing prevention strategies in stopping the development of dental caries.</p>
      <p>"Both the stimulation of saliva which can act as a natural barrier to protect teeth, and the mechanical plaque control that results from the act of chewing, can contribute to the prevention of dental caries," Banerjee added.</p>
      <p>He said sugar-free gum can also act as a carrier for antibacterial ingredients such as xylitol and sorbitol.</p>
      <p>"No recent conclusive evidence existed prior to this review that showed the relationship between slowing the development of caries and chewing sugar-free gum," Banerjee said.</p>
