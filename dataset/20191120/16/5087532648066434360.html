      <h1>Spotify Free Tier Coming to Alexa, Sonos, And Bose Devices</h1>

      <p>Spotify’s free tier is coming to Alexa powered devices. It will also work on Sonos and Bose devices, <i>Techcrunch</i> reported. Previously only those with a premium subscription could access their music on such speakers.</p>
      <blockquote>In the case of Alexa devices, like Amazon Echo speakers or the Fire TV, users will be able to ask Alexa to play Spotify’s playlist, like “Today’s Top Hits,” or their personalized playlist, “Discover Weekly,” among others. The service can also be set as the default, so you can use commands like “Play my Discover Weekly,” “Like this song,” or “Pause,” and more, without having to say “on Spotify.” Meanwhile, on Sonos and Bose speakers, users can set up Spotify Connect from the Spotify app. This works with Bose smart speakers and soundbars, as well as all Sonos smart speakers, including the new indoor/outdoor speaker Sonos Move and the Symfonisk IKEA WiFi Speaker, integrated with the Sonos Home Sound System.</blockquote>
