      <p>Essel Group has announced plans to sell 16.5% stake in ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. (ZEEL) to financial investors towards repayment of loans to certain lenders. The shares are currently encumbered and these lenders had consented to such share sale by the group.</p>
      <p>“Out of the aforesaid, the group seeks to sell 2.3% stake in ZEEL to OFI Global China Fund, LLC and/or its affiliates,” Essel Group said in a statement. “The post-transaction overall holdings of the group in ZEEL will be 5%, out of which encumbered holdings of the group will reduce to 1.1% of ZEEL,” the statement added.</p>
      <p>“This development reaffirms the group’s positive progress on its overall asset divestment approach, undertaken to generate adequate liquidity for the repayment process,” Essel Group said.</p>
      <p>The group is also working actively on further divestments, including its media and non-media assets, and remains confident to complete the same, it said.</p>
