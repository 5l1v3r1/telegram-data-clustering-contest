      <p>The money was raised by the 118 walkers, who took part in the annual snowpaedic challenge, which is organised by The Orthopaedic Institute, a charity based at The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital (RJAH) in Oswestry.</p>
      <p>A £1.5 million appeal was launched by the hospital towards the end of last year to fund the new Veterans’ Orthopaedic Centre, which will allow veterans to be treated in a bespoke environment suited to their needs.</p>
      <p>The centre will support the expansion of the current veterans’ orthopaedic service, which is led by consultant orthopaedic surgeon and army surgeon, Lieutenant Colonel Carl Meyer, at RJAH.</p>
      <p>This year, the annual walk was raising funds towards the Veterans’ Centre Research and Education Fund.</p>
      <p>This will allow continued research into lower limb conditions and provide teaching for new staff within the planned centre.</p>
      <p>Debra Alexander, fundraiser for the Orthopaedic Institute, said: “The snowpaedic challenge is always a really fantastic event and this year’s was no exception. We were blessed with a glorious warm September day and everyone who took part really enjoyed themselves.</p>
      <p>“Many of our walkers were regulars who had taken part in the event before. However we were also pleased to have lots of new faces join us this year.</p>
      <p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to say that this year’s snowpaedic challenge has raised in excess of £7,000 – that’s thanks to the efforts of our wonderful walkers but also from the fantastic team at Lanyon Bowdler Solicitors in Shrewsbury, who raised an amazing £1,300 in total.</p>
      <p>“The money raised from the event will go towards supporting research into veterans’ medicine and provide teaching for our veterans’ orthopaedic service team.</p>
      <p>“I would like to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to everyone who joined us for this year’s event and for their continued support.”</p>
