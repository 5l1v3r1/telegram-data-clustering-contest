      <p>Now that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/alcest/">Alcest</a>’s superb new album <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-alcest-spiritual-instinct/">Spiritual Instinct</a> has been out for a bit, it’s time to meet the man behind the music. As a quiet, enigmatic soul, Neige is not the sort of chap it’s particularly easy to get close to, lovely as he is. So, in order to find out a little more about him, we put 13 incredibly searching questions to him… Although he still didn’t give much away.</p>

      <p><b>When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?<br/></b>“I wanted to draw, do illustration. I almost pursued it – I had to choose between music and art school. I chose music.”</p>
