      <h1>Report: Clippers’ Leonard, George to play first game together vs. Celtics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/teams/los-angeles-clippers/">Los Angeles Clippers</a>‘ <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/kawhi-leonard/512591">Kawhi Leonard</a> is expected to make his return to the court tonight against the Boston Celtics, according to ESPN’s Ohm Youngmisuk.</p>
      <p>Leonard has missed the team’s last three games with a left knee contusion.</p>

      <p>This will be the first time the duo of Leonard and fellow Clippers star <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/players/paul-george/469218">Paul George</a> share the floor this season, as George missed the first 11 games recovering from dual shoulder surgeries.</p>
      <p>The Clippers pulled off a league-altering off-season of acquisitions last summer, assuring the arrival of Leonard in free agency by trading for George in a sizeable deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, effectively forming a title contender overnight.</p>
      <p>George has averaged 29.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists on 56.3-per cent shooting over three games, while Leonard has posted 26.8 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 6.0 assists on 44-per cent shooting over nine games.</p>
