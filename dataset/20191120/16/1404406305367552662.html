      <p>In this flashback, BG Knocc Out addressed calling out Kodak Black for his comments about Lauren London following Nipsey Hussle's death. BG explained that he listens to Kodak's music and doesn't have anything against him, which led to a conversation about Kodak being reckless. BG stated that he doesn't think Kodak has a strong team around him, and he added that he thinks Kodak believes the money won't stop with his career and that he'll stay hot despite being out of the public eye. The conversation led to Gucci Mane cleaning up his life and image after marrying Keyshia Ka'Oir, which you can hear more of above.</p>
