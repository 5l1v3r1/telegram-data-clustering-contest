      <p>Hereford has been named the UK city with the highest number of drink and drug driving rates for the second year running.</p>
      <p>Analysis of over six million car insurance quotes found that there are 1.8 drink and drug driving convictions for every 1,000 drivers in the cathedral city.</p>
      <p>Darlington comes in second place at 1.69, followed by Llandudno in Wales (1.64), Liverpool (1.64) and Blackpool (1.56).</p>
      <p>At the other end of the scale is North West London (0.42), Galashiels (0.50), Perth (0.58) and Enfield (0.62).</p>
      <p>Plumbers were the most likely to have been caught drinking or taking drugs and driving, with 10.7 convictions per 1,000 drivers.</p>

      <p>Men were more than twice as likely as women to be convicted, with a rate of 1.36 compared to 0.56.</p>
      <p>When it comes to age, drivers between the age of 20 and 24 (2.30) are the most likely to be convicted, while drivers over the age of 65 (0.12) are the least likely.</p>
      <p>The data also showed that drink related offences continue to decline year-on-year, from 1.52 per 1,000 drivers in 2017, to 1.03 in 2018, to 0.87 this year.</p>

      <p>However, drug driving offences continue to increase – from 0.06 per 1,000 drivers in 2017, to 0.11 in 2018, to 0.14 in 2019.</p>
      <p>The analysis was done on car insurance quotes run on MoneySuperMarket over the last 12 months, up to the end of October.</p>
      <p>Rachel Wait, consumer affairs spokesperson, commented: ‘It’s good to see that the overall convictions for drink and drug driving are dropping. This could be a result of increased awareness about the effects of excessive drinking and a greater general focus on health and fitness.</p>
      <p>‘That being said, the Christmas party season is just around the corner and with that comes an increased chance of people driving while over the limit – often without realising. It’s not always easy to know when you’ve stepped over the legal threshold. Our research reveals that nearly one in five people know they have driven a car when over the limit, either on purpose or by accident – for example, the morning after a night out.</p>
      <p>‘To avoid any uncertainty, if you think you’re over the limit, don’t take the chance. Not only are you putting yourself and others at risk, a drink or drug driving conviction can result in a long time off the road and sky-high car insurance premiums.’</p>
