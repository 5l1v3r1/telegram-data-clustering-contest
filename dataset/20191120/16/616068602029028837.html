      <p>The City of Penticton is putting up $30,000 to provide subsidized housing for locum doctors filling in at the hospital.</p>
      <p>City councillors heard a presentation Tuesday from Dr. Brian Forzley and Dr. David Stoll, members of the Medical Staff Association at PRH.</p>
      <p>The pair said housing has become one of the largest barriers to attracting physicians, particularly locums, who travel to fill in for doctors on leave for periods of a few weeks to a month.</p>
      <p>Recruiting locums is usually the first step to bringing the doctors to the community on a permanent basis, said Dr. Stoll.</p>
      <p>“It’s unusual to get a physician to come to a community without them actually be able to check out the site, work a little bit in the department, test the waters.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Forzley noted Penticton is competing against other Interior Health hospitals for doctors. He used an example of a locum anesthetist last summer who tried to come to Penticton with her husband and three children but could not find a rental below $3,000 a month.</p>
      <p>Instead, she took a position in Kamloops, which offers free housing for locums and doctors moving to the community. </p>
      <p>Council heard Penticton is currently short seven psychologists and the average age of doctors in the hospital is over 50.</p>
      <p>The District of Summerland and Regional District of Okanagan Similkameen will both be approached for $5,000. The combined $40,000 will act as seed funding to secure three units of housing for locum doctors — one for a family and two smaller. Rent would still be collected, but the municipal funds will act as a subsidy for 3-5 years. </p>
      <p>Council voted 5-2 to accept the doctor’s proposal and take the funds out of this year’s budget.</p>
      <p>The Town's of Oliver and Osoyoos put forward money earlier this year for a similar initiative at South Okanagan General Hospital. </p>
