      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tyler-Lockett/?tps=1">Tyler Lockett</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mike_Evans/?tps=1">Mike Evans</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Calvin-Ridley/?tps=1">Calvin Ridley</a>, D.J. Chark and Kenny Golladay round out my top 10 options for Week 12.</p>
      <p>If you don't have an elite wide receiver, there are plenty of capable pass catchers with great Week 12 matchups. Be sure to check out my <a href="https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2019/11/19/Fantasy-football-Week-12-best-adddrops-from-waiver-wire/3221574175714/">weekly waiver wire article</a> if you are in need of a new player at the position.</p>
      <p>You should target players who have a good chance to score a touchdown and get a lot of looks from their respective quarterbacks, when considering who to start at wide receiver.</p>
      <p>You should remove <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Arizona-Cardinals/?tps=1">Arizona Cardinals</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kansas-City-Chiefs/?tps=1">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, Los Angeles Chargers and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Minnesota-Vikings/?tps=1">Minnesota Vikings</a> players from your lineup, as those teams have Week 12 byes.</p>
      <p>Here are some of my favorite players in this week's rankings:</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOP SHELF</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cleveland-Browns/?tps=1">Cleveland Browns</a> wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is not having a great season in 2019 after having monster expectations entering his first campaign with the team. Beckham has just one score and has only surpassed 100 receiving yards once this season. I'm expecting a breakout game in Week 12 when the Browns face the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Miami-Dolphins/?tps=1">Miami Dolphins</a> Sunday in Cleveland. The Dolphins are tied for allowing the second-most receiving touch downs to wide receivers this season. I'm expecting at least 100 yards and a touchdown from Beckham in this matchup. He should break loose for several big plays against this beatable secondary.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Atlanta-Falcons/?tps=1">Atlanta Falcons</a> wide receiver Julio Jones is my No. 3 option this week. Jones has 882 yards and four scores on 59 receptions in his 10 starts this season. He should light up a <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tampa-Bay-Buccaneers/?tps=1">Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a> secondary allowing the most fantasy points per game, receiving yards and touchdowns to wide receivers. I'm expecting at least 100 receiving yards and a score from Jones in this NFC South clash.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SNEAKY PLAYS</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Seattle-Seahawks/?tps=1">Seattle Seahawks</a> rookie D.K. Metcalf was a freak of nature at the NFL Combine, but watched his stock plummet during the 2019 NFL Draft. Now he is showing the doubters that he deserved to be a first round pick. Metcalf has three touchdowns in his last three games. He had a season-high 123 yards and a score on six catches in Week 9. I'm expecting MVP candidate <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Russell_Wilson/?tps=1">Russell Wilson</a> to hook up with Metcalf with regularity when the Seahawks face the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Philadelphia-Eagles/?tps=1">Philadelphia Eagles</a> in Week 12. The Eagles have been one of the worst secondaries in the NFL this season and are allowing the fourth-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Metcalf has a shot at a score and/or 100 receiving yards in this matchup. He comes in at No. 14 in my weekly rankings, landing in low-end WR1/high-end WR2 territory, depending on your league's size.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oakland-Raiders/?tps=1">Oakland Raiders</a> wide receiver <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tyrell-Williams/?tps=1">Tyrell Williams</a> has capitalized off of a rebound season from quarterback <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Derek-Carr/?tps=1">Derek Carr</a> in 2019. Williams is up to 462 yards and five scores this season and is averaging 15.4 yards per catch. He lands at No. 15 in my weekly rankings as a high-end WR2. He should have plenty of success this week against against a <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Jets/?tps=1">New York Jets</a> secondary allowing the third-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Williams should be started in all leagues in Week 12.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LONGSHOTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>New York Jets wide receiver <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jamison-Crowder/?tps=1">Jamison Crowder</a> lands at No. 17 in my weekly rankings. Crowder is scolding hot, with a touchdown in each of his last three games. This week he battles an Oakland Raiders unit allowing the seventh-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. He should post WR2 numbers in Week 12.</p>
      <p>James Washington has a great opportunity to succeed in Week 12 as <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pittsburgh_Steelers/?tps=1">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> star wide receiver <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/JuJu-Smith-Schuster/?tps=1">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> deals with a concussion and knee injury. Washington lands at No. 26 in my weekly rankings, based on the assumption that Smith-Schuster misses the team's AFC North matchup against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cincinnati-Bengals/?tps=1">Cincinnati Bengals</a>. The Bengals have been decent at defending wide receivers this year, but Washington should be peppered with targets and have solid production. He makes a great bye week fill in option for Week 12 if your normal starter is out.</p>
