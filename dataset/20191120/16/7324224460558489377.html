      <p>A farm in Maidenhead has been spotted using alpacas to protect its turkeys from predators including foxes ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>The free-range turkeys are guarded at the Copas Traditional Turkeys farm in Cookham near Maidenhead as they wander their habitat.</p>
      <p>According to the turkey farm, it has a herd of 10 alpacas which guard the turkeys against predators.</p>
      <p>The farm said: “We now have 10 beautiful boys at our farm and are on the lookout for more friends to join them.”</p>

      <p>According to the BBC, Tom Copas, the owner of the family business, came up with the idea in 2015 after a series of fox attacks resulted in hundreds of birds being killed at the farm.</p>
      <p>The family farm has been in the turkey business since 1957.</p>
