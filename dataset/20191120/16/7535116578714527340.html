      <h1>This South Korean Taskforce Watches Online Porn All Day, But Not Because They Enjoy It</h1>

      <p>It‚Äôs an open secret that there is porn out there on the internet, and while porn may not necessarily be bad, there are certain types of porn that are simply criminal and inhumane. Stuff like child pornography, spycam and revenge porn is just plain wrong, but unfortunately, it still gets posted on the internet ‚Äì with usually no repercussions to the criminals. While you may think that there‚Äôs no way of regulating these videos from being posted, the South Korean government has come up with an excellent solution.</p>
      <p>There‚Äôs a 16-member digital sex unit crime monitoring unit that was formed by the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC) whose main job every day is to watch online porn. If you think it‚Äôs for something lewd, their job is actually the opposite of that! This task force is focused on spycam videos taken by perverted men to spy on women in toilets, fitting rooms, schools, etc. This task force amazingly operates 24 hours a day.</p>

      <p>Besides spycam or ‚Äúmolka‚Äù videos, they also focus on removing ‚Äúrevenge porn‚Äù, which is posted by jealous <s><i>and STUPID</i></s> ex-boyfriends or once again, perverts, after their girlfriends break up with them.</p>
      <p>That said, viewing this content daily is not a cushy job as it takes a toll on the mental health of the team members. One of the members said that he couldn‚Äôt look at women the same way again after work and had to keep his eyes down. Another recounted how shocked he was on his very first day at work.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>‚ÄúI saw many provocative pictures of a kind that I had never seen before in my life.‚Äù</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This material is found through Twitter and YouTube, where they search for the relevant hashtags in the Korean language. If they find a suspected video, they can order the site to take it down, but unfortunately, most of the sites are hosted by overseas servers and the most they can do is to <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2019/11/20/south-korean-regulators-watch-porn-all-day---to-find-illicit-spycam-videos">ask domestic Internet services to block access to these sites</a>. One of the best things they do however, is having a hotline where victims can call them straight to make a report.</p>

      <p>In South Korea, filming or distributing videos without consent can get a person up to 5 years of jail, but sadly, the most these people are getting is a fine. <i>Hmmmmm, sounds familiar?</i> According to the secretary-general of KCSC, some people found this monitoring to be ‚Äúinfringement of freedom‚Äù, but he had a short yet stern response to these low-lives.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>‚ÄúWhen I listen to such claims, I want to ask them this: Would you say the same thing if it was your wife or daughters?‚Äù</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Kudos to the South Korean government for forming this task force which is so, so important for the safety of internet users and women in general nowadays. My next question is, Malaysia when?</i>
