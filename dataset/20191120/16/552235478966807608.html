      <h1>The reasons Daniel Stendel has Hearts fans excited at the prospect of him taking over at Tynecastle</h1>
      <h2>An approach has reportedly been made to the 45-year-old and supporters seem especially keen on the idea.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Daniel Stendel’s name was the one generating the most excitement among Hearts fans as their hunt for a new boss continues.</p>
      <p>In fact, it was arguably the only name that seemed to capture imaginations, especially after the first phase of candidates to be interviewed became public.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> has now moved on to managers either in work or still being paid by clubs they have only recently left. More interviews are understood to have taken place this week, although it appears the club are being more circumspect in their dealings this time around</p>
      <p>Stendel has reportedly been approached, but Hearts would face some difficulties should they wish to take their interest further.</p>
      <p>He left Barnsley at the start of October after a run of 10 Championship games without a win. However, rather than simply having his contract paid up, Stendel is effectively on gardening leave until the end of this season, and would need to reach a financial agreement with the Tykes in order to take a job elsewhere before then.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> would also have to agree to pay compensation, although Budge confirmed after Craig Levein’s departure that won't be an issue in itself should it be required for any candidate. The sticking point is more likely to be whether Stendel can come to an arrangement with Barnsley, and how long that is likely to take.</p>
      <p>But aside from the fact that Stendel, who grew up speaking Russian not far from the Polish border, is not one of the usual suspects that often get touted for managerial jobs north of the border, why do Jambos seem so keen on the German?</p>
      <p>First and foremost, supporters demand on pitch success and Stendel can point to that on his CV. After taking charge of Hannover 96’s youth teams in his native Germany, he was appointed first team coach on a temporary basis at the end of the 2015-16 Bundesliga season.</p>
      <p>Hannover were relegated, but with only six games remaining when Stendel took over, it was how they responded to going down that was important.</p>

      <p>They responded well, finishing second in the table and securing promotion back to the German top flight at the first time of asking.</p>
      <p>However, Stendel was surprisingly sacked in March of that season, even though he’d laid the foundations for a successful campaign.</p>
      <p>He then spent a season out of work before becoming the surprise choice to replace Jose Morais as Barnsley manager in June 2018.</p>
      <p>The Oakwell club had just been relegated from the Championship, but Stendel once again proved adept at reacting well to relegation, leading a young team to automatic promotion ahead of more fancied rivals and in a style that excited supporters.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We've identified that the counter-press has been used by the most successful teams in the world and Daniel is one of the best coaches at doing that,” said former Barnsley CEO Gauthier Ganaye when appointing him.</p>
      <p>"As well as the style, Daniel has the philosophy of using and developing younger players which fits perfectly in our model too."</p>
      <p>On his own playing philosophy, Stendel told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/nov/27/daniel-stendel-barnsley-german-klopp-guardiola">the Guardian</a> : “It doesn’t matter what team we are playing, we play our style, we play forward, active and we want to win the game. I like emotions and I like a lot of team spirit.”</p>
      <p>That team spirit was fostered by organising trips to ninja obstacle courses, go kart tracks and organising table tennis tournaments amongst his squad.</p>
      <p>A lack of investment over the summer frustrated the 45-year-old however, and with Barnsley struggling to make an impact upon their return to the Championship, he left his position, sparking criticism of those running the club.</p>

      <p>The esteem Stendel was held in Barnsley fans was such that they invited him out on a drinking session after he left the club. That Stendel accepted and was pictured downing shots with them only further endeared him.</p>
      <p>The feeling was mutual as well, with Stendel never slow to to acknowledge and talk up the pride his fans had in their club and their town.</p>
      <p>While it remains to be seen how feasible an option Stendel ultimately is for the job at Tynecastle, a look at his previous methods and relationships show why he’d be a popular choice at this stage for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> side.</p>
