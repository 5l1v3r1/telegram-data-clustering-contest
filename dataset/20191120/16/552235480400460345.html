      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:08:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>A Tory MSP has called on South Lanarkshire Council to “up its game” in filling empty homes.</p>
      <p>The authority was mentioned throughout a hard-hitting report on the issue by a committee of MSPs and Graham Simpson – who sits on it – has slammed SLC for being one of the few councils not to employ an empty homes officer.</p>
      <p>Recent figures revealed that the number of empty properties in South Lanarkshire has increased from 2656 in 2007 to 3243 in 2017 – a 22 per cent increase. The stats also showed properties empty for six months or more here had increased from 963 in 2007 to 1174 in 2018.</p>
      <p>Central Scotland MSP Mr Simpson said: “SLC is one of the few councils not to employ an empty homes officer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Evidence shows these officers are highly effective in bringing empty homes back into use.</p>
      <p>“The council was criticised by some residents for its heavy-handed approach to using the empty homes levy – without even checking if work is being done on houses to bring them back into use. This is actually making matters worse.”</p>
      <p>The Local Government and Communities Committee called it “unacceptable” that the council tax levy is being over-used by some councils.</p>
      <p>It allows for local authorities to remove the discount on empty properties and charge a council tax increase of up to 100 per cent.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The report says in some cases, the levy is being used as a revenue raising tool, exacerbating the empty homes problem rather than solving it.</p>
      <p>It also called on the Scottish Government to fulfil its commitment and introduce compulsory sales orders to tackle the blight of empty homes.</p>
      <p>Daniel Lowe, executive director of housing and technical resources for the council, said: “We actively seek to identify empty homes across South Lanarkshire, and works in conjunction with owners to bring them back into use.</p>
      <p>“While we do not currently have a dedicated officer with responsibility for empty homes, a broad range of services are available to engage with owners and offer advice and assistance to them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We have already been working with the Scottish Empty Homes Partnership to review the services it provides, with the aim of increasing the number of long-term empty homes brought back into use.</p>
      <p>“This includes the potential establishment of a dedicated empty homes officer position.”</p>
