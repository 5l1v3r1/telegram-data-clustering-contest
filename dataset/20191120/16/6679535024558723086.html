      <h1>Scrap updated NRC, Assam government urges Centre</h1>
      <h2>Monitored by SC, it was published on August 31</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:45:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Vijaita-Singh-684/" target="_blank">Vijaita Singh</a></address>
      <p>Following Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement in the Rajya Sabha that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise would be conducted across India and repeated in Assam, the State’s Finance Minister, Himanta Biswa Sarma, said Assam had asked the Centre to reject the updated final NRC in the State.</p>
      <p>The final NRC, monitored by the Supreme Court, was published on August 31. More than 19 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants were left out of the register that took five years to compile and cost the exchequer ₹1,220 crore.</p>
      <p>The NRC in Assam was a culmination of the Assam Accord signed in 1985 after a six-year agitation, spearheaded by the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) for detection, disenfranchisement and deportation of foreigners.</p>
      <h3>‘It will be catastrophic’</h3>
      <p>According to human rights activist Harsh Mander, the NRC exercise, if conducted across the country, would be catastrophic for the social fabric and future of India as a secular, democratic republic. “I just returned from Assam and met families excluded from NRC. The enormous human suffering that this has entailed is hard to describe. If it is now imposed in the country after the Citizenship Amendment Bill, it means that only our Muslim brothers and sisters will have to prove their citizenship based on documents that most of us will not be able to produce as it is decades old. This is truly the destruction of the country based on the idea of equal citizenship,” he said.</p>

      <p>The Citizenship Amendment Bill that seeks to grant citizenship to undocumented non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan is likely to be taken up in the ongoing winter session of Parliament.</p>
      <h3>Common cut-off date</h3>
      <p>A senior government official said that before the NRC exercise is conducted, the government will have to decide a common cut-off date. Under Article 6 of the Constitution, the cut-off date for migration to India from Pakistan is July 19, 1948 whereas in Assam, that borders Bangladesh, it is March 24, 1971.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sarma told a press conference in Guwahati that the the 1971 cut-off date should be applicable to all States.</p>
      <p>Assam-based lawyer Aman Wadud, who is providing legal help to those excluded from the NRC, said ideally there should not be any problem with a national register of citizens to issue identity cards. “But the government is using NRC to target a particular community, exclude them from citizenship and deny them all rights. What is more outrageous is that they want to reject NRC in Assam because it does not suit their purpose. This is brazen hypocrisy.”</p>
      <p>An official said laws existed to “detect, detain and deport illegal immigrants”, and the power to identify and deport the foreign nationals staying illegally had been delegated to the States.</p>
