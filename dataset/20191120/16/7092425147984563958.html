        <b>Troy Parrott's form has not gone unnoticed and it'll be interesting to see if he gets any first-team involvement under new Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The talented 17-year-old made his senior debut against Colchester United in the Carabao Cup earlier on this season while he's also featured on the bench in a number of Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Parrott's international form should help his cause as he made his senior debut in the 3-1 win over New Zealand before a tidy finish in the Ireland Under-21s' <a href="https://cms.buzz.ie/sport/stephen-kenny-hails-incredible-second-half-performance-ireland-u21s-343731"><i>4-1 victory over Sweden</i></a> last night.</p>
      <p>Mourinho may even have some competition to hold on to Parrott.</p>

      <p>German giants Bayern Munich are "monitoring his situation having noted his continual progress this season" according to a report in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703739/Bayern-Munich-prepare-shock-Tottenham-striker-Troy-Parrott-eye-Dean-Henderson-swoop.html"><i>Daily Mail</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Bayern's interest in Parrott reportedly stems from their desire to find a young player in the English market who can go on to become a key player, like Jadon Sancho did after joining Borussia Dortmund from Manchester City in 2017.</p>
      <p>The fact that Parrott's deal expires in 2021 has added to Bayern's interest, as they eye a bargain deal.</p>
      <p>Bayern made a number of attempts to sign Callum Hudson-Odoi in the last two windows before he eventually signed a new five-year deal at Stamford Bridge in September.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Bayern are keeping tabs on Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson (currently on loan at Sheffield United) who they see as a potential long-term successor to Manuel Neuer.</p>
