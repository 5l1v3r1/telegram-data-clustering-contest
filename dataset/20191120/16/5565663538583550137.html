      <p>The legal system of Zimbabwe has cleared the <a href="https://bulawayo24.com/index-id-search-keyword-ThisFlag.html">#ThisFlag</a>Â  leader Pastor Evan Mawarire from the crime of subversion that he was facing since the violent protests. <br/><br/>Mawarire was arrested and accused for inciting people to demonstrate and loot during the protests. <br/><br/>Said Mawarire, "After almost 11 months of detention on bail the state has withdrawn their fake treason charges. We should never have been arrested to begin with. Thank you for your prayers and support. We keep speaking up for the abused and vulnerable of our country."<br/><br/>The nationwide protests were triggered by President Emmerson Mnangagwa's move to double fuel prices at the weekend as the country's economic crisis deepens.<br/><br/>A wave of protest erupted in January, prompting a security crackdown in which at least five people were shot dead.</p>
