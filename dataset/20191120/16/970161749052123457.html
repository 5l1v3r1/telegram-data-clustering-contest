      <p>Gearbox has revealed the first campaign add-on for Borderlands 3, featuring Mad Moxxi and a space casino designed by Handsome Jack.</p>
      <p>The first major campaign add-on for Borderlands 3 is called Moxxi’s Heist Of The Handsome Jackpot and it’ll be out on 19 December.</p>
      <p>Whatever else you say about them, the Borderlands games have always been known for their imaginative and generously large DLC packs.</p>
      <p>This new one will involve taking control of a derelict casino space station built by Borderlands 2 bad guy Handsome Jack.</p>
      <p>That seems to mean a mixture of retro enemies and brand-new ones, as well new Legendary weapons and gear, cosmetic items, side missions, and crew challenges.</p>

      <p>The new campaign is meant for characters that are at least level 13, although if you’re much higher than that it’ll scale up to provide a proper challenge and better loot.</p>
      <p>This will be just the first of four planned DLC packs for Borderlands 3 and is included in the season pass and the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition.</p>

      <p>There’s plenty of free content as well though, with the next patch including Takedown At The Maliwan Blacksite (a new raid) and Mayhem 4 (a variation of Mayhem Mode that removes all penalties and has just two random modifiers), alongside other tweaks like an increase in the maximum bank space.</p>
      <p>And finally, Gearbox has announced plans for Mayhem 2.0, which while revamp Mayhem Mode with more modifiers and rewards. Although that sounds like it’s a way off, as more information isn’t due until next year.</p>
      <p>If you’re still on the fence about Borderlands 3 itself then it’s free-to-play for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 between Thursday, 21 November and Sunday, 24 November.</p>
