      <p>A young woman who had a large part of her skull removed after she was knocked down in a hit and run has revealed shocking images of her injuries.</p>
      <p>Steph Blake, from Totton, Hampshire, was left in a coma for 19 days and suffered brain swelling, forcing doctors having to remove a large chunk from the top of her skull.</p>
      <p>Her injuries also meant she was unable to take up a job offer to become a cabin crew member for EasyJet.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has released the X-ray images and spoken out as part of Road Safety Week to drum home the "massive" consequences of drivers failing to be careful.</p>
      <p>She said: "The past year or so has been the most difficult of my life and the incident has affected me in so many ways.</p>

      <p>"I was devastated that I couldn't take up my cabin crew job and it is difficult not to think about how things could have been different.</p>
      <p>"However, I have to remember that I'm lucky to be alive. I'm determined to look to the future and move forward with my life.</p>
      <p>"Nothing will change what has happened, but I just want to encourage people to always be careful on the road. Failing to do so can have massive consequences," she added.</p>
      <p>Steph, who lives at home with parents Sue and Steve, had waited for a green man before crossing the A35 in Totton on the morning of 22 June, 2018.</p>

      <p>She stepped out onto the road after the lights changed. While one lane of traffic had stopped, Steph was hit by a car in the second lane which had not stopped.</p>
      <p>She said: "I remember the cars had stopped and the lane being empty, then I remember a car at my left hip.</p>
      <p>"I can also remember laying on the ground and think I have memory of people coming to help. After that there is just nothing.</p>
      <p>"The next thing I recall is waking up in hospital and seeing my Dad."</p>

      <p>Steph was taken to Southampton General Hospital and admitted to Wessex Neurological Unit.</p>
      <p>She underwent a six-hour operation to remove part of her skull due to her brain swelling. She was in a coma for 19 days.</p>
      <p>Steph has also undergone two further operations due to her traumatic injuries.</p>
      <p>She has made strong progress since the incident, but still continues to face issues with fatigue, memory loss, concentration and some behavioural issues.</p>

      <p>Following the incident, Steph instructed serious injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to help her access specialist rehabilitation she requires.</p>
      <p>Now, the legal experts have joined with her to mark Brake's annual Road Safety Week.</p>
      <p>Claire Howard, Partner and serious injury expert at Irwin Mitchell's Southampton office, is representing Steph.</p>
      <p>She said: "This case is yet another example of the huge effect that road traffic collisions can have on those involved.</p>

      <p>"Steph has suffered devastating, life-threatening injuries which have impacted greatly on her life.</p>
      <p>"While Steph has undoubtedly made great progress considering everything she has been through, she still continues to experience significant issues related to the injuries.</p>
      <p>"Not only that, but she has also faced the heartbreak of her life changing causing her to miss out on a dream job opportunity."</p>
      <p>Steph's friends raised hundreds of pounds for her which she decided to donate to Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance which was called to the crash scene.</p>
      <p>Claire added: "Road Safety Week is an important time to reflect on what we can all do to ensure road users and pedestrians are always safe from harm.</p>
      <p>"We would urge everyone across our region to use the campaign as an opportunity to consider how they could take extra care and make safety their primary concern."</p>
      <p>Road Safety Week runs from 18-24 November and is organised by Brake.</p>
