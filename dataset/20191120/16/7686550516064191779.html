      <p>A former Swansea Council leader plans to get a new election placard after the one outside his house was pulled out and snapped.</p>
      <p>"It will probably be a bigger one," said Cllr Chris Holley.</p>
      <p>He has CCTV footage of someone ripping out the placard at around 9.10pm on November 19 and plans to report the matter to police.</p>
      <p>The Swansea Liberal Democrat leader said it was the first time it had happened during decades of involvement in local Government politics.</p>
      <p>"It could be anything, but I have my suspicions," he said. "I find it quite alarming."</p>
      <p>Cllr Holley, who is not standing in the general election, was watching Wales beat Hungary in the Euro 2020 decider on television at the time.</p>
      <p>He said his daughter saw the placard was missing the following morning, and found it snapped nearby. Others in the vicinity, he said, hadn't been damaged.</p>
      <p>Cllr Holley, of Middle Road, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/gendros">Gendros</a> , said he felt a "nasty" element had crept into politics for candidates and elected representatives of all parties.</p>
      <p>He said social media trolling and the 2016 Brexit referendum had "soured politics right across the board".</p>

      <p>He said: "You don't get elected to be abused.</p>
      <p>"You can take criticism, and you don't mind a debate. We have all got our different political views.</p>
      <p>"But you don't come into politics to be intimidated. It has got a little bit nasty and there is no need for it."</p>
      <p>Police forces across the UK are taking extra steps to ensure general election candidates are safe from attacks and abuse.</p>
      <p>Candidates have been urged not to go knocking on doors while canvassing alone ahead of December 12 and not to dismiss abuse or threats without reporting them to police.</p>
      <p>Speaking last week, Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: “Strong and varied views are the mark of a healthy democracy, but these should not cross the line into criminal abuse, harassment or disorder."</p>
