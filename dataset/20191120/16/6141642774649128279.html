      <p>Sedgefield was Tony Blair’s constituency for nearly 25 years.</p>
      <p>It used to be one of the safest Labour seats in the country.</p>
      <p>Now it is a Conservative target, which would change hands on a swing of 7.3% – the sort of swing that would deliver Boris Johnson a very comfortable majority in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>He visited the area on Wednesday as part of a tour of Tory targets in north-east England.</p>
      <p>This part of the country could be fertile ground for the Conservatives at the election.</p>
      <p>On a 7.3% swing, four Labour seats would fall to the Tories – including Sedgefield.</p>

      <p>But Labour’s Phil Wilson will not make it easy for them.</p>
      <p>He has held the seat continuously since 2007 and has built up a loyal local following.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he had a majority of 6,059 and won over half (53%) of the vote.</p>
      <p>At this election, he is up against candidates from the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Greens and Brexit Party, plus an Independent.</p>
      <p>With such a variety of opponents, the anti-Labour vote could end up split – and possibly increase the chances of a victory for Mr Wilson.</p>
