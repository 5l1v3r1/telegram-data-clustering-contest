      <p>STAMFORD, Connecticut (WABC) -- Police have arrested a man in the murder of a 93-year-old woman in Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Isabella Mehner's body <a href="https://abc7ny.com/93-year-old-found-at-bottom-of-stairs-was-murdered-ct-police-say/5571527/">was found at the bottom of a staircase</a> leading into the basement of her Cove Road home in Stamford on September 25, and family members initially believe she had fallen down the stairs.</p>
      <p>Now, 51-year-old Robert Simmons is charged with murder, felony murder and home invasion.</p>
      <p>Mehner lived alone, and police said her family became concerned when they couldn't reach her by phone, so they visited the home. When they arrived, they discovered her body.</p>
      <p>The medical examiner determined that the injuries she sustained were not consistent with a fall, and the case was classified as a homicide.</p>
      <p>Authorities say numerous pieces of evidence linked Simmons to the crime, and they do not believe this was a random act of violence as the suspect was familiar with the victim and her home from some previous "odd jobs" for which he had been hired.</p>
      <p>Roy Mehner, the woman's son, called his mother's death "very upsetting."</p>
      <p>"She's 93 years old," he said. "Why would you do something like that? It's just terrible."</p>
      <p>Neighbors were equally shaken, saying Isabella was a "nice human being" who was frequently seen tending to her garden</p>
      <p>"This is a shock," neighbor Christine Klein said. "It's hard."</p>
