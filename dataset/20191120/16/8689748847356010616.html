      <p>The 13th edition of TV3’s Ghana’s Most Beautiful (GMB) contest was shrouded in controversies during the grand finale on November 10 at the Grand Arena of the Accra International Conference Centre.</p>
      <p>After the final declaration of the result, many people expressed utter dismay at the fact that Enam did not win the coveted crown and rather came second to Ekua from the Central Region of Ghana.</p>
      <p>Well the issue has taken a new turn as the people of Somé Traditional Area where Enam comes from have threatened to boycott the program in future.</p>
      <p>According to the chiefs in a letter copied to www.ghanaweb.com, they monitored the contest from beginning to end and realized several attempts by the producers of the show, the judges and some of the contestants at frustrating their representative, Enam into giving up.</p>
      <p>The chiefs believe despite all the flawless delivery of Enam throughout the entire duration of the programme, she was still frustrated by conspirators around her which include TV3, the judges and the contestants.</p>
      <p>They said there was no doubt that there was an orchestrated and well-executed plan to deny Enam the crown and because of that, they have decided to boycott any competition organized by TV3 Network.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/central-regions-ekua-wins-ghanas-most-beautiful-2019/">Ekua Mends Bannerman of the Central Region won the competition after beating Enam</a> from the Volta Region, Saah from the Western North, Ayisha from the Upper East and Serwaa from the Ashanti Region.</p>
