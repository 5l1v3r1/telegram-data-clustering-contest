      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> couldn't believe their eyes last night, when Maya Stepney was released from prison and delivered possibly her biggest bombshell yet - she's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-stunned-as-maya-returns-pregnant/">expecting a baby</a>.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday night (November 19), the teacher who groomed schoolboy Jacob and convinced him they were in a consensual relationship stepped free from jail looking heavily pregnant.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And fans went into speculation overdrive at the shock twist!</p>
      <p>Although some were <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-disappointed-with-maya-pregnancy-twist/">disappointed with the storyline</a> linking the abuser to the abused with a baby - if it's Jacob's - others found sport in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-predict-huge-baby-twist-for-pregnant-groomer-maya-stepney/">guessing the identity of the father</a>.</p>
      <aside>There continue to be no current plans for the character of Maya to return.</aside>
      <p>Some fans have predicted that the baby might actually be Jacob's dad David's, as mucky Maya was sleeping with them both at the same time.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Others believe her ex-husband Dr Liam Cavanagh could be the daddy, which might explain <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-a-shock-revelation-throws-bernice-and-liams-wedding-into-jeopardy/">Bernice's departure in the coming weeks</a>.</p>
      <p>As the news sunk in with viewers, there were some who were frustrated that the uncomfortable storyline was being dragged out even longer.</p>
      <p>However, a spokesperson for the ITV soap has revealed that Maya will NOT be returning to the village!</p>

      <p>An Emmerdale spokesperson told <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/emmerdale/a29854375/emmerdale-spoilers-is-maya-stepney-returning/">Digital Spy</a>: "Louisa [Clein] filmed that scene earlier this year whilst she was still with us.</p>
      <p>"There continue to be no current plans for the character of Maya to return."</p>
      <p>Emmerdale's producer Kate Brooks had also previously ruled out a return for Maya in the near future.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.insidesoap.co.uk/">Inside Soap</a> in October, she explained: "Maya was so multilayered that it feels as though we only just scratched the surface with her. Louisa is a tremendous actress, but there are no plans as yet."</p>

      <p>In upcoming Emmerdale scenes, Jacob - unaware he could be a future father - will attempt to get over Maya by <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdales-jacob-raping-paedo-maya-leanna/">pursuing his relationship with Leanna Cavanagh</a>.</p>
      <p>Next week, he also agrees to see a counsellor – a decision that is supported by his stepfather David.</p>
      <p>In a message to her fans, actress Louisa admitted the "undercover filming" had been "super exciting".</p>
      <p>Messaging her 24,100 Instagram followers, she said: "Well who saw that coming?? Hats off to Emmerdale for keeping that scene secret! Undercover filming was super exciting!! #emmerdale #mayastepney."</p>

      <p>One fan remarked: "Never saw that coming at all."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Exciting! Does this mean you're coming back? Because there has to be more?"</p>
      <p>A third added: "Wow, I was shocked, hope you're back for good, I've missed you."</p>
      <p>Looks like <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-predict-maya-stepney-will-be-back-for-revenge-in-explosive-christmas-storyline/">Maya's fans</a> will have to wait a while for an update on her baby...</p>
