      <p>MADURAI</p>
      <p>The Director of Russ Foundation, M. Berlin Jose, moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday seeking bail.</p>
      <p>Berlin Jose and his employee John Prabakar are currently in judicial custody in connection with a case of sexual assault on a 10-year-old girl, an inmate of a home run by the foundation.</p>
      <p>The Mahila Court in Madurai had denied them bail, following which Berlin Jose filed the plea before the High Court. In his petition, he claimed that he was arrayed as an accused without any basis and the minor was not under his custody or care.</p>
      <p>Hearing his bail plea, Justice G.R. Swaminathan sought details of medical reports of the girl and asked when she was admitted to the home. The case will be taken up for further hearing on Thursday.</p>
      <p>It was alleged that the girl, an inmate of the home at Thondaimanpatti, was sexually assaulted. The duo were arrested by Chatrapatti police under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.</p>
