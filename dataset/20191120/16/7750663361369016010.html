      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> host <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> in their first game after the international break hoping to end a dire run of form.</h2>

      <p>The Gunners are without a win in their last five games across all competitions and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/leicester-city-vs-arsenal_game_92617.html">lost 2-0 last time out against Leicester City.</a></p>
      <p>Pressure is beginning to grow on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> as Arsenal are now eight points adrift of Manchester City in fourth, and have half the points of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">Premier League</a> leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> rounds up the latest injury and suspension news for Arsenal ahead of this fixture.</p>
