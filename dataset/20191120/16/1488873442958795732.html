      <p><i><b><a href="https://goodiochocolate.com/pages/about-us">Goodio</a></b></i>: Nothing says holiday like chocolates! Goodio, a Finnish startup founded in 2015, produces chocolates that are minimally processed, keeping the ingredients as close to their natural state as possible.  The cacao beans originate from organic, non-GMO farms in Peru, Ecuador, and the Congo. Other ingredients such as wild blueberries, sea buckthorn, mint and cranberries are locally produced in Finland. To sweeten the bars, Goodio uses Indonesian and Sri Lankan coconut palm sugar which has a low Glycemic Index. The ingredients undergo stone-grinding for 3 days to achieve its smooth, velvety structure. The chocolates are then packaged in biodegradable wrappers. Goodio’s entire process is transparent, fair and sustainable and results in Nordic-inspired flavors in a chocolate brand for global consumers.</p>

      <p><i><b><a href="https://littlesun.com/about/">Little Sun</a></b></i>: Little Sun’s iconic high-quality portable solar lamp is a great introduction to personal solar-powered light. It’s great for camping, festivals, the beach, or for brightening the home, garden, or balcony. This is also a wonderful gift for kids and young adults as it doubles as a nightlight or for use during playtime. What a cool way to teach them about sustainable living! The lamp features a dimmer so you can easily adjust the brightness of the lamp to what you need. 5 hours of charging in the sun produces more than 50 hours of light at the dimmest setting or 4 hours at the brightest setting.</p>
      <p>The lamp was designed in 2012, by artist Olafur Eliasson and engineer Frederik Ottesen at London’s Tate Modern. Each purchase of a Little Sun via its online store, the company delivers one to someone living off-the-grid at a much lower, locally affordable price. Little Sun’s social business brings clean, reliable, affordable energy to the 1.1 billion people in the world living without electricity while raising awareness for energy access and climate action worldwide. Since 2017, Little Sun Foundation was founded as an extension to the social business. The Foundation brings light to those beyond the reach of Little Sun’s entrepreneurial distribution channels, especially school children, refugees and people affected by natural disasters.</p>

      <p><i><b><a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/about/about-us/?ref=footer">Fairphone</a></b></i>: Gadgets and mobile devices are always on everyone’s holiday wish list.

The components are also reusable/recyclable, with the goal of reducing electronic waste. To date Fairphone has received over <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/field/organizations/funding_total/fairphone">$40.7 million in financing</a> from various sources including Dutch Good Growth Fund and ABN Amro Fund.</p>

Examples of “gifts of time” include “Fresh Forest Air Rather than Perfume” for time spending with someone walking through a forest or a trail. Another example is “Neck Massage Rather than of a Scarf” and “Repair Rather Than Replace” for an offer to repair an item for someone.

      <p><i><b><a href="https://www.soulbottles.de/soulblog/soul-facts/the-soulstory">soulbottles</a></b></i>: Anything to minimize those ubiquitous plastic water bottles, would be good for the environment, right? What about glass bottles with beautiful and colorful prints that are fair, climate neutral, pollutant and plastic free? Soulbottles is a startup based in Berlin that had its origins from two students who are used to drinking tap water on old and used wine and vodka bottles. They started producing in small batches in 2011 after learning how to print designs onto glass. By 2013, they have secured angel investment and launched a successful crowdfunding campaign to produce their first machine-produced bottles. Today they have a wide range of soulbottles that bear beautiful designs, can be engraved for personalisation and comes in both glass and steel. For each soulbottle sold, €1 is given to drinking water projects. The bottles are produced fair to both employees and producers.</p>
