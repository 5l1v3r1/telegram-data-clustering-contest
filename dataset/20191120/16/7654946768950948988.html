      <p>A Utah inmate awaiting trial for allegedly raping a 13-year-old girl is now accused of trying to hire a hitman to kill her, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>Kristoffer Jones, 29, was hit with extra charges for the alleged murder-for-hire plot while in jail in Hurricane awaiting trial on four counts of rape and one count of aggravated sex abuse of the teenage girl.</p>
      <p>He “solicited several inmates to either kill or assist in coordinating the murder” of his teenage victim to stop her testifying against him, Washington County Sheriff’s Office <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WCSOUT/photos/a.10150639881030471/10162663329415471/?type=3&amp;theater">said Tuesday in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m facing 25 to life for rape of a child that I never committed, &amp; I need the b—- to disappear for good,” he told one inmate, according to a probable cause statement <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/19/murder-hire-charges-utah/">obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune</a>.</p>
      <p>An undercover officer in the Purgatory Correctional Facility gathered evidence that Jones took “substantial steps” to have the girl killed, the sheriff’s office said.</p>
      <p>He agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of money to the would-be killer within 30 days of his release, writing a note with the dollar amount “with a ‘guarantee’ on it,” police wrote in the documents.</p>
      <p>He also “drew a map of the apartment complex and the specific building and apartment” where the 13-year-old lives, providing information about her school and parents’ schedules, the report says.</p>
      <p>Jones finally took a video call from the undercover agent posing as the hitman — confirming he was at the girl’s apartment.</p>
      <p>The undercover agent gave Jones “one last chance to back out,” asking “if he wanted him to follow through” — with Jones insisting, “Yes,” according to the report.</p>
      <p>Jones now faces two counts of criminal solicitation to commit murder, first-degree felonies. Those new charges carry a possible punishment of between five years and life in prison, the Tribune noted.</p>
