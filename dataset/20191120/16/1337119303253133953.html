      <h1>Fortnite Chapter 2’s first season extended into 2020 as Epic teases a new ‘live experience’</h1>
      <h2>It sounds like another holiday-themed event is on the way</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:56:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>In October, <i>Fortnite</i> emerged from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end">a black hole</a> with a new look, a new map, and a new two-month season to earn Battle Pass rewards. Now, that season has been extended all the way until early February 2020, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">Epic announced in a short blog post today</a>.</p>
      <p>The company didn’t give much reason for the extension beyond wanting to prepare for “new holiday-themed updates.” Epic’s blog post also teases “new game features, free rewards and a live experience that you won’t want to miss.” Maybe that live experience will be this season’s big live event? Or perhaps players will have the chance to take down a new creature like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937990/fortnite-chapter-2-fortnitemares-storm-king-zombies">Fortnitemares’ Storm King</a>.</p>
      <p>Last December, Epic put on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18148399/fortnite-snowball-launcher-holiday-christmas-new-years">14 Days of <i>Fortnite</i> event</a>, with daily holiday-themed challenges and rewards, and this year’s holiday celebration seems like it could be similar. One thing we know for sure: these teases are making me excited to switch to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1X9HSeeezXk"><i>Fortnite</i>’s holiday lobby music</a>, which I will promptly do the day after Thanksgiving.</p>
