      <h1>It's Go Home On Time Day (So GO HOME ON TIME!)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/chris-jager" target="_blank">Chris Jager</a></address>
      <p>"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." This is the tagline to <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</i>. It's also the basic premise of Go Home On Time Day, which is currently in its 12th year. So who's taking part this year? Anyone? Anyone?</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/06/australian-health-insurance-a-big-rip-off/">a recent NATSEM study</a>, around 50 per cent of Australians work more than 40 hours per week; often in unpaid overtime.</p>
      <p>It's for this reason that we need Go Home On Time Day. As its name implies, it encourages workers to clock off at a reasonable time instead of staying back for the umpteenth time that week. In short, it's a chance to recognise that life doesn't have to revolve around work</p>
      <p>Here's the blurb from the website:</p>
      <blockquote>Are you a slave to your smartphone? Do you struggle to juggle work demands with the school run? Are you stressed about working more or less hours than you want to?<br/><br/>The fact is, a poor work/life balance has a direct impact on your health, relationships and workplace. Go Home on Time Day on Wednesday is a great way to recognise that life doesn't need to revolve around work.</blockquote>
      <p>It's certainly a valid sentiment and one we're sure Ferris Bueller would approve of. Unfortunately, putting it into practice - even for a single day of the year - is easier said than done.</p>
