      <h1>Stephen King Joins the Funko Universe with a Bloody Pop!</h1>

      <p>Horror legend <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/stephen-king/">Stephen King</a>'s place in history will be further cemented as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/funko/">Funko</a> has announced not one but two vinyl figures for the Funko Pop! Icons line.</p>
      <p>"Bring home the artistic luminary, best-selling novelist Pop! Stephen King," <a href="https://www.funko.com/blog/article/coming-soon-pop-icons-stephen-king">Funko</a> declared on its website.</p>

      <p>The first figure captures King's genius and trademark "everyman" appeal by showing his signature metal-framed silver glasses. He is seen holding a leather-bound notebook while sporting a black long-sleeved sweater and gray slacks. Funko even added a hint of personality by giving King a confident stance with one hand in his pocket.</p>
      <p>King also gets a Barnes and Noble exclusive Pop! that captures the blood, gore and terror many readers have grown accustomed to as the figure holds an ax in one hand and a book in the other with blood dripping from his hair. This is seemingly a nod to such King classics as <i>Misery</i> and <i>The Shining</i>.</p>

      <p>In his 50-plus years as a published author, King has sold over 350 million copies worldwide (many as himself and others under pen names). Many of his works have been adapted to film, television and comics.</p>
      <p>The Stephen King Funko Pop! has yet to receive a release date, though Funko's website assures it's coming soon.</p>
