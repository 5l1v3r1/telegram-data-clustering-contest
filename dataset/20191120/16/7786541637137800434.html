      <p>Brooks Koepka has withdrawn from the Presidents Cup because of a knee injury he suffered last month in South Korea.</p>
      <p>He was replaced by Rickie Fowler.</p>
      <p>Koepka is the No. 1 player in the world and was the leading qualifier for the Presidents Cup, which will be played Dec. 12-15 at Royal Melbourne in Australia.</p>
      <p>U.S. captain Tiger Woods had an extra pick and used it on Fowler.</p>
      <p>Koepka says he has been in contact with Woods and told him that despite constant rehabilitation, he was not able to play.</p>
      <p>He had stem cell treatment on his left knee during the short offseason, and then slipped on a wet piece of cement during the CJ Cup, which caused him to withdraw and return home to Florida to seek treatment.</p>
