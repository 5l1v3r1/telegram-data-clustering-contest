      <p>The former Reds striker had his say after the win over Derby.</p>
      <p>"Defensively they look solid and that's something Forest have struggled with through the years," Harewood told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I would love them to earn promotion. Top six is an aim but hopefully they are pushing for a top-two spot."</p>
      <p>Chris Powell, a former Rams player and coach, then gave his verdict on the make-up of Lamouchi's current promotion chasers.</p>
      <p>"Forest are a really interesting team because they are not possession based. They like the opposition to have the ball," he said.</p>
      <p>"They like to break with pace and have real attacking talents. They are going to be there or thereabouts for sure. They have got some real strength in depth."</p>

      <h4>'Brought pride and passion back'</h4>
      <h4>Don Goodman on Sabri Lamouchi</h4>
      <p>“Forest managers have struggled to reach the levels their fans expect of them for some time, but in Sabri Lamouchi, they finally have someone who looks capable of bringing the good times back to the City Ground.</p>
      <p>“Given a full close season with the squad, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bringing-back-passion-experts-reveal-3415616">the Frenchman has brought pride and passion back</a> and has Forest in an unfamiliar position, fighting at the top end of the table.’’</p>

      <h4>'Well coached and well structured'</h4>
      <h4>Gary Rowett on Sabri Lamouchi's personality</h4>
      <p>"You look at some clubs that take a while to get going. He's gone in there instantly, into a different division he openly admits he doesn't know much about.</p>
      <p>"You can see the quality of his work with the way they defend, with the discipline and the compactness.</p>
      <p>"You see his demeanour, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/pundit-explains-sabri-lamouchis-personality-3371067">it's assured and composed and it seems he's transmitting that to his players.</a></p>
      <p>"They've been in and around it most of the time in the last five or six years, even if it's just for three month spells.</p>
      <p>"Sabri Lamouchi is a very good (piece of) recruitment by the owners. If you look at this record, he's got something like a 50 percent win record in his career.</p>
      <p>"He's a manager who has performed consistently in different countries in different competitions."</p>
      <p>"At the moment, you have to say they're really well coached and well structured.</p>
      <p>"He's picked certain teams for certain games. They've gone about it really impressively.</p>
      <p>"They've tended to counter attack in away games and they've done it really impressively. The first goal at Fulham was a brilliant footballing goal.</p>
      <p>"Then they'll drop in and be solid and disciplined. When they win the ball they can transition really well."</p>

      <h4>'Saying the right things'</h4>
      <h4>David Prutton on Forest's chances this season</h4>
      <p>"Forest are a massive club so you don't raise your eyebrows when they beat anyone in this league, but they've had good results at teams expected to be automatic promotion contenders in Leeds and Fulham.</p>
      <p>"It feels like the team has a really British foundation and then is complemented by more exotic sounding players.</p>
      <p>"Lamouchi came in making all the right noises. I watched him during the first game and wondered what was going through his head.</p>
      <p>"He played at big clubs alongside great players so he'll know what makes top level players tick.</p>
      <p>"English football, especially the Championship, is really unforgiving, but he's applying himself really well.</p>
      <p>"When he was announced, there must have been a lot of people searching his name, seeing he was Rennes manager and thinking 'oh no, it's another Montanier'.</p>
      <p>"Lamouchi's tenure is in his infancy, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/after-early-alarm-bells-sabri-3318476">but he's saying the right things and he's set up a team that is hard to beat and can score goals.</a></p>
      <h4>'A really good player'</h4>
      <h4>Matt Murray on Tyler Walker</h4>
      <p>"He went to Mansfield and did well. He's doing well this season, scoring all types of goals.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/hes-getting-more-more-cultured-3295546">"He's got loads of pace and he's getting more and more cultured with his finishing.</a>
      </p>
      <p>"He's a really good player. Lincoln used to be 4-4-2 but now they're changing by bringing in players like Jorge Grant, who also came from Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>"Walker can lead the line, but he can stretch teams in behind. Forest are having their player's value added to, but for Tyler, it's a chance to learn and improve."</p>

      <h4>'A disgrace'</h4>
      <h4>Chris Sutton on sacking Martin O'Neill after the defeat to West Brom</h4>
      <p>"You know what, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/chris-sutton-rants-nottingham-forest-3173011">sacking of Martin O'Neill was a disgrace really.</a></p>
      <p>"There were rumours that the players had a part in his sacking. If that's true, what has the game come to?</p>
      <p>"Where did they finish last season? Ninth or tenth?</p>
      <p>"I've never understood players who talk to the chairman and go behind the manager's back.</p>
      <p>"They were my team as a boy. European Cup winners, but the club is in a mess.</p>
      <p>"Modern football. Martin O'Neill did not get long enough."</p>
