      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:24:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/PRESS-TRUST-OF-INDIA-6101/" target="_blank">PRESS TRUST OF INDIA</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan has been forced to pick two rookie 17-year-olds for its Davis Cup encounter against a full-strength Indian squad, after senior players Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and Aqeel Khan pulled out protesting against the tie being shifted to a neutral venue.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan Tennis Federation named teenagers Huzaifa Abdul Rehman and Shoaib Khan, both of whom are ranked 446 and 1004 respectively in the junior ITF ranking list.</p>
      <p>Yousuf Khan and Ahmad Kamil, also teenagers, along with Amjad complete the squad.</p>
      <p>With Pakistan’s top players Aisam and Aqeel pulling out of the tie in protest against shifting out of matches to a neutral venue, the PTF was left with no option but to pick junior players.</p>
      <p>“It could have been a good tie but for India. We are sending junior players. Our senior Davis Cup team is not coming. We are sending our junior Davis Cup team. They are all 16-17 years old and will gain some experience,” PTF President Salim Saifullah Khan told PTI.</p>
