      <h1>Government to seek Dáil approval for extra €634m spend</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:38:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/martin-wall-7.1054630" target="_blank">Martin Wall</a></address>
      <p>The Government will ask the Dáil to approve additional spending of more than €630 million for Government departments and agencies this year .</p>
      <p>Minister for Public Expenditure <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paschal+Donohoe">Paschal Donohoe</a> on Tuesday brought proposals to Cabinet for supplementary estimates to the value of €430 million.</p>
      <p>The largest supplementary estimate, for €338 million, was for the health service.</p>
      <p>Last week Mr Donohoe brought proposals for 11 other supplementary estimates, eight substantive and three technical, to an overall value of €204 million.</p>

      <p>The Department of Public Expenditure said the total cost of the supplementary estimates earmarked for Government departments and agencies this year was €634 million. It said this was below the original projection of €660 million which was set out in its expenditure report for 2020 which was published in October.</p>
      <p>The Department of Public Expenditure said the additional €338 million for the health service was is required “to meet costs relating to demand-led pressures in key service areas, primarily in acute hospitals, in both pay and non-pay areas, disabilities, older persons, high-tech drugs, State claims and pensions budget lines”.</p>
      <h3>Where are the funds going?</h3>
      <p>Among proposals for other supplementary estimates brought to the Cabinet by Mr Donohoe on Tuesday were €68million for the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Department+of+Education+and+Skills">Department of Education and Skills</a>, €19million for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, €4million for Revenue and €500,000 for the Public Appointment Service.</p>
      <p>Among the supplementary estimate proposals brought by the Minister to Government last week were €100 million for the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Department+of+Social+Protection">Department of Social Protection</a> to meet some of the cost of the Christmas bonus for those in receipt of social welfare payments as well as €51 million for the Department of Justice, €21 million for the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Department+of+Finance">Department of Finance</a>, €10 million for the Department of Transport for tourism initiatives, €5 million for the Office of the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Chief+State">Chief State</a> Solicitors Office and €15 million for <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Department+of+Children+and+Youth+Affairs">Department of Children and Youth Affairs</a></p>
      <p>The Department of Public Expenditure said that underspending in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Department+of+Defence">Department of Defence</a> allocation – due in part to fewer military personnel than anticipated – would be used to offset additional expenditure required to meet the cost of Army pensions.</p>
      <p>The supplementary estimates will be put before the Dáil this week and then considered in greater details by various <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas">Oireachtas</a> committees.</p>
