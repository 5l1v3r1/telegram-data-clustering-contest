      <h1>Georgia Adds New Quarterback Transfer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:58:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Jake Fromm is about as durable a quarterback as you’ll find at the top of college football, but Georgia entered the season with serious depth issues at the position below him, after Justin Fields’ departure for Ohio State. The team was able to add Stetson Bennett <a href="https://thespun.com/news/top-juco-qb-recruit-announces-commitment-to-major-program">back as a scholarship player</a>, after he left Georgia as a walk-on in search of a scholarship opportunity.</p>
      <p>Another quarterback is now set to join the Bulldogs for next season. Austin Kirksey, a Georgia native who went out to play at Nevada, is transferring closer to home.</p>
      <p>Kirksey, a Marietta native, has not played as a freshman for the Wolf Pack. Carson Strong and former <i>Last Chance U </i>star Malik Henry have been the main quarterbacks for Jay Norvell’s program this fall.</p>
      <p>Austin Kirksey will be a walk-on for the Dawgs, as <a href="https://247sports.com/college/georgia/Article/Austin-Kirksey-Georgia-Bulldogs-Football-Nevada-Wolkpack-transfer-138904685/">247Sports</a> has confirmed:</p>
      <blockquote>“Georgia is set to get some much-needed depth in the quarterback room. With the possibility that junior Jake Fromm could leave early for the 2020 NFL Draft and the uncertainty regarding the health of freshman D’Wan Mathis, it could not come at a better time. Nevada freshman Austin Kirksey, who has not seen action this season, will finish out the semester and leave the Wolfpack to walk-on at Georgia in the spring as a redshirt freshman. Dawgs247 has confirmed the news.”</blockquote>
      <p>Norvell spoke about Kirksey’s departure, and was very complimentary of his transferring quarterback.</p>
      <blockquote>“He’s going to move back to Georgia to be close to his family,” Norvell said. “Really sad to see him go. What a great kid. He’s like a straight-A student, an awesome young man and very close to his family. A great family. We’re sad to see him go, but I certainly understand him wanting to be closer to his family.”</blockquote>
      <p>Georgia’s quarterback situation will be in flux next fall if Fromm leaves for the NFL Draft, especially as D’Wan Mathis <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/georgia-bulldogs/dwan-mathis-brain-surgery-recovery-georgia-football">recovers from brain surgery</a>. This may not be the only quarterback addition we see for Kirby Smart’s staff.</p>
