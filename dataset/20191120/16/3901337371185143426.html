      <p>In recent weeks, it has emerged that Los Blancos and Ramos have reached a cross-road in their contract negotiations, prompting speculation around the club captain’s future.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old has reportedly requested a new four-year deal at an annual salary of €16 million (R262 million), which is at odds with Real’s proposed two-plus-one-year deal on his existing salary.</p>
      <p>As a result of the impasse, Ramos has been linked with a transfer away from the LaLiga giants and a move to the Premier League could be a possibility.</p>

      <p>According to <i>Diario GOL</i>, Real have recognized that Spain’s most-capped player of all time could leave the club, and have reportedly picked out Senegal international Kalidou Koulibaly as his replacement.</p>
      <p>Koulibaly currently plies his trade with Napoli in Serie A where has become one of the world’s leading defenders, but would command a transfer fee of €75 million (R1.2 billion).</p>
