      <h2>Disclosures to help remove ambiguity</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:58:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Listed companies that default on their loan or interest payments will have to disclose such defaults to the stock exchanges within 31 days of missing the payment deadline.</p>
      <p>The board of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which met on Wednesday , made such disclosures mandatory in the light of many recent instances of default wherein the information was not available to all categories of stakeholders.</p>
      <p>“... in case of any default in repayment of principal or interest on loans from banks or financial institutions which continues beyond 30 days from the pre-agreed payment date, listed entities shall, promptly, but not later than 24 hours from the 30th day, disclose the fact of such default,” stated a statement from the SEBI, while adding that the rules would be applicable from January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, in August 2017, the capital markets regulator had mandated such disclosure within a day of default but had to withdraw the circular due to alleged opposition from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government.</p>
      <p>While addressing the media post the board meet, SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi said that the limit of 31 days was found to be “implementable” and agreed upon by the board that has representation from both, the central bank and the government.</p>
      <p>“Prior to today’s decision, there was ambiguity on the norms related to disclosure of financial default to the stock exchange,” said Makarand Joshi, partner, MMJC and Associates, a corporate advisory firm.</p>
      <p>“Today’s decision by SEBI has put this uncertainty to rest... making the potential risk about the company known to any investor as much as it is known to any insider in the company or the banker,” added Mr. Joshi.</p>
      <p>“So far, the banker has not been disclosing the client or company’s name in case of default, but the subsequent rules on this subject that may follow would also make the banker’s name public in such default, making the process completely transparent.”</p>
      <h3>Change in PMS rules</h3>
      <p>On a different note, the capital market regulator amended the regulatory framework for portfolio managers to enhance their net worth criteria and also the minimum investment size, which will effectively keep retail investors — who can use the mutual fund route — out of the segment that is typically for high net worth individuals.</p>
      <p>While the net worth requirement of portfolio managers has been increased from ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore, the minimum investment by clients has been hiked to ₹50 lakh from the current ₹25 lakh.</p>
      <p>“By increasing the portfolio management services (PMS) limit, SEBI has made it very clear that major section of the retail investor should come via mutual fund route. Customised portfolio management is designated only for HNIs, hence clearly demarcating the customer categories,” said Prakarsh Gagdani, chief executive officer, 5Paisa.com, a discount broking firm.</p>
