      <p>Cincinnati-based Macy's (NYSE: M) informed customers in a letter dated Nov. 14 that it was the victim of a data breach that was discovered about a month earlier on Oct. 15.</p>
      <p>The retailer said that it believes that an unauthorized third party added computer code to its website, macys.com, that allowed the hacker to capture checkout and wallet page information.</p>
      <p>The code was removed from Macy's website on Oct. 15 and the company brought in federal law enforcement and a forensics firm to investigate.</p>
