      <h1>Le’Veon Bell hits NFL drug-test breaking point: Done with ‘dirty a– needles’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:32:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Justin Terranova</a></address>
      <p>The Jets’ struggling offensive line isn’t LeVeon Bell’s only NFL problem this season.</p>
      <p>The star running back <a href="https://twitter.com/LeVeonBell/status/1197180240742797313">ranted on Twitter</a> about the league’s aggressive drug-testing schedule.</p>
      <p>“I done had 5 ‘random’ HGH blood test in 10 weeks… @NFL I’m not doing another after today, whatever y’all lookin for it obviously ain’t there &amp; I’m not about to keep allowing y’all to stick me with those dirty a– needles..find the players who really do that HGH BS &amp; get off me..,” Bell wrote on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Bell, who sat out last season over a contract impasse with the Steelers, is not the first NFL star to complain about testing. Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham recently <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/odell-beckham-thinks-hes-a-target-for-nfl-drug-tests/">ripped the league for the timing and regularity of his drug tests.</a></p>
      <p>League spokesman Brian McCarthy did not address Beckham’s accusations directly, but did speak to how the process works.</p>
      <p>“Neither the union or the league are involved in the random selection of players to be tested,” <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/nfl-wont-respond-specifically-to-odell-beckham-jr-saying-hes-ped-tested-more-than-anyone-but-stands-by-random-nature-of-testing.html">McCarthy told Cleveland.com</a>. “By means of a computer program, the independent administrator determines which 10 players will be randomly selected each week.”</p>
      <p>It’s been a frustrating first season for Bell with the 3-7 Jets, as he has struggled to make an impact on a mostly inept offense after signing a four-year, $52.5 million deal this offseason.</p>
