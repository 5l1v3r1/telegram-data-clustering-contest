      <p>A durable cookware set from Calphalon is one of the smartest adult investments you can make. Calphalon's heavy-gauge hard-anodized aluminum gets a lot of praise for its even heating and prevention of food burning to the bottom. The set includes a 7-quart Dutch oven with a lid, a 3-quart sauté pan with a lid, a 1-quart and 2-quart saucepan with lids, and a 10-inch and 8-inch omelette pan. All pieces are oven and broiler safe up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and feature measure markings inside.</p>
      <p>Macy's original price seems to be a bit inflated, but this particular set is at its full price of $249.99 on <a href="https://zdcs.link/NpXby">Calphalon's website</a>. If you don't need this many pieces, there's also a <a href="https://zdcs.link/LGxd0">3-piece T-Fal fry pan and skillet set on sale for $12.99</a>.</p>
