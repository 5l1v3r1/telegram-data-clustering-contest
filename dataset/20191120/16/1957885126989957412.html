      <p>FIFA 20 will get the Copa Libertadores tournament exclusively in March 2020, EA Sports has announced.</p>
      <p>South America's biggest club tournament hits the game as part of a free update that also includes the Sudamericana and Recopa. The update is for the PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game. EA's note to press does not mention the Switch version, which will come as no surprise to FIFA fans who play on Nintendo's console.</p>

      <p>The update adds a host of new clubs from Uruguay, Perú, Paraguay, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina and more, such as River Plate, Boca Juniors, Flamengo, Corinthians, Racing, Indepentiente U. Católica and Colo-Colo.</p>
      <p>It's worth picking out Argentinian arch rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors, which are mentioned by EA as a teams coming to FIFA 20 in the update. These teams are not officially licensed currently in FIFA 20, although they are in the game under unlicensed names (Núñez and Buenos Aires). With the update, FIFA 20 will be able to authentically recreate the dramatic Copa Libertadores final of 2018, which saw its return leg played at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid, Spain, due to a lack of security in Buenos Aires.</p>
