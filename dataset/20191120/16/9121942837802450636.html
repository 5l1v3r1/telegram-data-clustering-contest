      <h1>Amnesty International calls Facebook, Google rights abusers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:15:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/frank-bajak/" target="_blank">FRANK BAJAK</a></address>
      <p>Amnesty International has issued a scathing indictment of Google and Facebook.</p>
      <p>It says the two most dominant internet corporations should be compelled to abandon what it calls their surveillance-based business model, saying it is “predicated on human rights abuse.”</p>
      <p>The global rights group says in the 60-page report published Thursday that the companies’ business model is “inherently incompatible with the right to privacy and poses a threat to a range of other rights” including freedom of expression and non -discrimination.</p>
      <p>The report says the business model forces people to make a “Faustian bargain” because Google and Facebook have grown to dominate the global public square.</p>
      <p>In a written response, Facebook disputes the report’s conclusion that it surveils its users and violates their privacy. Google also disputed the findings.</p>
