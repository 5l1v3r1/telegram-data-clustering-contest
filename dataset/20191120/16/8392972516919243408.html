      <p>David Platt is set to have one last face off with rapist Josh Tucker in court in upcoming <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> scenes.</p>
      <p>In the episodes <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-david-platt/">David</a> will have to stand against Josh, who is currently on remand for sexual assault.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10382932/coronation-street-david-platt-rapist-josh/">pictures obtained by The Sun</a>, it shows David and Josh actors <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-coronation-streets-jack-p-shepherd/">Jack P. Shepherd</a> and Ryan Clayton filming on location.</p>
      <p>It looks like Josh is dressed for court as he wears a suit, but the publication suggests David could have a meltdown.</p>

      <p>The haidresser is seen approaching his attacker in the street and the ensuing argument looks more than a little heated.</p>
      <p>Will David lash out? And could it jeopardise his case against Josh?</p>
      <p>The last time David saw Josh was in prison.</p>
      <p>David, who was inside for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-horror-as-nick-escapes-prison-but-david-gets-four-months/">stealing money from his gran Audrey</a>, was encouraged by his fellow<a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-david-kills-josh-in-a-prison-riot/"> inmates to attack his rapist during the prison riots</a>.</p>
      <p>However David decided to help Josh instead, and tried to get him away from the other prisoners.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-josh-frames-david-for-attempted-murder/">Josh went on to frame David for attempted murder</a> when he was stabbed during the riots, meaning David had to spend longer in prison.</p>
      <p>However, he soon came clean after being pressured by <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-rejoice-as-paul-foreman-gets-confession-from-rapist-josh-tucker/">Paul Foreman to tell the truth and David was released from prison</a>.</p>

      <p>After <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-think-shona-got-married-in-a-towel/">marrying Shona Ramsey</a>, David was relieved when his brother <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-nick-tilsley/">Nick</a> told him the Crown Prosecution Service were reviving David's rape allegation against Josh.</p>
      <p>Last year Josh began working as a mechanic for Kevin and soon befriended David.</p>
      <p>On a night out Josh spiked David's drink and raped him and the next day tried to convince him they had consensual sex.</p>
