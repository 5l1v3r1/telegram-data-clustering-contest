      <h1>A 90mph zip wire that will take forty seconds to complete is coming to Margam Country Park</h1>
      <h2>It will be one of the longest anywhere in Europe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:36:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:36</time> by <a rel="author">Elizabeth Bradfield</a></address>
      <p>Plans have been revealed for a £3m investment in one of Neath Port Talbot’s historic country parks, involving one of the “longest and greenest” zip wires in Europe.</p>
      <p>The plans for <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/margam">Margam</a> Country Park include two zipwires – a 1.5km one which will take 40 seconds to complete and reach speeds of 90mph, and a safari one which takes two hours to complete.</p>
      <p>The park, which is set in 800 acres of parkland, includes the 19th century Margam Castle, 18th century Orangery and monastic ruins.</p>
      <p>The safari zipwire will see visitors able to unhook and explore various features at certain points along the way before clipping back on and continuing their descent.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/neath-port-talbot-council">local authority’s</a> cabinet approved the funding at a meeting on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>Council leader Rob Jones said: “There will be electric vehicles taking you through the forest and the deer park up to the top of the zip wire.</p>
      <p>“We will also have a children’s zone with attractions being up to £500k in their own right.”</p>

      <p>The council plans to put an Aquasplash in the eastern end of the park, turn the old manager’s house on site into a cafe, and link into work currently being undertaken by the Friends of Margam Park, which is refurbishing the hidden garden.</p>
      <p>Cllr Jones said: “There will be two areas – an adrenaline zone and an adventure zone.</p>
      <p>“We are employing a company that are world leaders in zipwires, having put them across the Grand Canyon and in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>“The zipwire helmets will have things like video cameras so you can video your experience as you fly over the park.</p>
      <p>“Initial consent has been approved for the investment – it will be subject to regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very exciting time for Margam Park.</p>
      <p>“We commissioned the tourism unit last year and this shows further commitment by Neath Port Talbot Council to invest in tourism and generating a better experience for visitors to the park.”</p>
      <p>The £2.8m investment is being made predominantly through borrowing.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Neath Port Talbot Council launched a business plan to “exploit all appropriate commercial activities and opportunities” to reduce its subsidy and make it self sufficient in the long term.</p>
      <p>Over that time it has brought in more weddings, introduced deer safaris, invited in film companies and overhauled catering.</p>
      <p>Last week the park won the best large attraction award in the Swansea Bay Tourism Awards with the Orangery coming second for the best wedding large venue category.</p>
