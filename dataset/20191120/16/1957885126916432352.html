      <p>Where will you be looking for an Xbox One on Black Friday? GAME? Amazon? Argos? Wrong! Get out of the house and get yourself to Lidl.</p>
      <p>Lidl's latest deals brochure is out in the wild and eagle-eyed shoppers have spotted that the low-cost retailer will be selling an Xbox One S All-Digital Edition for only £129 on Black Friday. That's a huge £70 off the recommended price of the console, which comes bundled with copies of Minecraft, Sea of Thieves and Forza Horizon 3, making it an early contender for one of the best <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-15-xbox-black-friday-deals-2019">Xbox One Black Friday deals</a> this year.</p>

      <p>Now, the very important thing to keep in mind with this version of the Xbox One S is that it doesn't feature a disc drive. You'll have to get digital versions of all games. However, pair this up with an <a href="https://www.jelly.deals/2019/09/04/best-price-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-game-list/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription</a> and you'll be laughing.</p>
      <p>You can already get access to the likes of Devil May Cry 5, Gears 5 and The Outer Worlds on Game Pass. In the next few months over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-14-x019-announces-over-50-new-games-arriving-on-xbox-game-pass">50 more titles</a> including The Witcher 3, Yakuza and the majority of the Final Fantasy series will also be joining the service.</p>
      <p>How can this get any sweeter? Well, how about the fact that you can get <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass">3 months of Game Pass Ultimate for just £1</a> right now if you're a new subscriber, too.</p>
      <p>Bring it all together and I really can't think of any better value for money deals out there. Good job, Lidl. The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition will be in stores on 29th November.</p>
