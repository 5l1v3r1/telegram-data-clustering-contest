      <h1>Google Wants to Bring Android Closer to the Mainline Linux Kernel</h1>

      <p><b>Google wants to bring Android “as close as possible” to the mainline Linux kernel</b>.</p>
      <p>This noble goal, <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/google-wants-android-to-use-regular-linux-kernel-potentially-improving-updates-and-security">reported by Android Police</a>, was expanded on by Google engineers speaking at the <a href="https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/">Linux Plumbers Conference</a> 2019.</p>
      <p>Though Android is built on top of <b>a</b> Linux kernel, it’s not built atop the same Linux kernel that most desktop Linux distributions use.</p>
      <p>Instead, it uses something called the <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/android-common">Android common kernel</a>. This is heavily modified LTS version that incorporates a bunch of “out of tree” code from chip makers, hardware partners, and Google itself, as well as firmware drivers, quirk workarounds, and other miscellaneous patches.</p>
      <p>Repeat the process for every Android phone out there and you can an idea of how divergent things currently are.</p>
      <h3>Android Linux Kernel</h3>
      <p>Ubuntu Phone, Canonical’s failed attempt at bringing Ubuntu to smartphones, relied heavily on co-opting existing Android devices <i>because</i> it re-used the existing Android Linux kernel available.</p>
      <p>But a new bread of ARM-based smartphones, including the Librem 5 and the PinePhone, are targeting mainline Linux support as a feature.</p>
      <p>And Google is clearly thinking along the same lines.</p>
      <p>Just don’t confuse Google’s wishes with reality. This is something they’ve been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/771974/">talking about for a while</a>, and are making plenty of progress on.</p>
      <p>But this all remains some way off happening.</p>
      <h4>“Major technical and political changes”</h4>
      <p>Switching Android to run on the mainline Linux kernel would be a huge undertaking, one that would inevitably major technical and political changes changes to the way the Linux kernel is currently developed.</p>
      <p>Instead of each Android device shipping its own device-specific Linux kernel, Google’s idea is to upstream as much code as possible, and stabilize Linux’s in-kernel ABI so that there’s stable interface for Linux kernel and hardware vendors to target.</p>
      <p>In short, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/google-outlines-plans-for-mainline-linux-kernel-support-in-android/">as Ars Ron Amadeo sums up</a>, ‘Google wants to decouple the Linux kernel from its hardware support’.</p>
      <p>And that’s unlikely to happen overnight, if ever.</p>
