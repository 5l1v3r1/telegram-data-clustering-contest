      <p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege/">Rainbow Six Siege</a>’s latest limited-time event kicks off today, and this one’s a bit of an unexpected crossover wit the Netflix series La Casa De Papel (or Money Heist in the English-speaking world). For those who haven’t watched the show, Money Heist is the ultra-detailed account of the planning and execution of a hostage taking and robbery at the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid. So, as you would expect, the Money Heist event revolves around a hostage scenario in Siege’s Bank level. You can check out a quick trailer for the Money Heist event, below.</p>
