      <h2>IRDAI exempts 16 classes of claims from the purview of surveyors, loss assessors</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:25:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/N-Ravi-Kumar-21532/" target="_blank">N.Ravi Kumar</a></address>
      <p>The process of claiming insurance is set to become easier, at least in certain cases, with IRDAI, regulator for the insurance sector, notifying as many as 16 classes of claims that will no longer require the intervention of a licensed surveyor or loss assessor (SLA).</p>
      <p>The regulator’s order, in other words, is aimed at cutting down on the time taken for the claim settlement process. This is sought to be done by doing away with the assessment by SLAs and going with other documents substantiating the damage or incident such as a police report.</p>
      <p>Under the existing practise, SLA report forms an integral part of claims process, if the damages are sought above certain prescribed limits.</p>
      <p>“The Authority hereby exempts the [following] classes of claims...” an Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India order said, listing 16 motor and non-motor claims. These include that, under motor vehicle insurance, made on account of theft or injury/death to third parties and under health insurance policies, including travel and personal accident cove₹</p>
      <p>Some of the other claims exempted are public liability policies, including third party liability, professional indemnity, products liability and personal liability except where liability arising out of property damage or defect to physical property/goods are involved; claims under money insurance, including cash in transit policies; and claims under all risks and burglary insurance policies on personal effects and jewellery.</p>
      <p>Sources in insurance companies said the move would expedite the claim settlement process. In the absence of SLA reports, the companies, however, do their own assessment of the damage. A few companies, in case of motor insurance claims, have introduced a system of settling the claim based on the photographic evidence of the damage caused.</p>
      <p>The IRDAI order comes on the heels of a proposed move to enhance the limit of claims for which SLA report will not be required.</p>
      <p>As per the proposal, motor insurance claims limit for damages upto ₹75,000, as opposed to ₹50,000 now, can be made without SLA report. In the case of non-motor claims, this limit is to be increased from ₹1 lakh to ₹1.5 lakh.</p>
      <p>“We not happy”, Indian Institute of Insurance Surveyors and Loss Assessors (IIISLA) Council Member P.Sowjanya Kumar said since the move is bound to impact the SLAs. Noting that the role of the professionals is to assess the loss without prejudice, he said the changes were likely to lead to a situation where the customers will have accept what the insurers offered.</p>
      <p>Also figuring in the exempt list are claims under race horses insurance policies and live-stock insurance policies; in respect of loss or damage to crop, trees, plantations and forests which are covered by government sponsored schemes; and claims, the amount of which has been adjudicated upon or decreed by courts.</p>
