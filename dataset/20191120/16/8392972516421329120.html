      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> have complained that the show is on too late.</p>
      <p>The episodes usually start at 9pm on ITV and run until either 10pm or 10:30pm.</p>
      <p>But for some fans, it's on too late and they've asked ITV to put the episodes on at an earlier time.</p>

      <p>One person said on Twitter: "Think it’s a bit selfish of ITV to assume everyone will be awake at 9 to watch I'm A Celeb."</p>

      <p>Another wrote: "As much as I’m loving I’m A Celeb being back on, I’m so glad it finished at 10pm tonight, going to bed at almost 11 was a struggle for someone who’s in bed sleeping for half 9 every night."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Why can’t @imacelebrity start at 8.00/8.30 rather than 9? It’s far too much of a commitment to stay awake until 10pm when you have 2 kids up at the crack of dawn!"</p>
