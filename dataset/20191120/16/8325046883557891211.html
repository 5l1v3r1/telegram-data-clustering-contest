      <h3>Who is Wayne Messam?</h3>
      <p><b>Current job: </b>Mayor of Miramar, FL and construction business owner.</p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> 45.</p>
      <p><b>Family:</b> Messam and his wife Angela have two twin daughters and a son.</p>
      <p><b>Hometown:</b> Born and raised in South Bay, Florida.</p>
      <p><b>Political party: </b>Democratic.</p>
      <p><b>Previous jobs:</b> Miramar city commissioner.</p>
      <h3>Who was Wayne Messam’s direct competition for the nomination?</h3>
      <p>Based on a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/2020-election-methodology">recurring series of national surveys</a> we conduct, we can figure out who the other candidates competing in Messam’s lane are, and who the broader opponents are within the party.</p>
      <p>INSIDER has been conducting a recurring poll through SurveyMonkey Audience on a national sample to find out how different candidate’s constituencies overlap. We ask people whether they are familiar with a candidate, whether they would be satisfied or unsatisfied with that candidate as nominee, and sometimes we also ask whether they think that person would win or lose in a general election against President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Messam has not reached the level of prominence to be included in this poll.</p>

            <li>Messam supports providing a pathway to citizenship to the nation’s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.</li>
            <li>“We should provide a pathway for citizenship to those individuals who are contributing to our society and the overwhelming majority are law-abiding individuals,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/florida-mayor-wayne-messam-on-2020-chances-americans-see-that-mayors-get-the-job-done/">Messam said</a>.</li>
            <li>As mayor, Messam <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-messam-sanctuary-city-20190321-story.html">helped pass a resolution</a> demanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement improve conditions at its local office by adding more restrooms and waiting areas, and pushed to make Miramar a sanctuary city.</li>

            <li>Messam <a href="https://wayneforusa.com/climate-change-acting-in-time-to-save-lives/">has called</a> for “bold, direct climate action” that “rivals the New Deal in scope.”</li>
            <li>“It’s more than just responding to climate change. It would fortify our infrastructure but it will put people to work, and it’ll be an economic stimulus as well,” Messam said of his plan to combat climate change, though it lacks specifics.</li>
            <li>The Miramar mayor <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-ne-everglades-oil-drilling-statement-20190206-story.html">also fought</a> to stop the construction of an oil well in the Everglades and criticized the Trump administration for withdrawing from the Paris climate accord.</li>

        </li>
        <li>

            <li>The Miramar mayor <a href="https://wayneforusa.com/democracy-reform-rebuilding-our-system-from-the-ground-up/">is also promising</a> to overturn Citizens United to “get rid of money in politics.”</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>abortion:</b></p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>education:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Messam supports forgiving all of the $1.6 trillion in student debt held by 45 million Americans, a proposal also being pushed by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Sen. Bernie Sanders.</a></li>
            <li>“This is a big issue … and its especially hurting people of color, who need financial aid to get a higher education” Messam said of his student debt elimination proposal <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN7iX-4EgZs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">in an interview</a> on “The Breakfast Club” radio show.</li>
            <li>Messam is also calling for more access to early child education and raising teachers’ wages.</li>
            <li>“As President, I will make early child education accessible for every child. It’s a matter of socio-economic security to ensure we start education the moment a child is born,” <a href="https://twitter.com/WayneMessam/status/1154475009517113344?s=20">Messam tweeted.</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>On <b>guns:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Messam said he’d make the prevention of mass shootings his first priority if elected.</li>
            <li>The Miramar mayor has also prioritized cutting the gun death rate in half by the end of his first term as president.</li>
            <li>Under Messam’s mayoral administration, Miramar joined a lawsuit to bar the state government from preempting cities who want to regulate gun laws on their own.</li>
            <li>He’s <a href="https://www.wlrn.org/post/you-didnt-hear-miramar-mayor-wayne-messam-debates-week-he-still-wants-be-president">described being part of the lawsuit</a> as “a sensible thing to do.”</li>

            <li>During his mayoral tenure, Messam <a href="https://miramarculturalcenter.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=246&amp;amp;ARC=583">passed</a> a “Ban the Box” initiative that removes criminal history questions on applications for city government jobs.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Messam is calling for the repeal of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, saying that it benefits the wealthy and corporations too much over the average American.</li>
            <li>Unter Messam’s watch, the city in 2015 <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/messam-says-as-mayor-of-diverse-city-hes-ready-to-lead-unify-nation/27574699">passed a law</a> that established “a living wage” for city employees, <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/miramar/fl-cn-wage-0517-20150514-story.html">though the salary bump</a> from $8 to around $12 an hour affected only ten percent of the municipal workforce.</li>
