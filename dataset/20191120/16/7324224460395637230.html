      <p>Deven Patel-Reddy, 18, broke into five houses between December 2018 and March 2019 by smashing windows and patio doors.</p>
      <p>In the first incident, he smashed the window of a house in Brocton and stole thousands of pounds worth of electrical items including an iPad, Sony laptop and camera equipment.</p>
      <p>He also took valuable jewellery and bottles of alcohol and damaged several other items within the house.</p>
      <p>Patel-Reddy then went on to break into four more houses where he stole alcohol and cigarettes which police later found on him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile DNA analysis of knife and blood found in one of the homes was linked to the burglar.</p>
      <p>He attempted to commit burglaries at two other addresses and was spotted climbing through a bathroom window by one of the victims who was at home at the time.</p>
      <p>Patel-Reddy, from Brocton, pleaded guilty to five counts of burglary and two counts of attempted burglary and was sentenced at Stafford Crown Court on Friday.</p>
      <p>Det Con Daniel Champeau, from Staffordshire Police, said: “We are glad to see a serial offender taken off the streets.</p>
      <p>"He broke into several homes within the area, causing distress to those living within the properties and stealing valuable items whilst causing serious damage.</p>
      <p>"These crimes are serious offences and will not be tolerated in Staffordshire.”</p>
