        <li>President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-childhood-neighborhood-queens-new-york-city-photos-2018-11">Donald Trump’s childhood home</a> in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/new-york-city">New York City</a> failed to sell at <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-critics-are-raising-money-to-buy-his-childhood-home/">a November 14 auction</a>, Jennifer Gould Keil reported for The New York Post.</li>
        <li>The five-bedroom, Tudor-style Queens home was put up for auction after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-critics-are-raising-money-to-buy-his-childhood-home/">failing to sell for its asking price of $2.9 million</a> earlier this year.</li>
        <li>The home was most recently sold at auction <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/realestate/trump-childhood-home-auction-queens.html">for $2.14 million in March 2017.</a></li>
        <li>Back in August 2017, the home was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/05/donald-trumps-childhood-home-listed-for-2-9-million/">listed on Airbnb</a> for $725 per night.</li>
        <li>The home sits on a quiet street in Jamaica Estates, an affluent neighborhood in Queens about a 40-minute drive from <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/manhattan">Manhattan</a>.</li>

      <p>President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/donald-trump">Donald Trump’s</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/new-york-city">New York City</a> childhood home, where he lived until he was 4 years old, failed to sell at <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/trump-critics-are-raising-money-to-buy-his-childhood-home/">a November 14 auction</a>, The New York Post reported.</p>
      <p>The home was previously <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/keithflamer/2019/02/12/president-trumps-childhood-home-lists-for-2-9-million/">listed for $2.9 million in February,</a> pulled off the market just 10 days later, and then went to auction house Paramount Realty USA.</p>
      <p>Misha Haghani, founder of <a href="https://www.prusa.com/auctions/trumps-childhood-home-2019/">Paramount Realty USA</a>, told Business Insider that the November auction was postponed because the auction house received no acceptable bids. The home has an undisclosed minimum price, meaning the auction house can refuse any offer below that.</p>
      <p>Haghani said the auction was delayed to give those interested in crowdfunding the purchase of the home more time to raise money. Some groups want to donate the house to a veteran or immigrant family or create a museum, he said.</p>
      <p>“We believe that such a crowdfunding process, where Americans (and anyone really) can say what they believe should be done with the property – by voting with their dollars – is more appropriate for a home of this nature, given its intangible value,” Haghani told Business Insider.</p>
      <p>According to the Post, a Los Angeles-based Trump critic started <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/teardowndonaldtrumpshouse">a GoFundMe fundraising page</a> in September to raise $5 million to the house and then tear it down. The page appears to have raised $0.</p>
      <p>A new auction date will be announced “when ready,” Haghani said.</p>
