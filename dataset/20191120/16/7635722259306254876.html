        <b>Portlaoise's O'Moore Park has been renamed WM Hire O'Moore Park after Laois GAA agreed a deal with their long-term sponsors MW Hire to take the naming rights on the stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Kilkenny company has been the O'Moore's shirt sponsor for the last decade and the new arrangement will also see them become title sponsors of Laois' county ground.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted that Matty Walsh MW Hire Group has agreed to extend his sponsorship to include the naming rights for O ‘Moore Park stadium," Laois chairman Peter O'Neill said of the deal.</p>
      <p>"The stadium is now one of the leading stadiums in the country after Croke Park, both for high profile games and games which get live and deferred TV coverage by RTE, SKY, TG4 and Eir Sport.</p>
      <p>"The stadium has a maximum capacity of 22,000, of which 6,500 are seated, floodlighting, to a standard for televised hurling games, now means the number of high profile games in the stadium has increased further.</p>
      <p>“This alliance will help to enhance and develop facilities in MW Hire O‘Moore Park into the future. Thanks to MW Hire Group’s sponsorship, we will be able to invest in the betterment of the association in Laois, providing a higher class of facilities and maintaining them to a proper standard at the stadium, something that every club in the county and beyond will benefit from.”</p>
