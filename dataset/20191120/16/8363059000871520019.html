      <h1>A Joker Sequel Is Happening and Now More DC Origin Stories May Be on the Way</h1>

      <p>Wanna hear a joke?</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">the Hollywood Reporter</a> this morning, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/joker-has-menaced-its-way-into-an-october-box-office-re-1838825502"><i>Joker</i>’s massive box office success</a> and the early awards season buzz for lead actor Joaquin Phoenix has led Warner Bros. to move forward with a sequel to the Batman villain origin movie. And director <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/how-joker-was-crafted-to-leave-you-speechless-1838145850">Todd Phillips</a> is almost certain to helm the project.</p>
      <p>THR also notes that Phillips was also in discussions with Warner Bros. to potentially oversee a number of different origin films using DC Comics characters. The piece says the director met with Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich after the first successful weekend over Joker and that he shot for the moon and asked for “the rights to develop a portfolio of DC characters’ origin stories.” THR says he got the rights to at least one.</p>
      <p>While there’s no word yet as to whether the studio is interested in the idea of more gritty, grounded films masquerading as superhero stories, one imagines that the studio’s seriously considering whether doing so would be in their financial interest.</p>
      <p>No specific character names were given by anyone officially, THR writes, “As for a DC villain origin story that could be mined next, Phillips would be well suited for either Darkseid, a tyrannical ruler who is worshipped by some as the god of evil, or Metropolis’ power-mad one-percenter, Lex Luthor.” Whether that was the writer’s own idea or whispered to them by someone actually interested remains to be seen.</p>
