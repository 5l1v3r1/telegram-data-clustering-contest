      <p><i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/requiem-for-a-dream">Requiem for a Dream</a></i> has emerged as the clear winner in a debate about great films people never want to see again.</p>
      <p>The conversation began on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">Twitter</a> after comedian Rose Matafeo asked: ”What is the best film that you never want to see again? Or at least for a very long time?”</p>
      <p>Darren Aronofsky’s 2000 psychological drama about drug addiction was one of the most popular picks, to the point that the words <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> began trending on the platform.</p>
      <p>“I saw <i>Requiem for a Dream</i> once and that was good enough for me!” one person wrote in response to Matafeo’s question.</p>
      <p>Another person answered: “<i>Requiem for a Dream</i>. Never – and I do mean NEVER – again.”</p>
      <p>“For me it is <i>Requiem for a Dream,</i>“ someone else wrote. “It is an incredibly powerful film on the dangers of drug use and where that can go. However, I just do not think I will be able to watch it again. It is so heavy and unflinching in the depiction. Great piece of cinema. But tough.”</p>
      <p>Set in New York City and based on the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby Jr, <i>Requiem for a Dream </i>stars <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jared-leto">Jared Leto</a>, Ellen Burstyn, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans as four people struggling with drug addiction.</p>
      <p>Burstyn was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Sara Goldfarb, a widow who gets addicted to amphetamines in an attempt to lose weight before a TV appearance.</p>
      <p>Other films that people recognised as great while having no desire to ever watch them again included <i>Room</i>, the 2015 novel adaptation that earned Brie Larson the Academy Award for Best Actress, <i>Revolutionary Road</i>, the 2008 drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, <i>The Road</i>, the 2009 adaptation of Cormac McCarthy’s novel of the same name, and Lars Von Trier’s 2000 <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>.</p>
