      <h1>The six top jobs at South Gloucestershire Council worth £900,000</h1>
      <h2>Wages bill includes salaries, fees, allowances and pensions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:59:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Flanagan</a></address>
      <p>South Gloucestershire Council forked out nearly £900,000 in wages across six job roles last year. </p>
      <p>The bill included nearly £60,000 for an agency “interim director” hired for just 17 weeks, the authority’s annual report for 2018/19 shows.</p>
      <p>The financial year to April 2019 was a year of churn for the council’s top officials, with two of the most senior officers leaving the organisation and the chief executive announcing her retirement after 14 years in the role.</p>
      <p>Altogether, the six top official roles cost the council £892,309 in pay - salaries, fees and allowances - and pension contributions.</p>
      <p>But, with three of the six top jobs each shared by at least two people across the financial year, individual senior officer pay paints a complicated picture.</p>
      <h3>Chief executive</h3>
      <p>Former chief executive Amanda Deeks received nearly £200,000 altogether, made up of £162,032 in pay and £36,295 in pension contributions.</p>
      <h3>Director of corporate resources</h3>
      <p>Dave Perry, who was Ms Deeks’s deputy and the director of corporate resources throughout 2018/19, was paid just over £130,000 and another £29,132 was put in his pension pot. Mr Perry replaced Ms Deeks as chief executive in May of this year.</p>
      <h3>Director for children, adults and health</h3>
      <p>This role was filled by two people, with the current post-holder Chris Sivers taking over in mid July 2018.</p>
      <p>Starting on a lower salary than her predecessor, who retired at the end of May, Ms Sivers received a total of £105,161 during her first eight and a half months on the job, made up of £85,916 in pay and £19,245 in pension contributions.</p>
      <h3>Director for environment and community services</h3>
      <p>Three people did this job - including an interim agency director who held the fort after one director left in June 2018, and another one started four months later.</p>
      <p>Employing a member of agency staff to plug the 17-week gap cost the council £58,468 - amounting to an additional £27,000 over and above what would have been paid during that period, a council spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Including pension payments, the former environment and community services director received nearly £46,200 in the three months before leaving, while the new director got just over £67,500.</p>
      <h3>Head of legal, governance and democratic services</h3>
      <p>John McCormack, who is still in the job, was paid £100,934 and got another £22,609 in pension contributions. </p>
      <h3>Director of public health</h3>
      <p>The role was job shared by Mark Pietroni and Sara Blackmore until January 2017, when Ms Blackmore became the main office-holder.</p>
      <p>The annual report does not name names, but shows one of them was paid £29,680 in 2018/19 while the other received just over £75,000 in pay and pension contributions.</p>
      <p>Although staggering from most people’s perspective, the total spent on the six roles was actually lower than the year before by just over £6,000.</p>
      <p>The total cost of employing council staff and officers in South Gloucestershire was £174.7million in 2018/19.</p>
