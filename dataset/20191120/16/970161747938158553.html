      <p>And many of his fans are hoping the actor will be returning to the reboot as Chuck Bass.</p>
      <p>One fan responded: ‘If chuck bass is making a comeback I’ll literally die.’</p>

      <p>The show’s co-creator Josh Schwartz recently revealed further details about the hotly anticipated series and said there would be <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/27/gossip-girl-reboot-will-be-completely-different-from-the-original-its-evolved-morphed-and-mutated-10472403/">major changes to the format of the show when it finally returns.</a></p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/07/gossip-girl-josh-schwartz-tca-1202654980/">Deadline</a>, Josh said: ‘Stephanie [Savage, co-producer] and I have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/02/01/gossip-girl-reboot-discussions-not-come-soon-enough-8423104/">been talking about it on and off for the last couple of years</a> and obviously we’ve seen more shows get revisited and there are people on social media asking for it.</p>
      <p>‘We felt that a version with just our cast grown up, regardless of the challenges of getting those actors, didn’t feel like a group of adults controlled by “gossip girl” made much sense.</p>

      <p>‘We felt there was something interesting that we are all “gossip girl” in our own way and how that’s evolved, morphed and mutated and telling that story through a new generation of Upper East Side high school kids felt right.’</p>
      <p>The new show is set eight years after the original Gossip Girl website went dark, and follows a new group of New York private school teens who will be introduced to the social surveillance of Gossip Girl.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/kristen-bell-is-returning-as-gossip-girl-for-reboot-but-what-about-the-rest-of-the-cast-11064589/">So far Kristen Bell is rumoured to be the only star from the OG Gossip Girl to return to the show</a>, whose run of six seasons ended in 201.</p>
      <p>Producers of the new installment said in a statement: ‘Kristen Bell has always been and will always be the voice of Gossip Girl.’</p>

      <p>The reboot – which will not be based on Cicely von Ziegesar’s novels either – will feature an entirely new cast of wannabe teen idols, but we’re still holding out for the self-styled queen of the Upper East Side Blair to make a fleeting cameo to fully pass on the torch.</p>

      <p>With its new reincarnation, Gossip Girl is also making the jump from network television to streaming on HBO Max. The channel has previously said that the world of Gossip Girl has ‘evolved’ with the social media boom, and the new installment will explore how social media has changed the landscape for teens today.</p>
      <p>When news of the new sequel=come-reboot was first announced this year, it was to be completely different from its parent series, having <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/27/gossip-girl-reboot-will-be-completely-different-from-the-original-its-evolved-morphed-and-mutated-10472403/">‘evolved, morphed and mutated</a>’ in the intervening years.</p>
