      <h1>Creative Alexandria dad breaks into comic book world with new series</h1>
      <h2>David Cranna has launched GlassCity Comics and is is hoping to publish his first ever comic book early next year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:57:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>He is a restaurant manager by day but in his spare time David Cranna is creating a new world at his fingertips one comic book at a time.</p>
      <p>The writer, from Alexandria, has launched GlassCity Comics and has ambitious plans to break into the comic book industry with his series.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old has an international team on board, including artists from Puerto Rico and California, to make his dream a reality.</p>
      <p>He is hoping to publish his first ever comic book early next year with plans for another 24 after that.</p>
      <p>David said: “I’ve been writing for the past seven to eight years and it’s incredible to start seeing it all come together.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>“The overall aim is to have it all completed and for the world to read.</p>
      <p>“I’m not in it for the money as there’s not much in it but I do it for the joy of it. It’s good fun.</p>
      <p>“I get to create a whole new universe with characters I have created.”</p>
      <p>David, who is dad seven-month-old son Eli with wife Lisa, got his first taste of comic books as a young lad when his dad would hand him the comic book pullout of the Sunday Post every week.</p>

      <p>Reading Oor Wullie and Beano to getting his hands on his first Judge Dredd annual was followed by the discovery of Marvel and David’s hobby grew from there.</p>
      <p>He added “I always loved reading comic books as a kid and I’ve been writing stories for the past seven to eight years.”</p>
      <p>The former Vale of Leven Academy pupil got chatting to other enthusiasts on online forum and made contact with illustrator Roman Gubskii, who lives in Puerto Rico, and Californian letterer Ryan Bielak.</p>
      <p>He went on: “It takes three people to make a comic book. You have the writer, who is me in this case, Roman who is doing the illustrations and then Ryan who is doing the lettering.</p>
      <p>“He puts the lettering on the page, so he draws the comic book’s text like the speech bubbles.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>“I write the full story, send the script to Roman and he comes back to me with the first initial sketch and then the black and white inks before the colour version.</p>
      <p>“Roman sent me five pages within a week which was incredible. He sketches them first and just to see those is amazing.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t got the first copy in my hands yet but I’m hoping that will happen in March.”</p>
      <p>The first comic book David is planning to publish is about a GlassCity detective called Gabe Gatti, whose daughter went missing five years earlier.</p>

      <p>Another girl goes missing in a case mirroring his daughter’s and he goes out in search for the answers.</p>
      <p>David said: “The whole idea of GlassCity Comics is that it is one city filled with lots of standalone stories starting from the year 2020.</p>
      <p>“It has all the usual sights that cities normally have, skyscrapers, businesses, shopping malls, pimps and drug dealers.</p>
      <p>“However, not all of it is from this world and the more you delve into its rotten core, the more you uncover its unworldly secrets.</p>
      <p>“It’s actually the most recent book I’ve written. Volume one is complete and I’m now working on volume two.</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p>“I’ll be launching a crowdfunder to fund volume two because there a lot of expenses involved, including paying the artists and the publishing costs.</p>
      <p>“Roman Gubskii has done the artwork for volume one and is staying on to finish the project. He’s a talented artist and I am incredibly lucky to be working with him. He shares the same vision of the world I am creating and his illustrations speak for themselves.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The big aim for me now is trying to create a fan base and getting the word out there.”</p>
