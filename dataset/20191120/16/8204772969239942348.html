      <p>Two aviation students at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Dublin+City+University">Dublin City University</a> (DCU)have each been awarded a €5,000 scholarship by the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Irish+Aviation+Authority">Irish Aviation Authority</a> (IAA) to cover their college fees.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Emily+Lawton">Emily Lawton</a> from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Edenderry">Edenderry</a>, Co Offaly, received her award for the BSc aviation management undergraduate programme. Avinash Kharbanda also received his reward for the postgraduate programme in aviation leadership.</p>
      <p>The IAA’s scholarship programme was developed as part of the authority’s commitment to supporting and promoting the growth and further development of aviation in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a>.</p>
      <p>It is named in honour of the late Geoffrey O’Byrne White, an accomplished aviator and a former IAA board member, who died last year.</p>
      <p>“Supporting the next generation of professionals to prosper and contribute to the aviation sector is an important part of the authority’s longer-term vision,” said IAA chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Peter+Kearney">Peter Kearney</a>.</p>
