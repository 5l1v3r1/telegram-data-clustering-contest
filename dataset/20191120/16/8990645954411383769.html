      <h1>UNO Wants to Help Keep Politics Out of Your Thanksgiving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:47:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">Johnny Thrash</a></address>
      <p>It’s inevitable – someone will attempt to steer the conversation toward politics during your Thanksgiving gathering.</p>
      <p>Mattel has the solution, though. They just rolled out <a href="https://www.mattelgames.com/en-us/uno-nonpartisan">UNO Nonpartisan</a> right in time for the holidays.</p>
      <p>They took all of the red and blue cards out of the deck and replaced them orange and purple.</p>
      <p>Realizing the absence of red and blue cards might not be enough to deter political discussion, they threw in a “veto” card you can play to skip someone’s turn as soon as they start getting political.</p>
      <p>I’m not sure if it’ll be enough to bring the lefties and right-wingers in your family to the middle on Thanksgiving, but hopefully it’ll be enough of a distraction to get you through your gathering without a knock-down-drag-out breaking out at the table.</p>
      <p>The UNO Nonpartisan Cards are only available at <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/UNO-Nonpartisan-Card-Game-for-2-10-Players-Ages-7Y/349769554">Walmart</a>, but are currently out of stock.</p>
