      <h1>Our Goosebumps Have Goosebumps From Kelly Clarkson's Stunning Brandi Carlile Cover</h1>

      <p>It's been over 10 years since Brandi Carlile released the folk-rock single "The Story," but the song <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/photo-gallery/40939905/embed/40941903/Story-Brandi-Carlile">is still drawing shivers down our spine</a> — especially when <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kelly-Clarkson">Kelly Clarkson</a> is covering it! On Nov. 19, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/The-Kelly-Clarkson-Show"><b>The Kelly Clarkson Show</b></a> host opened the episode by switching out <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kelly-clarkson-covers-uptown-funk-by-bruno-mars-video-46912225">her usual jaunty "Kellyoke" cover</a> for the emotional ballad, and the singer's powerful vocals fit the melody perfectly. From the darkened stage to Clarkson's glam dress, it feels like we're watching a concert performance rather than a daytime show! And we would <i>not</i> be mad if Clarkson decided to release her version as a track, along with <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/the-kelly-clarkson-show-music-cover-videos-46607055">the rest of her covers</a> of course. Watch the full video of the intimate performance above.</p>
