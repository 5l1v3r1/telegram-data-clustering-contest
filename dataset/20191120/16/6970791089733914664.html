      <p>New York rapper <b>A$AP Rocky</b> is gaining some unexpected and major free press. The hip-hop star’s name popped up during President <b>Donald Trump</b>‘s impeachment inquiry hearings.</p>
      <p>New <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/11/20/asap-rocky-donald-trump-impeachment-testimony-gordon-sondland">footage has emerged</a> of U.S. ambassador to the European Union <b>Gordon Sondland</b> name-dropping Rocky in reference to a summer call with Trump about the rap star’s Sweden imprisonment.</p>
      <blockquote>On Wednesday, during his public testimony, Sondland said he recalled this conversation as he was questioned by the House’s counsel. “What triggered my memory was someone’s reference to A$AP Rocky, which I believe was the primary reference of that phone call.” (The FADER)</blockquote>

      <p>Rocky’s name <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/impeachmenttoday/impeachment-today-podcast-asap-rocky-welcome">initially popped up</a> during Friday’s impeachment inquiry hearing.</p>
      <blockquote>David Holmes, the political counselor at the U.S. embassy in Ukraine, testified behind closed doors on Friday. He said that he and several others could hear Trump on the other end of a call Sondland placed during their lunch with the ambassador this summer. Holmes said he heard the president say, “So he’s going to do the investigation?” after an update from Sondland on a meeting with Zelensky. Holmes then told Congress the following, “He recommended the president should let him get sentenced, play the racism card, give him a ticker tape parade when he comes home. Ambassador Sondland further told the president that Sweden should have released him on your word, but that you can tell the Kardashians you tried.” (BuzzFeed News)</blockquote>

      <p>Trump initially went to Twitter and <a href="https://www.sohh.com/breaking-aap-rocky-released-from-jail-donald-trump-celebrates-it-was-a-rocky-week-get-home-asap-aap/">didn’t hold back</a> on letting loose on the Sweden prime minister after Rocky didn’t initially get released.</p>
