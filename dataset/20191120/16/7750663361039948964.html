      <p>Mourinho has taken over from Mauricio Pochettino at Spurs and his reign begins with a derby at the London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>And the Hammers were quick to remind Mourinho of his previous failures against them by posting a video on the social media site along with the caption “See you Saturday, Jose”.</p>
      <p>The video included a previous quote from Mourinho about West Ham’s style of play and then footage of Manchester United’s defeat in east London last season.</p>
      <p>The post was later removed from the social media platform, but nonetheless adds another sub-plot to an already intriguing battle on Saturday.</p>
      <p>All eyes will be on how Spurs line up under Mourinho, but the pressure is also firmly on Manuel Pellegrini following a run of five defeats and two draws from their last seven games.</p>
