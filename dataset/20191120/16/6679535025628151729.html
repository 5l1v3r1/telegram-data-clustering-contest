      <h1>Pink or red ball, Mohammed Shami can deliver: Wriddhiman Saha</h1>
      <h2>‘Chances are less for the ball to reverse swing, but our bowlers have the talent to get it’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:52:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Y-B-Sarangi-1158/" target="_blank">Y.B. Sarangi</a></address>
      <p>On the top of his game, India pace ace Mohammed Shami not only thrills the cricket lovers but also instils confidence in his teammates.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the first pink-ball Test in the country, to be held here between India and Bangladesh from Friday, wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha, Shami’s Bengal and India mate, said the bearded paceman — who had picked up seven wickets in the first-ever pink-ball match (between two local clubs) at the Eden Gardens in 2016 — could be devastating with any ball.</p>
      <h3>All-condition bowler</h3>
      <p>“Pink or red, I would have said the same (that he would do well). Shami has done well in recent matches. He does well in all conditions — in Ranchi (against South Africa) and the last Test (in Indore). He gets the ball to reverse swing and bowls with good pace. The ball won’t matter, he will deliver and trouble the batsman,” said Saha, prior to the home team’s first practice session at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>Amidst speculation that pacers might not extract reverse swing with the pink ball due to its extra shine, Saha backed the Indian seamers who tormented Bangladesh in the opening Test. “Chances are less for the ball to reverse swing with the pink ball, but our bowlers have the talent to get it.”</p>
      <p>Like many players and experts, Saha underlined that sighting the ball in the twilight might be challenging. “Condition-wise, twilight time will be challenging especially picking the ball. We have to adjust. (When) The ball is new, it might help pacers. It can be challenging for the batters.</p>
      <p>“If it is challenging for slips, it is so for me as well. The ball wobbles when our pacers bowl, but I have to accept the challenges,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Every international match is a challenge. We have more experience with the pink ball but with twilight period coming into play and considering the dew factor, we have to apply ourselves on the ground.”</p>
      <p>Saha said since the players were used to playing one-day and T20 matches in the evening, the new schedule for the Test would not affect their body clock.</p>
      <p>The India stumper was excited at the prospect of playing before a full house. “We are hearing tickets have been sold out for three-four days. If a Test match is played in front of a full house, the thrill is different,” said Saha.</p>
