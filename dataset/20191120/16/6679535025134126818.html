      <h1>India squads for West Indies series to be picked on Thursday</h1>
      <h2>Rohit’s workload and Dhawan’s indifferent form in focus</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:35:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Vice-captain Rohit Sharma’s workload management and opener Shikhar Dhawan’s poor form are expected to dominate the deliberations when the national selection committee meets here on Thursday to decide on India’s limited-overs squads for the home series against the West Indies.</p>
      <p>The Indian team is scheduled to play three T20Is and three ODIs against the West Indies.</p>
      <p>This is likely to be the last meeting chaired by M.S.K. Prasad as he and Central Zone selector Gagan Khoda are on their way out, having completed four years.</p>
      <p>If all goes well, Rohit may get some well-deserved rest during the three-match ODI series against the Caribbean team so that he is fresh and rejuvenated for the tough tour of New Zealand next year where India will play five T20Is, three ODIs and two Tests.</p>
      <p>Rohit’s workload will be the prominent point of discussion as he has played close to 60 competitive matches (including IPL) this year.</p>
      <p>In the current calendar year, the limited overs vice-captain has played 25 ODIs, 11 T20Is, which is three ODIs and four T20Is more than skipper Virat Kohli, who has been rested twice.</p>

      <p>While the onus will also be on Rohit to give his viewpoint, the possibility of him being given a break in at least one of the two formats looks strong.</p>
      <p>Senior opener Dhawan might feel the heat as he hasn’t been in the best of forms since he returned to cricket after sustaining an injury during the World Cup earlier this year. He may just get another go before selectors look at other options.</p>
      <p>Mayank Agarwal’s stupendous form in Test cricket and a very good List-A career average of 50-plus and an above-100 strike-rate makes him a good choice to partner K.L. Rahul in case the selectors think of looking at the third opener’s option.</p>
      <p>Rishabh Pant is likely to don the big gloves, with Sanju Samson close on his heels.</p>
      <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni has already started training and if Pant can’t seal it during the upcoming series, he might face stiff competition from the 38-year-old legend once IPL comes calling.</p>
      <p>With Hardik Pandya (stress fracture), Jasprit Bumrah (back surgery), Navdeep Saini and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (side strain) still recovering from their injuries, Shivam Dube and Shardul Thakur are expected to continue in the squad.</p>
      <p>Spin bowling allrounders — off-spinner Washington Sundar and left-arm spinner Krunal Pandya — are also under the scanner due to their underwhelming performances.</p>
      <p>India’s new T20 sensation Deepak Chahar is expected lead the pace attack but Khaleel Ahmed’s economy rate has been a problem.</p>
