      <h1>U.K. Conservative Party Scolded for Rebranding Twitter Account</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:29:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Iliana Magra</a></address>
      <p>LONDON — The governing Conservative Party in Britain was criticized by Twitter on Wednesday for “attempts to mislead people” after it temporarily changed the name of one of its accounts on the social media site to “factcheckUK.”</p>
      <p>The name change was made during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/world/boris-johnson-corbyn-election-debate.html?module=inline">first election debate</a> on Tuesday between the Conservative leader, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition Labour Party. Truth and trust were at the forefront of the debate — and have been a focal point of the campaign so far. The election is set for Dec. 12.</p>
      <p>At one point during the televised debate, the moderator, Julie Etchingham, asked, “Does the truth matter in this election?”</p>
      <p>“I think it does,” Mr. Johnson replied. The audience burst out laughing.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives’ verified account was originally named <a href="https://twitter.com/CCHQPress">CCHQPress</a>, for Conservative Campaign Headquarters.</p>
      <p>Under the new name, the account minimized references to its political allegiances, swapped out a photograph of Mr. Johnson from its cover, and used a white check mark in a magenta circle as a profile picture. It also offered what was described as a “breaking factcheck.”</p>
      <p>The account was described as “Fact checking Labour from CCHQ.”</p>
      <p>After the debate ended, the account reverted to its original name and appearance. Twitter said in a statement on Wednesday that the move had been an effort “to mislead people.”</p>
      <p>“Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information — in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate — will result in decisive corrective action,” the social media site added in an email.</p>
      <p>Twitter, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/twitter-political-ads-ban.html?module=inline">announced a ban on political ads</a> last month, said it was “committed to facilitating healthy debate” during <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/world/europe/Britain-election-Corbyn-anti-Semitism.html?module=inline">the British election campaign</a>.</p>
      <p>The debate was the first major head-to-head between Mr. Johnson and Mr. Corbyn, and a major opportunity for the rival leaders to lay out policies — not least their approach to Britain’s efforts to leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>During the debate, the renamed Conservative account posted tweets claiming to debunk Mr. Corbyn’s statements as well as <a href="https://twitter.com/CCHQPress/status/1196895054482280448?s=20">tweets commenting favorably about Mr. Johnson’s performance</a>. It framed the prime minister’s statements and his party’s claims as “facts.”</p>
      <p>The name change was noted on Twitter during the debate, and attracted widespread opprobrium.</p>
      <p>Full Fact, a fact-checking charity, said the temporary rebrand was <a href="https://twitter.com/FullFact/status/1196887778736390146?s=20">“inappropriate and misleading”</a> and urged voters not to mistake the account for an independent organization.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission in Britain said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that voters were “entitled to transparency and integrity from campaigners” before an election. The organization called on all involved to “undertake their vital role responsibly and to support campaigning transparency.”</p>
      <p>The Labour Party, in a Twitter post, called the name change “a laughable attempt to dupe those watching” the debate.</p>
      <p>Other opposition politicians were similarly indignant. “This is straight out of Donald Trump or Putin’s playbook,” Tom Brake, a member of parliament for the Liberal Democrats, said on Wednesday. “People know they can’t trust a word that Boris Johnson or the Conservatives say.”</p>
      <p>Before the 2016 referendum on whether to exit the European Union, the Leave campaign — of which Mr. Johnson was a leading figure — was accused of lies and misinformation about Britain’s prospects after any withdrawal.</p>
      <p>James Cleverly, the Conservative Party chairman, defended the renaming of the Twitter account. He said in <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCPolitics/status/1197056706498486272?s=20">a post-debate interview</a> that he was “absolutely comfortable” with the party’s digital team challenging the Labour Party’s claims.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cleverly said that the Twitter handle of the account had remained @CCHQpress and that the name clarified “the nature of the site.”</p>
      <p>Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and Conservative lawmaker, also defended the party’s actions.</p>
      <p>“We were standing up,” <a href="https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1197077941940883458">he told Sky News</a> on Wednesday. “Jeremy Corbyn could not answer the basic questions on Brexit nine times.”</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party’s social media strategy has drawn criticism before.</p>
      <p>The party <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iJ5uqdpEm0">drew scrutiny this month</a> when an altered clip was posted of a televised interview with Keir Starmer, Labour’s spokesman on Brexit, that made it appear as though Mr. Starmer had hesitated to answer a question on his party’s position on the withdrawal.</p>
      <p>But in the original live interview, Mr. Starmer had given a lengthy response to the question.</p>
