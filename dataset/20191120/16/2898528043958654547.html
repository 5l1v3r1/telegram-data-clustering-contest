      <h1>Brett Johns vs. Tony Gravely announced for UFC Raleigh</h1>

      <p>If <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3888/brett-johns">Brett Johns</a> is going to snap the first losing streak streak of his career, he’ll have to get past a debuting bantamweight on a tear.</p>
      <p>Johns will fight recent Contender Series signing Tony Gravely at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1087/ufc-fight-night-blaydes-vs-dos-santos">UFC Raleigh</a> on Jan. 25, officials <a href="https://twitter.com/UFCEurope/status/1197141291466932225">announced</a> Wednesday. This will mark Gravely’s Octagon debut.</p>
      <p>In his last two outings, Johns faced top contenders <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1534/pedro-munhoz">Pedro Munhoz</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1528/aljamain-sterling">Aljamain Sterling</a>, falling short against both by unanimous decision. This two-fight skid follows a 15-fight unbeaten stretch to start his pro career and he is 3-2 in the UFC including a 30-second calf slicer submission victory against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/989/joe-soto">Joe Soto</a> at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/907/the-ultimate-fighter-26-finale">The Ultimate Fighter 26 Finale</a> in December 2017. That marked the Welshman’s most recent win.</p>
      <p>Gravely (19-5) has won seven straight, all by way of knockout or submission. He was a bantamweight champion for Rhode Island’s Classic Entertainment &amp; Sports promotion and earned a Contender Series contract by defeating Ray Rodriguez this past August.</p>
      <p>UFC Raleigh takes place at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C. and will be headlined by a heavyweight bout between <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3622/curtis-blaydes">Curtis Blaydes</a> and former UFC champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/22/junior-dos-santos">Junior dos Santos</a>. The main card will air on the ESPN+ streaming service.</p>
