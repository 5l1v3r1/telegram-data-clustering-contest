      <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says it is time for the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine's parliament, to change and invites young people to become lawmakers.</p>
      <p>"The country should be the way you are – fresh," he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/president.gov.ua/posts/1799401576871368?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARCSVc1thMteV5KCTucM0vB7DIMB7WMUw1qucIs3dfu2NfEgKP5ymD3YwvnOKkb4cn3dNQ3gpnryYG9DPaYGvdlsFcv6LTbCv1UAkmVn1L3duAn5pCB6sSiFtSxEr4T7njLUMXzQ1KAex1-HO9A_iyJYlEIGsDYZPuiCDqiO6JiN4h4UWyiIGKLsCPV_QG9W4s4tFE2IfSb8ylFtVorUSmmuEZHpowiBi9fCIivE-7SvjghTF5sOCXlPUO1YbyenW8NhTehG_X6Ml---gid5CSfzeJmz6-dpCVUOYLUoNqbaN9n_WxXTtvNhgXErvmVZynGRS1vBtbgos9e2fj9C3xm-2A&amp;__tn__=-R">told students participating</a> in the 'Ukraine is growing with me' Forum on November 20, when speaking about the Verkhovna Rada of the current convocation.</p>
      <p>"[There should be] something new, something very interesting. Therefore, please, Dasha [Zelensky has addressed one of the students], bring people like you to the Verkhovna Rada. Don't tell anyone – but it's time to change these [Members of Parliament], too," he said, jokingly.</p>
      <p>The forum was broadcast live on the Facebook page of the Office of the President of Ukraine.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN previously reported, Zelensky considers the adoption of about 70 laws that are important to the country as the main victory of the current convocation of the Verkhovna Rada.</p>
