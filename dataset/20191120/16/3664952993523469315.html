      <h1>Quentin Lance Returns In Promo For Next Episode Of Arrow</h1>

      <p>Another episode of <i><a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/tag/arrow"><b>Arrow</b></a> </i>season 8, another welcome return of a familiar face. This time, Paul Blackthorne is returning as Quentin Lance. A regular on the series for the first six years of its run, the Star City cop ultimately sacrificed his own life for the Earth-2 doppelganger of his dead daughter when he took a bullet meant for Laurel. Now, however, he’s back as if he never died in the first place. And only Oliver Queen knows something is up.</p>
      <p>As this preview teases, episode 8×06 “Reset” sees the Emerald Archer finding himself in a slightly different alternate reality in which Quentin managed to survive his gunshot wound and is still alive in 2019. No one else thinks this is odd though, which leads our hero to suspect that this is another one of the Monitor’s cosmic tests.</p>
      <p>What’s more, “Reset” will also deal with the fallout of Team Arrow discovering that Lyla has been secretly working with the Monitor all along, which <a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/tv/arrows-audrey-marie-anderson-suits-harbinger-crisis-photo/">sets up her role as Harbinger</a> in the upcoming “<a href="https://wegotthiscovered.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>” event. Meanwhile, Quentin’s return will allow the now-redeemed Laurel to put her past regrets to bed.</p>
