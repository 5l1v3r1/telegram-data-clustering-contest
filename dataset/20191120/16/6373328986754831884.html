      <h1>Office Workers Swear Approximately 55 Times A Week, Study Finds</h1>

        <b>As much as I enjoy my job at <i>UNILAD</i> Towers, I’m admittedly more than a little guilty of muttering the occasional blue word under my breath.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As with any office-based job, frustrations will ultimately froth over like a temperamental work coffee machine. Laptop plugs disappear. Chairs lose their back support. And the internet decides Monday morning is the best time to have a funny turn.</p>
      <p>Such moments require a mini explosion of expletives, even though cursing will, of course, do nothing to get Photoshop to behave. And I’m glad to know I’m not alone.</p>

      <p>New research from <a href="https://www.4com.co.uk/blog/business-advice/offensive-language/">4com</a> indicates the average British worker hears an average of 11 swear words from their colleagues every single working day.</p>
      <p>Indeed, more than one in 10 employees (11%) have confessed to hearing more than 25 swear words at work each day. And without pointing any fingers at my own dear colleagues, this honestly doesn’t surprise me too much.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the frequency of their own bad language, one quarter (25%) of UK workers confessed to rarely reining in their tongue, with one in eight (12%) stating they never hide their coarse language in the workplace.</p>
      <p>However, there are some gallant workers among us who strive to keep things PG. One in five (19%) said they tried never to swear in the presence of their co-workers, a feat surely deserving of some sort of award.</p>

        <b>Psychotherapist and founder of The Luna Hive Dr Jo Gee told 4com:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Studies suggest swearing can be beneficial, as the process of swearing is often cathartic, letting out pent-up emotion, as well as aiding storytelling or jokes. Perceptions of those who swear are also more likely to be linked to the words ‘honest’ and ‘credible’.<br/><br/>As to why people use them at work, alongside the above reasons, for some, offensive language might be a ‘test’ for the work setting – with employees experiencing a thrill when swearing or using swear words to draw attention to themselves in a busy workplace.<br/><br/>That said, swear words often include a range of taboo words including sexual language, profanities, animal names, and vulgar terms, so this is part of why people find them offensive.<br/><br/>Additionally, they are linked to negative emotions and our minds associate them with anger, even if they’re not used aggressively.</blockquote>

      <p>Interestingly, the most frequently-cursing culprits were found to work in middle management, with more than one quarter (28%) of British workers admitting their supervisors and line managers regularly exercised their potty mouths. Second-place offenders were entry-level and admin staff, who both had 18% of votes.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the scale, catering staff were viewed to be the most polite, with just 1% of colleagues stating they regularly used foul language.</p>
      <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, interns and those on work experience were also found to be keen to exhibit their very best behaviour, with just 3% using swear words while at work.</p>
