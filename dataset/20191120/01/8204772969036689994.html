      <h2>Gardaí believe body found in burned out car in Lucan to be missing Co Dublin criminal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/conor-lally-7.1010727" target="_blank">Conor Lally</a></address>
      <p>The remains of a man who gardaí believe was shot dead in a car in Dublin were so badly burned DNA testing and dental records will be required to identify him.</p>
      <p>Detectives investigating the man’s death had last night not formally identified him, though they believe he is a criminal from Co Dublin reported missing.</p>
      <p>Gardaí and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Dublin+Fire+Brigade">Dublin Fire Brigade</a> were called to reports of a burning car at Mount <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Andrew+Rise">Andrew Rise</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Lucan">Lucan</a>, Co Dublin, at about 8.15pm on Monday.</p>
      <p>When they arrived the vehicle was engulfed in flames and as the fire was brought under control human remains could be seen in the front passenger seat.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said the vehicle, a Navy <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Toyota">Toyota</a> Corolla, registration number 05-CW-2225, was sold last Wednesday and they have appealed for anyone who may have seen it since then to contact them at Lucan Garda station.</p>
      <p>A small bunch of flowers had yesterday been laid close to the cordoned off area in the estate, which is located close to the Liffey Valley Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>Local Independent councillor Alan Hayes said Mount Andrew was a very quiet estate.</p>
      <p>“Residents are shocked that this happened in their community, literally outside of their front doors. It’s not something you’d expect to happen,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They’re also worried because they’re concerned with the darker evenings letting children out to play, people are thinking is it actually safe. It’s predominantly young families in that community. They don’t want to see this kind of thing.”</p>
      <h3>‘Disbelief’</h3>
      <p>Residents said they were “shocked and in disbelief” at the incident, describing the area as “generally quiet”.</p>
      <p>“I’m shocked, I’ve been living here a few years and there’s never been anything like this,” one young woman told The Irish Times.</p>
      <p>If the remains are those of the missing criminal from Dublin, as gardaí strongly suspect, the deceased was in his 40s and knew his life was in danger.</p>
      <p>A previous attempt had been made on his life, though he survived that gun attack despite being wounded several times.</p>
      <p>A close associate of the man was also shot dead earlier this year; David “Chen” Lynch was shot dead on March 1st on the Foxdene estate, Lucan.</p>
      <p>Gardaí suspect the murder of the man found dead in Lucan on Monday night, the earlier attempt on his life and the shooting dead of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mr+Lynch">Mr Lynch</a> are all linked to a dispute in the drugs trade.</p>
      <p>Garda sources said the body of the man found dead on Monday night was so badly burned that locum State Pathologist Dr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Heidi+Okkers">Heidi Okkers</a> was required to carry out a forensic postmortem rather than a visual one.</p>
      <h3>Family members</h3>
      <p>That involves comparing the dead man’s DNA against family members and using dental records to confirm his identity.</p>
      <p>Detectives believe the dead man got into a car with people he trusted and suspect the vehicle was driven to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Mount+Andrew+Rise">Mount Andrew Rise</a> and the victim shot there before the car was set on fire in the same location.</p>
      <p>Gardaí suspect those responsible set the car on fire with the victim’s body inside in a bid to destroy any forensic evidence that may have linked them to the crime.</p>
      <p>The remains found in the car are believed to be those of a man reported missing on Monday when his partner contacted gardaí.</p>
      <p>However, Garda sources said while they believe they know the dead man’s identity and suspect he was shot, only a postmortem, DNA and dental records would confirm that.</p>
      <p>The same sources said absolute confirmation of the man’s identity may take a number of days.</p>
