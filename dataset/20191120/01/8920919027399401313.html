Politics has been on the rise since the 2016 election. But political leanings may be more than an office irritation. Managers tend to hire people of similar ideology, and doing so could create a hiring bias, according to researchers at Texas A&amp;M. "It is becoming more common to learn and make inferences about an applicant's political ideology, particularly given information sources such as social media," said Andrew Johnson, assistant professor of management in the College of Business at Texas A&amp;M University in Corpus Christi. It's easy to separate those perceived as "different," he said. Hiring managers may not feel hiring this is wrong. There are employment discrimination protections for gender, race, religion and other characteristics. But political affiliations are not a protected class under the law.</i></p>
