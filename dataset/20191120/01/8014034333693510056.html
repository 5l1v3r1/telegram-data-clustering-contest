      <p>TOKYO — Japan has recorded a trade surplus in October, the first surplus in four months, as exports to the U.S. fell and oil prices slipped.</p>
      <p>The Finance Ministry reported Wednesday Japan’s surplus totalled 17.3 billion yen ($159 million).</p>
      <p>Exports to the U.S. dipped 11% in October, including autos and auto parts, marking the third straight month of declines.</p>
      <p>Imports from the U.S. fell 17%, such as agricultural products and gas fuels, the ministry said.</p>
      <p>Exports and imports to other regions, including Europe and China, also fell.</p>
      <p>The tariff war between the U.S. and China has taken a toll across Asia, hurting manufacturers and supply chains.</p>
      <p>A dispute between Japan and South Korea over high-tech exports has added to the uncertainty.</p>
