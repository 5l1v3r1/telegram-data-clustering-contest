      <p>“Carmelo is an established star in this league that will provide a respected presence in our locker room and a skill set at a position of need on the floor,” said Blazers president of basketball operations Neil Olshey.</p>
      <p>The Trail Blazers activated Anthony prior to Tuesday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans. Coach Terry Stotts told reporters Anthony would start at power forward and play about 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>“If he was ready to start, he was going to start,” Stotts said.</p>
      <p>Lillard was scratched due to the back soreness he has dealt with for close to a week. Lillard is just 10-for-46 shooting over the past three games.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t immediately known whether Lillard will miss more than one game. He is averaging 28.6 points and 7.1 assists in 14 games.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Anthony’s one-year, non-guaranteed contract is worth up to $2.15 million.</p>
      <p>The 10-time All-Star has not played a game in the NBA since Nov. 8, 2018 with the Houston Rockets. Houston traded him to Chicago on Jan. 22 and the Bulls waived him on Feb. 1.</p>
      <p>Anthony, 35, holds career NBA averages of 24.0 points, 6.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.02 steals in 1,064 games (1,056 starts) over 16 seasons with Denver, New York, Oklahoma City and Houston.</p>
      <p>The Blazers granted Anthony’s request to return to the league in uniform number 00 and he is expected to provide offense for Portland.</p>
