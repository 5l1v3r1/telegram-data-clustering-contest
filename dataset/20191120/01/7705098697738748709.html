      <h1>Noah Hawley is Directing the Next Star Trek Film</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:07:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:07</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>At long last, Paramount has found a suitable candidate to helm the Enterprise crew’s next interstellar adventure. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-fargo-creator-noah-hawley-direct-next-film-1256352?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">The Hollywood Reporter</a> brings word that the studio has tapped Noah Hawley to direct <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-trek-4"><b>Star Trek 4</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Hawley is best known for his work in television. He achieved mainstream success on FX when he created the <b>Fargo</b> TV series in 2014. Three years later, he followed this up with the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/x-men"><b>X-Men</b></a>-adjacent series <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/legion"><b>Legion</b></a>, which also aired on FX. Hawley made his feature directorial debut earlier this year with <b>Lucy in the Sky</b>, which he also co-wrote. He was also attached to write and direct a <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/doctor-doom"><b>Doctor Doom</b></a> standalone film for 20th Century Fox before Disney absorbed the studio’s IP.</p>

      <p>According to THR, <b>Star Trek 4</b> is expected to feature Chris Pine as James Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, and Zoe Saldana as Uhura, among others. Pine’s return is somewhat surprising. Last year, Pine and franchise co-star Chris Hemsworth reportedly opted out of the film over salary disputes. But fortunately, it sounds like these have been resolved. THR also notes that the new film is “separate” from the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-trek"><b>Star Trek</b></a> film that Quentin Tarantino is currently developing.</p>
      <p>Pine’s Captain Kirk and his crew last appeared onscreen in director Justin Lin’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-trek-beyond"><b>Star Trek Beyond</b></a>, which arrived in 2016. Like both of its predecessors, that film was a critical success. Unfortunately, it underperformed at the box office, grossing only $343.5 million against a $185 million budget.</p>
