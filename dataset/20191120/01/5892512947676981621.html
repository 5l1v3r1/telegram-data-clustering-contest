      <p>Whoever is in charge of Ultimate Fighting Championship’s (UFC) video graphics team deserves a raise. The promotion unleashed another promotional video hyping the much-anticipated UFC 245 pay-per-view (PPV) event on Dec. 14, 2019, in Las Vegas, Nevada, and it’s a feast for the eyes.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the latest promo uses cutting-edge picture, quality and graphics that pop out of the screen and grab your attention. It’s easy to see that ever since Endeavor — one of the biggest players in all of Hollywood and entertainment — came on board and acquired UFC, the production value of the promotional videos has increased.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Welterweight champion Kamaru Usman will defend his title against Colby Covington in the main event of the stacked card, while Featherweight kingpin, Max Holloway, puts his belt on the line once again, this time against Alexander Volkanovski.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the trio of championship fights will be Amanda Nunes defending her <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/weight-class/bantamweight">Bantamweight</a> strap against Germaine de Randamie, whom she already defeated six years ago. The promotion was determined to close out its PPV slate for 2019 with a bang, and this stacked card accomplishes that goal.</p>
