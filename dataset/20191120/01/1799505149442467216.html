      <p>(CN) – Former Vice President Joe Biden holds a double-digit lead over his 2020 Democratic rivals in Arizona, though it is mainly concentrated within Arizona’s most populated counties, according to polling data released Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://ohpredictive.com/press-releases/democratic-primary-2020/">OH Predictive Insights poll</a> shows Biden, which most surveys put as the front-runner in the Democratic primary contest for president, continues to lead in Arizona with 29% support among primary voters. This gives Biden a sizeable 11-point advantage over his closest rival, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who currently sits at 18%. Rounding out the top three for Arizona Democrats is Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with 16%.</p>
      <p>No other candidate within the Democratic field cracked 10% support.</p>
      <p>Mike Noble, chief of research and a managing partner of Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights, said the numbers the Democratic race for president is narrowing to three leading candidates.</p>
      <p>“Despite the historically large Democratic primary field, it’s actually a three-way race in Arizona with Joe Biden showing strongest support among many demographic groups,” Noble said with the release of the poll.</p>
      <p>Biden’s current lead in the Grand Canyon State is also notably larger than in previous polls. An Emerson Polling questionnaire conducted in late October had Biden at 28% support among Arizona voters, while Warren and Sanders were tied at 21% each. This suggests the 7-point advantage Biden enjoyed at the time has now widened even further as Biden’s numbers inch upward and Warren and Sanders slip.</p>
      <p>A breakdown of Biden’s support by county finds that while Biden holds an advantage across Arizona overall, most of his support comes from the state’s two largest counties.</p>
      <p>In Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populated, Biden lead with a sizeable 32% – well ahead of Warren and Sanders at 17% and 13%, respectively.</p>
      <p>In Arizona’s second-most populated county Pima, Biden ties with Sanders at 27% support.  Warren holds on to second in Pima County with 13%.</p>
      <p>Among the rest of Arizona’s counties, Biden manages third place. Warren, continuing a trend of typically polling better in smaller urban communities, leads in the state’s 15 smaller counties with 24%, ahead of Sanders (20%) and Biden (19%).</p>
      <p>Within all of Arizona’s counties, however, at least 20% of voters continue to support an “other” candidate.</p>
      <p>Biden and Sanders command sizeable support from Hispanic voters in the state, each holding roughly a third (31%) of Hispanic voter support. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro, the only Latino still in the race for president, takes a distant third with only 8% Hispanic support in the state. Warren rounds out the top four with at just 5%.</p>
      <p>A breakdown in educational background among Arizona voters also show that each candidate is drawing support from entirely separate voting groups.</p>
      <p>Biden enjoys 31% support among voters without a college degree, leading the field by double-digits compared to Sanders (18%) and Warren (10%).</p>
      <p>Biden also leads with voters who have a college degree, though the lead has shrunk to single digits. Biden enjoys 27% from college-educated voters, followed by Sanders at 23% and Warren at 21%.</p>
      <p>Warren only just overtakes Biden among voters with a post-graduate degree, 29% to 26%. Sanders enjoys support from just 7% of that group.</p>
      <p>The poll surveyed 900 registered voters, including 260 likely primary voters, and has a margin of error of 6.08 points.</p>
