      <p>If you happen to be walking around San Francisco, California and think you see a pair of <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/06/airpods-pro-review/">AirPods</a> lying on the ground, you likely aren’t as lucky as you think.</p>

      <p>Pablo Rochat, a San Francisco, California-based artist, recently put together a rather amusing AirPods prank over the weekend. As first reported by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airpods-stickers-prank-san-francisco-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T"><i>Business Insider</i></a>, Rochat printed out dozens of AirPod sized, life-like stickers and stuck them on the ground all over the city.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>Business Insider</i>, Rochat said that the prank aimed to catch people’s attention cause them to do a double-take.</p>
      <p>“Most people found it funny, but a few people were pissed that they got pranked,” Rochat said in the interview.</p>

      <p>To keep things authentic, the prankster printed out both AirPods and AirPods Pro stickers.</p>
