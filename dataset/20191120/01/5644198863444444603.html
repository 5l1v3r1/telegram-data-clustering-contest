      <p>LONDON: A British university on Tuesday (Nov 19) said it was reviewing its links with Prince Andrew after he defended his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a TV interview.</p>
      <p>But a bank said it would not be renewing its backing for a project he founded.</p>

      <p>"We will be reviewing the position of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, as our patron at the next board of governors meeting on Tuesday 26th November," said London Metropolitan University.</p>
      <p>"The university opposes all forms of discrimination of discrimination, abuse, human trafficking and any activity that is contrary to the university's values."</p>
      <p>Andrew - Queen Elizabeth II's second son - took over the role from his father, Prince Philip, in 2013. There have been royal patrons at the institution since 1848.</p>
      <p>The review comes after the BBC broadcast a lengthy interview with the prince on Saturday in which he tried to explain his links to Epstein, who was found dead in jail in August.</p>

      <p>Andrew strongly denied claims he had had sex with a 17-year-old girl allegedly trafficked by Epstein but expressed little regret about his friendship with the disgraced financier.</p>

      <p>The unprecedented subject matter tackled in the television interview - and the royal's apparent lack of empathy for victims - has dominated British media in recent days.</p>
      <p>It has also put pressure on those with links to the prince.</p>
      <p>Students at Huddersfield University in northern England said they wanted Andrew to resign as a patron, claiming he was "an utterly unsuitable representative" because of the allegations.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered bank meanwhile said it was not renewing its sponsorship of the prince's Pitch@Palace project, which encourages entrepreneurs and start-ups around the world.</p>
      <p>The bank cited "commercial reasons" for not renewing the current agreement when it expires in December.</p>
      <p>Accountancy firm KPMG's backing for the mentoring scheme expired at the end of last month and will not be renewed.</p>
      <p>Pharma giant AstraZeneca's partnership is due up next month. It is also being reviewed.</p>
      <p>Insurance giant AON reportedly asked for its logo to be removed from the Pitch@Palace website, according to the Financial Times.</p>
