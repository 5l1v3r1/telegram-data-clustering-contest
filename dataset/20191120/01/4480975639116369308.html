      <h1>USD/JPY consolidates in below 200-DMA</h1>

          <b>Trade and Brexit keep markets on edge, Yen consolidates on lower US dollar and yields. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Hong Kong thrown into the mix dampening positive trade deal prospects. </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>USD/JPY is currently trading at 108.54 within a range of 108.38/57 in Asia, supported on the 50-day moving average (DMA) with bullish attempts capped by the 200-DMA. Trade wars and Brexit remain the key themes, although there has been a lack of fundamental developments in those respects and markets are moving into a phase of consolidation as investors insist on further catalysts before making a move. </p>
      <p>The start of the week's news from CNBC whereby Chinese officials require scaling back in tariffs is keeping investor son high alert and underpinning the risk-off profile in markets. The latest developments come with the US Senate which has approved the Hong Kong human rights bill and is sending it to the House of Representatives. </p>
      <h3>Brexit TV debate conclusions were mixed in the polls</h3>
      <p>Elsewhere, Brexit was a focus with the first f a series of Live TV debates hosted by ITV at the start of the Asian session. The debate concluded with mixed polls. A snap ITV Twitter poll put Corbyn in the lead by a huge percentage as follows (there were 29,665 votes):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>78% Jermy Corbyn won.</li>
        <li>22% said Johnson won.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Meanwhile, and to the contrary, a YouGov / Sky News snap chat Poll arrived as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Johnson 51%</li>
        <li>Corbyn 49%</li>
        <li>Excluding don’t knows</li>
        <li>Just over 1,600 respondents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Indeed, major polls have the Tory party in with a double-digit lead which is supportive of a risk-on climate considering Johnson seems to have a majority of the Tory party backing his deal. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fedspeak came with New York Federal Reserve president Williams who said that the economy is in a “good place”. With respect to yields, the US 2-year treasury yields roundtripped between 1.59% to 1.62% while the 10-years initially climbed from 1.80% to 1.83% but were then sent back to 1.78%. </p>
      <h4>USD/JPY levels</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/usd-jpy-forecast-turns-focus-to-the-downside-but-lacks-momentum-201911192024"><b>Valeria Bednarik</b></a>, the Chief Analyst at <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news">FXStreet</a>, notes that the USD/JPY pair consolidates below the 20- and the 200-day SMAs, having hit a daily low of 108.45:</p>
      <blockquote>"The technical picture has turned slightly bearish according to the 4-hour <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a>, with <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> crossing into negative ground although lacking bearish strength. Immediate support is seen at 108.44, 200-period SMA in 4-hour chart, followed by 108.23, last week’s low. However, only a break below 107.70, 100-day SMA, could tilt the longer-term bias to the downside."</blockquote>
