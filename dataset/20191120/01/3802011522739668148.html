      <p>The juvenile pleaded guilty to an assault charge before Western Commonage magistrate, Mr Stephen Ndlovu.</p>
      <p>He was remanded out of custody on free bail to December 2 for continuation of trial.</p>
      <p>The boy said he stabbed his neighbour with a screwdriver. “I do admit to the charges levelled against me, but I didn’t use an Okapi knife your worship, I used a screwdriver,” he said.</p>
      <p>For the State, Mr Stewart Madzore said the accused person allegedly committed the offence on October 20 this year.</p>
      <p>“The accused person unlawfully stabbed the complainant three times on his back using an Okapi knife after they had a misunderstanding,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Madzore said the victim was rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital after he sustained deep cuts on his back.</p>
      <p>The complainant said the accused person was in the habit of bullying him.</p>
      <p>“The accused person said I should give him money which he claimed to be a protection fee in the neighbourhood. I told him that I’m only a student and I don’t have money and he got angry. After sometime in October, the accused person, who was in company of his friends ambushed and stabbed me on my back. I screamed for help and I was rushed to hospital as blood was gushing out from the wounds,” he said.</p>
      <p>The matter was reported to police leading to the bully’s arrest.<a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/bully-16-stabs-boy-thrice-over-protection-fee/"><b> The Chronicle</b></a></p>
