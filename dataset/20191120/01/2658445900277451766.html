      <h4>Gbade Ogunwale, Abuja</h4>
      <p>Members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) appear to be divided over the suspension of its Minority Leader in the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, and six others.</p>
      <p>The NWC, in a recent statement by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, had insisted that the suspension of Eleumelu and others was still subsisting.</p>
      <p>The party on July 11, slammed one month suspension on Elumelu and others for taking House Minority leadership positions against the choices of the party.</p>
      <p>Besides Elumelu, others affected by the suspension order are: Lynda Ikpeazu, Wole Oke, Anayo Edwin, Gideon Gwadi, Toby Okechukwu and Adekoya Abdul-Majid.</p>

      <p>The party’s NWC has refused to recognise Elumelu and other suspended lawmakers as minority leaders in the lower chamber.</p>
      <p>The party has insisted on Kingsley Chinda as Minority Leader.</p>
      <p>But two members of the NWC have said the suspension order on Elumelu and others had expired.</p>
      <p>Deputy National Chairman (South) Elder Yemi Akinwonmi and the National Youth Leader Sunday Udeh Okoye debunked reports of extending the suspension on the House of Representatives members.</p>
      <p>According to them, such extension was not discussed at any of the NWC meetings after the members were suspended in July.</p>
      <p>In separate interviews with reporters in Abuja yesterday, the two party officials said they were unaware of any suspension.</p>
      <p>“I am not aware of the extension of the suspension. I am not aware. I do not remember any occasion where it was elongated.</p>
      <p>“I am only aware that he (Elumelu) was suspended for only one month. After that, I am not aware of any further action.</p>
      <p>“I am an integral part of the NWC but I am telling you that to the best of my knowledge, I am aware that he was suspended for one month and that was about six months ago and the suspension has elapsed,” Akinwonmi said.</p>
      <p>Also, Okoye denied any knowledge of extension on the suspension order on the lawmakers.</p>
