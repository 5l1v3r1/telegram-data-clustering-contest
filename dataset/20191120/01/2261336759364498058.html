      <h1>Ex-coach Cesar Gracie says Nick Diaz would crush Jorge Masvidal: He is the real ‘BMF’ champ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>After almost five years away from the sport, former Strikeforce welterweight champion Nick Diaz is back in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>All it took was a long-winded interview with Ariel Helwani and a few digs at newly-crowned ‘BMF’ champ Jorge Masvidal and, just like that, the eldest Diaz brother is back in hot demand.</p>
      <p>Die hard Diaz fans want to see Nick avenge younger brother Nate Diaz, who was beaten to a pulp by Masvidal in the UFC 244 main event earlier this month at Madison Square Garden.</p>
      <p>Nick’s former coach and mentor, Cesar Gracie, thinks it would be the perfect matchup for Diaz and a chance for the quasi-retired star to introduce himself to a new generation of MMA fans.</p>
      <p>“That is his belt. The BMF belt, Nick is the BMF, if you will. That’s the perfect belt for Nick,” Gracie said during a recent interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppuH_4RC_oI"><b>Ariel Helwani’s MMA Show</b></a><b> </b>(h/t <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/18/20971169/ex-coach-real-bmf-nick-diaz-crushes-guys-like-jorge-masvidal-mma">MMA Mania</a>). ”The hype on something like that would be so huge to fight a guy like that. You got to get fighters that are doing something now.”</p>
      <p>“The Masvidal fight with Nate, I watched it and I thought, ‘okay, this guy has really good hands.’ He is a tough fighter,” Gracie added. “But I think Nick at his best, I don’t know how he would do, he’d have to be in shape. But the Nick Diaz I’ve seen at his best or anywhere near it, he crushes guys like that.</p>
      <p>“I think it would be great for the fans who don’t know who Nick Diaz is. And let’s face it, there are a lot of new fans in the sport and Nick has been out for a long time. he fans who don’t know who Nick Diaz is, that would be a great showcase for him to come back.”</p>
      <p>Although Masvidal will be keeping a close eye on the upcoming welterweight title bout between Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington at UFC 245, ‘Gamebred’ said it would be an ‘honor’ to fight Nick Diaz.</p>
      <p>Diaz, 36, last fought almost five years ago at UFC 183, where he dropped a unanimous decision to Anderson Silva (later overturned to a NC after Silva tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs) in the main event at Las Vegas’ T-Mobile Arena. Diaz also tested positive for marijuana metabolites and was suspended for 18 months.</p>
