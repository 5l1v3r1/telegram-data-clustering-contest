        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): The case against the former military chief and president was filed by the previous Pakistan Muslim League–Nawaz (PML-N) government in late 2013 for subverting the Pakistan Constitution and imposing a state of emergency on 3 November, 2007.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A special court in Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad on Tuesday reserved its verdict in a treason case filed against the country's former president and now retired army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, media reports said.</p>
      <p>The decision to <a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2102304/1-musharraf-treason-case-special-court-announce-verdict-nov-28/">reserve the verdict against Musharraf was taken by a three-judge bench of a special court</a>. Led by Justice Waqar Ahmed Seth, the bench said it will deliver its verdict on 28 November.</p>
      <p>Musharraf seized power from then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif through a military coup on 12 October, 1999, when the latter was reportedly about to sack him from the post of the army chief.</p>
      <p>Musharraf led a military-dominated government as army chief till 2007. He nominated himself as Pakistan’s 10th president on 20 June, 2001, and secured himself in that position till 18 August, 2008, through a controversial referendum held on 1 May, 2002.</p>
      <p>He was forced out of office when threatened with impeachment, living in a self-imposed exile until 2013.</p>
      <p>Musharraf became <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201611281047938701-arrest-pakistan-court-ex-president/">Pakistan’s first army chief and president to be charged with treason</a> on 31 March, 2014, for imposing a state of emergency on 3 November, 2007, in a bid to end challenges to his rule by a hostile judiciary, Islamist militants and political rivals.</p>
      <p>He pleaded <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201808291067566063-pakistan-interpol-musharraf/">not guilty to five charges and dismissed them as being politically motivated</a>. The trial, however, could not be concluded over the past six years for several reasons.</p>
      <p>After escaping Pakistan in March 2016, the former army chief has been purportedly undergoing medical treatment in Dubai.</p>
