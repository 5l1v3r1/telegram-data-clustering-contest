      <h1>Vegan Sues Burger King for 'Contaminated' Impossible Whoppers</h1>
      <h2>Phillip Williams is taking the national fast food chain Burger King to court for cooking their new meatless sandwich on a shared grill with actual meat.</h2>

      <p>The Georgia man is working on a class action lawsuit against Burger King for himself and “similarly situated individuals,” who <a href="https://company.bk.com/menu-item/impossible-whopper">consumed</a> the supposedly vegan-friendly burgers after they were cooked on the same grill as the regular ones — “covering the outside of the Impossible Whopper’s meat-free patties with meat by-product.”</p>
      <p>Despite its target demographic, Burger King states on its official website that the sandwich also contains non-vegan mayonnaise. Should a customer desire a truly vegan meal, the company suggests they specify that their burger be prepared with a “non-broiler method.”</p>
      <p>Williams contends that the information was not clearly posted at the location he visited and that he was led to believe the sandwich — ordered without the aforementioned mayo — would be truly meat-free. Burger King, as expected, has refused to “comment on pending litigation.”</p>
      <p>Lawyering aside, the “Impossible Whopper” has been a massive success for the franchise. Parent company Restaurant Brands International (RBI) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burger-king-sued-by-vegans-for-alleged-impossible-whopper-contamination/">called</a> it a “huge hit.” RBI CEO José Cil reported a half-billion improvement over last year’s performance, with the “0% beef” patties driving as much as five percent of their sales growth.</p>
