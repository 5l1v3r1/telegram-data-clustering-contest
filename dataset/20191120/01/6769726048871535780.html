      <p>CONSTRUCTION of the $80 million Lakelands Station will start in 2021.</p>
      <p>Today Premier Mark McGowan announced the Federal Government has agreed to fund 80 per cent of Lakelands Station construction.</p>
      <p>The new funding arrangement between the State and Federal governments means Lakelands will be the next METRONET station built on the Mandurah Line.</p>
      <p>Lakelands Station will take pressure off Mandurah Station, and reduce travel distances for local residents to access the rail line. The existing Mandurah and Warnbro stations are 23km apart, with Lakelands to be built between them (north of Mandurah Station).</p>
      <p>Initial modelling predicts the new station, to be built with access off Lake Valley Drive, will have 2,300 daily boardings when the station opens in 2023, increasing to 3500 in 2031.</p>
      <p>It will be built on land specially set aside during construction of the Mandurah Line and will include platforms and rail infrastructure over the existing lines, park and ride, kiss and ride and disability parking bays, a bus interchange and lockable cycling storage.</p>
      <p>The Federal Government had previously made a number of smaller funding commitments to Lakelands Station that still fell short of 50 per cent of the funds required to build the project.</p>
      <p>Mr McGowan said the State Government remained committed to building a new station at Karnup, with a full business case for the station and surrounding residential development to continue.</p>
      <p>Initial planning shows that some private land and residential property acquisitions will be required to build Lakelands Station. Further detail on acquisitions will be finalised as detailed planning progresses.</p>
      <p>Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said Lakelands Station will be a good addition to the Mandurah Line and METRONET, making it easier for more people to access public transport.</p>
      <p>“This railway line goes past the doorsteps of many residents of the City of Mandurah’s northern suburbs, but it’s not always convenient for them to access a train station.</p>
      <p>“Through METRONET we are building new infrastructure – such as this new station and the new multistorey car park at Mandurah Station – that makes public transport a more desirable travel option.</p>
      <p>“Leveraging the significant Federal Government funding commitment to build a station at Lakelands provides the best value for money for the taxpayer.”</p>
      <p>Mandurah MLA David Templeman said he had worked hard to be heard and to call on the Federal Government to deliver a fair share for the construction of Lakelands Station.</p>
      <p>“I am proud we have been successful and we can now work towards getting the project to its construction phase in early 2021.</p>
      <p>“Passenger numbers on the Mandurah Line continue to grow and the new train station, along with Mandurah Station’s multistorey car park, will help make the most of the Labor-built train line.”</p>
