      <h1>Global DRAM revenues increase 4% in 3Q19, says DRAMeXchange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:42:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:42</time> by <a rel="author">Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>Sales in the global DRAM market grew 4.1% sequentially to US$15.45 billion in the third quarter of 2019, following three quarters of sequential drops, according to DRAMeXchange.</p>
      <p>DRAM suppliers saw their combined bit sales ramp up rapidly in the third quarter, DRAMeXchange indicated.</p>
      <p>"Demand-side inventory in 2H19 has returned to relatively healthy levels," said DRAMeXchange. "Furthermore, some vendors pulled their quarterly product shipment forward in an effort to avoid potential negative impacts from Trump's impending tariffs."</p>
      <p>Looking into the fourth quarter, DRAM makers are expected to see their shipments climb further thanks to growing demand for servers and smartphones, DRAMeXchange noted.</p>
      <p>DRAM market leader Samsung posted sequential increases of 30% and 5%, respectively, in bit sales and revenues during the third quarter, while SK Hynix saw its bit sales increase 20% on quarter with a 3.5% rise in revenues. Samsung grabbed a 46.1% share of the global DRAM market in the third quarter, followed by SK Hynix with a 28.6% share, according to DRAMeXchange.</p>
      <p>"In spite of positive movements in shipment numbers, DRAM suppliers saw diminished operating profit margins due to a 20% industry-wide decline in ASP," DRAMeXchange continued. Samsung's operating profit margin fell to 33% in the third quarter from 41% in the second, while SK Hynix' slipped by a smaller 4pp on quarter to 24%.</p>
