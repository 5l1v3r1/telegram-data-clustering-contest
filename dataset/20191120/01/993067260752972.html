      <p>A prominent Northern Ireland mental health expert has received a lifetime achievement award.</p>
      <p>Professor Roy McClelland was honoured at the Royal College of Psychiatrists annual awards ceremony in London.</p>
      <p>As Professor of Mental Health at Queen's University School of Medicine, he was responsible for undergraduate teaching in psychiatry and was greatly involved in postgraduate psychiatry training.</p>
      <p>A consultant psychiatrist at Belfast City Hospital, he also co-chaired the Bamford Review which has helped modernise mental health services in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>After the Good Friday Agreement, he was involved in two major civil society ventures.</p>
      <p>He chaired the Healing Through Remembering initiative, addressing the legacy of individual and communal trauma around the Troubles, and was also a trustee of the Northern Ireland Centre for Trauma and Transformation, which provided psychotherapy for victims of the Omagh bombing.</p>
      <p>Internationally, he was responsible for the development of European Standards in Confidentiality for which he was awarded the Geneva Prize for Human Rights in Psychiatry.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the award, Professor McClelland said: "I have had a very privileged career, during which time I have met, and worked with many wonderful people.</p>
      <p>"It has been a very fulfilling and rewarding journey. I would like to thank the Royal College for this award, I count it a great honour to receive such a prestigious accolade from my colleagues".</p>
      <p>Prof Wendy Burn, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: â€œThe RCPsych Awards are all about recognising and rewarding contributions to the mental health sector, but the Lifetime Achievement Award is a cut above the rest.</p>
      <p>"I am so pleased that we're able to publicly honour Professor McClelland for improving the lives of people living with mental illness in Northern Ireland."</p>
