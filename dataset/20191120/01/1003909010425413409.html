      <h1>Braid: Fired election investigator says wrongdoers must be punished</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:42:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:42</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Lorne Gibson, the fired election commissioner, stuck it straight to the UCP government in his first public statement since he was <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/3pm-ish-embargo-government-bill-to-fire-alberta-elections-commissioner-roll-office-into-chief-electoral-officer/wcm/07429695-ad8a-492c-9f6a-330ecc2f64c7">fired Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>While saying he can’t be specific about details, Gibson defended his <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/alberta-government-firing-election-commissioner-who-was-investigating-leadership/wcm/c896bfd3-c7bd-4f49-882c-03cf89f95653">hot pursuit and big fines</a> for people who violated funding laws during the UCP leadership campaign.</p>
      <p>“Participants who seek to violate or take unfair advantage of those rules must be held accountable for actions that cross legal and ethical lines,” Gibson said in a written statement.</p>
      <p>“After thorough and fair investigations, they must be subject to penalties appropriate to the nature of the offense.</p>
      <p>“Fairness requires that offenders pay a price for their wrongdoing, including negative publicity.</p>
      <p>“Effective enforcement serves as a deterrent to others contemplating illegal activities and prevents the emergence of a culture of corruption within the political and electoral process.”</p>
      <p>That’s exactly what Gibson did for a remarkable year.</p>
      <p>He levied $210,000 in fines to people who evaded and ignored fundraising laws, mostly in the leadership race for the party that won the election.</p>
      <p>Now, Gibson and his entire staff will be terminated, and the function rolled into Elections Alberta.</p>
      <p>The UCP argues that this is just one of many cost-saving measures.</p>
      <p>We might swallow that — if only they weren’t firing the guy who’s investigating them.</p>
      <p>The Opposition NDP responded with a pair of rare gestures that went beyond the usual grandstanding. For once, they were entirely justified.</p>

      <p>Notley asked the lieutenant-governor to “deny assent of Bill 22” on grounds that it’s an abuse of power.</p>
      <p>That’s as unlikely as getting the Queen to comment on Prince Andrew. But it made a serious point.</p>
      <p>In the legislature, Notley said: “This premier’s decision to fire the election commissioner, someone who’s actively investigating the UCP fraud, is an attack on democracy, a coverup of the truth and could even constitute an obstruction of justice.”</p>
      <p>Premier Jason Kenney didn’t have a response. He’s conveniently in Houston for the week.</p>
      <p>Later, Notley got herself <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/notley-kicked-out-of-alberta-legislature-for-comment-on-election-watchdog-firing/wcm/ea263b2b-71ea-41c8-a4d2-45e94b0c69ff">kicked out for the day</a> by Speaker Nathan Cooper after she refused to apologize for saying government house leader Jason Nixon misled the house.</p>
      <p>That’s a banned phrase since it suggests a politician might, gosh, lie.</p>
      <p>Notley said Bill 22 “is a far bigger threat to this house than whether or not I said people over there misled the house.”</p>
      <p>At that point, Cooper expelled her.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t clear what Gibson had in store next. But if anybody has an idea, it must be people in the UCP. It was their leadership contest, after all.</p>
      <p>Only this month, Gibson issued more big fines.</p>
      <p>There’s also <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/crown-confirms-special-prosecutor-in-ucp-investigation/wcm/a8bf0816-39ad-4857-8dd5-6dbefb77c06e">an RCMP investigation going on</a>, remember?</p>

      <p>In May, after the Mounties visited Justice Minister Doug Schweitzer, the prosecution service (not the minister) asked for an outside prosecutor from Ontario.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of pressure building up in this boiler.</p>
      <p>The UCP claims the investigation can continue and all fines will stand. The chief electoral officer “may” (not will) hire Gibson to do the same job under the new order.</p>
      <p>If that happens, and Gibson continues investigating as before, I will be the first to admit the skepticism was misplaced.</p>
      <p>But Gibson’s office is right now in turmoil as people ponder their futures.</p>
      <p>Even if the service is reborn under Elections Alberta, with many of the same cast, work will be delayed for months.</p>
      <p>If Gibson isn’t rehired by Elections Alberta, he gets six months’ severance.</p>
      <p>And he isn’t allowed to sue.</p>
      <p>He professes surprise and disappointment at being canned. But the most alarming part of his statement comes at the end.</p>
      <p>His office has now received more than 800 complaints, he says.</p>
      <p>Investigators try hard to keep up but “not all of these complaints and allegations have been dealt with.”</p>
      <p>Really now.</p>
