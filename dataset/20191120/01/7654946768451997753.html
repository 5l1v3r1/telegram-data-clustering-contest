      <h1>Devin Nunes spars with Adam Schiff, calls impeachment probe a ‘drug deal’</h1>

      <p>GOP House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Devin Nunes slammed the House Democrats’ impeachment probe, referring to the proceedings as a “drug deal” at Tuesday’s public hearings.</p>
      <p>The remarks, which came during the day’s second round of testimony, were directed at the chair of his committee, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff.</p>
      <p>Nunes had been deriding the Democrats for using “magical 15 minute motions” to continue their questioning of Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, and former National Security Council Russia expert Tim Morrison.</p>
      <p>Schiff responded that under a House resolution that outlines the impeachment proceeding procedures, the Democrats “can have successive rounds of up to 45 minutes” to question witnesses.</p>
      <p>“I would say that you can go four hours, we can go five hours, we’ll give you all you want,” replied Nunes. “You can keep digging if you want. The deeper the hole you dig, I think the more viewers will turn off.</p>
      <p>“Because people just aren’t buying the drug deal that you are trying to sell.”</p>
      <p>The comments by Nunes are reminiscent of remarks reportedly made by former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who allegedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/15/ex-white-house-official-testifies-about-admins-shadow-foreign-policy-boltons-concerns-report/">referred to attempts by President Trump’s allies</a> to pressure Ukraine into investigating the president’s political foes as a “drug deal.”</p>
      <p>“I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” Bolton allegedly told Fiona Hill, an impeachment probe witness who served as the National Security Council’s senior official for Russia and Europe, to relay to a White House lawyer.</p>
