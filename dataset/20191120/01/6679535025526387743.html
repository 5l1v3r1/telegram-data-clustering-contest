      <p>Chitrakatha 2019, the first international design festival hosted by the National Institute of Design, Andhra Pradesh, got off to a colourful start on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Experts from various walks of life are at the transit campus of the design school to share their experiences with budding designers during the five-day festival.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the Governing Council of NID-A.P., Udayant Malhoutra, said he was impressed by the extraordinary efforts put in by the management, staff and students to transform the place into a lively zone.</p>
      <p>“We have built a number of new national institutions. This one, however, has been the most challenging in terms of infrastructure,” Mr. Malhoutra said. Mr. Malhoutra is CEO and Managing Director of Dynamatics Technologies Ltd. which had bagged several awards for its precision engineering over the years.</p>
      <p>Talking about design thinking, he narrated his experiences to the students and elaborated how, as a 20-year-old, he transformed his small company, which used to make hydraulic pumps, into a key global supplier that now provides complex mechanical parts to aerospace giants such as Boeing, Airbus and Bell Helicopter.</p>
      <p>Nigel Hughes, an Earth scientist, said Chitrakatha represented an incredible talent and job platform. Mr. Hughes spoke about his association with Rabindranath Tagore’s Santiniketan, and how it was a symbol of the extraordinary richness of India’s cultural diversity.</p>
      <p>“The idea of sharing the story of India’s history in new and novel ways in the spirit of experimentation and joy that Rabindranath himself excelled is in itself an elation,” he said, complimenting the students on the campus for their involvement in their work.</p>
      <p>Bina Rao, Head of the Design Department and CEO, Creative Bee, Hyderabad, said when she first saw the building, she wondered how it could be made to look like a design school. “I am delighted to see that this place has come alive,” she said amidst applause.</p>
