      <h4>Add handstands to Olivia Munn’s long list of athletic abilities! The sword-wielding actress revealed her toned legs while nailing a difficult handstand by the pool.</h4>
      <p>Saving the world, fighting aliens, and now, doing handstands — what can’t <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/olivia-munn/"><b>Olivia Munn</b></a> do? The 39-year-old actress, known for her roles in <i>X-Men: Apocalypse </i>and <i>The Predator</i>, showed off her anti-gravity trick by standing completely vertical on her hands by a hotel pool. Given the seaside location of the stunt, Olivia rocked striped mini short shorts, which showed off her toned and strong legs! The actress shared a photo of her yoga pose to Instagram on Nov. 19, along with a video of her pal <b>Karine Lemieux</b> pulling off a handstand herself.</p>
      <p>“Whether it’s doing martial arts together or yoga or just handstands by the pool, it’s always a good time w @karine_lmx 🌠,” Olivia captioned the Instagram post. Like Olivia, Karine also worked on an <i>X-Men </i>movie — she provided stunts for <i>Dark Phoenix</i>, which starred <b>Sophie Turner</b>! Olivia u are awesome👏!</p>
      <p>While fans raved over Olivia’s skills and physique, she faced a much more negative reaction after sharing another photo that revealed her thighs on Aug. 13. The picture revealed subtle cellulite — something every woman has — and Olivia <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/08/14/olivia-munn-reacts-cellulite-diss-cottage-cheese-comment/">clapped back</a> at her body-shamers. “What woman doesn’t have cellulite?? It’s not gonna stop me from posting a pic,” Olivia wrote in response to one fan who wrote that the actress makes cellulite look “amazing.”</p>

      <p>Just two weeks before showing off her prowess at handstands, Olivia <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/04/olivia-munn-tucker-roberts-dating-relationship-debut-halloween-2019/">showed off her boyfriend</a>, Philadelphia Fusion president <b>Tucker Roberts</b>, to her 2.4 million Instagram followers. She shared a photo of their matching costumes inspired by the characters Jesse and Judy Gemstone from the HBO comedy series <i>The Righteous Gemstones</i>, and the Nov. 3 post also served as their public debut as a couple!</p>
