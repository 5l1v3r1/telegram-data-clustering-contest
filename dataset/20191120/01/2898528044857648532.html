      <h1>Francisco Trinaldo suggests UFC Brasilia fight with Edson Barboza</h1>

      <p>SAO PAULO, Brazil — <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1819/francisco-trinaldo">Francisco Trinaldo</a> already has a name in mind for his next bout in the Octagon after scoring a close decision win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1095/bobby-green">Bobby Green</a> at Saturday night’s <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1055/ufc-fight-night-sao-paulo">UFC Sao Paulo</a> show.</p>
      <p>With the promotion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/14/20964931/ufc-return-brazil-march-2020-mma">set to return to Brasilia on March 14</a>, a city where “Massaranduba” lived at for years early in his MMA career, the Brazilian lightweight issued a respectful callout to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/56/edson-barboza">Edson Barboza</a>.</p>
      <p>“I have nothing against Barboza, he’s the best Muay Thai fighter in Brazil in my opinion, but, f*ck, imagine Barboza and I putting on a great fight in Brasilia?” Trinaldo said in his post-fight media scrum in Sao Paulo. “We’re both Brazilians and I think fans would love that.</p>
      <p>“I like Barboza as well, but us fighting would be an interesting matchup. People like him a lot, too. He beat the same guys I beat - and I’m sure he won that last fight but they gave the win to [<a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2970/paul-felder">Paul Felder</a>].”</p>
      <p>Aside from Felder, who has lost to both Trinaldo and Barboza in the past—Felder won a close decision when they rematched recently—they have shared four other opponents. Both Brazilians beat <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/154/ross-pearson">Ross Pearson</a>, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/59/evan-dunham">Evan Dunham</a> and Green, and lost to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2665/kevin-lee">Kevin Lee</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think it would be a good fight for the fans,” Trinaldo said. “It could be a main event in Brasilia, a good fight to sell for the fans… I’m sure we would go to war and break each other up in there. Barboza is tough, but I have tough training partners, too. I can do five rounds no problem. It would be a standup war. I’m ready.”</p>
