      <h1>Giveaway to city school bus drivers is a must-veto for Gov. Cuomo</h1>

      <p>Kudos to the Citizens Budget Commission for flagging yet another horrible bill that demands a veto from Gov. Andrew Cuomo: an outrageous effort to give school bus drivers special privileges at city taxpayers’ expense.</p>
      <p>For decades, the city included these “employee-protection provisions” in its contracts with private bus companies. The EPPs forced companies to hire off “seniority” lists that mandated expensive pay and benefits.</p>
      <p>But the requirements were always incompatible with state law. The 2011 ruling from the state’s top court noted that the city Department of Education couldn’t remotely show that the scheme was “designed to save the public money, encourage robust competition or prevent favoritism.”</p>
      <p>Then-Mayor Mike Bloomberg proceeded to bid out bus contracts with no EPPs — and the city saw six-figure savings.</p>
      <p>Lobbyists got Mayor Bill de Blasio to reinsert the EPPs in the companies’ contracts last year — only to lose in court again. So the drivers’ unions turned to the Legislature.</p>
      <p>The city already spends $1.4 billion a year on student transportation, far above the national average on a per-student, per-mile basis. Backroom deals shouldn’t force it to spend even more.</p>
      <p>Veto away, Governor.</p>
