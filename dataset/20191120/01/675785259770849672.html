      <h1>Murdered Brit backpacker Grace Millane 'gave man list of her kinky sex fetishes'</h1>
      <h2>Grace Millane shared her 'BDSM interests' with a man she messaged on the fetish dating website Whiplr. The Brit backpacker was allegedly murdered after a Tinder date in Auckland, New Zealand</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:47:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:47</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Slain backpacker Grace Millane gave a man she met on a BDSM dating site a list of her kinky sex fetishes, her murder trial was told today.</p>
      <p>Just months before she was killed during a Tinder date, the university graduate from Essex spelled out exactly what she wanted to learn, including bondage, electrical nerve stimulation and “breath-play” using a gas mask.</p>
      <p>A statement given by the man to New Zealand police was read to the jury at Auckland High Court today after they were told he has refused to cooperate with defence lawyers.</p>
      <p>He described the 21-year-old, whose parents David and Gill listened to the statement from the public gallery, as “naive and trusting”.</p>

      <p>She had contacted him via the Whiplr website for BDSM enthusiasts in the summer of 2018, just before she left Britain on a worldwide adventure, he said.</p>
      <p>She told him she had begun her interest in BDSM through a past boyfriend but he said she was still quite naive and, unusually, used her full name on another messaging app they had used.</p>
      <p>“Grace and I discussed our BDSM interests,” the man, whose identity is protected, had told police.</p>
      <p>“Grace told me she was interested in everything to do with BDSM and her main area of interest was restraint.</p>

      <p>“In Grace’s Whiplr profile she outlined her sub kink interests as: giving full control, sounds, accessories, restraints, control and massages</p>
      <p>“I can’t remember discussing any specific BDSM interests with Grace in detail but I think she was into Daddy Dom.</p>
      <p>“I think Grace was at an explorative stage and quite open to suggestions. Grace seemed quite keen to know what things were and what sort of things I owned pertaining to BDSM.</p>
      <p>“I told Grace about my interest in breath-play, electro and water bondage which I had to explain to Grace because she didn’t know about it.</p>

      <p>“I explained my interests with explicit examples of what I have done with partners previously, for example water bondage I suggested a hogtie and a bath full of water, e-stim I have used a tens (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) machine kit and breath-play with a gas mask with a rebreather.</p>
      <p>"Grace told me she was quite open to it and said she wanted to try.”</p>
      <p>The court has previously a statement from a former partner of Grace’s who said they had an established practice of choking using safe words and “tapping out” which meant it had never put her in danger.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man, whose identity is also protected, has denied murdering Grace on December 1 last year, the night before her 22nd birthday, after a night of heavy drinking which ended in his apartment.</p>

      <p>He claims she died accidentally after asking him to apply pressure to her neck, but in a police interview said he was unaware she had died until he found her on the floor the next morning.</p>
      <p>He admits disposing of her body in a suitcase he buried in the woods.</p>
      <p>In the statement read today, her Whiplr contact said he and Grace had agreed to meet in person for a drink but she then changed plans.</p>
      <p>“BDSM probably became more popular after 50 Shades of Grey but that is more the soft end of BDSM,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t recall if Grace ever mentioned 50 Shades of Grey. I felt like Grace was more naive and trusting in the BDSM area.</p>

      <p>“When you’re using these apps, the users do not have to provide any details at all so you have to be aware.</p>
      <p>"The users could be any undesirable person online and Grace seemed to have a naivety.”</p>
      <p>The jury today also heard from a leading expert in sexual culture and pornography, Professor Clarissa Smith, from the University of Sunderland.</p>
      <p>Speaking via a video link she said erotic asphyxiation, like other forms of BDSM, was becoming a more mainstream interest for young women and men in the wake of the 50 Shades of Grey book, which has sold 125 million copies.</p>
      <p>She described it as “a form of play that practitioners call edge play. It makes the heart race, makes the skin tingle, had very significant elements of feeling powerless and offers lightheadedness and exhilaration.”</p>

      <p>But Prof Smith said: “It’s very important that consent is given.”</p>
      <p>She told the court younger women were increasingly open about sexuality and saying what they wanted and that “hook up” apps were part of “a gamification of dating and sexuality.”</p>
      <p>“We are no longer living in the era of lay back and think of England,” she said.</p>
      <p>Another witness told the trial he and Grace had slept together the night before she died after meeting at the backpackers' hostel where she was staying.</p>
      <p>The man, who name is suppressed, said they went to McDonalds before going to his house to watch a movie, then had sex.</p>

        <figcaption>Grace was filmed holding hands with the defendant</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He said he may have held her around the neck during sex but not at her request.</p>
      <p>It was something he had “potentially” done because it was a habit of his “because girls usually enjoy it”, he said.</p>
      <p>There was no discussion about it with Grace, who had stayed the night with him.</p>
      <p>The jury were also told about messages Grace exchanged with two unknown men on Whiplr in 2017, in some of which she took the role of a “submissive slave” being given tasks by a dominant “master”.</p>
      <p>She had said she wished to be “fully restrained during sexual activity”, defence barrister Claire Farquhar.</p>
      <p>The defence have closed their case, with the defendant choosing not to give evidence. Prosecution and defence will give closing speeches on Thursday before the judge sums up on Friday.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
