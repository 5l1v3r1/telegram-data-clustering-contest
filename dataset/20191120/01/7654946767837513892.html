      <p>Roasting a turkey used to mean hours of pacing and peering into the oven. But thanks to a trendy kitchen gadget, home cooks can now make a beautiful brown bird in a mere hour.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely 100 percent possible,” food blogger Jeffrey Eisner tells The Post. The 38-year-old Astoria resident, who runs a recipe blog called <a href="https://pressureluckcooking.com/">Pressure Luck Cooking</a>, is on a mission to prove to that you can make an entire turkey — as well as stuffing and gravy — in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Air-Fryer-Combo/dp/B07VT23JDM?tag=nypost-20?tag=nypost-20?tag=nypost-20">an Instant Pot</a>, the superspeedy electric multicooker that’s taken over American kitchens the past two years.</p>
      <p>“It’s a new way of cooking,” says Eisner of the pumped-up pressure cooker. “When you have an appliance like this that can do it all, why not push the limits to see if it can make a turkey?”</p>

      <p>To that end, he’s spent the past few weeks toting the inner lining of his Instant Pot around his supermarket’s frozen turkey section, to demonstrate how smaller birds — in the 7- to 9 ½-pound range — nestle neatly inside.</p>
      <p>Although Eisner cooks with a large 8-quart Instant Pot Duo Crisp + Air Fryer, a smaller 6-quart model should work as long as the turkey fits.</p>
      <p>“It’s OK” if your turkey “pokes up above the [pot] a little bit,” he says, as long as you can “press it down” when the bird thaws. To be safe, he says you should bring your pot to the store, like he did, to confirm that your turkey fits.</p>
      <p>For his great Thanksgiving experiment, Eisner went with a 9-pound turkey, which serves about eight people. It would take around 3 hours to roast in an oven (a little longer if you stuff it), but in Eisner’s Instant Pot, it was done — stuffing and all — in 50 minutes. He says a smaller bird could cook in as little as 40 minutes.</p>
      <p>Despite the short cook time, if you do it right, “it should taste like a turkey that was made all day in the oven,” Eisner says.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t mean you can repeatedly hit snooze on Thanksgiving morning: There’s still prep to factor in. If you’ve bought your bird frozen, you have to thaw it in the fridge two to four days before sticking it in the pressure cooker. If you want to brine it, as Eisner does, that’s another 12 hours. And if you plan to cook stuffing, veggies and gravy in the Instant Pot, too — which Eisner does using the saute function — you should factor in another hour on Thanksgiving Day.</p>

      <p>The shortcut does have a downside: turkey skin that’s more soft than crackly.</p>
      <p>“When you pressure-cook something, you’re not going to get crispy results,” says Eisner.</p>
      <p>There is a fix for that, though. First, Eisner bastes the cooked turkey with a browning, caramelizing seasoning, such as Gravy Master.</p>
      <p>From there, you have two options: If you have a new Instant Pot, you can use the air fryer function on the lid to crisp up the bird in 10 minutes. (You can also buy a third-party air fryer lid for an older pot.) Or you can just stick your turkey in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 minutes, until it browns up.</p>
      <p>“And there you go: turkey, stuffing and gravy!” says Eisner.</p>
      <p>The blogger, who says his love for cooking is inspired by his late grandmother, Lil, knows that his unconventional turkey methods might raise eyebrows. But he thinks people shouldn’t be ashamed to buck tradition with this Instant turkey dinner.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, if something is going to make your life easier and you’re going to do something in a fraction of the time, where’s the shame in that?” he says. “You gotta accept change and embrace it.”</p>

      <h3>Recipe for a 1-Hour Turkey Dinner</h3>
      <p><b>The night before: </b>Using paper towels, pat dry a 7- to 9 ½-pound turkey. Place it in an oven bag or a large pot with 2 cups of turkey brine seasoning and 1 gallon of water. Brine in fridge for 12 hours.</p>
      <p><b>On Thanksgiving day:</b> Make stuffing using your favorite recipe. Chop 2 stalks of celery and 2 large carrots into discs, and quarter 2 medium yellow onions.</p>
      <p>Take your turkey out of the bag or pot it was brining in and remove the giblets from the carcass. Fill the turkey’s cavity with stuffing, then place the bird on the trivet that comes with your Instant Pot (it’s the metal insert with collapsible handles), stuffing-side up. Lower the trivet into your Instant Pot. Pour in 2 cups of chicken or turkey broth, and stuff celery, carrots and onion in wherever you can fit them.</p>
      <p>You’re ready to cook. Secure the lid shut, place the steam valve in the sealed position and set your high-pressure cook time. A 7-pound turkey needs 40 minutes; a 9 ½-pound turkey needs 50.</p>
      <p>“At this point, we can just sit back and drink some wine,” says Eisner. When the timer beeps, let the pressure cooker’s steam release naturally for 12 minutes. Then, spin the steam valve to let out remaining steam.</p>
      <p>Lift the turkey (not the vegetables) out of the pot and paint on a browning and caramelizing seasoning, such as Gravy Master. Then, crisp up the turkey one of two ways: If you have an air-frying lid for your Instant Pot, place the lid back on and air-fry for 10 minutes. If you don’t, place the turkey in a roasting pan and roast in the oven at 350 degrees until golden, about 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, make the gravy. Degrease the leftover turkey juices in a fat separator, or skim the liquid with a ladle or baster. Set your Instant Pot to saute mode and add 2 packets of gravy mix to the vegetables that cooked alongside your turkey. Stir. When the mixture bubbles, add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of water. Continue to stir until the mixture thickens, about 2 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the gravy with a slotted spoon.</p>
