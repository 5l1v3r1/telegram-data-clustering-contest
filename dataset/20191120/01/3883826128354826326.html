        <b>A UK ticket-holder has won the full £105m Euromillions jackpot.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The winning numbers picked were 8, 10, 15, 30 and 42, with 4 and 6 selected for the Lucky Star numbers.</p>
      <p>It is the sixth EuroMillions jackpot won by a UK ticket-holder this year, and coincides with the 25th anniversary of the first National Lottery draw.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, urged players to check their tickets to "see if they have won big".</p>
      <p>Another player also became a millionaire by matching the "Millionaire Maker" code ZMSF62402.</p>
      <p>The win comes a month after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50004518">a UK ticket-holder claimed a record £170m EuroMillions jackpot</a>, making them Britain's richest ever lottery winner and earning them a place on the Sunday Times' Rich List of the 1,000 wealthiest people living in the UK or with British business links.</p>

      <p>This week the National Lottery celebrated 25 years since the first draw on 19 November 1994.</p>
      <p>To mark the occasion, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50473195">Radio 1's Newsbeat spoke to Jamie Heavens, a roofer from Bournemouth</a>, who became a millionaire at the age of 22, about what it is like to win such a sum overnight.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't really sink in until the money hits your account. There's a sense of relief that you can go and do what you want to do," he said.</p>
      <p>"People think I'm minted - that I'm cash rich and can just go and buy what I want every day. But it's not like that."</p>
