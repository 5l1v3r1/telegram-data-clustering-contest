      <p>A Belfast man has admitted trying to kill his father in a nursing home.</p>
      <p>With a jury sworn in ready to hear evidence, James Anderson Weir (67) had been due to go on trial at Downpatrick Crown Court but instead, defence QC Niall Hunt asked trial Judge Geoffrey Miller QC for the charge to be put to Weir again.</p>
      <p>It was then that Weir, from Manor Street, admitted trying to kill his father James Weir Snr on November 24 last year.</p>
      <p>An earlier court heard how staff at the Newtownards care home contacted police after they saw Weir holding a pillow above his father’s face, believing he was trying to “suffocate” his dad.</p>
      <p>Having taken the pillow off him Mr Weir Snr, who has since passed away, was examined by a doctor and taken to hospital while his intoxicated son was arrested.</p>
      <p>In court yesterday, Judge Miller freed Weir on continuing bail, ordered a pre-sentence report and said he would pass sentence in the New Year.</p>
