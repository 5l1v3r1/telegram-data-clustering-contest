      <h1>‘The Grudge’ Featurette Promises a “Much More Intense Experience” Than the Previous Films</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:30:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p>What can we expect from the new <b><i>The Grudge</i></b>? According to producer <b>Sam Raimi</b>, a “much more intense experience” than any <i>Grudge</i> film before. This new <i>The Grudge</i> featurette has a glimpse at some creepy scenes from the new movie, as well as the cast talking up how damn scary it all is. While it’s in their best interest to talk this project up, you have to admit that the footage on display here does indeed look creeptastic.</p>

      <p>Is there any buzz for the new <i>Grudge</i>? I can’t tell, but I remain cautiously optimistic. While there wasn’t exactly a huge <i>need</i> for a <i>Grudge</i> reboot, the talent involved with this project is too good to ignore. The cast includes <b>Andrea Riseboroug</b>h, <b>John Cho</b>, <b>Betty Gilpin</b>, and more, and – most promising of all – comes from director <b>Nicolas Pesce</b>, the filmmaker responsible for the nightmarish <i>The Eyes of My Mother</i>.</p>
      <p>Pesce only pops-up briefly in this featurette, while producer Sam Raimi (who also produced the previous <i>Grudge</i> reboot) gets to do most of the talking. Raimi promises a movie that both ties into the original <i>Grudge</i> while also opening the story up for all-new thrills and chills. It definitely looks as if we’re in for something new here and not a retread of the same old thing. That’s good! And after the box office stumbles of <i>Men In Black: International</i> and the recent <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, Sony is in need of a hit. And horror continues to draw a crowd.</p>
      <p>In <i>The Grudge</i>, “a single mother and young detective, Muldoon (Andrea Riseborough), discovers that a suburban house is cursed by a vengeful ghost that dooms those who enter it with a violent death. Now, she runs to save herself and her son from demonic spirits from the cursed house in her neighborhood.”</p>
      <p><i>The Grudge</i> will give you the creeps on <b>January 3, 2020</b>.</p>
