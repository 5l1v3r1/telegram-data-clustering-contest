      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- LSU remained at the top of this week's College Football Playoff rankings, while Alabama stayed at No. 5 following star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's season-ending hip injury.</p>
      <p>The selection committee announced the third of six sets of rankings Tuesday on ESPN. The remainder of the top four remained the same: No. 2 Ohio State, No. 3 Clemson and No. 4 Georgia.</p>
      <p>Committee chair Rob Mullens said Tuesday that Tagovailoa's injury didn't factor into Alabama's current ranking. The Crimson Tide cruised to a 38-7 win over Mississippi State on Saturday.</p>
      <p>No. 6 Oregon and No. 7 Utah, both earning blowout wins over the weekend, kept the same ranks as last week. Previously undefeated Minnesota slipped from eighth to No. 10 after a 23-19 loss to Iowa, and Penn State moved up one spot to No. 8 following a win over Indiana.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma, fresh off a comeback victory against then-unbeaten Baylor, jumped to No. 9. Baylor fell one spot to drop to No. 14.</p>
      <p>The Big Ten again features the most teams in the rankings with six. No. 12 Wisconsin, No. 13 Michigan and No. 17 Iowa each moved up in this week's rankings.</p>
      <p>Kansas State, Navy and Texas fell out of the rankings after losses this weekend, making room for newcomers No. 22 Iowa State, No. 23 USC and No. 25 SMU.</p>
      <p>The fourth set of College Football Playoff rankings will be revealed next Tuesday at 7 p.m. EST on ESPN. Rankings will also be announced Dec. 3, before selection day on Dec. 8.</p>
      <p>The 2019-20 College Football Playoff semifinals will take place Dec. 28. The College Football Playoff National Championship Game is scheduled for Jan. 13 at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.</p>
