      <h1>CFB Playoff Chairman On Why Alabama Is Ahead Of Oregon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:36:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>There weren’t any surprises in this week’s edition of the College Football Playoff rankings. LSU, Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia make up the top-four while Alabama and Oregon are on the outside looking in. You can find the rest of the rankings <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">here</a>.</p>
      <p>The current top four teams aren’t set in stone just yet. LSU and Georgia are likely to play in the SEC championship. Ohio State still has to play Penn State and Michigan. Clemson seems to be the only team in the top-four that one could confidently say will reach the playoff.</p>
      <p>In a scenario where LSU beats Georgia – therefore knocking the Bulldogs out of playoff contention – who will earn the fourth and final playoff spot? As it stands right now, it’s going to come down to No. 5 Alabama and No. 6 Oregon.</p>
      <p>The debate has already begun concerning the two teams. Both teams have just one loss as the Crimson Tide fell to No. 1 LSU while the Ducks dropped a close game to No. 15 Auburn in their season opener.</p>
      <p>Seeing that Auburn is a common opponent for the two teams, that may turn out to be the deciding factor. If Alabama is able to take care of business against the Auburn Tigers – something the Ducks weren’t able to do – the Crimson Tide may get the nod and be selected to the No. 4 seed.</p>

      <p>But something the Ducks could end up having – if they beat No. 7 Utah in the Pac-12 championship – is a top 10 win, a feat Alabama doesn’t have this season. Plus, a win over Utah would ensure Oregon a conference championship, another resume booster the Crimson Tide won’t have.</p>
      <p>This debate seems like it’s just getting started. Alabama and Oregon still have a lot to prove over the final few weeks of the regular season.</p>
