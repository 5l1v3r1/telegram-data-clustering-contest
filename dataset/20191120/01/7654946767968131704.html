      <h1>Greg Bird’s future with Yankees is at its crossroads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:02:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:02</time> by <a rel="author">George A. King III</a></address>
      <p>By 8 p.m. Wednesday, the Yankees have to make a decision that will impact Greg Bird’s future with the organization.</p>
      <p>That’s the deadline for teams to tender contracts to players on the 40-man roster who aren’t signed for the 2020 season. If a player isn’t offered a contract, he becomes a free agent. If he is offered a contract, he becomes a signed player with a salary to be determined later.</p>
      <p>As of Tuesday night, the Yankees’ 40-man roster was at 36, and that didn’t include 18-game winner Domingo German, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/mlb-narrows-down-length-of-domingo-german-suspension-with-decision-close/">who is expected to be suspended</a> at the start of next season for violating MLB’s domestic abuse policy this year.</p>
      <p>With prospects Estevan Florial, Deivi Garcia, Luis Gil, Rony Garcia and Nick Nelson likely to be added to the 40-man roster to protect them from being selected in the Rule 5 draft at next month’s winter meetings in San Diego, the Yankees need to clear roster space. And that is before any free agents are signed.</p>
      <p>Teams often make trades leading to the deadline before not tendering players. While not tendering right-hander Chance Adams would be an easy call if he isn’t dealt, that’s not the case with the 27-year-old Bird, who was the Yankees’ Opening Day first baseman and homered in the 7-2 win over the Orioles.</p>
      <p>After a solid 2015, when the left-handed-hitting first baseman filled in well for Mark Teixeira by hitting .261 with 11 homers, 31 RBIs and a .872 OPS in 46 games, Bird <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/26/greg-bird-cant-believe-this-turned-into-another-lost-yankees-season/">has been crushed by injuries</a>. He missed all of 2016 because of right shoulder surgery and was limited to a combined 130 games in 2017 and 2018 because of surgeries on the right ankle. This past season, Bird appeared in 10 games before going on the injured list on April 16 with a tear in the left plantar fascia and missed the rest of the season. He played in seven games <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/23/yankees-greg-bird-quietly-reemerges-in-dominican-republic/">for Gigantes in the Dominican Winter League</a> to reacclimate to baseball activities and went 3-for-24 (.125).</p>
      <p>Despite the injury history, Bird, who has three minor league options remaining, would draw interest if he is a free agent because of his age and a sweet swing that is built for Yankee Stadium. Bird made $1.2 million last year when he was eligible for arbitration for the first time. If not traded or offered a major league contract, Bird could return to the Yankees on a minor league deal and go to spring training and enter a crowded first base mix that will include DJ LeMahieu, Luke Voit and possibly Mike Ford, who is on the 40-man roster.</p>
