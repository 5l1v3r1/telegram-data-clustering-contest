      <h1>ALERT! Shoppers warned of fake Woolworths coupon scam </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:13:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/sdobeson/" target="_blank">Shanee Dobeson</a></address>
      <p>Woolworths has issued an urgent warning to shoppers over a fake and convincing coupon scam currently doing the rounds.</p>
      <p>The supermarket giant said the scam has been targeting people on Facebook, pretending to offer them $100 off their next shop if they share the link with their friends.</p>
      <p>It even features an official-looking barcode with the Woolworths logo and other branding.</p>
      <p>“Scams are often specially designed to look genuine, and often copy features from legitimate communications such as our logo and branding,” Woolworths said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Woolworths will never email, message, or call you to ask for your personal or financial information including your password, credit card details or account information.</p>
      <p>“For example, the link might take you to the website www.woolwoorths.com.au instead of www.woolworths.com.au.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the supermarket giant has reported the scam to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and ScamWatch.</p>
