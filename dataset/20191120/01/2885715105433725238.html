      <p>Wednesday will be a special day for Flying Sikh Milkha Singh as the former Commonwealth Games and Asian Games athlete turns 90.</p>
      <p>Singh, who was born in village Govindpura (now in Punjab, Pakistan), will celebrate the day with his family at his Sector 8 residence.</p>
      <p>“I am thankful to the almighty…It’s like any other day for me and I will be playing golf and going for my run in the morning. As always, I don’t believe in celebrating my birthday in a grand manner and have a party. Since my grandson Harjai Milkha Singh wants me to celebrate the birthday, we will cut a cake in the evening…To see my fans and the youngsters remain fit and believing in doing a physical activity daily will be my biggest gift from them and I am glad that I can inspire younger generation to pursue sport,” he told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Newsline.</p>
      <p>While Singh’s son Jeev Milkha Singh is Malaysia to play in the Sabah Masters, Singh’s wife Nirmal Kaur, daughter-in-law Kudrat Milha Singh and grandson Harjai Milha Singh will be at home to celebrate the former athlete’s birthday.</p>
