      <h1>This draft day deal keeps on giving. Now there’s a new ‘Stocker trade’ leader</h1>

      <h3>It is the draft day trade that keeps on giving. Now, there’s another twist.</h3>
      <p>For the best part of a year, the trade between Adelaide and Carlton has been one of footy’s most hotly-debated trades.</p>
      <p>During the 2018 national draft, the Blues orchestrated a bombshell trade by handing Adelaide their 2019 first-round pick in exchange for Pick 19 and the Crows’ 2019 first-round pick.</p>

      <p>Carlton was keen to land Liam Stocker — which it rated incredibly highly among the 2018 draft prospects — and seized its chance. The Blues took the Sandringham Dragons young gun with that late first-round pick.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, that Crows-Blues deal quickly became known as the ‘Stocker trade’.</p>
      <p>Cue a chain of accountability, led by Twitter account <i>@CrowsPick</i>, which tracked the movement of Carlton and Adelaide’s new 2019 first-round picks for after they were swapped in the deal.</p>

      <p>By the end of Round 23, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-2019-the-result-of-the-bombshell-draft-night-trade-between-adelaide-and-carlton/news-story/b09c325c5a2baefb0c61dd62b0f0e780">there appeared to be a winner</a> — maybe by a nose — according to the AFL’s Draft Pick Value Index.</p>
      <p>But two months later, there’s been another twist.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday afternoon, Adelaide struck a deal with Greater Western Sydney, which saw first-round picks — including <i>that</i> selection linked to Carlton — change hands.</p>
      <p>And when you analyse how the ‘Stocker trade’ now looks, there might be a new winner. Here’s why.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE DEAL BROKEN DOWN</b>
      </p>
      <p>— Carlton acquired 2018 Pick 19 (Stocker) and Adelaide’s 2019 first-round selection (Pick 9), which equals 2417 points.</p>
      <p>— The Crows picked up Carlton’s 2019 first-round selection (Pick 4), which equals 2034 points.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Note: Both selections in 2019 were pushed back after the AFL handed Gold Coast a compensation)</i>
      </p>
      <p>— One Tuesday, Adelaide traded Pick 4 (2034 points) to the Giants for Pick 6 (1751 points). As part of the deal, the Crows also received the Giants’ future first-round pick (worth between 3,000 and 948 points, but in all likelihood it’ll be closer to the smaller number).</p>
      <p>So what does this all mean? The Crows cannot ‘lose’ the trade, as per the index.</p>
      <p>That’s even if the Giants win the 2020 premiership.</p>
      <p>However, Carlton’s decision to make a bold play for Stocker — and eventually land him — cannot be dubbed as a poor error.</p>

      <p>The Blues rated Stocker, the winner of the 2018 Morrish medal, as the sixth-best player in last year’s draft pool. Not only did they draft him, Stocker was able to spend all of 2019 at the club so keen to develop him, which saw him play five senior games.</p>
      <p>The 2018 Morrish Medal winner would likely have been rated in the 10-15 range by club recruiters if he was in this year’s draft pool.</p>
      <p>So instead of leaving the picks where they were pre-trade, the Blues got their man. And as the 19-year-old begins his second pre-season, there’s still so much upside around him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE ‘STOCKER TRADE’ POINTS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Carlton:</b> 2018 Pick 19 (948 points) + 2019 Pick 9 (1469) = 2417</p>
      <p><b>Adelaide:</b> 2019 Pick 6 (1751) + 2020 first-round pick tied to GWS’ finishing position (between Pick 1 (3000 points) and Pick 19* (948 points)) = At the very least 2699</p>
      <p>
        <i>* The Giants would receive Pick 19 if they win the 2020 Grand Final, with Gold Coast guaranteed a mid first-round compensation in 2020.</i>
