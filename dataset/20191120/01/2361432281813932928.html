      <p>Say goodbye to RuPaul Charles and hello to the “legendary” Ruby Red, because the first teaser for Netflix’s upcoming comedy “AJ and the Queen” has dropped.</p>
      <p>The video, which you can view above, is short but glows with the promise of what’s to come when the series premieres. Oh, that reminds us, Netflix announced on Tuesday that the show will drop Jan. 10.</p>
      <p>Here’s the official description for “AJ and the Queen,” which stars RuPaul, as well as Izzy G., Michael-Leon Wooley, Tia Carrere, Josh Segarra and Katerina Tannenbaum:</p>

      <blockquote>Robert Lee (RuPaul), better known as the drag queen Ruby Red, has big dreams of opening his very own drag club. After years of performing in clubs all across the country, he has scrimped and saved and is one signed lease away from turning his dreams into a reality until he realizes he’s been swindled by a charismatic grifter (Josh Segarra) and his eye-patch wearing partner-in-crime, Lady Danger (Tia Carrere). With his heart broken and money stolen, Robert has no choice but to pick up the pieces and start over, and a cross country Ruby Red roadshow provides the perfect opportunity to do just that.<br/>But when AJ (Izzy G.), a scrappy, streetwise 10-year-old escaping a difficult home life, stows away in Robert’s rundown RV, the consummate performer suddenly finds himself in a new set of shoes: de facto parent. Fabulously mismatched yet perfectly paired, AJ and Ruby must find a way to navigate through tough times as they learn a few tricks from one another and roll on to brighter days.</blockquote>
      <p>The series is co-created by RuPaul and “Sex and the City” mastermind Michael Patrick King, who both executive produce along with Jhoni Marchinko. King is showrunner on the series, which features performances by RuPaul in each episode.</p>
      <p>MPK Productions produces in association with Warner Bros. TV.</p>
