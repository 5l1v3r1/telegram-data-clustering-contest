      <h1>New study bolsters efforts to save endangered Hawaiian duck</h1>

      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - New findings suggest conservation efforts aimed at protecting an endangered Hawaiian duck are working.</p>
      <p>The koloa is threatened with genetic extinction due to interbreeding with feral mallards over the decades.</p>
      <p>Koloa are the only endemic ducks remaining on the main Hawaiian Islands. They are primarily found on Kauai where researchers say there are few hybrid birds there.</p>
      <p>But a recent study published in the journal Molecular Ecology found the duck’s genetic diversity is greater than expected.</p>
      <p>Scientists say this study is pivotal in the struggle to save the duck from extinction.</p>
      <p>“This study lays the foundation for a new chapter in the recovery of the koloa, a new trajectory towards recovery and de-listing as an endangered species,” Andy Engilis, study co-author and curator of the UC Davis Museum of Wildlife and Fish Biology, said.</p>
      <p>Koloa once roamed all the Hawaiian islands until their numbers diminished due to habitat loss, predators and overhunting.</p>
      <p>“Its recovery could be viewed as a beacon of hope for the many dozens of critically endangered birds found in the islands,” said Engilis.</p>
