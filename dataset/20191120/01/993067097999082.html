      <p>AN integrated school that has made "an indelible impact" on its community has moved into a new building.</p>
      <p>Corran Integrated PS has been opened since 1991 and has since become an inextricable part of the fabric of Larne and wider area.</p>
      <p>Roisin Marshall, Chief Executive of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, said it was the third new build to open through the `fresh start' initiative.</p>
      <p>"I am looking forward to seeing further progress on the remaining projects. This has given integrated education an invaluable boost enabling schools that started as a twinkle in parents' eyes to grow and be strong, sustainable, integrated schools that they dreamt off creating," she said.</p>
      <p>Principal Denise Macfarlane added: "We are delighted with our new, purpose-built school building. It's like a dream come true. Our school started in 1991 in an industrial estate then moved to mobile classrooms in Blackcave North the following year. It's been a long wait but it's been worth it."</p>
