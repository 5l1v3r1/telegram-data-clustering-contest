      <h2>The Juventus midfielder has missed the majority of Wales' qualifying campaign through injury but he returned when it mattered to fire his side into the finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:01:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey fired Wales back to the Euros last night after making up for lost time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> midfielder Ramsey was recalled and justified his inclusion with a deadly brace.</p>
      <p>First he buried an early header and then slotted in a right-foot shot after the break on his first competitive start for Wales since September 2018.</p>
      <p>Victory ensured the Euro 2016 semi-finalists beat Hungary to clinch second spot in Group E behind Croatia.</p>
      <p>Ramsey, 28, said: “It was a big effort and I missed a lot of this campaign but it was all worthwhile. I chipped in with a couple of goals which is amazing.</p>

      <p>“It means everything. We inspired a nation last time out so we wanted to do it again.</p>
      <p>“There are some players here who haven’t experienced this, so we wanted to give them a taste of it. We have a great squad and a lot of great young players coming through.</p>
      <p>“We always knew it was going to be a tight group and it would come down to the last couple of games.”</p>
      <p>Captain Gareth Bale crossed for Ramsey to head in on 15 minutes before he doubled the lead with his 16th international goal to climb to seventh in Wales' list of all-time scorers.</p>
      <p>After a fifth qualifier without defeat, Bale added: “He’s a world class player and it’s great to have him back. He showed again what a great player he is and two more goals helped us.</p>

      <p>“We’ve been getting better and better through the campaign and we’ve embraced the challenge.</p>
      <p>“This is the position we wanted to be in – challenging to qualify and we took it in our stride, played with confidence, and got the vital win to get us through.</p>
      <p>“We had the best time of our lives in France and we’ll try to go and enjoy it again with our amazing fans.”</p>
