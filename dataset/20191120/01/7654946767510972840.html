      <h1>Mets showing interest in catcher Robinson Chirinos</h1>

      <p>The Mets, clearly motivated to improve their catching corps, have expressed interest in free agent Robinson Chirinos, according to an industry source.</p>
      <p>Chirinos, who will turn 36 next June, enjoyed a strong 2019 season with the Astros, starting 106 games behind the plate and posting a .238/.347/.443 slash line while playing strong defense, tallying only four passed balls. If the Mets retain starting catcher Wilson Ramos, then Chirinos very well might receive better opportunities elsewhere. Yet the Mets did reach out to the Venezuela native.</p>
      <p>Another catcher whom the Mets have contacted as a depth option is Drew Butera, 36, who began his career as a Mets prospect (Omar Minaya drafted him in the fifth round of the 2005 amateur draft, Minaya’s first year as general manager) before he was traded to the Twins for Luis Castillo in 2007. Butera, prized for his ability to connect with pitchers — Clayton Kershaw publicly saluted him after winning one of his Cy Young Awards — played in 16 games for the Rockies last season, with a slash line of .163/.229/.233. He clocked 67 games for the Rockies’ Triple-A Albuquerque affiliate, with a slash line of .300/.389/.511.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/why-mets-catching-upgrade-likely-wont-include-yasmani-grandal/">The Mets’ search for catching</a> might spell the end for Tomas Nido, himself a favorite batterymate of pitchers such as Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard. Nido, who started 38 games at catcher for the Mets last season and had a .191/.231/.316 slash line, will be out of minor league options in 2020. He could serve as a secondary trade piece as the team tries to fill other voids. One obvious fit: Pittsburgh, which needs catchers and has a veteran center fielder, Starling Marte, to shop as the Mets look for a true center fielder.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Jerry Narron, the former Reds and Rangers manager who has served as a bench coach for three National League clubs (Reds, Brewers and Diamondbacks), recently met with Mets manager Carlos Beltran and assistant GM Allard Baird in New York to discuss <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/05/brodie-van-wagenen-may-have-spilled-mets-jerry-narron-interest/">the team’s bench coach opening</a>, a source said. The Mets also were scheduled to interview former Marlins and Braves manager Fredi Gonalez for the same job.</p>
      <p>John Gibbons, a long-ago Mets catcher who managed in their minor league system before managing the Blue Jays twice, spoke with Mets GM Brodie Van Wagenen on the phone about the bench-coach opening, but won’t interview in person.</p>
      <p>Given Beltran’s inexperience, the Mets want their bench coach to have plenty of reps in National League action.</p>
