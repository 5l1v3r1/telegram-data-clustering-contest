      <p>The Tennessee Titans have a very proud tradition of successful kickers over the past couple of decades, ranging from Al Del Greco, Joe Nedney and the late Rob Bironas to now Ryan Succop.</p>
      <p>That’s what makes this season so very surprising.</p>
      <p>The Titans are on their third kicker and already have missed eight field-goal tries through 10 games to match the team’s most misses since 2004 when they missed eight, a dubious mark they also had in 2001. They rank dead last in the NFL, converting 46.7% (7-for-15).</p>
      <p>They’re not alone.</p>
      <p>Kickers across the NFL are struggling to put the ball between the uprights this season. The 79.7% conversion rate through Week 11 is the league’s lowest number since 2003 when kickers hit 79.2%, missing 198 attempts, according to SportRadar.</p>

      <p><b>Dolphins’ Walton cut after arrest:</b> Miami released suspended running back Mark Walton hours after he was arrested on charges of punching his pregnant girlfriend in the head.</p>
      <p>Police in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Davie said in a report that officers went to a home at 4:15 a.m. Tuesday, where Walton’s girlfriend told them he had pushed her against the wall and punched her several times in the face and head, leaving her with a swollen left eye.</p>
      <p>Walton, a second-year player, served a four-game suspension for violating NFL conduct and substance-abuse policies following three arrests last offseason in his hometown of Miami.</p>
      <p><b>Tomlin reflects on brawl: </b>Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin accepted his team’s role in the fight Thursday night that ended with Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett hitting Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph in the head with Rudolph’s helmet.</p>
      <p>Just don’t expect Tomlin to use the video of a brawl he called “ugly for the game of football” as a teachable moment. He doesn’t think one is required.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know that we did anything to make it happen in the first place,” Tomlin said Tuesday. “That’s why I said we didn’t have anything to learn from it.</p>
      <p>“All of us that are involved in the game, particularly at this level, want to safeguard and protect the game, its integrity. And in that instance, it was compromised, obviously with an unfortunate incident. None of us want those things to transpire. It did. We were a part of it. We accept responsibility of our actions within it.”</p>
