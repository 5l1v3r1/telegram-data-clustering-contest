      <h2>Diabetic Andy Lindsay saw his blood sugar levels were crashing while driving, prompting him to pull over in an industrial estate where a traffic warden snapped a photo of his illegally stopped car</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:12:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:12</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Pemberton</a></address>
      <p>A diabetic motorist has been slapped with a £120 fine after pulling over to avoid an accident due to his crashing blood sugar levels.</p>
      <p>Andy Lindsay suffered a hypoglycaemic attack while driving and pulled into an industrial estate until he was safe to set off again.</p>
      <p>During the 52-year-old's short stay at the side of the road he was snapped by a traffic warden and given a parking penalty.</p>
      <p>The sales representative has appealed the fine three times and provided evidence of his condition, but the parking company are refusing to budge.</p>
      <p>They have threatened to take him to court if he doesn't pay.</p>

      <p>Father-of-one Andy was diagnosed with type one diabetes aged 11 and sufferers are advised by the DVLA that it is dangerous to drive when blood sugar levels drop below millimoles per litre.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of hypoglycaemia include dizziness, nausea, confusion and drowsiness.</p>
      <p>Bronwyn, Andy's wife, said the firm has shown "no common sense" in dealing with the issue.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old said: "We understand the fine, but what we don't understand is that we have appealed it three times now and there seems to be no common sense.</p>
      <p>"Imagine if he had carried on driving and killed someone - I'm sure the family of that person would have asked, 'why didn't you pull over?'</p>
      <p>"I don't think they would have understood if he had said, 'well I didn't want to get a fine'."</p>
      <p>Andy, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, had pulled over onto the Calder Park Industrial Estate next to the M1 in Wakefield to let the symptoms pass.</p>
      <p>A traffic warden took a photograph of his car and he was hit with a £100 fine back in March by Excel Parking, which also operates under the name Vehicle Control Services Ltd.</p>
      <p>The fine has since increased to £120 and will rise to £180 plus court costs if the couple lose the appeal in court.</p>
      <p>Bronwyn, a hairdresser, added: "If it had been a council parking ticket I'm sure they would have used common sense and let us off by now.</p>
      <p>"This company feels like it's just a money-making scheme and nothing to do with parking or safety. He could have been dead at the wheel for all they cared."</p>
      <p>Excel Parking was contacted for comment.</p>
