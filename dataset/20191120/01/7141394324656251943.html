      <p>Galaxy Digital, a full-service crypto merchant bank based in New York, is introducing two new Bitcoin funds: the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund and the Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund.</p>
      <p>The new funds are garnering support from the industry’s biggest players, showing Bitcoin’s steady push and rising interest among institutional investors.</p>
      <p>Digital assets trading platform <a href="https://medium.com/bakkt-blog/raising-the-bar-announcing-bakkt-institutional-custody-ed5e2ad0da9a">Bakkt</a> and Fidelity Digital Assets will serve as the custodians. Bloomberg L.P. will serve as the pricing agent. Big Four auditing firms Deloitte and Ernst &amp; Young will provide tax and auditing services for both funds.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galaxy-digital-launches-bitcoin-funds-300960254.html">press release</a>, the funds are passively managed investments that provide exposure to the leading cryptocurrency at a low cost.</p>
      <p>A $25,000 minimum investment is needed for the Galaxy Bitcoin Fund, which has “quarterly liquidity.” The Galaxy Institutional Bitcoin Fund has “weekly liquidity” and requires a greater minimum investment. </p>
      <p>Steve Kurz, head of asset management at Galaxy Digital, says,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“The Galaxy Bitcoin Funds help accredited investors mitigate the complexities and risks of managing direct bitcoin investments. The funds provide investors bitcoin exposure with … best-in-class service providers, and Galaxy’s platform support.” </i>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Fidelity Digital Assets has just secured a license from the New York State Department of Financial Services, the company <a href="https://medium.com/@FidelityDigitalAssets/enabling-institutions-to-access-a-new-medium-for-assets-b9d8329c8766">announced</a> on Tuesday. The cryptocurrency arm of Boston-based Fidelity Investments will now be able to offer its cryptocurrency trading and custody services to companies based in the state.</p>
      <p>Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, says institutional interest is growing in the space.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We have experienced a high interest level from these firms and anticipate that their increased involvement in this industry would enable more activities and development across the spectrum.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Newcomer Bakkt, which is seeing a sustained uptick in demand, has also just crossed another milestone, reporting $100 million in monthly aggregated volume.</p>
