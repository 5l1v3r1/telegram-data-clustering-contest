      <p>New tax records show the Clinton Foundation accrued a near-$17 million loss in 2018, marking two years in a row that the foundation has lost money.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6549930-Clinton-Foundation-2018-990.html">records</a> highlight a $16.8 million loss by the foundation last year. The Clintons' nonprofit organization brought in only $30.7 million while spending $47.5 million.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the foundation lost $16.1 million for a combined two-year loss of $32.9 million. The $30 million in revenue in 2018 is shrunk from the near-$250 million the foundation received in 2009 when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.</p>
      <p>The foundation brought in $62.9 million as recently as 2016, when Clinton was running for president. The $47.5 million spent this year went toward grants, payroll, and promotions.</p>
      <p>"In 2018 our work was funded with individual contributions, institutional grants, savings from prior years, and interest from our endowment," a representative for the foundation <a href="https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/nov/14/clinton-center-shows-staying-power-2019/">said</a>. "We remain committed to operating programs that are effective, efficient, and sustainable."</p>
