      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 20 — <i>Frozen</i> actress Kristen Bell was honoured yesterday with a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, joking that a mugger would soon demand a woman’s purse on the same spot with the words “Let it go!”</p>
      <p>Bell, who came to fame on TV teen detective show <i>Veronica Mars</i> and appears in NBC’s <i>The Good Place</i>, unveiled her new star alongside fellow honouree Idina Menzel.</p>
      <p>The pair reprise their roles as Anna and Elsa in <i>Frozen 2</i>, the sequel to Disney’s animated smash hit out this Friday.</p>
      <p>“I am so grateful to be accepting this honour today on these hallowed streets where ‘Pretty Woman’ sold her body for money — it’s really a dream,” joked Bell.</p>
      <p>The ceremony took place toward the eastern end of the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
      <p><i>The Good Place</i> creator Michael Schur described the location as “the most glamorous location in all of show business — the semi-abandoned Starline Tours branch office.”</p>
      <p>The ceremony was attended by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Walt Disney Studios co-chairman Alan Horn.</p>
      <p>“As wonderful as this recognition feels in the moment, I know that it’s only temporary,” said Bell.</p>
      <p>She added: “This star will really only know its true value when inevitably, someone is mugged in that very spot, and as they clutch their purse, the assailant screams, ‘Let it go!’”</p>
      <p>“And the victim will look up and say, ‘That’s not even her song, you son of a b***h.’”</p>
      <p><i>Let It Go</i>, the Oscar-winning showstopper of the first <i>Frozen</i> movie, was sung by Menzel.</p>
      <p>Bell also paid tribute to Menzel, who has an enlarged role in the sequel.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to say it’s better than the first because all the music is good,” she told AFP. “But I will tell you they did the smartest thing with the second movie because they decided, rightfully so, to double down on Idina.</p>
      <p>“<i>Let It Go</i> was such a hit, and the geniuses at Disney were like ‘What if we just gave her two songs? Wouldn’t that be like twice as good?’ And guess what — it is,” Bell added. — AFP</p>
