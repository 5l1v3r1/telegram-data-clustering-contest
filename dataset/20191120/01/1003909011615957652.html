      <h1>Universities hand in updated free-speech policies for review by provincial government</h1>

      <p>New rules governing free speech on post-secondary campuses will soon be in place, as the province is reviewing policies drafted by all of Alberta’s 26 publicly funded institutions.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the United Conservative Party government requested the province’s colleges and universities adopt freedom of speech policies similar to that of the University of Chicago. Seen as the gold standard of free speech, the <a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FOECommitteeReport.pdf">“Chicago Principles”</a> were penned in 2014 to demonstrate a commitment to free speech on U.S. college campuses. However, the document as it stands doesn’t comply with Canadian hate-speech laws.</p>
      <p>All of the Alberta institutions met last week’s deadline to draft the policies.</p>
      <p>Advanced Education Minister Demetrios Nicolaides said Tuesday the government wants to create a strong standard for free speech that will make it clear what is welcomed and what crosses into hate speech on campus.</p>
      <p>“Nothing can occur on campus that contravenes federal law and federal definitions of hate speech, that’s why it’s important that we are robust in the development of these policies,” said Nicolaides.</p>
      <p>The minister said the Chicago Principles contain a recognition that free speech cannot violate the law, but stress that a university campus should be welcoming to all ideas, including those that make people uncomfortable or could be considered controversial.</p>
      <p>“It also includes recognition that universities have a role to play in managing and regulating free speech on campuses — obviously free-speech events cannot interfere with normal operations,” said Nicolaides. “It’s not the universities’ place to shut down discussion or an idea that is unpopular but, rather, encourage individuals to put forward alternative viewpoints.”</p>
      <p>The UCP is following in the footsteps of Ontario’s Conservative Premier Doug Ford, who requested the same thing of his province’s campuses shortly before the Alberta government’s move.</p>
      <p>Officials from both Mount Royal University and the University of Calgary declined to speak to Postmedia on Tuesday as they await approval from the government before releasing details.</p>
      <p>By Dec. 15, post-secondary institutions will receive final approval of their drafts and should then implement the policies on campus.</p>
      <p>“Implementation and compliance are up to each institution. It is a priority for us as a government that these fundamental freedoms are allowed to exist on our campuses, so I’ll be continuing to work closely with them to ensure practice is compliant with the policies outlined,” said Nicolaides.</p>
