      <p>“In view of the defendant’s  plea, the prosecuting counsel, Musa. Mela Gwani asked the court to convict and sentence the defendant.</p>
      <p>“However, the defence counsel, Shamsu A. Dauda, pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy as his client was a first time offender who has become remorseful.</p>
