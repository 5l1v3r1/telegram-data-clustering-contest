      <p>COLERAINE hurling skipper Ciaran Lagan had cause for double celebration as he led his Eoghan Rua team to Ulster junior success at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Just 24 hours before his club <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/sport/hurlingandcamogie/2019/11/19/news/coleraine-captain-ciaran-lagan-we-ll-give-all-ireland-series-a-lash-1768808/">defeated Newry Shamrocks</a> in the provincial decider, he welcomed new twin sons into the world.</p>
      <p>Odhran and Shea made their appearance at Antrim Area Hospital early on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>In what must have been the most unusual preparation for an Ulster final, Ciaran had to leave the boys’ mum, Ciara, to join his team mates for their history making game.</p>

      <p>“I was up at the hospital from about 6.30am on Friday morning and left about 10 in the evening. They were born a wee bit premature but they’re doing well,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ciaran was then able to put all the excitement of the day behind him as he focused on his role as captain and corner-back in Saturday’s final.</p>
      <p>He turned in a starring role to help his side win the Ulster title on a 1-16 to 1-11 score line.</p>

      <p>The proud dad said the new arrivals have quite big boots to fill. Their older brother Tiernan is already following in father's footsteps and playing with the Coleraine under-8s and under-10s in both football and hurling.</p>
      <p>“We’re calling them Shea and Odhran and they look to me like hurlers but they’ll have to be footballers as well, I suppose,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Eoghan Rua player added that everyone at the club was hoping the twins could continue their winning start and bring them good luck in this weekend’s All Ireland quarter final.</p>
      <p>Coleraine play British junior champions John Mitchels at Celtic Park in Derry on Sunday.</p>
