      <h1>Project Sunrise: Qantas rejects Airbus and Boeing offers for non-stop New York, London flights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:38:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.traveller.com.au/patrick-hatch-hvf90" target="_blank">Patrick Hatch</a></address>
      <p>Qantas has rejected Airbus and Boeing’s proposals for new aircraft that can fly non-stop from Sydney and Melbourne to New York and London, saying they need to lower their prices to make the business case stack up.</p>
      <p>The airline has said it will make a decision by the end of this year on whether or not to launch its so-called "Project Sunrise" flights and is looking to buy either Boeing 777-8Xs or Airbus A350-100ULRs to operate what will become the world's longest commercial flights.</p>
      <p>Airbus and Boeing had submitted their <a href="https://www.traveller.com.au/category/slug-20180225-p51tup.html">"best and final offers" on their planes</a> to Qantas in August. But Qantas said on Tuesday it had sent the aerospace giants back to Toulouse and Chicago to reconsider those offers.</p>
      <p>“We’ve asked them to go back and re-look at that, to sharpen their pencils, because there still was a gap there," Qantas International chief executive Tino La Spina told an investor briefing in Sydney on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"So we’re eagerly awaiting to see what we get back from that.”</p>
      <p>Mr La Spina said Qantas had asked the manufacturers to not just consider price, but also guarantees and conditions to deal with "what if" scenarios.</p>
      <p>“This aircraft is going to be in the fleet for the next 20 years and we want to cover off eventualities ... making sure that it’s future-proofed," he said.</p>
      <p>Qantas has talked about operating the "Sunrise" missions from 2023. However, production delays on Boeing's yet-to-fly 777-8X program could push that back.</p>
      <p>Getting the right price on new aircraft is just one piece of the puzzle in making the new long-haul routes viable.</p>
      <p>The airline says it also needs pilots to agree to a pay deal that would deliver "productivity improvements" of about 30 per cent, which are currently under negotiation.</p>
      <p>Qantas boss Alan Joyce said on Tuesday that based on <a href="https://www.traveller.com.au/category/slug-20180225-p532d8.html">media coverage of two "research flights" from New York and London</a> using Boeing 787s, there was "huge demand" for the new services, and expected the airline could demand a 30 per cent price premium over other airlines for offering a non-stop service on the routes.</p>
      <p>Air New Zealand's recent announcement it would fly from Auckland to New York also strengthened the business case for Qantas because the Australian airline needed to retain a competitive advantage on that route.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Joyce said he was not afraid to put the idea on ice if any part of the business case did not stack up and investing the hundreds of millions of dollars it would spend on new planes to grow other parts of the business.</p>
      <p>"We have to get the premium from our customers … we have to get in the position where the manufacturers contribute their contribution, we have to get the regulator on side and we have to get the pilots on side," Mr Joyce said.</p>
      <p>"I have no problem… in saying 'we gave it a good try but it didn’t work'."</p>
