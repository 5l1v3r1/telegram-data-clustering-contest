      <h3>Nov 19, 2019</h3>
      <p>For Marie Kirker, who’s looking for a market that sells fresh <b>escarole</b>, readers have a one-word answer: Smith’s. Andrea Drasner, Ann Brown, Tony Costanza and Gloria Castricone found it at separate stores. And Jan Visser said when Kirker does find it, she should cook it, shock it and freeze it in batches. He added that good substitutes are chicory, spinach or kale.</p>
      <p>For Barry Abidor, Susan Ford said <b>Nemo’s snack-size carrot cakes</b> can be found at local 7Eleven stores.</p>
      <p>For Chris Darden, who’s looking for <b>chocolate </b><b>halvah</b>, Brown found it in The Kosher Connection section of Smith’s at 2211 N. Rampart Blvd., and Rochelle Hornsby found it at the International Marketplace, 5000 S. Decatur Blvd.</p>
      <p>More on <b>cherry </b><b>preserves</b>: David Hoff was in search of Smucker’s brand, but Jim Guynup has another recommendation: Trader Joe’s. They also, he said, have some varieties with reduced sugar but no artificial sweeteners.</p>
