      <p>A box truck came barreling toward Bud and Peggy Vaught while they were being assisted by troopers on the side of the road.</p>
      <p>Illinois State Police said the driver of the truck was going too fast for road conditions and could have easily been responsible for a tragedy.</p>
      <p>A trooper pulled Peggy Vaught into a ditch, the truck sliding just inches over her.</p>
      <p>Bud Vaught was still inside the car when the truck struck their vehicle.</p>
      <p>He has some internal injuries but said he will be okay.</p>
      <p>The couple praised the work of the troopers and said they may have saved Peggy Vaught’s life by pulling her into a ditch.</p>
      <p>“All I heard was someone say ‘run.’ And that’s the last thing. I didn’t know what was going on,” Peggy Vaught said.</p>
      <p>Illinois drivers are required by law to slow down and move over if they are approaching a stopped emergency vehicle.</p>
      <p>“I mean, they jerked her out of the way and I still don’t know how she wasn’t hurt. But it hit me just flat out,” Bud Vaught said.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck was cited for driving too fast for conditions and failure to reduce speed.</p>
