      <p>QVC, Inc. ("QVC”) announced today the pricing of $435 million principal amount of new 6.250% Senior Secured Notes due 2068 (the "Notes”). QVC also granted the underwriters of this offering an option to acquire up to an additional $65.25 million principal amount of the Notes to cover any over-allotments. The Notes will be secured by a first-priority lien on the capital stock of QVC, which also secures QVC’s existing secured indebtedness and certain future indebtedness. The net proceeds from the offering are expected to be used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under QVC’s senior secured credit facility. QVC’s senior secured credit facility is used for working capital purposes and, among other things, may be used for the repayment of other debt and the payment of dividends to Qurate Retail, Inc. for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of its common stock. The offering is expected to close on or about November 26, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. QVC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, Inc. (Nasdaq: QRTEA and QRTEB).</p>
      <p>QVC intends to apply to list the Notes on the New York Stock Exchange. If the application is approved, QVC expects trading in the Notes to begin within 30 days after the Notes are first issued.</p>
