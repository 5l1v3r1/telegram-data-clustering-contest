      <p>A few days after being enlisted for CashMoneyAP’s new release <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/rich-the-kid-cashmoneyap-all-i-know-stunna-4-vegas-stream">“All I Know,”</a> DaBaby and Billion Dollar Baby Entertainment affiliate <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/stunna-4-vegas">Stunna 4 Vegas</a> is introducing his latest single, “Long.” The young North Carolina rapper’s new track features production from Yung Glizzy, and is reportedly one of the songs that makes up his next major studio project <i>Rich</i> <i>Youngin</i>. “Long” is also being released alongside its accompanying visual, which was put together by the Billion Dollar Baby Entertainment crew’s go-to music-video directors, Reel Goats.</p>
      <p>“I really make music … I’m not just rapping. I’m not just saying anything, I’m saying what’s going on every day around me. I’m talking shit that’s gon’ make you feel me. It’s substance. I ain’t one of them rappers that just go in there and start rapping. It’s a meaning behind any song I’ve made … When I do record, I just record. I’m not recording thinking about the project like that. I’m just recording,” Stunna 4 Vegas recently explained to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8510899/stunna-4-vegas-interview-dababy-interscope"><i>Billboard</i></a>, sharing some insight into his creative process and breaking down his approach to putting albums together. “I could drop another tape right now if I wanted to. When I work, I just work, bro. I’ll make five songs in a two-three hour session and then come back in two-three days and do the same thing. I really like recording and now I got it even more perfect now that I’ve signed and I got big racks and I got jewelry and all, it just turns me up. Like when I left Johnnys I just wanted to go record, I had some more stuff to rap about.”</p>
