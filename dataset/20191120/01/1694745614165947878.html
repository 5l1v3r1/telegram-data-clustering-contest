      <h1>Emilia Clarke on Shooting Game of Thrones Nude Scenes: "It Was Definitely Hard"</h1>

      <p>Emilia Clarke says she felt pressured to do nude scenes after <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Game-of-Thrones"><b>Game of Thrones</b></a>. During an interview with Dax Shepard for his podcast <b>Armchair Expert</b> on Nov. 18, the actress revealed that the frequent onscreen nudity <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/">wasn't always something she felt comfortable with</a>. "I'm a lot more savvy with what I'm comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing," Clarke told Shepard. "I've had fights on set before where I'm like, 'No, the sheet stays up,' and they're like, 'You don't wanna disappoint your <b>Game of Thrones</b> fans,' and I'm like, 'F*ck you.'"</p>
      <p>Clarke notes that season one of the show featured a "f*ck-ton of nudity," which was very new to her. "I'd been on a film set twice before then," Clarke explained, referring to the 2009 British medical soap opera <b>Doctors</b> and the 2010 sci-fi TV film <b>Triassic Attack</b>. "I'm now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don't know what I'm meant to do and I don't know what's expected of me, and I don't know what you want and I don't know what I want." But her costar Jason Momoa, aka <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Game-Thrones-Theory-Drogon-Khal-Drogo-46039341">Khal Drogo</a>, helped her become more confident in speaking up for herself. "It was definitely hard," she said. "Which is why the scenes, when I got to do them with Jason, were wonderful, because he was like, 'No, sweetie, this isn't okay."</p>
