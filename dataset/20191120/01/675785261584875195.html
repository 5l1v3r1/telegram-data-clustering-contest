      <h2>The north London club announced they had parted company with Pochettino on Tuesday following a poor run of form which saw them drop to 14th in the Premier League</h2>

      <p>Tottenham cult hero Ossie Ardiles left a long message of support for his fellow countryman Mauricio Pochettino following his sacking by the club on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Spurs look set to replace the Argentinean with Jose Mourinho after it was announced on Tuesday that Pochettino would be leaving the club he has been at since 2014.</p>
      <p>Ardiles and Pochettino were known to have a good relationship, and Ardiles- who won the FA Cup and UEFA Cup during his time as a player at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/osvaldooardiles">tweeted</a> saying: "One glorious chapter in our club history has come to an end today.</p>
      <p>"From my part I would like to say a big big thank you to Mauricio for everything he has done at our club. These 5 years have been a roller coaster of a ride. In extremely difficult cirunstances (Leaving our beloved White Hart Lane- Who can forget The Finale- playing at Wembley, etc Mauricio put us in the elite of World football.</p>

      <p>"We owe him so many memories. Where to start? With him we learned to 'believe'. Everybody at Spurs owe him so much. It was such a pleasure to arrive in the Training ground and witness the camaraderie, the atmosphere there. From everybody. From my personal point of view, life gave me a wonderful present. Unique. His friendship. The friendship of a wonderful, principled man that would last forever.</p>

      <p>"Mauricio, my friend, have a very good and deserved rest and come back to football (Football need people like you) revitalised, refresh. And, of course, we meet again... On behalf of everybody at Spurs (and I know I talk for everybody)... THANK YOU!!! And of course, COYS!!!"</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Spurs will have appointed a new manager before their next game, a London derby against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
