      <p>Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/live-blog/nov-19-impeachment-hearings-live-updates-n1085171/ncrd1086396#liveBlogHeader">shared his grievances</a> with House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) during Tuesday's public hearing, saying it upsets him when Schiff accuses Republicans of trying to out the whistleblower whose complaint about President Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sparked the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>It is "unfair for you to make that accusation," Conaway told Schiff. The whistleblower does not deserve an "absolute right" to anonymity, he added, and Republicans must know this person's identity. "This is about leveling the playing field between our two teams," Conaway said. "Your team knows the whistleblower, they have intimate knowledge of who he or she is."</p>
      <p>Conaway also brought up a letter Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/92219">sent to colleagues</a> on Sept. 22, in which she discussed the whistleblower speaking to Congress. Schiff responded by saying he was happy to enter into the record the statute that allows whistleblowers to remain anonymous and Rep. Devin Nunes' (R-Calif.) past remarks about the importance of providing anonymity to whistleblowers.</p>
