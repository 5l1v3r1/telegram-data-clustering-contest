      <p>After a 376-day absence, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1975/carmelo-anthony">Carmelo Anthony</a> returned to the NBA, starting for the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/por/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> on Tuesday against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a>. Anthony was <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28115048/trail-blazers-activate-carmelo-anthony-wear-no-00">wearing the unfamiliar No. 00</a> -- No. 15 is retired in Portland for Larry Steele, and No. 7 has been held out of circulation since Brandon Roy last wore it in 2011 -- but the sight of Anthony on an NBA court was enough to get his friends and colleagues from around the association excited on social media.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the first player to tweet about Anthony's comeback was longtime friend and fellow draft class of 2003 member <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a>, hours before he took the court for his own game Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The recently retired Dwyane Wade, who was drafted two spots after Anthony in 2003, needed just one word -- with a few extra Os, perhaps to represent Anthony's new number -- to express his excitement.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3102530/jusuf-nurkic">Jusuf Nurkic</a>, still out rehabbing his leg injury, was ready to watch his newest teammate go to work.</p>

      <p>The rest of the NBA was equally excited to see how Anthony would look after a year away.</p>
