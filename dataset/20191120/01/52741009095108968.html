      <p>NEW WESTMINSTER, B.C. — A British Columbia man who murdered a Belgian tourist has been sentenced to life in prison with no chance of parole for at least 23 years.</p>
      <p>Sean McKenzie, who is 27, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Amelie Sakkalis in September.</p>
      <p>Sakkalis' body was found near Highway 1, north of Boston Bar, in August 2018.</p>
      <p>Police said last year they believe Sakkalis was hitchhiking from the Penticton area toward Vancouver on the day she was killed.</p>
      <p>Police arrested McKenzie, a resident of Oliver, B.C., at the scene of the crime.</p>
      <p>He was initially charged with first-degree murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge.</p>
      <p>Police said McKenzie had no criminal record, and was known to travel extensively through B.C. for work.</p>
      <p>As a part of his sentencing on Tuesday, a judge also ordered McKenzie to provide a DNA sample, and handed him a lifetime firearms prohibition.</p>
      <p>He will be included on the federal sex offender registry. (CTV Vancouver)</p>
