      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>The Irish News, Friday November 20 2009: Trap not confident of replay</p>
      <p>Giovanni Trapattoni last night backed the FAI’s demand for a replay against World Cup play-off opponents France but was pessimistic about the outcome.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland manager hoped that pressure would be brought to bear on France and FIFA, but was more hopeful about the future following William Gallas’s illegal goal in Paris on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if France can [offer a replay],” said Trapattoni.</p>
      <p>“But it is FIFA who must clarify whether it is possible or not. It is a difficult situation. It is not only France, it’s also FIFA. Maybe we can change the rules, but obviously I don’t believe this will happen, but I hope for the future that things will change."</p>
      <p>Trapattoni, whose Italy team was hard done by during the 2002 World Cup finals, would like to see video replays being used for controversial incidents.</p>
      <p>“I think this is good pressure on FIFA. We need to change these old rules. There is great interest around football. In society, things change. I think football has to change too."</p>
      <p>He added: “Football loses credibility. It’s about establishing a new era. There are so many interests around football, commercial interests.”</p>
