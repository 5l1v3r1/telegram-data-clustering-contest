      <h1>Lil Nas X, not Taylor Swift? New artists dominate Grammy noms</h1>
      <h2>Billie Eilish, Lizzo also first-time nominees</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:15:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Respers France, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - The Grammys are by nature built to cause arguments among music lovers.</p>
      <p>Honestly, some people still aren't over Herbie Hancock besting Amy Winehouse for album of the year back in 2008 (he took home the trophy for "River: The Joni Letters," his album of Joni Mitchell interpretations.)</p>
      <p>Look for the Swifties to be in an uproar this year, even before the Grammys take place.</p>
      <p>That's because Taylor Swift only received three nominations on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Her hugely popular "Lover" album was passed over for album of the year, though the title track is nominated for song of the year.</p>
      <p>Instead "I,I" by Bon Iver; "Norman F***ing Rockwell" by Lana Del Rey; "When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go" by Billie Eilish; "Thank U, Next" by Ariana Grande; "I Used to Know Her" by H.E.R.; "7" by Lil Nas X; "Cuz I Love You" by Lizzo and "Father of the Bride" by Vampire Weekend will vie for best album.</p>
      <p>That's a pretty fresh list for the top category given that three of those artists -- Lil Nas X, Billie Eilish and Lizzo -- are first-time nominees.</p>
      <p>The Grammys have long been accused of not keeping up with the times and "playing it safe" by honoring the tried and true artists in the industry.</p>
      <p>But this year it appears to be mostly about the new blood, with some of the more established performers actually being snubbed.</p>
      <p>For example, the legendary Bruce Springsteen had a big year with the release of his live album "Springsteen on Broadway," as well as his 19th studio album "Western Stars," and yet he failed to receive any Grammy noms.</p>
      <p>Maren Morris is not as seasoned an artist as Springsteen, but she, too, had a major year, culminating in six Country Music Association nominations and a win for album of the year at the recent event.</p>
      <p>She's received a single Grammy nomination for best country duo/group performance for the song "Common," which features fellow country star Brandi Carlile.</p>
      <p>Former Grammy favorite Ed Sheeran only scored one nomination for best pop vocal album, where he'll compete with all women, including Grammy darling Beyonc√©.</p>
      <p>Speaking of Bey, she received four nominations, including best pop solo performance for her single "Spirit" off her "The Lion King: The Gift" album.</p>
      <p>One newcomer who didn't receive any love is rapper Megan Thee Stallion.</p>
      <p>The artist who had everyone declaring it was a "Hot Girl Summer" was thought to be a favorite for best new artist, but she was was completely shut out of the nominations.</p>
