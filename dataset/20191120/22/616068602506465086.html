      <p>It was arguably their best 60 minute effort of the season.</p>
      <p>The Kelowna Rockets were good from start to finish Wednesday, beating the visiting Victoria Royals 4-1 before nearly 4,700 fans at Prospera Place.</p>
      <p>Kaeden Korczak led the way with a goal and an assist. Defence partner Jake Lee also scored, as did Michael Farren and the red hot Alex Swetlikoff.</p>
      <p>"I think things are starting to click together," said Farren.</p>
      <p>"We had a good week of practice, and we kind of moved some lines around. I think everyone is kind of gelling nicely."</p>
      <p>The end result Wednesday, and last Saturday's upset of the Kamloops Blazers was a far cry from the previous four games when miscues inside their own blueline led to far too many Grade A scoring chances and far too many goals.</p>
      <p>Korczak opened the scoring late in the first. Farren faked a shot from the left circle, slid the puck to Korczak, who found some space before ringing a shot off the post and past a screened Brock Gould.</p>
      <p>"Our first goal was something we worked on all week," said head coach Adam Foote.</p>
      <p>"Farren made a great play and kicked it out to Korczak, and gave Korczak time and space. It worked, so I think the players, when they saw that happen jumped on board. They were pretty excited on the bench.</p>
      <p>Lee doubled the lead early in the second. He pinched in from the left point, intercepted a clearing attempt, circled the net and beat Gould with a wrap around to the far side.</p>
      <p>Swetlikoff bagged his fifth in seven games with a rising wrist shot from the right faceoff circle to make it 3-0. Farren closed out the Rockets scoring late in the second on a breakaway after Korczak sprung him with a textbook stretch pass from his own blue line.</p>
      <p>Roman Basran lost his shutout bid midway through the third. Royal's forward Sean Gulka and two Rockets battled for the puck through the slot, got tangled and crashed into the Kelowna netminder. The impact knocked the net off its supports as the puck slid into the net.</p>
      <p>After a lengthy video review, the goal stood.</p>
      <p>Foote said the back end played the best game it has all season as a group.</p>
      <p>As a whole, Foote said the team outworked a Victoria team that prides itself on hard work.</p>
      <p>The Rockets, winners of two straight, moved into a second place tie with the idle Vancouver Giants in the BC Division.</p>
      <p>Kelowna now hit the road for games Friday in Seattle and Saturday in Tri-City before hosting the Central Division leading Edmonton Oil Kings next Tuesday.</p>
