      <h1>Ryan Giggs' critics told to "eat their words" after leading Wales to Euro 2020</h1>
      <h2>Giggs will take his side to next summer's European Championship finals, and midfielder Joe Allen has rounded on critics of the Manchester United legend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Giggs has made his critics “eat their words” according to Wales hero Joe Allen.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Allen returned from suspension to help Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to clinch second spot in Group E and automatic qualification to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>It sparked wild celebrations in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> and left highly-decorated ex-Manchester United star Giggs acclaiming one of the best days of his life.</p>
      <p>Allen says the rookie Wales boss has been widely doubted and questioned following his appointment as Chris Coleman’s successor in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Some supporters have not forgiven Giggs for his perceived lack of commitment to Wales as a United player when he missed 30 out of 40 friendlies.</p>
      <p>But Allen reckons even Giggs’ fiercest detractors must now acknowledge he has done well getting Wales back to the Euros.</p>

      <p>Allen said: “The ambition and target was to get to the Euros. He has done the job. Any way you get there is huge success.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of people are going to have to eat their words with some of the criticism which has been thrown at us.</p>
      <p>“He has delivered, simple as that. He came in off the back of a great manager who had huge success. It was always going to be tough but he has got us there.</p>
      <p>“I think questions have been asked of everything really – selection, tactics - but nine times out of ten he has got it right. That is one of the big reasons we have made it.</p>

      <p>“I think if you have the ability, whether as a player or one of the staff , you have to back yourself and give 100 percent.</p>
      <p>“That is all you can do and reap the rewards, which is what we have all done.”</p>
      <p>Wales had a play-off spot in the bag from their Nations League form. But their hopes of automatic qualification were badly hit in the summer by back-to-back losses in Croatia and Hungary.</p>
      <p>Yet they have responded since with an unbeaten run which yielded 11 points from a possible 15.</p>

      <p>Giggs changed his tactics to achieve it too as he ditched his passing out from the back philosophy in favour a more direct approach utilising 6ft 5in targetman Kieffer Moore.</p>
      <p>The Wigan striker, who only made his competitive debut last month, enabled Wales to win the ball higher up the pitch and bring skillful stars like Gareth Bale, Dan James, Aaron Ramsey and Harry Wilson into play.</p>
      <p>Now Allen believes Wales could have an even better squad with more attacking quality compared to four years ago when they reached the last four of Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>Allen added: “We’ve got players that can hurt any team. I don’t think we’ll be so much of a surprise package at this Euros for other teams. But we’ll go out there and give it all guns blazing.</p>
      <p>“We have lost big players but the young lads and the other lads who have come in have stepped up to the plate.</p>
      <p>“To a man everyone who has played in this campaign has done their part and done really well. I am excited.”</p>
