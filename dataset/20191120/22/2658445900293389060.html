      <p>Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has accused the Federal; Government of resorting “to force rather than dialogue” in its drive to put university teachers on a central payroll system.</p>
      <p>The Federal Government has announced that lecturers will commence enrolment on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS) from next week.</p>
      <p>Accountant General of the Federation Ahmed Idris in an advertorial, said University teachers will be captured on the payroll between November 25 and December 7.</p>
      <p>Repeated calls and WhatsApp messages to ASUU National President, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi seeking to know if the Union would participate in the IPPIS remained unanswered last night.</p>
      <p>However, ASUU Chairman, University of Ibadan chapter, Prof. Deji Omole, described the imposition of the IPPIS as breaking laws that allow for university autonomy.</p>

      <p>Omole said the Federal Government should negotiate with the union to discuss the grey areas of the IPPIS policy instead of issuing a directive.</p>
      <p>He accused the government of im[posing the IPPIS on the teachers. He described it as breaking laws that allow for university autonomy.</p>
      <p>Prof. Omole said: “The government’s pronouncement to forcefully enroll university workers is an act of violence against the university system.  It is worrisome for a government under democratic dispensation to resort to force rather than dialogue.  If not why is the government afraid of negotiations? We are not perturbed by the directive. A government claiming to be fighting corruption should not break the law.</p>
      <p>“The university Autonomy Act is very clear on university administrators.  There is no greater corruption than those breaking the law of the land.  Breaking of existing laws with impunity is the greatest corruption anywhere in the world. We refused to be harassed or intimidated. We are not strangers in this country. We are veritable stakeholders.  We have told them what to do. Let the government come back to negotiation table and let’s discuss the grey areas. Forceful enlistment will not solve the problem. We are not disturbed but we are worried; government is getting dictatorial.  A supposedly democratic government is getting dictatorial.”</p>
