      <p>The firm’s first residential development inside the estate, the 18-hectare Arden Botanical Village will be offering 329 lots ranging from 280 to 609 square meters each.</p>
      <p>Lot prices in Arden Botanical Village range from ₱18,000 to ₱22,000 per square meter. The village is expected for completion in 2024.</p>
      <p>Designed by renowned Filipino landscape architect and environmental planner Paulo Alcazaren, the exclusively gated Arden Botanical Village will be highlighted by the Centrera Park, which is surrounded by natural groves of mature trees, natural waterways and ponds, sprawling lush greeneries, expansive open spaces, promenades and parks, and jogging paths.</p>
      <p>The village’s Clubhouse will also be part of the Centrera Park, with some carefully curated amenities for the exclusive use of the residents and their guests.</p>
      <p>A natural swimming pool will be part of the amenities and village landscape, a trend that has gained popularity in European neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>“Arden Botanical Village will be built around the natural features that thrive in the estate, providing purposeful, livable spaces for its residents,” said Eugene Megaworld First Vice President for Sales and Marketing Em Lozano.</p>
      <p>He noted that, “because the location is naturally gifted with greeneries that couldn’t be found in any other residential villages, we want to preserve and highlight them in our development.”</p>
      <p>Taking inspiration from Scandinavian architecture, Arden Botanical Village will also feature thematic bridges, landscaped walkways, bike lanes, and some interactive water features.</p>
      <p>Houses and village amenities, including the village showroom, will feature minimalist form and clean lines with panoramic windows that look out, and make a pleasant contrast with the village’s verdant landscape.</p>
