      <p>Hong Kong businessman Alex Yeung has been repatriated after being investigated for allegedly organising a gathering without a permit last month.</p>
      <p>The gathering, organised on 11 Oct, was intended for people of Chinese ethnicity living in Singapore to share their views on the current protests in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The Singapore Police Force (SPF) <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/alex-yeung-repatriated-hong-kong-protests-public-assembly-12111884">told</a> <i>CNA </i>late Wed (20 Nov) that Yeung will also be banned from re-entering Singapore without prior permission from the authorities.</p>
      <p>Police said earlier this month on 7 Nov that Yeung was “neither arrested nor in Police custody”. However, his passport was impounded for the time being.</p>
      <p>Police also noted that while the event was initially <a href="https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2019/11/08/hong-kong-restaurant-owner-under-investigation-for-allegedly-organising-event-in-singapore-regarding-hk-protests/">held</a> at Kimoto Gastro Bar, located at The Sail @ Marina Bay, it was shifted “after some time” to the public space in the vicinity of The Promontory at Marina Boulevard.</p>
      <p>“The Police would like to remind the public that organising or participating in a public assembly without a Police permit in Singapore is illegal and constitutes an offence under the Public Order Act.</p>
      <p>“The Police will not grant any permit for assemblies that advocate political causes of other countries. Foreigners visiting or living in Singapore should abide by our laws,” SPF warned.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Yeung previously expressed intention to purchase “second home”, set up a restaurant in S’pore</b>
      </p>
      <p>A staunch supporter of the Hong Kong police and the establishment, and allegedly pro-Beijing, Yeung accused young students in Hong Kong of being paid to attend anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>The owner of a YouTube channel called Wah Kee Positive Energy, with currently around 150,000 subscribers, also expressed his respect for the city’s police force in making Hong Kong what used to be one of the safest areas in the world for many years prior to the protests.</p>
      <p>Citing security concerns as a result of the unrest in Hong Kong, Yeung had previously raised the prospect of buying a “second home” in Singapore.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Cantonese about his visit to Singapore in a video published on 4 Nov, Yeung said: “Doing business in Hong Kong is tough, so I came to Singapore to see if I may set up a restaurant here and arranged to meet some people… make some investment here to set up a company.”</p>
      <p>“Business is bad and every month, my company is losing money. I have never thought of breaking any law here or getting involved in politics.</p>
      <p>“I am not a politician, I am just a businessman. I am here to look for business opportunities. It is that simple. This has to be very clear,” he reiterated.</p>
