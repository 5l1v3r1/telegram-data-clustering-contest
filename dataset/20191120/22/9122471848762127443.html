      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa Has A Message For Alabama Fans Before Saturday’s Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:19:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Over the weekend, Tua Tagovailoa suffered a gruesome season-ending injury. The Alabama star quarterback dislocated his hip and suffered a fracture during the team’s game against Mississippi State.</p>
      <p>Initial reports suggested Tua’s playing career could be in jeopardy. However, after he underwent surgery, doctors announced he is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>He won’t play for the rest of the season and likely won’t play for Alabama ever again. However, he still has love for the university and its fans.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa had a message for fans before Saturday afternoon’s game against Western Carolina.</p>
      <p>“Hoping to see everyone this Saturday to support the team for senior day at BDS! See you Saturday Alabama football. ROLL TIDE,” Tua said.</p>

      <p>With Tua out, the Tide turn to backup quarterback Mac Jones. The former three-star recruit is completing nearly 70-percent of his passes and has four touchdowns passes to just one interception.</p>
      <p>Jones will have an easy test this weekend before a huge road game against in-state rival Auburn. The Tigers boast one of the best defenses in college football, led by standout defensive lineman Derrick Brown.</p>
      <p>Alabama will enter the game against Auburn as a <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/alabama-crimson-tide/betting-line-alabama-auburn-tua-tagovailoa">2.5-point favorite</a> with Mac Jones under center.</p>
