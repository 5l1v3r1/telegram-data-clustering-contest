        <b>The hunt is on for a new president of the University of Technology, Jamaica (UTech).</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement this afternoon, the university announced that ​incumbent, Professor Stephen Vasciannie has indicated that for personal and professional reasons he will not renew his contract when it expires on December 31.</p>
      <p>However, Pro Chancellor Richard Powell said Vasciannie has offered to extend his tenure to support the transitional arrangements for his succession. </p>
      <p>"The Council is grateful that Professor Vasciannie had accepted the invitation to take on the mantle of leadership at UTech, Jamaica during this season of its evolution," Powell said.</p>

      <p>Powell also said Vasciannie made a significant contribution during his three-year tenure, achieving, among other things, institutional accreditation and launching the University of Technology, Jamaica Press.</p>
      <p>He said the president also demonstrated a strong student-centred approach and leadership in strengthening teaching, research and service.</p>
      <p>"These and other important initiatives have served to strengthen the University’s institutional capacity and brand, as well as enhanced the value of the university’s offerings," said Powell in a statement.</p>
