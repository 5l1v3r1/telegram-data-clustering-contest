        <li>Champion swimmer’s doping case being heard by Cas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of Olympic swimming champion Sun Yang’s drug testers was a construction worker with no anti-doping training or experience, according to fresh claims.</p>
      <p>The controversial Chinese star has been appearing before a Court of Arbitration for Sport hearing in Geneva after the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed a Fina decision not to sanction him for his part in smashing a vial of blood during a test at his home in 2018.</p>
      <p>He faces a potential ban of up to eight years, which would rule him out of next year’s Tokyo Olympics if he loses the case after serving a suspension in 2014 for taking the stimulant trimetazidine.</p>
      <p>Sun has already told the hearing three officials who turned up to conduct the out-of-competition test in September last year could not prove their identity. Wada has denied that claim and the Cas panel has retired to consider its findings.</p>
      <p>Now, however, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/sport/sun-yang-s-lawyers-want-cas-to-consider-builder-s-explosive-testimony-20191120-p53chd.html">according to the Sydney Morning Herald</a> citing Chinese state media, reports have surfaced that one of Sun’s testers was a builder with no anti-doping qualifications and only at the scene to help a friend.</p>
      <p>He is also said to have admitted taking photos and videos of Sun. They were later deleted but are strictly forbidden for chaperones during testing missions.</p>
      <p>“I knew nothing about the doping test and nothing about my role that night. I just came to help my middle school classmate at her request. I am a builder,” the man was quoted as saying by state media outlet Xinhua.</p>
      <p>“I am a builder and I am always busy at work, day and night. No one ever trained me about the doping test and it is unnecessary for me to undertake such training.”</p>
      <p>The report claims Sun challenged the alleged ring-in tester to produce his credentials and when he could not, demanded that he leave.</p>
      <p>Sun won two golds at the 2012 Olympics and another in 2016, and the case has attracted huge interest in his homeland.</p>
      <p>Fina found the 27-year-old questioned the credentials of testers before members of his entourage smashed the blood sample vials with a hammer. He has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Sun competed at this year’s world championships in South Korea under the shadow of the appeal and rivals, including Australian star Mack Horton, snubbed him after races.</p>
