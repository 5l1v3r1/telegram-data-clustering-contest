      <p>A prominent rights activist was shot dead in Somalia's capital Mogadishu on Wednesday, with security officials suggesting she had been hit by a stray bullet.</p>
      <p>Almaas Elman Ali, who came from a leading family of peace campaigners, was travelling by car inside the heavily fortified airport compound when she was hit.</p>
      <p>"She was riding in a car along a road inside the airport," said Mohamed Omar, a Somali security official. "A stray bullet hit her, and she died within a few minutes."</p>
      <p>Gunfire is a regular occurence in Mogadishu, although the levels of violence are far lower than in past years of heavy conflict.</p>
      <p>"There was not any gunfire in the airport, or in nearby areas before the incident occurred," Omar said.</p>
      <p>The sprawling airport complex includes embassies and the headquarters of African Union soldiers.</p>
      <p>Almaas Elman Ali, who had dual Somali and Canadian citizen, is believed to have been attending a meeting for the Elman Peace centre, founded in 1990 by her father, Elman Ali Ahmed.</p>
      <p>Ahmed's wife and daughters - including Almaas - fled to Canada as the civil war in the country worsened. He stayed in Somalia and in 1996 was killed in Mogadishu by unknown gunmen.</p>
      <p>The family rest of the family had returned to Somalia in recent years to help run the peace centre working to end the violence.</p>
      <p>Their work includes a programme called "Drop the Gun, Pick Up the Pen" that encourages child soldiers conscripted by militia gunmen to return to peace.</p>
      <p>Almaas' sister, youth activist Ilwad Elmam, was among those shortlisted to win the Nobel Peace Prize this year by The Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO).</p>
      <p>Although Somalia is slowly rebuilding after years of devastating conflict, it suffers regular bombing and assaults claimed by the jihadist insurgents, Al-Shabaab.</p>
      <p>They were driven out of Mogadishu by government forces backed by 20,000 African Union peacekeepers in 2011.</p>
      <p>But they still carry out attacks including suicide bombings against government and international targets.</p>
