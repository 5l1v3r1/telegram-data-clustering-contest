      <p>As James laughs, Kanye continues: "It's more than cool, it's more than cool as hell or something, it's heavenly, it's great, it's magnificent, and God is using me as a human being.</p>
      <p>"You know, as humbly as I can put it, he's using me to show off. Last year, I made $115million and still ended up $35million in debt.</p>

      <p>"This year, I looked up and I just got $68million returned to me on my tax returns and people say, 'Don't talk about these numbers', but people need to hear someone that has been put into debt by the system talk about these kind of numbers now they're in service to Christ."</p>
