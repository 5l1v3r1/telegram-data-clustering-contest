      <h1>Joel Klatt Argues Why Ohio State Is Superior To LSU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:21:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>The top three of the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-12">College Football Playoff rankings</a> remain static with last night’s release. LSU is still No. 1, followed by Ohio State and Clemson.</p>
      <p>It is hard to argue those top three undefeated Power Five teams being atop the rankings. You can have a pretty interesting debate over whether or not their positions are appropriate as of now.</p>
      <p>LSU has what most accept as the best resume, with wins over Texas, Florida, Auburn, and Alabama, a group that is pretty hard to match. Ohio State’s wins against current ranked teams are Cincinnati and Wisconsin, though they will bolster that strength of schedule in a major way to end the year, with Penn State and Michigan.</p>
      <p>FS1’s Joel Klatt went on <i>The Herd </i>today, and was pretty passionate about Ohio State over LSU for the No. 1 spot.</p>

      <p>Klatt on LSU vs. Ohio State, <a href="https://saturdaytradition.com/ohio-state-football/balance-and-dominance-of-ohio-state-should-trump-lsu-in-rankings-joel-klatt-argues/">via Saturday Tradition</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Putting them at No. 1 just because, I think, is nonsense,” Klatt said of LSU’s ranking. “In particular when you look at the balance and dominance of Ohio State and Clemson. I think Ohio State, by the way, in the next three weeks if they are to win all three games is gonna have even a stronger resumé than LSU. They will have win over five currently ranked teams. If they’re the B1G champ and undefeated, that would be a better resumé than even LSU with a win against Alabama. I really still think Ohio State could be the No. 1 team in the Playoff rankings.”</blockquote>
      <p>LSU has the best wins, but Clemson and Ohio State have definitely looked like the more balance teams, especially in recent weeks. Ed Orgeron’s team can win a shootout with anyone, but they’ve had some less-than-encouraging defensive performances against teams like Vanderbilt and Ole Miss this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28099946/sp+-rankings-week-12-battle-1-loss-teams">ESPN’s SP+</a> ranks team efficiency, and has Ohio State at No. 1, with the No. 4 offense and nation’s best defense. Clemson is No. 4 overall, with the No. 6 offense and No. 3 defense.</p>
      <p>LSU has a much wider gap, with the second-best offense behind Oklahoma, but the No. 29 defense.</p>
