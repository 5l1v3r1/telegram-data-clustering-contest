      <p>Tupac Shakur has been filmed talking on his phone while wandering outside, conspiracists claim.</p>
      <p>The US rapper was murdered in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, US, on September 13, 1996.</p>
      <p>But conspiracy theories have circulated ever since wildly claiming that the California Love star survived the shooting and went into hiding.</p>
      <p>Various supposed sightings of the legendary rapper, as well as mysterious prison records, have all been used as "evidence" a cover-up was in place.</p>
      <p>And in a new explosive clip, a man who bears a striking resemblance to Tupac has been filmed walking around outside.</p>
      <p>The footage, captured by a cameraman who attempts to remain hidden, recorded the man talking on his phone.</p>

      <p>He is seen sporting similar facial hair and a bald head.</p>
      <p>The footage captured the lookalike shooting a smile, while seemingly smoking and drinking a canned drink.</p>
      <p>After being uploaded to YouTube, captioned: "A video Of Tupac alive in 2019, age 48."</p>
      <p>Hundreds have since flooded in to watch the bizarre clip.</p>
      <p>One person said: "Pac has risen. Hallelujah."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Probably the best lookalike out there same head shape teeth even scar on top right from holes in the quad studio."</p>

      <p>However, not everyone believed the clip was legitimate.</p>
      <p>Another person added: "Stop it bro, you're hilarious."</p>
      <p>Tupac is not the only celeb who has been claimed to have staged his death.</p>
      <p>Many people believe Elvis Presley faked his death in order to shy away from the limelight.</p>
      <p>Only weeks ago, the singer was "pictured alive" some 20 years after his death.</p>
