      <p>CHICAGO - The Latest on legal battle between city of Chicago and Jussie Smollett (all times local):</p>
      <p>4:15 p.m.</p>
      <p>Chicago will continue in its efforts to recover the cost of the investigation into claims by former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack.</p>
      <p>Chicago police say the alleged attack on Smollett was staged, and he was charged with making a false report. Prosecutors dropped the case in March.</p>
      <p>Smollett’s attorneys this week claimed the actor’s $10,000 payment after the close of a criminal case should prevent Chicago from seeking reimbursement for a police investigation. On Tuesday, they filed a counterclaim against the city, accusing Chicago of malicious prosecution that caused humiliation and extreme distress.</p>
      <p>Bill McCaffrey, the spokesman for Chicago’s law department, says the presiding judge has already ruled in the city’s favour and that officials “expect to be successful in defeating these counterclaims.”</p>

      <p>Former “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett says his $10,000 payment after the close of a criminal case should prevent Chicago from seeking reimbursement for a police investigation of his claim that he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack.</p>
      <p>Smollett’s attorneys filed a response Tuesday to Chicago’s lawsuit in federal court. They also filed a counterclaim against the city, saying Smollett was the victim of a malicious prosecution that caused humiliation and extreme distress.</p>
      <p>Smollett told police he was beaten in January by two men who looped a noose around his neck. Chicago police said it was staged, and Smollett was charged with making a false report.</p>
      <p>But prosecutors in March dropped the case. Smollett maintains his innocence but agreed to let authorities keep a $10,000 bail</p>
