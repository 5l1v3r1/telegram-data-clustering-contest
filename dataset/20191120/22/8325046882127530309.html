      <p>Ten candidates have qualified for tonight’s fifth Democratic primary debate on November 20, which will be hosted by MSNBC and the Washington Post in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
      <p>In order to qualify for the November debate, candidates needed both 165,000 individual donors and to earn either 3% in four DNC-approved national polls or 5% in two approved early-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.</p>
      <p>Polls released between September 13 and November 13 – the week before the debate – counted towards qualification.</p>
      <p>So far, ten candidates have met both requirements, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dHSFg0jrAeIAqDlFZqAu-5N2x-wk8PT-6H4DbCendUM/edit#gid=900260735">according to Politico’s Democratic primary poll tracker.</a></p>
      <p>But the stricter polling requirements leaft some mid-tier candidates who easily qualified for the September and October debates completely off the stage.</p>
      <p>Former Rep. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-beto-orourke-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Beto O’Rourke</a> dropped out of the race on November 1 after failing to qualify for the November debate and former HUD Secretary <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-julian-castro-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Julian Castro</a> attained zero polls, meaning he’ll also miss the stage. Castro recently <a href="https://time.com/5706272/julian-castro-2020-fundraising/">threatened to drop out of the race altogether</a> if he doesn’t raise $800,000 by Halloween.</p>
