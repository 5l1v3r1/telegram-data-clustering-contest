      <p>A teaser from the two megastars of Tamil cinema, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kamal-haasan/">Kamal Haasan</a>, on Tuesday, of a possible political blockbuster, has created a stir in the state. Though both have punctuated their statement about “joining hands” with several caveats, the idea has the potential to turn the assembly election slated for 2021 into a gripping show. A Rajini-Kamal joint entry is likely to add fizz to the campaign, which, in the absence of AIADMK supremo J <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jayalalithaa">Jayalalithaa</a> and DMK patriarch M <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/research/muthuvel-karunanidhi-from-failing-class-x-to-scripting-the-history-of-modern-tamil-nadu/">Karunanidhi</a>, is predicted to be a boring affair.</p>
      <p>So far, the ageing superstars have had limited traction in Tamil Nadu even though they announced their entry in electoral politics some time ago. Even as Rajinikanth said he was preparing for the next assembly election and skipped the May general election, Kamal Haasan’s <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-does-makkal-needhi-maiam-mean-kamal-haasan-new-party-name-symbol-flag-5073149/">Makkal Needhi Maiam</a> (MNM) contested all the Lok Sabha constituencies in the state. MNM candidates lost their deposits in all the seats and a number of its candidates finished third behind DMK and AIADMK in urban constituencies.</p>
      <p>The two actor-politicians have so far been vague about ideology, while offering issue-centric responses, and talking in general terms about the need to do good for the state. But neither of them has rejected the political paradigm and the goals the Dravidian Movement set in the 1950s and ‘60s, among them social justice and Tamil pride. However, there has been speculation that the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> may align with Rajinikanth and that the latter could be projected as the face of a non-Dravidian political coalition.</p>
      <p>While voter fatigue threatens the prospects of the AIADMK and DMK, Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan will have to offer a clear and coherent political agenda to emerge as an alternative. To begin with, the two men will have to agree on core issues — Rajinikanth welcomed the abrogation of <a href="https://www.indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-article-370-has-not-been-scrapped-but-kashmirs-special-status-has-gone-5880390/">Article 370</a> whereas Haasan described it as an “assault on democracy”.</p>
      <p>For all their love of films, people in Tamil Nadu make a distinction between cinema and governance. Rajinikanth and Haasan would do well to realise that while their star power may pull in the crowds, they will need to spell out their political agenda to convince even their fans to vote for them. It is useful, here, to remember a certain MGR, the popular hero-turned-successful politician, who had put in many years in the DMK as a member, campaigner and fund-raiser before branching out with his own political party.</p>
