      <p>From running a successful rock scaling business to becoming the star of his own TV series, Mike Hall never thought he would get his own reality show at 62 years of age.</p>
      <p>“I still wake up some mornings and go ‘What happened?'” Hall says less than 24 hours before the premiere of Rust Valley Restorers' second season is set to launch.</p>
      <p>This season will be filled with everything from tears, laughter, heart-wrenching stories and even a fall out between Hall and his right-hand man Avery Shoaf.</p>
      <p>“There will be some amazing stories, we have got like 12 episodes coming out and we do some pretty cool stuff,” Hall says.</p>

      <p>Rust Valley Restorers made its small-screen debut in <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/rasta-blasta-blasting-onto-television-with-rust-valley-restorers-set-in-shuswap/it57893">December 2018 on the History Channel</a>. It stars Hall — also known as the Rasta Blasta — along with his son Connor Hall, and Shoaf. The show focuses on the three mechanics trying to restore broken down cars.</p>
      <p>Hall became a well-known name in the area when he tried to sell his five-acre parcel of land in Tappen along with the 300 cars Hall had collected over 40 years. Although he didn’t sell his cars, he did end up with the reality TV show restoring vehicles.</p>
      <p>This season, viewers can expect to hear emotional stories from the people the mechanics meet while restoring vehicles.</p>
      <p>“It’s not always about the build. I kind of get emotionally tied up in some of the builds and it’s not good for business but it makes for great TV,” Hall says, adding there are several times he breaks down during the season.</p>
      <p>“Those guys love it when I break down, I think they try to do it to me on purpose,” he says.</p>

      <p>The mechanics are still filming for the second season and say each vehicle takes around 600 hours each to restore.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing easy about fixing up something that has been parked in a guy’s field for 20 to 30 years and bringing it back to life,” Hall says.</p>
      <p>The mechanics say finding parts and dealing with rust are some of the biggest problems they run into this season, especially with Canadian vehicles.</p>
      <p>Viewers can also expect to see some shots from all over the Thompson and the Okanagan including Savona, Barriere, down to Osoyoos, Oliver, Penticton and Kelowna.</p>
      <p>The second season will premiere tomorrow, Nov. 21, on the History Channel at 10 p.m.</p>
      <p>The first season is available to stream on Netflix.</p>
