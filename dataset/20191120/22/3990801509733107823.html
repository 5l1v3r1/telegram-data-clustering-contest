      <h1>Leak: The OnePlus 8 Pro could pack dual selfie cameras</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:27:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author">Napier Lopez</a></address>
      <p>A leak is making the rounds today claiming to include internal product diagrams for the OnePlus 8 Pro. The most interesting tidbit is on the front: if the leak is to be believed OnePlus is abandoning the pop-up camera in favor of a whole-punch camera as seen on the Galaxy S10 and Note 10.</p>
      <p>The leak, published by <a href="https://true-tech.net/oneplus/exclusive-oneplus-8-pro-product-diagram-leaks-showing-four-camera-sensors/">True-Tech</a>, was supposedly provided by a OnePlus employee. It corroborates an <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-our-first-look-oneplus-8-pro">October leak</a> that showed a similar rear camera setup and hole-punch camera, but only showed one camera on the front. It now appears the standard OnePlus 8 might only have the one camera, but the Pro model will get two.</p>

      <p>On the rear, we can see a similar triple-camera layout to the current OnePlus devices, including wide, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses. New is a time-of-flight sensor, which would presumably help with depth-sensing in photography as well as augmented reality tasks. The report also points to a two-tone flash, which seems a little unnecessary given how good low light photography has gotten across flagship phones.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what the second sensor on the front does. It could be an ultrawide camera for group selfies, or it could be a depth sensor to enhance selfie portraits or face login. My hope is former; the group selfie camera was one of my favorite features of the Pixel 3, and I was sad to see it go in the Pixel 4.</p>
      <p>In any case, moving to a hole-punch camera should presumably assuage any concerns over the pop-up mechanism failing. Of course, take this all with a grain of salt; even if the leak is true, it’s still early days and the phone’s design is very much subject to change.</p>
