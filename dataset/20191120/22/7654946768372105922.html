      <h1>Is Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello’s PDA plain gross?</h1>

      <p>Shawn Mendes may make millions swoon, but the 21-year-old crooner and his on-again, off-again girlfriend, Camila Cabello, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/12/camila-cabello-and-shawn-mendes-caught-in-courtside-makeout-session/">also made millions sick</a> when they took their love life a little too public last week — making out courtside at the Los Angeles Clippers game. It was the public display of affection seen ’round the world, and it inspired a collective “Get a room.”</p>
      <p>But not everyone frowns on PDA. Some believe it may be the secret ingredient for a lasting relationship.</p>
      <p>“We always touch,” says 84-year-old Sylvia Haskel, a great-grandmother of five from Somerset, NJ, who’s been married for 60 years. “It’s a natural thing and honest. I would sit on his lap years ago. Now I’m afraid to — you have to watch out for arthritis.” Adds her 87-yer-old husband, Harold, “We’re still affectionate. And we do the things we always did.”</p>
      <p>Clarissa Silva, a Manhattan-based behavioral scientist and relationship coach, agrees that PDA is common among many couples. In fact, she says, hand-holding and kisses goodbye can easily become “a subconscious routine” for some.</p>
      <p>“For many, PDA is about strengthening their bond and acting in the moment of what they feel,” Silva tells The Post, echoing the Haskels.</p>
      <p>Yet for some people, she cautions, such displays are less subconscious than they are a kind of dare — they feel excited at the prospect of getting caught while broadcasting their affection.</p>
      <p>Matthew Kirschner says he isn’t concerned about people’s reactions when he wants to show his longtime girlfriend some love. Nor does the 33-year-old Upper East Side partner at Talent Resources believe all the feedback is bad. “We’ll be stopped at a red light [in a car] and kiss each other, and someone from another car will yell through the window, ‘That’s adorable.’ ”</p>
      <p>Tiffany says she wishes her ex-boyfriend felt that way. The 34-year-old, who asked not to give her last name, says her ex thought any open display of affection was “inappropriate.” Not that she expected they’d take it that far.</p>
      <p>“I love to be touched, nothing gross,” she tells The Post. “I don’t want to make others uncomfortable and certainly believe that many activities can and should remain behind closed doors, but there’s nothing wrong with hand-holding [or putting your] arms around one another.”</p>
      <p>Brian Howie, host of the long-running national tour and podcast, “The Great Love Debate,” takes it even farther. “There’s nothing more romantic — kiss like no one is watching. When I see two people showing PDA, I think they will never break up. When I see two people afraid to show it, I wonder when they will.”</p>
      <p>Jennifer Zucher disagrees. The Manhattan-based co-founder of dating service Project Soulmate is cynical about what she sees as an attention-getting device.</p>
      <p>“It could be for the show, for publicity,” she says of celebrities who canoodle in public. As for the rest of us, she says, getting hot and heavy can make the people around you uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>And it’s no barometer of a solid relationship, either, she says.</p>
      <p>“If anything,” she says, “couples who are closer probably aren’t slobbering all over each other in the middle of the street.”</p>
