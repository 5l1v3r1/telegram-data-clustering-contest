We're really good with only PG. You put them two together, it's gotta be good. We'll see it tonight. But I'm really excited."</p>

      <p>Leonard has played in nine of the Clippers' first 14 games, averaging 26.8 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 2.1 steals per game. George, who missed the start of the 2019-20 campaign following offseason surgeries on both shoulders and made his debut Thursday against the Pelicans, has been terrific with Leonard out. The 29-year-old has posted 29.3 points, 6.7 rebounds and 3.7 assistswhile shooting 56.3 percent from the field and 52.2 percent from 3-point range in his first three games.</p>
      <p>Despite the health issues with their two stars, the Clippers find themselves at 9-5 overall with the <a href="https://stats.nba.com/teams/advanced/?sort=NET_RATING&amp;dir=-1">sixth-best net rating in the NBA</a>. The Leonard-George duo will start with a significant test, though, as the Celtics enter Wednesday'scontest with the best record in the Eastern Conference (11-2).</p>
