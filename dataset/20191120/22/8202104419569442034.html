      <h1>Music Notes: He's got The Looks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:50:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Olson</a></address>
      <p>It's not just a mildly clever pun — Dany Laj and The Looks, Sammy Lee Folkerson, and Matt Patershuk are all playing in Saskatoon this week.</p>
      <h4>Is it Christmas yet?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/1119-news-enchanted-forest">The Enchanted Forest is already open and rolling (shining?);</a> the Festival of Trees is happening at the Western Development Museum, and unless I am somehow mistaken, it’s not even December.</p>
      <p>You know where it’s not Christmas yet? At most of our great concert venues. Dany Laj, Sammy Lee Folkerson, and Matt Patershuk aren’t playing holiday tunes this week, so get out there. Don’t know anything about them? That’s fine — we’ve got you covered.</p>
      <h3>Dany Laj and The Looks</h3>
      <p><b>When:</b> Saturday, Nov. 23</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> Amigos Cantina</p>
      <p><b>What: </b>As far as group names go, this one would make my short list for the coveted Best Band Name Award. As far as the music goes, it’s a ton of fun. The band has an old-school pop-rock sound right out of the late ’90s and early 2000s, with vaguely punk-tinged vocal sounds and driving beats. It’s great, high-energy stuff that wavers back and forth from sounding like classic rock to more modern pop. It’s got a lovely variety to it, and Laj is a charismatic frontman for his rhythm section in The Looks. Take the time to have some fun and check these guys out — they’re dang good.</p>

      <h3>Sammy Lee Folkerson</h3>
      <p><b>When:</b> Friday, Nov. 22</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> Capitol Music Club</p>
      <p><b>What: </b><a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/entertainment/local-arts/rock-n-roll-questionnaire-reignwolf">Boy, does Saskatoon ever crank out top notch bluesy-rock singer/songwriters.</a> Sammy Lee Folkerson — who plays with Bombargo and other group projects — is putting on an EP release party on Friday night. Folkerson’s sound is richly jazzy and blues-laden, but he’s also got plenty of experience as more of a rocker. From Bombargo to Contrafract and his own solo music, Folkerson is certainly not short on experience or performing panache — which means the release party on Nov. 22 should be a heck of a show.</p>
      <h3>Matt Patershuk</h3>
      <p><b>When:</b> Tuesday, Nov. 26</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> The Bassment</p>
      <p><b>What: </b>Can I just take a second to talk about Matt Patershuk’s voice? It’s incredible. He’s got almost a custom-made, quintessential country-sounding voice. His charming country-folk ballads feel like genuine ballads — big, simple, real stories that Patershuk tells with musical aplomb. Some of his older tunes have a bit more of a rock touch to them, but his newest album (released this year) is dripping with country spirit. It’s just a fun brand of music, and Patershuk puts his own stamp on it with his amazing storytelling. Did I mention he’s got a great voice? His low notes aren’t spectacular for how low they are, but a gentle rasp adds a delightful layer across his vocal range.</p>
