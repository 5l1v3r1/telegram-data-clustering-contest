      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481180/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-2-star-loved-the-easter-egg-in-it-chapter-two">The horror genre</a> has been in a serious renaissance for the past few years, and is showing no signs of slowing down. Plenty of unique horror flicks have arrived in theaters, resulting in critical and box office success. Chief among them is Andy Muschietti's pair of <i>IT</i> movies, which both <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481053/how-it-chapter-twos-box-office-draw-compares-to-the-first-movie-so-far">made a ton of money</a> during their theatrical run. Given the success of both the first movie and <i>IT Chapter Two</i>, fans have been wondering if Pennywise might return in a spinoff. And writer Gary Dauberman thinks there's definitely more story to tell.</p>
      <p>Gary Dauberman wrote the screenplay for both <i>IT</i> and <i>IT Chapter Two</i>, so he's gotten to know the character of Pennywise very well over the past few years. Whenever movies make money, there seems to be the <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485264/wait-the-joker-todd-phillips-sequel-news-may-not-be-a-thing-after-all">possibility of more sequels</a>-- especially <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480597/all-the-horror-movies-you-can-see-in-theaters-after-it-chapter-two-this-fall">within the horror genre</a>. Dauberman recently spoke this possibility regarding the <i>IT</i> franchise, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>I do think it's possible. Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me but there's only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie. It's just a question of whether or not people want to see it but I do think It was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that's a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell and I think you could do that for sure.</blockquote>
      <p>Well, that's certainly intriguing. It looks like the writer of the <i>IT</i> franchise thinks there are plenty of stories to mine from, considering Pennywise's long history eating children. But it's just a matter of the studio and audience getting behind another movie hitting theaters.</p>
      <p>Gary Dauberman's comments to <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/it-chapter-two-writer-gary-dauberman-talks-spinoff-possibilities-and-that-rumored-supercut-exclusive-a171703">Comic Book Movie</a> are sure to excite the hardcore horror fans out there who can't get enough of Bill Skarsgård's dancing clown. The 29 year-old actor <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2479488/what-the-it-miniseries-did-better-than-it-chapter-two">had big shoes to fill</a> when he took the role first made famous by Tim Curry. But Skarsgård brought a new type of terror to Pennywise, with countless jump scared and disturbing sequences as he stalked the Losers' Club.</p>

        <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480183/it-chapter-twos-bill-skarsgard-says-hes-filled-his-infant-daughters-room-with-pennywise-dolls">Related: IT Chapter Two's Bill Skarsgard Says He's Filled His Infant Daughter's Room With Pennywise Dolls</a>

      <p>While <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480205/it-chapter-two-director-reveals-one-deleted-scene-what-he-wants-to-include-in-supercut">Andy Muschietti's <i>IT</i> movies</a> focused on the Losers' Club in their childhood and adults, Pennywise had been hunting down children in Derry for hundreds of years. As such, there are countless stories that could be adapted for the big screen, showing how the demonic clown manipulated and terrified the townspeople in days pas. Because while Bill, Bev, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480686/wait-did-it-chapter-two-have-an-alternate-ending-for-richie">and their friends</a> might have finally slayed the monster in <i>IT Chapter Two</i>, he had a long tenure eating children.</p>
      <p>The writer of the <i>IT</i> franchise may have ideas for future movies, it's unclear if Warner Bros, Andy Muschietti, and/or Bill Skarsgård are interested. Only time will tell, but horror fans would likely be delighted.</p>
      <p><i>IT Chapter Two</i> will be available on DVD and Blu-ray on December 10.
