      <p>Back in early 2018, the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> were finally looking like contenders following a slow start to the season, and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/andre-roberson">Andre Roberson</a> was being backed as a certainty for the NBA All-Defensive First Team. Nevertheless, Roberson ruptured his left patellar tendon during a trip to the Detroit Pistons on January 27 and was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>While a serious injury, Roberson was expected to recover in time for the 2018-19 season, however, the Colorado product suffered a series of setbacks throughout the year and ended up missing the entire season.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, Roberson seemed to be finally closing in on his much-anticipated return as head coach Billy Donovan revealed that the 27-year-old <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5642842/roberson-has-kept-confidence-in-long-awaited-return-to-court">had returned to practice</a> with no restrictions. However, Roberson was absent from the Thunder's season opener and has since been ruled out from selection on a nightly basis.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma City haven't been especially forthcoming on Roberson's status, although <a href="https://twitter.com/joe_mussatto/status/1195495376163397632">Donovan recently provided this concerning update</a> on his status:</p>
      <blockquote>I don't have a timetable to be able to say when that would be (Roberson's return). We're hopeful... How far away from playing is he? It's just too hard for me to say.</blockquote>
      <p>The fact that the organization still doesn't know when Roberson will return after two years out is incredibly worrying, while it is fair to guess that the guard has suffered a further setback as he had stepped up his return to fitness during the weeks leading up to the season.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, everyone in Oklahoma City is routing for Roberson to make a return, although with his status still a mystery and his contract expiring in the summer, he may never suit up for the Thunder again.</p>
