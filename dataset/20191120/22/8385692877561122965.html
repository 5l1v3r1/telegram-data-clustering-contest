      <p>Amazon has the iRobot Roomba 675 <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> for just $230. That is lower than its advertised Black Friday price. Which means that you can order it now and have it around to clean up your home in time for all of the family to come over for Thanksgiving!</p>
      <p>The iRobot Roomba 675 has many of the popular Roomba features, including the three-stage cleaning system. This system is able to get up all of the dirt and dust from around your home with ease. It has two front brushes that will lift the dirt, making it easier for the center rolling brush to pick it up. And it also has a good amount of suction available.</p>
      <p>Roomba 675 is going to be really good at getting up pet hair as well, thanks to the pretty strong suction that it has included.</p>

      <p><a href="http://bit.ly/2K0mXRr">iRobot Roomba 675</a> is able to clean carpet, hardwood and laminate floors. It does a better job on hardwood and laminate since there's no carpet there, obviously. But it does a good job on any floor.</p>
      <p>The Roomba 675 does navigate around your home, after it has mapped it out. These maps are not sold off to other companies, unlike popular belief. These maps are simply used to navigate your home and get every inch of your home cleaned. So that you won't need to worry about it missing any spots. That's definitely a good thing these days.</p>
      <p>Finally, the iRobot Roomba 675 works with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. So you are able to ask Google to ask Roomba to start cleaning. This can really come in handy. The app can also be used to see where it has cleaned and set up schedules as well. So it can clean every single day.</p>
