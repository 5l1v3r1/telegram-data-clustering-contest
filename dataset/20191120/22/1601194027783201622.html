      <p>Michael Cuisance's lack of game time at Bayern Munich shows he should never have left Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>That is the view of Gladbach sporting director Max Eberl, who reluctantly sanctioned the French midfielder's €10million switch in August this year.</p>
      <p>Cuisance has made a pair of Bundesliga substitute appearances for Bayern, remaining unused on the bench on 11 other occasions in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Minor adductor and groin setbacks have also hindered the 20-year-old, whose former club sit four points ahead of Bayern at the top of the table after 11 matches.</p>
      <p>"We told him for three months that he would have been better staying here because he had found in Gladbach a club where he could develop," Eberl told Sport1.</p>
      <p>"He had a great development last season. He did not want to settle for that and had other goals in mind for himself, which he has now pursued."</p>
      <p>Cuisance will hope the installation of interim head coach Hansi Flick brings about a change of fortunes.</p>
      <p>Marco Rose's in-form Gladbach travel to the Allianz Arena to take on Bayern on December 7.</p>
