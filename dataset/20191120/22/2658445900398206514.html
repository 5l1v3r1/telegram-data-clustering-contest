The reason is the Federal Government is planning to implement what its describes as major tarrif adjustment next year.  This, no doubt, will worsen the plight of the average consumers of electricity, who are daily experiencing power outages and its attendant effects on the economy, writes AKINOLA AJIBADE</u>

      <p>The Federal Government is to carry out a review of electricity tarrifs next month, which will be implemented  in January. This to promote efficiency in the sector currently battling problems such as illiquidity and poor service delivery due to lack of many deficient consumables required to deliver power to consumers.</p>
      <p>Electricity tarriffs that are integral to the growth of the sector vary from one firm to another, depending on how customers are classified.</p>
      <p>Before now, the government, through the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), this year approved five minor electricity tarriff reviews, that were pending since June 2016, a development which has caused a spike in the cost of electricity.</p>
      <p>In its latest reports, NERC said the reviews approved were for the periods before 2018, adding that it was yet to approve a review of the tarriff for the first half of 2019. It said the tarriffs covered more than eight million customers in the books of the 11 power distribution companies (DisCos) in the country.</p>
      <p>The issue has generated public outcry, as members of the organised labour have criticised the measure, describing the development as unfortunate. It argued that  industry was struggling to provide enough power to meet the growing needs of Nigerians.</p>
      <p>While this lasted, the commission is working on how to review major tarriffs by  next month, which would be implemented in January.</p>
      <p>Investigation revealed that the implementation of major tarriffs would, like others before it, follow a progressive pattern, which means that NERC would increase the tarriffs in relation to the quantum of energy allocated by each distribution company and consumed by the end users.</p>
      <p>Findings further showed that the sector, on the average, has recorded an increase in tarriffs in the past five years.  It is on record that electricity consumers paid between N10 per kilowatt hour and N24.20 kobo per kilowatt hour within a period of five years – 2015 to 2019, without substantial improvement in electricity supply.</p>
      <p>Based on this, the industry will likely  witness increase in tarriffs in future, as NERC, in line with the constitution, is obliged to review tarriffs every six months, as stated in the Act, which established the Multi-Year-Tarrif Order (MYTO).</p>
      <p>MYTO was designed by the Federal Government to provide correct pricing, taking into consideration the key principles of cost reflectiveness and affordability, among others.</p>
      <p>Stakeholders said any attempts by NERC to increase tarriffs next year without ensuring a corresponding improvement in the supply of electricity,  would be an error of judgement..</p>
      <p>The stakeholders, who are drawn from the distribution arm of the power, manufacturing and allied sectors of the economy, berated the government for increasing tarriffs, in the face of irregular supply of electricity and low productivity.</p>

          <u>DisCos</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 11 power distribution companies (DisCos) are in tandem with the Federal Government to implement major tarriffs in the sector. The firms, in the second quarter of 2019, was to hold a meeting with NERC on the issue. Though the meeting was postponed, the firms resolved that consumers must pay tarriffs as and when due.</p>
      <p>The Director, Research and Advocacy, Association of Nigerian Energy Distributors (ANED),  Sunday Oduntan, said the firms recorded a shortfall in tarriffs of N384 billion ilast year, saying the government should address the shortfall to enable DisCos perform their obligations.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>He said the sector had a tarriff gap of N1.3 trillion, arguing that the development had made it difficult for the power companies to perform the aggrements with the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>He said:” The tarrif gap is between what government has specified as the cost of electricity that we ( DisCos) distribute or retail and the cost of the product. It is the gap that has solely contributed to the excess of N1.3 trillion, which DisCos are carrying on their books.”</p>
      <p>Oduntan said the firms were not advocating for increase in tarrifs, but calling on the government to bridge the gap recorded by operators. He said when this happens, the firms would improve their services, maintain and build new networks, buy new equipment, solve metering problems and put in place other measures that would help in improving operational efficiency.</p>

          <u>Manufacturers’ opinons</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Consumers – industrial and domestic – are at the receiving end of problems in the sector. Industrial consumers are firms which provide services and produce goods.</p>
      <p>The President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria(MAN), Mansur Ahmed, said manufacturers were burdened by poor regulation of the power sector and tarriff regime, saying the sector was unable to provide regular electricity despite it being privatised  six years ago.</p>
      <p>Ahmed said:” We ( manufacturers) are frustrated by issues such as poor regulation and tarrif regime. We all know that power is not available in Nigeria,” wondering  why  government is asking consumers to pay tarriffs on energy that is not adequately provided for them.</p>
      <p>He added:  “Both the minor and major tarriff reviews that have been conducted in the time past, do not reflect in the quality of electricity, that is being supplied to Nigerians.They are short of expectations.</p>
      <p>He said the priority of the government should be on how to administer the tarriffs well and not increasing them without corresponding services to the people.</p>
      <p>“If power is available 24 fours in Nigeria, people would not be forced to pay for the energy which they are consuming. It is wrong to continue to impose tarriffs on people amid poor electricity supply in the country.” he added.</p>
      <p>He said tarriffs should reflect the cost of energy consumed by users, stating that consumers would be encouraged to pay when they have cost-reflective tarriffs.</p>
      <p>The economy, Ahmed said, is constrained by problems in the energy sector, stressing that the country may witnesss another round of recession, if it failed to significantly improve its power generation, distribution and transmission process.</p>

          <u>Labour kicks</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Organised Labour Unions, including Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and allied movements are protesting the plans to implement new tarriffs, saying such moves  demonstrated  that the government was not sensitive to the plight of masses.</p>
      <p>NLC President Mr. Ayuba Wabba, urged Nigerians to resist attempts by the government to hike  tarriffs, alleging that the Ministry of Power had conspired with electricity companies to create new tarriffs.</p>
      <p>Also, TUC President Mr. Bala Kaigama also alleged that NERC and electricity firms were trying to undercut Nigerians, by ensuring that they paid tarriffs not proportinate to the services they are giving to the people.</p>
