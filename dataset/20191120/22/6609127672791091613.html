      <p>Mr Salmond was charged with a total of 14 offences on January 24 this year.</p>
      <p>He strongly denies all allegations against him.</p>
      <p>Mr Salmond was Scotland’s First Minister between 2007 and 2014.</p>
      <p>Police began an investigation following a Scottish Government inquiry into complaints of sexual harassment against him.</p>
      <p>Mr Salmond launched a judicial review against the government’s handling of the probe, saying he had been treated unfairly.</p>
      <p>The government later conceded its procedures had been flawed and paid out over £500,000 for the ex-top Nat’s legal fees.</p>
