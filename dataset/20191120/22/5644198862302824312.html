      <p>Hotel employees helped to direct traffic through the hotel’s driveway to ease congestion, Mr Kheng said.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported and normal traffic along Scotts Road resumed at 3.55pm, he added.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness told CNA that he noticed the fallen tree at about 3.30pm. Jin Yuan, 29, said that a white car was trapped underneath the tree.</p>

      <p>The Land Transport Authority said on its Twitter page that the stretch of Scotts Road (towards Claymore Hill) after Stevens Road was closed due to an “obstacle”.</p>
