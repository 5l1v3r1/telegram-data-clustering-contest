      <p><b>Mini</b> has revealed the <b>JCW GP</b> will be priced from <b>$63,900</b> before on-road costs when it arrives in <b>Australia.</b></p>
      <p>That's $12,500 more than a conventional two-door Mini JCW, and and a whopping $22,200 more than a Cooper S.</p>
      <p>It's also more expensive than conventional hot hatches like the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/honda-civic-type-r/">Honda Civic Type R</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/volkswagen-golf-r/">Volkswagen Golf R</a>, although it manages to undercut the pared-back <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/801442/renault-megane-rs-trophy-r-price-announced-record-edition/">Renault Megane RS Trophy-R</a> by $11,090.</p>

      <p>Mini says a "small number" of the 3000 units being built are coming to Australia, and pre-orders mean most of our allocation is already spoken for.</p>
      <p>Like its predecessors, the new JCW GP significantly more focused than the regular Mini line-up – the rear seats are gone, the body has been stiffened up, and there are bespoke mounts for the engine, transmission and suspension.</p>
      <p>Power comes from a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbocharged engine outputting 225kW and 450Nm.</p>

      <p>If those figures sound familiar, it's because the engine has been borrowed from the BMW X2 M35i – albeit with unique cooling systems designed to handle the sort of hard track work Mini expects GP owners to undertake.</p>
      <p>In a significant departure from its predecessors, the new JCW GP will not be offered with a manual transmission. Instead, it's only available with an eight-speed automatic with paddles behind the steering wheel.</p>
      <p>To keep all that power in check, there's a mechanical locking differential on the front axle. Mini says the car will hit 100km/h in just 5.2 seconds from standstill, and will do 265km/h flat out. That's without an electric limiter, for what it's worth.</p>

      <p>Mini has also upped the visual drama with a wide bodykit made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). Rather than using a boring build plate to signify which of the 3000 cars you've bought, Mini will actually emblazon the build number on the GP's front wheel arch extensions.</p>
      <p>Inside, there's less sound insulation than you get in a standard Mini JCW, while the instruments, steering wheel, seats, and gear selector trim are all unique. Mini has also fitted a 5.0-inch digital instrument binnacle adapted from that in the electric Cooper.</p>
