      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been given a lift with Luke Shaw, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/07/axel-tuanzebe-manchester-uniteds-young-defender-starts-against/">Axel Tuanzebe</a> and Nemanja Matic all returning to full training after injury but the Manchester United manager is set to be without Scott McTominay for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/sheffield-united-vs-manchester-united-premier-league-time-kick/">Sunday’s trip to Sheffield United</a>.</p>
      <p>Shaw has been sidelined for almost three months after a setback in his recovery from a hamstring ­injury suffered in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/24/manchester-united-vs-crystal-palace-premier-league-live-score/">the 2-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace in August</a>.</p>
      <p>Teenager Brandon Williams and veteran Ashley Young, who is available again after suspension, have filled in at left-back in Shaw’s prolonged absence.</p>
      <p>Tuanzebe, who also played there in the 1-1 draw against Arsenal, has been out since injuring his hip during the warm-up against Liverpool last month but the centre-half is available again.</p>
      <p>Matic’s last appearance was in the goalless Europa League draw away to AZ Alkmaar on Oct 3 and his return is well-timed with Solskjaer likely to be without fellow midfielder McTominay for the game at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>McTominay was forced to withdraw from international duty with Scotland after sustaining an ankle injury during the 3-1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. He did not train on Wednesday and there are serious doubts over his involvement on Sunday. Three other rehabilitating players, Eric Bailly, Timothy Fosu-Mensah (both knee) and Diogo Dalot, were given a separate workout at United’s Aon Training Complex on Wednesdaybut are not yet ready to rejoin the squad.</p>
      <p>Solkjaer’s side are just one point behind Sheffield United in the Premier League table but have won only one of their last 10 away games in the competition and they have conceded at least once in each of their last 11 matches on the road.</p>
