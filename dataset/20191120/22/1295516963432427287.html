      <h1>Henry Cavill Owes His Batman v Superman Physique to Ben Affleck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:11:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Hickson</a></address>
      <p>In addition to being the second entry in the DC Extended Universe, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/batman-v-superman/">Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</a> was also the first live-action movie to feature the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel appearing together. Of course, for a role like Superman, actor Henry Cavill—who portrayed the character in the film, as well as <i>Man of Steel</i> and <i>Justice League</i>—had to get into shape for it. However, according to Cavill's costar Ben Affleck, the actor may owe his heroic build to him.</p>
      <p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">Men's Health</a>, Affleck discussed working out with Cavill for the film, while also throwing in some humor. “I wouldn’t say we ‘worked out’ so much as I acted as Henry’s trainer,” Affleck said. “I really had to help him increase muscle mass—before my coaching, he looked like Gumby. In all honesty, we did work out together. And I <i>hated</i> it.”</p>

      <p>Released on March 25, 2016, <i>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</i> starred Affleck and Cavill in the respective titular roles, which they would reprise for <i>Justice League</i> the following year. The film managed to rake in $873.6 million at the box office, though it was still deemed a failure due to not reaching an anticipated $1 billion total.</p>
      <p>However, after <i>Justice League</i>'s box office failure, Affleck will no longer portray the Caped Crusader, as <a href="https://screenrant.com/batman-movie-2021-robert-pattinson-training/amp/">Robert Pattinson</a> will take up the mantle in director Matt Reeves' <i>The Batman</i>. Cavill, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/henry-cavill-not-ready-stop-playing-superman/">recently stated he has "not given up the role" of Superman</a>.</p>
