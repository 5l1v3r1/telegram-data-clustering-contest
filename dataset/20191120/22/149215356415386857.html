      <p>As Bolivia's political situation intensifies, the country's interim government Wednesday <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bolivia-releases-audio-it-says-proves-morales-has-incited-food-blockades-11574282911?mod=hp_lista_pos1">produced</a> audio it says consists of former exiled President Evo Morales ordering a blockade to prevent food from entering Bolivian cities. But Morales' supporters have dismissed the recording as fraudulent.</p>
      <p>"Brother, don't led food into the cities, we are going to do a blockade, a true siege," someone whom the government says is Morales <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bolivia-releases-audio-it-says-proves-morales-has-incited-food-blockades-11574282911?mod=hp_lista_pos1">is heard</a> saying in what is allegedly a phone call he made from exile in Mexico. "From now it is going to be fight, fight, fight."</p>
      <p>The audio was released by Interior Minister Arturo Murillo one day after the military clashed violently with Morales' supporters who were reportedly blocking fuel from reaching the capital, La Paz, which along with several other cities throughout the country has been facing a food and fuel shortage since the standoff between the protesters and interim government began, per <i><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bolivia-releases-audio-it-says-proves-morales-has-incited-food-blockades-11574282911?mod=hp_lista_pos1">The Wall Street Journal</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Morales' backers, who have accused the military of orchestrating a right wing coup to remove the socialist Morales from power, argue that the government released the video in an attempt to distract the country as it conducts a crackdown on protesters who are demanding Morales' return.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, morales activists have reportedly shared videos showing soldiers firing live rounds at protesters. Morales called upon the interim government Wednesday to "stop this massacre of indigenous brothers who ask for peace, democracy, and respect of life in the streets."
