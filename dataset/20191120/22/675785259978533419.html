      <h2>EXCLUSIVE Under-fire Everton boss Marco Silva has been given the backing of club legend Andy Gray, who draws parallels with the situation of Howard Kendall in the 1980s</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p>For Marco Silva in November 2019, read Howard Kendall in November 1983.</p>
      <p>Andy Gray can see parallels between Silva’s plight at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and the situation facing Kendall when he arrived at Goodison Park back in that winter of discontent.</p>
      <p>Kendall was facing fan boycotts and calls for his head because the Blues were going nowhere.</p>
      <p>The then chairman, Philip Carter, stuck by Kendall and Gray, coupled with Kevin Brock’s infamous backpass in the League Cup, helped spark Everton’s remarkable revival.</p>
      <p>The rest, as Evertonians joyfully know, is history as Kendall embarked on the club’s most-successful era, winning two league titles, the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners’ Cup.</p>
      <p>Gray says Everton must also stand by Silva, claiming they must break the cycle of hiring and firing managers.</p>

      <p>“When I arrived at Everton, Howard was under huge pressure,” said the former Blues striker. “There were petitions saying ‘Kendall must go’. Philip Carter, in fairness to him, stuck by him.</p>
      <p>“It was staggering that we could turn from what we were to what we became in such a short period, it was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“I hope Silva can also turn it round. I don’t want Everton to become a club that sacks managers every 18 months. At some time, someone has to be given time.</p>
      <p>“Since Martinez left, who got almost three years, there has been a collection of managers who have come and gone, like Koeman and Sam Allardyce, so somebody has to be given a chance.</p>
      <p>“If they feel Silva is the man, then they’ve got to stick with him.”</p>
      <p>Gray, who won the FA Cup, League title and Cup Winners’ Cup in his 20 months at Goodison, was part of their feared frontline with Graeme Sharp and Adrian Heath.</p>

      <p>What Evertonians would give to have one of them now and Gray was reunited with Sharp and his old team-mates for the launch of the film ‘Everton - Howard’s Way’, which chronicles that golden era.</p>
      <p>Sitting underneath a picture of himself holding the Cup Winners’ Cup in the ‘85 lounge at Goodison, Gray lamented Everton’s need of a proper No 9.</p>
      <p>“They’re lacking a genuine goalscorer,” said the Scot. “That’s a big problem for Everton.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know if Moise Kean is going to be good enough yet. He’s still young, they’ve taken a gamble on him and he’s going to need time.</p>
      <p>“Dominic Calvert-Lewin does a lot of good things, maybe works too hard - if that sounds stupid - outside the box trying to make up for his deficiencies inside the box. If he’s going to be top bracket, he needs to up his goal ratio dramatically.</p>

      <p>“Cenk Tosun, his goalscoring record was good. But that was Turkey and this is a different league altogether.”</p>
      <p>Gray, 63, claims Everton must follow up their win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> , which was only their second in eight league games, by beating Norwich on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It has to change some time, there has to be a turning point this season for Everton or else they’re going to struggle,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I just hope we can put back-to-back wins together now. We had a good win before the international break against Southampton.</p>
      <p>“If we could beat Norwich, that would be a good six points. It would move us up the league and then things might begin to look a bit better.”</p>
