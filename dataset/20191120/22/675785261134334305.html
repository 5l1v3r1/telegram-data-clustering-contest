      <h1>Martin Keown urges Arsenal to bring in axed Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino was sensationally sacked as Tottenham manager on Tuesday night and replaced by Jose Mourinho</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:24:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:24</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Martin Keown has made the bold claim that Arsenal should make a shock move for recently-sacked former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, 47, was dismissed less than six months after he took Spurs to the Champions League final, with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Mourinho announced as his replacement on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The Argentine boss leaves Tottenham 14th in the table and with just three wins from their opening 12 games of the Premier League campaign.</p>
      <p>Over in the red half of north London, Unai Emery is also under pressure after a miserable run of form - and Gunners icon Keown reckons Emirates chiefs should turn to their former rival.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7707847/Martin-Keown-calls-Arsenal-Mauricio-Pochettino.html">The Daily Mail</a> : "There’s no need to panic at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , we are getting close to panic by the way, because we’re not having the best of seasons, but the powers that be at the top of the club should be seriously considering Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"I have a lot of admiration for what he did at Tottenham, the way he nurtured those young players and he didn’t spend a great deal of money.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think Tottenham spent enough."</p>
      <p>During Pochettino's five and a half years at Spurs, he delivered four successive top-four finishes in the Premier League, which included two title challenges, a memorable run to the European Cup final last season and developed the likes of Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen into top-class players.</p>
      <p>He also had to contend with playing at Wembley for 18 months while Tottenham's new stadium was built and went through two transfer windows without signing anyone.</p>

      <p>But chairman Daniel Levy grew impatient with a decline in form this calendar year as Spurs took only 23 points from their last 24 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Keown, however, believes Spurs have made a mistake by sacking the fans' favourite.</p>
      <p>He added: "I would have stayed with Pochettino. I think he deserved that. I think it’s a hugely significant sacking. You’re going to have managers now looking over their shoulders.</p>
      <p>"I know the poor record he has recently, I know it all but I still would have given him another chance. I don’t like the way Tottenham have done it.</p>
      <p>"There will be a lot of chairmen looking at him now. Manchester United wanted him this time last year. I think Arsenal would have to be interested if they want to take a step forward."</p>
