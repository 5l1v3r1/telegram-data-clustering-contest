      <h2>Bid to stop neo-Nazis making pilgrimages to site</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:46:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:46</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Robinson and Stephanie Halasz, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - The house in which Adolf Hitler was born is set to be turned into a police station in a bid to stop it becoming a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis, the Austrian government says.</p>
      <p>The building, located in the north-western Austrian town of Braunau am Inn, was forcibly acquired by the Austrian government in 2017.</p>
      <p>The property's future has been the source of debate in Austria. In 2016, there were plans for it to be demolished.</p>
      <p>The Interior Ministry noted that they received "special legal authorization" to expropriate the property, and paid compensation amounting to â‚¬812,000 ($898,389) to its former owner.</p>
      <p>"The handling of Adolf Hitler's birthplace in Braunau am Inn has been a challenge for the Second Republic for more than 70 years, especially in connection with the history of the Third Reich in Austria," the Interior Ministry said in a statement sent to CNN.</p>
      <p>It added that the legislator ordered the Austrian government to ensure that post-expropriation, the use of the property should prevent any further "national socialist activity."</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Peschorn, Austria's Interior Minister, praised the acquisition of the property and said it would halt it becoming a neo-Nazi symbol.</p>
      <p>"The future use of the house by the police will be an unmistakable signal that this building will never serve to commemorate National Socialism," he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>While the legal case relating to the expropriation of the property has now concluded, local police are not set to move into the building for some time yet.</p>
      <p>The Austrian government is set to hold an EU-wide architectural competition to redesign the building, the Interior Ministry said.</p>
      <p>A winner of the competition is expected to be announced in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>"The competition proposals are to be evaluated by an independent jury of experts, which will include not only architects, but also a representative of the city of Braunau, the BIG (Bundesimmobilien GmbH), the Federal Government and the National Fund," the Interior Ministry said.</p>
      <p>Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, close to the German border, in 1889, and lived in one of the property's flats for the first few weeks of his life.</p>
