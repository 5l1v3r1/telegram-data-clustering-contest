      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 21 — An auction of Nazi memorabilia, including Adolf Hitler’s top hat, raked in hundreds of thousands of euros in Munich yesterday in the teeth of German and international protest.</p>
      <p>The hammer fell on the Nazi leader’s top hat at €50,000 (RM230,672), according to the Hermann Historica auction house website, while items of clothing belonging to his partner Eva Braun each sold for thousands.</p>
      <p>One buyer paid €130,000 for a silver-plated copy of Hitler’s antisemitic political manifesto Mein Kampf that once belonged to senior Nazi Hermann Goering, emblazoned with an eagle and the party’s swastika emblem.</p>
      <p>Other lots of clothing and personal belongings from notorious World War II Nazi leaders like Heinrich Himmler and Rudolf Hess also packed the catalogue pages.</p>
      <p>“The Nazis’ crimes are being trivialised here,” the German government’s antisemitism commissioner Felix Klein told the <i>Funke</i> newspaper group.</p>
      <p>“They’re acting as if they’re trading in perfectly normal historical art objects,” but “there is a danger that Nazi relics become cult objects” for the extreme right, he added.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the auction, European Jewish Association chairman Rabbi Menachem Margolin recalled that “it is Germany that leads Europe in the sheer volume of reported antisemitic incidents”.</p>
      <p>“We urge the German authorities to compel auction houses to divulge the names of those who are buying,” who “should then be put on a government ‘watch’ list,” Margolin said.</p>
      <p>Many of the items belonging to top Nazi leaders were seized by US soldiers in the final days of World War II.</p>
      <p>The dresses belonging to Braun, Hitler’s long-term companion who was briefly his wife before their death, were found among 40 trunks seized by the US military in May 1945 in Salzburg in Austria.</p>
      <p>Some of the more unusual lots include a copy of Hitler’s rental contract in Munich and a pair of sunglasses worn by a defendant at the Nazi war crimes trials in Nuremberg to avoid the glare of the floodlights. — AFP</p>
