      <p>The site of the former OK Builders Supply building just north of downtown Kelowna is slated to become a 15,000 square foot grocery store by next summer.</p>
      <p>That’s the target date to open, Don Pham, owner of Kelowna’s Oriental Supermarket and two Yamato restaurants, told iNFOnews.ca today, Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>“We’re sure we’ll have a grocery store there,” Pham said.</p>
      <p>He has preliminary approval from the city to rezone the Ellis Street property south of Bay Avenue from industrial to retail use but needs to do a bit more work before getting final approval.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/ok-builders-supplies-to-close-building-centres-in-okanagan/it58933">OK Builders closed earlier this year.</a>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://orientalsupermarket.ca/">The Oriental Supermarket has been in Kelowna since 1995</a>, specializing in food and other products from all over the world. It will remain at its current location on Highway 97 in Rutland.</p>
      <p>While his plans are still preliminary, he said the new store will be more of a traditional grocery store with produce, meats and other products seen in regular grocery stores.</p>
      <p>It will also have hot food take-a-way and “grab and go stuff,” Pham said.</p>
      <p>He doesn’t have a name picked for the store but did say it will be an independent store and not part of a chain.</p>
