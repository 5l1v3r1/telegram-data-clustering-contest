      <h1>Tom Brady Says He’s Never Really Liked The Cowboys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:54:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The Dallas Cowboys are one of the teams you either love or you hate. It sure sounds like Tom Brady doesn’t love them.</p>
      <p>Brady and the Patriots are set to host the Cowboys in a critical Week 12 matchup this Sunday afternoon. Obviously, Brady will have his killer instinct with him for this game like he does pretty much every other time he takes the field.</p>
      <p>Still, there might be some added incentive to beat Dallas, considering Brady admitted he’s never been a big fan. You see, Tom grew up in California as a die-hard 49ers fan.</p>
      <p>He was in attendance for “The Catch” when the Niners beat the Cowboys in the NFC Championship Game, and Brady told reporters today he’s always had a bit of a distaste for Dallas.</p>

      <p>Because they play in different conferences, the Cowboys and Patriots have met only 12 times ever. Dallas won the first seven matchups, with New England taking the next five.</p>
      <p>Brady is 4-0 against the ‘Boys, winning in 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2015. This might be his last time facing them, unless they meet in a Super Bowl or Brady is still playing in 2023.</p>
      <p>The latest Cowboys-Patriots tilt will kick off at 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday on FOX.</p>
