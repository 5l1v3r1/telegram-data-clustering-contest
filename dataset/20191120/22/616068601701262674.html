      <p>The West Kelowna Warriors are going to be happy to see some friendly fans in the stands.</p>
      <p>The Warriors completed a near month-long road stretch Wednesday, falling 2-1 to the Surrey Eagles.</p>
      <p>They dropped all seven away from Royal LePage Place, extending their losing skid to a team record-tying nine games.</p>
      <p>Goaltender Johnny Derrick gave the Warriors a chance to end the streak. He was spectacular, turning away 42 of 44 shots he faced as the Warriors were outshot 44-25 over the course of the game.</p>
      <p>Surrey held a 36-10 shot advantage after 40 minutes, but managed to hold just the 2-1 lead.</p>
      <p>Wyatt Schlaht put the Eagles on the board first with the only goal of the opening frame, 15 minutes in.</p>
      <p>Max Bulawka got the equalizer six minutes into the second with his eighth and second in as many games.</p>
      <p>But, it was another late goal that proved to be the difference.</p>
      <p>Kenny Riddett broke the tie with 62 seconds left in the second with what proved to be the winner.</p>
      <p>Neither team was able to score in the final period.</p>
      <p>The Warriors had chances to get the equalizer with a pair of power play chances in the third, but were unable to connect.</p>
      <p>The Warriors finally return to play in front of the home fans Friday when they entertain the Wenatchee Wild. Salmon Arm comes in Saturday.</p>
      <p>It'll also mark the first home dates since a group including Boston businessman John Murphy and Kelowna's Rod Hume purchased the hockey club.</p>
