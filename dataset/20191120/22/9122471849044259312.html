      <h1>NFL Makes Decision On Suspension For Browns DL Larry Ogunjobi</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:01:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Last week, the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers faced off in a pivotal AFC North battle with playoff implications on the line.</p>
      <p>What should have been a great rivalry game turned ugly in the final seconds. Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph dumped off a pass to running back Trey Edmunds when he was tackled by Browns defensive end Myles Garrett.</p>
      <p>Rudolph and Garrett then tussled on the ground before Garrett ripped the helmet off of <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">Rudolph and then hit him with it</a>. Three players received suspensions for their actions in the ensuing brawl.</p>
      <p>Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi received a one-game suspension for a late hit on Rudolph after the initial incident.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday afternoon, the NFL announced it upheld Ogunjobi’s suspension. However, the league withdrew a fine against Ogunjobi for the same hit.</p>
      <p>Here’s the statement from the NFL.</p>

      <p>Garrett and Maurkice Pouncey, who received a three-game suspension, won’t hear about their suspensions until later in the week.</p>
      <p>Pouncey is unlikely to play in the rematch between these two teams in Pittsburgh in Week 14. Garrett, meanwhile, is waiting to find out a concrete number of games he will be suspended.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest from the NFL and the suspensions to Garrett and Pouncey.</p>
