        <b>NICOLA Sturgeon mocked Jeremy Corbyn’s IndyRef2 stance today — and insisted he would not block a vote next year if it meant getting the keys to No10.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The First Minister said the Labour leader’s “red line” on rejecting a referendum early in the next parliament was “looking pretty pink” after a car crash Scots visit last week.</p>

      <p>And she claimed there was no way he could resist approving her 2020 timetable in exchange for SNP MPs’ support to prop up a minority government in the event of a hung parly after December 12.</p>
      <p>In an election speech to supporters on her fifth anniversary as First Minister, Ms Sturgeon said: “If you can make any sense out of what he has said, he has kind of accepted the principle of Scotland being in charge of its own future — he’s quibbling now about the timescale.</p>
      <p>“He is not going to turn his back on an opportunity for a UK Labour government just because he’s determined to block the right of Scottish people to choose their own future.</p>
      <p>“It would take a lot of explaining from him if he was to say ‘no, no, I’m going to walk away from this opportunity. Why am I going to do that? Because I want to veto Scotland’s right to self-determination’.</p>
      <p>“This is a man who favours self-determination for virtually every other country on the planet.”</p>

      <p>Ms Sturgeon also confirmed she will not stop her indy push even if Brexit is scrapped — despite previously claiming the 2016 vote was a “material change” in circumstances to spark a second Scots ballot.</p>
      <p>But the Nats supremo said the chaos of the last three and a half years highlighted the need for Scotland to go it alone.</p>
      <p>She told the crowd in Yes-supporting Dundee: “Brexit is the most extreme example of the broken nature of the Westminster system for Scotland, but it is only one example, one illustration.</p>
      <p>“Even if Brexit is stopped and the UK remains, there is no guarantee down the line we’re not back there.</p>

      <p>“People like Nigel Farage are not simply going to go away.</p>
      <p>“There is no guarantee that we don’t have other policies imposed on us by a Tory government we don’t vote for.</p>
      <p>“So Brexit has brought into sharp relief this fundamental question: if we want Scotland to be the country we all believe it can be, then how do we best secure that?</p>
      <p>“I think increasingly people in Scotland are seeing the benefit of being in charge of our own destiny. This election is an opportunity for people in Scotland to send that message to Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, that our future is not up to them. Our future is up to us.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon claimed there would be no border checkpoints in an independent Scotland.</p>
      <p>She also rejected signing up to the euro and downplayed the country’s £12.6billion deficit, insisting it could be easily managed.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn last week claimed he’d block a vote in his “first term” as PM — until at least 2025.</p>
      <p>Aides later tried to backtrack and said that could change with a Nats majority at Holyrood in 2021.</p>

      <p>Tonight a Labour spokesman branded Ms Sturgeon’s position “nonsense” adding: “Jeremy has repeatedly and categorically ruled out a second Scottish referendum next year.”</p>
      <p>Tory rivals also accused the First Minister of “delusion and double standards” over Brexit and indy.</p>
      <p>Paul Masterton, who is fighting to hang on to his East Renfrewshire seat, said: “Nicola Sturgeon spends every waking hour desperately talking up the downsides of the UK’s departure from the EU.</p>
      <p>“Yet, when it comes to Scotland leaving our own Union, she can’t see what the fuss is all about.”</p>
      <p>Interim Scots leader Jackson Carlaw added: “The truth of it is that Brexit has always been a convenient excuse the SNP have used to campaign for a second referendum.”</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon hit back tonight and slammed the Brexit campaign ahead of the EU poll.</p>
      <p>She said: “There was nothing inevitable about the mess that the Brexit process became.</p>
      <p>“Those who advocated Leave in the referendum didn’t put any detail of what it would mean in practice.</p>
      <p>“Contrast that with the independence referendum in 2014 — there was a detailed prospectus.</p>
      <p>“It was and is that way with Brexit because of their dishonesty and their lack of planning.</p>
      <p>“These are mistakes the independence campaign didn’t make in 2014 and won’t make in future.”</p>
