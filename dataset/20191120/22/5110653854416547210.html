      <p>The movecomes following Toronto's performance of late; the club hasjust two regulation wins over their last 16 games and has alsolost five straight. The Leafs are also 3-5-2 over their last 10 games and sit two points out of a playoff spot with a 9-10-4 record. Not only that, their 3.44 goals against per game is the eighth-highest in the league, while their penalty kill (73.1 percent) is the fourth-worst in the NHL.</p>
      <p>In his four seasons with the team prior to this year, Babcock led Toronto to a 173-133-45 record and three playoff berths, but they suffered first-round losses in each trip to the postseason at the hands of the Washington Capitals and Boston Bruins.</p>
