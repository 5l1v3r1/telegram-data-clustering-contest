      <h1>Cowboys’ Robert Quinn Says ‘It’s Embarrassing To America’ Colin Kaepernick Has To Re-Prove Himself</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:15:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>This past Saturday, Colin Kaepernick worked out for NFL scouts and media members, albeit a much smaller sample than expected due to the venue change, but at least some teams were there.</p>
      <p>Many folks, including Dallas Cowboys defensive end Robert Quinn, think it’s embarrassing that Kaepernick has to even go through all this in the first place, seeing as how he never did anything to warrant him being blackballed from the league.</p>
      <blockquote>“He should never even have been in this position for having your voice heard,” Quinn said Friday, via <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2019/11/16/colin-kaepernick-workout-robert-quinn-comments/4206924002/">USA Today</a>. “Took his team to the Super Bowl, Pro Bowl, done all that stuff. For him to go through all he had to go through for making a stance, which the media took and ran with and put him in this situation? <br/><br/>“It’s kind of embarrassing to America that this guy got to go re-prove himself over making a stance on something that still hasn’t been confronted in today’s world.”</blockquote>
      <p>Kaepernick hasn’t played in the league since 2016, which is when he began kneeling during the National Anthem to take a stance against police brutality and social injustices in the United States. He received a wave of backlash from every corner of the country and that included from President Donald Trump. His collusion lawsuit against the league was settled earlier this year.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear whether the workout on Saturday will be enough to convince a team to sign Kaepernick.</p>
      <p>Either way, he has people behind him.</p>
      <blockquote>“Hell yeah, that’d be dope,” Cowboys safety Byron Jones said about a possible Kaepernick return, via USA Today. “Of course. A big quarterback like that who can run and make plays outside the pocket? I remember in college watching him play like, ‘This dude’s amazing.’</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Hopefully he’s still got it.”</blockquote>
