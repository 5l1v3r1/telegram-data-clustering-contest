      <p>Leader of the Blue and White Party, Benny Gantz, criticized heavily his own party, including his his number 2, Yair Lapid.</p>
      <p><i>Channel 12 News</i> reported that in closed conversations Gantz said "because of Yoaz Hendel and Tzvika Hauser, I'm not Prime Minister, and because of Lapid there was no possibility of unity."</p>
      <p>Hendel and Hauser are part of Moshe Ya'alon's faction, the right wing of the Blue and White party, and they stopped Gantz creating a minority government with the Arab parties.</p>
      <p>Gantz <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271992">returned the mandate</a> to form the government to President Reuven Rivlin Wednesday evening.</p>
