      <p>Richard Gere urged Mirror readers to join him in planting trees around the world to fight climate change.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood A-lister warned how the environment crisis will be more “catastrophic than any war or disaster ever known”.</p>
      <p>The An Officer and a Gentleman star told how action has never been needed more “in the urgent quest to limit carbon emissions”.</p>
      <p>Planting a tree for us in Grabnik, outside Warsaw, Poland, the 70-year-old actor said: “We wholeheartedly support the Mirror’s campaign and for everyone to do the same in communities across Britain and the world.”</p>

      <p>The Tibetan Buddhist added: “We are all interdependent, and dependent upon this planet, our home.</p>
      <p>"The Dalai Lama’s home, Tibet – the roof of the world – is warming nearly three times as fast as the rest of the earth.</p>
      <p>“This matters to all of us. Tibet has the biggest reserves of freshwater outside the Arctic and Antarctic, and is the source of most of Asia’s major rivers.</p>

      <p>"Its changing climate affects not only the monsoon in Asia but <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> patterns in Europe and the rest of the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
      <p>“Tibet may be the canary in the coal mine.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dalai-lama-backs-mirrors-million-20917388">The Dalai Lama has praised the Mirror’s campaign</a> , saying planting trees is one thing people can do in a bid to avert climate disaster.</p>

      <p>Lama Rinchen, who heads up the Benchen Karma Kamtsang Buddhist Centre in Grabnik, added: “The Mirror campaign has inspired us here to plant more trees.”</p>
      <p>This week, monk Geshe Tenzin Namdak and teacher Tenzin Osel Hita planted trees at Jamyang Buddhist Centre, South London.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow marks the start of our fundraising with Trillion Trees, a joint venture of the world’s largest conservation charities – WWF, BirdLife International and Wildlife Conservation Society who are fighting deforestation.</p>
