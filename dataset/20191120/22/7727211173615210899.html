        <i>In the latest in our 'End of Decade' look at Everton, here we reflect on the club's all-time leading scorer in the Premier League, Romelu Lukaku.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And we ask if ever given the chance to re-sign the Belgian, should the Blues welcome him back with open arms or avoid a reunion?</i>
      </p>
      <p>It appears that Steve Walsh wasn't sad to see Romelu Lukaku leave Everton.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://theathletic.com/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">The Athletic</a> earlier this week the club's former director of football claimed he warned Jose Mourinho that he was buying a "big baby" when Manchester United paid £75m for his services.</p>
      <p>And six months after telling the Portuguese boss this - and having failed to sign Everton a replacement for their top scorer - Walsh declared to a packed General Meeting at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall: “If you took away all of Romelu Lukaku’s goals last season, we still would have finished seventh.”</p>
      <p>He was trying to make a point but, in fact, badly missed it, when it came to understanding what Lukaku brought to the team.</p>
      <p>Although it was a first public indication as to how he viewed the importance of the Belgian striker and why he felt he could fill the void. </p>
      <p>He couldn't.</p>
      <p>But how is Lukaku, the club's leading Premier League scorer of all-time, viewed by supporters? </p>
      <p>Would you have in back in a heartbeat, seeing him as the most lethal frontman Everton have had in the modern era?</p>
      <p>Or would you stay clear of a player who always saw Goodison as a stepping stone, who was never afraid to tell the world that he saw his future elsewhere and, recently, revealed he was talking to Chelsea mid-season?</p>
      <p>In his final season at Goodison, Lukaku hit 25 league goals, provided six assists and was one of the most in-form players in the country.</p>
      <p>The £28m signing from Chelsea would finish his Blues career having plundered 87 goals in 166 appearances, across all competitions.</p>
      <p>It's a strike-rate he's not been able to get close to since. </p>
      <p>And what seemed lost on Walsh, or what he may have been conveniently trying to ignore, was that Lukaku was more than just a poacher.</p>
      <p>Over the course of four full seasons with Everton, he also laid on 23 league goals, he could bully defenders, stretch defences and occupy more of the opposition than any one of his team-mates.</p>
      <p>Sure, he had to learn about pressing and his work off the ball, but Lukaku was powerful and lethal in front of goal.</p>
      <p>“He is world class in his finishing," Ronald Koeman said in early 2017.</p>

      <p>"He is that good but he needs to improve in a total picture of a player – but that part of him is world class."</p>
      <p>In the Premier League era, Everton have not come close to having anyone of his type and though the club signed some duff players under Roberto Martinez, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/romelu-lukaku-always-always-putting-17133269">the signing of Lukaku was one of the best pieces of business done</a> in recent times.</p>
      <p>His last two moves have seen clubs pay almost £150m and to buy a player, at his 2017 peak, now would probably cost that by itself - plus huge weekly wages.</p>
      <p>The Blues are not in a position to be spending those amounts of money on one man.</p>
      <p>But where Walsh may have a point was in his assessment of Lukaku's character.</p>
      <p>International breaks were met with an anxious expectancy that the young striker would blab to the media in his homeland about how he saw his future beyond the walls of Goodison.</p>
      <h3>Everton news and transfers <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-transfer-gossip-news-live-17284631">LIVE</a> - Krzysztof Piatek Moise Kean 'swap deal'</h3>
      <p>He was not shy at telling people about his ambitions. Was it up to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> to try and match those aims?  Absolutely. But did he tell people far too often? Yep.</p>
      <p>And if each break was worrying, then the summers were worse as the links with a host of top European clubs - Chelsea and Juventus usually - would rev up again.</p>
      <p>It always felt like Lukaku, who admitted to initially ignoring Martinez's calls in the summer of 2014, was on the brink of ending it with the Blues.</p>
      <p>Koeman had to convince him to stay in 2016 and even when the club offered to make him their highest paid player (it was 99.9% done remember?) he turned Eveton down.</p>
      <p>"If I tell you what we offered him you wouldn’t believe it," Farhad Moshiri said.</p>
      <p>His relationship with supporters was always mixed, even when he was at the club, and has since become strained since his departure. </p>
      <p>Lukaku's revelation about talking to Chelsea, in an interview over the summer, soured things further.</p>
      <p>Walsh was also discussing Lukaku and Paul Pogba, this week, when he said: "They aren't my type of players.  They are more about themselves than the team."</p>
      <p>Lukaku, though accused as a flat-track bully, was destructive on the pitch but, perhaps, too disruptive off it.  And that, for many, would be why Everton could never countenance the idea of having him back.</p>
      <p>For others, his goals have never been replaced and it's why the Blues should welcome him back with open arms, should it ever materialise.</p>
