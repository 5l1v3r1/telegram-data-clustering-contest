      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Make no mistake, there are nearly 900 colleges and universities that would like to have UW Madison's ranking for national research by the National Science Foundation.</p>
      <p>Being in the top 10 is nothing to sneeze at. UW Madison is still a research powerhouse with more than one-point-two Billion dollars in annual expenditures for research across all fields. But here are reasons for concern.</p>
      <p>In the 2018 rankings released last week UW ranks 8th, the second time in the last three years UW dropped in the rankings after being in the top five since 1972 when the annual survey began. UW should be in the top five and needs to get back there. One of the challenges is general misunderstanding, disinterest or even antipathy toward general research on behalf of some politicians that sends the wrong message about one the greatest strengths of the Wisconsin economy. Research is one of the foundations of the UW as a center of academic excellence, faculty recruitment and entrepreneurship. It demands support. </p>
