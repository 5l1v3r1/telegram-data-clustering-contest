      <h2>Labour is launching its general election manifesto with a plan to build 150,000 homes a year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker-NEC</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> will pledge to embark on a council and social housing “revolution” by constructing up to 150,000 homes a year, as it launches its election manifesto.</p>
      <p>Labour’s manifesto is set to include plans for the largest council house-building effort since the aftermath of the Second World War.</p>
      <p>The party says it will spend half of its £150 billion “social transformation fund” - borrowing which it would invest to repair the damage done by austerity - on house-building over five years.</p>
      <p>Charities and housing groups widely praised the proposal as a “game-changer”.</p>
      <p>At the launch in Birmingham, the Labour leader said: “Housing should be for the many, not a speculation opportunity for dodgy landlords and the wealthy few.</p>
      <p>“I am determined to create a society where working-class communities and young people have access to affordable, good-quality council and social homes.”</p>
      <p>Labour proposes to build 100,000 council homes a year by the end of its first parliament, which it says is an increase of more than 3,500% compared with currently under the Tories.</p>
      <p>Official housing statistics have shown more than one million households are on waiting lists for council housing.</p>
      <p>A further 50,000 “genuinely affordable homes” would be built each year through housing associations by the end of the same period.</p>
      <p>The building programme will only take place in England, with housing being a devolved matter for governments across the UK.</p>
      <p>Labour says the council house programme is the biggest since the efforts to rebuild Britain following the ravages of war, and the largest commitment to build affordable housing since the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The party also plans to scrap the Conservatives’ “bogus” definition of affordable housing to replace it with one that is linked to local incomes.</p>
      <p>Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery insisted the manifesto will be the “most radical” ever seen in Britain.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a campaign visit to support Gill Ogilvie, Labour’s candidate in Walsall North, Mr Lavery was cheered by party supporters as he told reporters: “Wait till tomorrow. I promise you, you will be excited by what the party has got to offer.</p>
      <p>“It’s the most radical manifesto probably this country has ever seen by any political party.”</p>
      <p>Other measures likely to be in the manifesto, based on statements Labour has made in the recent past, include:</p>
      <h3>NHS</h3>
      <p>Labour has pledged to outspend the Tories in the key battleground by spending an extra £26 billion to rebuild “crumbling” hospitals and improve patient care.</p>
      <p>A boost of an annual average of 4.3% in real-terms investment over the next four years has been promised to take the total Department of Health budget to £178 billion in 2023-24.</p>
      <p>Dental check-ups and prescriptions would also become free for everyone in England.</p>
      <h3>Brexit</h3>
      <p>Within three months a new deal with Brussels would be brokered, one that would see the UK remaining in the customs union and having access to the single market.</p>
      <p>Then, within six months of electoral victory, the deal would be put to the public in a referendum along with the option to remain in the EU.</p>
      <h3>Wages</h3>
      <p>The minimum wage would rise to £10-an-hour for everyone, including under-18s.</p>
      <p>This plan forms part of Labour’s war on poverty and its pledge to end the gender pay gap by 2030.</p>
      <h3>Utilities</h3>
      <p>There is likely to be the commitment to bring the rail network back into public ownership as current franchises expire.</p>
      <p>Bringing other utilities such as energy supply networks back into public control is also expected, as is the reversal of the privatisation of Royal Mail.</p>
      <p>Local authorities would be given the power to bring bus services back into public control.</p>
      <h3>Broadband</h3>
      <p>Every home and business would get free full-fibre internet by 2030 as Labour brings part of BT into public ownership to create a nationalised “British broadband service”.</p>
      <h3>Taxation</h3>
      <p>The top 5% of earners would pay more to fund public services, though the details are not yet clear.</p>
      <p>Labour would shut down “tax tricks” by going after multinational corporations with a tax on their sales, workforce and operations as a share of their global activity.</p>
      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>Every adult would be entitled to six years of free study as part of its “cradle-to-grave” national education service, which would scrap university tuition fees and boost technical training.</p>
      <p>Class sizes would be cut for five to seven-year-olds, 30 hours of free childcare would be given to all two to four-year-olds and new Sure Start children’s centres would be opened.</p>
      <h3>Working week</h3>
      <p>A 32-hour working week would be introduced within 10 years with no loss to workers’ pay. Labour expects this would be paid for by a boost to productivity.</p>
      <h3>Immigration</h3>
      <p>Freedom of movement would continue if Remain won another referendum under Labour. But, if Leave won again, restrictions could be imposed.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said he would not commit to “arbitrary” targets as he highlighted the necessity of migrant workers to the economy, particularly the NHS.</p>
      <h3>Environment</h3>
      <p>The climate crisis has been at the forefront of Labour’s thinking in most of its pledges as it tries to make the economy carbon neutral by an as-yet unknown year.</p>
      <p>But as part of its “green industrial revolution” it has also pledged 320,000 climate apprenticeships and billions in spending to upgrade every home to be energy efficient.</p>
