      <p>This week’s issue of Famitsu contained Masahiro Sakurai’s 592nd column. In it, Sakurai talked about the recent news that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Super+Smash+Bros.+Ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> had become the best-selling fighting game ever. This accomplishment previously belonged to Street Fighter II. Sakurai said that Japan considers Smash an action game. Despite Smash Ultimate’s achievement, Sakurai says that he still considers <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Street+Fighter">Street Fighter</a> II to be the king of fighting games. Sakurai also said that a fighting game, once mastered, may become stale. This is why, according to Sakurai, the series is designed closer to a party game.</p>
