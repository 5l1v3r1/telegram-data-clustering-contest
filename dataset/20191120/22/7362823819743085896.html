      <h1>Associated Press deletes tweet falsely claiming Trump contradicted Sondland's testimony with direct quote</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:15:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/obama-era-child-detention-statistics-trump-retractions">The Associated Press</a> was forced to take down a tweet that inaccurately claimed <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> had contradicted the testimony of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, despite Trump and Sondland using the same words.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-its-all-over-for-impeachment-inquiry-after-sondland-testimony">Speaking to reporters</a> before departing on a scheduled trip to Texas, Trump claimed Sondland's testimony meant "it's all over" for the proceedings and that the House inquiry into Trump needed to come to a halt.</p>
      <p>Trump then read from notes, "'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell [President Volodymyr] Zelensky to do the right thing.'" Earlier, Sondland testified that Trump previously said those words after the ambassador asked the president what he wanted from Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"It was a very short, abrupt conversation," the ambassador said. "He was not in a good mood, and he just said, 'I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.' Something to that effect."</p>

      <p>However, The Associated Press tweeted that Trump's remarks were "contradicting" Sondland's.</p>
      <p>"Contradicting the testimony of his own ambassador, President Trump says he wanted "nothing" from [Ukraine] and says the #ImpeachmentHearings should be brought to an end," the now-deleted tweet read.</p>

      <p>Critics slammed the news outlet for the inaccurate tweet.</p>
      <p>"This is not a contradiction. It is a direct quote from Amb. Sondland's testimony," Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMarkMeadows/status/1197205612158955522">reacted.</a></p>
      <p>"It’s a direct quote from Sondland’s testimony about his conversations with Trump, you incompetent liars," The Federalist co-founder Sean Davis wrote.</p>

      <p>After deleting the tweet, The Associated Press then <a href="https://twitter.com/AP/status/1197213387127754752">wrote</a> how Trump was "highlighting" Sondland's testimony, but adding that Sondland "said at other points that there was a quid pro quo involving" the Ukrainian government.</p>
      <p>The AP also <a href="https://twitter.com/AP/status/1197213947818061832">said</a>, "An earlier tweet that didn’t make clear that President Trump was quoting from Gordon Sondland’s testimony in which he was quoting Trump has been deleted."</p>
