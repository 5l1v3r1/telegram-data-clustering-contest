      <p>It's something ITV bosses certainly hoped for when they picked the former Girls Aloud singer to partake in I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle has finally spilled on her relationship with Cheryl Cole. In tonight's show of I'm A Celeb, Nadine sat by the Jungle creek with fellow campmates Jacqueline Jossa and Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>Talk quickly turned to Girls Aloud and it was Jacqueline who asked Coyle what it was like being in a girl band.</p>
      <p>Nadine responded by saying:</p>
      <p>“Really good, really good, I like being in a girl band.  I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I’m used to being around girls."</p>

      <p>Later in the conversation Jaqueline asked the Northern Irish beauty if she got along with everyone in Girls Aloud to which Nadine said "Yes".</p>
      <p>Jaqueline then went on to quiz Nadine on her relationship with Cheryl by offering "I’d heard you didn’t get on with Cheryl."</p>
      <p>The Derry native shot down the rumours, branding them as "fake news" and said "It wasn't a thing."</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud, who rose to fame in 2002, split for good in 2013. It was believed that Nadine and Sarah Harding had a falling out with former bandmates Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts.</p>
      <p>It was only recently Kimberley admitted they had "drifted apart" over the years. However, she did say she will be keeping up with I'm A Celeb and wants Nadine to "do well".</p>
