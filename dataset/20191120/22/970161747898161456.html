      <p>The Apprentice aired a shock twist during the boardroom scenes in the latest episode as Thomas Skinner put himself in the firing line.</p>
      <p>Thomas offered to take Pamela Laird’s place in the boardroom when project manager Ryan-Mark Parsons chose her and Marianne Rawlins to bring back.</p>
      <p>Pamela hit back at Ryan-Mark for choosing her, insisting that she had actually ‘saved’ the task, which saw the teams put on a corporate away day.</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark’s team lost by around £15 due to one client demanding a refund as there were no gluten-free options available at the event.</p>

      <p>Sat before Lord Sugar, he was asked to pick two candidates to bring back.</p>
      <p>He chose Marianne and Pamela, saying he would ‘justify’ why he chose Pamela later on.</p>
      <p>Thomas said: ‘I don’t think you should be bringing Pamela back at all.’</p>
      <p>‘I think you should rethink your decision Ryan-Mark I saved this task,’ Pamela added.</p>

      <p>When Lord Sugar asked Thomas if he wanted to take her place, he agreed: ‘I’m being serious because I won’t have it.’</p>
      <p>‘She should not be coming back in this room 100 per cent.’</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark gave in, saying: ‘Okay, well on that basis I’ll bring Thomas back if he wants to come back so desperately. I wouldn’t worry it’s fine.’</p>
      <p>Somehow Thomas managed to escape being fired yet again, despite being on the losing team for seven out of the eight tasks so far this series.</p>
      <p>In the end Ryan-Mark was fired, and the former candidate believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/the-apprentice-fired-candidate-ryan-mark-parsons-accuses-former-candidates-of-making-up-racism-claims-against-lord-sugar-11190310/">Thomas’ last minute act of gallantry saved his skin.</a></p>
      <p>He told Metro.co.uk: ‘If you look at Thomas, the only reason he was saved was because he decided to come back to the boardroom, I love Thomas but he has lost seven out of eight tasks and it was a disaster on his side.</p>
      <p>‘Marianne is a naïve person on task, who runs around in her own universe.</p>
      <p>‘And on task, she would be all over the place, she would be erratic and when it came to the boardroom she would attack you and be very condescending and patronising. She would really go for you.’</p>
