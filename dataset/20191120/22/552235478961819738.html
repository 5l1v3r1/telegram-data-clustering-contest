      <h1>Fraser Forster in Celtic contract vow as he reveals he has had NO contact with Southampton</h1>
      <h2>Goalkeeper is focused on securing 9 in a row.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:29:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:29</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Fraser Forster has revealed he’s had no contact with anyone at Southampton since returning to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> on loan.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper has rediscovered top form in spectacular style since penning a season-long deal in August after 18 months in the wilderness at the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>And he has dismissed fears he could be recalled to St Mary’s in January, insisting he is at the Hoops for the year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fraser-forster">Forster</a> is preparing for an extended run in the Europa League and a tilt at 9 in a row and another treble with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>’s side.</p>

      <p>But as the transfer window approaches and with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on a torrid run of form, fears are growing among the Hoops support that Ralph Hassenhuttl could recall the 31-year-old.</p>
      <p>However, Forster said: “I don’t think so. It’s a season long loan and I’ll be here until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>“I have not spoken to anyone (at Southampton) since I came up here. That’s just how football works.</p>
      <p>“I’m up here, I’m a Celtic player for the year and that’s fine. I just want to do as well for this club as I can. “I am loving being back and playing. I want to make the most of my time.</p>
      <p>“I had a tough year last year and the main thing was to get back to enjoying football and enjoying life again.”</p>
      <p>Forster admits he’s settled right back into the groove at Celtic and the club has put a smile back on his face.</p>

      <p>But with two-and-a-half years left on his Saints deal he knows his long-term future is out of his hands.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what it is about the place,” he said. “There are a lot of good people at the club and I work with a lot of good people.</p>
      <p>“The manager has been brilliant with me and I am working with a great goalkeeping coach in Stevie Woods.</p>
      <p>“I just love being here, I just enjoy it.”</p>
