      <p>CLINTON HILL, New Jersey (WABC) -- Police are investigating two shootings in Newark in less than two days that have left two people dead and five wounded.</p>
      <p>The latest shooting happened Tuesday night at a barbershop on Clinton Place.</p>
      <p>The Essex County Prosecutor's office said <a href="https://abc7ny.com/1-man-killed-2-wounded-in-shooting-at-newark-barber-shop-/5708207/">three people were shot</a> shortly before 8:40 p.m. at the Cut Creator's Enterprise.</p>

      <p>One person was killed and two others wounded, one of whom is said to be hospitalized in critical condition.</p>
      <p>The fatality was identified as 22-year-old Sabor Townes, whose father owns the shop where the shooting took place.</p>
      <p>Additionally, Newark police say an officer was assaulted while attempting to control a crowd that gathered at the scene.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/1-dead-3-wounded-after-shooting-on-street-in-newark/5705792/">four were people shot</a> - one fatally - in the 100 block of South 8th Street.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness said it sounded like a gun battle, with multiple people firing.</p>
      <p>Officials identified the fatality as 49-year-old Hassan Webb, who they say was caught in crossfire while walking home. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>"So he was a real fun-loving guy, dedicated to what he was doing every day, got up every day and went to work and he loved his wife," said nephew Rakim Singleton.</p>
      <p>Webb was known for helping to raise his nephews after their mother passed away years ago, and his love and patience helped to sustain the entire family.</p>
      <p>"So this is real close," said Singleton. "It's not like an uncle or nephew that you didn't see all the time. We grew up in the same household. He was only seven years older than me so we was real close."</p>
      <p>Relatives say Webb had just moved into the area recently with his wife of over 20 years.</p>
      <p>"This is like literally blocks from where he lived at," said Singleton. "And the crazy thing is that yesterday we had to go to the morgue to see if we could identify the body. And the morgue is directly across the street from where he lived."</p>
      <p>The other victims of Monday's shooting were taken to University Hospital, where they remain in stable condition. Police say the two shootings are not related.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to contact the Essex County Prosecutor's Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force tips line at 1-877 TIPS- 4EC or 1-877-847-7432.</p>
      <p>No arrests or suspects have been announced in either shooting, and Newark police continue to search for multiple gunmen.</p>
