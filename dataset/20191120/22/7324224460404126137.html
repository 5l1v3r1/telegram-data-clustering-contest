      <p>Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts had to eat duck tongues, dead cockroaches and turkey testicles in the latest stomach-churning I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! trial.</p>
      <p>The pair also had to chow down on fish eyes and a pig’s uterus in the Just Desserts challenge.</p>
      <p>In Wednesday’s instalment of the ITV show, the trial area was transformed into a jungle-themed ice-cream parlour.</p>
      <p>Host Declan Donnelly told the pair they had to take turns to eat 10 puddings, with each dish representing a meal for camp.</p>

      <p>Kemp got started with Critter-Bocker Glory – a vile concoction of dead cockroaches, mealworms and crickets, which he described as being “quite cheesy, cheesy eggs”.</p>
      <p>Roberts retched as she tried vomit fruit, telling herself it was “a Faberge (egg)”.</p>
      <p>“It’s like your dog’s been sick and you have to eat it,” she cried.</p>
      <p>Kemp tried to convince himself that duck tongues were really calamari, and Roberts swore off turkey for life after chomping turkey testicles. </p>

      <p>Referring to the fact that Roberts had brought a picture of Jane McDonald to camp as her luxury item, Kemp urged her to “think how proud” McDonald would be as she gagged while trying to eat a pig’s uterus. </p>
      <p>Kemp’s final dish was Cocky Road Ice Cream – or a bull’s penis. </p>
      <p>The pair managed to eat each of the “desserts” and earned a full 10 stars for camp.</p>
      <p>“Lovely first date. Thanks very much,” Roberts joked to Kemp afterwards.</p>
      <p>Their success meant the campers were treated to a feast of crocodile feet, mountain spinach, shimeji mushrooms, snake beans and horned cucumber with black sapote fruit for dessert.</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
