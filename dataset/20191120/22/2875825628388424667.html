      <p>Anthony Joshua insists he is still a champion, claiming: “I’m not about to become a p**** overnight.”</p>
      <p>Joshua has dismissed suggestions he has become psychologically damaged since his sensational first pro loss to Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>He claims he is still the same fighter who won Olympic gold and unified the WBA Super, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles before losing to Ruiz in June.</p>
      <p>Joshua is adamant one defeat cannot wipe away all that he achieved in the previous seven years as he prepares to face Ruiz again in Saudi Arabia on December 7.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t done anything differently mentally, I’m a champion,” he said defiantly. “I walked into the gym and three years later I was Olympic champion.</p>

      <p>“I’ve had one loss, but I’m not about to become a p***** overnight and not be able to fight.</p>
      <p>“I can fight, that’s it. I don’t need to reflect on that, I just need to win.”</p>
      <p>Joshua has had to listen to all sorts of criticisms in the months since his shattering loss to Ruiz at Madison Square Garden and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> claims he looked to him like he did not want to be there.</p>
      <p>The former heavyweight world king rejected Fury’s claim and says he does not know what’s going on inside his head because they are different fighters.</p>

      <p>“Of course I wanted to be there,” he said. “Tyson is at a different stage in his career.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always said he turned pro the year I had my first fight and he’s been pro 11 years, doing his thing.</p>
      <p>“What me and him deal with, he would never understand what I’m going through. That’s another entitled opinion, I was ready, I was in a good place.”</p>

      <p>Joshua, 30, appeared before the media yesterday at his training base at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, sporting a beard and longer hair, signs that he is totally focused on work.</p>
      <p>He looked leaner, but claimed he has not deliberately lost weight to be more mobile against the stocky Ruiz.</p>
      <p>He says he is using his sparring against the likes of Dereck Chisora and Bryant Jennings to gauge how heavy he should be for the rematch in Diriyah.</p>
      <p>“I leave it down to my sparring and how I prepare for the fight,” said Joshua, who is due to fly to Saudi Arabia at the weekend.</p>

      <p>“I’m not really focused on my weight, I’m just focused on my sparring.</p>
      <p>“I could weigh anything, but it just comes down to how I perform in the ring. I’m not interested in getting down or up to 110kg and then thinking I’m fit.</p>
      <p>“If I’m sparring 10 or 15 rounds at 120kg, then I’m good. The sparring gives me all the information I need.”</p>
