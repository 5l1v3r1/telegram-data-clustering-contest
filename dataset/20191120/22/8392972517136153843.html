      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> were left divided as Ian Wright and Andrew Maxwell clashed on tonight's show.</p>
      <p>After Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp won 10 stars in the Bushtucker trial earlier in the day, the camp were treated to crocodile feet for dinner.</p>
      <p>However, the meal seemed to cause a stir among the campmates as Ian snapped at Andrew after he tried to offer him more food.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline Jossa asked Ian: "Ian, do you want a bit of chicken?" as he shook his head to say no.</p>
      <p>Andrew cut in: "Ian, everybody has ate. There's two there. Go for it dude."</p>
      <aside>There's nothing more frustrating when you're saying no to something and someone continues to ask you.</aside>
      <p>Jacqueline asked the former footballer: "Which one do you want?" to which Ian said: "No I don't want none."</p>
      <p>Andrew said: "Come on seriously Ian."</p>
      <p>Ian replied: "I really honestly don't want no more. [James Haskell] needs it more than I would."</p>

      <p>Andrew said: "Jesus, the drama. Just eat some!" to which Ian snapped: "I said I don't want no more [expletive] crocodile bruv. I don't want no more!"</p>
      <p>In the Bush Telegraph, Ian said: "There's nothing more frustrating then when you're saying no to something and someone continues to ask you. It's annoying."</p>
