      <p>Israeli Consul in New York visited the scene of the attack where a <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/271970">Jewish man was stabbed in Monda</a>y Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dayan spoke with the commander of the local police force about the efforts to locate the assailant.</p>
      <p>The commander called the attack "an outlier" which does not represent the experience of the Jewish community of Monsey.</p>
      <p>Dayan noted the "rise of anti-Semitism all over the state, the country and the world ... In my wildest nightmares, I never imagined that when I came here to New York to represent Israel, I would have to go to eleven funerals in Pittsburgh."</p>
      <p>The victim was stabbed repeatedly in an attack on Howard Drive at approximately 5:40 a.m., while he was making his way to a local synagogue for morning prayers, <i>Yeshiva World News</i> reported. He was critically wounded.</p>
      <p>Police have not confirmed whether the attack was motivated by anti-Semitism.</p>
