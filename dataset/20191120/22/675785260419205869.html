      <p>A £310million property heiress who drunkenly spat in an officer’s face and kicked another policeman in the groin has avoided jail.</p>
      <p>Chloe Pidgley, 26, granddaughter of Berkeley Homes founder Tony Pidgley, pleaded guilty to the two assaults.</p>
      <p>A court heard the millionaire was unable to cope after her ex-boyfriend was jailed for throwing a radiator at her in a domestic incident.</p>
      <p>Pidgley admitted assaulting PCs Calum Jackson and Jake Harris, at her flat in Earl’s Court, West London, in March.</p>
      <p>They were called by the ambulance service after she made threats to self-harm.</p>
      <p>The court was also told she had four previous convictions, one for assaulting a police officer.</p>

      <p>But, yesterday, Pidgley, who was reportedly given a million pounds as a 21st birthday present, was sentenced to a community order and a fine of £245.</p>
      <p>Ricky Yao, defending, said: “This is a young lady who has had an exceedingly difficult time. Miss Pidgley suffered a serious assault on her person by an ex-partner. The week at the time of the incident was difficult for her as she had to deliver a victim-impact statement.</p>
      <p>“Her former partner was sentenced to 21 months... She was struck with a radiator and a door slammed on her hands, which caused significant injury.”</p>
      <p>Mr Yao added the heiress’s means were, “more modest than many may think”.</p>
      <p>At Hendon magistrates court, North London, judge Tan Ikram said: “I note your previous conviction of assault. That offence makes this offence more serious.</p>
      <p>“I also take into account what else was going in the days prior or at the time of this offence. You yourself were the victim of an attack.”</p>
      <p>The judge gave Pidgley a 12-month community order, with 100 hours’ unpaid work and 20 days’ rehabilitation to “explore your use of alcohol”.</p>
