      <p>There are currently 17 candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination – and they all come from markedly different financial backgrounds.</p>
      <p>Mayor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-pete-buttigieg-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Pete Buttigieg</a>, who is estimated to be worth about $100,000, gave up a comfortable consulting job for a life in public service. He and his husband have been also been open about being among the ranks of millennials still paying off student loan debt.</p>
      <p>Other contenders, like billionaire Democratic activist <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-tom-steyer-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-7">Tom Steyer</a> and former New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-michael-bloomberg-bio-age-family-and-key-positions-2019-11">Michael Bloomberg</a> are extraordinarily wealthy billionaires from success in the private sector. And most other candidates fall somewhere in between.</p>
      <p>The Democratic candidates who have recently run for federal office or served in Congress or another federal government position have filed personal financial disclosure forms listing their assets and liabilities.</p>
      <p>But because members are only required to report those figures in wide ranges, we don’t know the exact net worth of most of the candidates.</p>
      <p>And for others who haven’t recently filed any formal financial disclosures or released tax returns, we only have limited information about their salaries and assets.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything we know about the net worth and personal finances of every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, thanks to data collected by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2019/08/14/heres-the-net-worth-of-every-2020-presidential-candidate/#6aa2fbb637c5">Forbes</a>, the <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/topics/federal-politics/elections/presidential-profiles-2020/">Center for Public Integrity</a> and the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/">Center for Responsive Politics</a>.</p>
