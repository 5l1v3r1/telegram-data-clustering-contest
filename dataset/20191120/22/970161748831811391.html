      <p>The Apprentice’s Ryan-Mark Parsons has revealed he would definitely give <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here a go if he got approached by TV bosses – and it would be pure comedy gold.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old who was the latest candidate to be fired from the BBC show told <b>Metro.co.uk</b> that he’s ‘always up for a challenge’.</p>
      <p>‘I mean if ITV got in touch and wanted me in I would say yes, I am always up for a challenge and it would be comedy TV gold,’ Ryan-Mark began.</p>
      <p>The womenswear consultant continued that he’s already faced worse in The Apprentice than what he would come up against in the jungle.</p>
      <p>He laughed: ‘I was dealing with worse sharing a bed with Thomas Skinner that is worse than eating a kangaroo anus.</p>
      <p>‘Dealing with Thomas has actually prepared me for the jungle if it was to happen and I think it should happen.’</p>

      <p>The 19-year-old, who was i<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/13/apprentice-investigates-lottie-lion-racism-accusations-told-rival-shut-ghandi-10911610/">n the centre of a ‘racism’ storm at the beginning of this Apprentice series,</a> has been responding to fans on social media who are calling for her to go into the Australian jungle in 2020.</p>
      <p>And while the librarian has been retweeting the calls to ‘get her in the jungle’, she hasn’t responded as to whether she would take part or not.</p>
      <p>One questioned: ‘You like the idea then Lottie?’</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: ‘Lottie needs to be in I’m A Celeb next year’</p>
