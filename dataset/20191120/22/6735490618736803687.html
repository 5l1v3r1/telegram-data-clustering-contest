      <p>Matthew McConaughey is opening up about a terrifying experience he had with a venomous snake while vacationing Down Under.</p>
      <p>Chatting with Australia’s “Today” while promoting Wild Turkey bourbon and his new eco-tourism enterprise, the “Dallas Buyers Club” Oscar winner recalled a visit to Australia back in the 1980s when he encountered a venomous brown snake, one of the most lethal snakes in the world.</p>
      <p>During his chat with the show, McConaughey recalled almost stepping on a deadly brown snake. “I should have been bitten,” he said.</p>

      <p>“It was a bit dark,” he added. “It went right through my legs and gave me bit of a scare.”</p>
      <p>Luckily for McConaughey, a snake-savvy pal was on hand.</p>
      <p>“My friend came over and they caught it and said, ‘That’s a brown snake, mate… that could have really sucked.'”</p>
      <p>As he declared: “That’s [why it’s] my favourite animal, because it didn’t bite me!”</p>
