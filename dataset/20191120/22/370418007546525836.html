      <p>Prom: arguably the lamest night in any teenage metalhead’s life. While most squares see their high school prom as a chance to live out a fantasy of formal adulthood and maybe have condomless sex, metal fans know the night is better skipped altogether. Now, Paris Jackson, daughter of pop star Michael Jackson, has revealed that she bailed on her own senior prom for a very important reason: to see <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/metallica/">Metallica</a> live.</p>
      <p>The admission happens in a video for Vogue, in which Paris and her brother Prince are getting ready for an event celebrating 60 years of Motown. Paris is later changing into her second dress for the evening when she reveals that she abandoned the promise of vodka in a limo for Trapped Under Ice:</p>
      <p>“This is my second dress, and I feel like a princess,” says Paris. “I never actually went to prom — I skipped it to go see Metallica — so, uh, this feels nice. I would want my prom dress to look like this.”</p>

      <p>Paris also admits earlier in the video that she was once a hardcore Mötley Crüe fan, and describes her younger self as a “heavy metal head.”</p>
      <p>“You just started listening to Mötley Crüe, right?” Paris asks her brother. “I know you weren’t a huge fan when I was going through my insane phase…but now you’re really getting into the rock’n’roll bands I like.”</p>

      <p>Hopefully, Paris didn’t have tickets to see Metallica this year, given that the band had to <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/metallica-cancel-tour-as-james-hetfield-re-enters-rehab/">postpone their tour dates so that frontman James Hetfield could re-enter rehab</a>. However, she’ll have plenty of opportunities to do so later in 2020, as the band have announced that <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/metallica-announce-two-headlining-sets-at-every-danny-wimmer-festival-of-2020/">they’ll be playing two unique headlining sets at every single Danny Wimmer Presents festival of 2020</a>, the dates and locations of which are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Epicenter - May 1-3 - Concord, North Carolina</li>
        <li>Welcome To Rockville - May 8-10 - Daytona Beach, Florida</li>
        <li>Sonic Temple - May 15-17 - Columbus, Ohio</li>
        <li>Louder Than Life - Sept 18-20 - Louisville, Kentucky</li>
        <li>Aftershock - October 9-11 - Sacramento, California</li>
      </ul>
