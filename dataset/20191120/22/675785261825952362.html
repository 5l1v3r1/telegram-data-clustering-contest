      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> looked slimmer than ever as he stepped out for a date night with his stunning girlfriend Lauren Silverman.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> : Celebrity judge has recently dropped 20lbs thanks to a strict vegan diet.</p>
      <p>He shocked fans when he returned to screens looking much skinnier than the last time he'd been on TV.</p>
      <p>And it seems his weight loss is continuing.</p>
      <p>Simon was looking very trim when he stepped out tonight with Lauren.</p>
      <p>The couple, who share son Eric, five, headed to London's Shaftesbury Theatre to watch musical &amp; Juliet.</p>
      <p>Simon, 60, looked smart as a dart in a fitted grey suit with a navy blue jumper underneath.</p>

      <p>Lauren, 42, braved the cold as she bared her enviable pins in a stunning black velvet off-the-shoulder dress.</p>
      <p>Simon recently revealed he'd achieved his slender physique with a vegan diet.</p>
      <p>The music mogul spoke candidly about making changes to his lifestyle after he was hospitalised in October 2017 after he fainted due to low <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ten-ways-banish-high-blood-9621402">blood pressure</a> .</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://extratv.com/">Extra TV</a> in June, he said: "I went to see this guy who's very well-known. And he said to me, after doing some blood work, 'You can't have red meat, dairy, sugar, bread or gluten'."</p>

      <p>Simon said the first thing he asked about was whether or not he could drink alcohol.</p>
      <p>He said: "And he said, 'Maybe not quite as much as you had before'. And I did it and I stuck to it and it's easy."</p>
      <p>The star joked he was on the same diet as his little boy, saying: "Apart from ice-cream, he actually likes water, eats all his raw vegetable. I'm on the Eric Cowell diet."</p>
      <p>Simon recently confirmed that the celebrity version of his ITV talent contest will be returning for a second series, but that he may not stick with the broadcaster.</p>

      <p>He told new magazine: "As an idea we would be crazy not to do a second series.</p>
      <p>"Funnily enough, I've had an offer from another network to take it. So, to answer your question, it will be on next year."</p>
