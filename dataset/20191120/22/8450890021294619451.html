      <h2>The biggest technology acquisitions in 2019, including Google buying Fitbit, Salesforce picking up Tableau and ClickSoftware, and Apple snapping up Intel's smartphone modem business</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:12:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:12</time> by <a rel="author">Scott Carey</a></address>
      <p>In 2018 there was some major M&amp;A activity in the IT industry, topped by IBM's acquisition of Red Hat for a staggering $33 billion and Broadcom buying CA Technologies for $18.9 billion in cash.</p>
      <p>According to Deloitte's <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/mergers-acqisitions/us-mergers-acquisitions-trends-2019-report.pdf">annual study of M&amp;A activity</a> (pdf), 73 percent of tech sector executives expect even bigger deals this year - the highest percentage of any industry - but their acquisition strategies look likely to change.</p>
      <p>"Based on the latest survey results, there may be a pivot away from purchasing a company simply for its technology ... Instead, in the next 12 months, corporate respondents note an increased focus on buying a company in order to expand," the report read.</p>
      <p>Here are the most notable tech acquisitions of 2019 so far.</p>

      <h3>Mirantis acquires Docker Enterprise</h3>
      <p>Docker has <a href="https://www.mirantis.com/company/press-center/company-news/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/">announced</a> that it is selling its enterprise business to Mirantis for an undisclosed amount so that it can better focus on serving its developer community.</p>
      <p>It's a good fit for Mirantis, which helps companies run Kubernetes and OpenStack, as it can more seamlessly integrate its Kubernetes capabilities with the Docker Enterprise Container Platform, bringing together two industry-standard tools in the cloud-native era.</p>
      <p>Around 300 Docker employees will be moving to Mirantis, as will all its enterprise customers and partners. Docker will move its chief product officer Scott Johnston into the CEO role, leaving current CEO Rob Bearden out of a job again, having only joined from Hortonworks in May.</p>
      <p>“The Docker Enterprise employees are among the most talented cloud-native experts in the world and can be immensely proud of what they achieved. We’re very grateful for the opportunity to create an exciting future together and welcome the Docker Enterprise team, customers, partners, and community," Mirantis CEO Adrian Ionel said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Monitoring specialist Sumo Logic expanded its security capabilities in November with the acquisition of JASK Labs. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed but JASK had raised around $39 million in funding to date.</p>
      <p>The Austin, Texas-based company builds cloud-native autonomous security operations centre (ASOC) software, giving Sumo Logic a broader set of capabilities to better compete with rivals like Splunk. Its software essentially aims to automate key security analyst tasks to help them deal with the increased volume of security alerts.</p>
      <p>“Security in the modern world is moving from a human-scale problem to a machine-scale problem,” Ramin Sayar, president and CEO of Sumo Logic, said in a press release. “Customers are looking for a new approach to help them overcome the pain and complexity around an increasingly perimeter-less world. The JASK team are experts in helping customers navigate this new world. By aligning our efforts as a single team, we are able to democratise security intelligence for all.”</p>

      <h3>Google acquires Fitbit for $2.1 billion</h3>
      <p>Google has <a href="https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Fitbit-to-Be-Acquired-by-Google/default.aspx">announced</a> it is acquiring Fitbit for $2.1 billion. The deal is expected to go through in early 2020 following all of the relevant approvals. A company statement also promised that Fitbit will continue to work across Android and iOS.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based Fitbit designs and manufactures popular digital fitness trackers and has also branched into smartwatches to keep pace with rivals Apple and Samsung. It also provides corporate wellness programmes for businesses and a set of applications for users to track their fitness.</p>
      <p>James Park, cofounder and CEO of Fitbit, said in a statement: “Google is an ideal partner to advance our mission. With Google’s resources and global platform, Fitbit will be able to accelerate innovation in the wearables category, scale faster, and make health even more accessible to everyone. I could not be more excited for what lies ahead.”</p>
      <p>Google has its own wearable software platform – Wear OS – which Rick Osterloh, senior vice president for devices and services at Google, committed to in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/hardware/agreement-with-fitbit?_ga=2.135755441.1650641771.1572612162-1866699557.1548181445">blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>“By working closely with Fitbit’s team of experts, and bringing together the best AI, software and hardware, we can help spur innovation in wearables and build products to benefit even more people around the world,” he wrote. “Google also remains committed to Wear OS and our ecosystem partners, and we plan to work closely with Fitbit to combine the best of our respective smartwatch and fitness tracker platforms.”</p>

      <h3>Facebook acquires CTRL-labs</h3>
      <p>Facebook announced in September that it is acquiring CTRL-labs for somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/facebook-announces-acquisition-of-brain-computing-start-up-ctrl-labs.html"><i>CNBC</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The New York-based startup focuses on developing a 'brain-computer interface' via a proprietary software platform and wristband, and is a technology that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has <a href="https://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/social-media/17-things-we-learned-at-facebooks-f8-conference-3638269/">signalled a keen interest</a> in over the past couple of years. The startup team will join Facebook's Reality Labs division.</p>
      <p>“Technology like this has the potential to open up new creative possibilities and reimagine 19th-century inventions in a 21st-century world,” Facebook vice president of AR/VR Andrew “Boz” Bosworth wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz">Facebook post</a>. “This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.”</p>

      <h3>GitHub to acquire Semmle</h3>
      <p>GitHub announced in September that it is acquiring Semmle – a San Francisco-based startup which has built an analytics tool for software development process management – for an undisclosed fee.</p>
      <p>The Microsoft-owned GitHub will be looking to bake Semmle's code analysis capabilities into the GitHub Actions tool.</p>
      <p>GitHub CEO Nat Friedman wrote in a blog post that "one of the biggest issues facing developers today is how to create and consume open source in a secure and trusted way."</p>
      <p>Where Semmle comes in is with its "semantic code analysis engine", which "allows developers to write queries that identify code patterns in large codebases and search for vulnerabilities and their variants," according to Friedman.</p>
      <p>Existing Semmle customers include Uber, NASA, Microsoft and Google.</p>

      <h3>McDonald's acquires Apprente and Dynamic Yield</h3>
      <p>Fast food giant McDonald's followed up its $300 million acquisition of tech firm Dynamic Yield in March by picking up the Mountain View-based startup Apprente in September. The technology will be brought in house to transform McDonald's drive-thrus from human-operated to machine-operated, cutting down on human time and error when taking orders through the terminal.</p>
      <p>"We launched Apprente in 2017 with a mission to build the world’s best voice-based conversational system that delivers a human-level customer service experience," the cofounders Itamar Arel and Moshe Looks wrote in a <a href="https://www.apprente.com/">blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>"Order taking for drive-thrus at Quick Service Restaurants (QSRs) quickly emerged as a fantastic use-case for our proprietary AI technology. We’ve spent the past couple of years tackling this challenging real-world task, and along the way, we developed novel machine learning and speech understanding technologies, culminating in an industry-leading, robust and scalable solution."</p>
      <p>Dynamic Yield technology is also being focused on the drive-thru, with its "decision logic" system being used to customise outdoor digital Drive Thru menu displays based on the time of day, weather, current restaurant traffic, trending menu items and previous customer choices.</p>
      <p>Apprente will join the new McDonald’s Global Technology team, called McD Tech Labs, based in Silicon Valley.</p>

      <h3>VMware acquires Pivotal and Carbon Black for $4.8bn</h3>
      <p>Virtualisation specialist VMware announced in August that it will be acquiring platform-as-a-service vendor and fellow Dell family member <a href="https://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed.VMware-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Pivotal-Software.1905769.html">Pivotal</a>, and <a href="https://www.vmware.com/company/news/releases/vmw-newsfeed.VMware-Enters-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Carbon-Black.1905770.html">Carbon Black</a>, an anti-malware firm from Massachusetts, in a combined $4.8 billion deal.</p>
      <p>The $2.1 billion Carbon Black deal will see its team join VMware and its solutions will eventually be rolled into VMware's security portfolio, which includes AppDefense, NSX, SecureState and Workspace ONE.</p>
      <p>“The security industry is broken and ineffective with too many fragmented solutions and no cohesive platform architecture. By bringing Carbon Black into the VMware family, we are now taking a huge step forward in security and delivering an enterprise-grade platform to administer and protect workloads, applications and networks,” said Pat Gelsinger, CEO of VMware in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Pivotal deal is more complicated as Dell owns both firms. The proposed deal will involve a Class A share buyout of $15 per share, and Class B shares will be exchanged for VMware stock at a rate of 0.0550. The vendor calculates this as a $2.7 billion market value for the firm.</p>
      <p>“The time is ideal to join forces with VMware, an industry leader who shares our commitment to open source community contributions and our focus on adding developer value on top of Kubernetes,” said Rob Mee, CEO of Pivotal in a statement.</p>

      <p>Temenos wants to expand its reach in the US market and hopes this deal with the Texas-based firm can give it a foothold there.</p>
      <p>In terms of product, Temenos is looking to boost the functionality of its flagship Infinity product through Kony's Digital Banking Experience (Kony DBX).</p>
      <p>Max Chuard, Temenos CEO said in a statement that the acquisition will “allow us to grow both our US and our digital front office business faster, while being highly accretive and synergistic to the rest of our business."</p>

      <p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">announced</a> that it was acquiring Intel's smartphone modem business in July, in a move that should help the Cupertino-based company lower the cost of producing 5G-connected handsets, wearables and connected devices. Around 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple as a result.</p>
      <p>This deal won't have an immediate impact on customers, as Apple and Qualcomm signed a six-year licensing agreement with a multi-year chipset deal back in April, but it is acquiring a lot of expertise and intellectual property as a result.</p>
      <p>“Apple is excited to have so many excellent engineers join our growing cellular technologies group, and know they’ll thrive in Apple’s creative and dynamic environment. They, together with our significant acquisition of innovative IP, will help expedite our development on future products and allow Apple to further differentiate moving forward," Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies said in a statement.</p>

      <p>Uber is acquiring Middle Eastern ride-hailing competitor Careem for $3.1 billion ahead of the US company's impending initial public offering.</p>
      <p>Careem will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Uber, which will acquire all of Careem's mobility, delivery, and payments businesses across the greater Middle East region. The deal, which remains subject to regulatory approval in the 15 countries where Careem operates, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>Dr Shweta Singha, assistant professor at Warwick Business School, said the deal was further evidence of Uber's growing global ambition.</p>
      <p>"It had already acquired Jump Bikes, now it has acquired its biggest Middle Eastern rival Careem," he said. "It's clear that Uber is moving away from being a 'vanilla' car sharing company to becoming a one-stop shop, which connects end to end transportation.</p>
      <p>"The timing of this deal for Careem is significant, just days after Uber decided to launch its initial price offering (IPO). As well as the regular benefits of an acquisition, such as enhanced economies of scale and improved market reach, it will increase Uber's stock market valuation and that initial share price.</p>
      <p>"In strategy timing is everything. Acquiring Careem at the right moment shows that Uber has mastered the art of perfect timing."</p>

We’ve got some pretty clear privacy principles that we’ve used for developing all of our products, that are the really the underpinnings of everything. Those aren’t going to change.”</p>
      <p>Eero provides easy-to-use Wi-Fi routers that cover an entire home or apartment, which retail at $400. Amazon is initially eying the company's ability to make the installation of smart home devices simpler and will slot into the company's growing hardware division there.</p>

      <p>Mellanox makes everything from switches through to cabling and silicon for high-performance computing - making it a fit for Nvidia which has in recent years pivoted towards providing graphic chips for data centres, specialising in AI-assisted image analysis and creation.</p>
      <p>Nvidia founder Jensen Huang said: "The emergence of AI and data science, as well as billions of simultaneous computer users, is fuelling skyrocketing demand on the world's data centres. Addressing this demand will require holistic architectures that connect vast numbers of fast computing nodes over intelligent networking fabrics to form a giant data centre-scale compute engine."</p>
      <p>Mellanox's founder and CEO Eyal Waldman, meanwhile, said in a statement: "We share the same vision for accelerated computing as Nvidia. Combining our two companies comes as a natural extension of our longstanding partnership and is a great fit given our common performance-driven cultures. This combination will foster the creation of powerful technology and fantastic opportunities for our people."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion">announcement</a> from Nvidia pointed to previous collaboration between the two firms, such as with the US Department of Energy's two supercomputers, Sierra and Summit.</p>

      <h3>Palo Alto Networks to acquire Demisto for $560 million</h3>
      <p>Palo Alto Networks announced its intention to buy Demisto, a security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) specialist for $560 million in February.</p>
      <p>The intention will be to bring more machine learning capabilities to Palo Alto customers to improve threat prevention and detection and speed up response times to incidents. This will help the cybersecurity vendor compete with the likes of Splunk and UK upstart Darktrace.</p>
      <p>Demisto's product encompasses everything from a chatbot for SOC teams, to automated 'playbooks' to respond to certain incidents.</p>

      <h3>Spotify stakes its claim for podcasts</h3>
      <p>Spotify made a pair of acquisitions in February, both focusing on podcasts: the podcast creation platform Anchor, and content creator Gimlet Media.</p>
      <p>The terms were not announced but <i>CNBC</i> reported that Gimlet was being valued at $200 million pre-acquisition, and Spotify has talked about committing around $500 million in M&amp;A spend towards podcasts this year.</p>

          <b>Spotify stakes its claim for podcast supremacy with Gimlet and Anchor acquisitions</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-02-06/audio-first/">blog post titled 'Audio First',</a> Spotify CEO Daniel Ek wrote: "Gimlet is one of the best content creators in the world" and "Anchor has completely reimagined the path to audio creation, enabling creation for the next generation of podcasters worldwide — 15 billion hours of content on the platform during Q4."</p>
      <p>"Gimlet and Anchor will position us to become the leading platform for podcast creators around the world and the leading producer of podcasts," he added.</p>
      <p>Ek continued to detail how under the Spotify umbrella these two acquisitions will allow them to "offer better discovery, data, and monetisation to creators".</p>
      <p>"With the addition of Gimlet and Anchor, Spotify will now become the leading global podcast publisher with more shows than any other company," he concluded.</p>

      <h3>Twilio acquires SendGrid for $3 billion</h3>
      <p>Twilio made a major acquisition at the start of the year, purchasing SendGrid for approximately $3 billion. The acquisition was announced in October last year but didn't close until February 2019.</p>
      <p>Where Twilio specialises in cloud communications APIs, allowing companies to embed messaging and calling into their apps, SendGrid specialises in similar technology but focuses on email APIs instead.</p>
      <p>Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson said of the purchase: "Effective customer engagement is a strategic imperative for every company. With SendGrid now a part of Twilio, our goal is to provide a complete platform for every form of customer engagement.</p>
      <p>"Through our mutual developer-first approach, we empower the builders of the world to create magical customer experiences unique to every interaction."</p>
      <p>SendGrid will continue to operate as a standalone entity within Twilio, and CEO Sameer Dholakia will continue to lead that business unit.</p>

      <h3>Dropbox acquires HelloSign for $230 million</h3>
      <p>Dropbox acquired HelloSign in February, an e-signature and document workflow platform, for $230 million in cash.</p>
      <p>The purchase fits neatly into the Dropbox strategy of not just being a cloud file storage company, but to provide a digital 'hub' and help organisations streamline and digitise a lot of their business processes. Providing an e-signature capability will allow customers to, in theory, complete tasks like signing documents or contracts within a Dropbox workflow.</p>

      <p>"HelloSign has built a thriving business focused on esignature and document workflow products that their users love. Together, we can deliver an even better experience to Dropbox users, simplify their workflows, and expand the market we serve."</p>

      <h3>AWS acquires CloudEndure</h3>
      <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) got the year off to a fast start when it acquired Israeli cloud computing firm CloudEndure in January. Financial details were not announced but earlier that week Israel's <i><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/business/.premium-amazon-buying-israeli-startup-cloudendure-for-200-million-1.6822392">Haaretz</a></i> newspaper reported that Amazon was looking to buy CloudEndure for $200 million.</p>
      <p>"CloudEndure is now an AWS company. This acquisition expands our ability to deliver innovative and flexible migration, disaster recovery and backup solutions," the company <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudEndure/status/1083258144283942912">tweeted</a>.</p>

      <h3>Microsoft acquires Citus Data</h3>
      <p>Microsoft announced that it was acquiring Citus Data in January. The startup specialises in a commercial version of the popular open-source database PostgreSQL. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.</p>
      <p>It marks yet another move into the world of open source software for Microsoft after the splashy GitHub purchase last year and a changing internal attitude towards open source. Cities will help Microsoft build out its Azure Data Services with more database options.</p>
      <p>"Together, Microsoft and Citus Data will further unlock the power of data, enabling customers to scale complex multi-tenant SaaS applications and accelerate the time to insight with real-time analytics over billions of rows, all with the familiar PostgreSQL tools developers know and love," Microsoft announced in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2019/01/24/microsoft-acquires-citus-data-re-affirming-its-commitment-to-open-source-and-accelerating-azure-postgresql-performance-and-scale/">blog post</a>.</p>

      <h3>Facebook acquires Chainspace</h3>
      <p>Facebook acquired UK-based blockchain startup Chainspace in February, as reported by <i><a href="https://cheddar.com/media/facebook-blockchain-acquisition-chainspace">Cheddar</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Chainspace had yet to raise money and could well be an 'acqui-hire'. It was founded by a team of researchers from University College London (UCL) and had been developing a blockchain system using smart contracts to facilitate payments. Where this fits in at Facebook is something of a mystery.</p>
