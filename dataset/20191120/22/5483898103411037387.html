      <p><b>UPDATE, 8:54am:</b> CFS acting deputy chief Rob Sanford says the Yorketown fire’s “forward rates of spread have been halted on the outskirts of Edithburgh”.</p>
      <blockquote>He said the CFS could not yet confirm whether any properties had been lost in the fire and that he was “not aware” of any loss of human life.<br/><br/>He said 40 appliances and crews were on the ground and “still have a huge amount of work to do”.<br/><br/>“I’m sure they would’ve put themselves in harm’s way to make every effort to protect the communities.”</blockquote>
