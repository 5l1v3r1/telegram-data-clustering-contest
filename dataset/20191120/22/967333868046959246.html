        <b>Earlier, Yemen's Houthi militia claimed that their air defence systems had "intercepted" an F-15 fighter jet "belonging to the countries of aggression in Saada province." At the time, the Houthis did not detail the flag of the coalition warplane.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen, Lt. Col. Turki Al-Maliki, called the Houthi claims of intercepting and downing a Saudi aircraft “baseless and unfounded”, cited by the kingdom's state-owned <a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2001195">Saudi Press Agency (SPA)</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>Al-Maliki noted that what <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911201077362006-yemens-houthis-claim-they-shot-down-warplane-of-saudi-led-coalition/">was published earlier</a> in the day was in reference to a previous and unsuccessful attempt that took place on 1 July, 2018, describing the newly made claim by the Houthis as "a continuation of its deliberate falsification methodology”.</blockquote>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Houthi militia alleged that they had "intercepted" an F-15 jet belonging to a Saudi-led coalition member force.</p>
      <p>Yemen's armed Houthi political opposition faction have repeatedly claimed responsibility for attacks on Saudi's planes, drones and facilities.</p>
      <p>The latest major attack - which Houthis have also claimed responsibility for - occurred on 14 September, after combat drones caused major damage and fires at two major oil facilities run by the kingdom's state-owned Saudi Aramco petrochemical giant. The September attack reportedly interrupted and suspended the nation's oil production for over a week.</p>
      <p>Yemen <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911021077208961-houthis-demand-sudan-withdraw-from-arab-coalition-in-yemen/">has been engulfed</a> in a violent conflict between the government headed by Yemeni President-in-exile Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi and the Houthi opposition movement, also known as Ansar Allah.</p>
      <p>Since March 2015, a Saudi-led military coalition of mostly Persian Gulf countries <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910251077151589-yemeni-houthis-advance-on-govt-positions-in-saada-governorate-near-saudi-border---military-source/">has been carrying out</a> airstrikes against the Houthis at Hadi's request.</p>
      <p>The conflict in Yemen has been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201909031076716259-united-nations-accuses-complicity-yemen/">described by the United Nations as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis</a>, with nearly 80 percent of the 24-million-strong population currently in need of aid and protection.</p>
