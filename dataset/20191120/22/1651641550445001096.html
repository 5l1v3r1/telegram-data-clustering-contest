      <h1>Slack does the maths, says Teams still sucks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:27:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:27</time> by <a rel="author">Surur</a></address>
      <p>Microsoft recently announced that its Microsoft Teams enterprise collaboration product have not only overtaken competitor Slack <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-teams-has-hit-20-million-daily-active-users-nearly-8-million-more-than-slack/">but has added 7 million extra users in only 4 months</a>.</p>
      <p>Bragging about engagement, Microsoft also noted:</p>
      <blockquote>For instance, last month Teams customers participated in more than 27 million voice or video meetings and performed over 220 million open, edit, or download actions on files stored in Teams.</blockquote>
      <p>Illustrating the danger of providing solid numbers Slack did a bit of simple maths and showed that Teams engagement is nothing to write home about.</p>
      <p>Slack notes with 20 million active Microsoft Teams users, that only means about 1 monthly voice/video call and around 11 monthly file actions per daily active user.</p>
      <p>“As we’ve said before, you can’t transform a workplace if people aren’t actually using your product,” a Slack spokesperson<a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/222378/slack-claims-higher-engagement-than-microsoft-teams"> told Thurrott.co</a>m. “Slack continues to see unmatched engagement on our platform with 5+ billion weekly actions, including 1+ billion mobile actions. Among our paid customers, users spend more than 9 hours per workday connected to our service, including spending about 90 minutes per workday actively using Slack.”</p>
      <p>Slack has previously said its users were more engaged, and because Teams was bundled with Office, Microsoft’s numbers were “a little bit misleading in terms of what you’re measuring.”</p>
      <p>As an organization which has used both Teams and Slack, I can only agree that Teams is a confusing hot mess which we eventually abandoned, while Slack at its simplest is just a traditional chat room.</p>
      <p>In the end, the better product may not win out. After Microsoft’s announcement on Tuesday Slack lost nearly 10% of its share price and is currently trading at close to 50% of its IPO launch of $38 per share.</p>
      <p>At one time Microsoft considered buying Slack for around $7-8 billion, but in the end decided to build the own version.</p>
