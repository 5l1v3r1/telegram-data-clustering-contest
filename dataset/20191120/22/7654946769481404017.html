      <h1>FBI wants to interview whistleblower in Trump impeachment effort: report</h1>

      <p>The FBI is reportedly looking to interview the whistleblower whose complaint about President Trump’s Ukraine call sparked the ongoing House impeachment proceedings.</p>
      <p>The federal agency has twice reached out to the whistleblower’s legal team requesting their cooperation in a probe that appears to be in its infancy stages — but which the whistleblower doesn’t appear to be the target of, people familiar with the situation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fbi-seeks-interview-with-ukraine-whistleblower-11574271572">told The Wall Street Journal.</a></p>
      <p>It’s unclear exactly why the feds want to talk to the whistleblower, and the agency didn’t respond to a request for comment from the paper.</p>
      <p>The request from the FBI was described as a “polite ask,” the paper said.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower, reportedly a member of the intelligence community, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/26/whistleblower-complaint-against-trump-released/">filed a complaint</a> on Aug. 12 about Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in which he asked for probes of Joe Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine’s purported role in the 2016 elections.</p>
      <p>Republicans, including Trump, have made <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/03/trump-wants-whistleblower-identified-calls-impeachment-a-scam/">repeated calls for the whistleblower</a> to reveal himself and testify as a material witness in the impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for the whistleblower, Andrew Bakaj, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
