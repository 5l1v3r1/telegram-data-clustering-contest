          <b>Setting goals and working hard to achieve them not only sets one on the path of living a purpose-driven life, but also makes one attain success. This was the focus at the 2018/2019 Prize Giving Day at Corona Secondary School Agbara, Ogun State, CHINAKA OKORO reports</b>

      <p>Fayobomi Olusola-Falodun, a Year 12 student of Corona Secondary School, Agbara, will for some time to come, bask in the euphoria of  winning the ‘Principal’s Special Award’ for her outstanding commitment in adding value to her fellow students and her polymath.</p>
      <p>Like Olusola-Falodun, Mr. Solomon Owolabi, is still celebrating his choice as the ‘Corona Secondary School Best Teacher of the 2018/2019 Session Award’. He also won the ‘Most Dedicated Teaching Member of Staff Award’.</p>
      <p>They were honoured at its annual Speech and Prize Giving Day which held on Sunday, November 17, at the sprawling premises of the school located at Agbara in Ogun State.</p>
      <p>Olusola-Falodun expressed great delight at the recognition bestowed upon her by the Principal, a feat she described as unexpected.</p>
      <p>She said: “I didn’t see this coming; I was just doing what I was supposed to do. I didn’t even notice that I was being observed by the Principal.</p>
      <p>“I am very excited about this award and I want to appreciate the students, members of staff and everyone at Corona for making this possible. I don’t think I am better than other students who also do some of the things I do. But I must appreciate the Principal for counting me worthy of the prize.”</p>
      <p>She praised the commitment of academic and non-academic members of staff who had continued to put the school on the global map of success. Of significance are the successes recorded by the school, which include the ACCA Foundation Level passed by 10 of the students during last session’s SAT, two students scored 1,550 out of the attainable 1,600; making it the second highest SAT score in the world while many students who scored above 300 in the last Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination and an average score of 272.</p>
      <p>From junior to senior classes, awards were given to students who have performed excellently in their academic pursuits. Those that have made the school proud at both national and international levels were also rewarded.</p>
      <p>Members of staff were not left out. From the non-academic members of staff to academic members of staff, excellence, outstanding and selfless services, among others, were rewarded. Students sang praises of the efforts of all their teachers.</p>
      <p>In competitions within the country, the school just received a plague from the Association of International School Educators of Nigeria (AISEN), won the United States (US) Consulate History competition for the ‘Worlds Women History Month’ and capped it with ‘National History Competition for Nigeria.</p>
      <p>In the academic awards category for the 2018/2019, the school showcased the best top three in various years ranging from year seven to year 11.</p>
      <p>In year seven, Oluwamurewa Fadare led with a cumulated 95.61 per cent, followed by Chisom Ike with a cumulated 92.22 per cent while the third position went to Samuel Marquis with 91.28 per cent.</p>
      <p>In year eight, Oyindoubra Akika led with 93.35 per cent, followed by Ogechukwu Alloh with 88.94 per cent while third position went to Iman Ibrahim Imam with 86.88 per cent. Top on the least of year 10   was Tamaramiebi Akika with 92.00 per cent followed Jay Esemudje with 91.91 per cent while the third position in that category went to Zara Okoli with 85.64 per cent.</p>
      <p>In the year 11 category, Olumosope Kayode came tops with 91.30 per cent, Gbenuola Olaiya came second with 90.80 per cent while the third position went to Ifeoma Osakwe who scored 89.70 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Salako-Oyedele said: “Today is another opportunity to reward children that are doing well. I am particularly glad at the academic achievements and other achievements recorded in other sectors such as sports, drama, art and most importantly, the “Principal’s Award” which is for the most improved student. This sort of creates the total child.</p>
      <p>“Education is something that is very important to the government of Ogun State, and to this effect, his Excellency, Dapo Abiodun is doing a lot of work,” she said.</p>
      <p>Corona Secondary School Board Chairman Niyi Yusuf said the occasion was to “celebrate and recognise the performances of outstanding students and members of staff in terms of academics, behavioural, sports, clubs and associations. And the point we are trying to make with the theme is that excellence is in all students, we only need to find it.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The Head-Boy, Gbenuola Olaiya, said the highest point for him was the recognition of teachers. He said: “They do a lot to ensure that we are at our best, and they hardly get the glory; we do. Hence, I am grateful to them and glad that the management also recognised their efforts.”</p>
      <p>The occasion was not for students and teachers alone. Experts and captains of industry were pulled to the school to admonish its students on how to aim and achieve success in life. This year’s theme was “Redefining Success.”</p>
      <p>Aside students, parents and members of staff of the school who attended, other personalities were also present. They included several captains of industry and dignitaries such as the Deputy Governor of Ogun State, Mrs. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, guest speaker cum Chairman on the occasion, Mr.  Rotimi Ashley-Dejo. Incidentally, Ashley-Dejo is the Founder/Chief Executive Officer of Girafit.com. Other dignitaries present were Mr. Dotun Suleiman and Mr. Niyi Yusuf, among others.</p>
      <p>The Principal, Corona Secondary School, Mrs. Chinedum Oluwadamiloa, noted that though, true success comes from hard work and dedication, the school was also very keen at other aspects of successes.</p>
      <p>She said: “This is a time where we, as members of staff and students, come together to applaud our achievements and efforts, and for recognising those individuals-teachers and students and other members of staff-who have given a touch of excellence to what they do; who have distinguished themselves by going the extra mile and breaking standing records.</p>
      <p>“This recognition hinges on behavioural and academic excellence, as well as sports, clubs and so many other areas. It is based on sound psychological principle of reward and reinforcement.</p>
      <p>“Success is such a misconstrued phenomenon; hence the need to situate what it is in the right perspective. True success is what comes from hard work. There is no such thing as overnight success.</p>
      <p>“There is a common misconception which equates success with a mere improvement on a previous record. While we concede to the fact that, improvement will be part of success, we contend that it does not define it.</p>
      <p>“Our understanding is that, success involves setting a goal and taking the right steps towards accomplishing it with later life focus and unfettered success and determination. It is a combination of those steps.</p>
      <p>“And like we say to our students regularly, you are never going to be able to score a goal until you take a shot. You cannot sit on the sideline and suddenly begin to score goals; you have to take that shot and that is what success is about.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on “Not too Early to Start”, Deji-Ashley encouraged students to see the need to start aspiring to be successful at tender ages.</p>
      <p>He made inferences with notable achievers such as Thomas Jefferson, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Copeland and Ben Carson, all of who, he said became achievers cum inventors at very tender ages of between eight and 15 years.</p>
      <p>He said: “Nobody sees you when you decide to be successful until you attain success. This tells you that success goes beyond that decision. The decision is just the beginning.</p>
      <p>“And the first key to success is to discover what you are good at and try your best at it. Our lives are a series of successes and failures. But if you don’t try something, you can never know if you can attain success in it or otherwise.”</p>
      <p>He also invalidated the notion that poor academic performance is caused by students’ participation in extra-curricular activities. On the contrary, he maintained that “from research, students who engage in extra-curricular activities are also the high flyers academically.</p>
      <p>“However, parents’ job is to help them manage their time effectively and not to stop them from engaging in extra-curricular activities. Parents should stop choosing careers for their children. Your job is to guide them in choosing what they are best at. That way, they can glow and become successful in their chosen careers.”</p>
      <p>On the prizes he said: “Those who were not rewarded today, it doesn’t mean that they are less successful, as everyone is a success at something,” even as he stressed the need for them to believe in themselves and devise a new strategy to achieve their set goals.</p>
