      <p>Help improve Atlas Obscura by <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-blue-plaque-of-mrs-blunden/edit">expanding The Blue Plaque of Mrs Blunden</a> with additional information or photos.</p>
      <p>In 1674, Mrs. Blunden lived in Basingstoke along with her husband, a wealthy and respected merchant. </p>
      <p>One evening while her husband was away trading in London, she was accidentally given a large quantity of poppy syrup, instead of her usual spirits. Shortly after drinking the concoction, Blunden fell unconscious. Her maids believed she was in a deep sleep, however, after a few days of waiting to see if she would come to, Blunden was declared dead by a physician. </p>
      <p>The following evening her body was interred inside the family vault, not far from the Holy Ghost Grammar School. In the days following her burial, a pair of boys heard ghastly sounds coming from the vault. When other boys from the school had similar stories the coffin was exhumed.</p>
      <p>Inside Mrs. Blunden was covered in bruises and self-inflicted wounds, leading many to believe that she was alive when buried and attempted to escape. Her body was then examined by three different doctor’s, at that point she was once again declared dead and placed back into the vault. </p>
      <p>Today, a blue plaque found on a wall in the Holy Ghost cemetery remembers this medical blunder. It also indicates that the town was fined for negligence by Parliament. </p>
