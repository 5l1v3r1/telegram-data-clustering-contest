      <p>“<a href="http://insider.com/category/avengers-infinity-war">Avengers: Infinity War</a>” could have featured the Marvel superheroes going up against versions of themselves.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines">an interview with Vanity Fair’s Anthony Breznican</a>, “Infinity War” and “Endgame” screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely recount one of many alternate sequences in “Infinity War” that would have showed the heroes in a parallel world to their own.</p>
      <p>“There was a sequence in the first movie where they went into the places in the ‘Doctor Strange’ universe called the Mindscape and everyone faces themselves,” said Markus.</p>
      <p>There’s a scene in the 2016 movie where the Ancient One sends Strange through a number of dimensions. It sounds like the Avengers would have entered this.</p>

      <p>“Banner meets the Hulk, I think in the arena from ‘[Thor] Ragnarok.’ Only one of them was getting out of there, and then that one showed up in Wakanda.”</p>
      <h3>Why didn’t we see it in the final movie?</h3>
      <p>“It was great but had absolutely nothing to do with anything,” said Markus.</p>
      <p>It sounds like we were better off with the version of “Infinity War” that made it to theaters.</p>
      <p>The sequence does sound a bit wacky and bloated if it would have revisited another Marvel movie. The version of the film Markus and McFeely described would have had the Hulk emerge as Smart Hulk by the end of his battle. That’s something we’ve heard before that was scrapped and revisited at the start of “Endgame.”</p>
      <p>Maybe we’ll see the Avengers fight versions of themselves somewhere in the future.</p>
