      <p>TEHRAN: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday (Nov 20) that the country's people had defeated an "enemy conspiracy" behind a wave of violent street protests and were celebrating their victory.</p>
      <p>He blamed the days of unrest on "armed anarchists" who took to the streets "based on a plot that the region's reactionary, the Zionists and Americans had hatched," referring to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the US.</p>

      <p>The demonstrations erupted in the sanctions-hit Islamic republic on Friday after an announcement the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200 per cent with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Motorists blocked major roads in Tehran before the unrest spread rapidly to at least 40 urban centres, with petrol pumps torched, police stations attacked and shops looted.</p>
      <p>Officials have confirmed five deaths, including of three security personnel stabbed by "rioters".</p>
      <p>Thousands of mourners chanted "Death to America" at the funeral procession Wednesday for one of those killed, a Revolutionary Guard commander, in Shahriar, west of Tehran.</p>
      <p>The UN has voiced alarm at reports of dozens of deaths, and Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed.</p>
      <p>The London-based rights group added that "the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed".</p>
      <p>The full extent of the bloodshed was difficult to ascertain given a near-total internet blackout now in its fourth day.</p>

        <b>"ARMED ANARCHISTS"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rouhani told a cabinet meeting that "our people have been victorious against... the enemy's conspiracy.</p>
      <p>"Those anarchists who came out to the streets were few in number," he said, insisting that "this is the biggest display of the power of the nation of Iran."</p>
      <p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had said earlier also that "the recent actions were security issues, not from the people.</p>
      <p>"We have repelled the enemy."</p>
      <p>Days ago Khamenei had blamed foreign opponents of Iran's establishment for the unrest - among them the Pahlavi royal family ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the People's Mujahedeen of Iran group, which Iran considers a "terrorist" cult.</p>
      <p>At the funeral in Shahriar, mourners marched behind a truck carrying his coffin, clutching portraits of the slain Guard as well as posters that read "Down With USA".</p>
      <p>As they marched, they passed buildings gutted by fire, including a bank, post office and shopping centre.</p>
      <p>Morteza Ebrahimi was one of three security personnel who officials say was killed by "rioters" wielding knives and machetes.</p>
      <p>The others were members of the Basij, a militia loyal to Iran's establishment.</p>
      <p>State television, which rarely shows any signs of dissent in Iran, again aired footage on Tuesday night of the unrest in cities including Tehran and Shiraz.</p>
      <p>The UN human rights office Tuesday said it was alarmed by reports live ammunition had been used against protesters and caused a "significant number of deaths".</p>
      <p>But spokesman Rupert Colville cautioned that casualty details were hard to verify, in part because of internet restrictions.</p>
      <p>"We urge the Iranian authorities and security forces to avoid the use of force to disperse peaceful assemblies," he said.</p>
      <p>Colville also called on protesters to demonstrate peacefully, "without resorting to physical violence or destruction of property".</p>
      <p>
        <b>US WARSHIPS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Iran's economy has been battered since May last year when President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions.</p>
      <p>Tensions have soared this year, with the US widening its sanctions to include Khamenei, the Guards and other key entities as Iran scaled back its nuclear commitments.</p>
      <p>The arch-foes came to the brink of a military confrontation in June when Iran downed a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory strikes before cancelling them at the last minute.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the US aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln sailed through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway separating Iran and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>Iran, which controls much of the strategic waterway, regularly threatens to shut it down if its enemies commit hostile acts.</p>
      <p>Last week's surprise fuel price hike was agreed by an economic council made up of the president, parliament speaker and judiciary chief.</p>
      <p>Rouhani has defended the move, pledging its proceeds would go to the needy.</p>
      <p>In his remarks on Wednesday, he said the first payments had been made to more than seven million Iranians, and that in total 18 million people would get handouts by Saturday.</p>
