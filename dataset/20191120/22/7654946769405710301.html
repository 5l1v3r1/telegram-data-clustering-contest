      <p>She’s still baby-faced.</p>
      <p>The original Gerber baby — pictured on the iconic little glass jars of mushed up food — celebrated her 93rd birthday Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Ann Turner Cook, now a great-grandma, was only four months old in 1927 when a family friend, Dorothy Hope Smith, sketched a charcoal drawing of the angelic-looking child from Tampa Bay, Fla.</p>
      <p>Smith entered the adorable drawing in a Gerber contest asking for submissions for the new face of the company.</p>
      <p>“I was a happy, healthy baby, and I think that’s why the drawing has been so appealing to people,” Cook <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/original-gerber-baby-tampas-ann-turner-cook-turns-93">told FOX 13</a> in 2013. “Because everybody wants their baby to be happy, healthy-looking.”</p>
      <p>Smith was initially convinced that her work wasn’t up to snuff, but Gerber judges were sold and trademarked the drawing in 1931.</p>
      <p>She “wrote me [later] that she had thought it was kind of unfinished, and if they liked it, she could finish it properly,” Cook <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/tampa-native-original-gerber-baby-turns-90-years-old-today/">told WFLA</a> in 2016. “But they were smart enough that they didn’t want anything done to it.”</p>
      <p>Although Cook’s cherub-like face was plastered on millions of jars and distributed all over the United States, she kept her own baby-face private until 1978 for Gerber’s 50-year anniversary.</p>
      <p>Once the secret came out, students at Tampa’s Hillsborough HS — where she taught English — couldn’t stop asking questions about the Gerber queen, FOX 13 reported.</p>
      <p>“And then I would say, ‘Now we won’t talk about this anymore,’ because I didn’t want it to monopolize the time I had with my students,” she said.</p>
      <p>After 26 years of teaching, Cook became a mystery novelist and published books like “Shadow Over Cedar Key,” “Homosassa Shadows,” “Trace Their Shadows” and “Micanopy in Shadow.”</p>
      <p>Luckily, Cook is also a big fan of babies herself.</p>
      <p>“I had four of my own,” she told FOX 13. “There’s nothing I’d rather be than associated with babies.”</p>
      <p>Although it’s not known how she rang in her third year as a nonagenarian, she knows her image will live on forever.</p>
      <p>“That’s my immortality, yes,” she laughed. “I’ve become a symbol for babies, which couldn’t be anything nicer than that.”</p>
