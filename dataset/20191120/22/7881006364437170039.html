      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) workers unions on Wednesday decided to call off their ongoing strike if the government allows all striking employees join the duty unconditionally.</p>
      <p>Announcing the TSRTC joint action committee’s decision here on Wednesday, JAC convenor Ashwathama Reddy said “We are ready to call off the strike if the government allows the workers to join the duty unconditionally. The government should also not force workers to give any undertaking against participating in the strike in future.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The RTC employee unions were on strike from October 5 demanding the state government fulfil a charter of demands, which also included the merger of the corporation with the state government. Currently, TSRTC is a corporation, which is jointly owned by state and central governments.</p>
      <p>The RTC JAC leaders issued a joint statement after a detailed meeting where they discussed the future course of action in the light of the Telangana High Court’s judgment to refer the issue of strike to labour court.</p>
      <p>While expressing hope that the government would take the JAC’s offer to withdraw the strike positively, the JAC leaders requested the state government and the RTC management against taking any action against the striking workers.</p>
      <p>They insisted that it was the RTC management’s responsibility to build confidence among the workers to ensure the corporation runs smoothly.</p>
      <p>As many as 27 RTC employees have died since the strike began on October 5 allegedly in fear of losing their jobs after Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announced sacking of all those who failed to rejoin the duty by October 6.</p>
