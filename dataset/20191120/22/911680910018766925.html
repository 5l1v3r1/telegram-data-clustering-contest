      <p>MESA, AZ â€” A man allegedly offered a Mesa detective a $15,000 bribe after being arrested for stealing a UTV.</p>
      <p>Mesa police report that on November 13, they received information saying Lowell Edward Smith, 64, and Eric Reese Woods, 47, had a stolen 2019 RZR UTV in their possession.</p>
      <p>Court records show that detectives were watching as Smith and Woods set up ramps onto a large U-Haul truck, before driving the UTV into the truck.</p>
      <p>Police say the UTV appeared to be brand new and is worth about $26,000.</p>
      <p>Officers stopped Smith and Woods, who both allegedly admitted to knowing the UTV was stolen. Police say they were transporting it to another location to sell to a buyer for $2,700.</p>
      <p>As Woods was being taken to jail, he told the detective that he would be getting $15,000 soon and offered to "throw some money" his way, according to police.</p>
      <p>Woods and Smith have been charged with vehicle theft and trafficking stolen property. Woods is facing an additional charge of bribery.</p>
