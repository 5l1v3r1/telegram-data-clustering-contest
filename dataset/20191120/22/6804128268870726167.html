      <h1>How the Tottenham squad paid tribute to Mauricio Pochettino after he was sacked</h1>
      <h2>Spurs news | The Argentine left White Hart Lane on Tuesday evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:04:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:04</time> by <a rel="author">Amie Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is no longer the head coach at Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>After a poor start to the Premier League season, Spurs Chairman Daniel Levy took to decision to relieve the Argentine of his duties after five and a half seasons at the club.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has since been appointed as his successor, with the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss tasked with turning the season around and to try and bridge the gap to the top four in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>However, despite leaving with the team in bad form, Tottenham achieved a lot under Pochettino, most notably, reaching the Champions League final against Liverpool at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>The former manager also led the club to four consecutive top four finishes in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>But, as the two parties parted company, players in the Tottenham squad, including striker Harry Kane and defender Juan Foyth took to social media to pay tribute to their former coach.</p>
      <p>Many wrote heartfelt messages thanking the boss for how he has helped them in their career.</p>
      <p>Take a look at what the players have posted on social media below:</p>
