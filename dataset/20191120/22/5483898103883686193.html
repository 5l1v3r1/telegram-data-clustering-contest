      <h3>A Yorke Peninsula local has told FIVEaa Breakfast the Edithburgh town hall is still standing after it was feared burned down after fire threatened the township in the early hours of Thursday morning.</h3>
      <p>Edithburgh plumber Terry Nelhams told David and Will:</p>
      <blockquote>“Seems to be all right. I think they’ve pretty well got it all contained. There’s still a few aircraft up going around in circles. We’re back home now and there doesn’t seem to be any damage to the town whatsoever. Looks like we had a close one but it’s all good…<br/><br/>“The town hall definitely didn’t burn down. Nothing caught fire in the town that we can see or know of.”</blockquote>
