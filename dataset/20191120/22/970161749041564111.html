      <p>A newlywed couple are asking people to think twice before using the Royal Mail to send gifts this Christmas, after £100 was stolen from a wedding present while in the post.</p>
      <p>Adam Ford and his new wife Kayleigh were left devastated, after discovering that money sent from his mum in Shetland, Scotland, which it had taken her so long to save, had gone missing.</p>
      <p>Chargehand Adam first realised something was wrong when a recorded delivery, meant for his house, was delivered to his work at the Montgomerie Arms.</p>
      <p>After a closer look at the letter, which had been dumped on the bar with other post for his work, Adam realised that it had been ripped open and sealed over with a Royal Mail sticker.</p>
      <p>He also saw that the address had been changed.</p>

      <p>Devastated Adam and Kayleigh, who have reported the incident to Police Scotland, are now questioning the integrity of the postal service.</p>
      <p>Adam said: ‘When I told mum, she was just screaming and crying down the phone.</p>

      <p>‘One hundred pounds is a lot of money to her and it took a lot to be able to send that to us.</p>
      <p>‘It was her way of making up for the fact she couldn’t come down for the wedding, so it was a really big deal.</p>
      <p>‘It really makes you wonder how safe your mail is if this is happening when it’s supposed to have been signed for.’</p>
      <p>The couple got married at the Torrance Hotel on November 5, with around 160 people in attendance for their special day.</p>
      <p>Although Adam’s mum was unable to make the wedding, she sent the specially sourced £100 note to the couple to congratulate them on their big day.</p>

      <p>However, it never reached Adam and Kayleigh.</p>
      <p>A card arrived in the post, after which Adam called his mum to thank her.</p>
      <p>He only realised what had happened after his mum asked if he had got the money.</p>
      <p>Adam claims that the envelope had been ripped at the bottom corner and taped over,</p>
      <p>with the address clearly changed and other scribbles made on the envelope.</p>

      <p>Upon heading to the Royal Mail sorting office in East Kilbride to complain, Adam was speaking to a woman in the queue whose parcel had been delivered in a sealed bag because it had been burst open.</p>

      <p>Despite having paid for a recorded delivery, which offers compensation for lost or damaged goods, Adam has been told the pair are unlikely to see the money again.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Royal Mail said: ‘We are concerned to hear of this incident.</p>
      <p>‘Every item of mail is important to us. We are investigating the matter.’</p>
