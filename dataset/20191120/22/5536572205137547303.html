      <p>While it feels good to hear about people winning insane amounts of money betting as little as possible, it sucks knowing that it hasn’t happened to you yet.</p>
      <p>One Bettor recently struck it big when he walked into ARIA Race &amp; Sports Book in Las Vegas and put down a $100 bet on 8 teams during college football Saturday.</p>
      <p>He picked all the favorites and everybody who was favored came out on top.</p>
      <p>That bettor walked away with $17,220.00 when it was all said and done.</p>
