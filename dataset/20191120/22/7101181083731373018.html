      <p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/latest/people/cindy-crawford">Cindy Crawford</a> had several ladies to call out in her Woman Crush Wednesday post. </p>
      <p>The 53-year-old supermodel shared a photo on Instagram that features a slew of famous faces! "That's a lot of girl power in one photo. #WCW," she captioned the pic.</p>
      <p>While Crawford doesn't mention when or where this photograph was taken, she tagged most of the famous women who are posing with her. Among those stars are Jennifer Aniston, Gabrielle Union, Calista Flockhart, Allison Janney, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Fran Drescher, Rachel Hunter, Deidre Hall, Amber Valletta and former ET host Nancy O'Dell. </p>
      <p>The late Carrie Fisher and her daughter, Billie Lourd, are also in the pic. </p>
      <p>After doing some digging, it appears that this epic image was taken in 2003 at the St. Jude Runway for Life at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, California, where celebrities walked the catwalk for a good cause.</p>
