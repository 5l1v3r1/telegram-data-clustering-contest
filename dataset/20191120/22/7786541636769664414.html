      <p><b>CODY, Wyo.Â (AP)</b> - Kanye West has been denied a permit to build an amphitheater on his ranch in Wyoming.</p>
      <p>The Park County Planning and Zoning Commission made the decision Tuesday after the rapper changed his plans for the structure near Cody.</p>
      <p>West told county officials he now wants to include residential space.</p>
      <p>The Cody Enterprise reports that county officials also object to West already having done considerable work at the site. They told West's representatives to stop work immediately.</p>
      <p>Kane Morris with Point Architects in Cody apologized, saying West came forward as soon as he changed his mind and will stop the work.</p>
      <p>West bought the ranch this year and plans to move the headquarters of his shoe and clothing company, Adidas Yeezy, to Cody.</p>
