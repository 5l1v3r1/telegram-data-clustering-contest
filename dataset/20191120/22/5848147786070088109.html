      <h1>The Report and Official Secrets deliver for political thriller fans</h1>

      <p>Buckle up political thriller addicts. Atlantic-spanning biopics <i>The Report</i> and <i>Official Secrets</i> lay bare devastating assaults on the truth in the aftermath of 9/11.</p>
      <p>Adam Driver and Keira Knightley deliver some of their best work to date in the biting movies, which are well worth the price of a ticket.</p>
      <p>From <i>Girls</i> to running the world, Driver’s on fire right now.</p>
      <p>About to unleash the dark side as baddie Kylo Ren in grand finale <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>, he’s also igniting Oscars buzz alongside Scarlett Johansson in bittersweet Netflix triumph <i>Marriage Story</i>.</p>
      <p>While those two grab most headlines – the least said about zombie dud <i>The Dead Don’t Die</i> the better – his understated delivery in <i>The Report</i> is arguably better.</p>
      <p>Playing Daniel Jones, the real-life political staffer of former Intelligence Committee chair Senator Dianne Feinstein (an also brilliant Annette Bening), Driver gives an incredible turn that builds and builds to pack a mighty wallop.</p>
      <p>Doggedly determined, Jones worked tirelessly in the face of significant resistance to compile a 6700-word report on the CIA’s use, and cover-up of, brutal torture under the Bush administration.</p>
      <p>A Herculean mission consuming seven years, <i>The Report</i> exhilaratingly details his rapidly dwindling team’s exhaustive trawl through thousands of CIA emails, with no direct access to interviewees.</p>
      <p>While that might sound stuffy, it zings with righteous fury served ice cold.</p>

      <p>Methodically taking apart the case for torture, hammering home both the moral abdication and the total failure to uncover valuable intelligence, <i>The Report</i> grips from the get go.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t just Bush pushing back.</p>
      <p><i>Mad Men</i> star Jon Hamm plays Denis McDonough, President Obama’s chief of staff who is just as keen to silence criticism.</p>
      <p>The report has never been released in full, although a 500-page summary appeared in 2014.</p>
      <p>“It shows that the CIA’s action a decade ago are a stain on our values and on our history,” Feinstein said at the time.</p>
      <p>“The release of this 500-page summary cannot remove that stain.</p>
      <p>“But it can, and does, say to our people and the world that America is big enough to admit when it’s wrong and confident enough to learn from its mistakes.”</p>
      <p>If only that were true. Driver and Bening are an indomitable duo, and writer/director Scott Z Burns – who also penned Steven Soderbergh’s Panama Papers biopic <i>The Laundromat</i> – clearly nods at the parlous state of global politics today.</p>
      <p><i>Official Secrets</i> does likewise.</p>
      <p>Directed by Gavin Hood (<i>Eye in the Sky</i>) co-writing alongside husband and wife duo Gregory and Sara Bernstein, it’s grippingly adapted from tell-all book <i>The Spy Who Tried to Stop a War.</i></p>

      <p>Often wishy-washy, Knightley comes into her own as unassuming British intelligence officer Katharine Gunn.</p>
      <p>Far from a crusader, the real-life whistle-blower was thrown headlong into a terrible moral conundrum on receiving a US-directed email brazenly calling on UK intelligence officers to assist coercing smaller members of the UN to support invading Iraq.</p>
      <p>Gunn is devastated by this revelation, but her gut instinct to leak is tempered by tenuous visa situation of her refugee husband (Adam Bakri, <i>Omar, Slam</i>).</p>
      <p>As with Driver, Knightley has sensational back up here, including Ralph Fiennes as a human rights lawyer and Matt Smith, Matthew Goode and Rhys Ifans as investigative journalists.</p>
      <p>And without spoiling too much, if you think the cries of war criminal lobbed at Blair, Bush and Howard are lefty hysteria, the powerful courtroom finale is a timely reminder where that accusation comes from.</p>
      <p>Jaw-dropping doesn’t cover it.</p>
      <p>The perfect double bill in cinemas now, <i>The Report</i> and <i>Official Secrets </i>see the truth burn bright.</p>
