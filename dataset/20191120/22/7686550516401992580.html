      <p>Two new celebrities are set to join the campmates in the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle - and they're soap legends.</p>
      <p>The end of Wednesday night's episode teased that two new additions will join the camp - and it's been revealed that the newbies include Coronation Street star Andrew Whyment and actor Cliff Parisi were teased as the late entries.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who is known for playing lovable Kirky in Coronation Street, and Cliff, known for playing Minty in Eastenders, are now well on their way to joining the others and sampling the mysteries of the jungle.</p>
      <p>Corrie fans were left gutted when Andrew didn't appear in the original line-up as it was rumoured he would be taking part for so long.</p>
      <p>But it looks as though Kirk lovers are in for a treat this week.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, it's been reported that Cliff initially turned down the job until he was shown a huge tax bill by his accountant.</p>
      <p>The information displayed was said to have changed his mind.</p>
      <p>Cliff <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebs-newbies-andrew-whyment-20919907">told The Mirror</a>: “What made me sign up?</p>
      <p>"The taxman. I have got a bill I need to pay.</p>
      <p>"Like everyone at this time of year, you go, ‘Oh no. Again...' You would think I earn a lot of money but I don’t.</p>
      <p>"I work for the BBC, so it ain’t that big.</p>
      <p>“I had a meeting about this earlier on in the year, and I thought about it long and hard and said no.</p>
      <p>"And then as I got an estimate for my tax, I phoned them up and said, is it too late to say yes?</p>
      <p>“So here I am. But it could be an amazing experience and I hope it is."</p>
