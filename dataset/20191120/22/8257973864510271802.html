      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Sailors from four countries met in the waters off Guam Wednesday to start the second iteration of the U.S.-led Pacific Vanguard training exercise, meant to practice tactical cooperation at sea.</p>
      <p>According to figures released by the Navy, about 1,500 soldiers total -- coming from Australia, Canada and South Korea, as well as the United States -- will participate in the exercise, which comes six months after the first iteration in May.</p>
      <p>Notably absent is Japan, which <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/05/23/South-Korea-Japan-take-part-in-US-led-Pacific-naval-exercise/4731558619397/">participated in the May exercise</a>, officials said, as a condition of mediation issued by the United States.</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark-Esper/?tps=1">Mark Esper</a> <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/20/Mark-Espers-remarks-inviting-crisis-to-US-Korea-alliance-analyst-says/8731574253646/">has been in Asia since last week</a>, in part to help mend relations between South Korea and Japan, which have grown tense in recent months.</p>
      <p>Navy officials said the purpose of the exercise is to practice tactical cooperation at sea and work on a range of skill sets including live-fire exercises, defensive counter-air operations, anti-submarine warfare and replenishment at sea.</p>
      <p>"Building on the success of the previous exercise, Pacific Vanguard continues to serve as an opportunity for like-minded maritime nations to come together based on their shared values and common interests," <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Vice_Adm/?tps=1">Vice Adm</a>. Bill Merz, commander of U.S. 7th Fleet, said in a Navy press release. "Our forces will use the next few days to exercise and improve our multilateral ability to adapt to ever changing regional challenges."</p>
      <p>Officials haven't said how long they expect this iteration of the Pacific Vanguard to last, but the <a href="https://www.naval-technology.com/news/us-and-allied-naval-forces-conclude-exercise-pacific-vanguard/">May exercise lasted a week</a>.</p>
