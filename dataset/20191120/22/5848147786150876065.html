      <h1>The Queen calls for family unity amid new Prince Andrew revelations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:11:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/kate-halfpenny/" target="_blank">Kate Halfpenny</a></address>
      <p>The Queen celebrated <a href="https://www.oprahmag.com/entertainment/tv-movies/a29726317/queen-elizabeth-ii-husband-prince-philip-marriage/">72 years of marriage</a> to Prince Philip on Wednesday, but any party was likely to have been muted.</p>
      <p>Her heir Charles is in New Zealand, her <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/14/meghan-harry-christmas/">grandson Harry</a> is soon leaving the country, and her son Andrew is in all sorts.</p>
      <p>It is not known if the royals watched the Duke of York’s <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-testify-epstein/">excruciating BBC interview</a> about his relationship with dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, but what is clear is the family is rallying around Andrew.</p>
      <p>The united front is the specific wish of the Queen, according to reports, despite claims the interview has caused Windsor ructions.</p>
      <p>“It’s the Queen’s modus operandi to stick together in times of trouble,” the monarch’s biographer Sarah Gristwood told <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein?utm_source=nl&amp;utm_brand=vf&amp;utm_mailing=VF_CH_111919&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;bxid=5c7487253f92a46844972c12&amp;cndid=51824274&amp;hasha=fda64e009a267ec196ebe9e0a86761ea&amp;hashb=95a82e89ef4b57ec318834755a1f53a1cd903b6f&amp;hashc=96c80ef74a51dc7d0892c3a907014c74df137eb486a65999e0cbbf8a6ebc50c9&amp;esrc=bounceX&amp;utm_campaign=VF_CH_111919&amp;utm_term=VYF_Cocktail_Hour"><i>Vanity Fair</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“She won’t have any breaking of the ranks.</p>
      <p>“That said, this must be stretching it, because what he’s done is the least welcome thing anyone could do to their mother, especially at the age of 93.”</p>
      <p>Andrew’s ex-wife Sarah Ferguson fulsomely supported the “giant of a principled man” on Instagram, and his princess daughters Beatrice and Eugenie are said to be standing behind their father.</p>
      <p>There are questions about how Andrew’s Epstein links will affect Beatrice’s wedding next year, and Eugenie is said privately to be “very worried” the reputation of her anti-slavery charity could be damaged.</p>

      <p>The British media has called for Andrew to withdraw from official duties as the FBI investigation into Epstein’s activities continues.</p>
      <p>“T<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/prince-andrew-should-withdraw-royal-duties-public-doesnt-want/">he public doesn’t want to fund the friend of a pedophile</a>,” said <i>The Telegraph.</i></p>
      <p>It appears he plans to do that.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.royal.uk/future-engagements?text=&amp;mrf=2919&amp;date%5Bmin%5D%5Bdate%5D=20%2F11%2F2019&amp;date%5Bmax%5D%5Bdate%5D=20%2F01%2F2020&amp;id=">Buckingham Palace diary</a> shows no future engagements for the duke, who lost the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-loses-spin-doctor/">major sponsor for his mentoring scheme</a> after the BBC interview.</p>
      <p>Veteran <i>Daily Mail</i> royals reporter Andrew Kay says the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/19/prince-andrew-never-partied/">Duke of York’s situation</a> is “far worse” than past royal scandals because it involves criminal behaviour.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never seen any royal shoot themselves in the foot as spectacularly as Andrew,” Kay said.</p>

      <p>The family is still out on the hustings – Charles and Camilla meeting NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sussexroyal/?hl=en">Harry presenting awards</a> – but has said nothing about calls for one of its senior members to <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/09/29/epstein-pro-bersfocus-on-prince-andrew/">face FBI questioning</a>.</p>
      <p>The Queen would have signed off on Andrew doing the 49-minute <i>Newsnight</i> sitdown, and mother and son were reportedly together at Balmoral when news broke of <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/20/guards-slept-surfed-net-when-jeffrey-epstein-died/">Epstein’s suicide</a> in a New York prison in August.</p>
      <p>He spoke with the Queen then, denying allegations he had sex three ties with then 17-year-old <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/10/prince-andrew-epstein-jail/">Virginia Roberts, now Giuffre</a>, in 2001.</p>
      <p>“As his mother, she believed him, and she still does,” said a source close to the Queen.</p>
      <p>In the face of the Andrew controversy, the Windsors are displaying their “herd instinct”, said Kay: “When their credibility is called into question, their first strategy is to stand by the family, and their natural instinct is to believe each other.”</p>
      <p>Despite or because of his dreadful BBC showing, Andrew “hasn’t drawn a line” under rumours he may do another interview.</p>
      <p>“He wants the chance to put right the things he didn’t say,” a source said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, a source who was with the duke in New York when he was accused of sleeping with Ms Giuffre in April 2001 has told the <i>Telegraph</i> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/19/duke-had-hours-unaccompanied-new-york-visit-virginia-roberts/">there were possible gaps in his itinerary</a>.</p>
      <p>Andrew told the BBC his busy schedule would have meant a sexual encounter with Ms Giuffre could not have happened, but the source said he had “hours unaccompanied”.</p>
      <p>He flew to New York on April 9, with the court circular listing no official engagements for that day.</p>
      <p>On the same day, Epstein’s private jet carrying a party including Ms Giuffre landed at a small airport 30 minutes’ drive from Epstein’s Manhattan home.</p>
      <p>That information came from flight logs contained in US court documents made public this year.</p>

      <p>After a three-day tour that ended in Boston, Andrew’s entourage flew to London while the duke headed back to New York with his security detail, according to the <i>Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>The newspaper’s source could not confirm the duke’s whereabouts for the full three days.</p>
      <p>“I’ve no idea,” said the source when asked if the duke might have visited Epstein.</p>
      <p>The source said while it was impossible to account for the Duke’s activities in New York, it was “inconceivable” he was involved in sexual relations with Ms Giuffre.</p>
