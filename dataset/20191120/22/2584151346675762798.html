      <h1>NATO to Macron: We’ll get back to you</h1>
      <h2>Germany suggests a panel of experts should examine the alliance following French president’s ‘brain death’ remark.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:19:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:19</time> by <a rel="author">David M. Herszenhorn</a></address>
      <p>NATO will think for a bit about how to prove it's not braindead.</p>
      <p>At a meeting Wednesday of NATO foreign ministers, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that allies were receptive to a proposal put forward by Germany to form an expert group, led by Stoltenberg, that would review aspects of the alliance's operations — a move widely seen as a response to complaints by French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
      <p>Macron, in a recent interview with the Economist, lashed out over the unilateral military activity by two allies, the United States and Turkey, in northern Syria. He said, "What we are experiencing now is the brain death of NATO." In the same interview, Macron also called into question the durability of Article 5, the alliance's collective defense doctrine.</p>
      <p>Those remarks, particularly the doubts expressed about Article 5, left many allies enraged, though privately some conceded that <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macrons-transatlantic-turbulence/">Macron had a fair point</a> about the lack of coordination, particularly by the United States.</p>
      <p>An array of German officials had pushed back on Macron, including <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/annegret-kramp-karrenbauer-emmanuel-macron-german-defense-minister-hits-back-nato-criticism/">Defense Minister</a> Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer. European Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, who is a former German defense minister, also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/von-der-leyen-praises-nato-in-contrast-to-macron/">spoke out in support</a> of NATO, as did the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-ambassador-to-nato-questions-emmanuel-macron-rationality-kay-bailey-hutchison/">U.S. Ambassador to NATO</a> Kay Bailey Hutchison.</p>
      <p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas arrived at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday with a plan to ease the tensions by appointing the expert group, though he was careful to reiterate Germany's position that NATO is indispensable or European security. Still, he conceded in a statement ahead of the ministerial: “NATO has undergone difficult stress tests recently.”</p>
      <p>At a news conference after Wednesday's meetings, Stoltenberg said the proposal was well-received by allies and would be given further consideration ahead of a leaders' summit in London early next month.</p>
      <p>"First of all, allies expressed very strong support to NATO and to the importance of transatlantic unity," Stoltenberg said. "The proposal from Minister Heiko Maas received support from many allies and, I think, it has value and we will now look into it as we prepare for the upcoming leaders' meeting and then we will decide what to do."</p>
      <p>Stoltenberg, who had spent much of the last two years safeguarding the alliance amid fierce criticism by U.S. President Donald Trump over insufficient military spending by European allies, made a predictably strong defense of the alliance against Macron's assertions, though he did not address Macron personally other than to say he planned to visit Paris next week.</p>
      <p>"We are actually the only platform where North America and Europe sits together, decides together and do things together" on important security issues, he said.</p>
      <p>Still, Stoltenberg said he was very open to the Maas proposal. "Again, I think it has value to look into how we can further strengthen NATO and the transatlantic bond. We need to look into this as we prepare for the upcoming leaders' meeting and then we will see what will be the final conclusions," he said at the news conference.</p>
      <p>NATO's foreign affairs ministerial played out as the latest chapter of Trump's impeachment process unfolded in Washington, including dramatic testimony by the U.S. ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland.</p>
      <p>Stoltenberg, however, declined to be drawn into the impeachment mess, and ducked a question about his views on Trump's withholding of military aid to Ukraine, a NATO partner country.</p>
      <p>"If I started to respond to that, I will be part of domestic political debate and that is not something I will do," Stoltenberg said, "because that will only divert attention from what is my main responsibility and that is to make sure that allies stand united as we continue to provide political and practical support to Ukraine."</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who attended the ministerial, refused to answer a question about Sondland's testimony, in which the ambassador stated that Pompeo directed Sondland to coordinate Ukraine policy with Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t see a single thing today," Pompeo snapped in response. "I was working. It sounds like you might not have been. I was in meetings all day and haven’t had a chance to see any of that testimony."</p>
      <p>On the Maas proposal, Pompeo was non-committal, but he said in principle he supported the idea of periodic institutional introspection.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know if this is precisely the right moment or if this is the right format," he said. "We’ll all think about that, but it is eminently reasonable to continue to make sure that alliances that are put together — this critical alliance that is NATO — that it’s right, that it’s structured properly, that burden-sharing is aligned in the right way."</p>
      <p>He noted that NATO was facing new challenges no one envisioned when the alliance was created. "When it was created, counterterrorism wasn’t a part of what it did," Pompeo said. "Today we have the threat from the Chinese Communist Party — that wasn’t something that NATO was thinking about 70 years ago at its founding."</p>
