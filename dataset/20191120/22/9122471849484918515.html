      <h1>Report: Decision On Myles Garrett’s Appeal Could Come Today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:07:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Myles Garrett was in New York earlier today to appeal his indefinite suspension from the NFL. His punishment from the league quickly came after he struck Mason Rudolph over the head with his own helmet.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Dianna Russini reported today that Garrett would learn his fate very soon. It turns out that he actually might find out in the coming hours.</p>
      <p>Mary Kay Cabot of cleveland.com is reporting that a decision on Garrett’s appeal could come as early as today.</p>
      <p>Garrett’s appeal process is being handled by James Thrash, who was a former wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins.</p>

      <p>Regardless of what the NFL decides to do with his suspension, it’s highly unlikely the Cleveland Browns will have Garrett for the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>The real question is whether or not he’s able to avoid a suspension that lingers into next season as well.</p>
      <p>Last week, the NFL ruled that Garrett would be suspended for the rest of the season and playoffs. He would then need the league to reinstate him for the following season.</p>
      <p>Garrett has stated multiple times that he regrets what he did last Thursday against the Steelers. We’ll find out if he made a strong enough case for his punishment to get reduced.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more updates on this situation.</p>
