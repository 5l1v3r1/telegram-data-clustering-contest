      <p>A court heard Robert Speed, 36, drove his brother-in-law Ryan Brown, 22, and two others to return a mobile to two Rashid brothers when a row broke out in Kirkcaldy.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Ronnie Hay told the town’s sheriff court: “A loud bang was heard and the complainer said ‘I’ve been shot’.”</p>
      <p>Ms Rashid collapsed and was rushed to the nearby Victoria Hospital.</p>
      <p>A pellet found near the base of the neck was too dangerous to remove.</p>
      <p>The court was told Speed clubbed Ms Rashid before returning to his Citroen Berlingo van for the gun, which he said he didn’t know was loaded.</p>
      <p>One of the Rashids was also seen with a baseball bat near the Novar Bar.</p>
      <p>Slamming the Sunday afternoon horror, Sheriff Jamie Gilchrist QC said: “This was gangsterism played out in public in broad daylight.”</p>
      <p>Perth prisoner Speed admitted assault to severe injury and danger of life on August 4. He was jailed for three years and four months on Tuesday.</p>
