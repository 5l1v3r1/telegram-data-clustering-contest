      <p>Sonos, which announced the purchase in releasing earnings for its fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, spent <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/sonos-snips-acquisition-q4-2019-earnings-1203410771/">$37.5 million in cash</a> on the Paris- and Tokyo-based firm, reports <i>Variety</i>.<br/><br/>Prior to its acquisition, Snips was working on a platform to launch dedicated voice assistants on smart speakers and other devices, the report said. <br/><br/>Unlike products marketed by most major manufacturers, including Amazon and Google, Snips' technology does not rely on cloud processing as a bulk of voice recognition and natural language computations are performed on a host device. The solution could keep sensitive data out of the cloud in a fashion similar to Apple's Siri. <br/><br/>Sonos CEO Patrick Spence said Snips tech will be used for music-related tasks, though he was purposely vague on what, exactly, Sonos plans to accomplish with an on-board voice assistant. He did say, however, that his company does not intend on competing with Amazon's Alexa or Google Assistant, both of which are accessible with certain Sonos speakers.<br/><br/>"We are not building an ask-anything assistant," Spence said. <br/><br/>The executive went on to suggest privacy was a major element of the upcoming integration, the report said. <br/><br/>"It's an option we want to provide customers," Spence said. "Freedom of choice has been a big part of our message."<br/><br/>Beyond the Snips acquisition, Sonos released early data on its partnership with Ikea, which <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/04/08/sonos-ikea-airplay-2-compatible-symfonisk-speakers-will-cost-as-little-as-99">in April spawned</a> two <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1989299-10777937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sonos.com%2Fen-us%2Fsymfonisk-by-sonos-and-ikea">Symfonisk</a> smart speakers boasting Ikea styling and Sonos internals. Ikea sold 30,000 of the AirPlay 2-enabled devices on launch day, Sonos said without elaborating on total numbers.</p>
