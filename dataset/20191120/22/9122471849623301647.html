      <h1>Report: Source ‘Close To’ Urban Meyer Thinks He’s Done Coaching</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T22:01:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 22:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Urban Meyer has been rumored to be heading back into coaching since the day he announced he was stepping down at Ohio State. After spending this year working in television, many think Meyer will be back on the sideline in 2020.</p>
      <p>USC is the program Meyer has been linked to the most this season. The Trojans are 7-4, but Clay Helton remains on the hot seat, and Meyer has been rumored to be the top potential target.</p>
      <p>However, a new report indicates there are some who think Meyer is serious about being “done” with coaching, even after claiming he was finished twice in the past.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/as-james-franklin-enters-his-prime-penn-state-hopes-to-hold-off-usc-other-potential-suitors/">CBS Sports’ Dennis Dodd</a>, at least one prominent person in college football claims Meyer does not want to return.</p>
      <blockquote>One high-ranking college football source close to the coach told CBS Sports they firmly believe that Meyer is done. Maybe. Meyer was done twice at Florida before coming back to Ohio State.</blockquote>
      <p>Here at The Spun, we’ve heard the same whispers as everybody else linking Meyer to USC. New USC AD Mike Bohn has ties to Meyer, but Yahoo’s Pete Thamel doesn’t think they are strong enough to warrant him hiring the three-time national champion.</p>
      <p>In a recent report, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/10-takeaways-in-the-wake-of-another-humiliating-loss-whats-next-at-usc-062436192.html">Thamel wrote</a> that if USC really wanted to hire Meyer, its president Carol Folt would have tabbed a different person as AD.</p>
      <blockquote>Bohn and Meyer have some surface ties, as Meyer’s son plays baseball at Cincinnati and provides the strongest link. But if USC leaders wanted someone with deep ties to Meyer, they passed on multiple candidates. Those with knowledge of the search say it’s a clear sign Folt wants a different direction.<br/><br/>“If they wanted to go and get Urban Meyer, they’d need to hire someone he has a strong relationship with,” said an industry source. “He needs to believe in his AD. He’s been very close with all the athletic directors he’s worked with.”</blockquote>
      <p>If we had to wager money on it, Meyer is likely not done coaching. We think he’ll eventually be back on the sideline somewhere soon.</p>
