      <p>Ryan-Mark Parsons has shut down the racism claims made against Lord Sugar branding them ‘absolutely ridiculous’ and that the accusations are a ‘complete fabrication’.</p>
      <p>It was recently reported that Lord Sugar made a dig at Jemelin Artigas’ native country as she was fired from the boardroom on last week’s episode.</p>
      <p>It was claimed <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361506/the-apprentice-lorg-sugar-race-row/">by The Sun</a> that Lord Sugar told her: ‘No wonder your country is in a state – it’s because it’s full of people like you.’</p>
      <p>However Ryan-Mark, who was the latest candidate to be fired from the BBC show, has put the record straight and said the candidates who have made the claims are ‘clutching at straws’.</p>
      <p><b>He told Metro.co.uk: </b>‘When I see accusations that people are being fired because of how they look, it’s completely ridiculous Lord Sugar fired people based on performance alone.</p>

      <p>‘The candidates that are blaming being fired on other factors are fooling themselves and trying to make up for a pretty shambolic performance and using excuses for why lord sugar made them leave.</p>

      <p>‘I think in terms of the candidates of accusing lord sugar of being racist, that is a complete fabrication, he’s not racist there was no indication throughout the process that he was using race as a factor.</p>
      <p>‘They are clutching at straws and trying to stay relevant, its ridiculous and they need to drop it.’</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark, who was the youngest candidate on the show, continued to explain how despite this week’s task being a ‘disastrous’ one he felt Lord Sugar’s decision to fire him was wrong.</p>

      <p>‘Lord Sugar did not make the right decision, I shouldn’t have been fired,’ he explained.</p>
      <p>‘If you look at Thomas, the only reason he was saved was because he decided to come back to the boardroom, I love Thomas but he has lost seven out of eight tasks and it was a disaster on his side.</p>
      <p>‘Marianne is a naïve person on task, who runs around in her own universe.</p>
      <p>‘And on task, she would be all over the place, she would be erratic and when it came to the boardroom she would attack you and be very condescending and patronising. She would really go for you.’</p>

      <p>The womenswear consultant exclaimed that ‘you have to fight for your place in the boardroom’ and that everyone is out for themselves.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘In the boardroom, I needed to defend myself that’s just the way it works.</p>
      <p>‘The issue I had with some candidates, like Marianne is that she would be fine with you on task and then she would switch very dramatically. Marianne has a split personality.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think Lord Sugar could work with her, it’s hard to guess what Lord Sugar is thinking at that moment in the boardroom.’</p>
