      <p>Two days before the long-awaited release of their eighth studio album, <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/everyday-life/"><i>Everyday Life</i></a><i>,</i> <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/coldplay/">Coldplay</a> has just put out two brand new songs.</p>
      <p>The tracks are called “Daddy” and “Champion of the World”<i>, </i>and serve as the album’s fourth and fifth singles overall. They were released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Daddy” dropped alongside a visually stunning music video directed by Åsa Lucander and produced by Aardman Animations (“Wallce &amp; Gromit”). The enticing feature also included puppetry from practical effects studio, Brunskill &amp; Grimes.</p>
      <p>While “Champion of the World” came with only a lyric video, it was written by Coldplay’s <a href="https://globalnews.ca/tag/chris-martin/">Chris Martin</a> as a tribute to the late-Frightened Rabbit frontman, Scott Hutchison.</p>

      <p>Martin, 42, utilized Colplay’s <a href="https://twitter.com/coldplay/status/1197204629924261894">official Twitter account</a> to write about Hutchison’s contibutions.</p>
      <p>“Scott had a song called ‘Los Angeles Be Kind’, which I love,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“When I first heard it, I thought it was going to go one way; but it went another. Anyway <i>Champion of the World</i> is the song that came from following the other path, and that’s why Scott is a co-writer on this song.”</p>

      <p>Martin also dedicated it to the fallen musician as a birthday present.</p>
      <p>“Today is also his birthday,” he wrote. “So happy birthday, Scott, and thank you for your beautiful music, wherever you are.”</p>
