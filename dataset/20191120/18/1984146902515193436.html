      <h1>The alarming poverty stats that really should be an issue at the 2019 general election</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle Central has been named among the 20 UK constituencies with the highest rates of child poverty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker</a></address>
      <p>Some people are billing this as “the Brexit election”.</p>
      <p>It suggests the top issue that will decide how people vote is <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit.</a> But all the political parties are actually keen to bring other issues into the debate.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservative</a> leader Boris Johnson presents Brexit not as an end in itself but as the key to carrying out his domestic agenda, which includes increasing funding for schools, hospitals and police.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader Jeremy Corbyn says that this election is a “once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country”.</p>
      <p>One of the issues that all the major parties could focus on is poverty.</p>
      <p>Research by Loughborough University for the End Child Poverty campaign found that parts of the North East have the highest levels of child poverty in the country.</p>
      <p>Academics identified the 20 UK constituencies with the highest rates of child poverty.</p>
      <p>They include <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle Central</a>, where 13,270 children or 48% of the total are in poverty.</p>
      <p>A particular concern is the number of people who find themselves in poverty even though they work.</p>
      <p>Research by the House of Commons found 15% of working age adults in the North East who live in households where at least one adult works is in poverty. That’s nearly one in six people.</p>
      <p>Poverty is defined as a household income which is lower than 60% of the median household income, after housing costs.</p>
      <p>It’s sometimes said that work used to be a route out of poverty, but that this is no longer the case. However, it’s worth nothing that the chances of being in poverty are still much higher for households where nobody works. The statistics show 55% of working age adults in this situation are in poverty.</p>
      <p>One vivid example of the impact of extreme poverty is the level of homelessness and rough sleeping in the city.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, official figures revealed that 120 homeless people died in the North East over a five year period.</p>
      <p>The figures mainly include people sleeping rough at or around the time of death, but also include those using emergency accommodation such as homeless shelters and direct access hostels.</p>
      <p>They included an estimated 20 deaths in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a> between 2013 and 2017, with a death rate of 1.9 per 100,000, as well as an estimated nine deaths in Durham between 2013 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Officials at the Office for National Statistics say the method used provides a robust but conservative estimate, so the real figures could be higher still.</p>

      <p>Nationwide, an estimated 726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, the highest year-to-year increase since records began, the Office for National Statistics has said.</p>
      <p>Most of the deaths in 2018 were men, 88% of the total, the government body revealed.</p>
      <p>Birmingham had the highest number of deaths of any local authority in the country, but it also has the largest population.</p>
      <p>Once population size is taken into account, the city had a lower death rate than many other places including Newcastle, Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>And it also emerged earlier this year that the homelessness, poverty and the impact of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a>, the new benefits system, is making people ill.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> trusts, rising demand for healthcare is linked to a shortage of housing, employment and the changes to the benefit system.</p>
      <p>The point was  made by Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, the body that represents NHS trusts, when she spoke to MPs at Westminster.</p>
      <p>She said: “The causes of that demand include things such as housing, employment and the changes to benefits and universal credit, which came out as one of the highest issues.</p>
      <p>“We are really looking at the wider socioeconomic impact on raw demand for services in trusts. I think that is really important.”</p>
      <p> A report published by NHS Providers warned: “92% of trusts tell us that changes to universal credit and benefits are increasing demand for services, as are loneliness, homelessness and wider deprivation.</p>
      <p>“Cuts to services funded by local authorities also mean that preventative approaches and early intervention services are less available.”</p>
      <p>There are plenty of issues that could come up in this election. And it’s fair to say that they are already being discussed to some extent. But fighting poverty could certainly be more in the spotlight than it has been so far.</p>
