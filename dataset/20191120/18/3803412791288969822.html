      <p><a href="https://www.imore.com/ipados-everything-you-need-know">iPadOS 13.3</a> is on its way with new features that require third-party developer input. As such, the company is releasing developer betas so that software engineers can get a head start on making great software for you.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Apple occasionally offers updates to <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-13-faq">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.imore.com/watchos-6-faq">watchOS</a>, <a href="https://www.imore.com/tvos-13-faq">tvOS</a>, and <a href="https://www.imore.com/macOS-catalina-faq">macOS</a> as closed developer previews or <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">public betas</a> for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and Mac (sadly, no public beta for the Apple Watch). While the betas contain new features, they also contain pre-release bugs that can prevent the normal use of your iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or Mac, and are not intended for everyday use on a primary device. That's why we strongly recommend staying away from developer previews unless you need them for software development, and using the public betas with caution. If you depend on your devices, wait for the final release.</i>

      <h3>How to make an archived backup of your iPad</h3>
      <p>Before you begin, make sure you back up your iPad. While the beta process is fairly straightforward, any time you make any significant change to your device you risk problems. And with your personal data, it's always — always! — better to be safe than sorry. Even if you back up every night, you'll want to make sure it's absolutely up-to-date.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Plug <b>iPad</b> into your Mac or Windows PC.</li>
        <li>Launch <b>iTunes</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the or <b>iPad</b> icon in the menu bar when it appears.</li>
        <li>Make sure backup is set to <b>This Computer</b>. (And enable <b>Encrypted backup</b> — it's worth it!)</li>
        <li>Click on <b>Back Up Now</b>. (Click on <b>Encrypt Backup</b> and add a password — you want the security.)</li>
        <li><b>Back up Apps</b>, if asked.</li>
        <li>Press <b>Command,</b> to open Preferences. (Or go to <b>iTunes</b> in the menu bar and click on <b>Preferences</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the <b>Devices</b> tab.</li>
        <li>Control-click on your <b>Backup</b> and choose <b>Archive</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Archiving will prevent your current backup from being overwritten by an iPadOS backup in the future, should you want to revert for any reason.</p>
      <h3>How to install the iPadOS beta using iTunes</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">developer.apple.com</a> on your Mac.</li>
        <li>Click on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/discover/">"Discover"</a> tab.</li>
        <li>Click one of the <b>operating system buttons</b> in the bar near the top of the screen.</li>

        <li>Click on the <b>iPadOS restore image</b> that matches the device onto which you plan to install it.</li>
        <li>Click <b>Applications</b> at the top of the list of beta software.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>How to install the iPadOS beta using a profile</h3>
      <p>Before you do anything else, make sure you have a developer account with Apple — without a paid account, you won't be able to download any non-Xcode betas.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Apple's configuration profile, you can download iPadOS betas directly on your iPad, no Mac required! (You can still <a href="https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&amp;path=%2Fdownload%2F&amp;rv=1">install the iPadOS beta on your iPad by connecting your device to iTunes</a>, but you'll need to be running the Xcode beta first. The method listed below is generally a lot faster, with fewer wires.)</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">developer.apple.com</a> on your iPad.</li>
        <li>Tap on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/discover/">"Discover"</a> tab.</li>
        <li>Tap on of the <b>operating system buttons</b> in the bar near the top of the screen.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Download</b>.</li>
        <li>Log in with your developer account's username and password.</li>
        <li>Go to the iPadOS 13 beta section and tap the <b>download</b>. This will start the process of downloading the iPadOS beta software profile on your iPad.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Close.</b></li>
        <li>Open <b>Settings</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Profile Downloaded</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Install</b>. You may need to enter your <b>Passcode</b>.</li>
        <li>Agree to the Consent form and press <b>Install</b> once in the upper right corner, and once at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Press <b>Restart</b> to apply the changes to your iPad.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To install the iPadOS beta, you'll need to visit Software Update on your iPad once you have the profile loaded.</p>

      </figure>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch <b>Settings</b> from your Home screen, tap on <b>General</b>, then tap on <b>Software Update</b>.</li>
        <li>Once the update appears, tap on <b>Download and Install</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter your <b>Passcode</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Agree</b> to the Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Agree</b> again to confirm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your iPad will reboot to install iPadOS 13. There will be a couple of progress bars going across the screen. Sit tight, and let everything finish.</p>
      <h3>How to get started with iPadOS beta</h3>
      <p>Once your iPad reboots, it'll be running iPadOS the latest beta. There's a brief bit of setup you'll need to go through, however, as the system will have changed enough that it'll need your login to complete the update.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tap <b>Continue</b>.</li>
        <li>Enter your Apple ID <b>password</b>. iCloud settings will update, so give it a minute.</li>
        <li>Tap <b>Get Started</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Once that's done, you'll be on the Home screen and ready to rock the latest iPadOS beta.</p>
