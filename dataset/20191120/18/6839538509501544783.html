      <p>The British government has demanded answers after a former consulate employee in Hong Kong claimed Chinese police tortured him for information about the ongoing anti-government protests.</p>
      <p>Simon Cheng said in an online statement and media interviews that he was hooded, beaten, deprived of sleep and chained to an X-shaped frame by plainclothes and uniformed agents as they sought information on activists involved in the protests and the role they believed Britain played in the demonstrations.</p>

      <p>British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to demand Beijing investigate.</p>
      <p>“I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon in violation of China’s international obligations,” Mr Raab said.</p>
      <p>“I have made clear we expect the Chinese authorities to investigate and hold those responsible to account.”</p>

      <p>Chinese police in August announced Cheng’s release after 15 days of administrative detention but gave no details of the reasons behind his detention.</p>
      <p>China’s foreign ministry responded angrily to the allegations and the summoning of the ambassador.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Liu Xiaoming will “by no means accept the so-called concerns or complaints raised by the British side”, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.</p>
      <p>“The Chinese ambassador to the UK will lodge the complaints with the UK to express our strong opposition and indignation to the U.K.’s wrong words and deeds on Hong Kong in these days,” Mr Geng said.</p>

      <p>Mr Geng did not address Mr Cheng’s allegations directly, but cited a statement by Shenzhen police from August saying his lawful rights had been protected and that he had “admitted his offence completely,” an apparent reference to a confession of soliciting prostitution that Mr Cheng says was coerced.</p>
      <p>Mr Cheng has strongly denied the charge.</p>
      <p>Police in Shenzhen did not immediately respond to faxed questions about Mr Cheng’s allegations.</p>
      <p>Mr Cheng worked for the consulate as a trade and investment officer with a focus on attracting Chinese investment in Scotland.</p>

      <p>That required him to travel frequently to mainland China and he was detained at the border with Hong Kong after returning from a one-day business trip.</p>
      <p>China says it doesn’t allow suspects to be tortured or make false confessions, although both practices are believed to be common.</p>

      <p>In his account on Facebook, Mr Cheng wrote that he had been asked about the supposed British role in the protests, his own involvement in them and mainland Chinese who joined in demonstrations.</p>
      <p>China has long accused “anti-China foreign forces” of fomenting the protests, which have grown increasingly violent, without providing direct evidence.</p>
