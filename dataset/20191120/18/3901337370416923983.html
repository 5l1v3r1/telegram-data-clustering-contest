      <p>There are up to 11 players at Mzansi’s big three clubs who are currently being linked with a move away, but could a transfer materialize in January?</p>
      <p>With just over one month to go before clubs in the Premier Soccer League reassess and reshuffle their squads, there have already been several players who have been linked with new clubs, while others could possibly sign pre-contracts elsewhere. </p>
      <p>However, which players at the big three could be heading out the exit door come January next year, in either a permanent transfer or loan move?</p>
      <p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Kaizer Chiefs:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lorenzo Gordinho, Kabelo Mahlasela, Siphelele Ntshangase and James Kotei have in the past months been linked with a possible loan or transfer out of Naturena in order to get in the needed game-time.</p>
      <p>Although it remains to be seen whether their current situations at the club could change before then.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mamelodi Sundowns:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aubrey Ngoma and Lucky Mohomi have not featured in any domestic fixture for Sundowns so far this season, after the duo was heavily linked with a move away in the previous July/August transfer window.</p>
      <p>Indications are that the Brazilians could be looking to consider allowing both Mohomi and Ngoma to find game-time elsewhere, should the duo not be in Head Coach Pitso Mosimane’s plans for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Reyaad Pieterse has also been linked with a move to Chiefs, although it remains to be seen whether Sundowns would want to risk losing the player to their rivals. </p>
      <p>Soumahoro Bangaly has also been left out in the cold, while there have been questions surrounding Emiliano Tade’s future with Sundowns requiring a foreign quote spot to register Ricardo Nascimento in January. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Orlando Pirates:</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Siya sources, Bongani Sam and Tebogo Tlolane have both been linked with a loan move elsewhere and it remains to be seen whether a move away from the Bucs will materialize in the January transfer window.</p>
