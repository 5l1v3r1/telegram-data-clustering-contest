      <h1>Injury Update For Chicago Bears QB Mitchell Trubisky</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:00:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>A season of struggles continued for Chicago Bears quarterback Mitch Trubisky on Sunday as the third-year pro was pulled late in a loss to the Los Angeles Rams with what is being labeled a hip pointer.</p>
      <p>Trubisky had played poorly up until that point in the game, continuing what has been a disappointing year for him. As of now, there’s no guarantee he’ll be on the field this Sunday against the New York Giants.</p>
      <p>According to Bears head coach Matt Nagy, Trubisky is day-to-day. He may practice today, though that has yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>If Trubisky can’t play Sunday, backup Chase Daniel will take over the reins of the offense.</p>

      <p>Daniel already filled in for an injured Trubisky for one start this season and a pair of starts last year. Ironically, one of those 2018 games was also against the Giants, which the Bears lost.</p>
      <p>For the season, Trubisky has thrown for 1,580 yards, nine touchdowns and four interceptions. The Bears are 4-6 and likely have to win out in order to have a chance at a Wild Card berth.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned this week for more updates on Trubisky’s health.</p>
