      <h1>An 'Amazon Quebec' to better serve 'nationalists?': Quebec's premier likes the idea</h1>

      <p>QUEBEC -- Quebec Premier Francois Legault and Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon believe the creation of an "Amazon Quebec" would better serve "nationalist" clients.</p>
      <p>The two men raised the notion of creating a Quebec version of the online sales giant Wednesday morning, just hours ahead of a meeting with officials from Amazon Canada.</p>
      <p>The idea was first floated in 2017 by Quebec entrepreneur Alexandre Taillefer, who would later serve as campaign director for former Quebec Liberal leader and premier Philippe Couillard.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Legault said the relative lack of Quebec-made products sold on Amazon is a significant concern for him. He wanted to be assured that Amazon would not just be selling American-made products to Quebecers.</p>
      <p>Fitzgibbons went even further, saying the government would be open to investing in a Quebec version of Amazon, so long as it is sustainable. He said the goal of such a platform would be to help Quebec retailers, who he said are not very present on Amazon.</p>
      <p>"We have products, and we have nationalist clients who want to buy Quebec (products), so maybe it's time to start looking more closely at such a structure," Fitzgibbon said.</p>
      <p>Legault and Fitzgibbon's comments come less than two weeks after Amazon announced it would soon be opening its first warehouse in Quebec, which it says will create 300 jobs.</p>
