      <h3>Speed limits could be going up on roads near the Chief Mistawasis Bridge, depending on the findings of a Saskatoon city hall study.</h3>
      <p>City council voted Monday to task the city administration with <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/saskatoon-city-hall-to-study-speed-on-chief-mistawasis-bridge-roadway">studying the feasibility of raising the speed limit</a> on the extension of McOrmond Drive that was built to connect to the bridge.</p>
      <p>The study approved by council replaces a less specific study approved earlier this month by council’s transportation committee.</p>
      <p>Residents have expressed frustration with the shifting speed limits along McOrmond that includes stretches of 70 kilometres per hour, 60 km/h and 50 km/h through the ecologically sensitive Northeast Swale.</p>

      <p>“I can certainly express confusion and frustration on behalf of the 33,000 folks that I represent,” Coun. Zach Jeffries, who represents the area southeast of the bridge, told council on Monday.</p>
      <p>Council voted 8-3 in favour of the engineering study and for information about traffic infractions and wildlife deaths and comparisons to other roads surrounding Saskatoon.</p>
      <p>Coun. Sarina Gersher, Coun. Hilary Gough and Coun. Mairin Loewen voted against the study.</p>
      <p>Loewen pointed out she could not think of another area like the Northeast Swale; the city’s director of transportation, Jay Magus, concurred.</p>
      <p>Council had opted to keep the speed limit through the swale at 50 km/h to protect wildlife and motorists.</p>
      <p>“We knew at the time of the design that we would be putting roadway through an ecologically sensitive area,” Loewen said. “When we choose to put infrastructure through spaces like that, it means we have to expect a certain level of inconvenience to protect these areas.”</p>

      <p>Coun. Cynthia Block said she wants to examine speed limits near the swale, but does not intend to support an increase in speed through the swale. Coun. Darren Hill said he supports gathering the data, but has not decided on a course of action once the information is received.</p>
      <p>The roadway through the swale covers about 800 metres, but the overall roadway built to connect to the bridge stretches more than nine kilometres.</p>
      <p>Loewen said she believe the “availability and integrity of data” will pose a problem.</p>
      <p>SGI spokesman Tyler McMurchy said in an email that the government insurance agency does not yet have collision statistics to share for the extensions of McOrmond and Central Avenue that connect to the bridge.</p>
      <p>Amy Wall, marketing and fund development manager for the Meewasin Valley Authority, said the conservation agency does not have data on wildlife collisions near the swale. The MVA is working on a framework to monitor wildlife throughout the river valley, but currently lacks the resources, Wall said.</p>
      <p>The consortium that built the bridge and connecting roads, Graham Commuter Partners, has removed 17 animal carcasses, including 11 deer, since the roads opened. Graham is also tasked with maintenance of the infrastructure for 30 years.</p>
      <p>None of the carcasses were found in the stretch through the swale.</p>
      <p>“I think what we’re actually aiming for is a low number of wildlife deaths,” Loewen said.</p>
      <p>City statistics show the bridge accommodated about 9,900 vehicles daily based on data gathered earlier this year. That’s thousands fewer than expected.</p>
