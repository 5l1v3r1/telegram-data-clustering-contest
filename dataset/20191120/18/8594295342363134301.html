      <p>When Dodge first built a Challenger, back in 1959, it was actually a Coronet. A decade later, the car returned as the spiritual foundation of the coupe we know today. Presumably, the name is intended to represent Chrysler rising to meet the Challenges laid by rival manufacturers already building American muscle. But we can nitpick here endlessly, going back to the 1950s and giving the pentastar brand plenty of credit for going bananas on horsepower.</p>
      <p>It would actually take decades for us to realize the Challenger’s true purpose — serving as a canvas for a hilarious number of special edition vehicles. Thankfully, they usually turn out to be fairly enjoyable and totally on brand, leaving us with little to complain about.</p>
      <p>For the Challenger’s 50th anniversary, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles plans to offer limited production Dodges in new colors with commemorative bling. It’s basically the same recipe Ford used for the 50th Anniversary Mustang but with some additional brashness from Dodge. However, while those Fords only came in Wimbledon White and Kona Blue, the Challenger comes in every high-impact paint color FCA has at its disposal — including Gold Rush. </p>

      <p>Both models paid homage to the vehicles’ heritage, but Dodge has always managed to stay much closer to its roots (and out of its mind) with the Challenger. That’s a double-edged sword, with no shortage of pitfalls. You can’t argue with the results, especially if you’re interested in a roaring grand tourer positively dripping with nostalgia. However, we also know it’s not an automobile suited to everybody’s taste.</p>
      <p>FCA says all Challenger 50th Anniversary Editions will receive an interior comprised largely of Nappa leather and Alcantara with Sepia accent stitching, real carbon fiber accents, and unique 50 badging throughout. That includes the gauge cluster and seat backs, in case you suddenly forgot where the extra money went.</p>

      <p>Limited to just 1960 examples, Dodge is breaking everything down by color — issuing 280 models in Gold Rush, Frostbite, Hellraisin, Sinamon Stick, TorRed, F8 Green (a personal favorite), and Go Mango. That is further broken down into four models, which get 70 examples of each color.</p>
      <p>Those include the Dodge Challenger GT RWD (the only model that doesn’t receive a shaker hood as standard), R/T Shaker, R/T Scat Pack Shaker, and the latter’s wide-body counterpart. They’ll all be issued a plaque indicating their production order in the aforementioned groups of 70. Special edition models receive retro wheels Dodge is calling “Gold School” and gunmetal brakes. The latter item is, once again, optional on the rear-drive GT.</p>

      <p>AWD Challengers are ineligible, but 50th anniversary touches will be fitted to all 2020 model-year Challenger SRT Hellcat and Hellcat Redeye models by default.</p>
      <p>Dodge says it’s asking an extra $4,995 for the Challenger 50th Anniversary Edition, but that only applies to the lowest trim level. Climbing the ladder ends at $5,995 with the Scat Pack cars, which <i>do</i> come with the most content. Orders open next month, with deliveries commencing in the spring.</p>
