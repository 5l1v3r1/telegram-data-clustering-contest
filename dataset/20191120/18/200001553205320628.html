      <h1>Rangers ‘too greedy’ for club to make move for star in January – Summer could be ‘different’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:16:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/tom-coast/" target="_blank">Tom Coast</a></address>
      <p>Following comments from Alfredo Morelos saying <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/alfredo-morelos-reveals-desire-leave-rangers-january-wants-competitive-football/">he’d like to leave Rangers in January if the right opportunity came along</a>, Saint-Etienne in France have been linked a fair bit in the past week or so.</p>
      <p>It’s been stated Claude Puel, who took over at the Ligue 1 side on October 4th, is a big fan of the Colombian striker and had added him to his list of desired transfers in the future.</p>
      <p>Le Progrès on Tuesday stated that while Rangers and Steven Gerrard had no intention of parting ways with their star goalscorer in January, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/manager-likes-rangers-stars-profile-included-recruitment-list-hard-cash-key-convincing-club/">‘hard cash’ could be the solution to convince all parties of the move</a>.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/exclu-mercato-asse-le-point-sur-le-dossier-morelos-rangers-481729?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Le10 Sport on Wednesday</a> believe the Scottish side are being ‘too greedy’ for a transfer in the next couple months, and the dossier ‘hasn’t advanced yet’.</p>
      <p>The French website do report that Saint-Etienne went to see Morelos in action twice last months, first on October 3rd against Young Boys before travelling to Portugal to watch Rangers draw against Porto on October 24th.</p>
      <p>So there’s little chance of anything happening in January, but Le10 do say that ‘it could be different’ in the summer ‘as long as the prices don’t go too high by then’.</p>
