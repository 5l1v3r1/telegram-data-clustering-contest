      <p>At the beginning of the decade, in the 2011/12 season, Newcastle United were on cloud nine after finishing in fifth position in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It was a fantastic season for the club, with Demba Ba the club's top goalscorer, featuring alongside players like Moussa Sissoko, Hatem Ben Arfa, Papiss Cisse, Yohan Cabaye and Fabricio Coluccini.</p>
      <p>But, that was as good as it got for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">the Magpies,</a> who were relegated just four seasons later, before being promoted back to the Premier League in 2017/18.</p>
      <p>As we approach the next decade, you can't help but wonder how the next decade could turn out for Newcastle.</p>
      <p>What will the team look like in 2030? And, who will make the Team of the Decade?</p>
      <p>We used Football Manager 2020 to predict what might happen over the next decade. You know, for a bit of fun.</p>
