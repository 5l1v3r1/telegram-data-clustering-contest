      <h1>Bus priority lane: Citizens step in to spread the word</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:53:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Jayasimha-K-R-8425/" target="_blank">Jayasimha K.R.</a></address>
      <p>While authorities are struggling to ensure that motorists steer clear of the BMTC bus priority lane on Outer Ring Road (ORR) from Central Silk Board to Tin Factory (K.R. Puram), a group of residents and commuters have taken up the task of spreading awareness on the rules and encouraging people to use public transport.</p>
      <p>Every day, Deepak N. can be seen riding his motorcycle to and from work with a placard strapped to his backpack. He has printed a BBMP poster on the placard in the hope that people will read it. “I usually commute by bus, but I’ve been using my motorcycle instead over the last few days to spread a message,” he said. When he sees motorists on the bus lane, he rides up to them and urges them to follow the rules. “I have been doing it for the past four days and the response has been quite encouraging. I think there is a change and it will take time. I have requested all my friends and colleagues to join me,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Deepak has also made a short video where BMTC drivers and conductors talk about the problems they face. He plans to make a few more such videos. Civic group Bellandur Jothege is helping him with this initiative.</p>
      <p>His colleague, Ashwini Kumari B., is also part of the initiative. “Before this, I would shout at them. Now, I request using the placard. “We are able to grab the attention of the people and to their credit, many have obliged to move from the priority lane,” she said.</p>
      <p>Starting this Friday, volunteers of Bellandur Jothege plan to stand on ORR, from Iblur Junction to Eco Space Flyover, with placards and posters. K.G. Mohan of Bellandur Jothege said they would continue such initiatives for a few weeks at regular intervals. “Along with awareness creation, punitive action should be taken against those who use the bus-priority lane,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Mohan, who commutes through ORR regularly, has also been taking videos of the bus-priority lane every day to monitor its success. “Over the past few days, there has been some change in motorists’ behaviour, but we have a long way to go,” he said. BMTC personnel and traffic police have also been handing out leaflets to motorists.</p>
