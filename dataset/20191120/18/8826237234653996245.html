      <h1>U.S. Envoy Says Time Running Short for North Korea Deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:24:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://time.com/author/associated-press/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>(WASHINGTON) — The U.S. official in charge of talks with North Korea says time is running short to achieve a deal, but not because of the end-of-year deadline set by Kim Jong Un.</p>
      <p>U.S. envoy Stephen Biegun tells the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that any crisis or other distraction could derail talks.</p>
      <p>Biegun says the “window is still open” but the North Koreans “need to seize the moment.” The envoy says Kim needs to grant more authority to his negotiating team.</p>
      <p>Biegun says the U.S. has seen no “concrete evidence” that North Korea intends to denuclearize.</p>
      <p>Negotiations faltered after the U.S. rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities.</p>
