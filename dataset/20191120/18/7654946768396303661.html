      <p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A dance teacher who appeared on a reality TV show has pleaded guilty in Tennessee to raping a teenage student and exposing him to the AIDS virus.</p>
      <p>The Shelby County district attorney’s office said Tuesday that 30-year-old John Conner III avoided trial when he pleaded guilty to criminal exposure to HIV, statutory rape by an authority figure and solicitation of a minor.</p>
      <p>Investigators say Conner was 26 when he had unprotected sex with a 16-year-old boy he met on social media.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Conner did not tell the teen that he had HIV. The boy later tested positive for HIV.</p>
      <p>Conner has appeared on the Lifetime show “Bring It.” His sentencing is scheduled on Dec. 20.</p>
      <p>Conner has two other cases pending involving sexual partners ages 17 and 24.</p>
