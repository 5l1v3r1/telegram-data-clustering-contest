      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has acknowledged it would be a “big step” for her to get to Number 10 from the party’s current poll ratings.</p>
      <p>After months of insisting that she was a credible contender for Prime Minister, Ms Swinson appeared to change tack by saying supporting the Lib Dems was the best way of denying Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Tories a majority.</p>
      <p>While insisting it was still possible for her to be PM, Ms Swinson told the BBC: “I’m the Liberal Democrat candidate to be prime minister. Not a single vote has been cast in this election. People still do have a genuine choice.</p>
      <p>“I recognise that is a big step to take from where the polls look like they are right now.”</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson said she did not rule out a government of national unity in the event of a hung Parliament.</p>
      <p>Launching the Lib Dem manifesto, Ms Swinson insisted the policy platform showed it is not a “one-trick” anti-Brexit party.</p>
      <p>However, Ms Swinson admitted the Lib Dems are suffering a “squeeze” in the polls.</p>
      <p>She admitted it would be a “big step” for her to enter Downing Street given the party’s current ratings, the BBC reported.</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson insisted the party would do better than the opinion polls predicted, stating: “There has obviously been a bit of a squeeze, but at this point in the 2017 election the polls weren’t a very good indicator to what actually happened in the final outcome.”</p>

      <p>Pressed on whether her leadership style could be rubbing voters up the wrong way, Ms Swinson told the PA news agency: “I’m certainly finding that when I meet with people, I’m getting a perfectly warm and enjoyable response, having good conversations with people across the country.”</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems are currently standing in the mid-teens in a number of opinion polls after besting Labour and hitting the early 20s in recent months.</p>
      <p>On a campaign visit to Cambridge, Ms Swinson insisted the Lib Dems have a wide-ranging agenda.</p>

      <p>She told PA: “We have got ambitious plans for free childcare.</p>
      <p>“We have ambitious plans to tackle the mental health crisis.</p>
      <p>“We have bold plans to deal with the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>“And significant investment in schools to give children the best start in life.</p>
      <p>“All of those things, absolutely, become much easier to do if we stop Brexit and have the benefits of remaining in the European Union.</p>
      <p>“There is a whole Liberal Democrat agenda which is a plan for a brighter future for our country.”</p>
