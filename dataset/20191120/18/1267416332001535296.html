      <h1>Digital sketches of OnePlus 8 series showcase hole-punch cameras</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:57:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p>The OnePlus 8 series won’t launch until next year, but digital sketches of the upcoming handsets have leaked online.</p>
      <p>The sketches indicate that the phone sports four rear-facing cameras. The sketches go hand-in-hand with digital renders of the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/18/oneplus-8-pro-renders-hole-punch-camera/">device posted by OnLeaks.</a></p>

      <p>On top of the four rear-facing camera setup, the handsets will sport hole-punch front cameras similar to the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/03/08/samsung-galaxy-s10-s10-plus-s10e-review/">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> series. It seems the OP8 Pro will feature dual front-facing cameras, whereas the OP8 is expected to have a single front-facing shooter.</p>
      <p>The sketches indicate the OP8 series will look similar to each other, unlike the company’s previous launch. The <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/09/26/oneplus-7t-review-consumers-choice/">OnePlus 7T Pro and 7T</a> look almost nothing alike.</p>
      <p>Even though the digital sketches and renders corroborate with one another, one should take this with a grain of salt, especially with how far we are from the official launch.</p>
