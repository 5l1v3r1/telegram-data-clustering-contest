      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Georgia-Texas A&amp;M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:56:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Georgia and Texas A&amp;M will meet this weekend in Athens with plenty at stake. The Bulldogs are currently the No. 4 in the College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>Georgia has a stranglehold on the SEC East, but must win its final two regular season contests and the conference championship game to reach the playoff. Texas A&amp;M is the next obstacle in their path.</p>
      <p>The Aggies are 7-3 and all three of their losses are of the “good” variety. Alabama, Auburn and Clemson are the only teams to beat A&amp;M, which has won four games in a row.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly has unveiled his score prediction for the game, using his SP+ formula.</p>
      <p>He likes the Bulldogs by two touchdowns.</p>
