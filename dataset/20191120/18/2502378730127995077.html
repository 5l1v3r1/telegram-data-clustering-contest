      <h3>So many questions need answering!</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a29750843/lizzie-mcguire-reboot-news-cast-spoilers-date/"><i>Lizzie McGuire</i> reboot</a> just got way more exciting. According to <a href="https://nylon.com/disney-plus-movies-tv-shows">Disney+</a>, our forever crush Gordo might just have another chance at winning over Lizzie's heart, as Adam Lamberg signed on to resume his role opposite Hilary Duff. Though it's already been shared that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/interview-hilary-duff-younger-finale-lizzie-mcguire.html">Lizzie won't be romantically involved with Gordo</a> at the beginning of the rebooted series— she's found her dream man that <i>isn't </i>him — we can only hope his crush has persisted throughout the years and that he'll be making moves soon enough.</p>

      <p>"Gordo was an essential piece of the puzzle to what made the original <i>Lizzie McGuire</i> so authentic and beloved," Duff said in a statement. "I couldn't imagine the series without him. I can't wait for fans to see what he's up to 15 years later and how he fits into Lizzie's adult world."</p>
      <p>So how <i>does </i>a former flame fit into McGuire's adult world? Does her new beau know about her past with Gordo? How did she and Gordo fizzle out? Answers are needed ASAP, especially after she revealed that <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/is-ethan-craft-in-the-lizzie-mcguire-reboot-hilary-duff-has-the-answer-19310992">former high school heartthrob Ethan Craft</a> will also be making an appearance in the reboot. There are so many juicy subplots to be revisited in the reboot! For now, check out Duff and Lamberg's adorable announcement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=cnQzXXSTNfo&amp;feature=emb_logo">here</a>, and start rewatching the series before the reboot drops in 2020.</p>
