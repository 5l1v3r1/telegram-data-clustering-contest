      <p>Many Congress workers joined the Janata Dal (Secular) in K.R. Pet on Tuesday promising that they would work for the victory of B.L. Devaraj in the byelections to K.R. Pet Assembly segment on December 5.</p>
      <p>Former Ministers H.D. Revanna and C.S. Puttaraju welcomed them by offering them JD(S) flags. Prominent among those who quit the Congress is M.B. Harish, former president, Mandya Milk Union Ltd. (MANMUL). He was a hardcore loyalist of former Minister and Congress leader N. Cheluvarayaswamy.</p>
      <p>According to him, the Congress nominee in the elections, K.B. Chandrashekar, had worked against him in the recently held elections to the MANMUL and that had prompted him to leave the Congress.</p>
