      <p>The Duke of York is to step back from public duties for the “foreseeable future”, in an unprecedented move for a royal in modern times.</p>
      <p>Andrew – the Queen’s second son – made the bombshell statement after mounting pressure in the wake of his interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Firms including telecoms giant BT and bank Barclays were among a growing number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities which distanced themselves from Andrew amid the fall-out from the Newsnight programme.</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor branded the move “absolutely unprecedented”.</p>
      <p>She said the decision was inevitable and had probably averted a crisis, but the monarchy was going through very difficult times.</p>
      <p>“This is absolutely unprecedented that a fairly senior member of the royal family should be forced to retire from public life,” she said.</p>
      <p>The royal writer told the PA news agency: “With all the events of the last year put together, I think the monarchy is going through very difficult times… I think it’s been a disastrous year.”</p>
      <p>There have been ongoing discussions within the family about the current situation with Andrew talking to the Queen and Prince of Wales, it is understood.</p>
      <p>The duke met with the Queen on Wednesday, visiting her at Buckingham Palace before his decision was announced.</p>
      <p>The duke, in a statement released on his parents’ 72nd wedding anniversary, said that the Queen had given her permission for him to bow out of royal duties.</p>
      <p>He said he was willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency, and expressed sympathy with Epstein’s victims – which he had been accused of not showing in his BBC interview.</p>
      <p>Andrew said: “It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>

      <p>“I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>“His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>“I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency.”</p>
      <p>Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein’s victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the disgraced financier, who took his own life while in prison earlier this year.</p>
      <p>In the Newsnight interview, the duke denied claims that he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein’s victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage.</p>

      <p>He said the alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>Ms Giuffre said the same alleged sexual liaison began with the duke sweating heavily as they danced at London nightclub Tramp.</p>
      <p>But the duke said he had a medical condition at the time which meant he did not sweat.</p>
      <p>He said he had no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre.</p>
      <p>When asked by the BBC’s Emily Maitlis if he regretted the “whole friendship with Epstein”, the duke replied: “Now, still not and the reason being is that the people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn either by him or because of him were actually very useful.”</p>
      <p>The duke cancelled a visit to flood-ravaged communities in South Yorkshire on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>He faced a barrage of firms and other organisations terminating or reviewing their association with his Pitch@Palace tech entrepreneurs initiative.</p>
      <p>Barclays said it was concerned about the situation and was keeping its involvement with Pitch@Palace under review, while BT warned that it would only continue to back a digital skills award programme iDEA if Andrew was dropped as patron.</p>
      <p>Asian-focused bank Standard Chartered joined KPMG in deciding not to renew its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>London Metropolitan University was considering the duke’s role as its patron, while a student panel at Huddersfield University passed a motion to lobby Andrew to resign as its chancellor.</p>
