      <h1>Hedge fund Alden becomes Tribune's largest shareholder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:39:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">TALI ARBEL, AP Business Writer</a></address>
      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Hedge fund Alden Global Capital is now the largest shareholder of Tribune Publishing, the company that owns the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and New York Daily News.</p>
      <p>Tribune says Alden, a hedge fund known for layoffs and slashing costs at newspapers it acquires, purchased the 25% stake from former Tribune chairman Michael Ferro. Tribune says it's talking with Alden about adding two board seats.</p>
      <p>Ferro stepped down as chairman in 2018 amid sexual misconduct accusations. His time at Tribune was marked by a much-maligned company name change to "Tronc," later reverted; the sale of the Los Angeles Times; and pushing off an unsolicited merger bid from rival Gannett.</p>
      <p>Another newspaper chain, GateHouse, now owns Gannett. The newspaper industry is consolidating as it struggles with a digital transition.</p>
