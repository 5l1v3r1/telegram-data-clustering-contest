      <p>Drivers engaged by educational institutions for tours going out of their way to impress and win over students is nothing new.</p>
      <p>In a different era their actions would have been at best confined to snaps not bringing opprobrium unlike in this age of social media, which two drivers learnt the hard way earlier this month.</p>
      <h3>Shift gears</h3>
      <p>The Kerala Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) suspended the licence of a driver after a social media post emerged of a few girls gleefully shifting gears even as he drives along with an approving smile. Apparently, one of the students from a college in Kalpetta, who were on a trip to Goa, had captured it.</p>
      <p>Soon, Transport Commissioner R. Sreelekha received a complaint. “An inquiry ensued and the driver readily admitted his guilt, following which his licence was suspended for six months,” said C.V.M. Sharief, Joint Regional Transport Officer, Kalpetta.</p>
      <p>A similar incident surfaced soon, again on social media, of a driver of a tourist bus singing while holding microphone on one hand and controlling the vehicle with the other. He was taking the students of a Kochi-based medical institution to Kanhangad and the incident took place at Valapattanam.</p>
      <p>The social media post caught the attention of B. Shefiq, Joint RTO, Perumbavur, who traced the bus. “The owner, who was summoned for a hearing, blamed it on the driver. An inquiry established the guilt of the driver, who has been asked to appear with a reply to our show-cause notice on Friday,” he said.</p>
      <p>In all likelihood, his licence will be suspended for six months under Rule 21(6).</p>
      <p>Both the incidents have been shared by the Kerala police on their official Facebook page.</p>
      <p>“Enforcement agencies have limitations in these cases and it is for faculty members accompanying students in these trips to ensure that neither drivers engage in actions raising safety threats nor students egg them on into such actions,” said K. Manoj Kumar, RTO, Ernakulam.</p>
