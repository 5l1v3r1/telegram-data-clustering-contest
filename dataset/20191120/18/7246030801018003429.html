      <p>An Orthodox Jewish man was stabbed multiple times in Monsey while walking to synagogue at around 5:40 am Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The man, who was discovered lying on the ground bleeding, told members of the Rockland Hatzolah emergency response service what happened to him before he lost consciousness.</p>
      <p>The victim reportedly told the medics that a vehicle pulled up and two men got out, beat him up and then stabbed him repeatedly before getting back into their vehicle and driving away.</p>
      <p>Security footage from the area has verified the victim’s account. Ramapo Police have launched an investigation.</p>
      <p>Medics rushed the victim to Westchester Trauma Center, where he underwent emergency surgery.</p>
      <p>He is currently listed in critical condition. The public is being asked to pray for the swift and complete recovery of Mordechai ben Bracha.</p>
