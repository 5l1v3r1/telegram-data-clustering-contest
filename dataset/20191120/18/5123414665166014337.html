      <h1>Expressive E Announces New Osmose Keyboard Controller</h1>
      <h2>Say hello to the future of MIDI controllers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:34:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.magneticmag.com/author/kane-michael/" target="_blank">Kane</a></address>
      <p>Today, Expressive E, the company behind the MPE controller Touché, has announced the next chapter in their product line, the Osmose. Where the Touché was a smaller hand controller, the Osmose is a full 49-key MIDI controller capable of unlocking the real power of your hardware and software synths. MPE is quickly and thankfully becoming the new standard when it comes to designing new hard and soft synths, and Expressive E's experience in the field has lead them to create a controller like nothing before. Hardware only fans can also rejoice, as the Osmose is capable of being used as a standalone MIDI controller, removing the need for a computer.  </p>
