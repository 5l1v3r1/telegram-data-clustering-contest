      <h1>Chiefs To Welcome Back Midfielder?</h1>

      <p>They may have three suspensions going into this weekend’s important Telkom Knockout semifinal, but there could be some good news on the injury front for Kaizer Chiefs.</p>

      <p>The Glamour Boys have Willard Katsande and Daniel Akpeyi out for one game after they picked up their fourth yellow cards of the season in the last match against Orlando Pirates, while Erick Mathoho will serve the first of his two-game ban against Maritzburg United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>With Katsande out, Ernst Middendorp will be hoping to see a return for Kearyn Baccus following his injury problems, and he is thought to be in contention after narrowly missing out on the matchday squad for the Soweto Derby earlier in the month.</p>
      <p>Baccus, if fit enough, could be a perfect option to come in and replace the suspended Zimbabwean in the centre of the park for the Glamour Boys, while Nkosingiphile Ngcobo could also be an option in the midfield after he got his first 90 minutes over the weekend in since his Achilles rupture back in March.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen who Middendorp will opt to use as he is forced into changes against his former employers, but the Team of Choice also have problems of their own with the likes of Siyanda Xulu and Kwanda Mngonyama missing due to injury and suspension.</p>

      <p>The German coach will be assessing his players over the coming days ahead of Sunday’s game before they make the trip to Nelspruit with their squad later in the week.</p>
