      <h1>Teen Boy Admits Killing 13-Year-Old Girl Over ‘Pregnancy Scare’</h1>

      <p>A teen boy named Isiah Lynch has admitted to shooting a 14-year-old girl dead after falsely believing that she was pregnant with his child.</p>
      <p>According to Canton Rep, he pleaded true — the juvenile equivalent of guilty —Wednesday to a murder charge for the March fatal shooting of the 14-year-old identified as Sylvia McGee.</p>
      <p>Sylvia McGee was shot in the head with a .38-calibre pistol not far from her home in Canton, Ohio, in March.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>‘That is what I believe got this whole thing started,’ Stark County Assistant Prosecutor Michelle Cordova said last Wednesday according to the <a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/news/20191113/update-false-pregnancy-rumor-led-to-sylvia-mcgeersquos-murder">Canton Rep</a>.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>‘There was no evidence of any other reason for this.’</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Cordova added that an autopsy had found that McGee was not pregnant.</p>
      <p>McGee’s great aunt, Carlina Hanley, told the Canton paper: ‘[He] should have just admitted it from the beginning. She didn’t deserve that … She wasn’t that type of a kid. She was upbeat and funny. I just can’t believe that he did that.’</p>
      <p>Her grandmother, Sylvia Milina, told ABC at the time of Sylvia’s death: ‘She didn’t even have a chance … It was like it was a set up to me because she’s never been out at that time.’</p>
      <p>The boy accepted a plea deal to bring an aggravated murder charge down to murder and will remain in a youth detention facility until he is 21-years-old and then undergoes a psychological evaluation.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, the boy could then be sent to an adult prison for 18 years to life, the Stark County prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>Lynch’s sentencing is set to hold in January.</p>
