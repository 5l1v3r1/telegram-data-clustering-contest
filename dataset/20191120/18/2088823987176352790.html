      <p>For the second straight week, Buffalo Bills fans can shout "We're No.1."</p>
      <p>Ratings for Buffalo Bills games are routinely hitting season highs every week largely due to the team’s 7-3 record.</p>
      <p>The Bills’ 37-20 victory over the Miami Dolphins Sunday had a season-high 43.9 rating on WIVB-TV, the local CBS affiliate. Buffalo ranked No. 1 among all CBS markets carrying NFL games Sunday.</p>
      <p>The rating Sunday was seven-tenths of a point higher than the previous high 43.2 rating for the Bills’ 19-16 loss to the Cleveland Browns a week earlier when the Buffalo market also had the highest-rated game on CBS that Sunday.</p>
      <p>The rating for the Cleveland game was a point higher than the previous high of 42.2 for the Bills’ 24-9 victory over Washington and their 31-13 loss to Philadelphia. Both games were carried on WUTV, the local Fox affiliate.</p>
      <p>Bills games are easily the highest-rated programs in Western New York at a time few prime-time entertainment programs get double digit-ratings.</p>
      <p>By comparison, the Bills-Dolphins game had an 11.3 rating on the CBS affiliate in Miami.</p>
      <p>However, Buffalo is one of the smallest markets in the NFL, which means lower ratings in bigger markets can have considerably more viewers.</p>
      <p>The Buffalo market is No. 52 in the country, with each rating point equaling 5,767 households. The Miami-Fort Lauderdale market is No. 16, with each point equaling 16,422 households.</p>
      <p>That means about 253,700 households watched the game in the Buffalo market and about 185, 570 households watched in the Miami market.</p>
