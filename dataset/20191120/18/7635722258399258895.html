        <b>Britain's Prince Andrew has said he is stepping back from public duties, following an interview about his links to convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The son of Queen Elizabeth II said he "let the side down" as a member of the British royal family.</p>
      <p>The scandal involving the American billionaire and allegations against the prince led Buckingham Palace to issue a number of unexpected statements in the past four years - denying the prince had sex with a 17-year-old girl and that he knew anything of Epstein's crimes against underage girls.</p>
      <p>In an interview <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/britains-prince-andrew-speaks-relationship-jeffrey-epstein-925849">with BBC's Newsnight</a></b>Â last week, he was asked about why he stayed with Epstein after the billionaire had admitted having sex with an underage girl.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said: "I stayed with him and that's... that, as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that."</p>
      <p>Video taken in 2010 showed Prince Andrew looking out of the door of Epstein's mansion in New York as he was staying with the billionaire.</p>

      <p>It was two years after Epstein had been convicted of having sex with underage girls. Photos were also taken of the two men walking in Central Park.</p>
      <p>Those close to the prince said he had gone to America to tell Epstein that they could no longer be friends.</p>
      <p>In the interview, he was also asked about allegations made by one of Epstein's victims - Virginia Roberts - who claims she was made to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was 17-years-old, after a night out in London.</p>
      <p>The prince <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/britains-prince-andrew-says-pizza-restaurant-night-alleged-sex-teen-926016">claimed that he was in a pizza restaurant</a></b> on the night he was accused of having sex with Ms Roberts.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Wednesday, Prince Andrew said: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support."</p>
      <p>He said he asked Queen Elizabeth II if he could step back from public duties "for the foreseeable future" - and that she gave him permission.</p>
      <p>He added: "I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>
