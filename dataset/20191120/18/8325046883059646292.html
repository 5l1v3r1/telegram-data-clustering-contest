      <p>In his testimony before Congress on Wednesday, Sondland said that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11#what-sondland-said-behind-closed-doors-3">Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine</a> by conditioning military aid and a White House meeting on Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky carrying out the investigations he wanted into the Biden family.</p>
      <p>Sondland, who had no prior diplomatic experience before <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2018/05/trump_nominates_portland_hotel.html">Trump nominated him as the ambassador to the EU</a> in May 2018, <a href="https://skift.com/2019/10/16/provenance-hotels-faces-backlash-over-founders-role-in-trump-ukraine-deal/">began his career in commercial real estate</a> in Seattle.

      <p>The 62-year-old diplomat said Wednesday <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11#what-sondland-said-behind-closed-doors-3">that Trump engaged in a quid pro quo with Ukraine</a> by conditioning military aid and a White House meeting on Zelensky carrying out the investigations he wanted.</p>
      <p>Sondland didn’t originally support Trump’s presidential campaign, but after the election, <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2017/04/250-donors-shelled-out-100k-or-more-for-trumps-inauguration/">he donated $1 million for his inauguration.</a></p>

      <p><a href="https://skift.com/2019/10/16/provenance-hotels-faces-backlash-over-founders-role-in-trump-ukraine-deal/">Sondland entered the hotel business</a> while he was working in commercial real estate in Seattle in the 1980s, according to Skift. In 1985, he bought a bankrupt hotel, renovated it, and reopened it as a luxury hotel – the start of what would become Provenance Hotels.</p>
      <p>Sondland was <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/gordon-sondland-wealth-jet-art-house/">CEO of the hotel group from 2002 to 2018,</a> when he was appointed ambassador to the EU. In his financial disclosure to the State Department, Sondland said he would retain a passive investment in the company and continue to receive his share of equity profits.</p>
      <p>According to the Portland Business Journal, Sondland’s wife, Katherine Durant, was listed as <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2019/10/08/provenance-hotels-removes-gordon-sondlands-from.html">chairman of Provenance Hotels</a> on the company website’s <a href="https://provenancehotels.com/who-we-are">“Who We Are” page</a> as recently as October. All information appears to have since been removed from the page.</p>
      <p>Provenance Hotels did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment regarding its current chairman, and Sondland’s attorney did not respond to a request for comment concerning his current involvement in the company.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, Provenance Hotels <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/people-are-absolutely-trashing-gordon-sondlands-hotels-on-yelp">have come under fire on Yelp</a>, receiving one- and two-star reviews referencing the ambassador, The Daily Beast reported.</p>

      <h3>Between 2016 and June 2018, Sondland was the manager of a Portland-based LLC that owned a Lear jet, according to his financial disclosures.</h3>
