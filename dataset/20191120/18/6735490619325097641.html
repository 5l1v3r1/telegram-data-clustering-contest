      <p>And now, Cyrus and Simpson both focus on their health.</p>
      <p>“I try to eat well five days a week and then the other two I just see whatever,” he explains.</p>
      <p>Adding, “And that seems to be the most long-term sustainable thing. If I can go Monday, Friday and like eat really well yeah. And then Saturdays and Sundays do what, literally eat anything, whatever I want.”</p>
      <p>Simpson is mid-way through writing and recording a fourth studio album, his first in five years, which could feature Cyrus.</p>

      <p>“I don’t want to say too much about the new album because it’s a surprise,” he reveals.</p>
      <p>Following their month-and-a-half long whirlwind romance, rumours of Cyrus and Simpson’s split has made headlines this week, but according to <i><a href="https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1094707/miley-cyrus-and-cody-simpson-are-still-together-and-crazy-about-each-other-despite-split-report">E! News</a>,</i> everything is fine.</p>
      <p>“Miley and Cody saw each other last week when he visited her in Tennessee. They are fine and are still dating,” a source tells the outlet. “Miley has been resting from her vocal surgery but has been in touch and seen Cody recently.”</p>
