        <b>The Queen has given permission for Prince Andrew to step back from public duties amid criticism over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the duke said in a statement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It follows his TV interview about his friendship with the billionaire sex offender, who killed himself in a New York jail cell in August.</p>
      <p>In a statement Prince Andrew also said he's "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>
      <p>He wrote: “It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigation if required."</p>
      <p>Firms including telecoms giant BT and bank Barclays are among a number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities which have distanced themselves from Andrew in the wake of the BBC interview.</p>
