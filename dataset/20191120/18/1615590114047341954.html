      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1808" target="_blank">Rebekah Valentine</a></address>
      <p>Turkish mobile studio Dream Games has announced a $7.5 million seed funding investment to help it develop more casual puzzle titles.</p>
      <p>The investment comes from Makers Fund and Balderton Capital, and will be used to hire new talent to the Istanbul office, which aims to increase its numbers five-fold in the next two years. Dream Games aims to have 20 employees by the end of its first year.</p>
      <p>"Supercell built amazing games with very small teams, proving you don't need huge teams spread across regions to build something people want to play," said founder Soner Aydemir. "What you do need, however, is a talented team. We plan to focus our investments on building a highly skilled team to develop high-quality games."</p>
      <p>Dream Games was founded earlier this year by several former team members of Peak Games, which <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-11-07-zynga-turnaround-continues-as-company-buys-peak-games-for-usd100m">sold its card and board games outfit to Zynga back in 2017</a>.</p>
