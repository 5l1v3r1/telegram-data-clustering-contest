      <h2>Chrystia Freeland moves from foreign affairs to tackle fractured political landscape</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:56:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Kirby</a></address>
      <p>Justin Trudeau has announced a significant shake-up of his cabinet, including shuffling his former foreign affairs minister, Chrystia Freeland, into a new and crucial domestic role to address Canada’s fractured political landscape.</p>
      <p>Nearly one month after his Liberal party won re-election while failing to secure enough seats for a majority government, Mr Trudeau revealed the new cabinet of his minority government Wednesday in Ottawa.</p>
      <p>Ms Freeland, a former deputy editor of the Financial Times, who steered Canada through fraught negotiations with Washington on a new trade deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, is headed for a new portfolio as intergovernmental affairs minister, where she will work directly with provincial and territorial governments. She also becomes Mr Trudeau’s deputy prime minister.</p>
      <p>The election saw the Liberals <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc2dabfa-f47c-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654">shut out</a> in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. It was a stinging rebuke of Mr Trudeau’s energy and climate change policies, which saw the creation of a national carbon tax along with new environmental assessment rules that critics in the oil and gas sector warn will make it difficult to build new pipelines to relieve capacity constraints.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/423bdfb2-f6a9-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654">rising tide</a> of western alienation since the election has invigorated a fringe movement calling for the provinces to separate from Canada, dubbed Wexit. It has also prompted Jason Kenney, Alberta premier, to launch a “fair deal panel” of experts to consult with Albertans about establishing a provincial revenue agency, withdrawing from Canada’s national pension plan in favour of a new provincial one and even drafting a provincial constitution.</p>

      <p>In addition to the diplomatic skills Ms Freeland will bring to her new role in working with Mr Kenney, she was also born in northern Alberta, making her one of the few Liberals with any ties to the region.</p>
      <p>During the Nafta talks Ms Freeland corralled allies of US President Donald Trump in Congress, the Senate and among governors to press Canada’s position.</p>
      <p>“This ‘doughnut approach’ ensured that challenging personalities using populist political messaging were matched by a highly skilled team of Canadian communicators,” said Liberal strategist Shane Mackenzie. He said that Ms Freeland’s job as intergovernmental affairs minister will require a similar strategy to get Ottawa’s message across to people in the west.</p>
      <p>“At this time where the rhetoric is damaging to the ability to effectively work out a solution, she can mix her prairies roots with her Nafta renegotiation savvy towards a solution,” he said.</p>
      <p>François-Philippe Champagne, a former trade lawyer who most recently served as minister of infrastructure and communities, will step into the job as Canada’s top diplomat.</p>
      <p>He inherits several problematic files. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/43d19dba-c776-11e9-af46-b09e8bfe60c0">Diplomatic tensions</a> with China are high after the arrest of a Huawei executive on a US warrant for fraud last December. In retaliation China has detained two Canadians and enacted blockades on agricultural exports. A ban on Canadian pork and beef was recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be42bd22-0010-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">lifted</a>, but China is still restricting shipments of canola and soy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement to replace Nafta has yet to be ratified by lawmakers in either Canada or the US. Democratic lawmakers <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e116a4e0-f5e2-11e9-9ef3-eca8fc8f2d65">want changes</a> made to protect workers and the environment.</p>

      <p>Another major change to Mr Trudeau’s cabinet has seen Catherine McKenna shuffled out of the environment and climate change portfolio, replacing Mr Champagne in infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Mr Trudeau also tapped former intergovernmental affairs minister Jim Carr to serve as his special representative for the Prairies. Mr Carr, who is undergoing treatment for a form of blood cancer, was born and raised in Winnipeg. A statement from the prime minister’s Office said Mr Carr’s job was to “ensure that the people of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have a strong voice in Ottawa”.</p>
      <p>Mr Trudeau’s cabinet is larger than the 34-member cabinet of his first term and is made up of equal numbers of men and women.</p>

      <p>“Today, I can introduce the strong, diverse, and experienced team that will work together to tackle the big issues that matter to people . . . Whether it’s making life more affordable for the middle class, taking action on climate change, or keeping our communities safe we will continue working tirelessly for all Canadians,” said Mr Trudeau.</p>
      <p>Parliament is set to resume for the first time since the election on December 5. After a new speaker of the House is elected, Governor General Julie Payette will deliver Mr Trudeau’s speech from the throne, outlining the government’s priorities for the next session of parliament. A vote by MPs on the speech is considered a confidence vote and will be the first test of whether Mr Trudeau’s minority government can survive.</p>
