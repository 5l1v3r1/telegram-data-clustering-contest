      <h1>Oxford Circus: Commuter injured by train after falling off platform during rush hour</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:41:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>A commuter fell off the platform at Oxford Circus station on Wednesday evening, as passengers said crowds were "pushing and shoving" during rush hour.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said a man in his mid-20s fell in front of the train seconds before it pulled in at about 5.30pm, suffering leg injuries.</p>
      <p>He reportedly tried to haul himself back up but it all happened "too quickly" and he was unable to move out of the way in time.</p>
      <p>It comes just a week after another person was reportedly found under a train at the busy station. It was evacuated as firefighters and paramedics attended.</p>
      <p>In a separate incident in September, a man who collapsed on the tracks at Oxford Circus was rescued by heroic commuters who pulled him back onto the platform.</p>
      <p>Transport for London said there was no service on the Victoria line between Seven Sisters and Victoria, and severe delays have been reported on the rest of the line.</p>
      <p>The station was evacuated and emergency services attended.</p>
      <p>Ebony Rainford-Brent, who witnessed the incident, told The Telegraph: "I can't believe what I just saw. It's just a disgrace that the tube can get so packed like this and there be no crowd management.</p>
      <p>"There were no tube assistants moving people. I tried to step back because it was getting too much.</p>
      <p>"I was two metres away and he was two rows in front of me and people were packed in. The tube came down from the left and with about two seconds to go this guy, with all the pushing and shoving, I saw him fall.</p>
      <p>"He didn't look more than 25 years old, dark hair, black jacket. I pray for his family.</p>
      <p>"Everyone started pressing the panic alarm and everyone was screaming. People were crying and shouting. I looked around and some were just crying and wailing. It was so quick. ​</p>
      <p>"Then there was a message on the tannoy which said 'please stop pressing the panic button, we are aware of what's happening and please evacuate'.</p>
      <p>"I got in an Uber because I couldn't even face a tube. It's just not acceptable. You shouldn't be risking your life just going to and from work. There should be barriers and station management.</p>
      <p>"In the most sophisticated city in the world, how do we not have a system with doors like the Jubilee line? It's just not good enough."</p>
      <p>A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: “We were called at 5.33pm to reports of a person injured at Oxford Circus underground station.</p>
      <p>“We sent a number of resources to the scene including an incident response officer and our hazardous area response team. We also dispatched a trauma team from London’s Air Ambulance.</p>
      <p>"Crews treated a man at the scene with leg injuries and took him to a major trauma centre by road.”</p>
