      <h1>Sonos buys an AI startup to improve voice control for its speakers</h1>
      <h2>Snips could lead to speedy voice commands for basic playback.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:40:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Sonos might just be less reliant on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/18/sonos-one-review/">third-party assistants</a> for voice control. The company has <a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/investor-news/latest-news/2019/Sonos-Announces-Acquisition-of-Snips/default.aspx">bought</a> Snips, a Paris startup that helps create "tailored voice experiences" through its AI voice platform and tools. No, Sonos isn't planning to take on Alexa or Google Assistant -- rather, the company said in a <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/672173472/files/doc_financials/2019/Q4/FINAL-SONO-Q4-and-FY2019-Shareholder-Letter-112019(1).pdf">letter</a> that this is to "add to [Sonos] customers' ease of use and control" for music. Snips' speedy, private on-device voice processing is designed to sit alongside general assistants, suggesting that Sonos may reserve the custom voice control for basic functions like playback.</p>
      <p>Snips is a small, 50-person outfit, and that was reflected in the size and speed of the deal. Sonos bought the firm for $37.5 million, and it quietly closed on November 14th.</p>
      <p>The buyout is a recognition of an intensifying smart speaker market. Competitors have usually leaned more on voice assistants than audio quality to challenge Sonos, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-echo-studio-review.html">that gap is closing</a> -- it's now possible to get rival speakers that are comparable in both sound and smarts. Snips could help Sonos stand out by delivering performance that isn't possible elsewhere.</p>
