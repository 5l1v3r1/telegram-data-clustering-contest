      <h1>Here's a First Look at Nintendo's Official Store in Japan</h1>
      <h2>Nintendo’s first flagship store in its home country.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:41:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:41</time> by <a rel="author">Isaac Rouse</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has revealed the inside of its upcoming flagship store in its home country of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/japan">Japan</a> ahead of the location’s grand opening on November 22. Nintendo Tokyo will be located on the sixth floor of the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/shibuya-parco">Shibuya district’s Parco department store</a> and is set to showcase exclusive Nintendo merchandise and games for customers to demo, similar to its Rockefeller Center location in New York City.</p>
      <p>Press were invited to tour the store on November 19, and <i><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nintendo-seeks-to-sustain-switch-sales-with-stripped-down-console-11568975330?reflink=share_mobilewebshare">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> refers to a walking tour video posted via Twitter. Next to Nintendo Tokyo will be <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/the-pokemon-company">The Pokémon Company</a>‘s Pokémon-themed store, which is run separately from Nintendo. Nintendo Tokyo is the latest attempt from the company to expand its pop-culture influence beyond gaming, as Nintendo’s Shigeru Miyamoto was recently honored with a Japanese cultural award for his creation for classic titles like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub01mPDS-Z0"><i>Super Mario Bros.</i></a>. The game will also receive<a href="https://hypebeast.com/2017/11/super-mario-bros-movie-animated-nintendo"> an animated adaptation</a> from the studio that made <i>Dispicable Me</i>.</p>
      <p>In related news, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/tencent-nintendo-ip-console-gaming-plans">Tencent is reportedly planning to tap into Nintendo’s household characters</a>.</p>
