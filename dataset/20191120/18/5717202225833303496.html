      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:15:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal defender Rob Holding has praises Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s captaincy as well as showing support for former skipper Granit Xhaka.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11865746/arsenal-not-at-crisis-point-says-rob-holding">Sky Sports</a>, Holding has been effusive of how both men are around the dressing room after a period of uncertainty at the club..</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11670/11865746/arsenal-not-at-crisis-point-says-rob-holding">said</a>: “Pierre’s great in the dressing room. He’s such a happy character so everyone is positive around him. He knows how to lift people and he leads by example on the pitch. Having someone like that up front, scoring goals for you always make things easier.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never had any problems with Granit and none of the players have ever had any problems with him. He’s a great lad to have around the changing rooms and I just think what happened with him was between him and the fans and that is nothing to do with me. I just know I can support the team and support Granit.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Aubameyang will lead by example and is a more natural fit than Xhaka</h3>
      <p>Xhaka may have been a more vocal presence but should never have been captain, not least because he is not so good that his place in the side should be guaranteed.</p>
      <p>It was a similar situation when Harry Kane was named England captain; the role had to go to someone who was guaranteed to play every game and there weren’t too many around, just as there aren’t with Arsenal now.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang is definitely someone who falls into that category and his goalscoring consistency means he can become someone who leads by example, sometimes pulling his side out of the mire when they need it.</p>
