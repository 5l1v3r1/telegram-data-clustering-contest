      <h1>Canadian PM Trudeau shuffles cabinet, makes Freeland Deputy PM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:56:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday shuffled his cabinet. He moved Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland into a new position where she will be asked to help stave off a looming national unity crisis.</p>
      <h3>Key notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chrystia Freeland from Foreign Ministry to Intergovernmental Affairs Portfolio, also makes her Deputy PM.</li>
        <li>Francois-Philippe Champagne becomes new Canadian Foreign Minister.</li>
        <li>Bill Morneau stays as Finance Minister.</li>
        <li>Mary Ng is named Minister for Trade, Small Business and Export Promotion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, Freeland becomes minister of Intergovernmental Affairs as well as deputy prime minister where she will be expected to attend to the western oil-producing provinces, where we have seen tensions mounting due to  tough environmental protection laws. </p>
      <h4>FX implications: </h4>
      <p>USD/CAD is steady on the news and announcements, with traders most concerned for the Federal Open Market Committee minutes today, which resulted in much of the same and expected statements as we have head since the October cut. There is also a keen focus on US-Sino trade affairs as well as Hong Kong keeping the commodity complex in check for which CAD trades as a proxy to. </p>
