      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he planned a multi-billion-pound tax cut if he wins an election on Dec. 12, by raising the amount of earnings exempt from social security payments.</p>

      <p>The two main political parties are showcasing starkly different visions for the world’s fifth-largest economy ahead of the Dec. 12 election.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s Conservatives are promising to deliver Brexit while Labour says it wants to be the most radical socialist government in British history.</p>
      <p>Workers currently pay social security payments — known in Britain as National Insurance contributions (NICs) — on annual earnings over 8,632 pounds ($11,147), lower than the 12,000-pound threshold at which income tax becomes payable.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Johnson said he wanted to bring the National Insurance threshold in line with income tax. On Wednesday he said that would be a key goal if his Conservative Party forms Britain’s next government.</p>
      <p>Johnson told broadcasters he would raise the National Insurance to 9,500 pounds at the next budget and would then set out a timescale for further increases to 12,500 pounds.</p>
      <p>“We want to operate in a prudent way, but we do want to help now with the cost of living,” Johnson said.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent think-tank, said the initial cut in the threshold would cost the government around 2 billion pounds in the next financial year.</p>
      <p>“If the intention is to help the lowest paid, raising the NICs threshold is an extremely blunt instrument,” said Xiaowei Xu, research economist at the IFS, adding that raising in-work benefits to the lowest paid would be more effective.</p>
      <p>The opposition Labour Party said the policy was “stuck in the 1980s”.</p>
      <p>“Even after ten years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of 1.64 pounds a week, with those on Universal Credit (benefits) getting about 60 pence,” said Labour finance spokesman John McDonnell.</p>
      <p>Previous increases in the starting threshold for income tax were spread out over several years.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party has not yet formally released its full policy plans for the election.</p>
      <p>Johnson called the election in order to break a deadlock over Brexit in parliament.</p>
      <p>Finance minister Sajid Javid - who has announced big public spending increases - has said income tax cuts are unlikely.</p>
