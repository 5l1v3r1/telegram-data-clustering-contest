      <h1>Watch Leigh Griffiths score Celtic brace as striker responds to Neil Lennon's challenge</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops youngsters took on Stenhousemuir in a friendly at Lennoxtown with Griffiths handed a striking role.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:01:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:01</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Leigh Griffiths made a goalscoring return for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> as netted a brace for the reserves.</p>
      <p>The Hoops youngsters faced Stenhousemuir in a friendly at Lennoxtown with the striker leading the line.</p>
      <p>The  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a>  forward hasn’t played for the champions since a 3-1 victory over Hearts in late August. Following his personal problems the former Hibs star has been hit with niggling injuries and a virus.</p>
      <p>But he made an instant impact for the second string by scoring after 11 minutes as he stepped up his recovery.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was picked out by David McKay and he slipped the ball into the back of the net.</p>

      <p>Griffiths added a second three minutes later and this time it was former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> youngster Liam Burt who provided the assist.</p>
      <p>Burt moved across the divide in the summer and he played a stunning through ball to Griffiths who smashed it past the keeper.</p>
      <p>Burt then grabbed a double of his own as Celtic cruised into a dominant lead before half time and he got his hat-trick 10 minutes into the second half. Cameron Harper added a sixth.</p>
      <p>Before the international break <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> issued Griffiths with a challenge to get up to speed over the fortnight.</p>
      <p>He said: "We’re hoping to give him two good weeks of work, then he has a developmental game next week – see how he comes through that.</p>
      <p>“We want him up to speed, he’s not up to speed, not at the level that we want him at, he’s got to do the work in the next two weeks."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A return to form for Griffiths would be a welcome sight for Celtic as they prepare for a congested schedule over the winter months.</p>
      <p>Vakoun Issouf Bayo is on the sidelines with a knee injury so Lennon's men will be hoping to utilise Griff and lessen the load on star man Odsonne Edouard.</p>
