        <i>This post has been updated to reflect that, after deleting the tweet in question Wednesday, Rudy Giuliani posted another tweet with the same claims.</i>
      </p>
      <p>President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted a denial of a key detail in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, rejecting a witness’s testimony that Trump ordered him to work with Giuliani.</p>
      <p>EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/the-big-highlights-from-gordon-sondlands-public-impeachment-testimony">testified</a> Wednesday that during a May 23 meeting President Donald Trump directed him and others to work with Rudy.</p>
      <p>Sondland said he and others “worked with Mr. Rudy Giuliani on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the President of the United States.”</p>
      <p>Giuliani claimed that he “came into this at Volker’s request,” not Trump’s. He initially deleted the tweet shortly after posting it, but he then republished the same message.</p>

      <p>F0r his part, former Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IU_oSjvpeA">recalled</a> in testimony Tuesday that Trump said at the meeting to “talk to Rudy.” Volker claimed he didn’t take it as an order.</p>
      <p>Earlier Wednesday, Giuliani tweeted about the <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/white-house-releases-its-version-of-call-between-trump-and-ukraine-president">now-infamous</a> July 25 phone call in which Trump pressured Zelensky to pursue the investigations that would help Trump’s reelection campaign. Rudy got the date wrong.</p>

      <p>Though Trump floated a White House meeting to Zelensky on that call, it was a full two months before the two actually met.</p>
      <p>In that time, Giuliani, Sondland and others carried out the pressure campaign that <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/zelensky-nearly-announced-the-investigations-trump-wanted-then-everything-changed">nearly led Zelensky</a> to give Trump the “deliverable” he wanted — an announcement of the investigations.</p>
