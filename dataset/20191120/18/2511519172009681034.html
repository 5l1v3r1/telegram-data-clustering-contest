      <h1>WhatsApp 'secretly part of spy programme', Telegram founder claims</h1>
      <h2>Pavel Durov claims 'it's very unlikely that anyone can accidentally commit major security errors, conveniently suitable for surveillance, on a regular basis'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:21:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:21</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Cuthbertson</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-update-latest-spying-security-spyware-india-cert-nso-a9210236.html">major security flaw within WhatsApp</a> is further proof that spy agencies are habitually using it as a surveillance tool, the founder of rival messaging app Telegram has claimed.</p>
      <p>Pavel Durov supported this claim by pointing to a recent vulnerability that potentially exposed the private messages and photos of WhatsApp users – just months after a similar security bug was discoverd.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Russian entrepreneur joined mounting criticism against the Facebook-owned app by claiming that it <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-privacy-telegram-alternative-messaging-app-pavel-durov-a8916326.html">would never be truly secure</a>. He pointed to a succession of security flaws that had consistently put users’ private data at risk to hackers and government intelligence agencies.</p>
      <p>Building on this criticism in his latest Telegram post, Mr Durov described WhatsApp as a “Trojan Horse” being used to spy on users’ photos and messages across other apps.</p>
      <p>“Facebook has been part of surveillance programs long before it acquired WhatsApp,” he wrote. “It is naive to think the company would change its policies after the acquisition.”</p>
      <p>He pointed to comments by <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/facebook-whatsapp-change-privacy-encryption-messaging-app-jan-koum-a8330626.html">WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton’s remarks</a> regarding the sale of the app to Facebook, when he said: “I sold my users’ privacy to a larger benefit.”</p>
      <p>Facebook claimed that there was no evidence that the most recent flaw had been exploited by hackers, saying in a statement that “there is no reason to believe that users were impacted”.</p>
      <p>Mr Durov described this lack of evidence as “convenient”, saying that the lack of data stored on servers meant it would be impossible to discover instances of it being exploited.</p>
      <p>“Rest assured, a security vulnerability of this magnitude is bound to have been exploited,” he said. </p>
      <p>The consistency of security vulnerabilities being discovered within WhatsApp pointed to Facebook’s complicit involvement with governments and intelligence agencies.</p>
      <p>“It might be the case that WhatsApp just accidentally implements critical security vulnerabilities across all their apps every few months,” he wrote. </p>
      <p>“I doubt that – Telegram, a similar app in its complexity, hasn’t had any issues of WhatsApp-level severity in the six years since its launch. It’s very unlikely that anyone can accidentally commit major security errors, conveniently suitable for surveillance, on a regular basis.”</p>
      <p>Durov ended his post: “Unless you are cool wil all your photos and messages becoming public one day, you should delete WhatsApp from your phone”.</p>
      <p>Facebook and WhatsApp did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest allegations.</p>
