      <p>A studio executive once suggested Julia Roberts should play Harriet Tubman in a film about the anti-slavery crusader.<br/><br/>The movie "Harriet" which came out last month stars actress Cynthia Erivo.<br/><br/>The conversation happened 25 years ago.<br/><br/>The movie's script writer, Gregory Allen Howard, said one studio head said, "This script is fantastic. Let's get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman."<br/><br/>When someone pointed out that Roberts couldn't be Harriet, the executive responded, "It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference."<br/><br/>When talking about the episode, Allen said the climate in Hollywood was very different 25 years ago.<br/><br/>Allen told the story in an interview posted by Focus Features, the Studio behind "Harriet."</p>
