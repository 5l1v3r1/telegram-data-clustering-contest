      <p>Early this morning, news broke that not only is <i>Joker</i> director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver in negotiations <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485205/joker-sequel-officially-happening-joaquin-phoenix-likely-to-return">to helm a sequel for the Clown Prince of Crime</a>, Phillips is also in talks to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485223/what-other-dc-property-does-todd-phillips-now-have-the-rights-to">deliver more origin stories for DC Comics characters</a> that would have the same grounded and gritty feel as <i>Joker</i>. However, now new information has come in claiming that neither of these projects are a sure thing just yet.</p>
      <p>While the idea of a <i>Joker</i> sequel is still reportedly on the table, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a> reports that Todd Phillips and Scott Silver have not started hashing out a deal for such a project, let alone begun negotiations. The outlet also claims that Phillips did not meet with Warner Bros film chief Toby Emmerich about making other DC character origin stories, and that Phillips hasn’t even considered tackling such projects.</p>
      <p>Although <i>Joker</i> was originally intended to be a one-off story, and Todd Phillips said before the movie’s release that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480382/joker-director-todd-phillips-clarifies-sequel-comments">there were no plans for a sequel</a>, given <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485134/how-joaquin-phoenix-feels-about-jokers-success"><i>Joker</i>’s incredible commercial performance</a> and how it’s permeated pop culture, it’s understandable that Warner Bros would want to at least start talking about delivering a follow-up. Even Joaquin Phoenix has come around on the sequel idea and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483698/joaquin-phoenix-made-a-wonderfully-creative-argument-for-a-joker-sequel">talked with Phillips about it</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, while the news from earlier today made it seem like the proverbial <i>Joker 2</i> train was running full steam ahead, now another source alleges that it hasn’t even left the station. We’ll have to wait for more updates to learn just how far along talks between Todd Phillips and Warner Bros are concerning a <i>Joker</i> sequel, but if we’re to believe Deadline, progress is still a long ways off. Although maybe <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482765/why-joker-should-lead-to-an-anthology-rather-than-a-franchise">a <i>Joker</i> anthology should be considered instead</a>?</p>
      <p>As for these other DC character origin stories, those are even less of a certainty, but again, we’ll have to wait and see if one, let alone several of these kind of movies move forward. Fortunately for Warner Bros, there’s no shortage of DC villains who would be prime material for such treatment, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481747/6-dc-comics-villains-that-deserve-a-joker-like-movie">from Lex Luthor to Darkseid</a>.</p>
      <p>DC could easily carve out a niche for itself in the comic book adaptation realm with such unconventional and dark tales alongside the more ‘traditional’ fare that’s scheduled, like <i>Birds of Prey</i> and <i>Black Adam</i>. It’s one area that DC’s biggest competition, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, can’t operate in since it operates solely in PG-13 territory… well, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476522/deadpool-2-director-doesnt-know-if-marvel-is-making-a-third-movie">unless <i>Deadpool 3</i> gets off the ground</a>, in which case we’ll revaluate.</p>
      <p>As things stand now, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484966/joker-director-todd-phillips-celebrated-that-1-billion-box-office-in-a-unique-way"><i>Joker</i> has crossed the $1 billion mark</a>, making it only the fourth DC movie to do so, trailing behind <i>Aquaman</i>, <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> and <i>The Dark Knight</i>. There’s been a lot of talk about what <i>Joker</i>’s prospects in the coming awards season will look like, particularly for Joaquin Phoenix’s performance as Arthur Fleck, so stay tuned to CinemaBlend for updates on that front, as well as clarification regarding the sequel and other origin stories.</p>
      <p><i>Joker</i> is slowly wrapping up its time in theaters, so catch it while you still can, and be sure to read <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2478973/joker-review">CinemaBlend’s review of the movie</a>.
