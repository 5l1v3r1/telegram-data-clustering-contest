      <p>Members of the Stettler Curling Club, Stettler Health Services Foundation Board (SHSF), Stettler Town council and Mark Birtles of the Sandra Schmirler Foundation (SSF) gathered at the Stettler Curling Rink for the ceremonial presentation of $10,000 from the SSF to SHSF.</p>
      <p>The money was made possible through the Curling Club’s hosting of the Jiffy Lube Alberta Scottie’s ladies’ curling event last year.</p>
      <p>It will be used entirely to purchase a vital signs monitor for the Panda warmer that newborns are put in when born at the Stettler Hospital.</p>
