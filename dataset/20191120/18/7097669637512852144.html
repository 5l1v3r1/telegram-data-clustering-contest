      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon found $81 million of military equipment at a U.S. Navy facility that had not been inventoried, a top Pentagon official said on Wednesday as he described the Department of Defense second straight failed audit.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon says that it has made progress toward fixing accounting discrepancies, but that it will take years to eventually pass a full audit, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist told a U.S. Senate panel.</p>
      <p>One Navy base, the fleet logistics center in Jacksonville Florida, "identified $81 million worth of active material not tracked in the inventory system." They also eliminated "unneeded equipment" freeing up 4.6 acres (1.9 hectares) of space he said.</p>
      <p>A 1990 federal law mandated that U.S. government agencies be audited. Individual Pentagon programs have undergone audits, but the Pentagon had not faced a comprehensive audit until last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-audit/pentagon-fails-its-first-ever-audit-official-says-idUSKCN1NK2MC.</p>
      <p>Defense officials and outside experts have said it may be years before the Defense Department is able to fix its accounting gaps and errors and pass an audit.</p>
      <p>Norquist said that the Pentagon will not pass their audit until all of the 24 audited entities get a clean audit, but "within five or so years, I would expect you'd see a majority of them with a clean (audit) opinion."</p>
      <p>Through a series of site visits https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-pentagon-audit/pentagon-gets-failing-grade-in-its-second-audit-idUSKBN1XQ01D and samples, 1,400 auditors tested the systems and record-keeping processes on weapons systems, military personnel and property at some 600 sites around the world, completing 24 standalone audits, as well as the overall audit.</p>
      <p>Norquist told the Senate Armed Services Committee, "to do this work, the auditors went through billions of transactions, pulled samples, and then tested them for accuracy and completeness."</p>
