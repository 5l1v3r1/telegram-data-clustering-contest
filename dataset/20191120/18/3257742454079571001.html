      <p>A new third beta of macOS Catalina 10.15.2 is now available to developers as an over the air updated for devices enrolled in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Center</a>. While not yet available, a public beta update will be issued shortly for users participating in the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple Beta Software Program</a>.<br/><br/>This third beta comes after the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/13/second-macos-10152-beta-build-released-to-developers">second one was released</a> on November 13. Apple's developer notes for that release reported that the chief update was to specific networking issues. Apple added the key website top-level domains .dev and .app to its implementation of the HTTP Strict Transport Security system to help safe browsing.<br/><br/>The <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/apple-releases-first-beta-for-macos-catalina-10152">prior first beta</a>, released November 7, had more updates including additional <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/eGPU">eGPU</a> support, improvements to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Photos">Photos</a>, and a fix for an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple+Pay">Apple Pay</a> bug.<br/><br/>At this stage, it is unknown what changes Apple has made in this third beta. <br/><br/>Both <i>AppleInsider</i> and Apple itself <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/04/dont-run-the-ios-12-macos-1014-mojave-betas-if-you-value-your-data">strongly recommend</a> users don't install the betas on to "mission-critical" or primary devices, as there is the remote possibility of data loss or other issues. Instead, testers should install betas onto secondary or non-essential devices, and to make sure there are sufficient backups of important data before updating.<br/><br/><i>Find any changes in the new betas?
