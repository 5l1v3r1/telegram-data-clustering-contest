      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Bystanders on the Bentinck Street in Kolkata were showered with bundles of crisps currency notes on Wednesday afternoon when the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials were conducting a search at a private office in the cityâ€™s central business district.</p>
      <p>In a video that surfaced on the internet, dozens of notes of denomination of Rs 100, Rs 500 and even Rs 2000, were seen thrown out of the window of the sixth-floor of the building, from the office of Hoque Merchantile Pvt Ltd.</p>

      <p>It is being alleged that the sum of notes dumped on the road amounts to over Rs 3 lakh.</p>
      <p>Officials of the DRI told news agency PTI that they were conducting a raid at the office of the import-export company for alleged evasion of duty. They said that when the team arrived for search, the office was locked from inside.</p>
      <p>However, it is still being investigated whether there was a relation between the search operations and the shower of currency notes on the street below, PTI sources stated.</p>
      <p>The police are conducting further investigation in the matter.</p>
