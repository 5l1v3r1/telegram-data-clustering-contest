      <p>Cracks of dawn have started to appear over the political horizon of Maharashtra as the state stuck in a stalemate for past 27 days may finally see the formation of a government within a week.</p>
      <p>Sources in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have told India Today TV that interim Congress chief Sonia Gandhi has given green signal to an alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra. The leaders of the two parties also held a meeting at NCP leader Sharad Pawar's residence in New Delhi to hammer out a common minimum programme for the alliance.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra, which is currently reeling under a major farmers' crisis due to recent floods, has been left in limbo as the political parties play a game of chess and decide who gets to be the king and for how long.</p>
      <p>On October 24, when the results of Maharashtra Assembly Election 2019 were announced, BJP had emerged as the single-largest party with 105 seats in its kitty. It's pre-poll alliance partner Shiv Sena had scored 56 seats. Together, the alliance partners had a comfortable majority to form the government. But, the friendship which was mended with many efforts before Lok Sabha elections, fell off again as Shiv Sena alleged that the BJP has backed out on its promise of a rotational CM.</p>
      <p>As the BJP and Shiv Sena continued to play a game of chicken to see who will compromise first, the time to form the government ran out. On November 12, President's Rule was implemented for six months, with condition that it can be withdrawn if any party or alliance stakes a claim to the power.</p>
      <p>Hefty parleys have been underway since. Shiv Sena has turned to NCP (54) and Congress (44) to form the government. And after a series of meetings between mid-level leaders and party chiefs, a break is in the sight.</p>
      <p>With Sonia Gandhi giving her consent and common minimum programme at its final stages, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan have expressed confidence that the alliance will claim a stake at the Maharashtra government within a week.</p>
      <p>"The work of forming a government [in Maharashtra] has started from today. A government will be formed in the coming four to five days," Sanjay Raut told media. Prithviraj Chavan, though, added that some aspects of the likely alliance are still being discussed.</p>
      <p>"We had a long and positive discussion... We are confident that we will soon be able to give a stable government in Maharashtra," he said.</p>
      <p>A senior NCP leader told PTI that the government is likely to be formed before the first phase of the Jharkhand polls scheduled on November 30.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rotational CMs</b>
      </p>
      <p>NCP sources said the chief minister's post is most likely to be on a rotational basis, with the first half to be given to the Shiv Sena and the latter half to the Nationalist Congress Party, PTI reported.</p>
      <p>The Congress is likely to have the deputy chief minister's post for the full five-year term, they said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Marathon meetings</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena leaders have been holding marathon meetings to reach a consensus on power-sharing formula and Common Minimum Programme. On Wednesday, Congress leaders Ahmed Patel and Malikrjun Kharge met Sonia Gandhi at her residence at 10 Janpath in New Delhi. After a long meeting, Patel and Kharge moved four doors down to 6 Janpath - at NCP MP Supriya Sule's residence - a defacto NCP office in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>After the almost four-hour-long meeting, the leaders came out looking confident of forming a government in Maharashtra soon.</p>

      <p>Next up, more meetings. According to sources, Congress and NCP leaders will hold separate meetings on Thursday before meeting for another round of negotiations later in the day. On Friday, they will go to Mumbai, where they will meet Shiv Sena leaders.</p>
      <p>All three parties are likely to hold a joint press conference on Friday.</p>
