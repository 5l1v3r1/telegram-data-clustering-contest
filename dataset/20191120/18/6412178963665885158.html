        <b>Two Italian clubs are thought to be considering making a move for Arsenal outcast Granit Xhaka in the January transfer window.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder, who has not played for the <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/arsenal">Gunners</a></b> since October 27 after being jeered from the field against Crystal Palace, is thought to have <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/unai-emery-hints-that-granit-xhakas-time-at-arsenal-is-up"><b>played his last game for Unai Emery’s side</b></a> and looks set to leave when the market re-opens.</p>
      <p>Now reports from <i>Sky Germany</i>, cited by <i><b><a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146668/milan-and-inter-xhaka">Football Italia</a></b>,</i> suggest that both Milan clubs could be about to try and tempt the 27-year-old to the San Siro.</p>
      <p>The report suggests that Inter boss Antonio Conte sees Xhaka as a good option to strengthen his squad’s depth, while AC Milan are thought to be keen on adding his experience to what is a young team.</p>
      <p>It also adds that both AC and Inter would initially take him on a loan-deal with an option to buy, while also ruling out a return Borussia Monchengladbach – who Xhaka left to join Arsenal back in 2016.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/unai-emery-hints-that-granit-xhakas-time-at-arsenal-is-up"><b> fellow Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira could also be on his way out of the Emirates after his agent confirmed he was unhappy at the club.</b></a></p>
