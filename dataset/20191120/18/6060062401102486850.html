      <p>A Washington Post photo is gaining traction on social media for capturing the drama of President Donald Trump's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">impeachment hearings.</a></p>
      <p>The photo shows Ambassador Gordon Sondland smirking at the camera, as a sea of photojournalists angle for a shot behind him.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user compared it to famous photo of President Donald Trump, smiling to himself during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

      <p>Others came up with captions for the photo, imagining what Sondland was thinking to himself when the picture was taken.</p>
      <p>"You're probably wondering why I paid a million dollars to be here," The Daily Show tweeted, referencing the idea that Sondland "bought" his ambassadorship.</p>
