      <h2>West Bromwich Albion latest | Fans are unhappy as flop midfielder Oliver Burke admits he wants out of the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/tom-leach/</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion midfielder <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/oliver-burke">Oliver Burke</a> hopes his performances for loan club Alaves will put him back in the shop window for a move away from <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/the-hawthorns">the Hawthorns</a> - and Baggies fans are far from impressed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-brom-oliver-burke-celtic-17256840">with his take</a>.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old, who joined <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion</a> for a record-breaking fee of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-brom-tony-pulis-swooped-13527707">£15m in 2017</a> has only made 20 league appearances in blue and white and spent most of his time  away on loan.</p>
      <p>After a spell with Celtic last term he joined Alaves in the hope of getting more game time, and he revealed this week he hopes strong performances in Spain can earn him a January transfer move.</p>
      <p>“I just have to focus on this loan I’m on now and take it all in, and hopefully good things come from me going on loan now and getting game time," said Burke.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it puts me in the shop window. I’d love to be at a club and be the first name on the team-sheet every week, but I think it will come in time.</p>

      <p>“I’m still at a good age and I’m just doing everything I can to learn the game.”</p>
      <p>His words have not left Albion supporters best pleased They were expecting more from the highly rated youngster when he first arrived in West Bromwich. This is what they have been saying...</p>
      <p><b>Adam Bunce:</b> Nothing personal against Burke, but he hasn't been good enough for us and considering he's our record signing I hope he can look at his own performances and think: 'I haven't been good enough'. We are wasting money on him paying his wages. One of the worst players I've seen pull on a blue and white shirt. We obviously don't need him.</p>
      <p><b>Dave Harrel:</b> How the hell were we conned into paying so much for him?</p>
      <p><b>Shaun Butler:</b> Playing well puts you in the window.</p>

      <p><b>Harry Green:</b> I don't blame him, I reckon he needs to leave the club so he can get back playing again as I just don't see where he'd fit in.</p>
      <p><b>Brian Watson:</b> Be glad when he's gone!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Steven Ashford:</b> I think he thought that WBA were nothing and thought: 'I will get into that team easy and the big teams will want me then'. How wrong, and what a Big Burke thinking that.</p>
      <p><b>Matt Lawley:</b> Bags of ability yet no football brain, to play under so many managers already and they have all failed to get anything out of him proves he will never make it as a top player.</p>
