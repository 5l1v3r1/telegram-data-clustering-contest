      <h1>Jose Mourinho will take no 's***' - Dimitar Berbatov tells Tottenham stars what to expect</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho signed a three-and-a-half-year contract to become Tottenham manager less than 12 hours after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:20:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Former Premier League star Dimitar Berbatov has backed Jose Mourinho to bring success to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> - as he will not accept any "s***" from his new players.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss, who had been out of work since leaving the latter last December, signed a three-and-a-half-year contract less than 12 hours after Mauricio Pochettino was sensationally sacked.</p>
      <p>Despite his troubles in the latter stages of his tenure at Old Trafford, Mourinho remains one of the most sought-after managers in the game.</p>
      <p>His success at delivering trophies is not in question, having won three Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and a host of domestic cups, and that was a clear attraction for Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>

      <p>And Berbatov, the ex-Bulgarian star who played for both Spurs and United, has backed the decision to replace fans' favourite Pochettino with Mourinho.</p>
      <p>"With his resume and the amount of trophies he has won in the Champions League, Premier League and wherever he goes, he as earned the right to take no s***," he told BetFair.</p>
      <p>"If you show him respect he will give you respect back, and he deserves that because he has proven himself by winning so much.</p>

      <p>"The players will want to show him how they can play and they will be thinking that they need to prove themselves to him.</p>
      <p>"He will bring new ideas, a new way of playing, new exercises in training and the players will need to show themselves, all of them.</p>
      <p>"In every club you have that player hierarchy, you know that you are good, maybe you are the captain of the team and you know you are going to play, but at the same time that doesn't give you the right to just lay back and play off your name, you need to work hard and this will be the case with Mourinho."</p>
