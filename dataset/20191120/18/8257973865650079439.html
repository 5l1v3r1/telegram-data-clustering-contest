      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Shinzo_Abe/?tps=1">Shinzo Abe</a> became the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history on Wednesday, but his record-breaking tenure is being overshadowed by a new political scandal.</p>
      <p>Abe, 65, who began his second term as prime minister in 2012, is being accused of using a publicly funded cherry blossom viewing party as an election campaign event, according to the Asahi Shimbun and other Japanese news services.</p>
      <p>Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Wednesday among the 15,000 guests invited to the event, 1,000 people were "recommended" by Abe, while another 1,000 people were from a list provided by other Abe administration officials. A total of 6,000 supporters or affiliates of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were invited, possibly to rally support for Abe's election in July, the Asahi reported.</p>
      <p>The disclosure came after Abe told a Tokyo budget committee he "was not involved" in the selection of invitees to the event, where Japanese celebrities and athletes are featured as guests.</p>
      <p>Jun Azumi, deputy secretary-general of the center-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, has said the incident is "ironic," as well as "extremely regrettable."</p>
      <p>Abe has been in office for 2,887 days, owing to effective campaigning, perceptions his economic policies are working and his steady appeal among right-wing supporters.</p>
      <p>Support for Abe has enabled his political career to overcome other corruption allegations, including an illicit land sale in 2016 to a school foundation with links to first lady Akie Abe.</p>
      <p>Abe's name was cleared in 2018, after Nobuhisa Sagawa, director-general of the financial bureau of the finance ministry at the time of the land sale, said he was the chief agent responsible for falsified documents.</p>
      <p>The flower-viewing scandal and other incidents involving political appointees have taken a toll on Abe's approval rating, however. Abe's rating dropped by 6 percentage points from a month ago, to 49 percent, according to a poll conducted by Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.</p>
