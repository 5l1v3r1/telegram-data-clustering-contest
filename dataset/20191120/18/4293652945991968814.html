      <p>The NHLPA has filed a grievance challenging <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/dustin-byfuglien/296054">Dustin Byfuglien</a>’s suspension by the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/teams/winnipeg-jets/">Winnipeg Jets</a>, according to <i>Sportsnet’s</i> Elliotte Friedman.</p>

      <p>The veteran defenceman was suspended by the team for failing to report to training camp.</p>
      <p>Friedman reported earlier this month that the situation between the Jets and Byfuglien could end up in arbitration. The Jets said that the 34-year-old was deemed fit to play after his 2018-19 season-ending physical, he didn’t indicate he was dealing with an ankle injury during the summer and made it clear at the beginning of the year he was ready to retire.</p>
      <p>But it was announced at the end of October that Byfuglien underwent surgery for a high-ankle sprain and will not be available to play until the new year, at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Byfuglien is in the second-last season of a five-year, $38-million contract with the Jets. He is scheduled to earn $8 million this season and $6 million next, but due to his suspension by the team, he hasn’t collected any of his salary.</p>
