        <b>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in talks over a return to AC Milan but a deal is still a long way off, according to Sky in Italy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He played for the club between 2010 and 2012 and is looking for a new club after announcing his <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12096/11860640/zlatan-ibrahimovic-leaves-la-galaxy-but-the-story-continues">departure from LA Galaxy</a> earlier this month.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Milan officials met with Ibrahimovic's agent Mino Raiola on Wednesday and the encounter was said to be cordial.</p>
      <p>Sky in Italy say there are hurdles to overcome before Ibrahimovic can return to Serie A, though, and that compromises will need to be made on both sides.</p>
      <p>Milan are understood to be willing to offer the 38-year-old an 18-month deal but his wage expectations are believed to be an issue, with the club currently serving a ban from European competition due to Financial Fair Play breaches.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic, who scored 53 goals in 58 games during his two years with the Galaxy, will decide on his future in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>He scored 56 goals in 85 games during his time with Milan and helped them to the Serie A title in 2011.</p>
