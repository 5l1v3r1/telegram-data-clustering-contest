      <p>U.S. equities are backing away from their recent highs as investors worry about worsening U.S.-China trade tensions after the U.S. Senate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/world/asia/senate-bill-hong-kong-protests.html">passed a bill</a> critical of Beijing’s handling of the protests in Hong Kong. China doesn’t like anyone to be critical of their security apparatus, and is threatening a worst-case scenario if Washington persists.</p>
      <p>Of course, a daily drip of positive trade headlines has largely been responsible for the market’s run to new records. This threatens to undermine the bullish narrative just days after the <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> bagged 28,000 for the first time.</p>
      <p>Here are four Dow component stocks to sell that are weakening badly:</p>
      <h3>Caterpillar (CAT)</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The first of our Dow stocks to sell is <b>Caterpillar</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cat-stock-quote/"><b><u>CAT</u></b></a>). Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar have crossed down below their 20-day moving average for the first time since early October after testing overhead support near the high set last September. This sets up a likely retest of the double-bottom lows near $115 — which would be worth a loss of nearly 20% from here.</p>
      <p>The company will next report results on Jan. 28 before the bell. Analysts are looking for earnings of $2.40 per share on revenues of $13.5 billion.</p>
      <h3>Chevron (CVX)</h3>

      <p>Energy majors like <b>Chevron</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cvx-stock-quote/"><b><u>CVX</u></b></a>) have been under renewed pressure this week as the sector overall remains in a three-year holding pattern. Crude oil prices have been stuck in the $50-a-barrel range since 2015, as U.S. shale supply is keeping the market well fed despite ongoing tensions in the Middle East. Worries of a global economic downturn are weighing on demand projections as well.</p>
      <p>The stock does offer a nice dividend yield of more than 4%, but prices are likely to return to the early October low for a loss of nearly 6% from here.</p>
      <h3>Home Depot (HD)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hd-3.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A post-earnings stumble sent shares of <b>Home Depot</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hd-stock-quote/"><b><u>HD</u></b></a>) stumbling lower amid worries that all is not well for the U.S. housing market. Same-store sales growth of 3.6% missed analyst expectations of 4.7% badly while gross margins contracted.</p>
      <p>Diluted earnings per share grew just 0.80% from the prior year, which is basically nothing for a stock that trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple of roughly 22 times. And what’s worse, management cut its forward guidance.</p>
      <h3>McDonald’s (MCD)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mcd-2.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p><b>McDonald’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mcd-stock-quote/"><b><u>MCD</u></b></a>) shares are in a pennant pattern that looks ready to resolve to the downside amid ongoing competitive pressures and a loss of its CEO after a relationship with a colleague was revealed. The stock is back under its 200-day moving average and looks set for a return to the summer 2018 trading range near $160, which would be worth a loss of roughly 20% from here.</p>
      <p>Piper Jaffray research analysts downgraded the stock in the wake of its CEO departure, noting that it will take time for the company to regain leadership momentum.</p>
