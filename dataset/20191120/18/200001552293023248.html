      <h1>Mourinho considering signing 2 Lille players – Interesting claim from France on Tottenham business</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:46:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Lille have been rather accommodating with Tottenham Hotspur today. Announcing they’d reached an agreement to allow Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos to leave and join Jose Mourinho’s backroom team, there was no hint of annoyance over the situation.</p>
      <p>The pair were wished well and sent on their way, likely for some compensation from Spurs.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been spending time at Lille this season, going to watch matches and hanging around the place. He has a relationship with transfer guru Luis Campos, who advises Lille’s president and used to help Jose at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Sacramento and Santos will surely have come up in conversation before this week, and it’s quite possible they may not be the only ones swapping Lille for London.</p>
      <p>Campos being brought in as an adviser is a rumour which writes itself, and now there’s a claim from France about two players who could also move.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.jeunesfooteux.com/LOSC-Mercato-enorme-coup-dur-pour-Lille-et-Galtier-_a39165.html">Jeunes Footeux</a>, who aren’t usually ones for sensational claims, report Mourinho is considering signing two Lille players: Victor Osimhen and Boubakary Soumaré</p>
      <p>Osminhen is a 20 year old attacker and has scored nine goals in 17 matches so far this season. He’s been playing as a centre forward, but can also go wide if needed.</p>
      <p>Soumaré, also 20, is a defensive leaning midfielder and has 16 appearances this season.</p>
      <p>Jeunes Footeux say the claims are according to rumours, yet it hasn’t been reported elsewhere so perhaps they mean rumours around the French club.</p>
      <p>The article ends by saying it wouldn’t be a surprise if Tottenham submit a ‘huge offer’ for the pair.</p>
