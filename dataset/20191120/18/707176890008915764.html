      <p>Labour has drawn up plans for a windfall tax on the oil industry as part of its attempt to shift the UK towards a low-carbon, green economy, prompting anger from some union officials.</p>
      <p>Senior figures inside the opposition party said the idea was very likely to feature in its election manifesto, due to be announced on Thursday in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>The idea also triggered concern from Richard Leonard, Labour’s leader in Scotland — where the oil industry is a large employer.</p>
      <p>One Labour official said Mr Leonard’s “face was ashen when this came up”, given the potential impact on Scottish voters. Unite the Union’s largest branch in Scotland is in the offshore oil and gas industry. Mr Leonard refused to comment.</p>
      <p>“This could cause an entire industry, with huge economic importance, to up sticks and leave the North Sea,” said one internal critic. “The country will then continue to use as much oil and gas as we would have, but now we will import it: fewer jobs, poorer economy, worse balance of payments and zero difference to climate change.”</p>
      <p>Another Labour official said the plan featured as a single line in the draft manifesto discussed at the “Clause V” meeting last Saturday where the 139-page document was finalised. It was “85 per cent certain” to feature in the final version, he said.</p>
      <p>John McDonnell, shadow chancellor, was asked at an event on Tuesday whether there would be an oil tax in the manifesto and whether he could explain how it would work. “No and no,” he replied.</p>
      <p>An official later tried to backtrack on Mr McDonnell’s comments, saying that he had not denied the policy would be in the party’s official programme for the December 12 poll. “He has not discussed what will or won’t be in the manifesto,” the official said.</p>
      <p>The situation is <a href="https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/politics/holyrood/1627367/shadow-chancellor-pledges-to-support-oil-and-gas/">awkward for the shadow chancellor</a> because a year ago, during a visit to Scotland, he promised to do “everything we can to support the industry” in terms of a tax regime for oil companies.</p>
      <p>The initiative comes as Mr Corbyn will promise to invest £250bn of borrowed money into a “green transformation fund” which will finance initiatives such as £70bn of loans for people to buy electric cars, huge investment in state-controlled offshore wind farms and over 300,000 new “green apprenticeships”.</p>

      <p>The row over the new oil tax comes as a separate battle rages over the wording around a new 2030 target for the UK to become carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>While the 2030 “zero carbon” target will appear in the manifesto, the party has watered down the language, pledging to achieve “substantial progress” rather than “overwhelming progress”.</p>
      <p>That followed an intervention by unions, including the GMB, NUM and Community, which warned that the target was impossible to meet within a decade given the need to rip out 26m household gas boilers and replace the entire transport system with low-carbon alternatives.</p>
      <p>Separately, the Labour manifesto will pledge to transform the CDC, the UK’s development finance institution into a new “green development bank”.</p>
      <p>The CDC is the overseas private equity arm of the Department for International Development and receives generous aid funding every year. Dan Carden, shadow development secretary, said Labour would revamp the organisation so that it ensured “climate justice” by ensuring all of its investments were aligned to the Paris climate agreement.</p>
      <p>That would mean an end to investing in fossil fuel industries, private equity funds or private healthcare or education companies, he said.</p>
