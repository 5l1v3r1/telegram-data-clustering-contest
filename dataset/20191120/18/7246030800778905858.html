      <h1>Israeli Elections 3.0 in the Wings?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:29:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>Government minister Ze’ev Elkin said Wednesday in an interview with Israel’s Kann public broadcasting network that the Blue and White party is not “prepared” to allow Benjamin Netanyahu to take a position as prime minister regardless of where in the rotation it might be scheduled.</p>
      <p>“In Blue and White, they said they were not prepared for Netanyahu to be prime minister after [Benny] Gantz,” said Elkin, who is a member of the negotiating team for Netanyahu’s Likud party.</p>
      <p>“In their opinion, Netanyahu can neither be first, nor second,” Elkin elaborated.</p>
      <p>Blue and White party chairman Benny Gantz is scheduled to deliver an address on the current stalemate Wednesday evening at Expo Tel Aviv.</p>
