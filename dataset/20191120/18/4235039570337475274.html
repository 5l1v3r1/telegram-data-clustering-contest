      <p>The <b>construction</b> of the first 8 <b>stations</b> from the third <b>metro line</b> of <b>Sofia</b> will be completed in December, the director of Metropoliten Stoyan Bratoev announced, Trud bg writes. The 8 km route starts from Vladimir Vazov Blvd and will pass through Eagle Bridge, National Palace of Culture and Bulgaria Blvd, reaching Krasno Selo. The <b>stations</b> will be commissioned in the next few months.</p>
      <p>"We are at the final stage, there is still a little bit left. By the end of the year, the tests may not be able to finish, but we have to finish <b>construction</b> in December," Bratoev said. The municipality purchased 20 of the vehicles for the line, and subsequently ordered 10 more. The modern trains can be operated without a driver, but this option won't be used. </p>
      <p>"In 2020, <b>Sofia</b> will have a 52 km subway that will serve 500,000 passengers a day." Mayor Yordanka Fandakova said. </p>
