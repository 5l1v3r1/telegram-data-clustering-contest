      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:55:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/ghbase2/" target="_blank">Ghbase New Writer</a></address>
      <p>Before you dismiss this report as false, let me take my time to explain why you should not do so in a hurry.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/just-inburna-boy-gets-grammy-award-nomination/">The nominees for the 2020 Grammy Awards were announced earlier this morning</a></b> on CBS by president/CEO Deborah Dugan and Academy Chair of the Board of Trustees and producer Harvey Mason Jr., along with host Alicia Keys and Bebe Rexha.</p>
      <p>Beyoncé’s Lion King album gained four nominations in different categories and since Shatta Wale contributed to the album on the song ‘Already’, he’s technically in line for consideration.</p>
      <p>This also means if Queen Bey wins the award, all the artists she featured which includes Shatta Wale are winners too.</p>
      <p>The Lion King: The Gift album was nominated in <b>Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media &amp; Best Song Written For Visual Media.</b></p>
      <p>An overly excited Shatta Wale who is also aware of the information espoused above expressed his excitement in a tweet.</p>
      <p>He wrote:<b> At long last my name has entered <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GRAMMYs?src=hashtag_click">#GRAMMYs</a> ,thanks to the Beehive team !!!! Patience is truly the key !!! Pah pah pah pah</b></p>

      <p>He added: “<b>If Beyonce win ago celebrate ruff , haters go bore ruff ..….</b></p>
