      <p>The Dallas Zoo is welcoming two new residents.</p>
      <p>Two white-cheeked gibbons named Daxin and Tualang came to the Dallas Zoo based on a breeding recommendation from The Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan. Gibbons are critically endangered, and the plan aims to ensure the long-term survival of the species. </p>

      <p>White-cheeked gibbons like Daxin and Tualang are primates native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. Gibbons are the most bipedal of all non-human primates, which means that they often walk on two feet.</p>
      <p>Visitors at the Dallas Zoo can see the new gibbons at Primate Place enclosure. </p>
