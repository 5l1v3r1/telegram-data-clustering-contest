      <p>A Liam Gallagher fan is said to have been left ‘scarred for life’ after she was burned by a flare at the Madchester star’s concert.</p>
      <p>On 18 November, Leon Andrew attended the singer’s gig with his sister Stacey, at the Sheffield venue, Fly DSA Arena.</p>
      <p>However, partway through the set, the siblings claim to have been hit by a flare – which the 21-year-old says ‘seriously burned’ his sister.</p>
      <p>Taking to Facebook, he shared a status with a Liam Gallagher fan group where he tried to track down the punter who originally lit the flare.</p>
      <p>Leon wrote: ‘Anyone who has information on the scumbag who decided to light a flare and throw it into the crowd and set my sister on fire I want his name or information on him because he needs to pay for what he has done.</p>

      <p>‘You could have taken my sister away from me and my family tonight.’</p>

      <p>He explained how the flare ‘seriously burnt her body and set fire to her clothes’ before adding: ‘I want justice for the pain they have caused my sister because she will now have scars for the rest of her life.’</p>
      <p>In a statement issued to Metro.co.uk, a spokesperson from South Yorkshire Police said: ‘We are aware of an incident that occurred at on Monday 18 November at the Fly DSA Arena on Broughton Lane, Sheffield.</p>
      <p>‘It is reported that a 21-year-old man and a woman he was with, whose age is not known, were in the audience of a concert and were allegedly hit by a flare that was thrown from behind them.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘They both suffered burns and received treatment at the Northern General Hospital before returning home to recover.</p>

      <p>‘Arrangements will be made for both injured parties to be interviewed but as they live outside of our force area we can’t say when this will be.’</p>
      <p>Dominic Stokes of the Fly DSA Arena has also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-50490458">commented on the incident, and told The BBC</a>: ‘The irresponsible behaviour of the concert-goer who threw the flare along with any other people within their party who were aware of the possibility of their actions cannot be condoned and they should be held accountable for their actions.’</p>
