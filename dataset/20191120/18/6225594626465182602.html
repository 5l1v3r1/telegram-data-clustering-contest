        <b>Google Earth is adding content creation tools to its platform that allow any user to create maps and stories and share them with family and friends.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Remember Google Earth? While the platform isnâ€™t the most talked about, it remains one amazing tool that is about to become even more. With the addition of content creation tools that allow users to create maps and stories around them, Google Earth is becoming an important destination for all of us who want to discover and share new places.</p>
      <p>The tools allow to combine text and imagery on Google Earth maps, including Street View and 360-degree videos. It is meant to help create new experiences that immerse viewers in real places they can explore and learn more about.</p>
      <p>The feature is an expansion of the Voyager program that Google launched in 2017. Back then, it was only open to top storytellers, scientists, and nonprofits.</p>
