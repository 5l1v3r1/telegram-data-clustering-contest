      <p>Smartwatches have come a long way since the bulky strap-on devices of just a few years ago, and just like our phones they’ve begun to take on more and more useful functions as the underlying technology improves.</p>
      <p>Wearables have merged with fitness trackers, and have heroically untethered themselves from our phones by incorporating their very own GPS and storage, becoming lighter, thinner and more fashionable along the way.</p>
      <p>So where do you start? Here’s our pick of the best smartwatches and wearables of 2019.</p>

      <p><b>From £399, <a href="http://apple.com/uk">apple.com</a><br/></b>Apple does not do things by halves, so when it released its first Apple Watch in 2015 it was little surprise that it was the best all-round smartwatch on the market. The Apple Watch 5 is still the best out there ­­– sleek, stylish and syncing perfectly with your iPhone. It now comes with an always-on display that adjusts to the ambient light and more storage to hold all your running tunes.</p>
