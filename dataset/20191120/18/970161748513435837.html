      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>’s Caitlyn Jenner has reportedly been ‘banned’ from spilling any family secrets about the Kardashians during her time in the jungle – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-begins-spilling-family-secrets-opens-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-11185599/">despite talking about Kim in last night’s episode.</a></p>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the former Olympian spoke candidly about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> not going to university and how she set up her first company, as well as her relationship with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>.</p>
      <p>Talking about how Kim got the business bug, Caitlyn recalled: ‘Kimberly never went to college. The minute she left high school she started businesses. She had her first business out of the closet.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘Kimberly would go into the ladies’ closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet – they’re huge. Beverly Hills ladies.</p>
      <p>‘They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberly has an eBay site… Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission.’</p>

      <p>However according to former campmate Nicola Mclean, Caitlyn won’t be able to reveal any good family gossip throughout I’m A Celeb due to ‘legal reasons’.</p>

      <p>Nicola, who was a campmate in the jungle in 2008, also thinks legal issues could stop Nadine Coyle from talking about her time in Girls Aloud.</p>

      <p>She told Closer magazine: ‘As much as we’re hoping for exciting Kardashian or Cheryl gossip, it might not be the case, because lawyers watch each episode before it airs to make sure the people campmates are talking about aren’t defamed.</p>
      <p>‘I was in Celebrity Big Brother with Ray J – Kim’s ex, with whom she did the sex tape – and he told us loads of stuff, but it never aired because of legal reasons.’</p>

      <p>Kris Jenner has also reportedly been worried about how much Caitlyn will say about the Kardashian/Jenner family</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/">we’re desperate to know all the family’s tea</a>, such as if the campmate has beef with Khloe Kardashian and whether or not Drake is dating Kylie, the momager is secretly panicking that her ex’s time in the jungle could spell disaster.</p>
      <p>‘Ever since Kris found out about Caitlyn’s massive fee she’s getting paid for the jungle, she’s been concerned Caitlyn is being paid to spill secrets about the family,’ a source revealed.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Kris doesn’t care what Caitlyn says about her or their marriage – after all, she had her book and her TV show – but she’s scared and horrified about Caitlyn damaging Kim or Kylie’s brands by telling campmates about their off-screen private lives.’</p>
      <p>The insider added to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10369188/kris-jenner-scared-caitlyn-spillfamily-secrets/">The Sun</a> that Kris fears that Caitlyn will ‘talk about how awful her life married into the Kardashian family’ to gain ‘sympathy’ after clashing with fellow campmates.</p>
