      <p>The second match on Thursday pits <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/karnataka-tuskers">Karnataka Tuskers</a> against Qalandars in Match 20 of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/t10-cricket-league">Abu Dhabi T10 League 2019</a>. Both teams are desperately in need of a win in this game. Both teams have three points to their names and will be eliminated if they fail to get the points in this game.</p>
      <p>Although both sides look evenly matched on paper, Karnataka Tuskers have been more impressive with Hashim Amla and Johnson Charles in very good form. Nevertheless, a high-octane do-or-die clash is set to kickstart a series of eliminations in the tournament with Karnataka Tuskers and Qalandars looking to live another day. Here are a few tips to help you pick your Dream11 team.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Squads to choose from:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Karnataka Tuskers:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hashim Amla(C), Evin Lewis, Johnson Charles, Ross Whiteley, Ryan Ten Doeschate, Kesrick Williams, Fabian Allen, Marlon Samuels, Ahmed Raza, Shafiqullah Shafiq, Sandeep Lamichhane, Pat Brown, Shapoor Zadran, Nathan Rimmington and Asad Pathan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Qalandars:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dawid Malan(C), Tom Banton, Luke Ronchi, Philip Salt, Laurie Evans, Jordan Clark, Chris Jordan, Seekuge Prasanna, Samit Patel, Lahiru Kumara, George Garton, Sultan Ahmed, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Hassan Khalid.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Playing XI Updates:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Karnataka Tuskers:</b>
      </p>
      <p>With their previous game being washed out, no changes are expected from the Tuskers. Their opening duo of Evin Lewis and Johnson Charles is one of the most explosive ones in the tournament and will be key along with the captain, Hashim Amla. They have a lot of experience in the bowling unit with Nathan Rimmington and Kesrick Williams expected to work in tandem. Sandeep Lamichhane is one to watch out for with his leg-spin.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: Lewis, Charles, Amla(C), Whiteley, ten Doeschate, Shafiq (WK), Raza, Williams, Rimmington, Lamichhane and Shapoor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Qalandars:</b>
      </p>
      <p>With this being a must-win game for the Qalandars, they should field their strongest side for this game. Tom Banton and Dawid Malan have impressed but are yet to fire in unison. Along with Luke Ronchi, their hopes of qualification depend upon them. They have a long batting unit as well with Chris Jordan and Seekuge Prasanna batting at six and seven. The addition of Mujeeb ur Rahman should rejuvenate their bowling unit which seems to be heavily dependant on Chris Jordan at the moment.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: Banton, Ronchi (WK), Malan(C), Salt, Sultan Ahmed, Jordan, Mujeeb, Garton, Prasanna, Kumara, Clark</p>

        <b>Match Details:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Karnataka Tuskers vs Qalandars, Match 20</p>
      <p>21st November 2019, 7:15 PM IST</p>
      <p>Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Pitch Report:</b>
      </p>
      <p>A decent batting track awaits the two sides with 100 being a bare minimum here. Although the dimensions of the ground are relatively bigger, teams should be able to make good use of the pitch. There isn't much swing on offer for the pacers with off pace deliveries being key</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Fantasy Tips and Suggestions:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Wicket-keeper:</b> Both Luke Ronchi and Johnson Charles are preferred for this game with both of them due for some runs at the top of the order. While Charles has scored 105 runs so far, Ronchi is yet to fire and will hope to do so in this game.</p>
      <p><b>Batsmen:</b> Evin Lewis had a decent start to T10 League 2019 although he is capable of scoring more than what he managed against the Deccan Gladiators. While he is one player to have in the side, Tom Banton and Dawid Malan should also find a place in the side. Both of them have scored a fifty each so far and will look to fire in this crucial game. As for the final option, one of Hashim Amla or Ross Whiteley should also suffice</p>
      <p><b>Allrounders:</b> Jordan Clark is a handy player to have in the fantasy side with the Surrey allrounder chipping in with a wicket or two along with useful runs in the death overs. Along with the Qalandars all-rounder, Nathan Rimmington should get the nod over Ahmed Raza, although the UAE all-rounder has also impressed with five wickets in four games so far.</p>
      <p><b>Bowlers: </b>Chris Jordan is one of the best death bowlers in the competition and should find a place in most fantasy teams. He is also capable of scoring vital runs in the back end which makes him a handy option. While one of Mujeeb or Kumara would also do, all eyes will be upon Sandeep Lamichhane, who is Karnataka Tuskers' best bet with the ball. Along with the aforementioned trio, the likes of Kesrick Williams and Shapoor Zadran would also fit the bill for this game.</p>
      <p><b>Captain:</b> Evin Lewis is in very good touch with the former Mumbai Indians opener scoring a fifty against Afghanistan in the recently concluded T20I series. While the south-paw takes up one multiplier option, the likes of Johnson Charles and Tom Banton would also be a safe bet to score some runs on Thursday.</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #1:</b> Luke Ronchi, Johnson Charles, Tom Banton, Dawid Malan, Evin Lewis, Jordan Clark, Ahmed Raza, Mujeeb ur Rahman, Chris Jordan, Sandeep Lamichhane and Kesrick Williams. Captain: Tom Banton, Vice-Captain: Evin Lewis</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #2:</b> Johnson Charles, Dawid Malan, Philip Salt, Tom Banton, Evin Lewis, Jordan Clark, Nathan Rimmington, Lahiru Kumara, Chris Jordan, Sandeep Lamichhane and Kesrick Williams. Captain: Johnson Charles, Vice-Captain: Tom Banton</p>
