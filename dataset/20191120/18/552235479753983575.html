      <h1>The truth on Alfredo Morelos and the Aston Villa transfer rumour that just won't go away</h1>
      <h2>Rangers have ruled out a January exit for their top scorer but that hasn't stopped speculation from the English media.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:51:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:51</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>If you've bashed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a>' name into Google any time over the last month then chances are you'll have seen it alongside the words " <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>".</p>
      <p>Amid the Rangers star's prolific goalscoring form he's been linked with a host of clubs both in England and across Europe.</p>
      <p>Eintracht Frankfurt, Saint-Etienne and Crystal Palace are just a selection.</p>
      <p>But the link to Villa has been especially prominent, so much so that boss Dean Smith was asked about it earlier after Morelos netted a stunner to beat Porto in the Europa League.</p>
      <p>In a play straight from page one of the manager's media handbook, Smith paid Morelos a compliment before remaining decidedly coy on a potential transfer.</p>
      <p>He said: "I certainly saw his goal last night.</p>

      <p>"It was a very good finish.</p>
      <p>"He's a player who is contracted to another football club and we aren't a club that talks about them."</p>
      <p>Smith refused to open the door on a transfer but he didn't exactly slam it shut either.</p>
      <p>However, <i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands the manager was simply being true to his word on not discussing other teams' players, and that there is no interest on Villa's part in the Colombian.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Morelos may well move on from Ibrox to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League</a>, but seemingly not to the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox favourite has bagged 22 club goals already this term, followed up with a maiden international strike last week as well.</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard has continually ruled out a January exit for the striker, with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> boss targeting a sustained Premiership title tilt and an extended run in Europe.</p>
      <p>He said earlier in November: "I'm not confident, I'm sure, I'm 100 per cent sure he's not going anywhere."</p>
