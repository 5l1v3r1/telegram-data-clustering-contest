      <h1>Disney+ Could Rocket to 60 Million Subscribers Sooner Than Expected</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:24:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>Disney+ gained 10 million subscribers on its first day and the service’s growth shows no sign of slowing down. <i>Variety </i>reported that it could hit its target of 60 million subscribers by 2022, two years earlier than its aiming for.</p>
      <blockquote>Expectations were already enormous ahead of the launch. Disney Plus was largely expected to accrue about 8 million users across the seven remaining weeks in calendar 2019 — but not 10 million in one day. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that at its current pace, Disney could hit its 2024 goal of 60 million to 90 million global streaming subscribers potentially two years earlier than targeted. That would mark admirably aggressive growth. For context, streaming market leader Netflix boasts more than 60 million subscribers in the U.S. and 158 million worldwide, a base built over the last 12 years or so. Ives’ estimates suggest Disney could get within spitting distance of a nine-figure subscriber base in just three years.</blockquote>
