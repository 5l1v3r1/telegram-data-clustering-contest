      <p>NEW YORK -- <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-capitals">Washington Capitals</a> forward <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3149633/garnet-hathaway">Garnet Hathaway</a> has been suspended three games for spitting on an opponent.</p>
      <p>The NHL announced Hathaway's suspension Wednesday after a hearing with him. He will forfeit $24,194 in salary.</p>
      <p>Toward the end of a heated brawl between the Capitals and Ducks on Monday night, Hathaway responded to a rabbit punch from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/5503/erik-gudbranson">Erik Gudbranson</a> by spitting on the Anaheim defenseman. Hathaway was ejected with a match penalty that carried with it an automatic suspension pending review by the league.</p>
      <p>Hathaway said he regretted spitting on Gudbranson and called it an emotional moment. He will miss Washington's games against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/nyr/new-york-rangers">New York Rangers</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/van/vancouver-canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/fla/florida-panthers">Florida Panthers</a>.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has been a strong addition to the Capitals, who signed him in July. With Washington in salary cap trouble because of injuries and the suspension, the team put winger <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/2300267/carl-hagelin">Carl Hagelin</a> on long-term injured reserve and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/player/_/id/3025616/nic-dowd">Nic Dowd</a> on injured reserve and recalled two minor league forwards to play Wednesday night at New York.</p>
