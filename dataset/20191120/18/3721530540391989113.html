      <p>The Toyota Supra — a street-racing icon that returned this July after a 17-year hiatus — comes to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/forza-horizon-4-2/40436"><i>Forza Horizon 4</i></a><i> </i>next month in a free title update. The model has been missing from several big-name racing video games since 2017’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/gran-turismo-sport/38742"><i>Gran Turismo Sport</i></a><i> </i>launched.</p>
      <p>Turn10’s official Forza Motorsport account yesterday tweeted out the news, saying the 1998 Toyota Supra RZ will be included in <i>Forza</i><i> Horizon 4</i>’s series 17 update on Dec. 12.</p>

      <p>This somewhat resolves a mini-flap over Toyota cars’ absence from anything other than on-track motorsports video games the past couple of years. In August, a <i>Need for Speed</i><i> Heat </i>fan <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/29510/toyota-backtracks-on-why-it-wont-license-cars-to-video-games-like-need-for-speed">tweeted at the car maker</a> after noticing the Supra was sitting out its second consecutive Need for Speed game.</p>
      <p>Toyota UK’s reply kicked up quite the fuss, saying their cars could be found in “<i>GT Sport, </i>which doesn’t promote illegal street racing.” That tweet was quickly deleted and walked back, with a statement that implied the company had an exclusive license with Polyphony Digital and <i>Gran Turismo</i><i> Sport</i>, and no plans to license its cars in other games at the moment.</p>
      <p>Since <i>Gran Turismo Sport </i>launched on PlayStation 4 in 2017, Toyota trucks have appeared in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/forza-motorsport-7/39951"><i>Forza Motorsport 7</i></a><i> </i>and on the launch roster of <i>Forza Horizon 4, </i>but no cars. They’ve been absent from<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/need-for-speed-payback/39862"><i>Need for Speed Payback</i></a><i> </i>(2017) and Codemasters’ <i>Grid</i><i> </i>reboot<i> </i>this year. (<i>WRC 8 </i>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/nascar-heat-4/40606"><i>NASCAR Heat 4</i></a><i> </i>feature Toyota’s badge and models, of course, as they are official competition vehicles or teams in those series.)</p>
      <p>The Supra last showed up in <i>Need for Speed </i>(2015) and in <i>Forza Horizon 3</i><i>, </i>which likewise had the 1998 Supra RZ and three models of the Celica GT.</p>
