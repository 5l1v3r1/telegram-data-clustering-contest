      <h2>Swaraj says State should shed its “colonial hangover” and added an ‘m’ to Kerala</h2>

      <p>Kerala or Keralam? The question popped up in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday with a demand being made to add an ‘m’ and drop Kerala forever.</p>
      <p>During the question hour, M. Swaraj of the CPI(M) argued that the State should shed its “colonial hangover” and add an ‘m’ to Kerala when writing the name in English.</p>
      <p>Minister for Cultural Affairs A.K. Balan said the government too preferred Keralam, but it has to be put into practice through frequent use.</p>
      <p>“Cannanore is now Kannur; Calicut, Kozhikode; Quilon, Kollam; and Trivandrum, Thiruvananthapuram,” the Minister said, adding that everyday use of Keralam would help to edge out Kerala as well.</p>
      <p>But it remains to be seen whether Kerala can be unseated easily, given its widespread use in the day-to-day affairs of the Government of Kerala. An exception, perhaps, is the VFPCK, which expands to Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam.</p>
