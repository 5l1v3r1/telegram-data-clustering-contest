      <p>Is <b>Ben Affleck</b> really trying to steal <b>Jessica Alba</b> from <b>Cash Warren</b>, her husband of 11 years? That’s the absurd claim in one of this week’s tabloids. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can confirm it’s total nonsense.</p>
      <p>“Ben Has A Crush On Married Jessica!” reads a headline in the latest issue of the <i><b>National Enquirer</b></i>. According to the magazine, Affleck has had a decades-long crush on the actress and isn’t concerned that she’s happily married. “Ben and Jessica got back more than 15 years, and he’s always thought she was the hottest girl on the planet,” an anonymous source tells the magazine.</p>
      <p>“Jessica may be married but that hasn’t stopped Ben from fantasizing,” adds the unknown insider, who further maintains that Affleck goes out of his way to track down Alba at Hollywood parties. “Now that he’s single, Ben’s cooking up projects for them to work on together, but first he’ll have to get through Cash, who can see Ben’s motives from miles away.” The alleged tipster adds, “Anytime Ben and Jess run into each other, Cash seethes with jealousy. But for Ben, all’s fair in love and war – no one would put it past him to try to steal another man’s wife.”</p>
      <p>In addition to being totally random, the tabloid’s report is completely untrue. The premise is based on the word of an unidentified “source,” but Affleck’s rep is going on the record to refute it. In fact, the actor is spending the next few months on location in New Orleans, where he’s shooting the thriller <i>Deep Water</i>. Are we to believe he’s flying back to Los Angeles on the weekends to pursue Alba? Meanwhile, the two stars don’t appear to know each other all that well, despite crossing paths at awards shows over the years.</p>
      <p>The <i>Enquirer</i>’s suggestion that Affleck is looking to break up a married couple who share three children is just baseless. Unfortunately, the bogus article isn’t surprising either. <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the publication in September for wrongly reporting <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-pregnant-john-miller-baby/">Jennifer Garner was pregnant and the baby might belong to Affleck</a>. The actor’s ex-wife isn’t expecting a child at all, let alone one that belongs to him.</p>
      <p>This also wouldn’t be the first time the outlet has made up a story about the movie star pursuing a famous women who’s already taken. Last year, the magazine insisted <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-wants-back/">Affleck wanted to get back together with ex-fiancée Jennifer Lopez</a>, and had no problem stealing her from Alex Rodriguez. Shortly before that, the tabloid said <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ben-affleck-shauna-sexton-married-rehab-wedding/">Affleck would be marrying Playboy model Shauna Sexton</a> while in rehab. The actor’s short fling with the model ended as soon as he left rehab last year. It’s unclear where this storyline involving Alba is even coming from, but it’s equally fictional.</p>
