        <b>TOLO television on Wednesday opens the 7th season of the Baghch-e-Simsim children’s program in Kabul.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Officials at the television and radio program in Afghanistan say the program will encourage pre-school and elementary school children to learn more.</p>
      <p>Baghch-e-Simsim is an Afghan variation of the well-known US series "Sesame Street," and has been aired on TOLO and Lemar for six years.</p>
      <p>The Baghch-e-Simsim series is a children's education program that has a large following among Afghan citizens.</p>
      <p>Zari and Zeerak are the two characters who star in the show, and in 2016, Zari - a six-year-old Afghan girl - was added as a character.</p>
      <p>Sheema Sengupta, a UNICEF representative, speaking on World Children’s Day, praised the program and said it will be useful for children.</p>
      <p>“’Sesame Street’ gives voice and participation to children and that is so important and I’m obviously not 13 years old, so when I was growing up there was "Sesame Street" but there was no convention on the rights of the child, but you know growing up and getting our voices and knowing what we speak about, and what we should speak about, even in a multi-racial country like Malaysia it was, you know, quite a different realization almost.”</p>
