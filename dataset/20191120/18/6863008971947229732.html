      <p>Ukraine's Finance Minister says state-owned banks in the first half of 2019 reduced non-performing loans by UAH 22 billion (US$909.1 million).</p>
      <p>In particular, the state-owned banks, including financial institutions, reduced debts by UAH 3.5 billion (US$144.6 million), restructured them by UAH 10.6 billion (US$438 million), and covered debts with reserves at UAH 2.9 billion (US$119.8 million), according to the ministry's non-performing loans status report.</p>
      <p>In the first half of 2019, Oschadbank successfully completed debt restructuring with Firm T.M.M. LLC, Imperovo Foods LLC, Agroholding Avangard, and PJSC Rise-Maksymko. Two debt restructuring cases have been launched with WOG Group's companies.</p>
      <p>Ukreximbank opened its first case with Office Construction Agency LLC, which became one of the largest in terms of the amount of debt to be restructured.</p>
      <p>At the same time, public sector banks are actively involved in debt collection. As of July 1, courts have more than 70,000 relevant lawsuits worth over UAH 116 billion (US$4.8 billion). Noteworthy, almost 54,000 lawsuits worth UAH 26.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) were lodged in the first half of 2019.</p>
      <p>It is also noted that the share of non-performing loans in Ukraine's banking system remains significant, that is, 51% as of July, or UAH 581 billion (US$24 billion), of which state-owned banks account for 65%.</p>
