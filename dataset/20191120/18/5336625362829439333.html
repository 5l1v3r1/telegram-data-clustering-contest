      <h1>Trump's ridiculous notes have spawned more Sharpie memes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:20:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/nicole-gallucci/" target="_blank">Nicole Gallucci</a></address>
      <p>As the impeachment hearings rage on, President  Donald Trump is busy scrawling extremely official statements with a large Sharpie on a pad of paper in all caps.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland arrived on Capitol Hill to give, what's so far been <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sondland-impeachment-hearing-opening-statement-reactions/">a seriously explosive testimony</a> against the president. </p>
      <p>Sondland kicked things off by claiming that Trump and his team were very aware of quid pro quo in Ukraine, and said, "Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret." Meanwhile, Trump spoke to press outside the White House while leaving for Texas, where he read a bizarre-looking handwritten statement to deny once again that he did anything wrong.</p>

      <p>"What do you want from Ukraine, he asks me screaming. What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas and theories — this is Ambassador Sondland speaking to me. Just happened. To which I turned off the television,"  Trump said to the crowd. </p>

      <p>Trump went on to discuss his conversation with Sondland before reading the part of his notes that were captured in several photographs.</p>
      <p>"I want nothing. That's what I want from Ukraine. That's what I said. I want nothing! I said it twice," Trump said of his response to Sondland. Trump then denied that he knows Sondland well. (For the record, Sondland <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/04/gordon-sondland-ukraine-texts-ambassador/">donated a million dollars</a> to Trump's inauguration.)</p>
      <p>Trump then added, "I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing." </p>
      <p>As is usually the case with photos of Trump's handwritten notes — which often come across as nonsensical and include their fair share of spelling errors — it wasn't long before the memes started rolling in.</p>

      <p>Trump is no stranger to using a Sharpie, and is often seen holding handwritten marker notes. You may also recall #SharpieGate, a hashtag that sparked in September after Trump <a href="https://mashable.com/article/donald-trump-hurricane-dorian-map-sharpie-gate/">presented an enlarged map</a> of Hurricane Dorian's projected path that included an extension drawn in Sharpie to reflect his earlier statement.</p>
      <p>He simply loves those thick, black, smelly permanent markers, and whenever he uses one it never fails to fascinate the American people.</p>
      <p>The way this hearing is going though, Trump might want to invest in a few more statement-writing Sharpies.</p>
      <p><i><b>UPDATE: Nov. 20, 2019, 5:01 p.m. EST: </b></i><i>Trump visited an Apple plant in Austin with Tim Cook on Wednesday where he </i>pulled out and read his Sharpie notes <i>when a reporter asked him about Sondland's testimony. </i></p>
