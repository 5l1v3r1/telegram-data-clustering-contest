      <p>Following the public launch of <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/macos-catalina/">macOS Catalina</a> 10.15.1 not too long ago, Apple is moving ahead with the next big update to its desktop operating system.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Apple seeded the third beta of <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/macos/">macOS</a> Catalina 10.15.2 to developers. As suggested by the version number, this is a minor update and, as such, it will more than likely not include any major forward facing features for the end user.</p>
      <p>However, the new software will include plenty of changes and tweaks behind-the-scenes, the majority of which will focus primarily on improving the overall performance and usability of the desktop operating system.</p>
      <p>As far as what’s new in this latest beta, that remains unknown at this time. If there are any new additions worth mentioning discovered, we will update this post accordingly.</p>
      <p>The latest macOS Catalina beta is available only for developers for now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/10/29/apple-releases-macos-10-15-1/">Apple released</a> macOS Catalina 10.15.1 back in October. That software update brought with it support for Apple’s new AirPods Pro truly wireless headphones, along with some other tweaks and improvements.</p>
      <p>There is no word on when macOS Catalina 10.15.2 will be available to the public, but it is likely weeks away.</p>
