      <p>PopSockets has become a wildly successful accessory maker over the last few years, and now the company has a brand new product for iPhone/AirPods owners.</p>
      <p>The new “PopGrip AirPods Holder” <a href="https://www.popsockets.com/p/popgrip-airpods-holder-neo-mint/802978.html?lang=en_US">from PopSockets</a> (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/20/popsockets-popgrip-airpods-holder-is-a-detachable-iphone-grip-stand-and-airpods-case/"><i>9to5Mac</i></a>) combines the company’s trademark grip design, but also throws in a quick and easy way to access your AirPods for good measure. You get the standard grip/stand design, which is also immediately familiar just by looking at it, and a standard <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/airpods/">AirPods</a> case.</p>
      <p>To release the case from the design, you just need to do a 90-degree turn to release the AirPods holder. This will make it possible to use another PopSockets PopGrip accessory if you want, and will make it possible to wirelessly charge your iPhone, too.</p>
      <p>As described form the company’s site:</p>
      <blockquote>This PopGrip has a swappable top — just close the grip flat, press down, and twist 90 degrees to swap out the top. Then, you can swap in a new PopTop or do a little wireless charging. Or just click it in and out again and again to give your fidgety hands something to do.</blockquote>
      <p>The new PopGrips AirPods Holder is available in several colors: neo mint (pictured above), iris purple, black, white, and cobalt. It’s priced at $20 and it’s available now.</p>
      <p>However! There is something very important to note here: PopSockets says that the new PopGrips AirPods Holder will not successfully adhere to the back of an <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11/">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, or iPhone 11 Pro Max. The company says that it will best stick to a “smooth hard plastic case”.</p>
      <p>And one more note: This is meant specifically for the first-generation and second-generation AirPods — it does not support the brand new <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, a creative idea! Being able to quickly and easily remove the holder is a nice touch, and being able to double as a stand/grip fits right in line with the PopSockets brand. Do you think this is something you’d be interested in, or anyone you know?</p>
      <p>Maybe it’s a great holiday gift? Let us know what you think of the PopSockets PopGrip AirPods Holder in the comments below. And hey, you get a <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/05/colorwares-awesome-custom-painting-process-is-now-available-for-the-new-airpods/">colored AirPods case</a> without having to fork over a ton of money!</p>
