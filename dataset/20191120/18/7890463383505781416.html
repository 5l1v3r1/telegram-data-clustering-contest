      <h1>A post-credits letter in Shenmue 3 promises to “never give up” on Shenmue 4</h1>

        <b>Shenmue 3 has miraculously landed after a decades-long wait, but Yu Suzuki’s magnum opus is far from complete – it’s still planned as a multi-chapter series with more sequels to come before we reach the conclusion. It might seem premature to start talking about Shenmue 4 just after the latest game’s seemingly impossible path to release, but Shenmue 3 includes a promise to “never give up” on the dream of finishing the story out.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After Shenmue 3’s credits, a letter from creator Yu Suzuki appears. “For as long as there are those who wish to see Shenmue live on, I will never give up on my own personal journey to complete its story,” Suzuki writes. “As with Shenmue 3, the Shenmue story is with you. I sincerely hope that, together, we can continue to spin the tale of Ryo and his adventures in Shenmue 4.”</p>
      <p>Suzuki <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3ahcwf/i_am_yu_suzuki_new_posting/cscni1g/?context=3">said a few years ago</a> that the Shenmue saga would likely be spread across 11 chapters and five games, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yu-suzuki-pledges-to-try-to-make-shenmue-4-via-in-game-letter-to-fans/">VGC</a> notes. The director told the outlet in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shenmue-4-will-be-easier-to-make-happen-if-3-sells-well-says-suzuki/">separate interview</a> that “If Shenmue 3 sells well it will make things easier [with Shenmue 4]. But I think it will rely more on what kind of partners we will be able to secure.”</p>

      <p>While the original titles predate today’s <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-open-world-games">open-world games</a>, Shenmue 3 has turned out to be a bit of a time capsule – and hope’s alive that 1999 is going to keep living well into thefuture.</p>
