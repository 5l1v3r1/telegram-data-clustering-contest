      <p>The transfer window re-opens in January and will come with the expected flurry of activity, but it also opens the opportunity for clubs to enter into pre-contract agreements with players entering the final six months of their existing deals.</p>
      <p>For the Red Devils, according to the <i>Manchester Everning News</i>, that means that seven of their players could start talking to other clubs in a bid to move on as free agents at the end of the current campaign.</p>

      <p>Chief among those names is club captain Ashley Young who has been a regular in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season. The 34-year-old signed a one-year extension last year but is yet to put pen to paper on a new deal this time around.</p>
      <p>The former England international is joined by fellow veterans Nemanja Matic and Lee Grant, the latter of whom has served as United’s third-choice goalkeeper behind David De Gea and Sergio Romero.</p>
