      <p>The latest builds can be acquired by developers in the beta-testing scheme via the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/">Apple Developer Center</a>, or as an over-the-air update for hardware already using earlier beta builds. A public beta version of the releases is expected to start arriving soon, and will be available through the <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">Apple Beta Software Program</a> website. <br/><br/>The second round of developer betas were released on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/12/second-betas-for-ios-133-ipados-133-tvos-133-watchos-611-out-now">November 12</a>, while the first set were issued on <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/05/apple-releases-first-betas-for-ios-133-ipados-133-tvos-133">November 5</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/05/everything-new-in-ios-133----changes-and-performance">The initial</a> iOS 13.3 beta fixed a problem introduced in iOS 13.2 hindering multitasking, by killing background app processes and making users lose work or progress in the apps over time. An update was also made to the Apple Watch app icon, showing a grey center in the Digital Crown instead of black. <br/><br/>Updates were also made to allow the disabling of Memoji on the keyboard, while Screen Time had a new category for communications. Support for NFC, USB, and Lightning security keys in Safari under the WebAuthn standard is also included, though compatibility isn't extended to all wireless versions at this time. <br/><br/><i>AppleInsider</i>, and Apple itself, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/06/04/dont-run-the-ios-12-macos-1014-mojave-betas-if-you-value-your-data">strongly suggest</a> users avoid installing betas on to "mission-critical" or primary devices, due to the small possibility for data loss or other problems. It is instead recommended to install betas onto secondary or non-essential devices, and to ensure there are backups of important data available in the event things go awry. <br/><br/><i>Find any changes in the new betas?
