      <h1>PCG honors Finance Minister, NDC Chairman and 84 others</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:33:07+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author">Bertha Badu-Agyei/Millicent Tamakloe</a></address>
      <p>Akyem-Tafo, Nov 19, GNA – Mr Ken Ofori-Atta, Minister of Finance, Mr Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo, National Chairman of the NDC, and Eighty-one others have been honored by the Akyem Abuakwa Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana (PCG) for their significant contribution towards the development of the Church.</p>
      <p>The others included Osabarima Edusei Peasah, Chief of Akyem Tafo, Mr Samuel Atta-Akyea, Minister for Water Resources, Works, and Housing, Mr Ebenezer Ofoe-Caesar, Former District Chief Executive for Fanteakwa, Professor Ampofo Duodu and Commissioner of Police (COP) Mr Kwasi Nkansah (Retired).</p>
      <p>The honorees were given desktop plaques inscribed with their names and contributions to the PCG at the occasion of the second ‘Presbytery Awards’ day Church service held at the Bethel Congregation, at New Akyem-Tafo.</p>
      <p>Reverend Dr. Seth Kissi, Chairperson of the Akyem Abuakwa Presbytery, explained that the Awards Day was to show appreciation to God for the human vessels he had used to bless his church and to express gratitude to the honorees for the sacrifices made to keep the church going in its mission.</p>
      <p>He indicated that the eighty six honorees were nominated by their various districts within the Presbytery for their immense support varying from church construction, Manse construction, church furnishing, construction of schools and ancillary facilities, donation of choir robes, seats, roofing and many others for the various congregations within the presbytery</p>
      <p>According to the Presbytery Chairperson, many others had supported the growth of the Church through ushering, cleaning, putting the chapel and washrooms in order, in evangelism and effective leadership,” however considering the fact that some of those who had helped us significantly were not Presbyterians, we had to show this appreciation”.</p>
      <p>He called on districts and congregations to acknowledge all such people in the church for their good work and hoped that the recognitions would inspire others whom God had blessed to give back to God, His church and the society.</p>
      <p>Right Rev. Dr Sam Prempeh, a former Moderator of the PCG,  in a sermon, said whatever our hands find doing, we should it as if unto God and urged the congregation to do good to all manner of persons especially the poor “for that is the great commission,”  he added.</p>
      <p>The Finance Minister, in a speech said his family, the Ofori-Atta's and the royals of Akyem Abuakwa’s commitment to the PCG dates back to centuries ago, adding that “we have no doubt that the sacrifices made by Opanyin Yaw Boakye and Madam Gyankroma for Presbyterianism, has been the source of favour and blessings to his descendants including all of us and the President of the Republic”</p>
      <p>He therefore thanked the Church for the honour done him and said, “I was 60 years just last week and am grateful to God for his undeserving favor and how far he has brought me and my family and asked the Church to continue to pray for the government to do unto this nation what was right.</p>
