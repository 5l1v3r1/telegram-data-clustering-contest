      <p>Kim Zolciak is returning to Bravo TV with her family.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kim-zolciak/">Kim Zolciak</a> and her family are heading back to Bravo TV for an eighth season of their <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> spinoff series, <i>Don’t Be Tardy</i>.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, November 19, after making a number of appearances throughout the weekend at BravoCon in New York City, Zolciak confirmed the exciting news with her fans and followers on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DHxpzje8w/">Instagram</a> by sharing a behind-the-scenes video of herself and her husband, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kroy-biermann/">Kroy Biermann</a>, taping their show confessionals.</p>
      <p>“Behind the scenes yesterday. We had so much fun. [<i>Don’t Be Tardy</i>] Season 8 baby. I love this man oh so much,” Zolciak wrote in the caption of her post, which included several videos of herself and Biermann goofing off on set.</p>
      <p>Although rumors swirled online in regard to <i>Don’t Be Tardy</i> potentially being moved to another network, Zolciak set those reports straight by confirming to a curious fan in the comments section of her post that she and her family would still be seen on Bravo TV.</p>
      <p>As fans of Zolciak and her family well know, Don’t Be Tardy was first started as a special about Zolciak and Biermann’s 2011 wedding. However, after the special premiered to stellar ratings, Bravo TV opted to turn the special into a full-on series and it has continued to deliver impressive ratings for the network ever since.</p>

      <p>While attending BravoCon over the weekend, Zolciak admitted to <a href="https://okmagazine.com/videos/kim-zolciak-new-season-dont-be-tardy-stressful-bravocon-2019-video/"><i>OK! Magazine</i></a> that filming on the eighth season of <i>Don’t Be Tardy</i> has ben stressful before clarifying that if it was up to her, she’d get paid to film with her family “forever.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a lot different than any other season. It’s definitely a different pace. There’s a lot of highs and a lot of lows,” she explained.</p>

      <p>Also during the interview, Zolciak was asked what it would take for her to consider a return to <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i>.</p>
      <p>“Honey, they don’t have enough money. I don’t mind. Therapist doesn’t have enough time. You know what? I think it was really fun, I guess when I had gone back. I thought, ‘Oh everybody’s grown, and we’re all going to be in this great place.’ And I definitely didn’t expect [the drama],” she explained.</p>
      <p>Zolciak appeared on <i>The Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> in a full-time role for the series’ first five seasons and later returned in a guest role for Season 9 and a friend role for Season 10.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5751451/kim-zolciak-rhoa-return-nene-leakes-friendship/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported, Zolciak also shot down the idea of returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta during one of BravoCon’s panel events.</p>
