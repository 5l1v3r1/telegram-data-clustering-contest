      <p>Prince Andrew will "step back from public duties" it was announced days after a disastrous TV interview on his friendship with a sex offender.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/the-queen">The Queen</a> has given permission for the Duke of York to “step back from public duties for the foreseeable future” amid criticism over his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the duke said.</p>
      <p>In the statement released on Wednesday night, the Duke, 59, said that the scandal over his friendship with American financier Epstein had become "a major disruption" to the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/royal-family">Royal family</a> 's work.</p>
      <p>He said: "Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission."</p>
      <p>He has also agreed to speak to the forces investigating Epstein's offences involving underage girls.</p>
      <p>Addressing the criticism he has faced in the wake of the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/in-the-news">Newsnight interview</a> with Emily Maitlis, he added: "I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>"His suicide has led many unanswered questions, particularly for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/crime">his victims</a> , and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>
      <p>The Queen's second son was interviewed on Saturday night and made a series of bizarre claims including being in a "Pizza Express in Woking" on the night he allegedly met Epstein victim Virginia Roberts.</p>
      <p>The Prince also said during the interview that despite his former pal’s crimes he did not regret their friendship as it helped him professionally.</p>
      <p>He was later widely condemned for failing to sympathise with the victims of Epstein, who killed himself in prison earlier this year.</p>
