        <b>Prince Andrew will be stepping back from royal duties for the "foreseeable future" following the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said his links with the convicted sex offender have become a "major disruption" to the royal family.</p>
      <p>He said he deeply sympathised with Epstein's victims and "everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure" in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has faced backlash after a BBC interview in which he discussed his relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said he had asked the Queen if he could step back from public duties, and she had given her permission.</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives."</p>
      <p>He said he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required".</p>
      <p>BT are one of the organisations to have distanced themselves from Prince Andrew since the BBC interview.</p>
      <p>Murdoch University and RMIT University in Melbourne also said they would no longer work with "Pitch@Palace" - a charity founded by Prince Andrew to promote entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Murdoch University said it had "advised Buckingham Palace it would not continue its participation" in the Pitch@Palace project.</p>
      <p>Several UK-based businesses, including Standard Chartered and KPMG, have also distanced themselves from the prince and his charities.</p>
