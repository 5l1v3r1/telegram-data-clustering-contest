      <h1>Prosus and Takeaway.com trade blows in battle for Just Eat</h1>

      <p>The two companies competing to take over food delivery firm Just Eat were locked in a war of words today as they vied to win the favour of shareholders.</p>
      <p>Prosus said the bid made by rival Takeaway.com represented “significant risks” and underestimated how competitive the British market was.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Prosus, which is controlled by South African investment giant Naspers, said Takeaway’s offer “takes a narrow view of the food delivery sector based principally on its experience in the Netherlands and Germany”.</p>
      <p>These markets “have so far been relatively insulated” from competition of the likes of Uber Eats and Deliveroo, it added.</p>
      <p>Takeaway hit back at the claims, saying it had become the largest operator in seven of its markets “fighting the same competitors Just Eat faces in the UK”.</p>
      <p>Just Eat’s board has recommended Takeaway’s all-share offer, which will run until 11 December. However, Prosus has since tabled a higher bid that valued the company at roughly £4.9bn.</p>
      <p>Takeaway has emphasised its experience in the sector, and has argued that it would create a global delivery powerhouse with significant cost savings.</p>
      <p>“Being an operator is clearly different from being a financial investor,” it said in a statement to Reuters.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The latest clash comes after a two-week period of gains for Takeaway’s shares, which has raised the value of its offer and whittled away Prosus’s advantage.</p>
      <p>Prosus’s offer also ends on 11 December and both bids are conditional on receiving 75 per cent of shares.</p>
