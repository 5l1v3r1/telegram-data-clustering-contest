      <h1>Apple Put a Dedicated Camera/Shutter Button on Its New iPhone Battery Case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:53:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petapixel.com/author/dlcade/" target="_blank">DL Cade</a></address>
      <p>Apple dropped a new ‘<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVL2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">Smart Battery Case</a>‘ for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max today, and for the first time on a product like this, the company included a dedicated ‘camera button’ that lets you launch the Camera app and take pictures without unlocking your phone first.</p>
      <p>This little discovery was made by tech journalist <a href="http://www.matthewcassinelli.com/">Matthew Cassinelli</a>, who shared it on his Twitter account. “Whoa, Apple’s new charging cases have a physical camera button,” writes Cassinelli:</p>

      <p>The product description explains what the button—a first for an iPhone battery case as far as we know—can do:</p>
      <blockquote>The case features a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app whether the iPhone is locked or unlocked. A quick press of the button takes a photo and a longer press captures QuickTake video. It works for selfies, too.</blockquote>
      <p>Apple has made every effort to emphasize the latest iPhones’ <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/09/14/heres-an-apple-ad-for-iphone-11-pros-triple-camera-system/">focus on photography</a>, and while this might not be a “major release” by any stretch of the imagination, it’s another nudge in that direction.</p>
      <p>The Smart Battery Case is available for all three iPhone 11 models in either Pink, White, or Black for $130.
