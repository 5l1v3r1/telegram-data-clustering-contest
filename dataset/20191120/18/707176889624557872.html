      <h2>Agency sparks backlash with factcheckUK account but party is embracing pugnacious tactics</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:29:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:29</time> by <a rel="author">Sebastian Payne</a></address>
      <p>The most controversial moment of the UK’s first election <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4ca8faf6-0b13-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84">TV debate</a> between the Tory and Labour leaders did not occur on stage. As Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn took to their podiums on Tuesday, the Conservative party rebranded one of its Twitter feeds into <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0582a0d0-0b1f-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67">factcheckUK</a>. To casual browsers, the party’s press office had morphed into a fact-checking service.</p>
      <p>The Tories claimed this temporary branding was to hold Mr Corbyn to account for alleged falsehoods during the hour-long debate. They pointed out that the handle remained @CCHQPress. Yet outrage ensued, as users criticised the party for misleading people by posing as a neutral fact checker. Although Conservative HQ was taken aback by the scale of the backlash, factcheckUK was the latest product from a digital operation that seeks, rather than avoids, confrontation.</p>
      <p>After its abysmal social media effort during the 2017 election, the Tories rapidly formed a new digital unit to counter Labour’s past superiority. When Isaac Levido signed up to lead the Conservative campaign this autumn, he turned to two young New Zealanders to lead the digital battle: Sean Topham and Ben Guerin</p>
      <p>Topham Guerin, their digital agency based in Auckland, worked with Mr Levido on the Australian Liberal party’s successful campaign to elect Scott Morrison prime minister in May. The pair’s tactics were based on highly-shareable content: memes that were low in quality but high in quantity.</p>
      <blockquote>These guys are the best digital people I’ve ever worked with<cite>Senior Conservative</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Internally it is known as the “80:20 strategy”. One veteran campaigner explained “80 per cent of the content will hit the mark, 20 per cent will miss or blow up. When we used to have a digital idea, it would take hours or days for sign-off. Now Ben and Sean want to get it out there. It’s better than spending a lot of time messing around.”</p>
      <p>The row over the factcheckUK account follows other controversies by the Tory digital team. The party was similarly criticised for editing an interview of Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesperson, to make it appear he was unable to answer questions about the party’s policy on leaving the EU.</p>
      <p>The clip was argued about for days, yet the Topham Guerin attitude dictated it was an argument worth having in order to spread the party’s message. “That video had three million views, it was on <i>Good Morning Britain</i> for days in a row with people talking about Labour sitting on the fence over Brexit,” said one aide.</p>
      <p>Topham Guerin’s pugnacious approach has been warmly welcomed by Tories who worked on the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum. Several senior election campaign officials, such as communications director Lee Cain, took a similar stance when arguing that EU membership cost the UK £350m a week.</p>
      <p>Unlike previous elections, Mr Topham and Mr Guerin’s digital team are central to the Tory campaign. They pair sit beside Mr Levido at the centre of the Conservative’s election war room in Westminster. At least eight staffers have joined them from Topham Guerin, while others are working remotely.</p>
      <p>Their approach to the UK election mirrors their efforts in the Australian election: use crude formats, fonts and colours while also riffing off popular cultural references to further stoke controversy. The digital campaign also reflects the agency’s core principle of having a repetitive, disciplined message.</p>

      <p>“The best social media strategy is water dripping on a stone. You’ve got to be pushing the same consistent message day in and day out. The challenge is to use a variety of content to do so,” Mr Guerin said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VlNHVOxIRw">recent lecture</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite the backlash over factcheckUK, the Tory campaign is happy with the New Zealanders and said the pair had in effect become the party’s in-house advertising agency. “These guys are the best digital people I’ve ever worked with,” said one senior Conservative. “They are full of ideas, always up for trying new things and working collaboratively. They enjoy stimulating debate and knockabout politics.”</p>
      <p>While opposition politicians continue to call on the party to apologise for both the factcheckUK rebranding and Sir Keir’s doctored video, the outrage is likely to continue, with further controversial tactics lined up for the rest of the election campaign. “Just watch this space,” said one senior Tory.</p>
