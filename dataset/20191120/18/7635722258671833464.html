      <h1>Former Dundalk and Waterford man Georgie Poynton signs for Shelbourne</h1>

        <b>Shelbourne have signed midfielder Georgie Poynton ahead of their return to the SSE Airtricity Premier Division. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Dundalk and Bohemians man spent last season at Waterford, making 28 appearances in the process.</p>
      <p>Poynton is Shels' latest acquisition ahead of the 2020 season, following the arrivals of <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/shelbourne-sign-karl-sheppard-ahead-premier-division-return-922319">Karl Sheppard</a>, Finn Harps defender <a href="https://t.co/ZHATsmJDdo?amp=1">Daniel O'Reilly</a>, and ex-Longford forward Aaron Dobbs.</p>
      <p>Still only 22, the former Republic of Ireland underage captain told Shelbourne's <a href="https://shelbournefc.ie/midfielder-georgie-poynton-signs-for-shels-2/">site</a>, it felt a natural step to sign, "When I heard Shels were interested as a northside lad it made it that bit more exciting and I’m looking forward to get going.</p>
      <p>"Obviously it’s a big year for the club with a lot of history behind them but we’re definitely on the rise again.</p>
      <p>"It was a very positive in the way Ian Morris was thinking and how it is going to go this year so I just want to be apart of it,” he added.</p>
      <p>Shelbourne manager Ian Morris says Poynton will be a key signing for the Tolka Park club, "At only 22 he has great experience at Premier Division level.</p>
      <p>"He will bring energy and quality to our squad".</p>
