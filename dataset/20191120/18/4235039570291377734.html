      <p>Chinese technology company <b>Xiaomi</b> announced on Tuesday that its mobile devices and TVs will now have the capability to warn about earthquakes without the use of third-party applications.</p>
      <p>The technology, co-developed by <b>Xiaomi</b> and local <b>Earthquake</b> Research Laboratory, <b>Institute of Care-Life</b>, will use alarms and pop-ups to alert users of smartphones and TVs about earthquakes just seconds before the seismic waves hit.</p>
      <p>Embedding such a feature eliminates the need to download the appropriate applications. It also enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>earthquake</b> warnings, Wang Tun, the director of the <b>Institute of Care-Life</b> said at the <b>Xiaomi</b> Annual Developers Conference.</p>
      <p>The latest feature is built into the latest version of the MIUI operating system. <b>Xiaomi</b> said it has activated the feature for the earthquake-prone Sichuan Province and plans to expand it elsewhere in the nation soon.</p>
      <p>This new feature is part of the company's efforts to promote the Internet of Things (IoT) application.</p>
