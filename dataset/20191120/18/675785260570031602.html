      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:59:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author">Danya Bazaraa, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/danya-bazaraa/</a></address>
      <p>The Queen has been pictured carrying on with professional duties just hours after letting Prince Andrew quit public life.</p>
      <p>She has presented the 2019 Chatham House Prize to British broadcaster David Attenborough at an event in central London this evening.</p>
      <p>This event comes shortly after it was announced The Duke of York is to step back from public duties for the "foreseeable future", in an unprecedented move for a royal in modern times.</p>
      <p>The Duke, on his parents' 72nd wedding anniversary, said that the Queen had given her permission for him to bow out of royal duties.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew - the Queen's second son - made the bombshell statement in the wake of his interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>The statement said: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.</p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>

      <p>David Attenborough was awarded the Chatham House prize along with the BBC Studios Natural History Unit for his hit BBC nature series Blue Planet II.</p>
      <p>The series raised public awareness around the world of the danger of plastic pollution in oceans.</p>
      <p>The annual Chatham House Prize honours people or organisations deemed to have made the most significant contribution to the improvement of international relations.</p>
      <p>"Plastic pollution is one of the gravest challenges facing the world's oceans, and undoubtedly an international issue," said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Blue Planet II spurred a passionate global response and clear behavioural and policy change."</p>
      <p>The series, which Attenborough narrated aged 91, achieved the highest viewing figures on British television in 2017 and was sold to broadcasters around the world, scoring high ratings in many countries.</p>
