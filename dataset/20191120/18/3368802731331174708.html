      <p>Biman Bangladesh Airlines yesterday waived its cargo handling charges for onion imports, hours before the first consignment of Pakistani onions landed at Dhaka airport.</p>
      <p>Eighty-two tonnes of onion were flown in from Karachi by an Azerbaijani air freighter at 7:15pm, Group Captain Mehboob Khan, director at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, told The Daily Star.</p>
      <p>Another consignment of the essential cooking ingredient from Egypt was expected to arrive at the airport around 1:00am today.</p>
      <p>These onions will be sold in the open market through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the civil aviation and tourism ministry at a meeting decided to waive the cargo handling charges for any airlines that will import onion.</p>
      <p>Chaired by Secretary M Mohibul Haque, the meeting was held at the ministry.</p>
      <p>Talking to The Daily Star, Biman Managing Director Mokabbir Hossain said, “We made the decision [to waive the charges] in public interest.”</p>
      <p>Biman charges Tk 18 per kg for any perishable goods, imported by any airlines, for its cargo handling services, he mentioned.</p>
      <p>The waiver of charges for onion imports will help keep its prices stable, said a press release of the civil aviation ministry.</p>
      <p>The ministry will provide all sorts of support to onion importers in this regard, it added.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said the government decided to import 50,000 tonnes of onion by cargo planes.</p>
      <p>The ministry booked a number of cargo flights of different airlines to import it.</p>
      <p>Onion prices began to rise across the country about two months ago when the Indian government imposed a ban on its export. But the prices started to rise sharply last week.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, locally grown onion was sold at Tk 100-120 a kg in the capital’s kitchen markets. But the price jumped to Tk 160 late last week and then kept rising.</p>
      <p>The price rose by Tk 30-40 a day and hit a record Tk 260 per kg. Against such a backdrop, the government decided to import onions by cargo planes.</p>
      <p>Market monitoring teams from the commerce ministry and different divisions as well as government agencies punished traders for their alleged involvement in manipulation of onion prices.</p>
      <p>In the last couple of days, the teams had imposed fines and handed down different jail terms to the offenders.</p>
      <p>The prices started dropping three to four days ago after locally grown onions and the ones imported from Myanmar, Egypt and China hit the market.</p>
      <p>Locally grown onions were being sold for Tk 170-180 per kg and the imported ones for Tk 120-160 a kg.</p>
      <p>Traders fear that onion prices may rise anytime soon if the ongoing transport strike continues.</p>
