      <h1>Thousands sign petition calling for shops to close on Boxing Day</h1>
      <h2>"Would there be a difference at all if the sales started on December 27 instead of 26?"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:07:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Nearly 60,000 people have signed a nationwide petition calling for shops to close on Boxing Day.</p>
      <p>December 26 is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year which sees many retailers launch huge sales.</p>
      <p>Shops also tend to open extra early to cope with the expected chaos and to allow as much trade as possible.</p>
      <p>However, a petition which has gone viral has called to shops to stay shut on the day to allow staff to spend more time at home with their families.</p>
      <p>The petition reads: "Staff should not be forced to spend Boxing Day away from loved ones so shoppers can get a new pair of half-price trainers that they will not even wear before starting their New Year's resolutions at the gym (far into January).</p>

      <p>"Would there be a difference at all if the sales, which will also be online, started on December 27 instead of 26?"</p>
      <p>So far, 56,277 have signed the petition.</p>
      <p>A similar call was made in 2016, which was signed by 235,678 people.</p>
      <p>Many seem to share the thoughts of thousands across the UK.</p>
      <p>Bethan Elizabeth tweeted: "I want shops to shut because there is no need for them to be open on Boxing Day, retail staff work extremely hard over the Christmas period and for them to have Christmas Day off and then return to work the next day to sit around and serve the very few customers that come in, is just cruel. It should be a Bank Holiday". <br/><br/>One said: "Petition for all shops to close on Boxing Day as well as Christmas Day to give retail staff a break, all those in favour say "I"."</p>
      <p>Another added: "I had to work Christmas Eve, Boxing day and New Year's Eve last year, they didn't even give us the "time and a half" pay they had promised."</p>

      <p>A third just wants some quality time with her daughter and said: "My daughter works weekends in retail and no one is allowed to be off on Boxing Day plus it's usual pay rate. Last year the shop was very quiet anyway. No need to shop on Boxing Day."</p>
      <p>Some companies currently allow workers to have Boxing Day off, including supermarkets Lidl and Aldi, and, most recently, Home Bargains.</p>
      <p>The brand's official  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a>  page wrote: "To all our staff: Thank you for all your hard work once again this year.</p>
      <p>"All our stores will be closed on Boxing Day to ensure you are able to spend time with your friends and family."</p>
      <p>The post then went on to thank shoppers for their "understanding and support" revealing business will resume as normal on December 27.</p>
      <p>Home Bargains branches will open on Christmas Eve, however will be closed on Christmas Day and Boxing Day with service resuming on December 27 when the sales will kick off.</p>
