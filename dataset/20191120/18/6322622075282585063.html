      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): The organisation of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation Summit (APEC) 2020 will pave the opportunity for Malaysia to become a tourism hub, other than economic co-operation, said International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Minister Dr Ong Kian Ming.</p>
      <p>Ong said towards this end, MITI would co-operate closely with the Tourism, Arts and Culture Ministry (MOTAC) to promote the national tourism sector, in line with Visit Malaysia Year 2020.</p>
      <p>"APEC 2020 functions as a national promotion stage. It is a responsibility not only involving MITI, in fact, other ministries...so that leaders of other countries, international companies and multi-national companies can see for themselves the economic growth in this country," he said when winding up the debate on the Supply Bill 2020 at committee stage for his ministry in Dewan Rakyat, today.</p>
      <p>Ong said the government would endeavour to involve as many Malaysians as possible in APEC 2020 which would start in December this year until November next year.</p>
      <p>Explaining on the allocation of RM300 million for the organisation of the event, Ong said this matter could not be explained in detail taking into account the aspect of security.</p>
      <p>"When there are many meetings (in conjunction with APEC 2020), the logistic, security and accommodation costs are high. For example, we do not want the security threat in Chile which resulted in the cancellation of APEC 2019.</p>
      <p>"There are much that we have to manage and these are among the reasons why the cost of the organisation is said to be high...but we are also seeking and inviting the private sector to sponsor several meetings which will be conducted during APEC 2020," he said.</p>
      <p>Set up in 1989, APEC operated as a multi-lateral trade and economic co-operation forum for 21 member countries aimed at boosting prosperity by encouraging a balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and guaranteed growth by speeding up regional economic integration.</p>
      <p>The members of APEC are Malaysia, United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, China, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
