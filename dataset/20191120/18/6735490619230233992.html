      <h1>‘Babsocks’ Hilariously Starts Trending On Twitter After Mike Babcock Fired As Maple Leafs Head Coach</h1>

      <p>Mike Babcock is no longer head coach of the Toronto Maple Leafs, with GM Brendan Shanahan making the announcement on Wednesday and revealing Sheldon Keefe, coach of Leafs farm team the Toronto Marlies, has been tapped as his replacement.</p>
      <p>“Today, we made the decision to relieve Mike Babcock of his coaching duties and named Sheldon Keefe our new head coach. Over parts of the last five seasons, Mike has played an integral role in changing the direction of our franchise,” said Shanahan in a statement. “Mike’s commitment and tireless work ethic has put our organization in a better place and we are extremely grateful and appreciative of the foundation he has helped us build here.”</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6195865/mike-babcock-fired-toronto-maple-leafs/">Global News</a> reports, Babcock signed an eight-year, $50-million contract in May 2015. While Babcock has brought the Leafs to the playoffs for the past three consecutive seasons, Toronto has been unable to make it past the first round.</p>
