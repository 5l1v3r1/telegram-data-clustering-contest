      <p>A Burton mum has told how her toddler son was so ill he ended up looking a little old man due to a rare kidney disorder.</p>
      <p>Valerie Galer was speaking after a Stapenhill family spoke of the horrendous time their young daughter is having after being diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, which her son suffered from.</p>
      <p>Mrs Galer, now 74, has told how her happy, healthy three-year-old son Lee turned into a sad little boy who cried a lot.</p>
      <p>She was speaking after reading the story of Alexis Khan, two, who went from a bubbly and chatty child to having hysterical outbursts due to her constant hospital treatments and may need a transplant.</p>
      <p>Mrs Galer, who is from Stapenhill, said: "He was a happy and healthy three-year-old then all the problems started after he got the measles. He got a swollen tummy and I couldn’t get trousers to fit him.</p>
      <p>"He cried a lot and then he told me he couldn’t wee and I really started to worry. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/toddler-woke-up-puffy-eyes-3484880">We went to the doctors a few times.</a></p>
      <p>"Once we were out and we saw some rabbits. Lee had never seen them before and his eyes swelled up. We took him to the doctors and were told it was an allergic reaction but it seemed he was always swelling up.</p>
      <p>"He would be getting better and then he would have another relapse.</p>
      <p>"It got to the point where I didn’t want to go to the doctors any more because I felt like they were fobbing us off."</p>
      <p>Finally Lee was admitted to hospital but Mrs Galer, who is also mum to Stephen, said her family was "kept in the dark" about her son’s diagnosis and her visits were restricted.</p>
      <p>She said: "Back then it was so different because nobody spoke to you about what was going on. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/toddler-woke-up-puffy-eyes-3484880">They just told me it was his kidneys,</a> no other explanation.</p>

      <p>"He was given penicillin and steroids but we were very much in the dark about what was wrong with him.</p>
      <p>"It was horrible because they would only let me visit during 2.30pm and 7pm so I had to leave him and he would always be crying and swollen.</p>
      <p>"I also had an 11-month-old at home and he would have to stay in the corridor if I took him so I used to have to walk from Stapenhill to Branston to drop him off with his grandma so I could go and visit Lee at the hospital."</p>
      <p>Mrs Galer said the illness forced her little boy to grow up quickly and he also experienced some psychological impacts due to his hospital stay.</p>
      <p>She said: "He looked like a little old man and for a three-year-old he did become very grown up.</p>
      <p>"He used to ask me how long he had got to stay there and he was forever waiting for the dinner trolley because the medication made him hungry but I wasn’t allowed to give him anything.</p>
      <p>"We had to test his urine every morning for protein and he was so fed up of people poking and prodding him.</p>
      <p>"Even when we went home I could see a difference in him.</p>
      <p>"He used to pull on me and get upset when I would talk to others because he thought they would call him chubby and ask what was wrong with him."</p>
      <p>Mrs Galer said the whole experience was "very traumatic" but she wants to tell Alexis and her family that there is "light at the end of the tunnel".</p>
      <p>She said: "My heart goes out to Alexis and her mum and dad because it really isn’t nice what they are going through.</p>

      <p>"My son suffered terribly and the recovery period was the worst. Even if he got a cold it was more like the flu. It took a while for him to respond to treatment and he looked like he was going to burst any minute.</p>
      <p>"It was a long and hard journey but I want to give them faith.</p>
      <p>"Lee is no longer on medication and will be 50 next month so there is light at the end of the tunnel."</p>
