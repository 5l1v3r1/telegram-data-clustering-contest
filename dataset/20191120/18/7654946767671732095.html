      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ambassador-gordon-sondland-testifies-there-was-a-quid-pro-quo-in-trumps-ukraine-dealings/?_ga=2.10980147.602236317.1574091012-2120334241.1563907552">House impeachment hearing</a> got some hip hop cred Wednesday, when EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland brought up Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky as the testified before congress members.</p>
      <p>The diplomat said that he was finally able to recall that he had a phone conversation with President Trump in a Kiev restaurant — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/gordon-sondland-i-told-trump-that-ukraine-president-loves-your-ass/">in which he said that the Ukrainian leader “loves your ass”</a> — when other witnesses said talk involved discussion of the legal problems facing the rapper.</p>
      <p>“Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing the call. It’s true that the president speaks loudly at times and it is also true — I think we primarily discussed A$AP Rocky,” Sondland told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>“I remember I was in a restaurant in Kiev,” he added. “And I have no reason to doubt that this conversation included the subject of investigations. Again, given Mr. Giuliani’s demand that President Zelinsky make a public statement about investigations, I knew that investigations were important to President Trump.”</p>
      <p>Sondland in the conversation referred to Rocky’s <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/08/aap-rocky-returning-to-sweden-months-after-assault-conviction/?_ga=2.12002995.602236317.1574091012-2120334241.1563907552">imprisonment in Sweden</a> over the summer after the rapper assaulted fought a man in the street.</p>
      <p>Trump on July 25, a day before the call, had demanded Sweden release the rapper after he was busted and sent to jail in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>David Holmes, who works in the US Embassy in Kiev, Ukraine, testified that Sondland allegedly told Trump that he should “let [Rocky] get sentenced, play the racism card and give him a ticker-tape when he comes home,” apparently referring to the political value of handling the case that way.</p>
