      <p>Kenya Moore has an announcement for her fans, and she proudly posted it on her daughter’s social media account. Here’s what she had to say on baby Brooklyn Daly’s social media account.</p>
      <p>‘As the newest ambassador for @babyquestgrants, I realize Infertility is difficult enough without having to worry about the financial burden it creates. Please join me in spreading kindness and giving financial help to those battling the high costs of fertility treatment. I encourage each of my followers to donate $5 (or more if you’d like) to Baby Quest Foundation,” Kenya began her post.</p>
      <p>She continued and said: ‘Funds will be awarded to future grant recipients to help them pursue expensive procedures such as IVF. For those of us who have been blessed with children, let’s pass this along so that others may also experience the joys of parenthood.’</p>

      <p>Another fan gushed over baby Brooklyn and said this: ‘she is so beautiful😍and always smiling &amp; laughing, such a cute spirit😍how you carried her that is her personality. 😍😍😍’</p>
      <p>A follower told Kenya this: ‘As a woman who has been married for ten years an trying to get pregnant for five this is super dope. Thanks for this, Kenya and Brooklyn. 😍’</p>
      <p>Someone else praised Kenya and told her this: ‘Beautiful Kenya!!!! @thekenyamoore Brooklyn has the best mom ever. 🙏😍🙏’</p>
