      <p>The holiday shopping season is almost upon us, so Apple is jumping into the fray and welcoming its latest holiday gift guide.</p>
      <p>Apple launches its gift guide on a yearly basis, aiming to focus even more attention on its range of products. 2019 isn’t any different. The mainstays <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts">are here</a>, of course. That includes the iPhone 11, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iphone-11-pro/">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, and iPhone 11 Pro Max. You’ve got the brand new 16-inch <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> the company just announced and the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. And of course the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, Apple’s truly wireless headphones with active noise cancellation and water resistance are in there.</p>
      <p>Apple promotes the color range of the iPhone 11, a clear case for the same phone, and the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-watch-series-5/">Apple Watch Series 5</a>. The brand new <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/09/10/apple-store-experience-update/">Apple Watch Studio</a> as well, letting customers know they can pair “any case with any band” to create the perfect combination. Apple doesn’t forget to include the Apple Watch Series 3, too, if you don’t need the always-on display that’s available with the Series 5.</p>
      <p>Mainstay products like the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> lineup, the AirPods with Charging Case, the second-generation Apple Pencil, and the new 7-th generation iPad are also listed. Apple also includes plenty of accessories for all of the products in the gift guide, along with the Apple TV 4K and the company’s first smart speaker, the HomePod.</p>
      <p>Apple doesn’t leave out the iPod touch, either!</p>
      <p>The company doesn’t forget its newest services like <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-tv-6/">Apple TV+</a>, but in this case it’s actually promoting the fact that if you buy an eligible device that can stream the new video streaming service, you’ll get one year of the service for free. Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Music are also promoted, obviously.</p>
      <p>And we can’t forget the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, Apple’s first credit card launched in partnership with Goldman Sachs. You know, the one that’s currently <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/11/11/apple-card-investigated/">being investigated</a> for gender bias in the algorithm that leads to credit approval.</p>
      <p>Apple promotes the free engraving options it offers when you buy a product from the company, as well as the fact you can trade in older devices to get store credit to use towards a new product.</p>
      <p>The full gift guide can be found <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/gifts">right here</a>.</p>
      <p>Are you planning on giving any Apple products for the holidays this year?</p>
