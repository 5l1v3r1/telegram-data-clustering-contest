      <p>Iqmal Haziq Othman, 20, has admitted to sexually exploiting a 15-year-old girl who was looking for a job on Carousell.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, the victim reportedly posted an advertisement on Carousell and said she was looking for a part time job.</p>
      <p>Iqmal saw the post and contacted the girl with the intention of having sex with her.</p>
      <p>He sent her a message and said he had an “administrative job” available for the girl.</p>

      <p>Despite being fully aware that the victim was only 15-years-old, Iqmal offered her S$100 to send him pictures of her nude body. He then offered an additional S$800 if she has sex with him.</p>
      <p>The victim agreed to show her body but refused to have sex.</p>
      <p>The victim went to Iqmal’s flat where she was coerced into undressing herself in front of him. Iqmal proceeded to undress and touch the girl’s body.</p>
      <p>He then offered her more money to perform sexual acts to which the victim agreed.</p>
      <p>What the victim did not know was that Iqmal recorded the sexual acts using his mobile phone.</p>
      <p>He continued to message the girl and pretended to be a “concerned stranger” who saw the sexual video being spread online.</p>
      <p>He told the victim he would take down the video if she agreed to have sex with him. Despite her refusal, Iqmal continued to harass her online.</p>
      <p>The victim, urged by her family, then filed a police report.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-admits-crime-sexually-exploiting-15-year-old-girl-carousell-12106460">Channel News Asia</a> reported that Iqmal pleaded guilty to three charges of sexual exploitation of a child/young person under the Children and Young Persons Act.</p>
      <p>Sentencing is scheduled for Nov 26. For each charge of sexual exploitation of a child, the perpetrator could be jailed for up to five years and/or face a S$10,000 fine. /TISG</p>
