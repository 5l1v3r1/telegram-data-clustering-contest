        <li>Most said it's because they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/real-estate-investors-millennials-buying-starter-homes-competition-2019-6">can't afford to buy a home</a> — housing costs have increased, and it's hard to save when their money is going toward student-loan debt and climbing rent prices.</li>
        <li>But some millennials <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-renting-homes-instead-of-buying-2019-7">prefer to rent</a> for the flexibility and to avoid the added costs of homeownership.</li>

      <p>More millennials are planning to rent forever.</p>
      <p>Just over 12% of millennial renters plan to "always rent" — more than the 10.7% that said the same last year, <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/rentonomics/2019-millennial-homeownership-report/">a new Apartment List survey found</a>. The survey polled more than 10,000 millennial renters in the US.</p>
      <p>The majority of this cohort — 69% — said it's because they can't afford to buy a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/typical-starter-home-cost-every-state-2019-5">home</a>. Affordability is why many millennials have been <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-wiping-out-starter-homes-real-estate-2019-4">renting longer and buying later</a> than previous generations.</p>
      <p>Housing prices have been climbing steadily — first-time homebuyers are paying <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-cost-of-living-compared-to-gen-x-baby-boomers-2018-5">39% more</a> than they were nearly 40 years ago, <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/featured/millennials-have-better-worse-than-generations-past/">according to Student Loan Hero</a>. And only 13% of millennial renters across the US will be able to afford a traditional 20% down payment within the next five years, the Apartment List survey found. </p>
      <p>That explains why most survey respondents said the biggest financial obstacle to homeownership is saving up for a down payment. Nearly half of millennial renters who want to buy a home haven't even begun saving for a down payment, and only 13% have more than $10,000 saved. </p>
      <p>Millennials are struggling to afford a home not just because of increased housing costs, but because they're burdened with other expenses, like student-loan debt. Of millennial renters aspiring to own a home, Apartment List found that 58% of those with a college degree and no student debt have an average of $18,914 saved for a down payment. That average drops to $8,200 for 50% of those who have a college degree and student debt.</p>
      <p>Saving up for a home can also be hard to do when shelling out money for climbing rent prices in the meantime. In 1960, the median gross rent was $71, or <a href="https://studentloanhero.com/featured/millennials-have-better-worse-than-generations-past/">$588 in today's dollars</a>. The current median US <a href="https://www.zillow.com/home-values/">rent is $1,700</a>.</p>
      <h3>Some millennials prefer to rent, and it's changing the face of homeownership</h3>
      <p>But not all millennials are aspiring homeowners.</p>
      <p>Forty percent of Apartment List's survey respondents said they like the flexibility of renting, 37% want to avoid maintenance and other extra costs of homeownership, and 28% said buying a home is financially risky (respondents were allowed to select more than one response).</p>
      <p>Some millennials <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-renting-homes-instead-of-buying-2019-7"><i>prefer</i> to rent</a> instead of buy, and developers are creating communities of single-family rental homes to meet this growing demand, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/26/this-is-the-fastest-growing-trend-in-the-housing-industry.html">reported Diana Olick for CNBC</a>. The millennials Olick spoke to said they didn't want to deal with the hidden costs of homeownership — renting is an easier way of life for them. </p>
      <p>That's because <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-secrets-no-one-tells-you-about-buying-a-home-before-you-sign-2018-2">homebuyers often need a bigger budget</a> than they anticipate: New furniture, monthly fees such as property tax and homeowner's insurance, and repairs can tack on unexpected expenses.</p>
      <p>That millennials are renting longer — or forever — is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-housing-changing-homeownership-real-estate-2019-7">changing what homeownership in America</a> looks like. Owning a house is no longer a defining part of the American Dream, Olick wrote, and more people are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-wiping-out-starter-homes-real-estate-2019-4">bypassing the need for a starter home altogether</a>. </p>
