      <h1>Newcastle United have said this ahead of Aston Villa clash - and Steve Bruce will love it</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | Steve Bruce returns to Villa Park as manager of Newcastle on Monday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:11:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United have hinted that they could be boosted by the return of two players against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa.</a></p>
      <p>The Magpies visit Villa Park on Monday evening for what will be Steve Bruce’s first return to his former club since his sacking last October.</p>
      <p>Bruce, 58, was relieved of his duties as Villa boss 13 months ago after a poor run of form saw them plummet down the Championship table.</p>
      <p>A 3-3 draw with Preston North End, who were then bottom of the league, proved to be the breaking point for Villa after an evening which also saw a fan hurl a cabbage in Bruce’s direction.</p>

      <p>Bruce will be hoping for a happier night on his upcoming visit and he is set to have two defenders back at his disposal.</p>
      <p>Posting on social media on Wednesday, Newcastle indicated that Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar are set to return to action.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lejeuene is a long-term absentee having been sidelined for most of the year with a knee injury, while Schar missed the last Premier League match as well as Switzerland’s most recent Euro 2020 qualifiers also with a knee problem.</p>
      <p>But the north-east club shared images of the duo in the gym with emojis which said “back soon”.</p>

      <p>Their potential return is a timely boost for Newcastle who saw <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-injury-news-lascelles-17255733">captain Jamaal Lascelles suffer a serious injury against Bournemouth prior to the international break.</a></p>
      <p>The centre-back is likely to be out for the rest of 2019 having been hurt during a tussle with Callum Wilson during the 2-1 win.</p>
