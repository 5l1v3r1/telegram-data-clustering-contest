      <p>Coronation Street star Brooke Vincent has shared an inspiring message to other mums after struggling to fit into her pre-baby clothes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/inside-coronation-street-star-brooke-17174404">Brooke, 27,</a> shared a photo of her in Watermelon pyjamas and her slippers, wearing no make-up.</p>
      <p>The star, who <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/itv-coronation-streets-brooke-vincent-17164025">welcomed baby Mexx four weeks ago</a> , took to Instagram to share the candid post.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-coronation-streets-sophie-webster-16904683">She said:</a> "Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and make up done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean, our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this.</p>

      <p>"I look like this because I naively thought that 4 weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.</p>
      <p>"I thought my jeans would instantly fit and I would just be my “old self” only with my new beautiful baby.</p>
      <p>"How wrong I was, I tried 23 outfits on at least, nothing looked right, nothing looked like me and I felt like I was looking at a completely different person, I suppose to a certain extent I now am, I am Mexx’s mum.</p>

      <p>"I sat and cried and felt ashamed that I haven’t just been able to pick up where I left off like people seem to do here on Instagram!</p>
      <p>"The reason for this post is that even when you’re in this bizarre industry you still get sucked in, you still feel a certain way when you see others posts.</p>

      <p>"So this was so important for me to say, for all the women who think they should look, act or feel a certain way after a baby DONT! Don’t beat yourself up.</p>
      <p>"Do you &amp; if 4/6/8weeks or even a year after giving birth you don’t fit in your old clothes don’t worry, you can always join my club it’s important to be honest because being a new mummy is daunting enough!</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is me &amp; Mexx are healthy &amp; happy and as soon as my baby boy looked at me, I realised he doesn’t care if i fit in my old jeans or not .. So I guess creased watermelon PJs &amp; slippers for now it is."</p>
      <p>And her fans were quick to offer their support and to praise her for her admission.</p>
      <p>On-screen sister Helen Flanagan said: "Love you your amazing Brooke the most natural mummy."</p>
      <p>Fellow co-star Katie McGlynn said: "You’re a FIT watermelon though love you my beautiful gal xx"</p>
      <p>And Samia Longchambon said: "Amen beautiful Mama."</p>
