      <h1>Jose Mourinho's Tottenham appointment feels as alien as George Graham's 1998 arrival</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has replaced Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham Hotspur manager, but his appointment is one that is difficult to fathom</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T18:40:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>The famous motto “To Dare Is To Do” is emblazoned all around Tottenham’s magnificent new £1billon stadium.</p>
      <p>It is supposed to conjure up memories of the club’s glorious past when they would win with style.</p>
      <p>The fans demand stylish football, it is written in their DNA.</p>
      <p>And it is at odds with Jose Mourinho’s pragmatic attitude towards football.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is certainly not a manager who dares. He is happier playing safe.</p>

      <p>That is why Mourinho’s appointment is so difficult to fathom. His approach is winning is all that counts. Nothing else matters.</p>
      <p>Maybe that is what Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy wants.</p>
      <p>Maybe he has had enough near misses with Mauricio Pochettino, feels good football is not enough and now he wants a proven winner to help them take the final step towards silverware.</p>

      <p>Except it did not play out like that for Mourinho at Manchester United where he won trophies - the League Cup and Europa League in his first season - but it was not enough for the supporters who demanded both.</p>
      <p>The allure of Mourinho soon wore off and it ended in bitterness, acrimony and perceived failure.</p>
      <p>He was left behind by Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp whose energy and style left Mourinho looking like a busted flush.</p>
      <p>If Tottenham get the early Mourinho then it could be an entertaining thrill ride which brings entertainment in its own way.</p>

      <p>He is of course already talking a good game, mentioning the academy.</p>
      <p>"I really like this squad and looking to the young players there is not one manager in the world that doesn't like to play young players and to help young players develop."</p>
      <p>But he does not have a particular track record of promoting young players.</p>
      <p>This feels nearly as alien as when George Graham, former Arsenal manager and player, got the Spurs job all those years ago.</p>
      <p>It was the Arsenal links which Tottenham could never forgive - even though he won the League Cup - but actually they hated the idea of his football.</p>
      <p>Now, all these years later, they have a manager who is renowned for winning trophies - but without much style on or off the pitch.</p>
      <p>And that is unlikely to keep the supporters happy.</p>
