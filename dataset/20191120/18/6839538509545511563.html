      <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk will face trail in the US over bizarre comments he made about one of the divers who saved 12 boys from a flooded cave in Thailand.</p>
      <p>US judge Stephen Wilson ordered a trial to begin December 3 in Los Angeles in the case that centres on Musk’s tweets in a disagreement connected to the rescue of 12 boys from a cave in Thailand in July 2018.</p>
      <p>Mr Musk called Vernon Unsworth “pedo guy” after Mr Unsworth, who helped with the rescue, ridiculed Mr Musk’s proposal to build a mini-submarine during the crisis as a “PR stunt”.</p>
      <p>The judge rejected Mr Musk’s argument that the term “pedo guy” was a common insult and would be seen as an opinion and not a statement of fact.</p>

      <p>The judge rejected Mr Musk’s argument that the term “pedo guy” was a common insult and would be seen as an opinion and not a statement of fact.</p>
      <p>Judge Wilson said some of Mr Musk’s subsequent statements suggested he believed the charge about Mr Unsworth to be true, which has “created a genuine dispute over the meaning of Defendant’s tweets” that “must be resolved by a jury”.</p>
      <p>Mr Unsworth has denied being a paedophile.</p>

      <p>Judge Wilson accepted aspects of Mr Musk’s argument that Mr Unsworth was a “limited public figure” who had voluntarily injected himself into the public debate about how to save the boys.</p>
      <p>To win a defamation case in US courts, public figures like celebrities must show actual malice on the part of the person making a false statement, as opposed to the lower standard of negligence.</p>
      <p>But Judge Wilson ruled Mr Musk should not be shielded him from a defamation lawsuit because the allegation of paedophilia was not connected to the debate about how to save the boys.</p>

      <p>“To allow criticism into every aspect of a plaintiff’s life simply because he chose to get involved in a limited issue would render him an all-purpose public figure,” Judge Wilson wrote in a decision earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“For defendant’s comments to relate to Plaintiff’s participation in public controversies, there must be some relationship between paedophilia and the rescue or the subs - there is simply no credible connection here.”</p>
      <p>Alex Spiro, an lawyer representing Mr Musk, said in an email that “we look forward to the trial”.</p>
