      <p>HEMPSTEAD, Long Island (WABC) -- A Long Island man has been indicted on charges of setting a <a href="https://abc7ny.com/news/12-year-old-girl-jumps-from-2nd-floor-to-escape-li-fire/1408834/">house fire in 2016 </a>that injured a 12-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>36-year-old Christful Fouse was charged with arson and reckless endangerment.</p>
      <p>The girl escaped the flames at a house on Long Beach Road in Hempstead by jumping from a second-floor window.</p>
      <p>No one else was injured.</p>
      <p>Nassau County District Attorney Madeline Singas said Fouse had gotten into a physical altercation with three people inside the home, then left, returned with gasoline and set the house on fire.</p>
      <p>"A 12-year-old girl nearly died when she jumped from a second-floor window to escape a house fire that this defendant allegedly set to settle a score," Singas said. "I'm grateful to the firefighters and paramedics who treated this young victim and committed to holding the alleged arsonist accountable for this horrifically reckless crime."</p>
      <p>If convicted on the top count, Fouse faces a maximum of 25 years to life in prison.</p>
      <p>Singas said the impact of the fall caused the girl, now 16, to suffer a fractured spine and fractures to her right foot that caused a permanent limp.</p>
