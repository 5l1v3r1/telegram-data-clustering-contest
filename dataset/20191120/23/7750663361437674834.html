      <h1>RB Leipzig 'able to sign Erling Braut Haaland for reduced fee'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rb-leipzig/"><b>RB Leipzig</b></a> reportedly hold the edge in the race to sign <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/red-bull-salzburg/"><b>Red Bull Salzburg</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erling-braut-haaland/"><b>Erling Braut Haaland</b></a> at the end of the season.</h2>

      <p>Having netted seven times in four Champions League outings this season, Haaland has emerged as a top target for numerous clubs in Europe.</p>
      <p>However, while the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/"><b>Barcelona</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> have allegedly been quoted a price in the region of £85m, it is a different story for Leipzig.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Bild</i>, the Bundesliga outfit will only have to pay £25.7m if they wish to sign the Norway international.</p>
      <p>The reduced valuation is due to both clubs being owned by Red Bull, who may be keen to keep the 19-year-old at one of their two teams.</p>
      <p>Haaland is not expected to leave Salzburg until the summer transfer window.</p>
