      <h1>So Cute! Madelaine Petsch's New Puppy Is "Like a Ferocious Little Cotton Ball"</h1>

      <p>My fellow dog-lovers will agree that few moments in life surpass the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/Black-Lab-Gets-New-Puppy-46055019">joy you experience when you get a new puppy</a> to call your own, and Madelaine Petsch is definitely among the crowd. In a YouTube video on Wednesday, Madelaine introduced us all to the new baby in her life: her dog, Olive! "When I found Olive, I was told she's most likely a Maltese-Shih Tzu mix, but I don't think that's true anymore because her body is looking very Chihuahua-ish," Madelaine said as Olive excitedly nibbled on her face. "We're still working through the teething phase clearly."</p>
      <p>Madelaine has no idea what kind of dog Olive is, but she says the puppy has already doubled in size in the past three weeks, growing from one and a half pounds to three pounds. "She's a gremlin sometimes," Madelaine added. "She bites a lot!" Still, she seems pretty dang lovable. Watch the full video above to find out how Olive got her name and to see what a day in her life is like.</p>
