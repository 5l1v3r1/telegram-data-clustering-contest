      <h2>Former Spurs boss threw his hat in the ring for his old job back before Jose Mourinho was announced as Mauricio Pochettino's successor</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:30:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Harry Redknapp admitted he threw his hat into the ring to be the new <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss the day before Jose Mourinho replaced sacked Mauricio Pochettino as manager.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> was appointed as Tottenham manager early on Wednesday morning, less than 12 hours after Pochettino's five-and-a-half years in charge was brought to an end.</p>
      <p>Redknapp, who managed Spurs from 2008 to 2012, said that after learning <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Pochettino</a> had been sacked he expected the next man in charge to be Mourinho or Carlo Ancelotti.</p>
      <p>But that didn't stop him sending Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy a cheeky text to ask for his old job back.</p>
      <p>"I thought Mourinho, Ancelotti, who's it going to be?" <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/harry-redknapp">Redknapp</a> said on <i>The Debate</i> on Sky Sports.</p>

      <p>"I text Daniel last night, I said 'I'm here Daniel, I'm just going for an Italian with my wife. A couple of hundred quid a week - I'm ready, I'm coming.</p>
      <p>"He text me back and said 'You're a star. You're my special guest at a Tottenham home game.' I thought 'thanks Daniel.'"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Redknapp urged Mourinho <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/harry-redknapp-urges-jose-mourinho-20922040">to make Gareth Bale his first signing as Tottenham manager</a> in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Bale played for Spurs under Redknapp, before joining <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in 2013 for a then world-record fee of Â£86m.</p>

      <p>Despite helping them deliver four Champions League titles and scoring over 100 goals Bale has never truly settled in Spain.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old continues to be linked with a move away from the Bernabeu, and Redknapp said a return to his former club could be the perfect move.</p>
      <p>"It could be couldn't it, yeah," Redknapp told Ally McCoist on <a href="https://talksport.com/">talkSPORT</a> on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>"What a signing he'd be for the club. What a signing. That would get him on side straight away, the fans would love that. That would be an amazing move for him."</p>
