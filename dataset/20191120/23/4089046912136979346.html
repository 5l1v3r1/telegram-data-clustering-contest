      <p><b>(CNN) -</b> They may be annoying, but scientists say hiccups may play a crucial role in our development.</p>

      <p>They may help babies regulate their breathing.</p>
      <p>In a study led by <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2019/nov/newborn-baby-hiccups-could-be-key-brain-development">University College London</a>, researchers monitored 13 newborns. They found hiccuping triggered a large wave of brain signals, which could aid in a childâ€™s development.</p>
      <p>A senior researcher on the study suggested the brain activity might help babies learn how to monitor breathing muscles, leading to an ability to control breathing voluntarily.</p>
      <p>Hiccuping is seen as early as nine weeks into pregnancy. And babies born at least three weeks premature hiccup for about 15 minutes each day.</p>
      <p>Newborns involved in the study had electrodes placed on their scalps and sensors on their torsos to monitor for hiccups. Researchers found contractions in the babies' diaphragms produced three brainwaves.</p>
      <p>They believe the third brainwave allows babies to link the hic sound of the hiccup to the physical contraction they feel.</p>
      <p>Researchers say hiccups have no known advantage for adults.</p>
