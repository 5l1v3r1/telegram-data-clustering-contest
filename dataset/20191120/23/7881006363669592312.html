      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>With the CBI Special Court dismissing the petition filed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy seeking exemption from personal appearance during hearings of his quid pro quo case, and the ACB Special Court agreeing to hear the YSRC leader Lakshmi Parvathi’s disproportionate assets petition filed 14 years ago against former AP Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, the future of these two important political figures is a hot topic of discussion in political circles and on social media.</p>
      <p>Telugu Desam (TD) leaders thought that the special Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) court dismissing Jagan Mohan Reddy’s petition to exempt him from personal appearance in court, would be of advantage to them. They could say that if a Chief Minister has to make a personal appearance in court, he is not fit to be Chief Minister.  </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Reddy had to attend court every Friday but he has not done so on the last two Fridays. The TD is hopeful that if he does not attend the CBI Court next Friday, the CBI may cancel his bail and he will be back in jail.</p>
      <p>However, their spirits have been considerably dampened after the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) Special Court agreeing to hear the disproportionate assets case against Mr Naidu.  </p>
      <p>TD leaders are of the opinion that they cannot now attack Mr Reddy for having to attend court when their own leader will have to do likewise.</p>
      <p>YSR Congress leaders are taking as much advantage as they can, alleging that Mr Naidu will go to jail in the ACB case, but the wind has certainly been taken out of the sails of both parties.</p>
      <p>Each party is saying that the other will fall to pieces once its leader is behind bars. But as legal experts point out, these cases will take a long time to wind their way through the courts, and that for the time being nothing will happen to  continue in the posts.</p>
