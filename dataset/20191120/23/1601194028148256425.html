      <h4>What's the rumor?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-paul">Chris Paul</a> headed to the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a> during the 2019 offseason as part of the blockbuster trade that sent Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets. Paul has played a prominent role for the Thunder over the opening month of the season, although with the organization increasingly looking towards youth, Paul is expected to be moved ahead of the trade deadline.</p>
      <p>The former All-Star has been strongly linked with a move to the Miami Heat, although <a href="https://www.hoopsrumors.com/2019/11/nba-trade-candidate-watch-northwest-division-4.html">Luke Adams of Hoops Rumors</a> believes that the Minnesota Timberwolves are more likely to make a move for the veteran:</p>
      <blockquote>While the Heat have been linked to Paul most often, Iâ€™d be surprised if Miami and Oklahoma City strike a deal. A team without major free agent aspirations for 2021 would be a better fit, so perhaps a club like the Timberwolves ultimately emerges as a more serious suitor.</blockquote>
      <h4>In case you didn't know...</h4>
      <p>Paul is among the NBA's highest earners and his current deal extends into the 2021/22 campaign. Nevertheless, Paul remains one of the leagues best point guards and is currently averaging 15.8 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 5.8 assists in 30.4 minutes per contest.</p>
      <h4>The heart of the matter</h4>
      <p>With Thunder general manager Sam Presti reportedly looking to offload the remaining three years of CP3's contract, a trade remains a strong possibility ahead of the deadline. As for a potential move to the Timberwolves, the team pursued D'Angelo Russell in free agency, and it is clear that an upgrade is needed at point guard. Ultimately, Paul would be a great fit for the Wolves, although a deal will depend on Minnesota's ability to stay in playoff contention.</p>
      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>The Timberwolves will be hoping to keep up their early-season form when they take on the Utah Jazz tonight. Meanwhile, the Thunder will host the Los Angeles Lakers on Friday night.</p>
