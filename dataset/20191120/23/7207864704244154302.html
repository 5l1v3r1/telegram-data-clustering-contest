      <h1>Team Biden Sends out Post-Debate Message...Hours Before Debate</h1>
      <h2>Oops.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:38:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author">Shelby Talcott</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign team accidentally sent out its post-debate email hours before Wednesday’s Democratic debate began.</p>
      <p>The fifth <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/31/joe-biden-gaffes-democrat-campaign/">Democratic debate</a> begins at 9 p.m. ET in Atlanta, Georgia, and is co-hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/16/backers-less-of-biden-fewer-gaffes/">Biden’s campaign</a> team appeared to jump the gun, sending out a post-debate-related email at 3:09 p.m., The Hill reporter Niv Elis tweeted.</p>
      <p>“Did I make you proud?” the email asked, adding that Biden is “leaving the fifth Democratic debate now.”</p>
      <blockquote>Biden team accidentally sends post-debate e-mail early, asking “Did I make you proud?” <a href="https://t.co/vyI4JmaZnc">pic.twitter.com/vyI4JmaZnc</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>— Niv Elis (@NivElis) <a href="https://twitter.com/NivElis/status/1197252180958429185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>“I hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important,” the preemptive email reads.</p>
      <p>After the mistake, Biden’s campaign sent out a second email apologizing.</p>
      <p>“You might have just gotten an email from Joe about just getting off of the debate stage. <i>That’s our bad,” </i>the email stated (emphasis theirs).</p>
      <p>“We know Joe is going to make us proud tonight. We were just so excited for it that we accidentally hit send too soon,” the email continued.</p>
      <p>It goes on to ask for donations to Biden’s campaign, highlighting that the campaign still has “$90,000 we’ve gotta raise before the debate.” It asks for subscribers to “chip in” and donate to his campaign, ending the email with “Thanks, and sorry again!”</p>
      <p>Biden’s email marks another error in a campaign that has been riddled <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/11/19/joe-biden-and-his-gun-gaffes/">with gaffes</a>. The former vice president has hit back at media outlets for reporting on them, <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/09/08/joe-biden-media-gaffes-bloody-eye/">suggesting</a> in September that when they do, it “allows you guys to avoid doing your job.”</p>
      <p>The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.</p>
