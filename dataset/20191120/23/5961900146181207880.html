      <h1>The ‘Christmas Prince 3’ Trailer Somehow Combines A Royal Baby &amp; A 600-Year-Old Curse </h1>

      <p>It just really isn’t the festive season without this very bad movie series, apparently, because Netflix has churned out another – ANOTHER – <i>A Christmas Prince </i>movie.</p>
      <p>It looks dumb as hell but will I somehow end up watching it on Christmas Day? Well, yeah.</p>
      <p>This time <b>Amber </b>(<b>Rose McIver</b>) is pregnant, and she along with hubs <b>Prince </b><b>Richard </b>(<b>Ben Lamb</b>) invite royals from a faraway kingdom to renew an ancient truce. BUT, all is thrown into the deep end when the priceless 600-year-old treaty suddenly disappears. It’s up to Amber to find the treaty “before the clock strikes midnight on Christmas Eve” otherwise her baby will be cursed. I shit you not, that’s the deal.</p>
      <p><i>A Christmas Prince 3: The Royal Baby </i>will hit Netflix December 5.</p>

      <p>ALSO, guess what apparently comes out today / tonight / tomorrow because timezones? <i>A Knight Before Christmas </i>– the one with <b>Vanessa Hudgens </b>and the time-travelling knight!</p>
      <p>I literally just checked Netflix and at the time of writing it says it’s “Coming Thursday”, which is today… so… either that’s the global release date or Netflix US is messing with me. Stay tuned.</p>
      <p>Anyway, said time-travelling knight (<b>Josh Whitehouse</b>) finds himself in present-day Ohio during the holiday season after a sorceress dumps him there. He befriends <b>Brooke </b>(<b>Vanessa Hudgens</b>), a clever and kind science teacher who has, of course, been disillusioned by love. So then Brooke decides to help <b>Sir Cole </b>navigate the modern world as he tries to discover how to [checks notes] “fulfil his mysterious one true quest – the only act that will return him home”. I wonder what it could be!</p>
      <p>Vanessa Hudgens could shit on me and I’d still love so I’m definitely watching this one.</p>
