      <h1>‘Most’ Fed board members agree to wait on rates cuts</h1>

      <p>Minutes from the Fed’s October policy meeting, which resulted in the third interest-rate cut this year, revealed that “most” members of the Federal Open Market Committee don’t see a need for additional rate cuts.</p>
      <p>Fed officials voted at the meeting to cut their short-term benchmark to its current range between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent. They later modified a post-meeting statement to play down prospects of a fourth rate cut in December.</p>
      <p>“Most participants judged that the stance of policy, after a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, would be well calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective,” according to the minutes, released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The minutes also noted that Fed officials were worried about weakness in manufacturing, trade and business investment when they cut interest rates last month. But they elected to take a wait-and-see attitude before addressing whether the economy needed more stimulus, the minutes said.</p>
      <p>After meeting <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/trump-meets-with-fed-chair-jerome-powell-at-white-house/">with the President on Monday</a>, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he told Trump about his sense of comfort with current monetary policy — just as he did at Congressional hearings a week ago.</p>
      <p>Trump, who has long pressed the Fed for more monetary easing, <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1196632739266596865">complained in a tweet</a> after the meeting that “our Fed Rate is set too high relative to the interest rates of other competitor countries.”</p>
