      <p>The Turkish Stream <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> will be commissioned by the end of 2019, with both legs filled with <b>gas</b>, Daily Sabah reported.</p>
      <p>Gazprom announced in a press release that the filling of the pipes marks the last stage before commissioning, which is to carry Russian natural <b>gas</b> under Black Sea waters to Turkey and from there to the European Union and Southeast European countries.</p>
      <p>"Activities before the commissioning of the <b>TurkStream</b> <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b>, which, according to the schedule, should take place before the end of 2019, are at the final stage," Gazprom said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The total <b>pipeline</b> capacity is 31.5 billion cubic meters of <b>gas</b> annually. Its length is 930 kilometers.</p>
      <p>The <b>gas</b> was supplied from the Russian compressor station to Kıyıköy, where the pipes on the Turkish coast exit.</p>
      <p>After the pipes came out of the sea, they continued through Turkish territory to the borders of neighbouring European countries.</p>
      <p>Earlier, it became clear that Turk Stream could fall under the shock of US Senate Foreign Policy sanctions imposed on individuals and companies building the North Stream 2 pipeline.</p>
      <p>The reason for the sanctions is "Europe's energy security issues".</p>
