      <p>BUSHWICK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- A Brooklyn teacher arrived to work Wednesday to learn she had won a very prestigious and exclusive award.</p>
      <p>Princess Francois says that when she went to school, she didn't expect to leave $25,000 richer.</p>
      <p>But that's exactly what happened after Francois was named one of 40 educators nationwide and the only New York teacher to win the Milken Educator Award.</p>
      <p>The award was announced in front of the entire student body of Bushwick's Math, Engineering and Science Academy, known as MESA.</p>
      <p>"I feel like teaching found me," she said. "I originally wanted to be a doctor, and then I joined Teach for America. And it was through that that I fell so in love with my kids. Because I was teaching in the neighborhood that I came from."</p>
      <p>She started as a teacher at MESA and was promoted to assistant principal.</p>
      <p>Under her supervision, Regents pass rates have increased by more than 17% for algebra and chemistry. And when there was a search for the perfect unsung hero to win the Milken Educator Award, her name came up.</p>
      <p>"I'm like their second mom," she said "They literately are calling me mom, and they say, 'You mean so much to me, you inspire me.'"</p>
      <p>Students describe Francois as kind and say she's teacher who will text you to keep on track when your grades are down.</p>
      <p>"I was just like just weighed down with all the stuff I was going through, and she noticed and she took me aside," senior Aisha Washington said. "We worked towards how I could get back to where I was."</p>
      <p>Francois is engaged to a teacher at another school and expects some of her $25,000 will go toward the day this Princess will become a queen.</p>
      <p>"I'm wedding planning right now, and so as an educator trying to plan a wedding, it's a lot of money," she said.</p>
