      <p>Syrian government troops shelled a camp hosting displaced people near the Turkish border in the country’s northwest on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people and wounding others, Syrian opposition activists said.</p>
      <p>The attack came just hours after an air strike on a nearby area killed six civilians.</p>
      <p>Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, said government forces shelled camp Qah, killing 15 and wounding others.</p>
      <p>The Observatory said the shelling caused fires in several tents and added that ambulances rushed to the area and were still evacuating the wounded.</p>
      <p>The Aleppo Media Centre, an activist collective, also reported that the government shelled the camp with rockets Wednesday evening killing 15 and wounding more.</p>
      <p>In the rebel-held town of Maaret al-Numan, also in northwestern Syria, an air strike killed at least six people and wounded others, according to the Observatory and the opposition’s Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets.</p>
      <p>The latest attacks come after shelling and air strikes on Idlib Province killed and wounded dozens of people in recent days.</p>
      <p>Syrian troops launched a four-month offensive earlier this year against the country’s last opposition stronghold, which is dominated by al-Qaida-linked militants.</p>
      <p>The government offensive forced hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes. A fragile cease-fire halted the advance at the end of August, but in recent weeks it has been repeatedly violated.</p>
