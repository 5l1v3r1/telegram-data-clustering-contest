      <p>SEOUL: A senior North Korean official said on Wednesday (Nov 20)Â that the United States must drop its hostile policy towards Pyongyang in order to restart stalled denuclearisation talks, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.</p>
      <p>Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui told reporters after meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that it would be "impossible" to hold another summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump if he maintains a hostile policy.</p>

      <p>She did not specify what constituted such a policy, but North Korea's foreign ministry said on Sunday that a recent United Nations resolution on its human rights was a US-led "political provocation".</p>
      <p>"In that sense, I think a summit should not really be an issue of our interest," Choe said, according to Yonhap.</p>
