      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Yes, you can set up profiles on your Disney Plus (Disney+) account as a "kid" profile to filter content within the predetermined rating group (G, TV-Y, TV-Y7/Y7-FV, TV-G). At this time, it's unclear if further content filtering will be available.</p>

      <h4>Safety first</h4>
      <p>Disney movies and their characters hold a special place in the lives of so many people. While some of us may only be a kid at heart, some fans are still actually children. A lot of what folks think of when it comes to Disney movies are classics like Mickey Mouse, Snow White, Toy Story, Up, and so many more. Though content like that is quite wholesome, not all of the shows that will be available on Disney+ will be appropriate for children.</p>
      <blockquote>Error Code 70 will appear on the screen when content is restricted due to current profile settings.</blockquote>
      <p>Disney houses more than just the Mickey and the gang. Disney also has the Marvel universe, Star Wars, Fox and more, so there is going to be things on Disney+ that need to be monitored for children. Thankfully Disney has thought of a way to help sort this out for us by letting you set up profiles on your account.</p>
      <h4>How do parental controls work?</h4>
      <p>Much like you can do with Netflix, you can set up a profile for you, your significant other, and kids to not only keep your content and suggestions the way you prefer but also to filter appropriate programming for children. When you create a profile and designate it as an account for a kid, Disney is going to allow only content that falls into a predetermined rating group (G, TV-Y, TV-Y7/Y7-FV, TV-G).</p>
      <table bordered="">
        <tr>
          <th>Content Rating</th>
          <th>Popular Titles in Category</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>G</td>
          <td>The Aristocats, The Lion King</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TV-G</td>
          <td>Phineas &amp; Ferb, Chip 'N Dale Rescue Rangers</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TV-Y</td>
          <td>The Lion Guard, Handy Manny</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TV-Y7</td>
          <td>Duck Tales, Tale Spin</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>PG</td>
          <td>Bolt, UP</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>It's unclear if there are plans for further controls within that group should you want to narrow that filter down further and not allow content for a seven-year-old to be available for your four-year-old, for example.</p>
      <p>Disney is also allows up to four simultaneous streams on an account. This means that a family could have The Mandalorian playing on a tablet in one room, National Geographic's Magic of the Animal Kingdom streaming on a phone in another room, Captain Marvel on the big screen in the living room, and Finding Nemo playing in the kids' playroom all at the same time. Just make sure that you have <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-internet-speed-do-you-need-disney">internet connection</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-much-data-does-disney-use">data available</a> available to do it.</p>
