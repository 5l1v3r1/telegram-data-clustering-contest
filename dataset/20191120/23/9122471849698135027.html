      <h1>Jay Bilas Reacts To The NCAA’s James Wiseman Ruling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:21:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>It was just a few weeks ago that the news emerged that James Wiseman, the top college basketball recruit in 2019, was <a href="https://thespun.com/aac/memphis/james-wiseman-ineligible-for-season-memphis-penny-hardaway">ruled ineligible to play</a> for Memphis. We now know the extent of his suspension.</p>
      <p>The Tigers star, who played a few games early in the year thanks to an emergency restraining order against the NCAA, <a href="https://thespun.com/aac/memphis/ncaa-announces-ruling-on-memphis-star-james-wiseman">will now sit out 12 games</a>. The normal suspension commensurate with the payments his family allegedly received is nine games, with three tacked on for the games he played while ineligible.</p>
      <p>Before he was head coach at Memphis, Penny Hardaway is said to have loaned money to Wiseman’s family to help him move to the area. The five-star center would go on to play for the former Tigers and NBA star in high school, and then signed with Memphis after it hired Hardaway.</p>
      <p>It is unclear the extent with which the NCAA will come down on Memphis as a whole or Hardaway, but the decision on Wiseman is in. He’ll be eligible to return on Jan. 12, in time for the heart of the Tigers’ AAC schedule.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Jay Bilas, one of the most vocal player advocates in the college basketball world, weighed in after news broke. He basically said that such a suspension for Wiseman was always going to come at some point, and suggests that serving one now is the lesser evil available.</p>

      <p>It is unfortunate that one of the nation’s best players will miss a big chunk of what will likely be his only collegiate season, but he’ll be back well before most casual fans fully turn their attention to college hoops.</p>
      <p>Wiseman weighed in himself a minute ago.</p>

      <p>Through three games, James Wiseman is averaging 19.7 points, 10.7 rebounds, and three blocks per game in just 23 minutes per night. This still has the chance to be a pretty special season for him.</p>
