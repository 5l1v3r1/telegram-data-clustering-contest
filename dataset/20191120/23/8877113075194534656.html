      <p>A limited quantity of Cheese Nips (11 oz. boxes) are being yanked from United States grocery shelves because of the potential presence of small pieces of plastic, the FDA announced Wednesday. </p>
      <p>The company that makes them, Mondelez Global LLC, issued the voluntary recall because small food-grade yellow plastic pieces from a dough scraper may have gotten into the production process of a limited amount of the favored snacks. </p>
      <p>Mondelez learned of the issue when yellow plastic pieces were spotted on the manufacturing equipment. </p>
      <p>The recall exclusively applies to Cheese Nips 11 oz. boxes with "best used by" dates of May 18, 2020, May 19, 2020 and May 20, 2020 (retail UPC 0 44000 03453 5). The snacks were sold at retail stores nationwide. </p>
