      <p>The NCAA on Wednesday suspended the Memphis, Tennessee, basketball star James Wiseman for 12 games over allegations that he and his family <a href="https://www.insider.com/projected-first-nba-draft-pick-james-wiseman-ruled-ineligible-ncaa-2019-11">accepted money from head coach Penny Hardaway</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>Wiseman, the potential No. 1 pick in the NBA draft in June, initially played after the NCAA’s injunction, as the university pushed back against the NCAA. The school <a href="https://www.insider.com/memphis-star-james-wiseman-ncaa-ineligible-2019-11">relented last week</a> and ruled Wiseman ineligible.</p>
      <p>The NCAA alleged that Wiseman and his family took $US11,500 in “moving expenses” from Hardaway, who was not Memphis’ head coach at the time, during Wiseman’s junior year of high school.</p>
      <p>In addition, the NCAA on Wednesday ruled that Wiseman must donate $US11,500 to a charity of his choice.</p>
      <p>The latter punishment was immediately mocked by the sports world for, well, obvious reasons.</p>
