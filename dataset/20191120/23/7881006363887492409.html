      <p><b>Mumbai: </b>Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP, Sanjay Raut, has written to vice-president M. Venkaiah Naidu, complaining that his seating arrangement in the Rajya Sabha has been changed to “humiliate” him. He claimed that his party’s exit from the NDA has not been formally announced, yet.</p>
      <p>Raut’s seating position has been changed from the third to the fifth row. But he has asked to be moved up to the first, second or third row so that he can “raise the voice of distress of the poor people of Maharashtra effectively” in the House.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Pointing out that he has been a member of the House since 2004, Raut wrote, “I was astonished to know that my seating position in the Rajya Sabha chamber has been changed from the 3rd to the 5th row. This decision was taken by someone deliberately to hurt the Sena’s sentiments and suppress our voice.”</p>
