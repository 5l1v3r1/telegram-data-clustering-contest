      <p>Week 12's FAAB report brings you some solid options to pick up off the waiver wire, especially at running back. Injuries created alot of opportunity last week, and we have some important teams sitting out during the final bye week of the year(Chiefs, Vikings, Cardinals, and Chargers), so you might be in need for some streamers. We have you covered with the best fantasy football waiver wire targets and free agent sleepers heading into Week 12.</p>
      <p>Below is an estimation of how much of your FAAB budget you should spend on these players, though obviously you should adjust based on the trends of your specific league(s).</p>

      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football FAAB targets: Quarterback</h3>
      <p><b>Sam Darnold (NYJ); FAAB Bid: 10-12%:</b>Prior to Sunday’s game against the Bengals, the Raiders (New York's Week 12 opponent) had given up multiple passing touchdowns to quarterbacks in six straight games, and they allow more than 260 passing yards per game. Even if Darnold throws for 250 yards and a pair of touchdowns, that’s 18 points in four-point per passing touchdown leagues. Sure, he’s still prone to interceptions, but I like this matchup more withKarl Josephout of the picture, and the Raiders have to travel to the East Coastfor this matchup, so it will feel like an even earliergame to them.</p>
      <p><b>Baker Mayfield (CLE); FAAB Bid: 7-8%:</b>It was a toss-up between Mayfield andJacoby Brissettfor this last spot. I still like Brissett mostly just for this week. He’s cooled off significantly since his 10 touchdowns in the first four games of the year. But his last big game came against the Texans a few weeks back, where he threw for more than 300 yards with four touchdowns. But for now, I’ll stick with the easier schedule of Mayfield. The Browns have won two straight and still have a shot at the playoffs. Mayfield had arguably his best game of the season last Thursday and gets a much easier matchup this week against the Dolphins, who just allowedJosh Allento throw for 256 yards and three touchdowns in addition to some production on the ground. Mayfield could be in line for his first 300-yard performance on Sunday.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football FAAB targets: RB</h3>
      <p><b>Derrius Guice (WSH); FAAB Bid: 12-15%:</b>Guice has been marred by injuries during his young career, but at least (for now) he’s healthy and showing off the talent that made him a second-round pick in the 2018 draft. Guice only touched the ball eight times on Sunday, but he turned his lone reception into a 45-yard touchdown while adding 24 yards on the ground. Next week the Redskins play the Lions, and Detroit is susceptible to giving up big ground days. WithDwayne Haskinsstruggling at quarterback and a bad offensive line in front of him, it could be a day where Washington leans a little more on the run. As bad as the Redskins are in pass protection, they at least rank 12thas a team in run blocking, according to Pro Football Focus.</p>
      <p><b>LeSean McCoy/Darrel Williams (KC); FAAB Bid: 12-15%:</b>You may want to go up to 20-25 percent for McCoy, but the downside is that you’d be spending up for a running back you can’t use for two weeks.Damien Williamswas questionable last week with some personal matters that kept him out of practice, but he did travel with the team to Mexico City for Monday night’s game. He then he left with what appeared to be a chest or a rib injury. McCoy looked OK in the work that he did get after Williams got hurt. In total, McCoy finished with 29 rushing yards and a touchdown on seven carries while catching four-of-six targets for another 28 yards. Ball security has been a massive concern for McCoy, and it’s kept him on the sideline the past few games behind Williams, and to the surprise of no one McCoy fumbled it last night inside the 10-yard line and miraculously recovered it on his own. Ball security is job security so I’m not entirely convinced he’s “the guy” in Andy Reid’s eyes.Darrel Williamsgets some love, as well. We saw earlier in the year how effective the other Williams could be when both McCoy and Damien were hurt, and he did pretty well Monday night. He finished with 35 rushing yards and a score to go with two receptions. The downside to claiming either of these guys is that they’ll ride the pine next week with the team off and in two weeksDamien Williamscouldbe back. Keep an eye on Damien’s injury, but these might be two players you stay away from if you need immediate help for next week.</p>
      <p><b>Jonathan Williams (IND); FAAB Bid: 7-10%:</b>This is tricky because the opportunities will clearly be there for Williams.Marlon Mackunderwent a procedure on his injured hand and will miss the team’s Thursday night game in Houston. In relief of Mack on Sunday against Jacksonville, Williams ran for 116 yards on 13 carries and had a 31-yard reception.Nyheim Hinescan get some love for a similar bid in PPR formats, but Colts head coach Frank Reich has already gone on record saying that Hines' role won’t change, so that’s at least good news for Williams heading into Thursday. Of course, Jordan Wilkins (ankle) could return soon to further complicate this stuation. Aside from the hand injury, Mack has had his share of nagging injuries before, so it’s not a terrible idea to handcuff Williams once Mack returns as it’s no guarantee he’ll be back for Week 13, though the team is optimistic for that time table.</p>
      <p><b>Bo Scarbrough (DET); FAAB Bid: 6-7%:</b>As the running back carousel continues to turn in Detroit, Scarbrough is the next man up for opportunities. The Lions are decimated with injuries, and it’s been a struggle for them to get the ball moving on the ground. However, Scarbrough did show some semblance of effectiveness against a tough Dallas run defense last week. On 14 carries, he totaled 55 yards while finding the end zone. He takes a hit in PPR formats as the pass-catching role is stillJ.D. McKissic’s. But with a matchup against the Redskins this week, Scarbrough is a low-end FLEX streamer. Washington is allowing more 130 rushing yards per game to teams, makingScarbrough’s in an decent spot next week.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football FAAB targets: WR</h3>
      <p><b>Deebo Samuel (SF); FAAB Bid: 12-18%:</b>Don’t feel obligated to go all the way up to 18 percentbecause onceGeorge KittleandEmmanuel Sandersare 100 percent healthy then Samuel’s value takes a slight hit. However, it could be difficult for the 49ers to shy away from Samuel given his performance of late. He has 28 targets in his last three games and in those last two contests he has eight receptions for 100-plusyards in each game. So when the 49ers do get Sanders and Kittle back, why would they take the ball out of Deebo’s hands? Sure, the other two will get work, but it’s still feasible to think that the rookie could get six-to-eight targets per game, especially with howthe running game has occasionally struggled at times despite Kyle Shanahan’s best efforts to get that going. The 49ers and Samuel get a very good matchup this coming week against Green Bay that should feature plenty of targets to go around in San Francisco.</p>
      <p><b>DeVante Parker (MIA); FAAB Bid: 12-15%: </b>Parker’s no stranger to the waiver column, and while his ownership has gone up in Yahoo leagues, he’s still below 50 percentowned on ESPN, which is surprising when he’s been a top-25 wide receiver all season. He has at least six targets in five straight gamesand in three of those games he has 10 targets. He has four touchdowns in his past seven games, and even in a difficult matchup this past Sunday against the Bills, he still finished with seven receptions for 135 yards. The rest of the schedule is very tempting for Miami ifRyan Fitzpatrickremains their quarterback, which he should. The Dolphins don’t go up against a truly difficult secondary until Week 17 against the Patriots, when most fantasy football leagues are done.</p>
      <p><b>Randall Cobb (DAL); FAAB Bid: 5-10%:</b>Despite the numerous mouths to feed in Dallas withEzekiel Elliott,Amari Cooper,Michael Gallup,etc., Cobbhas seen three straight games with at least seven targets, and he has a touchdown in back-to-back games. The downside is that the schedule gets pretty difficult for Dallas going forward. Next week they’ll play the Patriots on the road, and while Cobb won’t be shadowed byStephon Gilmore, he will likely still have a pretty difficult day out of the slot. The Patriots are allowing just more than 150 passing yards per game. Dallas could easily top 200 yards on volume alone, but Cobb’s value is going to take a hit with a fairly difficult schedule coming up.</p>
      <p><b>Tim Patrick (DEN); FAAB Bid: 6-7%:</b>Patrickhas largely been an afterthought this season, but that’s because he’s been hurt. He wasted no time making some noise on Sunday to the tune of four catches for 77 yards on eight targets.Brandon Allen’s completion percentage isn’t great, but he did throw the ball 39 times against the Vikings, and he made it clear he had three targets in mind:Courtland Sutton,Noah Fant, and Patrick. Those three accounted for 28 of his targets. Patrick’s basically available everywhere and could be worth a grab. The Broncos have a difficult road matchup against the Bills in Week 12, but the schedule gets easier for Denver, and the Broncos could find themselves throwing it as much as they did this past Sunday.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football FAAB targets: Tight End</h3>
      <p><b>Noah Fant (DEN); FAAB Bid: 8-10%:</b>WithTravis Kelce,Hunter Henry, and Kyle Rudolphon bye this week, there’s a need for tight end streamers in Week 12. Fantis coming off a game where he led all Broncos pass-catchers in targets with 11, despite only catching four. But the target share is enough to perk your ears up. He has 24 total targets in his last three games, and similar toTim Patrickmentioned above, the matchup is tough against the Bills this week. Ryan Fitzpatrickmanaged to throw for more than 300 yards on the Bills, but he really needed volume to get there. But Denver hasn’t heldBrandon Allenback from a large volume of pass attempts, so there’s some optimism for Fant and his fellow pass-catchers. It’s possible that Fant is breaking out toward the end of his rookie season, and the schedule gets much easier after this week.</p>
      <p><b>Jacob Hollister (SEA); FAAB Bid: 7-8%:</b>Hollister is coming off his bye week, so if you ownTravis Kelce, this might be a good guy to target on the wire. In his two games prior to the team’s bye week, Hollister saw 16 targets and found the end zone three times. The Eagles have only allowed three touchdowns all season to tight ends, but even last week Benjamin Watson had three catches for 52 yardsand the Patriots offense is in much worse shape than Seattle’s. With Hollister’s recent success, the Seahawks should look to keep him involved against a weak Philadelphia secondary.</p>
      <p><b>Ryan Griffin (NYJ); FAAB Bid: 6-7%:</b>WithChris Herndon out of the picture for this year, Griffin is the featured tight end in the Jets offense ... whatever that means. But he can still be productive for fantasy purposes. Everyone knew the Jets schedule was going to get easier, and we’ve seen it withSam Darnold’s performances lately. Griffin has at least four receptions for 50 yards in three of his past four games, and he gets a pretty good matchup against the Raiders, who have allowed seven touchdowns to tight ends on the season. Griffin’s a viable streamer if you’re aKelceowner in deeper leagues.</p>
      <p><b>Cameron Brate (TB); FAAB Bid: 5-6%:</b>I can't believe I almost forgot to mention a guy who is coming off 14 targets. Brate and Jameis Winston have a well-documented history, and while Brate's a little inconsistent (and has had issues staying healthy), you have to acknowledge 10 catches on 14 targets. Brate still finds his way to the bottom of the list because it's not a great matchup against a rejuvenated Falcons defense this week. But he's still worth looking at in deeper leagues even if he moves forward with five-to-seven targets per game.</p>

      <h3>Week 12 Fantasy Football FAAB targets: D/ST</h3>
      <p><b>Atlanta Falcons:</b>So, the Falcons suddenly have a pass rush. Who knew? After totaling just seven sacks through their first eight games, the Falcons have 11 sacks in their past two games while allowing just a dozen total points to New Orleans and Carolina -- both on the road. This week the Falcons get the Buccaneers at home. The Bucs allowJameis Winstonto get sacked 8.3 percentof the time, and of course it’s Winston, so he’s prone to multiple turnovers in a game.The Falcons picked off Kyle Allen four times last week. Since coming off its bye week, the Falcons defense has been very impressive.</p>
      <p><b>Cleveland Browns:</b>Despite the better play of the Dolphins, they’re still an offense we want to target in fantasy. Fantasy D/STs have posted at least nine fantasy points in nine of 10 games against the Dolphins this season, and in the one outlier, the Jets still had a six-point return, which is perfectly fine. The concern is with the Browns’ pass rush, asMyles Garrettwon’t be playing after his actions in last Thursday’s game, andLarry Ogunjobiwill likely miss the game since I don’t think his suspension will be dropped. The Dolphins offensive line still has a 9.8-percentadjusted sack rate, which is third worst in the league.</p>
      <p><b>Seattle Seahawks:</b>I’m not a fan of this matchup since the Seahawks have to travel to the East Coast to play the Eagles in a 1:00 p.m. ET game. However, Seattle is coming off their bye, and the Eagles are a little banged up. They were withoutAlshon JefferyandJordan Howardlast week and they lostLane JohnsonandJason Petersin the game. Those two losses could prove to be costly. If they’re inactive in Week 12, then it could be a fun day for the Seattle pass rush.</p>
