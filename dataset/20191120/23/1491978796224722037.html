      </p>
      <p>Romeo and Juliet, the starting point for numerous operas, ballets and musicals, is now the inspiration – if that is the word – for this bizarre jukebox bonanza in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/25/were-not-made-to-be-famous-max-martin-the-powerhouse-of-pure-pop">the back</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/25/were-not-made-to-be-famous-max-martin-the-powerhouse-of-pure-pop"> catalogue of the prolific Swedish tunesmith Max Martin</a>, has been shoehorned into a silly story derived from Shakespeare’s play. David West Read, who did the book, writes in the programme: “It was during this period when my brain wasn’t working properly that I developed the idea for &amp; Juliet.” I’m not sure he is being ironic.</p>
      <p>The show starts in London’s Shoreditch with Shakespeare and his wife, <a href="https://www.shakespeare.org.uk/explore-shakespeare/shakespedia/william-shakespeare/william-shakespeares-family/anne-hathaway/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI65y31tn45QIVirTtCh2GVgDeEAAYASAAEgIXEPD_BwE">Anne Hathaway</a>, having a marital spat about the ending of his tragedy about doomed love. “What if Juliet didn’t kill herself?” asks Anne, devising a sequel in which the revived heroine defies her parents’ plan to send her to a nunnery and flees to Paris accompanied by her nurse and a non-binary best friend called May. Periodically, Shakespeare tries to retrieve a story that defies synopsis. I would add that it is odd to present Juliet as an icon of independence and then land her with jokes in which she pronounces <i>ce soir</i> as “Caesar” and greets a woman called Madeleine as “Vasseline.” The idiotic book is simply a way of contriving to work in such familiar chart-toppers as Baby One More Time and It’s Gonna Be Me. The one time I thought this worked was when May, played by Arun Blair-Mangat as a cross-dressing guy, sang I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.</p>
      <p>But if tedium is kept at bay, it is largely through the noisy energy of Luke Sheppard’s production and the performances of Miriam-Teak Lee as the freedom-seeking Juliet, Cassidy Janson as the mutinous Anne Hathaway and Oliver Tompsett as her vainglorious husband. I still fail to see the point of a show like this: if the audience want to hear just the songs, why not present them in concert form? It feels gratuitous to attach them to a plot that, in its desperation to sound the right feminist notes, becomes almost painfully hip.</p>
      <p>• At <a href="https://www.andjulietthemusical.co.uk/">Shaftesbury theatre, London</a>, until 30 May.</p>
