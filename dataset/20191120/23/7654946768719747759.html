      <p>Real estate titan Louise Sunshine is in contract to sell her duplex penthouse at 10 Venetian Way in Miami.</p>
      <p>The final sale price is not yet available.</p>
      <p>Sunshine is now a strategic advisor for Fort Partners, where she has tapped Douglas Elliman’s Fredrik Eklund and John Gomes to rep a soon-to-be-completed $35 million penthouse at the Four Seasons Hotel and Residences at the Surf Club in Surfside, Florida.</p>

      <p>We hear Sunshine herself is gearing up for a move to that same oceanfront development.</p>
      <p>Sunshine’s soon-to-sell home — a 6,422-square-foot, six-bedroom, six-bathroom pad — was last asking $6.49 million.</p>
      <p>The residence is a combo of two separate penthouses, featuring a dramatic glass staircase, an open kitchen, 22-foot ceilings and stunning views of Biscayne Bay and the Miami skyline.</p>
      <p>The unit also features three sprawling terraces and comes with five parking spaces.</p>
      <p>Building amenities include a “resort-style” pool, a gym, tennis courts and a concierge.</p>
      <p>The listing broker of her 10 Venetian Way home is Jill Hertzberg, of Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate.</p>
