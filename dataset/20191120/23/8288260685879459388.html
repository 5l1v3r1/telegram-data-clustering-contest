      <p>Nadine Coyle has rubbished claims she did not get on with her Girls Aloud bandmate Cheryl, calling it "fake news".</p>
      <p>The group split in 2013 amid rumours of feuds and in-fighting, and the Irish singer recently admitted that she had not really spoken with her bandmates since then, with the exception of Sarah Harding.</p>
      <p>However, opening up to fellow campmate Jacqueline Jossa on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, Coyle said rumours about her relationship with Cheryl were not accurate.</p>
      <p>As they were sat by the creek, Jossa asked Coyle if she got on with everyone in the group, and she replied: "Yes."</p>

      <p>The actress said she had heard that Coyle did not get on with Cheryl, and she responded: "Fake news."</p>
      <p>Girls Aloud - made up of Coyle, Cheryl, Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh - was created during TV talent show Popstars: The Rivals in 2002.</p>
      <p>Coyle said being in the group had been "really good".</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>She said: "I like being in a girl band. I am one of three sisters and went to an all-girls grammar school so I'm used to being around girls."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
