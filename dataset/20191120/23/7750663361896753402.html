      <p>Having suffered ankle injuries before the international break, the pair missed out on representing Scotland and Egypt respectively over the past week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a> would have hoped that the time on the sidelines would have been sufficient for the pair to be available for the trip to Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>However, multiple outlets have revealed that the left-back and winger will play no part of the game against the Eagles.</p>
      <p>The duo will be keen to be available for the Champions League meeting with Napoli, which takes place four days later.</p>
