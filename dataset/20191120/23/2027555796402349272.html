      <h1>HC slams law minister for remark on judges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:03:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/shivakumar-menasinakai" target="_blank">Shivakumar Menasinakai</a></address>
      <p>The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday slammed Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J C Madhuswamy for his recent comment on efficiency of judges and government advocates.</p>
      <p>Justice B Veerappa was hearing a writ petition on the issue.</p>
      <p>The advocate for the government sought time for filing objections.</p>
      <p>Replying to this, Justice Veerappa said, “Your law minister has made a statement in a public function that the government’s cases were delayed because judges adjourn the cases repeatedly. But in the court, government advocates ask for adjournment again and again’’.</p>
      <p>Further, he said, ‘’judges are ready to work all 365 days and no one can have suspicion over our commitment. But a minister should not give statements without knowing his responsibilities.”</p>
      <p>Recently, Madhuswamy had made a statement during the inauguration of the ACMM court in the city.</p>
      <p>“The government cases are delayed because judges adjourn the hearing’’, the law minister had said.</p>
