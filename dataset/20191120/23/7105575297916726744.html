Have you ever fallen in love with someone you haven't even talked to? Have you ever been so alone you spend the night confusing a man in a coma?"</p>

      <p><b>Bird Lady</b>: "A person's heart and feelings are very different than skates."</p>
      <p><b>Kevin McCallister</b>: "They're kind of the same thing. If you won't use your heart, who cares if it gets broken? If you just keep it to yourself, maybe it'll be like my rollerblades. When you do decide to try it, it won't be any good. You should take a chance. Got nothing to lose."</p>
