      <p>Disney<a href="https://abc7.com/entertainment/high-school-musical-series-on-disney+-renewed-for-season-2/5629311/"> announced last month</a> that Hallie Todd, Robert Carradine and Jake Thomas will reprise their roles as Jo, Sam and Matt McGuire in the "Lizzie McGuire" series coming to <a href="http://disneyplus.com/?cid=DTCI-Synergy-ABCOwnedTV-Site-Awareness-DisneyPlus-US-DisneyPlus-LIZZIEMCGUIRE-EN-ArticleLink-ABCOTVLizzieMcGuireGordo-NA">Disney's streaming service</a>.

She seemingly has it all - her dream job as an assistant to a fancy New York City decorator, her dream guy and a picturesque Brooklyn apartment - but things aren't always as they seem. With a little help from her friends, her loving family and her 13-year-old alter-ego in animated form, Lizzie navigates the ups and downs of adulthood."<br/><br/>Prior to the series' announcement in August, Duff had repeatedly hinted in interviews that a "Lizzie McGuire" reboot, first reported by Deadline Hollywood, could be in the works.
