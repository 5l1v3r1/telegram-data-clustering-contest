      <h1>Uber will start audio-recording rides as a safety measure</h1>
      <h2>Riders and passengers won’t be able to access the recordings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:28:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/users/Aliya%20Chaudhry" target="_blank">Aliya Chaudhry</a></address>
      <p>Uber will launch a feature to audio-record rides in the United States as a way to ensure passenger and driver safety, according to company communications accessed by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/20/uber-plans-start-audio-recording-rides-us-safety/"><i>The Washington Post</i></a><i> </i>and confirmed by Uber itself. The company says it plans to test the feature in Mexico and Brazil next month before deciding when to bring it to the US.</p>
      <p>Drivers can set up the feature to automatically record all rides, while passengers will have to activate the feature through the app’s Safety Toolkit before getting into a car; it’s not clear whether they’ll have to enable the feature before each and every ride. Either way, riders and passengers won’t be notified when recording starts — Uber says they’ll get a general warning when the feature becomes available, as well as prompts asking them to grant the app microphone access.</p>
      <p>Riders can choose to submit the recording to Uber’s customer support team when they report a safety issue. The recordings are saved in case a user decides to report the incident later.</p>
      <aside>Riders and drivers won’t be able to access the audio themselves</aside>
      <p>The recordings will be encrypted and riders and drivers won’t be able to access the audio themselves, but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-safety/uber-to-let-passengers-record-rides-in-effort-to-curb-crime-in-latin-america-idUSKBN1XG33I"><i>Reuters </i>reported earlier this month</a> that the initial rollout of this feature in Mexico and Brazil may make those recordings available to law enforcement officials upon request.</p>
      <p>The feature may raise some privacy issues: several states have wiretapping statutes that prohibit recording people without consent from both parties to a conversation. This is further complicated when multiple passengers are involved. Uber says it is still working out these issues.</p>
      <p>Uber has been faced with ongoing concerns about user safety, namely, its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290630/uber-sued-sexual-assault-driver-dc-lawsuit">history of sexual assault cases</a>. At least 103 Uber drivers have been accused of sexually assaulting or harassing their passengers, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/30/technology/uber-driver-sexual-assault/index.html">CNN reported last year</a>, and at least 31 drivers have been convicted for crimes including forcible touching, false imprisonment and rape.</p>
      <p>Since then, Uber has been taking steps to improve safety within its app, such as allowing passengers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17402172/uber-911-panic-button-app-live-us">to dial 911 directly from the app</a> and announcing a feature that allows riders to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20884800/uber-app-announcement-ubereats-safety-transit-updates">report safety issues</a> during the ride. A year ago, <a href="https://medium.com/uber-under-the-hood/counting-it-is-the-first-step-towards-ending-it-3b63163e1330">Uber announced</a> it would be releasing a transparency report this year containing data about sexual assaults, but the report hasn’t been released yet.</p>
      <p>Uber has also had several cases of sexual harassment within its company. Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler wrote a viral account of sexism and harassment at the company. The ensuing investigation into sexual harassment at Uber led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15747438/uber-sexism-harassment-investigation-20-employees-fired">the firing of 20 employees.</a></p>
      <p>The rideshare company used to have a policy of mandatory arbitration for cases of sexual assault and harassment, but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ends-mandatory-arbitration-clauses-for-sexual-harassment-claims-1526378400">ended it last year</a>.</p>
