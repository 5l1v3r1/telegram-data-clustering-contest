      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 20 — Wall Street was in the red for a second straight day yesterday as the light at the end of the tunnel in the US-China trade war continued to dim.</p>
      <p>Investors also digested the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes, which confirmed the US central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates again anytime soon.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average and broader S&amp;P 500 both fell 0.4 per cent to end the day at 27,821.09 and 3,108.37, respectively, in the second straight day of losses.</p>
      <p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.5 per cent, closing at 8,526.73.</p>
      <p>The three major indices all remain less than one percent below all-time highs recorded on Monday.</p>
      <p>Stocks sank mid-afternoon following a Reuters report that the partial trade deal with China that President Donald Trump announced last month may not be completed before the end of this year.</p>
      <p>Washington is poised to add tariffs on another US$160 billion (RM666 billion) in Chinese goods next month.</p>
      <p>Trump told reporters again yesterday that talks with Beijing continued but that he felt no pressure to strike a bargain.</p>
      <p>Hope for a successful truce had lifted Wall Street to fresh records this month.</p>
      <p>“You can see that it has been paring some of these losses,” Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial, told AFP.</p>
      <p>“If we pare the losses, it suggests that traders and investors think there’s still hope for a phase one deal.”</p>
      <p>Among individual companies, big-box retailer Target soared 14.3 per cent — its best day since August 21 — after reporting higher third-quarter earnings on a 4.5 per cent increase in comparable store sales.</p>
      <p>Home-improvement retailer Lowe’s also jumped 3.9 per cent as it also reported higher profits that it said reflected a “solid macroeconomic backdrop” that has boosted consumption. — AFP</p>
