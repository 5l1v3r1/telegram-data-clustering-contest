      <h1>ESPN’s Prediction For Tonight’s Celtics-Clippers Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:51:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The Los Angeles Clippers take on one of the best teams that the Eastern Conference has to offer when they host the Boston Celtics tonight.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles has played well, but hasn’t quite blown teams away with Kawhi Leonard and Paul Georgia both either hurt or having their minutes managed at various times. A 9-5 record is nothing to sneeze at, but considering that three of those losses came when Kawhi was inactive, it’s clear that he’s an X-factor.</p>
      <p>Boston has the best record in the Eastern Conference thanks in part to a stellar coaching job from Brad Stevens and a quick integration of Kemba Walker into his system. At 11-2 on the season, Kyrie Irving has quickly become a forgotten man in the Celtics locker room.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401160854">ESPN’s computer model</a> has released its prediction for the Celtics-Clippers game.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s computer model believes that Los Angeles has the edge. The computer model gives the Clippers a 60.5 percent chance to win tonight’s game.</h3>
      <p>Luckily for all of us, Kawhi Leonard is expected to play tonight, which means we may finally get a chance to see him and a healthy Paul George on the court together.</p>
      <p>This should be a fun one.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 10:00 p.m. EST and will air on ESPN.</p>
