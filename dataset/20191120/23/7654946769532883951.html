      <p>Bow-tied lawyer William Zabel’s prewar pad at 850 Park Ave. is back on the market for $3.25 million, following a price drop and a broker swap.</p>
      <p>Zabel is best known for orchestrating the massive $7.2 billion settlement between the US government and the estate of Jeffry M. Picower, a late investor who profited from the notorious Bernie Madoff-led ponzi scheme.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Zabel has represented clients <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/howard-stern/">including Howard Stern</a> and <a href="https://nypost.com/tag/matt-lauer/">disgraced TV anchor Matt Lauer</a>.</p>

      <p>After living in the apartment for almost 40 years with his wife, Deborah, the Zabels moved into a new $7.9 million abode at 10 Gracie Square that’s big enough to host their seven grandchildren.</p>
      <p>This Park Avenue three-bedroom co-op originally asked $4.2 million in January before lowering its price to $3.49 million in June. It features a foyer, 10-foot ceilings in the living room (which also has a wood-burning fireplace).</p>
      <p>There’s also a formal dining room and a chef-grade kitchen with a butler’s pantry and a wine refrigerator.</p>
      <p>The building was also home to the late designer Kate Spade; she died there in 2018.</p>
      <p>Her unit, purchased with her husband and colleague Andy Spade in 1999, <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2019/11/19/kate-spades-ues-co-op-sells-for-5-8m/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=NY%20Daily%20-%2011.20.19&amp;utm_term=New%20York%20Daily">just sold for $5.8 million</a> to new owners Shaila and Mamoon Zamir, according to a story published Tuesday by the Real Deal.</p>
      <p>Building amenities include storage, a bike room and a gym.</p>
      <p>The listing brokers are Mark Jovanovic and Scott Hustis, of Compass.</p>
