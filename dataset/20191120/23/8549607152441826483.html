        <b>As part of efforts to curb the use of blockchain-based virtual currencies for unlawful activities such as money laundering, the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://btcmanager.com/huobi-crypto-exchange-set-to-launch-in-the-us-gets-fincen-registration/">FinCEN</a>) has mandated all money services businesses (MSBs) such as Bitcoin (BTC) trading venues to start transmitting certain customer info for transactions up to $3,000 or higher. The new funds “travel rule” will take effect from June 2020, reports <i>FinTech Futures</i> on November 20, 2019.</b>

      <h3>FinCEN Increases AML Oversight </h3>
      <p>Despite having already put in place several strict, and clear cut regulatory <a href="https://btcmanager.com/fincen-guidance-money-services-businesses-msbs/">guidelines</a> for money services business operating (MSBs) and crypto market participants in the United States, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has introduced new rules to complement existing ones.</p>
      <p>Dubbed the “travel rule,” the new regulation has made it compulsory for crypto exchanges to verify their customers’ identities and share the details of customers who transfer up to $3,000 or more at any given time, as well as the data of beneficiaries of such transactions and “send that info to counterparties if they exist.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2019/11/us-government-plans-strict-enforcement-of-aml-travel-rule-for-crypto-firms/">Reportedly</a>, FinCEN Director Kenneth Blanco made the statement during a conference organized by blockchain analytics firm, Chainalysis.</p>
      <p>Blanco said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“The travel rule applies to CVC’s (convertible virtual currencies) and we expect that you will comply- period. That’s what our expectation is. You will comply. I don’t know what the shock is. This is nothing new.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The new guideline will take effect from June 2020.</p>
      <h4>Crypto Crimes on the Rise </h4>
      <p>Initially introduced by FinCEN in 1996 as part of anti-money laundering guidelines for all financial institutions in the U.S, the financial watchdog expanded the funds travel rule to crypto exchanges in March 2013.</p>
      <p>While the rate of crypto-fuelled money laundering is yet to reach that of fiat currencies (roughly <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/globalization.html">$800 billion annually</a>), bad actors are getting increasingly <a href="https://btcmanager.com/president-payment-processing-bitfinex-tether-arrested-polish-authorities/">sophisticated</a> in their acts with each passing day and financial regulators across the globe are now working hard to remain on top of the curve.</p>
      <p>In May 2019, <i>BTCManager</i> <a href="https://btcmanager.com/crypto-exchanges-hot-seat-japanese-regulators-increase-oversight/">informed</a> that Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) had mandated all exchanges in the region to overhaul their know-your-customer (KYC) and AML processes, to make it watertight. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) <a href="https://btcmanager.com/fatf-guidelines-cryptocurrencies/">released</a> fresh anti-money laundering guidelines to govern the operations of crypto exchanges. </p>
