      <p>Others were the Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, Prof. Godwin Udom; and the Chairman, Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC) Akwa Ibom State Chapter, Comrade. Sunny James.</p>
      <p>Dean of Students Affairs Dr. Aniekan Brown commended the students for their maturity, saying the election that produced the SUG leaders was rancour free.</p>
