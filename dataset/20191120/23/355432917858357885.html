      <h1>Chances of third Israeli election rise after Netanyahu rival fails to form coalition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:45:44+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/tal-axelrod" target="_blank">Tal Axelrod</a></address>
      <p>Chances for a third Israeli election in less than a year rose on Wednesday after Prime Minister <a href="https://thehill.com/people/benjamin-bibi-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>’s chief rival announced he would miss a deadline to form a ruling coalition. </p>
      <p>Benny Gantz, the leader of the centrist Kahol Lavan party, announced that he was unable to put together a government by Wednesday’s midnight deadline following Netanyahu’s own failure to do so.</p>
      <p>The Israeli Parliament, known as the Knesset, now starts a 21-day period in which it can try to nominate any one of its 120 lawmakers to try and establish a coalition.</p>
      <p>Should that effort fail, an election is triggered within 90 days, sending Israelis to the polls for an unprecedented third time in under a year.</p>
      <p>Gantz said he had turned over every possible stone in the 28-day period he was allotted to form a coalition but expressed confidence that his support would grow in a third election, according to a translation of his comments by The Hill.</p>
      <p>Kahol Lavan won 33 out of 120 Knesset seats and Likud won 31 seats in parliamentary elections in September, the second such election of the year.</p>
      <p>Gantz’s bloc, comprised of other centrist and center-left parties, won 57 seats in total, while Netanyahu’s bloc, made up of other right-wing and ultra-Orthodox groups, won 55, denying either side a parliamentary majority. </p>
      <p>Netanyahu later said he was open to crafting a unity government with Gantz, though Gantz has only expressed interest in a unity government with him at the helm.</p>
      <p>Gantz has specifically ruled out joining a coalition with Netanyahu, who is dogged by looming corruption charges.</p>
      <p>The impasse also shifts focus to Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the right-wing, secular Yisrael Beitanu party. His bloc controls enough seats to give either Netanyahu or Gantz a majority, though he has objected to Netanyahu’s cooperation with ultra-Orthodox parties and claims that Gantz’s coalition would rely on support from Arab parties that he has labeled a “fifth column.”</p>
