        <b>JEREMY Corbyn’s manifesto will be the most irresponsible and dangerous ever published by a mainstream party.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It will be stuffed with freebies, based on fantasy figures, all “funded” by repeatedly spending the same taxes extracted only from the “rich”.</p>

      <p>A blueprint for national bankruptcy. The catastrophic destruction of property rights, repelling job-creating investors in an instant.</p>
      <p>Corbyn poses as a peaceable old hippy. In reality he is a short-fused extremist seeking to profit by creating division.</p>
      <p>Witness his absurd caricature of our “society of billionaires and the very poor” where housing is merely “a speculation opportunity for dodgy landlords and the wealthy few”.</p>
      <p>How do home-owners, perhaps in our most deprived towns and cities, feel about this class-war poser — this Islington millionaire raised in a country manor — revoltingly branding THEM “the wealthy few”?</p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon is ready to help him set up shop in No10. But does she really want to be tied to him? Is the desperation to drive the Tories out and the hunger for IndyRef2 worth this alliance?</p>
      <p>More importantly, she has witnessed the carnage that can happen when political rivals team up. Indeed, the SNP benefitted from it in the months after the Better Together campaign won out in the first independence referendum.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, Labour’s manifesto will be launched in Birmingham 40 years to the day since the pub bombings there in which 21 were slaughtered by the IRA Corbyn supported.</p>
      <p>How does he have the nerve?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ignore his bribes and lies. Never forget who he is and what he truly believes.</b>

      <h3>Prince’s shame</h3>
      <p>
        <b>FINALLY Prince Andrew does the right thing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not that he had much choice but to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4977246/prince-andrew-announces-he-is-stepping-back-from-royal-duties-over-epstein-scandal/">cease all duties</a> and wait for a knock from the police or FBI.</p>
      <p>He is a busted flush as a Royal and has brought the Family its gravest crisis in years.</p>
      <p>His statement is a desperate attempt to fix the disastrous failures of his TV interview over the Epstein paedophile scandal.</p>
      <p>But if Andrew thinks this will draw a line under it he is delusional.</p>
      <p>
        <b>We fear his woes are just beginning.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Stand aside</h3>
      <p>
        <b>HEALTH Secretary Jeane Freeman issued a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/politics/4977303/jeane-freeman-apologises-glasgow-superhospital-death-scandal-children/">grovelling apology</a> over Glasgow’s super-hospital water contamination scandal yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s the least she could do. Especially after admitting up to 150 children may have been affected.</p>
      <p>Two desperately ill kids have died.</p>
      <p>Taking action against the hapless NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is a step in the right direction.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Standing aside herself to allow stronger leadership would be better.</b>
