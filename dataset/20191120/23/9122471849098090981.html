      <h1>LSU Releases Chapter 2 Of Its “That’s Joe” Series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:24:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>As part of their campaign to get star quarterback Joe Burrow Heisman Trophy votes, LSU has been putting together a mini-series outlining how he got to where he is now.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Tigers released Chapter 1 of their “That’s Joe” series. And today they’ve released Chapter 2.</p>
      <p>You can watch the video here:</p>

      <p>Burrow has put up historic numbers for the Tigers in his second and final year in Baton Rouge.</p>
      <p>With two games plus a postseason still to play, Burrow already has a school-record 3,687 passing yards and 38 touchdowns – all while completing a nation-leading 78.6-percent of his passes.</p>
      <p>On top of setting all of those records at LSU, he is on pace to break all of the same records in the Southeastern Conference.</p>
      <p>It’s certainly been a historic year for Burrow. Whether or not it culminates in a national title or even an SEC title remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>But the Tigers are working around the clock to ensure that his last season with them ends in a Heisman Trophy title.</p>
