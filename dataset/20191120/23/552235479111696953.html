      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Keith Jackson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/keith-jackson/</a></address>
      <p>Rangers are edging closer to offering <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a>’s nephew the chance to follow in his famous uncle’s footsteps at Ibrox.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>can reveal 18-year-old Cameron Gascoigne has returned to Glasgow for a second trial after impressing during a training stint at the club’s Auchenhowie HQ earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Gascoigne scored against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/partick-thistle-fc">Partick Thistle</a> in a 3-0 win for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> development squad on Tuesday night and sources believe the youngster could now be offered a full time deal to move north of the border after being released by Newcsastle in the summer.</p>
      <p><i><b>MailSport</b> </i>revealed on Sunday that the striker would be invited to train at the club, with English clubs also monitoring the prolific youngster.</p>
      <p>Paul Gascoigne is a legendary figure at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ibrox-stadium">Ibrox</a> after spending the best part of three seasons in Govan.</p>
      <p>The midfielder won two SPL titles as part of the nine-in-a-row team and scored 39 goals for Rangers in that time.</p>
      <p>Gazza also won the League Cup and Scottish Cup in 1995-96 as part of a domestic treble.</p>
