      <p>Update 11/20/2019 11:25pm:</p>
      <p>News of Roc-A-Fella co-founder Dame Dash being arrested due to unpaid child support swept across the blogosphere. Needless to say, the narrative painted Dame in an unfavorable light prompting him to reclaim the story and tell it from his perspective. </p>
      <p>In a video shared on IG, Dame shows himself interacting with members of the media outside an NYC courthouse. During the exchange Dame mentions that the entire narrative of him being arrested is overblown considering that he told reporters, "I went to turn myself in with money." </p>

      <p>According to TMZ, hip-hop mogul Damon Dash has been arrested as a result of unpaid child support. Fortunate for Dash, he was quickly released after being apprehended. He was picked up by authorities in New York City after trying to clear two of the warrants associated with his child support. </p>
      <p>Dame says he was able to take care of one warrant in Manhattan but while en route to the other courthouse to take care of the second warrant, 7 deputies arrested Dash. TMZ reports Dash had to fork over a million dollars to clear the debt after being taken into police custody. </p>
