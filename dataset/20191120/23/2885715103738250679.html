      <p>The Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association (JUTA) on Wednesday strongly condemned police lathicharge on JNU students two days earlier.</p>
      <p>“We condemn the attack by Delhi Police against the agitating JNU students on November 18, 2019, during a march to Parliament to demand roll back of the massive fee hike. The teachers too were not spared the brutal assault. JUTA notes with deep concern that the way the JNU administration unilaterally tried to impose the fee hike without consulting the stake holders has violated the spirit of autonomy of the university,” JUTA said in a statement.<br/>JUTA general secretary Partha Pratim Ray criticised the JNU administration for refusing to initiate dialogue with the students and denying the elected students’ union to act as a legitimate voice.</p>
      <p>“This is a gross violation of democratic principle and practices. In this context, JUTA expresses its solidarity with the students of JNU for their struggle against the policy of commercialisation of education by the government in the form of new policy,” said Ray.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, teachers at the university skipped classes for the second consecutive day, as part of their two-day strike against partial implementation of the latest revised pay scale recommended by the University Grants Commission (UGC).</p>
      <p>The JUTA and other college and university teachers’ associations had written to CM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mamata-banerjee">Mamata Banerjee</a> on November 6, requesting for the effective implementation of the new pay scale from January 1, 2016 instead of January 1, 2020, as announced by her earlier this month. The teachers have been also demanding cancellation of the draft National Educational Policy, 2019.</p>
