      <p>The Forest Department detained five residents of a tribal settlement near Pollachi for felling sandalwood trees from a core areas of the Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) and damaging a pair of cameras, placed to monitor tiger movement.</p>
      <p>The men had removed the cameras that were fixed onto trees, and thrown them into the bushes, as the sensor-based devices detected their movement and emitted flash.</p>
      <p>Those detained were identified as T. Manian, 39, K. Usilimani aka Kaliappan, 35, N. Senthil, 45, V. Ayyappan, 39, and V. Sullan aka Kaliappan, 30 — all residents of the Thammampathi tribal settlement.</p>
      <p>They had ventured into Ayirangaal beat of the Pollachi forest range and axed two sandalwood trees about a week ago.</p>
      <p>Field staff of the Department, on a patrol in the area, found the cameras missing and informed higher officials.</p>
      <p>A team of the Department, led by A. Kasilingam, forest range officer, Pollachi forest range, conducted an investigation, and found that a few men from the Thammampathi tribal settlement had ventured into forest areas of the Ayirangaal beat.</p>
      <p>Manian and Usilimani were picked up initially and they confessed to the offence.</p>
      <p>Others were taken into custody subsequently.</p>
      <p>“We have seized 30 kg of sandalwood from the five men, and have managed to recover a camera that they had thrown into the bushes. We are yet to trace the second camera,” said Mr. Kasilingam.</p>
      <p>A.S. Marimuthu, deputy field director of ATR and district forest officer of Pollachi forest division, said several pairs of camera traps were placed at strategic locations in the ATR to monitor tigers.</p>
