      <h1>Basketball Wives Star Kristen Scott Feels Bad About The Way OG Chijindu Was Treated But Doesn’t Think It Had Anything To Do With Colorism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:55:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:55</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>The last season of Basketball Wives caused controversy for something it never has before: colorism. Kristen Scott recently completed a podcast interview where she gave her honest opinion.</p>
      <p>OG Chijindu got into multiple arguments with the women of the cast. She was forced to sit out the final lunch during filming and tape the reunion show in a separate area because she was deemed ‘too aggressive.’</p>
      <p>Because many of the women on the show have a history of violence, <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/shaunie-oneal-says-that-basketball-wives-has-been-renewed-and-reveals-if-og-has-been-fired-supported-by-shaq-in-new-video-327201/">viewers and OG felt that she was treated differently</a> due to the color of her skin.</p>
      <p>Shaunie O’Neal and Evelyn Lozada are of a lighter skin tone but Kristen, who is of a darker tone, also didn’t get along with the former football player.</p>
      <p>While speaking on Melyssa Ford’s podcast called I’m Here for the Food, Scott explained: ‘For me, I’m clearly the same damn color. I mean, I feel like I’m the same color as OG. I’m not getting that treatment so it’s hard for me to agree that it’s because of her skin color. It makes it very difficult for me to agree that this is colorism when I’m the same color.’</p>
      <p>She went on to say that the issue may have actually been bullying.</p>

      <p>‘It looks like mean girls, it looks like bullying — I hate using that for grown a– women but that’s the word that gets thrown around. I get it. Do I think that things happened unintentionally that we do? Yeah. When you look back at yourself I’m sure you’re like ‘F***, that’s not what I meant to do,’ but [Evelyn and Shaunie are] two grown a– women that I can’t speak for. I can only speak for me and what I had with [OG]. I have done a lot of apologizing for a lot of my bad behavior on this show. You saw and you haven’t. I really tried to be somebody who owns my sh-t, I really do. When you watch OG and she says, ‘I don’t regret anything,’ there’s no accountability.’</p>
      <p>She went on to say that she does regret how OG was treated.</p>
      <p>How do you feel about her comments?</p>
