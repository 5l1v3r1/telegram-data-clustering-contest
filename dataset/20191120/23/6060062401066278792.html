      <h1>People have noticed WeWork's 'sad' empty booth at a big software developer conference</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:08:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/julie-bort" target="_blank">Julie Bort</a></address>

        <li>About 12,000 attendees descended on San Diego this week to attend KubeCon, a software conference dedicated to the hot programming technology <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-kubernetes-google-cloud-2019-1">known as Kubernetes</a>.</li>
        <li>But, it turns out, one tiny, vacant booth has captured people's attention.</li>
        <li>WeWork had a booth at the show — but attendees posted to Twitter over the course of the day that the booth was, seemingly, unattended.</li>
        <li>WeWork declined to comment.</li>

      <p>WeWork is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wework-chairman-tells-employees-layoffs-will-begin-this-week-2019-11">in the process of massive layoffs this week</a> as the company restructures after its failed attempt at an IPO.</p>
      <p>When WeWork released the paperwork for the intended IPO, the company tried to position itself as a tech company rather than a real estate company. Since WeWork makes its money renting shared office space, not software, investors and pundits <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/08/no-wework-isnt-a-tech-company-heres-why-that-matters">universally rejected that idea. </a></p>
      <p>But WeWork did pursue all kinds of tech projects, under the auspices of now-ousted CEO Adam Neumann. The company had big hopes to offer its tenants various software apps, and at one point<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519244329/d804478ds1a.htm"> said it </a>employed 1,000 engineers, product designers and machine learning specialists. It even wrote about its technology <a href="https://engineering.wework.com/">choices from time to time on Medium</a>.</p>
      <p>That might explain why WeWork had a tiny booth at KubeCon, a big conference held in San Diego this week around Kubernetes, a Google-created open source software project that's become something of a standard in the cloud computing industry. The conference has an estimated attendance of 12,000.</p>
      <p>WeWork was known to be a user of Kubernetes — or, at least, it was interested in hiring people who knew how to use it. A recent WeWork engineering job posting listed Kubernetes as a "nice to have" skill, among a <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/senior-full-stack-engineer-growth-tech-wework-JV_IC1147401_KO0,38_KE39,45.htm?jl=3410234361&amp;ctt=1574277685829&amp;srs=EI_JOBS">boatload of other trendy technologies</a>.</p>
      <p>Whether the purpose of the booth was to recruit developers, or to try and nab startups to rent WeWork office space, we may never know — because the booth was, apparently, un-staffed for much of the event. </p>
      <p>The sight of the empty booth was viewed as a symbol for the struggling company by more than one KubeCon attendee, who posted pictures of it on Twitter over the course of the day. One described the sight as "sad." </p>
