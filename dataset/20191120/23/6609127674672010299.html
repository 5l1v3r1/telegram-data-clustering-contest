        <figcaption>The telly wrestler and his Pinnochio panto cast will appear in store next week</figcaption>

      <p>And they will all help raise vital funds for our chosen charities MND Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland.</p>
      <p>Pavilion Theatre manager Iain Gordon — who also donated a family ticket for his show’s opening night — said: “The panto cast are delighted to support The Scottish Sun charity shop for a fourth year in a row.</p>
      <p>“They always look forward to being in store to help raise money for such good causes.”</p>
      <p>And this year our Sunta store — which opens next Wednesday — is going to be more amazing than ever after Amazon dropped off an incredible £5,000 worth of goodies.</p>
      <p>David Freeman, General Manager at Amazon’s Development Centre in Scotland, said: “Amazon is thrilled to support the Scottish Sun’s Christmas Charity Shop for the second year in a row.</p>
      <p>“The Sunta Store is always a fun event where shoppers can grab some great bargains and spread the magic of Christmas while raising money for good causes.</p>

      <p>“And The Scottish Sun’s chosen charities, MND Scotland and Alzheimers Scotland, carry out important work for individuals and families across the country.</p>
      <p>“We hope our donation of £5,000 worth of Amazon electronics, sports equipment and other gifts goes a long way to raising much needed funds to give people help and hope at this time of year.”</p>
      <p>The incredible gifts include sought after electrical goodies including 4k Ultra HD Fire Sticks, Echo Show with Alexa, Echo Dots and new Fire TV Cube video streaming gizmos.</p>
      <p>But Amazon is not the only company who have really stepped up to the plate for our Sunta store.</p>

      <p>“We also have bottles of whisky, wine and gin to win which will make an ideal gift for someone to find under their Christmas tree.</p>
