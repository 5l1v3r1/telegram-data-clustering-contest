      <p>Mr Yeung, a Hong Kong resident, is said to have <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/hong-kong-protests-alex-yeung-singapore-investigation-12072836">organised a gathering on Oct 11</a> "for interested persons to share their views on the current protests in Hong Kong". </p>
      <p>The Singapore Police Force (SPF) said on Nov 7 that Mr Yeung's passport had been impounded while he was assisting with its investigation into the event. </p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the police said it has issued a "stern warning" to Mr Yeung for organising a public assembly without the requisite police permit, an offence under the Public Order Act.</p>
      <p>A similar warning was issued to a 55-year-old naturalised Singaporean for facilitating the public assembly. </p>
      <p>The police said “there have been calls" for Singapore to release Mr Yeung and take no further action against him. </p>
      <p>"Singapore has always been clear that foreigners should not advocate their political causes in Singapore, through public assemblies, and other prohibited means," SPF said. </p>
      <p>"The police investigated Yeung’s case in accordance with our usual processes and in accordance with our laws.”</p>

      <p>The Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong has been embroiled in anti-government unrest for nearly six months, after what started as rallies against a now-dead extradition Bill erupted into a wider movement calling for greater freedoms and police accountability. </p>
      <p>Mr Yeung said in a YouTube video posted in early November he had planned to stay in Singapore from Oct 10 to 12 to seek business opportunities.</p>
