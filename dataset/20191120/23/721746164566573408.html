      <h1>League of Legends’ preseason support item changes, explained</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:03:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.polygon.com/users/Austen%20Goslin" target="_blank">Austen Goslin</a></address>
      <p>Support items are always tough to get right in <i>League of Legends</i>. Make them too strong, and suddenly everybody in the game buys them, too weak and supports will struggle to be useful. In the latest preseason, Riot took another shot at the support item lines to see if it could get them just right.</p>
      <p>To help you make sense of the dozens of changes that came along with this year’s preseason patch, we’re here to tell you everything you need to know about <i>League of Legends</i> new support items.</p>
      <h3>Items upgrade differently now</h3>
      <p>Instead of purchasing upgrades for your support items, like you would have in the past, support items now upgrade on their own. Each of the items still has three tiers and will have to upgrade to each one. The first tier of the items will all cost 400 gold. Tier 2 will include three wards and give a slight upgrade to the unique gold-generating passive. Tier 3 will include four wards, and the unique passive will go away.</p>
      <h3>Why wouldn’t everyone buy this?</h3>
      <p>To stop solo laners from poaching the new support items, Riot has instituted its strictest rule ever. If you have a support item and get more than 20 CS per five minutes, the gold you get from killing minions will be reduced by 50%. If you get 50 minions in five minutes you’ll get a reduction of 80%. This makes taking these items a pretty terrible deal for a solo laner or even and ADC, no matter how strong the items themselves are.</p>
