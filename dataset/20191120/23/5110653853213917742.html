      <h3>Fantasy Football Trade Candidates: Stock up</h3>
      <p><b>Deebo Samuel, WR SF:</b>Samuel has now produced back-to-back weeks of 19 or more fantasy points. He has at least eight fantasy points in four straight games, and he has averaged 15.6 fantasy points per game in that span. What you really love about these past two games in particular is that he has racked up 11 and 10 targets, respectively, while hauling in eight receptions in both. He also crossed the 100-yard mark in both games, as well. I loved this rookie coming into the seasonand it's nice to see him producing, but there are a few things to keep in mind before getting too excited. The 49ers have been withoutGeorge Kittle (knee) and either without or with a compromised Emmanuel Sanders (ribs) in each of the past two games. They faced two poor secondaries in each of those games, as well, in the Seahawks and Cardinals. He is very unlikely to continue to produce at this rate moving forward. That being said, he has formed a nice chemistry with Jimmy G and will likely be a solid fantasy asset moving forward, even if he isn't as high-end as he has looked over the past two games.</p>
      <p><b>Ryan Griffin, TE NYJ:</b>Griffin has really developed a great chemistry withSam Darnoldover the past few weeks, and with Chris Herndon done for the year, Griffinis starting to be a pretty strong fantasy asset. Over the past four games he has three double-digit fantasy point outings and has two games with more than 20 points. In that span, he has hauled in 16-of-18 targets and has at least targets in three of those games. He had his first 100-yard game of the season in the Jets' 34-17 win over the Redskins in Week 11. This isn't to say that he has moved into weekly starter territory, but he has shown enough that we can feel comfortable streaming him and/or giving him a look for GPPs for our DFS action. His next three matchups are against the Raiders, Bengals, and Dolphins, so he can be looked at as a back-end TE1 for that stretch of games.</p>

      <h3>Fantasy Football Trade Candidates: Stock down</h3>
      <p><b>Kyle Allen, QB CAR:</b>The magic appears to have run out for Allen. He was a complete disaster this week against the Falcons, throwing 50 passes for 325 yards, zero touchdowns, and four interceptions. He now has nine interceptions over the past four games with just three touchdowns in that span. Yikes. Unsurprisingly, the Panthers have also fallen apart in that stretch, winning just one game. He hasn't scored more than 16 fantasy points in any of the past four games, and he has been in single digits in two of them. He is going to have a tough time bouncing back in Week 12, too, as the Panthers head to New Orleans to take on the Saints. He can be cut loose in most formats at this point and streamers can find a better option.</p>
      <p><b>Nelson Agholor, WR PHI:</b>Agholor was thrust into the spotlight asthe Eagles' No. 1 receiver this week with both Alshon Jeffery and DeSean Jackson out of action, but he disappointed (per usual). He just isn't a good player, plain and simple. He drops way too many easy passes and struggles with contested ones, as well. He racked up nine targetsbut only managed to haul in four of them for a whopping 40 yards for an eight-point fantasy effort in PPR leagues. Sure, the matchup wasn't great, but this was now his seventh straight game with fewer than 10 fantasy pointsdespite three games in that span with at least seven targets. He does have a better matchup on tap in Week 12 against the Seahawks, but it's tough to put much faith in him at this point.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Tevin Coleman, RB SF:</b>Coleman had a fantastic run in Weeks 5-8, but he has done a complete 180 over the past three games. We did not expect him to continue elite production, but it's a bit surprising to now see him not even putting up starter level production. He finished with 12 carries for 14 yards in the 49ers win this week. He also hauled in three passes for 48 yards to make it a 9.2-point day in PPR leagues. It was his second game under 10 points in the past three weeks, and he hasn't reached 12 points in any of those games. WithMatt Breida(ankle) out this week, it seemed like Coleman was set up to snap out of his funk, but that just wasn't the case. He has a strong matchup in Week 12 against Green Bay, so fantasy owners will be hopeful for a breakout game. It is important to keep in mind that he has rough matchups against the Ravens and Saints after the Packers, though. He is trending downward and quick.</p>
      <p><b>O.J. Howard, TE TB:</b>I warned everyone to not get too excited about Howard after his decent game against the Cardinalsin what is the best matchup in the league for tight ends. While I wasn't expecting much from him against the Saints, he was even worse than I expected. He dropped his lone target and managed to turn it into an interception by letting it bounce all around his body for a few seconds before a Saints player was able to pluck it out of the air. He was then benched. He had to sit and watch asCameron Bratehauled in 10-of-14 targets for 73 yards in the Bucs loss. If for some reason you haven't dropped Howard yet... what are you waiting for? He is the biggest bust of the year at the position, and second place isn't remotely close. Go ahead and get him off your team.</p>

      <h3>Fantasy Football Stock Watch</h3>
      <p><b>Bo Scarbrough, RB DET:</b>Scarbrough was the starting running back for the Lions out of nowhere after being promoted from the practice squad the day before the game. He rushed 14 times for 55 yards and a touchdown in the Lions' 35-27 loss to the Cowboys. He proved to be the physical rusher that the Lions offense had been lacking, andhe immediately becomes an interesting player for standard leagues. Unfortunately standard leagues are where the interest ends, as he did not catch a single pass, and even with the strong game he finished with just 11.5 points in PPR formats. That being said, he does have a great matchup with the Redskins on tap this week, and it wouldn't be shocking to see him find the end zone for a second straight week.</p>
      <p><b>Patrick Laird, RB MIA:</b>Laird had just one carry for seven yards in the Dolphins' loss to the Bills, but he made his money in the passing attack with six receptions for 51 yards on six targets. That was good enough for 11.8 PPR fantasy points, which was very similar to the number that Kalen Ballage scored. I've been saying this for weeks now, but Ballage is the worst running back in football. He had nine carries for nine yards and managed just eight yards on five receptions. This dude is terrible. I don't even know how he's still on the team, let alone starting. I digress. It appears that Laird has worked his way into a role, and Miami would be smart to give him more touches and to stop shooting themselves in the foot by giving the ball to Ballage. PPR leaguers can give Laird a look.</p>
      <p><b>Jeff Driskel, QB DET:</b>Two weeks of Driskel, two weeks of people using the defense against him in DFS and failing. However, for me, it's been two weeks of using Driskel in DFS and making money. Driskel is nowhere near as bad as people seem to think he is, and he is actually looking like a solid quarterback to use for seasonal fantasy purposes. His first start came against a decent Bears defense, and he managed to rack up 19 fantasy points. His second start came against a very solid Dallas defense, and he managed to score 27.5 fantasy points. He has two weeks as a starting quarterback, two weeks as a top-four finisher at the position. He has a nice blend of running and passing which has allowed him to score points in a variety of ways, as evidenced by his 13 carries for 88 rushing yards and a touchdown through two games. Now, in Week 12, he will get to face a Redskins defense that hasn't been able to stop anyone. He will rank as a top-10 fantasy option at the position for me this week.</p>
