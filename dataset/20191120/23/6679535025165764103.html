      <h1>These toilets are far from satisfactory</h1>
      <h2>Row toilets, built under Swachh Bharat Mission, remain unused in a Dindigul village</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:35:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/A-Shrikumar-532/" target="_blank">A. Shrikumar</a></address>
      <p>R. Vijaya of Pithalaipatti village under Athoor union got an incentive of ₹12,000 under Swachh Bharat Mission for building a toilet. However, the space in front of her house was not sufficient to build the toilet. Not just for her but few other villagers also faced the same problem.</p>
      <p>So the panchayat built a block of 10 to 12 toilets for such individual users on a poromboke land away from their dwellings. The keys of the respective toilets were handed over to the beneficiaries. However, the row toilets are now lying in tatters, with the doors broken and the roof vandalised. The toilets have become defunct and are filled with wildgrowth, making it unfit for use.</p>
      <p>The reason is that the beneficiaries have stopped using the toilets regularly. One, because they have to walk a few hundred metres every time to relieve themselves as the row toilets are located far away, near a graveyard. Second, there’s no lighting and water facilities.</p>
      <p>“After dusk, I find it unsafe to walk to the toilet, as there’s an open well on the way. The place has already become a den for anti-social elements. We have to carry a bucket of water and a torch from home as there are no taps and lights. This has forced us to stop using it,” said Ms.Vijaya.</p>
      <p>It is the same story with all the beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>The villagers say that as per norms under the scheme, the row toilets have to be built either 100 metres or a maximum of 200 metres from the dwellings, but in most cases, they are built away from the houses.</p>
      <p>A district-level officer of Swachh Bharat Mission says so far 1.60 lakh toilets have been constructed across the district and all villages declared open defecation-free. “As per norms, we build a 500 litre water tank and provide a common tap for all toilets. In some panchayats, separate taps have been provided inside every toilet,” he says.</p>
      <h3>“Not the distance”</h3>
      <p>The officials feel that it’s more to do with awareness and not the distance. “In many villages, people walk longer distances to defecate in the open. The problem behind them not using the toilets is lack of awareness,” they say.</p>
      <p>To encourage people to use the toilets, every panchayat has been provided with two motivators, who go around giving talks. The functioning of the toilets are monitored by a block-level swachh police.</p>
      <p>“Lighting and lack of water facilities will be looked into and action will be taken,” said the official.</p>
