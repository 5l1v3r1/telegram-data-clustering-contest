      <p>An idea which started from a simple Facebook post has seen a Ballarat woman collect thousands of dollars worth of goods which will all go to bushfire decimated communities.</p>
      <p>Grace Beechey and her father Geoff will fill a truck load of goods this weekend and head on the 10-hour trek to Lithgow to deliver hundreds of packages to communities in need.</p>
      <p>"My grandparents live in Gol Gol near Mildura and there wasn't anything really we could donate to," Ms Beechey said.</p>
      <p>"I rang the Red Cross and all they wanted was money, but we wanted to do something that can help people right away.</p>
      <p>"We've got everything from toiletry sets, clothes and food. I thought I'd do a little bit but it's ended up massive."</p>
      <p>Ms Beechey said donations were still being taken until Thursday night when she and her father will start loading the truck for the trip north.</p>
      <p>"It's only been a week and it's been insane," she said.</p>
      <p>"We'll finish at Thursday at 4pm, so we can start putting boxes on the truck, we had to put a stop somewhere.</p>
      <p>"It's so important and especially because it's so close to home. It could happen to us, so I think it's important we do our bit for the community."</p>
      <p>If you have any donations you'd like to make to Grace, you can drop them off at Rotork 416 Dowling Street, Wendouree until Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>You can also private message Ms Beechey on her Facebook page.</p>
