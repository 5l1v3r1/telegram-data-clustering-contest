      <h1>Week 12 Fantasy PPR Rankings: Tight end</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:37:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:37</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>We're again dealing witha very standard-looking PPR tight end rankings list for Week 12, so let's talk about Gerald Everett for a second. Sunday Night Football should've been a national TV breakout for Everetteven though it was against the Bears. Brandin Cooks and Robert Woods were both out. Everett had seen 12 targets a week ago. Yet somehow the Rams only looked Everett's way once. Not in a good way, his fantasy value feels a lot like Eric Ebron's.</p>
      <p>Everett will remain a top-10 TE momst weeks due to injuries at the position, but an L.A. offense that promised such potency has been anything but. Dropping Everett if he's your best tight end would be ill advised, but he still is more matchup-dependent than we wanted to think a week ago.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It's worth noting as you look at the rankings below that we're ranking George Kittle to start the week, although he could miss out due to a knee injury and vault Ross Dwelley into relevance. However, we aren't ranking Evan Engram due to a foot injury to begin the week. The rankings are also without Travis Kelce, Hunter Henry, Irv Smith Jr., and Kyle Rudolph due to Week 12 byes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you're struggling at the position for this week, Jacob Hollister is our favorite waiver wire option. In the four weeks before Seattle's bye, he saw a combined 24 targets, catching three touchdowns in his previous two games. He might have Will Dissly-level consistency the rest of the way with an MVP-level quarterback. You could also go and add Noah Fant after his 11 targets in Week 11 -- maybe he'll get 12 in Week 12.</p>

      <p>It's also that time of year where some fantasy owners get really desperate for a spark to make the playoffs. Not that we'd necessarily recommend either of these two guys, but Jaeden Graham and Luke Stocker take on the Buccaneers this week. Tampa Bay is like the lite version of the Cardinals when it comes to getting torched by TEs. It's hard to even say which of the Atlanta guys is more likely to do something due to very limited usage and sample size in Week 11,but Graham is probably the more talented receiver and has better hair.</p>
