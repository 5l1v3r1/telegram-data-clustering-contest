      <p>Fuming Ian Wright exploded tonight in a foul-mouthed meltdown at his fellow I'm A Celebrity campmates.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb viewers were shocked with the former footballer's angry reaction to being offered extra crocodile feet.</p>
      <p>Just hours before, Ian confessed he was on the brink of leaving the jungle because he was struggling with the lack of food.</p>
      <p>So it came as a massive surprise when he started swearing at Andrew Maxwell, telling the comedian he didn't want anymore "f***ing crocodile".</p>
      <p>Ian was labelled a 'drama queen' and 'diva' by viewers who condemned his rude behaviour.</p>

      <p>Ian was in a happy mood as he teased Kate Garraway by trying to high five the GMB presenter with a crocodile claw.</p>
      <p>But there was a tense atmosphere in camp when Ian refused to accept another croc foot when offered by Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Ian said: "I don't want no more. I really honestly don't want no more."</p>

      <p>Andrew and Jacqueline insisted he could have another one as James Haskell had already had more.</p>
      <p>When Ian refused again, frustrated Andrew said: "Oh Jesus the drama."</p>
      <p>Losing his rag, Ian replied: "I said I don't want anymore f***ing crocodile bruv. I don't want no more."</p>

      <p>In the Bush Telegraph, he said: "There's nothing more frustrating than when you say no to something and someone continues to ask you. It's annoying."</p>
      <p>Kate admitted it had been a "hard day" for everyone in camp, while Jacqueline said people were getting more "agitated" and were "at logger heads".</p>
      <p>Could Ian be the first campmate to crack and leave?</p>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity viewers took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to slam Ian for his antics.</p>
      <p>One viewer said: "Solid conclusion after tonight’s episode.. Ian is a bit of a d*** really, complains about not eating enough, complains when they get a decent meal"</p>
      <p>"Someone get Ian a snickers , quick #diva #hungry," added another.</p>
      <p>A third said: "Had Ian Wright down as the winner in the beginning, not anymore, turns out he’s a bit of a moaner"</p>
      <p>"Ian Wright is such a f***ing drama queen! Whinge whinge whinge about being hungry blah blah and someone offers him seconds and he gets all bent outta shape? Idiot!," said a fourth.</p>
