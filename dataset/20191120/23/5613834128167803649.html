      <p>Paramount Pictures has picked up the rights to <b>Jonathan Behr</b>‘s short film, <b><i>The Follower</i></b>, and the accompanying pitch by screenwriter <b>Aaron W. Sala</b>, writes <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/paramount-picks-up-creepy-short-film-follower-1256740">THR</a>.</p>
      <p>Behr’s short film tells the story of a young babysitter who is being mysteriously followed through her various devices. Part of the creepy story is told via the devices. The feature version will have the same set-up but focus on the young woman’s attempt to turn the table on her would-be stalker, adds the site.</p>
      <p>Brad Fuller and Andrew Form, who produced horror hit <i>A Quiet Place, The Purge, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street </i>and several other horror properties with Michael Bay, are producing via their label, Fully Formed, which has a first-look deal at the studio.</p>
      <p>Here’s a trailer for Behr’s short film, which is similar to several other tech films in the past few years from <i>Keep Watching</i> to <i>Unfriended Dark Web</i>.</p>
