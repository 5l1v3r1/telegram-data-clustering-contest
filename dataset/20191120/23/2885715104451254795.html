      <p>Five unidentified men attacked a delivery staffer of a courier firm in a moving Kutch Express train between Valsad and Dungri railway stations on Tuesday night and made away with his bag containing cash and gold worth around Rs 50 lakh, police said.</p>
      <p>According to police, Praveen Rajput, a resident of Gayetri building on M G Road in Vaslad who works as a delivery man with Amrut Kantilal, a local courier company, was on way to the head office in Surat by train. The train reached Valsad railway station around 8.30 pm and slowed down near the Kakri railway crossing after around eight minutes, when five youths entered the general coach and tried to snatch Praveen’s bag. Other passengers did not interfere seeing the country-made pistol with the robbers.</p>
      <p>When Praveen resisted the attack, one of the youths hit his head with the butt of the pistol. Another one then pulled the chain and all of them escaped from the train with the bag. The exact amount of the valuables is not known but it is estimated to be between Rs 40 and Rs 50 lakh, police said.</p>
      <p>The train halted at Navsari Railway station, where Praveen informed the RPF (Railway Police Force) and GRP (Government Railway Police) about the incident. Praveen was bleeding from his head and was rushed to a private hospital in Navsari.</p>
      <p>The GRP of Navsari, Surat and Valsad were put on alert after the incident. A police team from Valsad took Praveen’s statements late on Tuesday and lodged a complaint of robbery against the five unidentified accused.</p>
      <p>The Railway police are also checking the courier firm’s records to find out the number of stolen parcels and to verify the items. A police team also reached the Kakri railway crossing and carried out a search operation at night but did not get any breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Railway Local Crime Branch sub-inspector, NM Talati, said, “We suspect that the accused might have been watching Praveen’s daily movements and fixed him as a target. They might have been following him from his office in Valsad itself. We also suspect that somebody inside the angadia firm may have given information to the robbers about him carrying cash and gold to the head office in Surat. Praveen got two stitches on his head and is stable.”</p>
