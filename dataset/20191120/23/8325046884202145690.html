        <li>The 2020 Democratic primary field is one of the most diverse in history in terms of age.</li>
        <li>Mayor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-pete-buttigieg-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Pete Buttigieg</a>, 37, and Rep. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-tulsi-gabbard-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, 38, are attempting to overtake Teddy Roosevelt’s status as America’s youngest president.</li>
        <li>President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> holds the title of oldest US president on his first Inauguration Day, taking office at 70 years and 220 days old.

      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Joe Biden</a> turned 77 on November 20.</p>
      <p>Biden, who served as a county executive in Delaware in 1970 before being elected to the Senate in 1972, has been in elected office longer than eight of his fellow Democratic primary contenders have been alive.</p>
      <p>The 2020 field is one of the most diverse in history in terms of age, which has become a focal point for 2020 Democrats. Mayor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-pete-buttigieg-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Pete Buttigieg</a>, 37, for example, is partially centering his campaign on the theme of intergenerational justice, arguing a new generation of leadership can solve the problems facing America.</p>
      <p>The US Constitution mandates that a candidate must be at least 35 to be eligible for the presidency. The youngest-ever president was Theodore Roosevelt, who took office at 42 years and 322 days old in 1901.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg, 37, and Rep. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-tulsi-gabbard-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Tulsi Gabbard</a>, 38, are attempting to overtake Roosevelt’s record as America’s youngest president.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump holds the title of oldest president at the time of his first election, taking office at 70 years and 220 days old.</p>
      <p>But three of the top candidates in the Democratic primary field could break his record.</p>
      <p>Biden, Sen. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-bernie-sanders-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Bernie Sanders</a>, and Sen. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-elizabeth-warren-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Elizabeth Warren</a> would be the oldest presidents ever on their first Inauguration Day if elected, hypothetically taking office at ages 78, 79, and 71.</p>
