      <p>WASHINGTON (CN) – On the heels of blockbuster testimony by President Donald Trump’s handpicked ambassador confirming a “quid pro quo,” a Pentagon official who oversees military assistance sprang forward on Wednesday afternoon with another damaging revelation.</p>
      <p>The same day of Trump’s call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, the former Soviet satellite learned there may have been a problem with the lethal aid it had been counting on in its war with the Russians.</p>
      <p>“In a series of interagency meetings, I heard that the president had directed the Office of Management and Budget to hold the funds because of his concerns about corruption in Ukraine,” Laura Cooper, the Pentagon official overseeing military aid, testified in her opening statement.</p>
      <p>“Let me say from the outset that I have never discussed this or any other matter with the president and never heard directly from him about this matter,” Cooper added.</p>

      </p>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff’s opening statement set the stage for a late August meeting between Cooper and Ambassador Kurt Volker, who <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/trump-given-no-favors-from-gop-invite-in-impeachment-probe/">surprised many on Tuesday</a> as the Republican-called witness extoled former Vice President Joe Biden and reversed his earlier testimony on the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.</p>
      <p>“During that meeting, in which they were discussing the hold on security assistance, Volker revealed that he was engaged in an effort to have the government of Ukraine issue a statement that would ‘commit to the prosecution of any individuals involved in election interference,’” Schiff remarked in his opening statement. “Cooper understood that if Volker’s effort were successful, the hold might be lifted.”</p>
      <p>The chairman continued: “Unbeknownst to Cooper, no such statement was forthcoming.”</p>
      <p>David Hale, the third-highest ranking official at the State Department, agreed with an oft-repeated characterization during hearings, that placing a hold on military aid in order to leverage assistance from a foreign country to investigate a political opponent would be considered “unusual.”</p>
      <p>But when pressed over whether it would be “completely inappropriate,” Hale went a step further.</p>
      <p>“It would be inconsistent with the conduct of our foreign policy,” Hale said.</p>
