        <b>Gemma Collins and Holly Willoughby made sure to stay cosy for the opening of everyone’s favourite Winter Wonderland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The stars both wore some form of red as they joined a host of celebrities for the fun of Christmas rides and mulled wine.</p>
      <p>Gemma arrived at the event wearing a black outfit and accessorised it with a bright red scarf and beret.</p>
      <p>The reality star was probably hard to miss in the crowd being that bright but as it’s almost Christmas, red and green is the way to go.</p>
      <p>TV host Holly went for similar tones as she posed in a black coat and kept warm with a casual burgundy beanie.</p>
      <p>The This Morning presenter seems to be keeping to a Christmas theme recently as she was seen at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/holly-willoughby-looks-cool-ice-joins-lily-allen-stacey-solomon-frozen-2-premiere-11172506/">Frozen 2 premiere</a> this week, and then slipped into a festive jumper to lend her support to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/holly-willoughby-james-blunt-and-ed-balls-slip-into-something-festive-in-support-of-christmas-jumper-day-2019-11177215/">Save The Children’s Christmas Jumper Day</a>.</p>

      <p>Both were joined by a roomful of celebs including Love Island’s Amber Gill, Ovie Soko, TV host Caroline Flack and BBC Radio 1 host Nick Grimshaw.</p>

      <p>Ovie was apparently inspired by mulled wine while layering up for the event.</p>
      <p>The star and basketball player rocked a white jumper with a red Carhartt jumper on top. He finished the look off with a denim jacket, gold chains, red-tinted sunglasses and a red beanie. Did we mention red?</p>
      <p>We’re only mildly jealous that they got to experience the amazing rides and festive drinks before we do, but we only have a few more hours to wait.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, everyone just has to go to bed while the Love Island crew and other celebs go on the Munich Looping rollercoaster.</p>

      <p>Love Island winner Amber went for the white turtleneck and fluffy white coat that she matched with leather trousers.</p>
      <p>The ITV2 show host Caroline Flack had to be there too to look after her islanders. We wonder if her hair flips just as well in the cold as it does during her slow mo walks in the villa?</p>

      <p>The star went for a more log cabin look as she donned a brown coat with a fur collar and beige bakerboy cap.</p>
      <p>Where do we get VIP passes to hang out with everyone?</p>

        <i>Winter Wonderland is officially open to the public on 21 November from 4 pm. </i>
