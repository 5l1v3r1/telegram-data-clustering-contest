      <h1>Israel’s Attorney General Must Decide on Netanyahu Before the Next Election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T23:12:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 23:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968371" target="_blank">Haaretz Editorial</a></address>
      <p>The mandate given to Kahol Lavan Chairman Benny Gantz to form a government expired at midnight, and the chances that Israel is facing a third general election within a year have just increased.</p>
      <p>According to the law, after the mandate is returned to the president, the Knesset is allowed <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/netanyahu-and-gantz-both-failed-to-form-a-governing-coalition-what-happens-now-1.8157939">to seek a third candidate</a> who might form a government. Although there’s a theoretical possibility that 61 Knesset members will be found within 21 days to support such a candidate and submit his name to the president, chances are that what was beyond Benjamin Netanyahu and <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-Benny-Gantz-1.6806259">Benny Gantz</a> over the past two months will be beyond any other candidate.</p>
      <p>Israel finds itself in a political deadlock not only due to its inability to decide ideologically between right and left. The deadlock also reflects the Gordian knot that binds politics to <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-benjamin-netanyahu-1.5599046">Netanyahu’s</a> legal status, affecting the option of voting for him or forming a governing coalition with him. In the two elections this year, voters went to the polls under a cloud of uncertainty. The public was unsure whether the right’s candidate for prime minister was <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-explained-what-happens-now-ag-says-netanyahu-should-be-indicted-pending-hearing-1.6979282">about to face an indictment</a> for bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>This is an intolerable situation, and the political system responded accordingly, unable to resign itself to the absurdity in which a cloud of uncertainty hovers over a candidate. The solution has an address; Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit is having a hard time reaching a decision. The responsibility on his shoulders is indeed great, but he must decide and stop miring the country in uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Enough time has elapsed for making a decision. The lavish-gifts case (Case 1000) and the Yedioth Ahronoth news for favors case (Case 2000) were opened in mid-2016, becoming criminal investigations in January 2017. The Bezeq-Walla news for favors case (Case 4000) was opened at the end of 2017.</p>
      <p>For the sake of comparison, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein and State Prosecutor Edna Arbel needed only three months for ruling on the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-remembering-the-first-corruption-scandal-involving-bibi-and-the-ag-1.5840596">Bar-On-Hebron affair</a> in which an offer to replace the attorney general was allegedly made in exchange for closing a case against Netanyahu’s wife. The <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/olmert-gets-6-years-in-prison-1.5248097">charges against Ehud Olmert</a> in the cash-filled-envelopes case were filed by Attorney General Menachem Mazuz one year after the investigation was launched; in the case against former Finance Minister Abraham Hirschson, this number was 15 months.</p>
      <p>A third election isn’t the worst alternative among everything that could have happened if Netanyahu had formed a government. But a third election must be held only after Mendelblit announces his decision on the cases against Netanyahu. Mendelblit must decide before the next election.</p>
