      <h1>Talking points: Cups aren't a priority, but manner of the defeats are concerning for Sunderland</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland limped out of the FA Cup in the first round after another dismal and worrying display at Gillingham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:38:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Johns</a></address>
      <p>What is going on at Sunderland?</p>
      <p>There was so much early promise when <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> first took over and looked to get Sunderland playing on the front foot again. But one month on from his arrival, he's won just two in nine, and is now out of all three cup competitions.</p>
      <p>Gillingham was the culmination of a dreadful four-game run in the cups, with the Black Cats looking totally devoid of any answers to solve their problems. They lost 1-0 at Priestfield Stadium with no shots on target in 120 minutes of football.</p>
      <p>So what went wrong, and what is the solution? Here are the key talking points.</p>
      <h3>Direct with no plan B</h3>
      <p>Upon arrival, Bolton fans in particular told Sunderland fans to expect the worst football possible under Parkinson. And yet, in the first few weeks, the new man completely changed the Black Cats' style and got them playing on the front foot, with fast-paced, attacking intent. The 5-0 win over Tranmere was the model for exactly how Parkinson said he wanted his Sunderland side to play.</p>
      <p>And yet at Gillingham, Parkinson went down a worrying route more in line with what Sunderland fans were told to expect - aimless, direct football.</p>
      <p>Credit to Gillingham, they pressed high and got in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland's</a> faces, making it difficult to play. But with an experienced central midfield of Grant Leadbitter and Max Power, the visitors really ought to have coped better.</p>
      <p>Instead, the game was spent going pointlessly long; pointless because the front two of Will Grigg and Duncan Watmore did not win a thing all night. The ball just kept coming back time and time again.</p>
      <p>Now neither Grigg nor Watmore covered themselves in glory as they continuously failed to come anywhere near troubling the Gills defence, but nevertheless, it's easy to see why two strikers who enjoy running off the shoulder of last defenders, and receiving balls into the box, would grow frustrated at being asked to play as target men against six-foot-plus defenders.</p>
      <p>Sunderland have looked short of answers in recent weeks. We can only hope going forward that this direct approach isn't one Parkinson is considering long-term.</p>
      <h3>Young Brandon Taylor impresses</h3>

      <h3> </h3>
      <p>As bad as Sunderland were, there was the positive of their defence in this one. Going three at the back, they looked solid throughout, despite the fact their three centre-backs were a half-fit Alim Ozturk, a left-back out of form and match fitness in Laurens De Bock, and a 20-year-old Brandon Taylor making just his second senior start for the club.</p>
      <p>How solid they were at the back restricted Gillingham to just one shot on target all game. That came in the 105th minute when Brandon Hanlan won it for the hosts. But it also made it one of the worst games in recent history - that being the only shot on target in a scrappy, uneventful match.</p>
      <p>But Taylor was the shining light for Sunderland. In a brave and resilient performance, the youngster did not look the least bit out of place as he read the game superbly and threw himself into challenges and competed well in the air despite his limitations height-wise.</p>
      <p>Based on this performance, you have to think Parkinson might consider Taylor for a more important role in the first team going forward, although Jordan Willis and Joel Lynch will still be first choice when fit.</p>
      <h3>How does Phil Parkinson get his forwards firing?</h3>
      <p>It's the million dollar question, because right now it just isn't happening for them in the final third.</p>
      <p>What's so frustrating is how a side can go from hammering Tranmere 5-0 to the indecisive, slow tempo style that's followed since. Yes, Tranmere were poor, but based on what we've seen since, these Sunderland forwards look barely capable of scoring one, never mind five, against any side.</p>
      <p>January is just around the corner and you can be sure Parkinson will be looking for the solution in the transfer market. Until then he has to find an answer with what he's got at his disposal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lynden-gooch">Lynden Gooch</a> and Charlie Wyke are both due to return from injury soon and could provide a boost and something different, but neither scream season-savers. It's concerning as Sunderland desperately seek to stay in touch with the leading pack in League One.</p>
      <h3>Cups aren't a priority, but the manner of defeats is concerning - Coventry is huge</h3>
      <p>Yes, cups were never the priority, and so in many respects the last four games should be taken in isolation.</p>
      <p>If Sunderland win their next two league home matches against Coventry and Burton in the upcoming seven days then the reality is, what's happened in the last four games will be quickly forgotten. That's a big IF though.</p>
      <p>The issue isn't that Sunderland have gone out of competitions they should quite frankly care little about. It's the manner of the defeats in those games.</p>
      <p>All four performances - Leicester U23s, Scunthorpe and both ties with Gillingham - have been nothing short of pathetic. Really, the Sunderland players ought to be taking a good look at themselves for what they've recently served up.</p>
      <p>It all looks a big mess right now, from the boardroom down. It just looks like a total chaos club and the season is at risk of total implosion.</p>
      <p>The worry is, their cup form becomes infectious and impacts on their league form too - which hasn't been great itself, but good enough to keep Sunderland in with a shout.</p>
      <p>Coventry is a huge game. They simply must change the mood and change the tone on the pitch. Forget everything that's happened. Forget everything that is happening on the pitch. The players hold the power to change the mood with their performances on the pitch. It's up to them.</p>
      <h3>The future of Dylan McGeouch looks bleak</h3>

      <p>One start under Phil Parkinson came in the defeat to Leicester u21s and he failed to impress.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has had a miserable time on Wearside since joining last summer, with the label of being a coup for the club.</p>
      <p>A very good first pre-season had fans drooling at the prospect of watching him control games from the centre of the park and yet here we are in November of his second season and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/dylan-mcgeouch">McGeouch</a> looks completely lost. When he's played, he's had little to no impact at all.</p>
      <p>Barely featured under Ross, he's even less so under Parkinson. He just does not seem to be a player suited to Parkinson's style, and you have to imagine it's best for both parties that he goes elsewhere in January.</p>
      <p>McGeouch certainly doesn't lack quality, and clubs north of the border will surely queue to take him on. For whatever reason, McGeouch just hasn't found his feet in England though, and never looks likely too.</p>
