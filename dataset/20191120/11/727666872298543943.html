      <h1>A$AP Rocky Talks Going Back To Sweden To Give Back To Immigrants</h1>

      <p>The "Babushka Boi" rapper had no words for Trump.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Some people were shocked to learn A$AP Rocky is returning to Sweden for a concert after being <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/a-ap-rocky-found-guilty-of-assault-in-sweden-Mn781KPjpkaDsxoN5-oMag/">convicted of assault</a> there earlier this year. Besides performing, Rocky offered another explanation for why he is traveling back to the European nation.</p>
      <p>"When I was in Sweden I met so many people like myself," the man born Rakim Mayers told a <i>TMZ</i> cameraman. "All of those immigrants didn't really have the kind of support that they need. Me, being a celebrity, I had worldwide coverage. We had the American embassy."</p>
      <p>He continued, "These people come from countries that they don't have help. Sweden - they take in immigrants. I just felt like I wanted to give back... We're donating with the immigration service called <a href="https://www.farr.se/sv/in-english/information">FARR</a> that helps a lot of immigrants get the right kind of help that they need."</p>
      <p>Rocky expressed he is not concerned about potentially being caught up in another violent case while in Sweden. The 31-year-old American also avoided answering a question about whether he ever spoke to President Donald Trump about the situation.</p>
      <p>The rapper was detained in Stockholm for more than a month before he was found guilty and given a suspended sentence. Mayers and two co-defendants claimed self-defense against the alleged victim for the street fight that took place on June 30.</p>
