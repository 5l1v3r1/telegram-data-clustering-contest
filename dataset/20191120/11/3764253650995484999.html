      <p>The Real Deal’ is willing to lace up the gloves for the fourth fight with old rival Riddick Bowe, potentially over three rounds.</p>
      <p>Previously facing Bowe in 1992, 1993 and 1995, Holyfield lost twice and won once during an epic trilogy.</p>

      <p>The 57-year-old is now open to another battle with Bowe.</p>
      <p>“<i>I had something set-up in Japan that they were talking about doing but now nobody is saying nothing</i>,” Holyfield told World Boxing News.</p>
      <p><i>"Hopefully, it will [happen] but I had nobody say to me lately about it. If we do it then fine. If we don’t I’m good</i>,” he added.</p>
      <p>Continuing by revealing his own plan, Holyfield outlined his willingness to sign on for Bowe once again.</p>
      <p>“<i>I wanted to do it with Riddick Bowe</i>,” he pointed out.</p>
      <p>“<i>We’re friends. And the kind of money they’re talking about it would be pretty good for three rounds.</i>"</p>
      <p>“<i>Yes, I can do that (Holyfield vs Bowe IV). I’m ready!</i>”</p>
      <p>Losing his world title belts in their first collision, Holyfield avenged the loss and regained his straps one year later. In the process, becoming only the third man in history to do so.</p>
