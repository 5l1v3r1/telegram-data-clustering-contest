      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here!’s Adele Roberts came close to being sick as she took on the first food-related Bushtucker Trial of the series.</p>
      <p>After having us all in stitches over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">her framed photo of Jane McDonald</a>, the Radio 1 presenter had us in stitches as she went up against Roman Kemp in the challenge named Just Desserts.</p>
      <p>Extra Camp hosts Joel Dummett and Adam Thomas revealed last night that the two campmates were tasked with the hefty job of eating a pig’s uterus, camel’s anus, and sheep’s feet, in a bid to win stars for the rest of the all-star line-up. Delightful!</p>

      <p>Adele was first to take on the pig’s uterus aka piggy pudding – which she compared to the Demogorgon monster from the Netflix phenomenon Stranger Things.</p>
      <p>In a spoiler clip for the hilarious scenes, Adele psyched herself up before putting it into her mouth whole.</p>
      <p>Roman tried to help his fellow contestant through it and spouted some encouraging words of wisdom, saying: ‘Don’t worry about it. Swallow the juices, focus on the chew.</p>
      <p>‘Think how proud Jane is going to be!’</p>

      <p>But Adele shook her head and stamped her feet up and down as she tried to chew through the food.</p>
      <p>An intrigued Roman asked: ‘What does it taste like?’</p>

      <p>‘It’s disgusting,’ Adele replied as she wretched, leading Roman to look seriously concerned.</p>
      <p>Honestly, we can’t wait for this to air in full.</p>
      <p>This year, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebrity-bosses-confirm-live-bugs-wont-be-eaten-in-bush-tucker-trials-11168266/">I’m A Celebrity bosses have banned the use of live insects for Bushtucker Trials</a> after facing backlash from animal rights activists.</p>
      <p>A rep for I’m A Celeb told Metro.co.uk: ‘No live critters will be eaten in the Bushtucker Trials this year. Producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be eaten this year.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.’</p>
