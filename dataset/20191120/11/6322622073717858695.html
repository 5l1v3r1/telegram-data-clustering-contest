      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): Teo Seng Capital Bhd’s net profit has jumped 2.6 times to RM18.05 million or 6.02 sen per share for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19), against RM7.02 million or 2.34 sen per share a year earlier, on higher revenue from its poultry farming business.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue grew 10.47% to RM138.38 million, from RM125.26 million, according to its filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>The company attributed the higher topline from its poultry farming business to the rebounded selling price of eggs, coupled with the increase in sales quantities of eggs, resulting from better sustainable production efficiency.</p>
      <p>The group declared a two sen dividend per share for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), payable on Dec 19.</p>
      <p>For the nine months (9MFY19), its net profit tripled to RM45.22 million, from RM13.1 million last year, while revenue grew 19.55% to RM410.14 million, from RM343.06 million.</p>
      <p>On prospects, in view of the stable feed cost and cost efficiency, Teo Seng said the directors are positive of the group’s financial performance for the remaining three months of FY19.</p>
      <p>Shares of Teo Seng closed one sen or 0.72% higher at RM1.39 today, valuing the company at RM416.62 million. Over the past year, the counter grew some 74% from 80 sen.</p>
