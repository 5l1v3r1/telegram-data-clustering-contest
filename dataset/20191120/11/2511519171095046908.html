      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> has been dismissed after five-and-a-half extremely successful seasons in north London – to the horror of numerous Spurs fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> may have started the season in disastrous form – and the pressure may have been growing on the Argentine – but Pochettino will always hold a special place in the heart of fans for the way he turned an underachieving club into Champions League finalists.</p>
      <p>A major trophy may have eluded Pochettino during his time at the club, but he leaves north London with the fourth highest win percentage of any manager in their history, his 54.27% record better than the likes of Harry Redknapp, Arthur Rowe and the legendary Bill Nicholson.  </p>
      <p>The feelings are still raw on Wednesday morning, so does any Spurs fan have the courage to take on our Pochettino challenge, and click through 20 of the most memorable photographs taken during his time in charge?</p>
      <p>Those of an emotional disposition are advised to look away now…</p>
