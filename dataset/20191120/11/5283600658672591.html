      <p>The Image Towers, which will house studios, training institutes and shared services for the animation, visual effects and gaming industry, will be ready by the end of 2021 or early 2022.</p>
      <p>"The facility with 16 lakh sq ft of developed area will have studios, infrastructure and shared services for the entertainment industry. Our aim is to make Hyderabad a hub for the South Asian industry in the gaming, technology and entertainment space with high-end visual effects, post-production facilities and other infrastructure,” Telangana Minister for Information Technology and Industries K T Rama Rao has said.</p>
      <p>“We can offer global players with anything from animation to visual effects to gaming to motion capture technologies,” he said, citing the contribution of local players for global hits such as Baahubali.</p>

      <p>The second IndiaJoy is expected to draw over 30,000 visitors, including 1,000 delegates from India and abroad, representing digital, media, gaming and entertainment industry.</p>
      <p>Quoting a survey, K T Rama Rao put the size of animation industry at $270 billion. “It's important to make localised animation content and create regional content for OTT (over the top) Internet-based content distribution. There is a huge potential here,” he said.</p>
