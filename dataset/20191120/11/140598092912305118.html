      <p>Ice cream is the perfect vehicle for any leftover Christmas pudding, and this makes an indulgent dessert for Boxing Day and beyond.</p>
      <p>This recipe uses a method for a classic crème anglaisem but I have also given my cheat's version below. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 20 minutes, plus churning and freezing time | <b>Cooking time:</b> 20 minutes</p>
      <h4>SERVES</h4>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>130g caster sugar</li>
        <li>400ml milk</li>
        <li>500ml double cream</li>
        <li>200g leftover cooked Christmas pudding, crumbled</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>METHOD</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Have a bowl of ice or iced water ready for the sauce.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and thick.</li>
        <li> Heat the milk and cream together in a pan and bring to the boil. Just as it comes to the boil, remove from the heat and pour one third of it over the egg mixture, whisking well.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the milk and cream, put the pan back over the heat, and allow to come to a low boil, whisking all the time.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and pour the sauce through a sieve into a bowl set over ice or ice water.</li>
        <li> When the sauce has cooled, fold in the crumbled Christmas pudding and turn the mixture into an ice-cream machine.</li>
        <li>Churn as per the manufacturer’s instructions until set then transfer to a container to freeze.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>My cheat’s version of Christmas pudding ice cream</h3>
      <p>You don’t need to make a proper crème anglaise, and you can do it without an ice-cream maker.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b>10 minutes, plus a few hours freezing time </p>
      <h4>SERVES</h4>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 large egg yolks (these stay raw, so they must be British lion stamped) </li>
        <li>100g caster sugar</li>
        <li>150g cooked Christmas pudding</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Madeira or brandy</li>
        <li>300ml double cream</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>METHOD</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl until pale and thick.</li>
        <li>Crumble the Christmas pudding into the egg and sugar mix, stirring well, then add the Madeira or brandy and mix again.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the cream until you have soft peaks, then fold this into the pudding mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a freezable container, such as a 450g loaf tin lined with cling film, and freeze for a few hours to set.</li>
      </ol>
