        <li>Celebrity manager, and co-owner of Big Machine Records, <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/scooter-braun">Scooter Braun</a>, posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Cfsjonz1g/">a quote on his Instagram</a> on November 19.</li>
        <li>This is amid <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-angry-scooter-braun-buying-old-music-explainer-2019-7">his very public disagreement</a> with <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> about her old music.</li>
        <li>The post read: "Kindness is the only response," and Braun wrote in the caption that these are "words to live by."</li>
        <li>Swift and Braun are currently in a dispute about her first six albums, which Braun bought when he and Scott Borchetta took over Big Machine Records earlier this year in a $300 million sale. <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867">She tweeted</a> on November 14 that Braun and Borchetta were preventing her from playing her old music at the AMAs.</li>
        <li>Big Machine Records denied the claims, but <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-team-email-response-big-machine-music-recorded-performances-2019-11">an email to Insider appears to corroborate Swift's story</a>. Several celebrities have also <a href="https://www.insider.com/gigi-hadid-selena-gomez-support-taylor-swift-in-feud-with-scooter-braun-2019-11">spoken up in support of Swift</a>.</li>

      <p>Braun and Scott Borchetta bought the label Big Machine Records earlier this year in a $300 million sale <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-scooter-braun-sale-big-machine-2019-6">that included Swift's first six albums</a> that she left behind when she switched to Universal Music Group in 2018. At the time, Swift said of the purchase: "All I could think about was the incessant, manipulative bullying I've received at his hands for years."</p>
      <p>She was referring to the situation surrounding her ongoing feud with Kanye West, who was managed by Braun, about his music video for "Famous" which she believed was derogatory. She also referenced Justin Bieber, another of Braun's clients, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzWYdS9Hj5R/?utm_source=ig_web_options_share_sheet">getting involved</a>.</p>
      <p>"Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it," Swift said.</p>
      <p>On November 14, <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867">Swift tweeted that she didn't "know what else to do"</a> because Braun and Borchetta were <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-accused-scott-borchetta-scooter-braun-block-songs-amas-2019-11">blocking her from performing her old songs at the AMAs</a>.</p>
      <p>She said she was going to perform "a medley of my hits throughout the decade on the show," but claimed that Braun and Borchetta wouldn't allow it as it "would be re-recording my music before I'm allowed to next year."</p>
      <p>She also alleged that Brain and Borchetta "declined the use of my older music or performance footage for this project, even though there is no mention of either of them or Big Machine Records anywhere in the film," and asked her fans "to talk some sense into the men who are exercising control."</p>
      <p>Several celebrities, including Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid, <a href="https://www.insider.com/gigi-hadid-selena-gomez-support-taylor-swift-in-feud-with-scooter-braun-2019-11">have since spoken out in support of Swift</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-team-email-response-big-machine-music-recorded-performances-2019-11">Big Machine Records soon denied the claims</a> Swift made. However, Swift's spokesperson <a href="https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-team-email-response-big-machine-music-recorded-performances-2019-11">shared a letter with Insider</a> dated October 28, 2019, that appeared to show Swift was prevented from performing her old songs.</p>
