      <p>Snow Patrol are celebrating their twenty fifth anniversary and last night at the Royal Concert Hall they showcased reworked tracks from their extensive back catalogue, and also managed to keep things fresh by adding some new songs to their set list.</p>
      <p>When frontman Gary Lightbody came out on to the stage, filled with musicians, and simply stood there in the dark for opener Dark Roman Wine, this packed crowd instantly knew that they were witnessing something totally different.</p>

      <p>Admitting that this was an unusual concert, Lightbody explained that the set list would be showcased over two halves, the first being slow and melodic with a more up-tempo second half. Then there was a beautiful reworked You’re All I Have, which was followed up with a toe tapping New York.</p>
      <p>For the song An Olive Grove Facing The Sea, Lightbody’s band mates left him in the hands of a trombonist, which was a real delight.</p>
      <p>Back on for Crack The Shutters and new song I Think Of Home, Snow Patrol brought the first half to a close with a reworked Take Back The City.</p>

      <p>Having totally endeared himself to the crowd, Lightbody interacted easily between the songs and undoubtedly entertained. Starting the second half with new song, Time Won’t Go Slowly, his voice filled the auditorium with his heartfelt lyrics.</p>
      <p>Fans' favourite Chocolate had the crowd clapping along while for Run they were on their feet, its electronic backing and powerful gospel feel simply mesmerising.</p>

      <p>Chasing Cars, the most played song of the 21st century, was given the reworked treatment too. The crowd singing the words right back at the band created a goose bump inducing moment.</p>
      <p>What If This Is All The Love You Ever Get and Just Say Yes rounded off a night of musical loveliness.</p>
