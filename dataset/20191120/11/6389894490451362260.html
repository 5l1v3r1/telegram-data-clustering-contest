      <p>The UK has summoned China’s ambassador after a former employee of the British consulate in China alleged he was tortured by Chinese police.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong citizen Simon Cheng said he was tortured during a 15-day detention by police in mainland China.</p>
      <p>Cheng said Chinese secret police shackled him, beat him and deprived him of sleep while they questioned him on the UK’s role in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>“I was hung (handcuffed and shackled) on a steep X-Cross doing a spread-eagled pose for hours after hours,” Cheng said in a post on Facebook.</p>

      <p>“Sometimes, they ordered me to do the ‘stress tests’, which includes extreme strength exercise such as ‘squat’ and ‘chair pose’ for countless hours. They beat me every time I failed to do so using something like sharpened batons.”</p>
      <p>Foreign secretary Dominic Raab summoned the Chinese ambassador to the UK to explain the “disgraceful” treatment Cheng had received.</p>
      <p>“Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team. We were shocked and appalled by the mistreatment he suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture,” Raab said.</p>
      <p>“I summoned the Chinese Ambassador to express our outrage at the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon in violation of China’s international obligations,” Raab said.</p>
      <p>Cheng said he was arrested inside West Kowloon station in Hong Kong in August on his return from a trip to mainland China for a business conference.</p>

      <p>China has a controversial border post inside the station which was opened following the launch of the Hong Kong-Shenzhen high-speed rail link last year.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters view the border post as another example of China’s encroachment on Hong Kong’s freedoms.</p>
      <p>Cheng was forced to give a written confession for betraying the motherland, a statement of apology and a confession for “soliciting prostitution”. He was instructed to sing the Chinese national anthem and recorded singing.</p>
      <p>“I won’t give up the fight for human rights, peace, freedom and democracy for the rest of my life, no matter the danger, discrimination and retaliation I will face, and no matter how my reputation will be stained, and no matter whether my future would be blacklisted, labelled, and ruined,” Cheng said.</p>
      <p>China’s UK embassy was contacted for comment.</p>
