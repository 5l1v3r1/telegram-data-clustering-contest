      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Earlier, the NEPRA issued performance reports of production and distribution companies.</p>
      <p>The regulator, in its report, said that all four power generation companies (GENCOs) remained closed more than their stipulated time thus inflicting Rs64.62 billion loses as 9.37 billion units of electricity could not be produced.</p>
      <p>The report said GENCO1, GENCO2 and GENCO3 inflicted Rs190 million, Rs48 billion, and Rs15 billion loses, respectively. The production companies remained on standby mode to an alarming level.</p>
      <p>The production companies could not meet up their capacity in 2016-2018 and inflicted Rs4 billion loses to the economy.</p>
      <p>It further noted that the NTDC and K-Electric’s line losses in 2017-18 increased by 525% due to not improving the system.</p>
      <p>Last year, 74.9 million units could not reach user end and that loss increased to 460 million units this year. The report said NTDC’s loses increased to Rs480 million from Rs410 million.</p>
