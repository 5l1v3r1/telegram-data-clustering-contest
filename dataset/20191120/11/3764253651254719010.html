        <i>"You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career. I'll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions; between $10 and $30 million.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting,''</i> Floyd Mayweather told Reuters.</p>
