      <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/terramaster/">TerraMaster</a> has introduced their newest device and this time it’s not a NAS but a DAS. The new device is the D8 Thunderbolt 3 which gives most features away in the name. It has 8 drive bays and it connects via high-speed <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/thunderbolt-3/">Thunderbolt 3</a> ports.</p>
      <h3>TerraMaster D8 Thunderbolt 3</h3>
      <p>TerraMaster units are always easy to recognise as the feature the same kind of design. A beautiful aluminium shell and pinhole LEDs. The D8 is a little different though as it is a vertical unit and not a horizontal. That gives it a very small footprint for an <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/8-bay/">8-bay</a> device which helps with the tidiness on your desk. To top it off, it also features carry handles on the top. A feature which might sound silly, but is very useful as a device loaded with hard drives gets quite heavy.</p>

      <p>The D8 Thunderbolt 3 features hardware raid with support for RAID 0/1/5/10/50. The performance will naturally depend on the installed drives and setup, but it can easily reach a throughput of up to 1600MB/s. Whether you install speedy <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/2.5-inch/">2.5-inch</a> <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/ssd/">SSD</a>s or large-capacity <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/3.5-inch/">3.5-inch</a> <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/hdd/">HDD</a>s is up to you.</p>

      <p>A perfect unit for tasks such as video editing, whether it’s simple 4K or the latest 8K type. High-res photo and graphic designers will also love it.</p>
      <h3>Connection Options</h3>
      <p>Since the TerraMaster D8 Thunderbolt 3 device is a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/das/">DAS</a>, there aren’t a lot of connection options. That said, while there are few, they’re worth it. There are two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a DisplayPort connector. This allows you to not only connect 8 drives to a 40 Gbps Thunderbolt 3 port, but it also allows you to daisy-chain more units to the port through the second Thunderbolt 3 port. This could be other storage devices or even another monitor.</p>

      <p>While it might sound silly to connect a monitor through a data port, it isn’t. For example notebook users, such as those with the MacBook, don’t have a whole lot of ports available. With Thunderbolt 3 and a unit such as the D8 Thunderbolt 3, these users can easily attach two 4K monitors to their system.</p>
      <p>It’s also worth mentioning that the unit has an internal power supply which makes the setup cleaner than with an external power brick.</p>
