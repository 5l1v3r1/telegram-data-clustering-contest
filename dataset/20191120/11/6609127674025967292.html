      <p>The mum died suddenly at her Falkirk homeShe said: "I'm in total shock, I just didn't expect that at all. I still just can't take it in.</p>
      <p>"Aleise has been really upset. Her mum got her a doll and she takes it to bed with her every night and won't let anyone touch it."</p>
      <p>It is the second tragedy to hit the family in recent years, after her little brother Jordan passed away following a battle with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
      <p>Tracey said: "It's really hard because that's me lost my son and my daughter. I have three other kids but it's still so hard.</p>
      <p>"A parent should never had to bury a child - and I've had to do it twice."</p>
      <p>Close pal Martina Rooney, who shares a child with April's brother, said April was an "amazing mum" to Aleise, aged seven.</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to the tragic 27-year-old, she added: "RIP April. Had a few good memories and will laugh about them forever."</p>
