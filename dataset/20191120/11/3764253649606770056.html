      <p>After the arrest was made, there were speculations that Tonto was deported from the city. Well, her best friend, Bobrisky posted a video of the actress to dispel the rumours. In the video, Tonto made sure to show that she is still in Dubai.</p>

      <p>More details about Tonto’s detention has emerged after a close source to the actress revealed in an interview with Kemi Ashefon that the mother of one is still in Dubai.</p>
      <p>According to the source, Bobrisky’s post about Tonto is just damage control to make fans think everything is well.</p>
      <p>The source said: <i>“First, Tonto is not the type to use that kind of video to debunk allegations of detention and deportation.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>She would have used a more beautiful background wearing gorgeous clothes and displaying affluence. That was a damage control video she shared through Bobrisky. Tonto was looking like a tart! She wasn’t wearing make-up and looking like a prisoner in one small room! Anyways, in the video, there was no address about or her arrest. The Tonto we knew would have tore whoever wrote that story into shreds.”</i>

      <p>Kemi Ashefon’s source also commented on this. The source said: <i>“Who is fooling who? She said she is still in Dubai but her password is still in Africa! In this IT age? The video looks so stupid! Meanwhile, before the new page, she had posted many photos from Dubai on the old page @tontolet which has over 5million followers. It was on her old page she posted her ‘fake gift’ from Timi Frank. She even bought a new phone to run the new page! As a matter of fact, she removed the nylon seal from the cover of the phone!”</i></p>
