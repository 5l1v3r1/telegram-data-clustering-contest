      <p>Bafana Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki, will now be hoping to finalise his contract with the South African Football Association now that his first two competitive games have been played.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ntseki has won two and lost one of his first three games in charge of the South African national team since taking over from Stuart Baxter earlier in the year, but – as reported by Soccer Laduma – he is still on the same assistant contract that he was on while the Englishman was in charge.</p>
      <p>In this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma, the crew contacted the coach’s representative, Thato Matuka of Brand Arc, who confirmed there was no contract in place, insisting that he’s hopeful things could get sorted soon.</p>
      <p>Matuka explained, “This is a big contract for us, so we had to take our time and do it right. Together with our attorneys, we went back &amp; forth with Mr. (Russell) Paul, but unfortunately he left the association before we could conclude.</p>
      <p>“The handover to the new CEO (Gay Mokoena) has been smooth. I spoke to him on his first week of duty and we agreed to resume talks after the two big games.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Now, after the defeat to Ghana and win over Sudan in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Ntseki will be focused on making sure he gets a new contract in place as he looks to take things forward, and will be anticipating the draw for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers ahead of the next international break in March.  </p>
