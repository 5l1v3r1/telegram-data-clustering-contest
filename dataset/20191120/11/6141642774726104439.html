      <p>Paul Dybala came mightily close to joining Tottenham in the summer, but the deal could not get over the line due to the playerâ€™s image rights. A fee and personal terms were agreed with Juventus, so that could also be a move that is fairly easy to resurrect, as long as they can find a way around the rights issue. Dybala could be open to the move as he is not getting a huge amount of gametime at Juve and he would be a signing that would excite the fans.</p>
      <h3>Sign a defender</h3>
