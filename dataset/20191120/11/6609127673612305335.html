        <b>CELTIC starlet Lee O'Connor scored a brilliant goal as Ireland U-21s came from behind to beat Sweden.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops'</a> summer signing is yet to appear for Neil Lennon's top team - but has shown his credentials on the international stage.</p>

      <p>The 19-year-old <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4956933/celtic-lee-oconnor-assist-ireland-debut/">made his full international debut last week</a> and grabbed an assist in the 3-1 win over New Zealand.</p>
      <p>He was back on Under-21 duty last night and his goal sparked a stunning comeback against the Swedes in Euro qualifying.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kenny's men currently occupy top spot in their section from Italy - who have played two games less.</p>
      <p>The visitors opened the scoring after 18 minutes through Viktor Gyoekeres.</p>

      <p>Former Manchester United teen O'Connor levelled for the hosts before Adam Idah turned the game on its head.</p>
      <p>Troy Parrott and Zach Elbouzedi added further strikes as the home side ran out comfortable winners in the end.</p>
      <p>O'Connor, who arrived at Parkhead on summer deadline day, has set himself a target of pushing for Celtic's first team.</p>
      <p>Speaking after his Ireland debut last week, he said: "My whole family came up and my friends.</p>
      <p>"It was a great moment for me and for them. It’s something you work for your whole life. To get it at 19 years of age is a dream come true… it doesn’t get much better.</p>
      <p>"I felt fine. At the start you have a couple of butterflies but once the whistle blows you just have to get on with it.</p>
      <p>"Everyone was very welcoming. They just said, 'do what got you here’, that I’m here for a reason, to play my normal game… to just play football.</p>
      <p>"Of course there’s a big step-up, but I think I done well. I’m happy with my performance. Hopefully it’s the first of many.</p>
      <p>"The assist was a great moment for me. Robbie’s left footed. It kind of played into my hands, I could go around the outside. I thought we worked well together.</p>
      <p>"That’s what I want to do now, push for the first team at Celtic. Hopefully I can."</p>
