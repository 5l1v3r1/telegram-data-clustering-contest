      <h1>Carragher, Sutton and Crouch queue up to criticise Mauricio Pochettino’s sacking</h1>
      <h2>The pundits slammed the decision to sack the Argentine, who has been replaced by Jose Mourinho.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:45:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Carragher, Peter Crouch and Chris Sutton have all criticised Tottenham’s decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino just months after he led Tottenham into the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Carragher told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11865154/tottenhams-mauricio-pochettino-sacking-out-of-order-says-jamie-carragher">Sky Sports</a>: “It’s a massive shock. The job Mauricio Pochettino has done is miraculous. The timing is very strange. He’s been sacked – I find that really, really strange and it’s a bit out of order considering the job he’s done.”</p>
      <p>Over in the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703723/Flabbergasted-Peter-Crouch-reacts-Mauricio-Pochettinos-Spurs-sacking.html">Daily Mail</a>, former Spurs striker Peter Crouch added: “I’m flabbergasted by Tottenham’s decision. Some clubs would build a statue for a manager who took them to the biggest game in club football. I fear it is a decision Tottenham will regret.”</p>
      <p>His fellow <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703851/Chris-Sutton-blasts-ridiculous-decision-sack-Mauricio-Pochettino.html">BT Sport pundit</a> said to the same paper: “Where’s the loyalty? Chairman Daniel Levy said he was ‘reluctant’ to do it. Well, you went ahead and did it, and I see this as a huge backward step. He can be proud of his time at Tottenham and leave with his chest puffed out – but with a knife in his back.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – The demand for Pochettino’s services will underline what a job he’s done</h3>
      <p>Pochettino came to Tottenham as a manager who had done a good job with Southampton and leaves it as arguably the hottest managerial property in world football.</p>
      <p>Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and Real Madrid will lead the chase and Tottenham fans will likely never forget the memories he provided.</p>
      <p>It feels like a backwards step getting Mourinho in but he does have a history of winning trophies. Will he leave Tottenham in as good a state as Pochettino does? That’s unlikely.</p>
