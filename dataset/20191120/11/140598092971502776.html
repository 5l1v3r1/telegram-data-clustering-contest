      <p>For me, porcini is one of the best risottos of all time. Any dried porcini works well; they’re not cheap, but you don’t need a whole load of them.</p>
      <p>Any leftovers from this can be allowed to set, then you can roll portions of the risotto into small balls, coat them in breadcrumbs and fry to make arancini.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 15 minutes |<b> Cooking time</b>: 30 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four to six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50g dried porcini mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>150g cold butter, diced</li>
        <li>300g risotto rice</li>
        <li>100ml white wine</li>
        <li>100g freshly grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>20g chopped parsley</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the mushrooms in a bowl and pour over 450ml hot water to cover them. Leave to soak for 10 minutes to rehydrate them.</li>
        <li>To drain, lift out the mushrooms with a slotted spoon (the mushrooms will have grit in them so this gets left behind) and chop them roughly. Strain the mushroom water through a fine sieve or coffee filter into a saucepan and keep hot.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan and cook the onion and garlic until soft and transparent.</li>
        <li> Add one teaspoon of the butter then add the rice and toast it, stirring, for three minutes.</li>
        <li> Pour in the wine and heat until the liquid disappears, deglazing the pan, then add the chopped porcini.</li>
        <li>Make sure the mushroom liquor is hot before you start to add it to the rice. If it tastes too strong you can let it cool down with a splash of water. Add the liquid a spoonful at a time, waiting for it to disappear before adding the next lot. The risotto should take around 17 to 20 minutes to cook.</li>
        <li>The rice will lose its whiteness but should retain a slight bite when eaten.</li>
        <li>To finish the risotto, remove it from the heat and stir in the rest of the butter along with the parmesan and parsley, mixing with a wooden spoon so that it forms a creamy risotto. Serve immediately.</li>
