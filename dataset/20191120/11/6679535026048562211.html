      <h1>Jose Mourinho named Tottenham Hotspur manager, replaces Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>Returns to Premier League 11 months after leaving Man Utd</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:08:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have named Jose Mourinho as their new manager on a contract that runs until the end of the 2022-23 season, the Premier League club said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Portuguese returns to management for the first time since being sacked by Manchester United in December. He replaces Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by Spurs on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football,” Spurs Chairman Daniel Levy said in a statement on the club website.</p>
      <p>“He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino took the club to their first Champions League final last season, where they lost to Liverpool, but was sacked after a poor run of form in 2019, during which the team have won six of their last 24 league games.</p>
      <p>Spurs, who currently sit 14th in the league, are the third Premier League club that Mourinho will manage having won the league title three times with Chelsea in two separate stints.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” Mourinho said. “The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has won trophies at every major club he has managed -- including two Champions League titles with Porto and Inter Milan - while Spurs have not won silverware since the 2008 League Cup.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese won the Europa League in his first season at United and finished second in the Premier League the following season -- marking their highest finish since Alex Ferguson retired.</p>
      <p>He was sacked last December following a 3-1 league defeat by Liverpool that effectively ended their title hopes.</p>
