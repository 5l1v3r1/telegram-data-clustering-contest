      <p>Known for its numerous retro-inspired <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/accessories">accessories</a>, design and tech company <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/elago">Elago</a> has now created an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple">Apple</a> <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-ipod">iPod</a>-inspired <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-airpods">AirPods</a> case.</p>
      <p>The new AW6 Case has been designed to look like the second generation iPod with a signature click wheel emblazoned on its front. The case has been crafted from scratch-free premium silicone, providing extra protection for your AirPods should you accidentally drop them. Additionally the case features a hold switch button on the top, similar to the ones found on the iPod Classic.</p>
      <p>In terms of specs, the case is compatible with both 1st and 2nd generation AirPods and supports wireless charging. Unfortunately the new AirPods Pro won’t be able to work with this case. The device comes in either a black or white colorway, with a red click wheel on the former and grey on the latter.</p>
