      <p>The house where Adolf Hitler was born is being turned into a police station.</p>
      <p>The Nazi dictator was born in the town of Braunau am Inn in Austria in 1889, near the border with Germany.</p>
      <p>The move ends years of uncertainty over the building's future.</p>

      <p>Austrian interior minister, Wolfgang Peschorn, said the new use of the site as a police building "should send an unmistakable signal that this building will forever be removed from the commemoration of national socialism".</p>
      <p>Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, shortly before launching a campaign of military conquest and racist extermination across Europe that cost tens of millions of lives.</p>
      <p>The house where Hitler was born will be redesigned, following an international architectural competition.</p>
      <p>It was expropriated from the previous owner in 2017.</p>
