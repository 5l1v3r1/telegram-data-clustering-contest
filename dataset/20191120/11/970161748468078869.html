      <p>A resident at their wits end over parked cars hogging space on the pavement made their feelings known with this passive aggressive note.</p>
      <p>In a bid to stop the driver of the white car from ever mounting the curb again, they printed a message on A4 paper and stuck it behind the rear wiper.</p>
      <p>The note read: ‘I PARK ON THE PAVEMENT BECAUSE I AM FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHER PEOPLE.’</p>
      <p>As he walked through the a residential suburb of Handbridge in Chester, Cheshire, Twitter user @kevbrackenbury spotted the angry message and shared a picture of it with the caption ‘I park therefore I am’.</p>
      <p>He revealed the area the car was parked in but refused to say which street it was on.</p>

      <p>People were quick to call the note ‘hilarious’ and ‘brilliant’ and an example of ‘people power’ in action.</p>

      <p>Another said this sort of tactic ‘might be good for those that feel the need to take up 1.5 spaces in car parks too’.</p>
      <p>Parking on a pavement has been illegal in London since 1974 and can result in a £70 fine for offenders.</p>
      <p>There is no general ban anywhere else in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, but MPs have called for the law to be extended to the rest of the UK.</p>
      <p>Last month Scottish Parliament passed a bill which will ban pavement parking across the country.</p>
