      <h1>Let's buy local rice - Duterte</h1>

      <h3>AMID the current slump in palay prices, President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday called on lawmakers to allot additional funds for the purchase of rice harvest from local farmers.</h3>
      <p>“Sabi ko kay (I told Agriculture Secretary William) Dar and Congress, you appropriate money and we will buy all the rice, farm gate price for all the farmers,” Duterte said in a press conference in Malacañang on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Kung gusto talaga nating walang problema, bilhin lahat ng produce ng farmers. Ngayon mahal ang farmgate nila... di na bale, bilhin natin. Para ‘yung farmers, may resulta sa pawis nila. Sinong nalugi? Wala. Tapos dagdagan natin kasi kulang talaga,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>Duterte in September previously ordered the National Food Authority to buy local harvest in an effort to combat farmers’ losses brought by the dipping prices.</p>
      <p>A measure seeking to mandate government agencies to do the same has hurdled Congress last week.</p>
      <p>The House of Representatives approved on final reading House Joint Resolution No. 22, which would allow agencies to use the rice subsidy fund under the General Appropriations Act to purchase palay from local farmers—instead of rolling out cash assistance. Its counterpart measure was also approved in the Senate.<br/>    <br/>Rice importation suspended</p>
      <p>The chief executive has also directed the Agriculture Department to suspend rice importation as it is already harvest season in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Duterte, however, stressed he cannot halt rice tariffication, as the measure is also seen to safeguard government agencies against corruption.</p>
      <p>He added the import policy will also serve as a “buffer” for the government—as the country’s current rice supply will not be enough for millions of consumers.</p>
      <p>“Mag-import tayo (let’s import) for the buffer, because the produce will not be enough for the consumers — for Filipinos eating rice,” Duterte told reporters in Malacañang.</p>
      <p>Duterte implemented rice tariffication in February in a bid to lower the price of rice by easing import restrictions, which in turn would increase the supply in the country.</p>
      <p>The policy has led to more imported rice in the market, which, in effect, brought down prices of palay or unmilled rice. Several advocates have lambasted the measure, saying it has hurt the income and livelihood of local farmers.</p>
