      <p>A great steamed pudding served with warm custard is evocative of cosying up in the colder months. People always think of puddings as stodgy, but for me, they should be light and fluffy. Steam your treacle pudding in a steamer if you’ve got one, with the steamer pan on top of the water. And if you haven’t got a steamer, use ramekins. Make sure there’s constant steam, as you don’t want it to dry out.</p>
      <p>This is the best recipe – everything just needs to be blitzed together.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>15 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>2 hours</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>180g softened butter, plus extra for greasing the basin and paper</li>
        <li>3 tbsp golden syrup</li>
        <li>180g self raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 large tbsp black treacle</li>
        <li>180g soft brown sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Custard or cream to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Generously butter a one-litre pudding basin. Add three tablespoons of golden syrup to the bottom of the basin and leave to one side.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl then add the black treacle, brown sugar and eggs and whisk with a hand blender until you have a smooth, even mixture.</li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into the pudding basin and level it out then cover with a circle of buttered parchment paper sitting directly on the mixture.</li>
        <li>Now cut out a large square of foil and one of parchment paper and place the paper on top of the foil. Make a fold in both across the middle – the pieces need to be large enough to cover the top of the basin with at least 2.5cm overhang around the edge.</li>
        <li> Place this over the basin, foil facing down, and tie with string twice around the rim and then over the top of the basin to form a little handle (you will need to borrow someone’s finger to help with this!).</li>
        <li> Set the bowl on a couple of upside-down ramekins in a large saucepan and fill the pan with water to just below the tops of the ramekins. Place on a low-medium heat and steam for two hours, but make sure you check the water levels – you don’t want the pan drying out.</li>
        <li>Take the basin out of the pan. To remove the pudding, run a knife around the edge and tip it out on to a serving plate. Serve with custard or cream.</li>
