      <p><b>NASA</b>'s Maryland Space Center experts in have confirmed that there are traces of water vapor above the surface of <b>Jupiter</b>'s icy <b>moon</b> <b>Europa</b>, Science Alert reported.</p>
      <p>They analyzed data obtained from the Hawaiian Keck Observatory over 17 observations with a spectrograph to study the chemical compositions of other planets' atmospheres by scanning the infrared light they release or absorb</p>
      <p>The researchers concluded that the release of water vapor is not as active as previously thought, but in the form of separate intense eruptions.</p>
      <p>"While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form," lead researcher and <b>NASA</b> planetary scientist Lucas Paganini said in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa">a <b>NASA</b> statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The existence of liquid water on the <b>moon</b> <b>Europa</b> has not yet been proven. However, according to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0933-6">a paper</a> published in the journal<i> Nature Astronomy</i> on Monday, the <b>NASA</b> team discovered enough water vapor being released from <b>Europa</b> to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes, Science Alert reported.</p>
      <p><b>NASA</b>'s forthcoming <b>Europa</b> Clipper mission will allow us to investigate the surface of <b>Jupiter</b>'s ice <b>moon</b> in detail in 2023. The spacecraft will make 45 orbits around the <b>Jupiter</b> <b>moon</b> in question. It will be equipped with cameras, spectrographs and radars to examine its ice cover.</p>
