      <p>The region’s farming community had their voices well and truly heard when they attended an event at the Scottish Parliament last week.</p>
      <p>Around 25 people from Dumfries and Galloway’s agricultural community joined others from across Scotland to sing in the Farmers’ Choir.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the issues in rural welfare, the choir’s performance was a focal point of the evening, where Carry You Home was the first of four songs.</p>
      <p>The evening was hosted by south of Scotland MSP Emma Harper to talk about the issues faced when living and working in rural communities.</p>
      <p>Ms Harper aid: “Social isolation and loneliness can affect anyone – at all ages and stages of life. As our society changes, there is increasing recognition of social isolation and loneliness as major public health issues that can have a significant impact on a person’s physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Social isolation is particularly prevalent in rural Scotland and can have profound implications on our agricultural community. I was therefore delighted to host this event which raises awareness of mental health issues in farming and rural communities across Scotland.</p>
      <p>“The Farmers’ Choir is an absolutely fantastic initiative led by Kate Picken and brings together people for a common aim – to sing, socialise and raise awareness of this important cause. Singing has also been proven to be very beneficial for health and wellbeing.</p>

      <p>The event was held in the garden lobby of the Scottish Parliament and Ms Harper invited health professionals as well as Teresa Dougall from the National Farmers Union Scotland and Finlay Carson MSP to talk about social isolation and how it impacts upon people right across Scotland.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Attendees heard about how a lack of human connection can lead to mental health isues and how social isolation can cause depression and in extreme cases lead to thoughts of suicide.</p>
      <p>Mr Carson said: “I am grateful to the Farmers’ Choir for coming to parliament and to Emma for sponsoring this event.</p>
      <p>“There is so much good work going on across Scotland to address rural isolation, which has an impact on many both in Dumfries and Galloway and up and down the country.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">“I pay particular tribute to those members of the choir from my own constituency and wish the choir all the very best for the future – and hope to see them again soon.”</a>
