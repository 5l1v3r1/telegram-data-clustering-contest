      <p>Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will testify Wednesday morning before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence about his part in a plan to get Ukraine officials to promise to open an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son in exchange for the release of millions of dollars of military aid.</p>

      <p>Sondland will likely be grilled on the reason he testified in a closed-door House hearing that he had not told Ukrainian officials that the military aid was dependent on investigations into the Bidens and election interference in the 2016 presidential election. Sondland revised that testimony earlier this month saying he remembered telling a Ukrainian official that the military aid was "likely" dependent on the country announcing the investigations.</p>
      <p>Sondland is set to testify beginning at 9 a.m. ET</p>
      <p>An afternoon session will be held beginning between 2:30 and 3 p.m. ET. David Hale, the undersecretary of State for political affairs and Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of Defense for Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs, will be testifying in the afternoon session.</p>
      <p>The hearings will be broadcast live on CSPAN, CNN, Fox News and other cable news channels. CBS, NBC, ABC and PBS are also expected to carry the hearings live.</p>
