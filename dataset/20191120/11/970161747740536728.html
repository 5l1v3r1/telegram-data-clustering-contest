      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>’s chances of signing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/erling-haaland/">Erling Haaland</a> in January have suffered a blow because the striker’s father wants him to join a Bundesliga side, reports say.</p>
      <p>The RB Salzburg star is one of the most <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/18/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-speaks-exciting-erling-haaland-10767586/">coveted players in Europe</a> after scoring 26 goals in just 18 appearances this season.</p>
      <p>United, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Juventus have all been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/manchester-united-willing-loan-erling-haaland-back-rb-salzburg-complete-transfer-11166265/">credited with a transfer interest in Haaland</a>.</p>
      <p>However, <i>Bild</i> claim the 19-year-old’s father is unconvinced a move to a major European club is the right decision.</p>

      <p>United want to agree a deal to sign Haaland in January, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/erling-haalands-father-visits-carrington-amid-manchester-united-transfer-speculation-11176147/">Alf-Inge Haaland</a> has advised his son to snub the move to Old Trafford in favour of a switch to Germany next summer.</p>
      <p>Haaland’s father wants his son to play regularly and is keen for him to join a smaller side to ensure a starting place.</p>

      <p>The preferences of his father could be a big boost for RB Leipzig, who are owned by the same company as Salzburg and have a history of swapping players with the Austrian side.</p>
      <p>Leipzig reportedly have the option to sign Haaland for £27million and remain eager to land the teenager even with bigger clubs circling.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to spend in January and has earmarked a new forward as his priority target.</p>
      <p>United are prepared to back their manager in the winter transfer window, but will only sanction mega-deals if their key targets become available.</p>
      <p>As well as Haaland, United are tipped to make a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/manchester-united-optimistic-of-completing-185m-double-deal-for-jadon-sancho-and-erling-haaland-11177372/">formal approach for Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho in January</a>.</p>
