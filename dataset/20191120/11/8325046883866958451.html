        <li>Britain’s <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meghan-markle">Duchess of Sussex</a> may be married to the Queen’s grandson, but that doesn’t mean she gets to cut corners when applying for her British citizenship.</li>
        <li>Even though Prince Harry’s communications secretary said <a href="https://www.insider.com/is-meghan-markle-a-british-citizen-2018-7">Meghan Markle intended to become a British citizen</a> after their engagement in 2017, Markle is yet to receive her citizenship.</li>
        <li>“It might seem extraordinary, given that she’s been married to the Queen’s grandson for 18 months, but she accepts that it’s a slow process,” a friend of the duchess told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7692341/Meghan-Markle-waiting-British-citizen.html">Mail Online.</a></li>
        <li>According to official <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-spouse">government guidelines</a>, you have to have lived in the UK for three years before applying for citizenship, on the grounds that your spouse is a British citizen.</li>
        <li>If the duchess is following this procedure, that means she might not be eligible to apply until 2020.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meghan-markle">The Duchess of Sussex</a> is still waiting to become a British citizen, even though she moved to the UK two years ago.</p>
      <p>After Meghan Markle’s engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, his communications secretary Jason Knauf said the former actress would be <a href="https://www.insider.com/is-meghan-markle-a-british-citizen-2018-7">“compliant with immigration requirements at all times.”</a></p>
      <p>He added that the process will “take a number of years.”</p>
      <p>Since then, there has been no official update from Buckingham Palace on the status of Markle’s application, or whether she has even started the application process at all.</p>

      <p>A friend of the duchess’ told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7692341/Meghan-Markle-waiting-British-citizen.html">Mail Online</a> this week: “Meghan is not yet a British citizen.</p>
      <p>“It might seem extraordinary, given that she’s been married to the Queen’s grandson for 18 months, but she accepts that it’s a slow process.”</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-spouse">official government guidelines</a>, you are eligible to apply for citizenship on the grounds of your spouse being a British citizen if you have lived in the UK for at least three years before the date of your application.</p>
      <p>It is believed Markle officially <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13820879/meghan-markle-moved-to-london/">moved to London</a> after she finished filming “Suits” in November 2017. Therefore, if Markle is following this procedure, she may not even be eligible to start her application process until late 2020.</p>
      <p>She will also legally be required to take the <a href="https://www.tsoshop.co.uk/Society/Life-in-the-UK/About-the-test/?TRACKID=002353">Life in the UK Test</a>, which covers a number of topics on local customs and traditions, the history of the UK, laws, and the political systems that govern the country.</p>
      <p>This is a completely different process to the one she will have to follow to give her son, Archie Harrison, dual citizenship.</p>
      <p>Although Archie was born in the UK, Harry and Markle <a href="https://www.insider.com/will-harry-meghan-royal-baby-be-american-or-british-dual-citizenship-2019-4">are entitled to apply for American citizenship for their son</a> at the US Embassy in London.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://uk.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/birth/transition-requirements/">US Embassy &amp; Consulates in the United Kingdom</a>, a child born in the UK is eligible to apply for a US citizenship, as long as “the US citizen parent has been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a period of five years, two of which were after the age of fourteen.”</p>
      <p>They will need to present a number of important documents, including the child’s birth certificate, their marriage certificate, and evidence of Markle’s US citizenship in person at the embassy.</p>
      <p>However, it is yet to be confirmed by Buckingham Palace whether Harry and Markle have submitted an application for Archie.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond when contacted by Insider for comment.</i>
