      <h1>Plymouth Argyle boss Ryan Lowe issues warning to Bristol Rovers ahead of FA Cup clash</h1>
      <h2>The manager was a pundit during the Bromley vs Bristol Rovers game last night</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle boss Ryan Lowe has issued a warning to Bristol Rovers ahead of their FA Cup clash.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mini-fist-pump-player-ratings-3555674">The Gas narrowly saw off Bromley</a> last night in the FA Cup first round replay after a disappointing draw at the first time of asking.</p>
      <p>Jonson Clarke-Harris scored the only goal of the game in the first half as he bundled home an Ollie Clarke cross.</p>
      <p>Rovers were under pressure from Bromley for large periods of the game, with the home side having a goal disallowed for a dubious offside decision.</p>
      <p>Rovers will face Argyle in the next round on December 1, and Lowe, who was on punditry for the game, has warned Rovers about their performance.</p>

      <p>When asked if there were a few clues for how Rovers might approach the Argyle game, Lowe said: "Yeah there's plenty.</p>
      <p>"I know <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graham-coughlan-says-bristol-rovers-3555921">Graham has said it wasn't an entertaining game</a> and they'll play a little bit more football than they did tonight.</p>
      <p>"They're going to have to play better than that to come up against a Plymouth Argyle team."</p>
      <p>Rovers recent performances haven't been convincing but they continue to grind out results, and it appears as if Lowe thinks Plymouth will have enough to see them off.</p>
      <p>Rovers lost against Argyle on penalties in the EFL Trophy earlier in the season but won at Home Park during pre-season.</p>
      <p>Lowe had praise for Rovers at half time. He said: "The Rovers defenders have been putting their bodies on the line. Big (Tony) Craig has been getting his head on everything."</p>
      <p>It will be an emotional game for Rovers boss Graham Coughlan, who is an Argyle legend after spending four years at the club.</p>

      <p>He made 193 appearances for the Pilgrims, scoring 26 goals, but is focusing on getting through to the third round.</p>
      <p>When asked if the game against Argyle was a good chance of getting through, he said: "I wouldn't say that.</p>
      <p>"They're a big club, a tough club. They're flying and playing really well and we'll have to play a lot better than tonight if we are to stand any chance."</p>
      <p>Coughlan and Lowe had a long chat post match, no doubt discussing the performance and the upcoming meeting of their two sides.</p>
