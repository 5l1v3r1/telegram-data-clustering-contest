      <p>Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is betting against mall owners.</p>
      <p>Sources told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carl-icahn-placing-a-big-bet-against-mall-owners-11574201244">The Wall Street Journal</a> that Icahn can potentially gain $400 million or more if mall owners aren’t able to service their debt. In fact, traders said that Icahn likely is now the largest short seller of mall debt.</p>
      <p>But not everyone has lost faith in malls, with two of the largest money managers, <a href="https://www.putnam.com/?mkey=1003201186&amp;msrc=74775122592&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oeiYQwrg8FtQjqHwKLsA81j6s3Jf9Guf2p9LXdsEItrFqfKXeG7w0IEaAtTkEALw_wcB">Putnam Investments</a> and <a href="https://www.alliancebernstein.com/">AllianceBernstein Holding LP</a>, holding a more positive outlook for the industry. The competition is “the biggest battle in the mortgage bond market today,” said Dan McNamara, a principal at MP Securitized Credit Partners, a New York hedge fund. There are more than $10 billion of potential profits at stake on the direction of an index called CMBX 6, which tracks the value of 25 commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), including mall debt.</p>
      <p>Icahn has reportedly been buying insurance contracts called credit-default swaps, which give holders protection against CMBS defaults. When investors bet on a rise in mall defaults, they buy the contracts, which causes the index to decline. Icahn then makes money when the index drops.</p>
      <p>Although Icahn has lost millions so far, sources say that he isn’t giving up on the long-term, since his contracts will pay off if landlords have a hard time paying back their debt by 2022. It’s important to note, however, that despite the fact that many malls and shopping centers have seen a decline in tenants in recent years, data shows that only three of around 40 malls and shopping centers linked to the CMBX 6 have been delinquent on their loans since 2012.</p>
      <p>Retail malls have also been looking at <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/retail/2019/retail-malls-look-for-new-innovations-commerce-and-otherwise/">innovative</a> ways to lease out their space. Mall of America in Minneapolis, America’s largest mall, recently announced plans to open a 2,300-square-foot walk-in clinic in November with medical exam rooms, a radiology room, lab space and a pharmacy dispensary service. And Simon Property Group, the largest mall operator in the United States, will invest $5 million in Allied Esports, which describes itself as “a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities.”</p>
