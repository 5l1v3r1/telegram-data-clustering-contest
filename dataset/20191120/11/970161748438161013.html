      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</a> Extra Camp co-host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adam-thomas/">Adam Thomas</a> creeped viewers out last night as he appeared to chat someone up on-camera in a segment for the show.</p>
      <p>The former Emmerdale actor was filming a segment for the spin-off show, showing viewers a sneak peek at an upcoming trial, Just Desserts.</p>
      <p>The married presenter seemed to get distracted, however, by the crew member, Molly, who was showing him around behind-the-scenes.</p>
      <p>‘Right, first things first,’ Adam said. ‘What’s your number?’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It was all fun and games, of course, and the segment quickly got back on track – giving viewers a glimpse of what’s to come for the first eating challenge of the new series.</p>
      <p>It was announced that this year’s contestants <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/im-a-celebrity-bosses-ban-live-insects-from-bushtucker-trials-after-animal-rights-backlash-11165998/">won’t be chowing down on live bugs in any eating trials</a>, and this will be a permanent change for the show after an animal rights backlash.</p>
      <p>Some viewers took to social media after the programme to blast the new presenter for his on-camera flirting techniques, however, with one fan branding the actor ‘creepy.’</p>

      <p>‘Adam Thomas hitting on the trial woman and his whole encounter with her was just creepy,’ one fan wrote.</p>
      <p>Another added: ‘Adam Thomas! Bit inappropriate.’</p>
      <p>One eagle-eyed viewer also helpfully pointed out that whilst attempting to flirt on camera, the Waterloo Road star had his wife, Caroline, son Teddy and daughter Elsie-Rose sitting at home.</p>

      <p>Adam is one of the newest presenters on spin-off show Extra Camp, he and fellow ex-campmate Emily Atack joined the show this year to present alongside comedian Joel Dommet.</p>
      <p>There was some controversy, however, over the replacing of host (and former Queen of the Jungle) Scarlett Moffat, who was replaced by Atack and was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/scarlett-moffatt-axed-dream-ant-decs-saturday-night-takeaway-job-11178959/">announced to have been dropped from her ‘dream’ job</a> as a co-presenter on Ant and Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.</p>
      <p>In other news from last night’s show, pop singer Nadine Coyle <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-reveals-why-shes-not-friends-with-girls-aloud-anymore-11183751/">opened up to Kate Garraway about her relationship with her fellow Girls Aloud bandmates</a>.</p>
