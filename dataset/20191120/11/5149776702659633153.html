      <p>All the magic of Santa's North Pole - including Northern Lights, an enchanted ice cave, talking polar bear and singing reindeer - is being recreated as part of an interactive Yuletide experience opening ahead of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>.</p>
      <p>A team of elves have been working hard to transform the National Forest Adventure Farm, near Burton on Trent, into an <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/things-to-do-in-nottingham">arctic wonderland</a> - and it's only a 50 minute drive from Nottingham.</p>
      <p>Now in its third year, two new experiences have been added to the North Pole Adventure for 2019. One is helping the Master Time Keeper, whose job it is the make sure everything in Father Christmas’ home town runs smoothly and to ring the bells for Pudding Time. The other is working with the Head Toy Maker Elf to fix his present-making machine.</p>
      <p>Taking place on November 23, 24 and 30, and December, 1, 7, 8, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23 and Christmas Eve, tickets start from £22 in advance for children and £16 in advance for adults, from adventurefarm.co.uk.</p>

      <p>The experience lasts around one hour and 45 minutes and starts with walking through a magical portal to the home of Father Christmas. Visitors will then be able to explore the Victorian High Street complete with sweet shop, where they can spend their elf coins on their choice of sweets and hot chocolate.</p>
      <p>Families will also be able to help the elves sort parcels and fix the sleigh, meet a magical talking polar bear under the Northern Lights, and decorate gingerbread with Mother Christmas before meeting Father Christmas and stopping off at the Present Room to collect a gift.</p>
      <p>Also returning for 2019 is the Music Room, which features a singing reindeer who is in a muddle and needs the children’s help with musical notes so he can find his voice.</p>
      <p>Owners Ivor and Tom Robinson say the North Pole Adventure, which attracted more than 13,000 visitors last year, promises to be a fun, immersive attraction that takes in all the sights, smells and sounds of the magical Christmas season.</p>
      <p>“It’s getting better every year and we can hardly wait to see everyone’s excited faces when they see what we have in store for them this Christmas,” said Ivor.</p>
      <p>“It’s a joy to create this attraction and we’ve worked really hard to make it an even more fabulous experience for all the family, with more super activities and, of course, the opportunity to meet Father Christmas himself.”</p>
