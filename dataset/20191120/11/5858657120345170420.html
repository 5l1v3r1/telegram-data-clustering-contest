      <p>COPENHAGEN — Low-cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle says it has tapped a new chief executive to succeed Bjoern Kjos, who turned the small domestic carrier into a global airline over 17 years as its CEO.</p>
      <p>Board chairman Niels Smedegaard says Jacob Schram was chosen “after a thorough search process,” and he will start Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>Smedegaard said Wednesday that Schram, 57, has held managing roles with fast food chain McDonalds, consultancy McKinsey, and Norwegian energy company Statoil Fuel and Retail. When Canadian group Couche-Tard acquired Statoil Fuel and Retail in 2012, Schram was the company’s European head until he stepped down in 2018.</p>
      <p>In July, Kjos announced he was retiring, saying he is “way over on overtime.”</p>
