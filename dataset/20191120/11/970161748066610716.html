      <p>If you’re expecting a baby next year, you might still be struggling for a name.</p>
      <p>Apparently gender-neutral <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/baby-names/">baby names</a> are going to be a trend next year so it might be worth considering one for your little one.</p>
      <p>Perfect for parents who want to keep the sex of their baby a surprise until he or she is born, or just for those who want something a little different.</p>
      <p>Looking at the trend, brand <a href="https://www.jojomamanbebe.co.uk/littleextras/baby/18-gender-neutral-baby-name-ideas/?wgu=2487_54264_15742461102953_b9a449c2ee&amp;wgexpiry=1576838110&amp;utm_source=webgains_jojo&amp;utm_medium=22278&amp;utm_campaign=54264&amp;utm_term=Skimbit%20LTD">JoJo Maman Bébé has created a list of names</a> that suit a girl or a boy that they think could be popular next year.</p>
      <p>They are just names that they’ve chosen to fit with the gender-neutral trend, rather than based on research or statistics, but the list offers some ideas for parents-to-be.</p>
      <p>They said: ‘Unisex names are more popular than ever – which could be because we’re breaking down gender boundaries or we’re just more likely to be set on a name before we find out whether we’re having a boy or a girl.</p>

      <p>‘This naming trend looks like it’s here to stay, and if you need a little inspiration for your next baby, look no further.’</p>
      <p>Top of the list was River, which they said has traditionally been male but has become more popular for girls too.</p>
      <h3>Gender-neutral names for 2020</h3>

      <p>Other names included Quinn, Rowan, Aubrey and Remi.</p>
      <p>Some of the names appeared on the list of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/29/popular-baby-names-2018-10649860/">most popular boys’ names in the UK in 2019</a>, including Max, Teddy, Jude and Albie but JoJo Maman Bébé suggests considering them for either gender.</p>
      <p>The name Evelyn appeared on the most popular girls’ names list this year but it could be used for boys too. JoJo Maman Bébé says that it used to be a predominantly male name, for example, in the case of writer Evelyn Waugh.</p>
