      <h1>Leni declines to see PDEA list of HVTs</h1>

      <h3>VICE PRESIDENT Leni Robredo yesterday declined to see a list of “high-value” targets  about to be presented to her by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency saying she wants to be clarified first on the scope of her authority as co-chairman of the Inter-Agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs, the Journal Group learned.</h3>
      <p>A highly-reliable source said that top PDEA officials led by her ICAD co-chairman, Director General Aaron N. Aquino were about to present the top secret list to the VicePresident but she herself stopped them from making her see the document at the PDEA board room.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, the Vice President went to the Dangerous Drugs Board office where, after a meeting with top DDB officials, she confirmed that she declined a classified briefing from the PDEA top brass until President Duterte clarified the scope of her authority.</p>
      <p>“I refused kasi sabi ko hihintayin ko muna yung sagot ni presidente sa aking clarification. Yung ayoko yung ma-accuse ako na lumalampas ako sa aking mandato,” she said.</p>
      <p>She also said that President Duterte should just tell her to leave as co-chair of ICADif he was not trusting her.</p>
      <p>“Dapat diretsuhin na lang ako. Direcho naman akong kausap... Kung ayaw na niya, kung nagkamali sya sa pag-appoint sa kin at gusto niyang bawiin, sabihin lang niya. Kasi ako, madali akong kausap,” she said.</p>
      <p>Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa said it would be good for the Vice President to focus on improving the government’s advocacy and rehabilitation program when it comes to fighting drugs and just leave the arrest and prosecution of offenders to the subject experts which are the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency, the PNP and the Department of Justice.</p>
      <p>According to the PNP-OIC, they will also adhere to what the PDEA will do when it comes to the Vice-President’s request to have access to the list of ‘high-value targets’ or HVTs.</p>
      <p>“Remember, the PDEA is the head of the law enforcement cluster... Whatever the head says, I will always respect it being a member of the law enforcement... So yes, I adhere to what the Director General says,” Gamboa told newsmen at Camp Crame after unveiling part of the over P3 billion worth of newly-procured police equipment including helicopters, patrol vehicles, machine guns and pistols.</p>
