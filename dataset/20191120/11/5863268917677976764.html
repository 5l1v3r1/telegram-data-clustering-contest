      <p>LONDON (Dunya News) – Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif is staying at the Sharif family’s apartment in Avenfield after reaching London and his personal physician Dr. Adnan is accompanying him.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo’s first appointment with doctors at the Harley Street Clinic has been scheduled for today and his various medical tests – including blood, sugar levels, heart, and kidneys – will be conducted.</p>
      <p>It has been learnt that the doctors will decide whether to move Nawaz Sharif to America or not after examining his reports. On the other hand, Dr. Adnan told that the erstwhile premier’s health has improved.</p>
      <p>PML-N President and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif talked to media and maintained that Nawaz Sharif reached London due the prayers of the nation. Hassan Nawaz said the foremost priority at present is his father’s health and avoided giving any political statement.</p>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif – along with younger brother Shehbaz – had on Tuesday arrived at London’s Heathrow Airport in an air ambulance where he was welcomed by his son Hassan Nawaz, other family members and friends.</p>
