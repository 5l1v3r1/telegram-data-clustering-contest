      <p>All the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/parenting/">parenting</a> points in the world to Sarah Balsdon, who just made the home we dreamed of as kids a reality.</p>
      <p>Sarah, 29, managed to transform the conservatory of her home into an incredible soft play area, complete with its own ball pit and slide.</p>
      <p>Sarah and husband Kyle were able to complete the renovations in secret, only revealing the finished room to the youngest of their four children, Elijah, on his second birthday.</p>

      <p>The thrifty mum-of-four stuck foam tiles to the floor then attached strips of material to the ceiling to make the conservatory look more like a circus.</p>
      <p>Then it was time for superhero wallpaper, soft play equipment bought online, and a pit filled with second-hand balls.</p>

      <p>Sarah, a nurse, said the entire project cost less than £500.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘We recently moved house and will eventually be extending out the back so didn’t want to spend too much.</p>
      <p>‘I wasn’t sure what to do with the space and that’s when I came up with the soft play idea.</p>
      <p>‘We have curtains leading out onto the conservatory and we kept them closed so we could surprise Elijah on his birthday.</p>

      <p>‘He was so excited and his little face was a picture.</p>
      <p>‘The first thing he did was dive in the ball pit and then go down the slide.</p>
      <p>‘It’s nice as well because the other children are still at an age where they can enjoy it.</p>
      <p>‘It was actually really easy to do and has definitely earnt me some mum points.’</p>
