      <p>The Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) has defended a Navy officer who shot and killed a Boda Boda operator over trespass in Mtongwe Army Quarters.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, KDF stated that the man who has been identified as a 19-year-old, Leonard Komora, attempted to gain forceful entry into the restricted area before he was shot twice.</p>
      <p>“Today at around 6:00am, a motorcyclist was shot dead as he tried to force his way into Kenya Navy’s Lt Col Kimaro Estate.</p>
      <p>“The motorcyclist was flagged down by sentries to identify himself but forcefully proceeded towards the main gate at a high speed, even after a warning shot was fired, ” the statement signed by P M Njuguna, the Colonel KDF Public Affairs, reads in part.</p>
      <p>He succumbed to his injuries thereafter.</p>

      <p>“This prompted one of the soldiers on guard duties to fire two direct shots at the intruder in an attempt to immobilize him but he succumbed to his injuries, ” said Njuguna.</p>
      <p>The KDF said investigations are underway to establish the motive behind the attempted forceful entry.</p>

      <p>Earlier, local Boda Boda operators castigated the Navy officer for killing an innocent man saying it was not the first time they were accessing the area.</p>
      <p>They said it’s normal for them to pick and drop customers, mostly Navy officers, in the area.</p>

      <p>Ali Khamisi, who knew the deceased, however, said the soldiers sometimes harass them.</p>
      <p>“The only customers that we usually pick are the soldiers themselves, but we usually suffer in the hands of these people,” Khamisi told <i>Nation</i>.</p>
      <p>Komora’s mother, Martha Njeri Munene, called on speedy investigation into the incident saying her son was not a criminal and didn’t deserve to die.</p>
      <p>“This is unfair. They have killed my son for no good reason. He was my only son. He was the one providing for me,” she said.</p>
