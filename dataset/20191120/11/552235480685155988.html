      <h2>William Finlay confessed to neighbours after the frenzied knife attack on 44-year-old Fiona McDonald in Falkirk.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:46:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author">Dailyrecord.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/killer-told-cops-should-shot-20579091">man who murdered his neighbour</a> by stabbing her 47 times in a row over his £10,000 pension money was today jailed for life and ordered to spend at least 17 years behind bars.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/man-murdered-falkirk-gran-vicious-20562051">William Finlay</a>, confessed what he had done to neighbours and police and claimed he should 'be shot in the head” for the brutal killing of grandmother 44-year-old Fiona McDonald, who was also known as Fiona Canning.</p>
      <p>He admitted murdering her in her flat in Camelon, Falkirk, in November last year.</p>

      <p>Sentencing Finlay at the High <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/man-appears-court-accused-raping-20912111">Court</a> in Glasgow  judge Lady Stacey told him: “Nothing can take away the grief her family feel. Her mother, daughter and grandchildren have been deprived of her company.</p>
      <p>“It is not up to me to decide when, if ever, you will be released, that is up to the parole board.”</p>
      <p>The court heard that Finlay, who was made redundant after 20 years from a job in international electronics, came back to Falkirk to look after his mother.</p>
      <p>He became friends with Ms McDonald but it was a volatile relationship.</p>
      <p>In March 2018 Finlay took £10,000 out of his pension pot and by November that year he was £1,300 in debt to the housing association for his rent.</p>

      <p>Defence QC Thomas Ross said: “They had a very complicated relationship. At times they were friends and other times they had violent disagreements.</p>
      <p>“Mr Finlay, who latterly worked as a cleaner in banks and financial institutions, drew a pension payment for £10,000 in March, 2018 and was in debt to the tune of £1,300 by that November.</p>
      <p>“Fiona McDonald had accrued debts and men were turning up at his door looking for money. He believed she had built up debt with drugs using him as credit.</p>
      <p>“It is unusual for someone with no history of violence to behave in such a brutal fashion.”</p>
      <p>Mr Ross described the attack on Ms McDonald as “brutal and sustained.”</p>

      <p>Finlay, 57, from Falkirk, told police, who questioned him, that he was pushed to his limits and could not apologise enough for killing someone, but said it was 'revenge.”</p>
      <p>He said he believed she had been “rinsing him” of his £10,000 pension payment. <br/> </p>
      <p>Prosecutor Margaret Barron said: “He stated to witnesses that she had been 'rinsing him' and was constantly asking for money.”</p>
      <p>The court heard that Finlay, who was covered in blood, turned up at a friend's house and confessed to the murder.</p>
      <p>When Finaly left his house the friend dialled 999.</p>
      <p>Finlay also told neighbours: “I've just murdered Fiona.”</p>
      <p>When they rushed to her flat they saw her seated on a couch “just staring into the sky,” with blood all over her body.</p>

      <p>A small kitchen knife was found  near to her body.</p>
      <p>Finlay when arrested told police officers: “Junkies bothering me, that's why I got my revenge.</p>
      <p>“I took it out on a poor woman who robbed me for thousands of pounds.</p>
      <p>“I deserve to be shot in the head for what I've done tonight.</p>
      <p>"I apologise for doing it, but you can't apologise for killing someone – this is what happens when you get pushed to the limits.”</p>
      <p>Finlay showed no emotion as he was led away to begin his sentence.</p>
