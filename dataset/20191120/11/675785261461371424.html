      <h1>How Tottenham could line up under Jose Mourinho following ex-Man Utd boss's appointment</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese took over from the sacked Mauricio Pochettino in a surprise appointment on Wednesday morning, and will take charge of Saturday's trip to West Ham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:05:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Well that escalated quickly.</p>
      <p>Just as the world was waking up to digest even more of the fallout from Mauricio Pochettino's sacking as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur boss on Tuesday evening, Spurs went straight out and appointed Jose Mourinho on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> manager takes over in North London on a three-and-a-half year contract, and arrives with Spurs down in 14th place in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He'll begin with a London derby at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday, and while thoughts are sure to soon turn to which players he'll eventually sign for the club, that lunchtime clash could see a return for some familiar faces.</p>

      <p>The likes of Toby Alderweireld and Christian Eriksen have been involved in something of a standoff with the club over a refusal to sign new deals, but with Mourinho's tendency to prefer more established players in his teams, it would be no surprise if the Portuguese turned to those two from the start at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>With caution often coming naturally to him, Mourinho could opt for a hard-working midfield of Harry Winks and Moussa Sissoko playing just behind Tanguy Ndombele, with the summer signing perhaps allowed to flourish further forward.</p>

      <p>Ahead of him then Harry Kane is sure to be one of the first names on Mourinho's teamsheet, with his admiration for the forward often apparent during his United days.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min could also play off the left, with the likes of Dele Alli, Lucas Moura and Giovani Lo Celso ready to be introduced from the bench.</p>

      <p>Mourinho's team is sure to change during his time in charge at Spurs, but with West Ham in a poor run of form then he'll hope his selection is enough to get him off to a winning start.</p>
      <p>Whoever he picks it promises to be a riveting watch.</p>
