      <h1>GBP/JPY off lows, still in the red below 140.00 handle</h1>

      <p>The GBP/JPY cross held on to its offered tone through the mid-European session on Wednesday, albeit has managed to rebound around 30 pips from daily lows.<br/> <br/>A combination of negative forces exerted some follow-through selling for the second consecutive session on Wednesday and dragged the cross farther from five-month tops, levels just above mid-141.00s set at the beginning of this week.</p>
      <h3>Trade uncertainty adds to the selling bias</h3>
      <p>Despite the fact that the incoming election polls have been indicating a majority for the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party, the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">British pound</a> seemed struggling to attract any meaningful buying interest.<br/> <br/>This coupled with reviving demand for the safe-haven Japanese yen, supported by the global risk-aversion trade amid persistent US-China uncertainty, further collaborated to some follow-through long-unwinding trade on Wednesday.<br/> <br/>In the latest developments, the US President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to raise new tariffs on Chinese imports if the ongoing trade negotiation fails while the US Senate passed a bill in support of Hong Kong.<br/> <br/>This was seen fueling tension between the world's two largest economies and weighed on the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">market sentiment</a>, which was evident from a weaker tone around equities and provided a goodish lift to traditional safe-haven currencies.<br/> <br/>Despite the pullback, the cross has managed to hold above mid-139.00s and in absence of any major market-moving economic releases, remains at the mercy of any incoming UK political headlines/broader market risk sentiment.</p>
