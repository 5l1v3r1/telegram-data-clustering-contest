      <p>Swissquote is looking to diversify its suite of tradable options by adding Vanilla FX Options on its Advanced Trader platform. The latest launch helps continue the Swiss online bank’s trend of providing its customers with more opportunities for foreign exchange trading.</p>
      <p>Launched back in 2010, Swiss has seen its Advanced Trader platform continue to add more functionality and options over the past decade.</p>

      <h4>New options granting greater latitude for traders</h4>
      <p>In particular, Swissquote’s new options are available for 45 currency pairs. Looking closer at the new options, Swissquote has opted for an emphasis on diversification and optimized FX strategies.</p>
      <p>This includes FX options tailored to an individual’s trading strategy with expiry dates set to specific days, up to one year. Normal options providers require expiry dates under more broad ranges, such as weekly, monthly, or annualized.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the new FX options are ideally situated to diversify and hedge individuals’ trading risk in currencies, as well as those who are looking to engage in multiple strategies to benefit from as many market trends as possible.</p>
      <p>Following the addition of the new options, Swissquote’s Advanced Trader Platform will now offer approximately 80 tradable currency pairs. These include major, minor and exotic currencies.</p>
