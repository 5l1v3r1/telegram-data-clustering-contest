      <p>The company said in a statement that Asian customers aged between 31 and 34 had been most accurate in matching their needs in finance to actual capabilities. This age group was said to obtain financing closest to the amount they requested.</p>
      <p>Applicants aged 18 to 24 showed to be less accurate with only 7.9 percent, meanwhile the eldest age group 51 to 60 had an accuracy of 12.3 percent.</p>
      <p>Specifically for Indonesia, customers aged between 25 and 30 demonstrated the best accuracy. As for applicants aged 18 to 24, they turned out to be less precise with only 4.5 percent accuracy, while customers aged 51 to 60 recorded an accuracy of 18.9 percent.</p>
      <p>Based on the data, the company said, ”Millennials were the first users of online financing tools in Asia. Unlike Generation X and Baby Boomers, they have felt more at ease trying digital services. As a result, they have obtained a deeper understanding of how fintech works and better financial literacy.” (jes/kes)</p>
