      <p>Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Athiya Shetty starrer <i>Motichoor Chaknachoor</i> has been in the news ever since its announcement. The film released last week and came out as a huge disappointment for the audience. The critics weren’t quite impressed with the film and director Debamitra Biswal blamed producer Rajesh Bhatia for the same.</p>
      <p>Motichoor Chaknachoor’s director said that the producers ruined her film and even went on to ask the audience not to watch the film. Now, the writer of Nawazuddin Siddiqui – Athiya Shetty starrer film, Bhupendra Singh aka Megh has shown his support to Debamitra and disowned the film.</p>

      <p>In a conversation with SpotboyE, Bhupendra said, “It wasn’t fair to keep Debamitra, the director of the film, out of the editing process. It has impacted the film and I believe if they let her be on the table, the end product would have been 40 percent better. Ismein koi shaq nahi ki Chandan Arora ne jo editing ki thi, woh zyada acchi thi. Aaj bhale hi logo ko picture achi lag rahi ho, maine bhi 2 baar dekhi hai, kal jab main gaya toh theatre 75 percent bhara tha, log enjoy bhi kar rahe the, lekin yeh enjoyment aur hota agar director editing mein involved hota.”</p>
      <p>Bhupendra also opened up about the controversy and confirmed that there was an ego clash between producer and the director. He revealed that because of the clash, 200-300 other people associated with the film suffered as well. He said that regardless of the differences, the entire team worked hard and delivered the product which was a good film till the time they were shooting.</p>
      <p>“Man-mutaav tha, definitely tha. Hum mein se koi aapko premiere mein dikha? It says it all that there was a big ego-clash. But film bahut aachi shoot hui thi, actors ne bhi bahut aacha kaam kiya tha. However, we all know that how a film turns out always depends on the edit table. Jab aap woh table hi cheen loge toh koi kya karega? Yeh wahi baat ho gayi ki aapne rasoi mein aacha khaana banaya, aacha cooking oil use kiya, sab theek kiya but table par dish pahuchi toh usmein kisi ne gandagi daal di. Ismein aapki galti kaise hai?” added Bhupendra.</p>
      <p>He added, “Mujhse pehle toh Nawaz ko aur bade logon ne bola hi hoga, aur shayad unhone kuch initiative internally liya bhi ho, jo humein na pata ho. But jab producer kisi ki sunne ko tayaar hi nahi toh koi kya kar lega.”</p>
      <p>Supporting Debamitra, Bhupendra said, “Ek director ka vision uska hi hota hai. No one can replace that. Debamitra ke saath bilkul galat hua. I have been a part of her journey for 4 years, kyunki neev daalne ka kaam toh writers hi karte hai, uske baad bhale hi imaarat par unka naam aaye na aaye. It was a long struggle for her, and unfair to anyone. ”</p>
      <p>Bhupendra was genuinely disappointed with the results and credited the producers for the doing.</p>
