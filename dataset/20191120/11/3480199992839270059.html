      <p>According to one report, the programme peaked at seven million viewers between 8.50pm and 8.55pm.</p>
      <p>ITV said that Johnson v Corbyn: The ITV Debate, hosted by newsreader Julie Etchingham, was watched by a peak of 1.1 million 16-34 year olds.</p>

      <p>The leader of the Conservatives clashed with the Labour leader over their rival plans for Brexit during the heated debate, with Mr Corbyn describing the Prime Minister’s pledge to “get Brexit done” by the end of January as “nonsense”, while Mr Johnson suggested his rival was “not fit to lead our country”.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn also contested issues concerning the NHS and a further referendum on Scottish independence in the first televised debate of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>There are further leaders’ events planned ahead of the election, with the BBC hosting a Question Time special on Friday.</p>
