      <h1>Alleged P&amp;ID scam: Briton applies for bail variation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:50:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/364227-alleged-pid-scam-briton-applies-for-bail-variation.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>A Briton, James Nolan, on Wednesday applied for variation of his bail at the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that EFCC had, on October 21 arraigned Mr Nolan and Adam Quinn (at large), both British nationals, over their alleged complicity in the $9.6 billion judgement against Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Process and Industrial Development (P&amp;ID), an Irish engineering company, had secured the award against Nigeria following the non-execution of a 20-year gas and supply processing agreement (GSPA) the company had with the federal government.</p>
      <p>The arraignment of the two British nationals came weeks after two P&amp;ID directors were convicted over the deal.</p>
      <p>The defendants, both directors of Goidel Resources Limited, a Designated Non-Financial Institution (DNFI) and ICIL Limited, were arraigned on a 16-count charge bordering on money laundering.</p>
      <p>Justice Okon Abang had, on Nov. 7, admitted Mr Nolan to a bail in the sum of N500 million.</p>
      <p>Justice Abang, who granted the bail in an application filed by Mr Nolan, ordered that the applicant must produce “a surety in like sum, who must be a Nigerian and a serving senator not standing any criminal trial in any court in Nigeria.”</p>
      <p>At the resumed trial on Wednesday, counsel to the defendant, Paul Erokoro, prayed the court to favourably grant their application for bail variation.</p>
      <p>The lawyer also told the court that he was not prepared for the commencement of trial due to inability to have adequate access to his client.</p>
      <p>The EFCC, through his lawyer, had informed the court that he was ready to commence the trial earlier slated for today.</p>
