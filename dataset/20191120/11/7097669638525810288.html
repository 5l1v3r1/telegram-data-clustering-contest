      <h1>Sewer campus escape bid by Hong Kong protesters ends in arrest</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong (AFP) - Two pro-democracy protesters were arrested Wednesday as they emerged from a manhole on a Hong Kong road outside a besieged campus, in a thwarted escape bid from inside the university.</p>
      <p>Two male protesters holed up in the campus for days were detained along with four people lowering ropes to help them out from the drainage system, police said.</p>
      <p>They apparently crawled through fetid sewers to a manhole outside a housing estate around half a kilometre from city centre grounds of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), the scene of the dramatic siege by police.</p>
      <p>The group were arrested for a range of offences including "taking part in a riot" and "assisting offenders", chief superintendent Ricky Ho told reporters late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dozens of diehard pro-democracy protesters are believed to still be inside PolyU, running out of supplies and options to avoid the police cordon around the campus.</p>
      <p>Some have made successful and daring escapes -- shinning down ropes and jumping on waiting motorbikes, or making a run for it under the cover of darkness.</p>
      <p>Protesters have also scouted out the drainage system for two days -- with desperation and rumours of successful escapes prompting students to try the dangerous underground route.</p>
      <p>The city's fire service said that as of Wednesday evening, "no person has been found trapped inside the (sewer) system."</p>
      <p>But many others have been arrested while trying to breach police lines, some receiving brutal beatings with batons, fists and kicks to the head while prone on the ground.</p>
      <p>Dozens of those who made the Monday night breakout by ropes off a bridge were subsequently arrested, police said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been rocked by nearly six months of demonstrations against the city's China-backed government.</p>
