      <p><b>Best answer:</b> If you want to buy the Galaxy Note 10, we'd recommend doing so directly from Samsung's website. Every model of the phone is available, along with all of the offered colors. However, feel free to shop around at your preferred carrier or another online retailer if you want to get an idea of all the various sales and promotions.</p>

      <p>There are a lot of places selling the Galaxy Note 10, but at the end of the day, we think <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293382-12001245-1428599469000%3Fsid%3DUUacUdUnU77988YYw%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fmobile%252Fgalaxy-note10%252Fbuy%252F&amp;token=8wo--h23">Samsung</a> is the best place to get the phone at. Why? There are a few reasons for this.</p>
      <p>For starters, every color variant of the Note 10 is being offered — including the Nebula Blue hue that's carried exclusively on Samsung's website and at Best Buy. A lot of carriers only offer a handpicked selection of colors for the Note 10, so if you want access to all of the available options when you go to make your purchase, Samsung is the way to go.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Samsung's website sells just about every variant of the Note 10 you could ask for.</p>
      <p>Want to buy an unlocked Note 10? Samsung's website lets you do that. If you'd prefer to buy a carrier version, you can get Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and U.S. Cellular flavors of the phone, too.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more important, Samsung is famous for offering excellent deals.</p>
      <p>Right now, Samsung's giving away four months of free YouTube Premium and six months of free Spotify Premium access for all Note 10 orders, along with other carrier-specific savings.</p>
      <p>If you have an old phone you plan on upgrading from, you'll also want to take a look at Samsung's increased trade-in values. Samsung's touting that you can pick up the Note 10 for as little as $690 with an eligible trade-in, and the Note 10+ for $840. You can pay the total cost upfront on Samsung's site, or use Samsung Financing and make payments over the course of 24 months with 0% APR.</p>
      <h3>Keep an eye on what your carrier is offering, too</h3>

      <p>Alternatively, if you'd rather buy the Note 10 through your wireless carrier or have been thinking about switching, it's also worth taking a look to see what those companies are offering. Just about every major carrier in the U.S. is selling the Note 10, including:</p>

      </ul>
      <p>In regards to carrier-specific deals, AT&amp;T is offering up to $950 in bill credits when you trade-in a qualifying phone and transfer your number with a new line of service. That's a lot of hoops to jump through, but it effectively gives you a Note 10 for free. Over in Camp Verizon, you can snag a $200 Prepaid MasterCard when switching to a Verizon Unlimited plan and another $550 or $200 credit when you trade-in an eligible phone.</p>
      <p>Moving over to Sprint, the yellow-clad carrier is offering a sizable discount on Note 10 or Note 10+ when you get either phone on an 18-month Sprint Flex lease — allowing you to get the Note 10 for $15/month and the Note 10+ for $20/month with $0 down on both phones.</p>
      <p>Lastly, T-Mobile is giving away a Note 10 for free when you buy another Note 10 and add a qualifying line of service. Additionally, you can trade-in your existing phone and get up to $400 back.</p>
      <p>If you live in Canada, you'll also find wide carrier availability of the Note 10. You can buy the phone at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rogers is giving customers the chance to grab the Note 10+ for $0 down with 0% interest and no taxes upfront — so long as you get it on a Rogers Infinite plan and use Edge Financing. Telus also has a good deal, allowing customers to grab the Note 10+ for $0 down and saving $100 on its price when buying online. After activating the phone, you'll also get a $65 bill credit over the course of two months and not have to pay the usual $35 activation fee.</p>

      <p>If buying phones from a carrier isn't your thing, Samsung also makes unlocked variants of its phones widely available in the U.S.</p>
      <p>In addition to being able to get the Note 10 unlocked through Samsung's site, we also recommend buying through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Factory-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B07V5KSWXM?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU77988YYw">Amazon</a>. If you have an Amazon Prime membership, this will ensure you get free 2-day shipping on your order so you can get your hands on the Note 10 ASAP.</p>
      <p>To help sweeten the deal, Amazon has a bundle that allows you to get a free Galaxy A20 smartphone when buying the Note 10 or Note 10+ (a $250 value).</p>
      <h3>Ultimate note</h3>

      </h4>
      <p>This year's best Note.</p>
      <p>The regular Note 10 is a great phone, but if you want the ultimate experience, we recommend splurging for the more powerful Note 10+. It has a bigger display with a higher resolution, longer battery life, a Time-of-Flight camera on the back, and has a microSD card slot.</p>

      <p>The regular Note 10 makes some sacrifices (most notably its lack of expandable storage) to achieve a lower price tag, but for people that want the cheapest Note out there, it's still worth a look.</p>

      <p>If you live in an area that already has access to a 5G network, it might be worth looking into the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G. Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny if you get it.</p>
