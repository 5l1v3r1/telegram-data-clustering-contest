      <p>"Saint André (a cow's milk soft cheese similar to brie made in Normandy) is one of my favorites. It's a great value for the flavor and the scent instantly transports me back to France. It's so rich it's essentially halfway between butter and cheese. I always give it a featured spot on any cheese plate." — Lindsay Miller</p>
      <p>"It's the perfect balance of creamy and pungent, and it fancies up any cheese plate. It's also about half the price at TJ's than anywhere else!" — Mandy Harris</p>
      <p>"IT'S SO GOOD. So creamy, so rich, so cheap." — Candace Lowry</p>
      <h3>2 Trader Joe's Italian Truffle Cheese ($12/pound)</h3>

      <p>"This semisoft cheese has just the right amount of truffle — it's earthy and aromatic without being overwhelming. It's also amazing melted into a grilled cheese!" — MH</p>
      <p>"My friends and I are OBSESSED with the truffle cheese!!! Whoever is in charge of the cheese plate is required to buy at least three." — Carla Hawkes</p>
      <h3>3 Trader Joe's Creamy Toscano Cheese Soaked in Syrah ($8/pound)</h3>

      <p>"I love the goat cheese sampler! Because there are different flavors, they make a great entertaining snack. I put them out with little toasts and crackers, olives, and deli meats, and they're always a hit." — Brinton Parker</p>
      <h3>5 Trader Joe's Parmesan Reggiano ($12/pound)</h3>
      <figure>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"When it comes to cheese, I do have a type: salty, hard cheeses like parmesan and pecorino. I top every bowl of <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Spaghetti-Garlic-White-Wine-Sauce-Recipe-41758413">garlicky pasta</a> with a generous dusting of freshly grated parmesan cheese, and I always get Trader Joe's Parmesan Reggiano. This type of cheese is pricey, but Trader Joe's version — which is imported from Italy — is always affordable. I snack on this on its own or add to any number of Italian recipes." — Erin Cullum</p>
      <h3>6 Trader Joe's Pesto Gouda ($10/pound)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/0avWxYyX07AkN9DcFKjHdksdns0/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/10/12/869/n/1922195/3058a9da0e0553f8_cheese5/i/Trader-Joe-Pesto-Gouda-10pound.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>"Well, this is the hardest decision I've had to make, but I have to go with pesto gouda. I would honestly have never thought to eat these two together since I defer to mozzarella every time I have pesto, but it's soooooo delicious on its own or on basically anything." — Samantha Netkin</p>
      <h3>7 Trader Joe's Cheddar Cheese With Caramelized Onions ($9/pound)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4AfgzidnJuXgtCmYY-DjAao97_Q/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/10/12/869/n/1922195/6a17c77690e19e54_cheese6/i/Trader-Joe-Cheddar-Cheese-Caramelized-Onions-9pound.jpg"/>

      <p>"Trader Joe's Cheddar Cheese With Caramelized Onions was a hit at my New Year's party last year. The cheese itself is pretty mild, but the onions give it a savory-sweet taste that's so irresistible. It paired so well with a glass of Champagne!" — Victor Verdugo</p>
      <h3>8 Trader Joe's 1,000-Day Gouda ($12/pound)</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/fcIKexxgMs7Z1VTW7WUjinaXgpo/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2016/10/12/869/n/1922195/4c2b5bb3e7a72fa5_cheese8/i/Trader-Joe-1000-Day-Gouda-12pound.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>"This gouda is perfectly aged: it has a nutty taste and those delicious small crystals aged cheeses form, but it still has a creamy texture and finish. It's awesome with TJ's medjool dates or with a smear of quince paste." — MH</p>
      <h3>9 Trader Joe's Havarti Cheese With Dill ($7/pound)</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"Havarti is a pretty mild, soft cheese, so the addition of fresh dill gives it a total flavor upgrade. I love the tiny specks of green herbs throughout the cheese. Slices of this cheese go really well with sandwiches or grilled cheese." — EC</p>
      <h3>10 Trader Joe's Triple Creme Brie Cheese ($7/pound)</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>"OMG — the cinnamon-dusted toscano. I still dream of this seasonal item. It's as easy to eat as a cheddar, but boasts the elegance of a parmigiano. The cinnamon gives it a festive feel. I'm dying to get my hands on it again so I can test it in macaroni and cheese!" — Emily Orofino</p>
      <h3>12 Trader Joe's Extra Sharp Canadian Cheddar Cheese ($9/pound)</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"The only cheddars I'm a fan of are supersharp ones, and this Canadian cheddar cheese is one of the best. It's aged over two years and has a strong bite to it, perfect for serving on cheese plates or grating for homemade mac and cheese." — EC</p>
      <h3>13 Trader Joe's Blueberry Vanilla Chevre and Cranberry Chevre ($4)</h3>

      <p>"I love their wild blueberry and vanilla goat cheese. It's tangy and fruity, and the cheese is smooth and creamy. It's the perfect combination and goes well with crackers, bread, or salad!" — Christen Nino De Guzman</p>
      <p>"I used to think all cheese was created equal — as in I'm not the least bit picky and love every single type — but the Cranberry Chevre Log has changed all that. The cheesy taste paired with tart cranberries and salty crackers is a combination I can only describe as magical. Once it's out, I really can't stop eating it, and I make sure it's on the list for every holiday gathering." — Samantha Sutton</p>
      <h3>14 Trader Joe's Dutch Smoked Gouda Cheese ($5/pound)</h3>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"The smoked gouda is something I keep stocked in my fridge at all times. It's an affordable and uniquely smoky snacking cheese (yes, rind included), but I also love incorporating it in recipes like omelets and mac and cheese." — AMR</p>
      <h3>15 Trader Joe's Marinated Fresh Mozzarella ($5)</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"I don't really get my hard cheeses from TJ's but I love, love Trader Joe's Marinated Fresh Mozzarella. The mozzarella balls are marinated in olive oil, basil, and other herbs so they're perfect alone or paired with some bread and olives." — Nicole Yi</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"Similar to parmesan, asiago is a hard cheese that's nutty and salty. I love the earthy flavor of the outer coating of rosemary and olive oil. I like to serve this cheese with prosciutto, castelvetrano olives, and wheat crackers." — EC</p>
