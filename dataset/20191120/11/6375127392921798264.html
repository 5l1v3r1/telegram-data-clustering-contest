      <h3>“MEDIA is fortunate in having Sal (Salvador Panelo) who loves engaging them. We never contradicted each other,” Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said  in defense of the Presidential Spokesperson who was recently criticized for speaking on Philippine foreign policy.</h3>
      <p>Locsin tweeted “Senators asked why Sal Panelo also speaks on foreign policy when only President and Secretary make foreign policy. Two reasons: 1. He is (the) presidential spokesman and shares with media President’s thoughts including on foreign policy. The President and I make foreign policy. 2. I am constrained by military/diplomatic sources for info; so I cannot react to media.”</p>
      <p>The Secretary described Panelo as someone who stands by the President “through thick and thin” and sticks his neck out for him (President) when he is unfairly treated by media.</p>
      <p>Locsin admitted he had “never been a media people person” as his colleagues witnessed during the administration of then-President Cory Aquino and in Congress.</p>
      <p>During the deliberations on the proposed 2020 budget of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Monday night, some senators questioned if Panelo acted as “secondment to DFA” and claimed that some of his remarks were “contradictory” to Locsin’s position.</p>
      <p>In reaction, the presidential spokesperson disagreed that there was any contradiction between their functions and statements because he always deferred to Locsin on matters of foreign policy.</p>
      <p>He said there has never been any inconsistency between the functions of the DFA and the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson.</p>
      <p>“We find it amusing that the DFA and our office are being pitted against each other when in truth and in fact our offices have always acted in a complementary way,” Panelo added.</p>
