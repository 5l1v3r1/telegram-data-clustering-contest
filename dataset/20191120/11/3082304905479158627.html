        <b>Back in the Premier League and with a point to prove, we look back on the peaks and troughs of Jose Mourinho’s colourful managerial career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been given a shot at Premier League redemption with Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Almost a year on from his acrimonious exit from Manchester United, the two-time Champions League winner has an unexpected chance to prove his best work is not confined to the past.</p>
      <p>As the Special One aims to rise again, we reflect on the highs and lows of a managerial career full of highlights and high drama.</p>
      <p>
        <b>HIGHS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Upstaging the elite with Porto</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho made his name at Porto, where he orchestrated perhaps the most unlikely Champions League triumph of the 21st century. Deco and Ricardo Carvalho were among the stars of the side that overcame future employers United, Lyon and Deportivo La Coruna en route to a meeting with Monaco in Gelsenkirchen. An emphatic 3-0 win secured Mourinho the continent’s most coveted trophy in just his second full season in charge and laid the foundation for a silver-tinged future.</p>

        <b>Tripletta treat</b>
      </p>
      <p>Inter snapped up Mourinho in June 2008, less than a year on from his initial split with Chelsea. It proved a perfect marriage of two tempestuous forces. After cantering to the Scudetto at the first attempt, Mourinho set his sights on guiding the Nerazzurri to greater heights in 2009-10. He did that and then some. Inter pipped Roma to the title, won the Coppa Italia and, after stunning Barcelona in the Champions League semi-finals, Mourinho scaled Europe’s highest peak for the second time, a 2-0 defeat of Bayern Munich crowning a magnificent treble.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Madrid make history</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho’s decision to depart San Siro for the Santiago Bernabeu brought little immediate success as Real Madrid claimed only the Copa del Rey in an underwhelming 2010-11 campaign. Cristiano Ronaldo had grander plans and his 46 goals the following season fired Los Blancos to a LaLiga title, their one and only under Mourinho. Most impressive was the team’s final tally of 100 points, at the time a LaLiga record.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The best of the rest</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a January 2019 interview with beIN SPORTS, Mourinho suggested some would call him “crazy” for regarding a second-place finish with United as one of his greatest achievements. On reflection, it seems a reasonable assertion. United might have finished 19 points adrift of champions Manchester City in 2017-18 but now, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer struggling to cobble together a team fit for Europe, finishing above Spurs, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal appears an admirable feat.</p>

        <b>LOWS</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Chelsea return ruined</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parting ways with Chelsea once must have been painful enough for a manager who won worldwide recognition in his first Premier League job. To leave in ignominious circumstances a second time surely rankles among his greatest regrets. The Blues described Mourinho as a “much-loved, respected and significant figure” after relieving him of his duties in December 2015 but it was clear that not all held the same affection for him. Mourinho suggested he felt “betrayed” by his players amid a miserable beginning to their title defence, leaving a stain on his Stamford Bridge legacy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Problems with Pogba</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho arrived at United at the same time as Paul Pogba and together the pair were supposed to lead a renaissance. Instead, they became caught in a vortex of middling results and worse relations. Mourinho’s failure to extract the best from Pogba on the pitch, and their frosty exchanges off it, portrayed a manager unable to elevate top-class talent. His treatment of Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial attracted further criticism and echoed the sort of strained relationships that were apparent in Madrid, Mourinho having notably not seen eye to eye with Iker Casillas.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Down and out at United</b>
      </p>
      <p>Never before his exit from Old Trafford had Mourinho departed a club without winning a league title. Several were expected when he took charge of the Red Devils in 2016 and, though the resources of neighbours City reframed the standard measure of success, trophies in the EFL Cup and Europa League fell short of the brief. Mourinho stakes his reputation on winning major honours, not friends, yet he left with few of either when United called time on his reign almost 12 months ago. A playing style deemed unacceptable by supporters only contributed to the sense that the new Tottenham boss squandered an opportunity he keenly coveted. He will hope to avoid a repeat.</p>
