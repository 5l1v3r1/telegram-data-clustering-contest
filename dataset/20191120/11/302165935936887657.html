      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 20 — Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has admitted today that he will consider a Cabinet reshuffle, after several critics suggested that under-performing ministers led to Pakatan Harapan’s loss in Tanjung Piai.</p>
      <p>Despite that, he assured the public that there will be no radical changes before Malaysia hosts the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) Summit scheduled in November next year, as such a drastic change will be problematic.</p>
      <p>“The thing is, if we have a change midstream, it will be very confusing. It will create a lot of problems,” he said after chairing Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia’s Supreme Council meeting here.</p>
      <p>“But of course, if I’m sacked [then] I don’t know. But I think I need to be serious about this. What happens to me is not something important, but what happens to the country is very important.”</p>
