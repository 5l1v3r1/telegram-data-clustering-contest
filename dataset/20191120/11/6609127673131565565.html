      <p>A Police Scotland spokesperson said: "Around 10am on Wednesday, November 20, the body of a man was found in a wooded area near to Stevenson Street, Oban.</p>
      <p>"The man has not yet been formally identified however it is believed to be Alex Carter who had been reported missing in the early hours of today.</p>
      <p>"His family have been informed.</p>
      <p>"The death is not being treated as suspicious and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal."</p>
      <p>Police described Alex as a “loving family man” who loved the outdoors and cycling.</p>
      <p>And they said his loved ones were left “distraught” by his disappearance.</p>
      <p>His family had reported him missing after he failed to return home last night.</p>
