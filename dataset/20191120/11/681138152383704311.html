        <b>A second and third man have been charged in connection with a quarter-of-a-million drugs seizure at a Suffolk scrapyard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both men appeared before magistrates this week following their arrests in connection with an undercover police operation, which culminated on land in a village near Ipswich in September.</p>
      <p>Christopher Southart, 33, of Valley Road, Harwich, was arrested by officers from the cyber, intelligence and serious organised crime directorate in Flowton, near Somersham, on Wednesday, September 11.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old pleaded not guilty to possession with intent to supply more than two kilogrammes of cocaine when he appeared at Ipswich Crown Court on Friday, October 11.</p>
      <p>Southart is alleged to have been in possession with intent to supply 2.2kg of cocaine <b>-</b> thought to have a street value of between £200,000 and £250,000.</p>
      <p>He was remanded in custody at HMP Chelmsford until a trial scheduled to begin on February 24.</p>
      <p>Paul Fenton was arrested at the same time as Southart and subsequently charged with permitting the production of cocaine at Camperdown Pit scrapyard.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old, of Gaell Crescent, Hadleigh, denied the charge at Suffolk Magistrates' Court on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He appeared in the dock alongside Kevin Parr, of Alexandra Street, Harwich, who gave no indication of plea to conspiring to supply cocaine with co-defendant Southart, and with possession with intent to supply cannabis.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old was arrested in Harwich on September 12 with a 61-year-old woman, who was subsequently released under investigation.</p>
      <p>Police said a further two kilos of cannabis and 10 kilos of the cutting agent benzocaine were seized at the time.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Wayne Ablett invited magistrates to send the case of Fenton and Parr to the crown court, where a date has been fixed for the trial of Southart.</p>
      <p>He said conspiracy to supply class A drugs was an 'indictable only' offence and must be dealt with under the higher jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Ellie Carter, for Parr, made no representations as her client and Fenton were released on bail to appear for a preliminary hearing at Ipswich Crown Court this Thursday, November 21.</p>
