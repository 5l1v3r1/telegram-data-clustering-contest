      <p>Many people have been affected by boil, at times it causes sleepless nights and at times, the pain is subtle.</p>
      <p>According to Greatist News, boils generally form when pus collects under your skin, centered on a hair follicle. When this is due to an infection, it’s known as a furuncle. Boils are not always due to an infection and can happen in a condition known as Hidradenitis suppurativa.</p>
      <p>Boils most often form where there’s friction, sweat, or hair. The neckline, face, armpit, and, yes, butt crack are some common hot spots.</p>
      <p>Below are some home remedies for treating boil:</p>
      <p><b>Heat</b><br/>A warm compress applied to a boil can help facilitate drainage of the boil. This is very vital in healing a boil and should be your first course of action.</p>
      <p>The American Academy of Dermatology suggests soaking a washcloth in warm water and applying it to the area for 10 to 15 minutes, three or four times a day. This will help break down the pus from within.</p>
      <p><b>Castor Oil</b><br/>This oil is made from the castor bean plant, this oil contains ricinoleic acid, a fatty acid that may help break down trapped bacteria.</p>
      <p>Castor oil has been used since ancient times to heal wounds and moisturize skin. Apply castor oil directly to the boil three times a day until the boil is gone.</p>
      <p><b>Turmeric</b><br/>Turmeric’s main compound and active ingredient is curcumin, which has anti-inflammatory properties and may help combat an infection if one is present in the boil.</p>
      <p>An oral turmeric supplement that contains black pepper extract can be taken as this helps the body absorb more curcumin.</p>
      <p>Turmeric can also be applied to your skin. Try adding a few drops of turmeric essential oil to a cream or oil-based moisturizer-such as argan oil-and use it as you would your regular moisturizer.</p>
      <p>Always remember to visit your doctor if the boil becomes regular.</p>
