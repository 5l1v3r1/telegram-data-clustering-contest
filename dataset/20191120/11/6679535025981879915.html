      <p>Market benchmark Sensex rose 182 points to end near its record peak on Wednesday, led by strong gains in Reliance Industries, Sun Pharma and IndusInd Bank.</p>
      <p>After scaling a lifetime (intra-day) high of 40,816.38, the 30-share index ended 181.94 points, or 0.45%, higher at 40,651.64.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty closed just shy of the 12,000 mark, advancing 59 points, or 0.49%, to end at 11,999.10.</p>
      <p>Reliance Industries led the gains on Sensex, settling 2.47% higher after it touched its life-time high of ₹1,571.85 (intra-day) after the company’s telecom arm, Reliance Jio, announced tariff hikes in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Among other gainers, Sun Pharma rallied 5.73%, IndusInd Bank 5.50% and Yes Bank jumped 2.65%.</p>
      <p>L&amp;T, Maruti, Tech Mahindra, ITC and PowerGrid too ended on a positive note.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Kotak Bank dropped 1.49%, HDFC fell 0.87% and Tata Steel slipped 0.83%. HUL, SBI and Bharti Airtel too finished with losses.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul settled significantly lower after US President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that failure to get a trade deal with China will prompt more tariffs.</p>
      <p>European equities were also trading on a negative note in their respective early deals.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Indian rupee depreciated 15 paise to 71.86 against the US dollar in intra-day trade.</p>
      <p>Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, slipped 0.11% to USD 60.84 per barrel.</p>
