      <h2>A former Sandwell Council boss has refused calls to apologise after six cabinet secretaries were wrongly suspended.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:11:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/jamie-brassington/" target="_blank">Jamie Brassington</a></address>
      <p>Yvonne Davies, leader of Sandwell Council, said Steve Eling <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2019/11/07/council-leader-calls-for-predecessor-to-apologise-over-staff-suspensions/">should apologise over the suspensions</a>, which happened in January 2018 under Mr Eling's leadership..</p>
      <p>An independent investigation - which concluded in October - found that the staff members, who were secretaries to cabinet members, <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2019/10/24/sandwell-council-apologises-after-six-cabinet-secretaries-wrongly-suspended/">were wrongly suspended.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Eling, who is no longer a serving councillor, denied he had any involvement.</p>
      <p>After the investigation concluded, councillor Davies said it was highly likely that Mr Eling was involved in the talks, which lead to the suspensions.</p>
      <p>Mr Eling responded by <a href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/politics/2019/11/01/former-sandwell-council-boss-to-launch-complaint-against-leader/">making an official complaint against Councillor Davies with Sandwell Council</a>, claiming she was "breaching standards in public life".</p>
      <p>Councillor Davies then responded by calling for Mr Eling to apologise, and questioned his ethics, asking: "Why is he not outraged at the injustices?"</p>
      <p>Now Mr Eling has said: "What I say to her is 'people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones'.</p>
      <p>"I haven't seen this report [made from the independent investigation] so I don't know what it says.</p>
      <p>"But I have written to the council and I have been told in writing that it does not place any responsibility on members, including me.</p>
      <p>"As far as I and cabinet members were concerned, it was a proper process being undertaken properly.</p>
      <p>"Her making that statement then in relation to me and my ethics from her position as leader is an abuse of that office.</p>
      <p>"I know only too well what it means to be in that role and how you have to be careful what you say,</p>
      <p>"I have referred that abuse in addition to the ethical standards complaints I have already put in against her."</p>
      <p>Mr Eling was suspended from Labour in January over a complaint, of which the details have still never come to light.</p>
      <p>He then resigned as council leader in February and was replaced by Steve Trow, who served as leader for a short period before stepping down.</p>
      <p>In May, Mr Eling stepped down as a councillor, while councillor Davies was elected council leader, after defeating Ann Shackleton by 35 votes to 33 in May.</p>
