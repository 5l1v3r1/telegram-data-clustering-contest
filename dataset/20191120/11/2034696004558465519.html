      <p>Ahead of the tour, she’s also released a new Spotify singles session – which sees her offering an unexpected grunge take on Simple Minds’ ‘Don’t You Forget About Me’. Check that out below.</p>

      <p>Last month, the singer released her ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/beabadobee-space-cadet-ep-review">Space Cade</a>t’ EP, which NME described as “the makings of a grunge icon” in a glowing five-star review.</p>
      <p>Our review stated: “‘Space Cadet’ builds on Bea’s astute songwriting and is a bold revolution for another bright young artist showing off Gen Z’s attitude to take something tried-and-tested and give it a new lease of life. Judging by this effort, she’s poised to become a hero in her own right.”</p>
