      <p><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> has just announced that they’re cutting support for <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/cortana/">Cortana</a> on both Android and iOS devices as of January 31, 2020. The digital personal assistant was an alternative to assistants like <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/bixby/">Bixby</a> and <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/alexa/">Alexa</a>. Cortana will now be integrated into the Microsoft 365 productivity apps. Once support has stopped, reminders, lists and other content created will no longer function in the app, but will always be available in Cortana on Windows.</p>
      <p>Microsoft also said that all reminders, lists and tasks will be synchronized with the Microsoft To Do app, which can be installed on both platforms.</p>

      <p>Once support officially ends, Microsoft will also release a new Launcher app without Cortana. The information was released in support articles for the UK, Australian, and Canadian markets, so it’s currently unknown if this will also affect the US market and others.</p>
