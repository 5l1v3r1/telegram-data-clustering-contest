      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): Amway (Malaysia) Holdings Bhd’s net profit was down by 38.1% to RM10.61 million or 6.46 sen per share in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19), from RM17.15 million or 10.43 sen per share on softer response to sales and marketing promotions.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue fell 9.66% to RM235.07 million from RM260.21 million, a filing with the local stock exchange showed today.</p>
      <p>Despite lower earnings, the group declared the same dividend per share of five sen for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19), payable on Dec 20.</p>
      <p>For the nine months of FY19, its net profit remained on the growth path and expanded 21.9% to RM39.72 million or 24.16 sen per share from RM32.59 million or 19.82 sen last year. Revenue slid 1.38% to RM713.33 million from RM723.31 million.</p>
      <p>The higher earnings in the nine-month period was attributed to lower import cost benefiting from favourable foreign exchange impact.</p>
      <p>On prospects, the group expects revenue in the remainder of the year to improve on the back of the new sales incentive plan launched in September 2019, barring unforeseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the group is expecting its annual revenue to stay flat.</p>
      <p>“The group will continue to enhance its sales and marketing strategies and provide more ABO (Amway Business Owner)experience-related infrastructure to support the ABO’s business, while exercising prudent cost management,” said Amway.</p>
      <p>Amway’s shares closed eight sen or 1.34% lower at RM5.87 today, valuing the company at RM964.94 million.</p>
