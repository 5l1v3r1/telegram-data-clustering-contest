      <p>The phase of period dramas has taken over Bollywood big time. We recently saw the trailer of Ashutosh Gowariker’s Panipat and yesterday we were treated with a glimpse of Om Raut’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior. The film is a tribute to the courage and valour of Subhedar Tanhaji Malusare, a well renowned warrior in India’s history. Akshay will be playing the titular role in the movie and Kajol will be seen as his wife Savitribai Malusare.</p>

      <p>Yesterday, the trailer was launched in the presence of the cast but Kajol was nowhere to be seen at the launch event. During the launch, director Rohit Shetty revealed the reason behind her absence. He said, “Jab aap film dekhege, history dekhege ki jab bete ki shaadi hone wali hai aur woh war par nikal jaate hain apna dharam nibhane ke liye, so, usi tarah se iss waqt Kajol jo hain woh singapore mein hain. Nysa (Devgan) ki jo padhai chal rahi hai toh woh wahan par hain, important meeting thi toh obviously koi ek parent ko jana tha toh she had to go (Kajol had to go to Singapore to attend a meeting at her daughter Nysa's school).”<br/><br/>Talking about the film, this project is specially close to Ajay Devgn as this will be the 100th time that we’ll be watching the actor on the big screen, a remarkable feat for any actor. In the film, Ajay will be seen going head to head with Saif Ali Khan, who’ll be playing the Charente of Uday Bhan.</p>
