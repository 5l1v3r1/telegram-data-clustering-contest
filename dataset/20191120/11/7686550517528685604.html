      <h2>Depletion of oestrogen in women aged between 45 and 55 increases the chances of getting pregnant with twins</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:31:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">Kayla Walsh, Amardeep Bassey</a></address>
      <p>Women approaching the menopause can still get pregnant and are more likely to have twins, according to an expert.</p>
      <p>Menopause expert and retired obstetrician/gynecologist Barbara Taylor M.D explained that a depletion of oestrogen in women aged between 45 and 55 increases the chances of getting pregnant with twins.</p>
      <p>She explained that the first symptom of menopause is irregular periods adding that women can suffer from "wacky" periods for between two and ten years.</p>
      <p>"Then you might start having a few other things that get your attention, like you’re not sleeping very well, you might be irritable," she told <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/life/contraception-menopause-pregnant-perimenopause-twins-20915171">RSVPLive</a> .</p>
      <p>"You might start getting a bit forgetful and your brain might get foggy, like you can’t think clearly. You've lost your oestrogen."</p>
      <p>Barbara warns that you can still get pregnant during perimenopause, before you lose your oestrogen - and you're actually more likely to have twins.</p>

      <p>"When you’re in perimenopause, the only thing that has changed is loss of progesterone," she said.</p>
      <p>"You can still get pregnant and the reason you can still get pregnant is if your periods are wacky, everything is wacky.</p>
      <p>"It’s like your hormones are on a rollercoaster. Oestrogen and progesterone and meant to have this perfect dance together. Suddenly one of the dance partners is gone.</p>
      <p>"The oestrogen doesn’t know what to do so the hormones start firing like crazy, sometimes high, sometimes low - that can stimulate your ovaries in a crazy way.</p>
      <p>"You ovulate occasionally, unpredictably, and you can get <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/pregnancy">pregnant</a> . It’s more common to have twins because everything is so wacky you can release two eggs."</p>
      <h3>Contraception</h3>
      <p>She said that in her career as a gynecologist, she dreaded telling women they were not actually going through the menopause - but pregnant with twins.</p>
      <p>"I would generally tell them while backed up against the wall, ready to leave the room if I needed to get out..." she joked.</p>
      <p>"These are women in their 40s, close to 50 and I have to tell them they are expecting twins - it's not an easy time for them!"</p>
      <p>She added that you have to use contraception if you want to avoid pregnancy before you fully reach the menopause.</p>
      <p>"You can get pregnant during perimenopause but once you lose all your oestrogen, your egg factory and your hormone factory, which is your ovaries, has gone out of business completely.</p>
      <p>"But you have to be fully there before you assume you can’t get <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/all-about/pregnancy">pregnant</a> ."</p>
