      <p>A new high-capacity gully is being installed in an area prone to flooding in Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>The 'super gully' will be a first for the county and is being added to Halam Road in Southwell by Via East Midlands.</p>
      <p>This type of gully - or channel - is described as being many times more efficient to remove water from flooding hotspots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-county-council">Nottinghamshire County Council</a> tweeted: "The team from Via East Midlands has been installing Nottinghamshireâ€™s first super gully at Halam Road in Southwell today!</p>
      <p>"The high capacity gullies are nine times more efficient and rapidly remove water from the road which is prone to flooding, making it safer for people to use."</p>
