      <p>Sharad Kelkar, on Tuesday, took us back to the controversy over Shivaji Maharaj's reference in KBC question at Tanhaji's trailer launch in Mumbai. When a journalist asked, “Sharad Kelkar, aap Shivaji ka role play kar rahe hai?” [In translation: Are you playing the role of Shivaji], the actor immediately interrupted and corrected her by saying, “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.” This act was applauded by everyone in the audience.</p>

      <h3>Row over Shivaji Maharaj's reference in KBC question</h3>
      <p>A question on quiz show Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC) on Sony TV, which had a reference to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, triggered a controversy and invited the charge that it showed "disrespect" to the 17th century Maratha warrior. Maharashtra BJP MLA Nitesh Rane on Friday demanded an apology from the entertainment giant for "disrespectful" reference to Shivaji Maharaj. Rane said, @sonykbc10 has insulted (Shivaji Maharaj) by referring him in first person singular form. It should tender apology at the earliest. Issuing a warning, he said, If they delay it (apology) further, the show will not have any life line to continue further.</p>

Among the four options, Chhatrapati Shivaji was mentioned as "Shivaji", while other options were Maharana Pratap, Rana Sanga and Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Irked with such a reference, several people took to social media to criticise Sony and seek an apology.</p>
