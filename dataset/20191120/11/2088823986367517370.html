        <i>This week, The Buffalo News recounts one of the most memorable storms to strike Western New York. <a href="https://buffalonews.com/topic/wall-of-snow/">Follow along daily</a>.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Residents searching for any sign of good news on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2014, didn’t get much.</p>
      <p>But there was plenty of bad news: It was still next to impossible to get around as roads remained impassable and driving bans remained in effect; in some places, that was extended to a walking ban; roofs on homes and businesses, including nursing homes, began to give way under the weight of the snow, now up to 7 feet in some places; the death toll climbed to 12.</p>
      <p>And there was the potential for worse news to come: Predicted temperatures in the 50s a few days later would almost surely mean that once people got out of their homes, they would need to get back in to deal with flooding.</p>
      <p>Amid all of this weather-induced trauma, the question that seemed to be occupying the minds of many was whether the Buffalo Bills would play at home as scheduled on Sunday against the New York Jets in snowed-in Orchard Park. By the end of the day, that question was settled when it was announced that the game would be played a day late and in Detroit.</p>
      <p>Frustration and desperation began to boil over on Thursday. Local officials, who were hearing complaints from snowbound residents, began bickering with each other and complaining that Erie County was not doing enough to clear the roads.</p>

      <p>They also blamed motorists for not heeding driving bans, a theme picked up by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and roundly criticized by those who said warnings of what to come were insufficient.</p>
      <p>Rosann Sessamen of Lackawanna may have summed up the situation best when she said: “I know it’s an act of God. But this is enough.”</p>
