      <p>Accra, Nov. 19, GNA - The Ghana Italian Women Association (GIWA) has donated laptops to St Aquinas Senior High School to help teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>Madam Baldi Leone Rosaria, the President of GIWA, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, said the items were donated through ST microelectronics to broaden the frontier of education through ICT in schools.</p>
      <p>She said the aim of the gesture was to exchange more knowledge on the computer science for effective teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>As part of the programme an IT expert and an Electronic Engineer are training the students on the operations of the laptops for four days.</p>
      <p>Madam Rosaria said the laptops would complement the existing ones in the school and help the student to conduct meaningful research for academic purposes.</p>
      <p>"We are working on donating to other schools in Saboba, Osu, Prampram to extend the scope of IT education across board", she added.</p>
      <p>Mr Paul Amoasi Baidoo, the Headmaster of the School, commended the Association for choosing the school out of the many for the donation.</p>
      <p>He said the Association is setting up an ICT centre in the school to train students and teachers from other schools.</p>
