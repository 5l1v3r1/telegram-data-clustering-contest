      <p>Stephen Kenny believes Ireland’s Under-21 European qualification destiny will come down to their final game against Italy.</p>
      <p>The former Dundalk manager has enjoyed a stellar first year as an international manager, leading the Under-21 side top spot in their pool with just three of the 10 fixtures remaining.</p>
      <p>Last night’s 4-1 victory over Sweden at Tallaght Stadium all but assures them of a top-two finish, which would at the very least clinch a play-off for the 2021 finals. Ireland have never qualified for an Under-21 major tournament.</p>
      <p>The strange dimension to Kenny’s ascent is that his final competitive games will be the double-header against Iceland and Luxembourg next March.</p>
      <p>Under a succession planning arrangement, Kenny will have succeeded Mick McCarthy in the senior role by the time of the final qualifier away to top seeds Italy on 13 October.</p>
      <p>“I think we will go to Italy to win the group in the final game,” said the Dubliner, looking ahead to next year’s demands.</p>
      <p>“The players have had a brilliant year. They’ve played seven qualifiers and five games at the Toulon Tournament in June.</p>
      <p>“Part of the job is developing players for the senior team and already some have been part of Mick’s squad. That’s great to see.”</p>
      <p>One of those is Troy Parrott, the striker who bagged Ireland’s third goal in the comeback win against the Swedes.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Tottenham Hotspur forward only linked up with the squad on matchday after McCarthy left him on the bench for their concluding Euro qualifier against Denmark 24 hours earlier.</p>
      <p>“We put a request in to see the lie of the land if he didn’t come on (against Denmark),” explained Kenny.</p>
      <p>“It’s an unusual sort of situation, not one I’ve been in before. When someone of his ability comes along, you definitely take him and play him.</p>
      <p>“We’d been working on other stuff in preparing for the game. Every throw-in you get, you’re working on stuff.</p>
      <p>“Because maybe Connor Ronan knows what we’re doing when we’re getting a throw-in, you retain possession. But every throw-in we were getting in the first half, we were giving it away. That was crazy stuff.”</p>
      <p>Kenny has no fears about the 17-year-old superstar being disrupted by the changeover in club manager from Mauricio Pochettino to Jose Mourinho. The Argentine granted Parrott his first-team debut in the League Cup in September.</p>
      <p>“Troy is very adaptable,” said his international boss. “Goalscorers are rare enough so you have to grasp them. He’s a natural instinctive goalscorer.”</p>
