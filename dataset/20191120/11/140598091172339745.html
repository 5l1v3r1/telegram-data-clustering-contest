      <p>This recipe requires a little bit of preparation, but once done it’s very simple and any excess can be frozen for a later date.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 15 minutes, plus overnight soaking time | <b>Cooking time:</b> 2 hours 20 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the ham hock:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 ham hock</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery</li>
        <li>1 onion, halved</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the risotto:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>30g butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed then chopped</li>
        <li>300g pearled spelt</li>
        <li>125ml white wine</li>
        <li>1 litre ham stock, reserved from cooking the hock</li>
        <li>50g frozen peas</li>
        <li>50g Wensleydale, grated</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Soak the ham hock overnight in cold water in the fridge.</li>
        <li>The next day, rinse off and place in a pan covered with fresh cold water. Bring to the boil. Skim off any scum that rises to the surface then add the carrot, celery, onion, bay leaf and thyme.</li>
        <li>Leave to simmer for about one-and-a-half hours until you can pick the hock up and the ham falls away from it.</li>
        <li>When cooked, reserve the stock and pick all the meat away from the bone. Cover the meat with a touch of stock and store both meat and reserved stock in the fridge.</li>
        <li>To make the risotto, heat the oil and butter in a pan and cook the onion and garlic until soft and translucent.</li>
        <li> Add the spelt and cook for two to three minutes, then add the wine to deglaze the pan.</li>
        <li> Cook until the wine disappears then start to add the ham stock a ladleful at a time. Wait until the liquid has disappeared before adding more, and stir regularly. It should take about 35 minutes to cook.</li>
        <li>About 20 minutes into the cooking time, add 200g of the shredded ham. To finish, stir through the peas and the wensleydale and serve immediately.</li>
