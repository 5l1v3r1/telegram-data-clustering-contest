      <p>During the market process, the market capitalisation of the company inched closer to the Rs 10 lakh crore mark. The oil-to-telecom company became the first company on Tuesday to go past the 9.50 lakh crore market cap.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday after the market hours, RIL announced that it will be raising phone call and data tariffs for the customers of its telecom arm Reliance Jio in the next few weeks in compliance with rules.</p>
      <p>“We understand that TRAI is likely to initiate a consultation process for revision of telecom tariffs. Like other operators, we will also work with the government and comply with the regulatory regime to strengthen the industry to benefit Indian consumers and take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments,” RIL’s Jio said in an <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/xml-data/corpfiling/AttachLive/572692a0-b213-4953-9e63-e08d1a7d3b81.pdf"><b>exchange filing</b></a> to the BSE.</p>
