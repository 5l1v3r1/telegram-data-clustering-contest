      <p>SEATTLE - The King County Council has approved an additional $100,000 in funding to buy bus tickets for homeless people who want to leave the area and reunite with their families elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The extra funding, backed by Councilmember Reagan Dunn, will nearly triple the amount now being spent by the county on family reunification efforts for the homeless. It was included in the $450 million supplemental budget OK'd by the full council on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In addition, the King County Executive's Office has committed to work on the design of a "Homeward Bound" family reunification program that would consolidate the effort under a single, dedicated program and perform outreach to raise awareness of the program among the homeless.</p>
      <p>According to data collected this year by King County, about 9% of homeless persons say that a bus ticket back to their families would enable them to obtain permanent housing.</p>
      <p>The same report also found that nearly half of the county's homeless residents had lived in King County for less than four years.</p>
      <p>"This funding allows us to offer stop-gap family reunification services while collecting data that will inform the design of a dedicated Homeward Bound program," Dunn said. "Considering that San Diego spends $1.2 million on their Homeward Bound program, ours will ultimately require a larger investment - but for now, this is a good start."</p>
      <p>Other cities have had success with similar programs that provide bus tickets for the homeless to return to their families, King County officials said.</p>
