        <b>The 'Parasite' director finds the sight "mentally difficult"</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Parasite</i> director Bong Joon-Ho has said he’d never direct a <a href="http://nme.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe">Marvel</a> movie because he can’t get on board with the “tight-fitting” costumes.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The South Korean director was talking to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/parasite-bong-joon-ho-success-next-movies-marvel-netflix-1203408123/"><i>Variety</i></a> about the breakout hit of <i>Parasite</i>, and was asked if he’d ever consider directing a Marvel film.</p>
      <p>“I have a personal problem,” his response began. “I respect the creativity that goes into superhero films, but in real life and in movies, I can’t stand people wearing tight-fitting clothes.</p>
      <p>The director continued: “I’ll never wear something like that, and just seeing someone in tight clothes is mentally difficult. I don’t know where to look, and I feel suffocated.</p>
      <p>“Most superheroes wear tight suits, so I can never direct one. I don’t think anyone will offer the project to me either. If there is a superhero who has a very boxy costume, maybe I can try.”</p>

      <p>Following the success of Parasite, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/bong-joon-ho-teases-horror-action-disaster-movie-2554167">Joon-Ho revealed last month that he’s currently working on two new films</a>, and that one of these is a Korean language “horror-action”.</p>
      <p>He explained: “I’ve had this idea since 2001, so I’ve been developing it for 18 years, and now I have an obsession. I really do have to shoot this movie…to give you one hint, it’s not a film you can shoot in NYC or Chicago: it only works if all the pedestrians on the street have the same skin tone.”</p>
