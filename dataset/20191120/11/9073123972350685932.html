        <b>Epic Games have announced that Fortnite Chapter 2’s debut season is going to be extended, making it one of the longest in the game’s history.</b>

      <p>Fans of the popular battle royale game had been expecting an announcement regarding more Christmas-themed content ahead of the holiday season anyway, potentially with a new season being built around a winter theme.</p>
      <p>However, not many could have predicted the bombshell the development team decided to land on November 20, publishing a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">blog post</a> to their website with details of a Season 2 delay.</p>

      <p>“With a new year comes new beginnings! Last year we celebrated 14 Days of Fortnite over the holidays. This year we’ve got even more content for you to unwrap, including new game features, free rewards and a live experience that you won’t want to miss,” it states.</p>
      <p>“To prepare for all the new holiday-themed updates, we will be extending Chapter 2’s first season into early February. Get ready for winter!”</p>
      <p>So, what did we learn? Well, there’s more than certainly going to be a whole host of Christmas themed content coming up, some of which has already been leaked in the form of skins and cosmetics following the v11.20 content update.</p>

      <p>The biggest change comes in terms of their schedule, though. This delay means that Chapter 2, Season 1 will have lasted around five months – much longer than anything we’ve seen in the past.</p>
      <p>What Epic has in store for us during the festive season remains to be seen, but with the next major update put very much on the back burner, the game’s online community will be hoping they step it up a gear in terms of new content for the foreseeable.</p>
