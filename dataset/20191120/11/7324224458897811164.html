      <h1>Wolves star Raul Jimenez shines for Mexico once again</h1>
      <h2>Wolves striker Raul Jimenez is heading back to Compton after keeping up his immense form with Mexico.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:18:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>After scoring twice in a 3-0 victory over Panama on Saturday, Jimenez came on in the 71st minute and set up Uriel Antuna against Bermuda to win the game 2-1 in stoppage-time – in the early hours of this morning.</p>
      <p>The triumph saw Mexico end the Concacaf Nations League group stage with a perfect record of four wins from four.</p>
      <p>Romain Saiss captained Morocco as they won 3-0 in Burundi in African Cup of Nations qualifying on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>That put Saiss &amp; Co joint top of the group, with Mauritania.</p>
      <p>Patrick Cutrone played the full 90 minutes for Italy U21s in a 6-0 rout against Armenia – but did not get on the scoresheet after scoring twice against Iceland at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Everton striker Moise Kean was at the double as Italy moved to second in their Euro qualifying group.</p>
      <p>Belgium enjoyed a 6-1 success against Cyprus, but Leander Dendoncker was an unused substitute for Roberto Martinez's side. Former Villa centre forward Christian Benteke bagged a brace for Belgium.</p>
      <p>Ruben Vinagre and Pedro Neto were not involved as Portugal U21s won 3-2 in Norway.</p>
      <p>The Wolves duo pulled out of the squad early with minor knocks and will be working at Compton as they look to play a part against Bournemouth, back in league action on Saturday.</p>
