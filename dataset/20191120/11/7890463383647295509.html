      <h1>Intel on track to take Samsung’s semiconductor crown in 2019</h1>

        <b>Intel is set to take the semiconductor supplier top spot in 2019, despite not making any more money than last year. In fact, it sold a little less. How’d it do it? It’s all down to the colossal dip in sales for Samsung and the wider memory manufacturing market as a whole.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Intel-To-Reclaim-Number-One-Semiconductor-Supplier-Ranking-In-2019--/">IC Insights</a> has published its forecasted end-of-year rankings for the top semiconductor companies worldwide. Intel is now in the number one spot, followed by Samsung, and TSMC – pure-play foundry to the stars (including AMD and Nvidia) – comes in third. Both Intel and TSMC gained positions in 2019, and each company has shifted up a single place in the table. Samsung and SK Hynix, however, have both dipped a rank.</p>
      <p>That’s all down to the significant dip in memory industry sales – DRAM and NAND – during the year. Average selling prices were down some 20% for just Q3 2019 alone according to <a href="https://www.dramexchange.com/WeeklyResearch/Post/2/9454.html">DRAMExchange</a>. The top 15 altogether are expected to lose out on 15% of their 2018 revenue when January 1, 2020 rolls around. SK Hynix, primarily a memory manufacturer, has been hit worst of all with a 38% plunge in sales revenue.</p>
      <p>But Intel, despite a shaky year of ongoing supply constraints and increased competition (especially for the title of <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/best-cpu-for-gaming-2019">best CPU for gaming</a>), has managed to weather the storm. Intel is forecast at roughly $69bn and change – just pennies below what it earned in 2018.</p>
      <p>Samsung sits at $55bn – down from $$78bn in 2018.</p>

      <p>TSMC is also set to gain in 2019 at $34bn, a marginal increase over 2018. The company is in charge of 7nm production for AMD’s Navi GPUs and Ryzen/EPYC CPUs, and is planning on expanding its advance process node manufacturing capability to meet growing demand.</p>
      <p>Nvidia also makes the list in 10th place. Since it’s reliant on TSMC to manufacture its chips, and <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/confirms-substantial-samsung-7nm-graphics-card-production">Samsung for its 7nm GPUs</a> next year, it will always act as a tributary for the larger foundries.</p>
      <p>Samsung usurped Intel’s top spot back in 2017, and managed to hold on to it 2018. Intel had previously held onto the semiconductor crown since 1993.</p>
