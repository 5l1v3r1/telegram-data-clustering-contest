      <h1>Twitter warns UK Tories over attempt to ‘mislead’ voters</h1>
      <h2>The party rebranded its press account ‘factcheckUK’ during a leaders’ election debate Tuesday night.</h2>

      <p>Twitter warned the U.K.'s Conservatives of future "decisive corrective action" if it again tries to "mislead" users over the nature of the party's accounts.</p>
      <p>The statement from the social media company was in response to the party's decision to<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/conservatives-rename-twitter-account-factcheckuk-then-switch-back/"> change the party's press account</a> name from “CCHQPress” to “factcheckUK” during a debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Tuesday night. Twitter users reacted angrily on the night at the apparent attempt to dupe people into thinking tweets from the account were from a neutral source.</p>
      <p>"Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information — in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate — will result in decisive corrective action," <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-election-twitter/twitter-says-conservatives-misled-public-minister-says-voters-dont-give-a-toss-idUKKBN1XU0RF?il=0">said</a> a Twitter spokesperson Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election ... we have global rules in place that prohibit behavior that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts," the spokesperson added.</p>

      <p>U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab replied to Twitter's criticisms on BBC Breakfast, saying that “no one gives a toss about the social media cut and thrust." He added that what people "care about is the substance of the issues, and of course there’s a huge amount of scepticism about the claims of all politicians.”</p>
      <p>Raab explained that "the clear intent was to be able to give instant rebuttal to the nonsense that is put around about our plans."</p>
      <p>“We want to make it clear that we’re holding Labour to account for the nonsense that they systematically and serially put out in relation to Conservatives,” he said.</p>
      <p>The U.K. Electoral Commission also issued a <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/media-centre/statement-cchqpress-twitter-rebrand">statement</a> Wednesday, saying that it "seeks to deliver transparency to the public through the political finance rules." But, it underlined that "we do not have a role in regulating election campaign content." It called on all campaigners in the election "to support campaigning transparency."</p>
