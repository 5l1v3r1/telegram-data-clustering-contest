      <p>Between 10 and 21 civilians have been killed by a notorious militia in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where government forces have vowed to root out rebel groups, civilian and security officials said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>More than half a dozen of the killings late Tuesday occurred in the city of Beni.</p>
      <p>The officials blamed the attacks on the Allied Democratic Forces, a militia of Ugandan origin targeted by a three-week-old government offensive in the region.</p>
