      <p>Dolly Parton’s hit musical 9 to 5 has landed in Dublin’s Bord Gais Energy Theatre and it is the perfect pick-me-up.</p>
      <p>Simply say the words “working 9 to 5” and you’d be hard pressed to find someone who won’t reply with “what a way to make a living.” The familiarity with Dolly’s music and career makes this hit musical a warm and comforting crowd pleaser.</p>
      <p>9 to 5 is based on the 1980s film of the same name and tells the story of workmates Doralee (Georgina Castle), Violet (Louise Redknapp) and Judy (Amber Davies), three women who are pushed to boiling point by their sexist and egotistical boss Franklin Hart Jr. (Sean Needham).</p>
      <p>Fed up, the women join forces and hatch a plan to kidnap their supervisor to give him a taste of his own medicine.</p>
      <p>Packed with catchy numbers, witty one-liners, slick set design and a stellar cast, it’s very hard to fault 9 to 5.</p>
      <p>Louise Redknapp was not performing on opening night, but her understudy, the extremely talented and seasoned performer Laura Tyrer, took on the role of Violet so effortlessly it didn’t take away from the audience’s enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Georgina Castle plays the extremely likeable Doralee Rhodes, and captures the essence of Dolly Parton’s southern country spirit with ease. Expect a lot of laughs - as well as a tug on the heart strings.</p>
      <p>You know Sean Needham’s take on CEO Franklin Hart Jr. is absolutely brilliant because you’re immediately turned off by his sleazy demeanour - but it’s not all gross and gloomy, as there are moments of pure brilliance and side-splitting laughter from this creepy boss.</p>
      <p>While this cast is full of accomplished theatre stars, it’s important to highlight the fresh, emerging talent in the form of Amber Davies, who plays the loveable and innocent Judy Bernley.</p>

      <p>Amber may be known to the public as the winner of 2017’s Love Island, but since making her professional West End debut with this show, it is very clear that she will have a bright and successful career in musical theatre. Her performance of ‘Get Out and Stay Out’ is the show’s belter, and trust me it will stay with you long after the performance has ended.</p>
      <p>Overall, 9 to 5 is the perfect pick me up. In an era where women are being more supportive of each other than ever, this musical packs the right amount of punch of girl power.</p>
      <p>Not only is the story and character development extremely emotive and clever, it’s downright hilarious. You’ll be laughing from start to finish and all the way home.</p>
      <p>
