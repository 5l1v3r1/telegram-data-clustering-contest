      <p>Accra, Nov. 19, GNA - A five-day Scientific Symposium of the West African Postgraduate College of Environmental Health (WAPCEH) is underway in Accra to chart the way forward in addressing the challenges of climate change.</p>
      <p>The symposium brings together environmental health practitioners in the sub-region and is being held on under theme: "Climate Change and one Health Implications for Human, Animal and Environmental Health".</p>
      <p>In a speech read on her behalf, Mrs Cecilia Abena Dappah, the Minister of Sanitation and Water Resources, said the theme was timely because over the years discussions on climate change were focused on human health, neglecting animals which help promote the sustainability of the ecosystem.</p>
      <p>She said Ghana has formulated several policies aimed at promoting ‘One Health’ concerns, including the National Anti-microbial policy, 2018.</p>
      <p>The Minister said the Ministry has initiated projects and programmes aimed at achieving the objectives of ‘one health’.</p>
      <p>"Currently, the Ministry is supporting selected institutions with litter bins to reduce the amount of filth which may end up polluting the environment", she added.</p>
      <p>She said the Ministry was also collaborating with the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development to strengthen the enforcement of sanitary laws to punish recalcitrant individuals whose activities destroy the ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Dr Sunday A.Ojewale, the Secretary General, said WAPCEH had over the years pursued excellence with emphasis on diligence, discipline and determination.</p>
      <p>These values have contributed to the successful accreditation of three Faculties of College in three Nigerian Universities-Health Promotion and Environmental Education, Public Health Entomology and Pest Control and Environmental Epidemiology.</p>
      <p>The conference will discuss topics including Environmental Health and Maternal Child Health Mortality, Environmental Epidemiology and Climate Change and Community Sanitation Technology in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
      <p>The event witnessed the induction of 21 new Fellows from West Africa to the Fellowship out of which seven were Ghanaians.</p>
