      <h1>Fortnite Chapter 2's first season extended until February</h1>
      <h2>As daily challenges return.</h2>

      <p>The first season in Fortnite's Chapter 2 relaunch will now be its longest yet.</p>
      <p>Epic has confirmed an extension for the current season - Chapter 2 Season 1 - until February 2020.</p>
      <p>It means there won't be a big season change before the game's expected Christmas events, although in a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">blog post</a> today Epic promised plenty to keep players busy.</p>
      <p>"Last year we celebrated 14 Days of Fortnite over the holidays," Epic wrote. "This year we've got even more content for you to unwrap, including new game features, free rewards and a live experience that you won't want to miss.</p>
      <p>"To prepare for all the new holiday-themed updates, we will be extending Chapter 2's first season into early February. Get ready for winter!"</p>

      <p>Epic is known for giving Fortnite developers two weeks off both over the Christmas period and during the Summer - during which the game runs its 14 Days events and is largely left to run by itself.</p>
      <p>Whether staff are being given more time off this year, or the launch of Chapter 2 has disrupted Epic's own internal schedule, its clear Season 2 has been pushed back. When Chapter 2 first arrived, its first season was listed to expire in mid-December.</p>
      <p>Chapter 2, which arrived after the game's huge black hole event, acts basically as sequel to what came before - and it will clearly have been a huge effort to get ready in the background. A bit more time off seems well deserved.</p>
      <p>And in other news, today's patch sees the return of Daily Challenges, as well as the MIA Bandage Bazooka healing gun which has been disabled for several weeks.</p>
