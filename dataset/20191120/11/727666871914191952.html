      <p>What would you name some of the rides at a Wu amusement park?</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Wu-Tang Clan has a <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/rza-discusses-wu-tang-clan-of-mics-and-men-documentary-soundtrack-Qj7KYOGsIkCPbKlB3RI83w/">four-part Showtime documentary</a>, a<a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/method-man-discusses-dave-east-playing-him-in-wu-tang-an-american-saga-series-evEFmoK4p0KwV5vxtcJFWw/"> 10-episode scripted Hulu series</a>, and a <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/wu-tang-clan-to-take-part-in-wu-tang-clan-district-day-street-naming-ceremony-oF2QpBrLe0-4lKC0nWFzGA/">Staten Island district named after the faction</a>. So does it really come as a surprise that the iconic Hip Hop brand could be the next Six Flags?</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2019/11/from-his-worcester-storefront-jimmy-kang-is-helping-plan-a-wu-tang-theme-park-in-korea-while-working-as-vp-of-wu-tang-management.html"><i>MassLive</i></a>, Jimmy S. Kang, Vice President of Wu-Tang Clan Management is negotiating the creation of a Wu-Tang theme park in Seoul. His family is originally from Korea, and they immigrated to the United States when he was 4 years old.</p>
      <p>Kang also supervises Wu-Tang Radio, Wu-Tang DJ Coalition, and Protect Ya Neck records/distribution. The former Worcester State University student first met with representatives of the Wu in 2010. </p>
      <p>“They came and asked me to come up to New York City,” recalled Kang about his introduction to the NYC-bred rap collective. “I met up with RZA, Freedom, Devine, Mook, and Krumbsnatcha. When they approached me, I thought it was unreal.”</p>
      <p>Wu-Tang Clan is widely considered one of the greatest Hip Hop acts of all time. RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, Masta Killa, and Cappadonna have released classic albums as both a group and as solo artists.</p>
