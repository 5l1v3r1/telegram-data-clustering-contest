      <h1>JAY-Z's Roc Nation Gets Iconix Brand Group Lawsuit Dismissed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:44:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p>A lawsuit between JAY-Z’s Roc Nation and licensing company Iconix Brand Group has been dismissed.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and-management/8544111/jay-z-roc-nation-iconix-brand-lawsuit-dismissed?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">Billboard,</a> the documents to dismiss the suit were filed in U.S. District Court in New York on November 13.</p>
      <p>The Fashion Law reports the two sides have reached a settlement in which Iconix has agreed to sell a portion of its Rocawear rights back to Roc Nation for a sum of $15 million.</p>
      <p>The original lawsuit was filed in 2017. Iconix Brand Group, which bought the Roc Nation logo from JAY for $204 million, decided to sue the label, New Era, LIDS and the San Francisco Giants for at least $10 million each for using the logo without permission.</p>

      <p>JAY-Z is not having it. After Iconix Brand Group <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.43261/title.jay-z-sued-10m-over-use-of-roc-nation-logo">filed a lawsuit against Hov and Roc Nation</a> for using the company’s logo on Major League Baseball (MLB) merchandise in May, the <i>4:44</i> mastermind is demanding that his name be removed from court docs, according to <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/10/27/jay-z-roc-nation-logo-lawsuit-iconix-brand-group/">TMZ.</a></p>
      <p>Iconix Brand Group bought the Roc Nation logo from JAY for $204 million, but they decided to sue Roc Nation, New Era, LIDS and the San Francisco Giants for at least $10 million each for using the logo without permission.</p>
      <p>JAY is adamant that he shouldn’t be personally involved in the suit. Iconix Brand Group’s issue is with Roc Nation and because there’s no evidence JAY had anything to do with the merchandising deal, he believes he should be excluded from the litigation.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first lawsuit Hov has faced over the years. In 2007, Osama Fahmy, the heir of Egyptian composer Baligh Hamdi, filed a <a href="http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.14996/title.jay-z-timbaland-headed-to-court-for-big-pimpin-copyright-lawsuit">copyright infringement suit</a> against JAY and Timbaland over the 1999 song “Big Pimpin’.”</p>
      <p>Eight years passed before U.S. District Judge Christina Snyder <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/legalentertainment/2017/03/03/jay-z-sued-again-for-big-pimpin-will-egyptian-heir-split-his-bucks/">reportedly</a> stopped the trial in the fall of 2015. The case was officially dismissed in February 2016.</p>
      <p>Hov was also <a href="http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.33478/title.jay-z-wins-lawsuit-against-chauncey-mahan-retains-ownership-of-roc-a-fella-recordings">sued in 2014 by an engineer</a> who worked on <i>Vol 3… The Life and Times of S. Carter </i>(which he eventually won) and filed a lawsuit of his own <a href="http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.38152/title.jay-z-taking-former-tidal-owners-to-court-for-15-million">against the former owners of TIDAL in 2016.</a></p>
