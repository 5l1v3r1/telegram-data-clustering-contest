        <b>Ankhiyon Se Goli Mare from Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar starrer Pati Patni Aur Woh Is out and it’s a sure-shot hit!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Remixing and remaking of old iconic songs has sorts of becoming a trend in Bollywood these days. And the most recent film carry-forward this trend is Pati Patni Aur Woh starring Kartik Aaryan, Ananya Panday and Bhumi Pednekar. After Tony Kakkar’s Dheeme Dheeme, the makers have now remixed Govinda and Raveena Tandon’s iconic ‘Akhiyon Se Goli Mare’ from the 2002 film that goes by the same name. The video of this peppy song is out now and it’s sure to make you shake a leg or two!</p>
      <p>Right from Kartik Aaryan’s sizzling chemistry with both Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday to the colourful set-up and some catchy vocals; Ankhiyon Se Goli Mare has all the ingredients of a chartbuster. What makes this even more special is the fact that is has been choreographed by Farah Khan and the vocals have been sung by Mika Singh. The dance steps, too, are quirky. P.S. They have also recreated Govinda’s steps in this one.</p>
