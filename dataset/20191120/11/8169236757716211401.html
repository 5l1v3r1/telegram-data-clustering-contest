        <b>Tottenham today announced the appointment of Jose Mourinho as their new manager to replace Mauricio Pochettino, and it’s not exactly going brilliantly…</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most Spurs fans are pretty gutted to see Pochettino leave and be replaced by someone who increasingly looks like a has-been at the highest level.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-tottenham-doomed-to-fail/">Jose Mourinho to Tottenham is a move of mutual desperation that is doomed to fail</a></h3>
      <p>And unlike Pochettino, Mourinho is not well known for trusting young players, which could be bad news for some at Spurs.</p>
      <p>See below as Tottenham starlet Troy Parrot hinted he’s not happy about the move, liking a tweet urging him to leave the club for Manchester United after Mourinho’s arrival.</p>

      <p>It’s worth noting the Irish starlet seems to have quickly un-liked this tweet, but it doesn’t look great from a THFC point of view.</p>
      <p>Many of the club’s young players may well fear they will no longer get a route into the first-team or the chance to develop as they did before.</p>
      <p>Parrot looks a huge prospect too, having recently been <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/09/15/spurs-could-lose-another-young-star-as-european-giants-target-talented-striker/">linked with major clubs like Real Madrid and Bayern Munich</a>.</p>
