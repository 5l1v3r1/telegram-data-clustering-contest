      <p>Aussie twins Chris and Cam Grant, founders of travel startup <a href="https://www.unyoked.co/">Unyoked</a>, which offers private cabins in the wilderness with “minimum footprint and maximum chill,” helped design the hut with McConaughey.</p>
      <p>The cabin will be rented out once it is moved to a wilderness area in New South Wales.</p>

      <p>McConaughey said in a statement, according to <i><a href="http://www.justjared.com/2019/11/20/matthew-mcconaughey-celebrates-launch-of-eco-friendly-cabin-in-sydney/">Just Jared:</a></i> “I’ve always been in awe of Australia’s natural beauty.</p>
      <p>“My hope now is that The Reserve by Wild Turkey x Unyoked cabin will inspire Australians to reconnect with nature as an antidote to the frenetic pace of life. I’m also proud that the cabin will form part of the Australian Wild Turkey ‘With Thanks’ initiative that will support people and organizations who demonstrate unwavering conviction to preserving and protecting Australia’s great wilderness and wildlife.”</p>
