      <h1>Labour to Ban Companies from Stock Exchange over Climate Change</h1>
      <h2>The Labour Party’s Marxist Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, has threatened that businesses will be banned from the London Stock Exchange if they fail to act on climate change.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:04:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author">Kurt Zindulka</a></address>
      <p>The Labour Party will make the issue of allegedly man-made climate change — a voter-friendly way of pushing hard-left redistribution politics — its “overriding priority”, according to far-left MP John McDonnell, who laid out a series of radical proposals for the climate and the economy, should Labour take control of Parliament.</p>
      <p>“If we are meet the climate change target to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, we need to ensure that companies are pulling their weight alongside government,” he <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/climate-change-labour-london-stock-exchange-business-manifesto-mcdonnell-a9208801.html">told</a> an event in London on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Vowing to “rewrite the rules” of the economy, McDonnell said that under a Labour government, the Corporate Governance Code would “set out a minimum standard for listing related to evidencing the action being taken to tackle climate change”.</p>
      <p>“For those companies not taking adequate steps under Labour they will be delisted from the London Stock Exchange,” warned McDonnel.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/05/how-john-mcdonnell-leading-surprise-rebirth-british-marxism">Marxist</a> also set his sights on other aspects of the British economy, attacking the wealthy and even going so far as to propose centrally planned wage controls.</p>
      <p>McDonnell, going after billionaires as part of the Labour party’s general push on class warfare, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7701669/John-McDonnell-slams-obscene-billionaires-hard-Left-speech.html">said</a>: “No one needs or deserves to have that much money. It is obscene.”</p>
      <p>To remedy the perceived problem of wealth, he said that the Labour Party “will also move towards a 20:1 pay ratio between lowest and highest-paid employees in companies bidding for public sector contracts”.</p>
      <p>‘A 20:1 ratio means someone earning the living wage, just over £16,000 a year, would permit an executive to be earning nearly £350,000,” he added.</p>
      <p>The proposal to fix wages is reminiscent of the maximum wage, a hallmark of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2019/04/11/raul-castro-warns-cubans-prepare-worst-case-economy/">the economy in communist Cuba</a>, where most professions have salaries capped at <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/cubas-maximum-wage-or-what-life-when-you-follow-gawkers-economic-policy-patrick/">$20 per month</a>.</p>
      <p>The Cuban people do enjoy “free” healthcare and schooling, but as Cuban exile and Yale historian Carlos Eire <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/last-communist-city-13649.html">put it</a>: “All slave owners need to keep their slaves healthy and ensure that they have the skills to perform their tasks.”</p>
