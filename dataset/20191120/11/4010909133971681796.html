      <p><b>MagicBook</b> is the first laptop series that was released by <b>HONOR</b> in 2018. After that, subsequent models were being launched in China without any global launch. Although the laptop series is not among the popular ones, but they are definitely the above-average laptops you can purchase at an affordable price. Recently, a new model from the series is <a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2019/11/19/honor-magicbook-15-goes-up-for-pre-order-on-jdmall-com/">spotted</a> in a listing of devices that appeared on JingDong Mall.</p>
      <p>The new<b> HONOR MagicBook 15 </b>is only going to come with an Intel variant unlike what they did with the previous version which also offered another AMD Ryzen variant. It is also said to be having two storage options which are 256GB and 512GB SSD storage. There will be a fingerprint sensor on the power button as well for security.</p>
      <p>For aesthetic, it seems like the laptop still maintain its MacBook-like design while taking a different direction on the colour scheme. The HONOR MagicBook 15 we can see from the pictures below show that the laptop will come with a silver body that adds a touch of blue to the edges. The colour of the edges also somehow assembles the colour of their logo which will appear on the laptop as well.</p>

      <p>However, if youâ€™re looking for Windows OS-operated laptops, this one might not be the one for you. The new HONOR MagicBook is going to exclusively run Linux as the main operating system. There is no pricing information for the HONOR MagicBook 15 yet. Hopefully, the laptop is going to stay in the mid-range pricing range that continues to offer high standard user experience.</p>
