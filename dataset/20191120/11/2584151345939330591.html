      <h2>Germany and the Netherlands should boost budgets to spur economic growth, Commission says.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:07:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author">Bjarke Smith-Meyer</a></address>
      <p>The European Commission urged Germany and the Netherlands Wednesday to spend even more money than they've promised to help reverse an economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IP-Autumn-Fiscal-Package-EN2.pdf">made the call</a> in Brussels after publishing the EU executive body's Autumn Fiscal Package, which <a href="https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Communication-on-2020-Draft-Budgetary-Plans.pdf">signed off governments’ budget plans</a> for 2020.</p>
      <p>The call for more spending comes despite Berlin’s decision in September to launch a multibillion-euro climate plan to help reach its emissions-reduction goal by 2030. The Hague also pledged tax cuts and extra investment next year.</p>
      <p>But more is needed, the commission said, as <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/dombrovskis-says-spend-now-to-rescue-economic-growth/">eurozone economic growth is set to slow</a> to 1.1 percent this year and 1.2 percent for 2020 and the year after.</p>
      <p>“With mounting risks weighing on Europe's economic growth prospects, it is reassuring to see euro area countries like Germany and the Netherlands using fiscal space to support investment,” Dombrovskis said in a statement. “However, there is scope for them to do more.”</p>
      <p>The Latvian’s call for more investment signals a further shift of focus from indebted countries onto governments with extra spending capacity, which can be deployed to help stimulate the economy.</p>
      <p>The European Central Bank has made similar calls, as the impact of its interest-rate cuts are beginning to wane.</p>
      <p>The Commission still called on Belgium, France, Italy and Spain to reduce their high debt piles, warning of “non-compliance with the debt reduction benchmark.”</p>
      <p>“It should be their priority,” Dombrovskis said.</p>
