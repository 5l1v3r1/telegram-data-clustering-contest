      <p>It’s become a signature holiday-season event in the South Okanagan —The ninth annual Light Up the Vines along the Bottleneck Drive is coming up, paired with Summerland’s 32nd annual Light Up.</p>
      <p>It’s a good idea to have a plan because the crowds gather for oohs and aahs.</p>
      <p>Tip number one: take advantage of the “sneak-a-peek” option this Saturday, Nov. 23, as the wineries, cideries, breweries, and distilleries along Bottleneck Drive give their decorated vineyards, orchards and tasting rooms a test run.</p>
      <p>This sneak preview on Saturday runs from 3-8 p.m. Then, get ready for the main event.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Nov. 30 and Sunday, Dec. 1, 18, wineries, three cideries, one brewery, and one distillery will open their doors and turn on the holiday lights. That’s a lot of potential stops, so hire a tour company if you haven’t selected a designated driver.</p>
      <p>Visitors can ‘Sip ‘n Shop’ their way along Bottleneck Drive and enjoy tastings, live music, holiday lights and special discounts. Some tasting rooms will offer special treats such as warm spiced cider or mulled wine, bonfires, complimentary snacks such as crepes or bratwurst and DIY s’mores to name a few.</p>
      <p>Visitors also have a chance to win a prize package valued at over $500 by collecting five stamps with a Light up the Vines passport.</p>
      <p>Bonus, during Light Up Summerland, head to the downtown area at 5 p.m. for a beverage while exploring live music, local bites, street vendors, and fireworks.</p>
      <p>Tip number two? Study the Bottleneck Drive map, found at <a href="https://bottleneckdrive.com/tours/">https://bottleneckdrive.com/tours/</a>, and the Light Up event map at <a href="http://summerlandlightup.com/the-32nd-festival/maps/">http://summerlandlightup.com/the-32nd-festival/maps/</a>.</p>
      <p>More than 10,000 people will make their way to the Light Up festival. A bit of planning well help ensure you get to your favourite parts.</p>
