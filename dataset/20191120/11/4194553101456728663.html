      <h1>(Video) LFC’s stunning rondo under new coach Vitor Matos</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:38:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>There were plenty of youngsters on display at training today – with the majority of the first-team still absent due to their international break commitments.</p>
      <p>The likes of Yasser Larouci, Elijah Dixon-Bonner, Neco Williams and Curtis Jones all featured heavily under Jurgen Klopp, Pep Lijnders and newly appointed coach Vitor Matos.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You can watch the whole training session from ‘Inside Anfield’ by signing up to <a href="https://video.liverpoolfc.com/">LFCTVGO</a>, here.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We were most impressed by this rondo drill, under the close watch of Matos, which displayed the immense close-control of the various Academy lads who got the Melwood call-up.</p>
      <p>If you cut to <a href="https://streamable.com/okh5r">two minutes into the clip</a>, courtesy of LFCTV, you’ll see what we’re talking about!</p>
      <p>The rest of the first-team should be returning tomorrow to being preparations for Crystal Palace on Sunday.</p>
