      <p>BERLIN — The son of former German President, Richard von Weizsäcker, was stabbed to death while he was giving a lecture at a Berlin medical clinic late Tuesday night, German police said.</p>
      <p>Fritz von Weizsäcker, a prominent German physician, was giving a lecture on fatty liver diseases at the Schlosspark Clinic. Around an hour into the talks, a man in the audience reportedly approached von Weizsäcker and stabbed him several times with a knife.</p>
      <p>He died at the scene despite immediate medical attention from colleagues, according to <a href="https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article203663500/Fritz-von-Weizsaecker-erstochen-Was-wir-ueber-den-Verdaechtigen-wissen.html">German media</a>. Another man from the audience — who reportedly tried to stop the attack — was seriously wounded.</p>
      <p>German police arrested a 57-year old man at the scene. "We cannot yet say anything about the attacker’s motive," said police spokesman Michael Gassen, adding that the suspect was still being questioned.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said, "It is a terrible blow for the von Weizsäcker family and the sympathy of the chancellor, certainly also of the members of the federal government as a whole, goes to the widow, to the whole family."</p>
      <p>The leader of Germany's liberal Free Democrats, Christian Lindner, <a href="https://twitter.com/c_lindner/status/1196909157611442176">wrote on Twitter</a> he was "shocked" by the attack and that he had lost his "friend" who had been a "passionate physician and a fine human being."</p>
      <p>"Once again, one wonders what world we live in," Lindner wrote.</p>
      <p>Von Weizsäcker's father was president from 1984 to 1994 and also served as Governing Mayor of Berlin.</p>
