      <h1>'Low-lifes' steal safe and 40 bottles of spirits from Hucknall Town FC</h1>
      <h2>'Any money is a loss to a club at our level,' said the club chairman</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:47:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>Thieves raided and smashed through the clubhouse of non-league Hucknall Town - causing thousands of pounds worth of damage.</p>
      <p>Chairman Bob Scotney said the culprits removed a panel below a window at ground level to get in and broke several locks in a raid believed to have happened between 9pm on Monday, November 18, and 8.20am on Tuesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>A safe from the cellar was taken, along with about 40 full bottles of spirits. Boxes of sweets, including bags of Haribo, were also stolen.</p>
      <p>Mr Scotney, 60, said the 'old-fashioned' safe was taken using a trolley used by staff to move around barrels of beer.</p>
      <p>"There was cash in the safe," he said. "Any money is a loss to a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/">club</a> at our level. It's got to be replaced."</p>
      <p>Storage containers full of alcohol were also taken from the cellar and behind the bar at the ground in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">Watnall Road</a>.</p>
      <p>"We probably estimate in the region of 40 [bottles]," said Mr Scotney, who has been the club chairman for about four years. "All your regular brands - your vodka, your Southern Comfort, Jack Daniels, gin.</p>
      <p>"It's all branded, we don't sell any non-branded types of spirit."</p>
      <p>The thieves only took full bottles.</p>
      <p>The club is run by volunteers and Mr Scotney said it came as a disappointment to find "some low-lifes have caused that much damage".</p>
      <p>Several doors were smashed and have had to be repaired.</p>
      <p>"It will run into thousands of pounds for the damage and everything we have got to put right, even small things like padlocks."</p>

      <p>Tills were also damaged but Mr Scotney said there was no money in them.</p>
      <p>The club posted pictures of the damage on Facebook, with images showing smashed glass on the floor.</p>
      <p>A club statement, published on Tuesday (November 19), read: "This is what we have walked into after a break in at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/">club</a> last night.</p>
      <p>"A safe was stolen and taken in a sack trolley along with equipment and spirits.</p>
      <p>"Did anyone see anything suspicious between 9pm last night and 8am?</p>
      <p>"If so please contact the club or the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">police</a>."</p>
      <p>All the damage has been repaired.</p>
      <p>Police have launched an appeal for witnesses.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Mark Westlake, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: â€œOur investigation into this burglary is ongoing, including checking for any CCTV opportunities and carrying out house-to-house enquiries."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information which may help the investigation is asked to contact the force on 101, quoting incident 132 of November 19.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
