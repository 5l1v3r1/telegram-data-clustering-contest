      <h3>AN active member of Philippine Army was shot dead by one of the group of his fellow soldiers following their heated altercation while inside a restaurant bar yesterday before dawn in Taguig City.</h3>
      <p>PFC Gerald Niko Del Pilar, presently assigned at the Military Police Battalion, Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Support Group (MPBn-HHSG) in Fort Bonifacio died on the spot from single bullet wound in the head.</p>
      <p>Taguig police chief P/Col. Alexander Santos said two of the five suspects identified as Sgt. John Necesito, presently assigned at the Light Reaction Regiment (LRR) Philippine Army and Jepoy Arcilla, a striker at LRR were arrested by responding policemen while three others believed to be soldiers managed to escape on board a stainless owner type jeep bringing with them the weapon used.</p>
      <p>The heated altercation between PFC Del Pilar and the group of suspects started at around 2:35 a.m. when the victim, who was drinking alone inside EJC Restobar located along Bayani Road, was hit by a beer bottle cap coming from the adjacent table occupied by the group of suspects.</p>
      <p>The victim, who was already drunk, got irked and confronted the group of suspects that resulted in their heated altercation.</p>
      <p>Security guards and the towner of the restaurant bar managed to pacify the victim and the group of suspects but their quarrel continued as soon as they went out of the establishment until one of the suspects pumped a single bullet in the head of PFC Del Pilar, killing him instantly.</p>
