      <h1>PAL, PNB evacuated due to bomb threat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:32:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/itchie-g-cabayan" target="_blank">Itchie G. Cabayan</a></address>
      <h3>OFFICIALS and employees of the Philippine Airlines (PAL) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) were evacuated the other day due to a ‘bomb threat.’</h3>
      <p>In her social media post, PAL spokesperson Ma. Cielo Villaluna said that employees and officials evacuated their office  building Tuesday afternoon after a personnel received a bomb scare sent by an unidentified suspect.</p>
      <p>Villaluna said that  at 2:10 p.m. of  November 19, an unknown number sent a text message to a PNB security personnel, saying that ‘a bomb will explode anytime within the PNB compound.’ PAL holds office in the same compound, which is located on Macapagal Avenue in Pasay City.</p>
      <p>As all PAL and PNB-based employees and officials evacuated the PNB financial center building, Villaluna said bomb experts from the Philippine National Police were called to conduct a bomb sweep.</p>
      <p>After a check was made in the area  from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., the whole compound was declared safe and free of any bomb or any other explosive device.  </p>
      <p>‘Did you know that carrying out a bomb hoax is a criminal offense and punishable by law? For those who have nothing better to do, and are behind this, may the law catch up with you!,’ Villaluna thus ranted in her post.</p>
