      <h1>A$AP Rocky Plans To Design Uniforms For The Inmates In The Swedish Prison</h1>

      <p>Not too long ago, it was reported that A$AP Rocky had some pretty severe issues in Sweden where he was locked up. Thatâ€™s the reason for which people were shocked to learn that he plans to <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/aap-rocky-will-return-to-sweden-for-a-performance-following-his-assault-conviction-339208/">go back for a performance</a> before the end of this year, according to info coming from The Shade Room.</p>
      <p>Now, TSR revealed that heâ€™s shocking people once again and â€˜reportedly designing prison uniforms for the inmates in the Swedish jail where he was held for six months.â€™</p>
      <p>TSR cites the info from Forbes and says that â€˜Rocky is trying to put his best foot forward and give back to Sweden after his arrest. In his first public speaking event since being arrested, Rocky attended a live conference called #Summit, where he reportedly explained his upcoming fashion plans.â€™</p>

      <p>People donâ€™t seem quite impressed in the comments, as you will see for yourselves.</p>
      <p>Someone said: â€˜This is how you switch it around and make a ðŸ’°. The true definition of PAYBACK,â€™ while another follower said: â€˜I canâ€™t believe that was 6 months lmaooo thought it was a week.â€™</p>
      <p>A commenter posted: â€˜These celebs spend one night in jail .. now they got bright ideas for new colored uniforms! Yay !! ðŸ™„â€™</p>
      <p>Someone else is also unimpressed: â€˜Why?? To make it cool to be in jail???? This world is lost.â€™</p>
      <p>A follower said this: â€˜Donate money to educational programs, empowerment workshops or activities you felt were lacking within their prison systemâ€¦an outfit is one of the least significant things you can give someone to help them leave this experience better than they came. #Priorities.â€™</p>
      <p>What do you think about A$APâ€™s latest decision?</p>
