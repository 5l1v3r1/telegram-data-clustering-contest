      <h1>Stablecoin businesses ARE money transmitters, says FinCEN chief</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:29:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>Stablecoins fall under the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) remit to safeguard money transmission services, which means issuers must register as such and comply with anti-money laundering rules.</p>
      <p>That’s according to director Kenneth Blanco, who <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/news/speeches/prepared-remarks-fincen-director-kenneth-blanco-chainalysis-blockchain-symposium">made the comments</a> while speaking at a conference in New York last week.</p>
      <p>“Because we are technology-neutral, we can say with complete clarity that for AML/CFT purposes, it should be understood that transactions in stablecoins, like any other value that substitutes for currency, are covered by our definition of ‘money transmission services’,” Blanco said.</p>
      <p>“This means that accepting and transmitting activity denominated in stablecoins makes you a money transmitter under the BSA [Bank Secrecy Act]. It does not matter if the stablecoin is backed by a currency, a commodity, or even an algorithm — the rules are the same. To that point, administrators of stablecoins have to register as MSBs [money services business] with FinCEN,” he added.</p>
      <p>FinCEN works to protect the US financial system from illicit use, fighting money laundering, and promoting security.</p>
      <p>“ […] We remain committed to building our capabilities and understanding of convertible virtual currencies and look forward to continuing our efforts to keep our country safe and secure with you,” Blanco concluded.</p>
      <p>The comments come after FinCEN <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/application-fincens-regulations-certain-business-models">issued guidance</a> for companies working with convertible virtual currencies in May.</p>
      <p>At the same time, it also issued <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/advisories/fincen-advisory-fin-2019-a003">an advisory</a> on illicit activity involving convertible virtual currency, in a bid to help financial institutions monitor and report suspicious activity.</p>
      <p>In March last year, FinCEN <a href="https://coincenter.org/files/2018-03/fincen-ico-letter-march-2018-coin-center.pdf">published a letter</a> that suggested it would apply its regulations to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).</p>
      <p>The letter, which was sent to US Senator Ron Wyden, noted that parties involved in the sale of ICO-derived tokens would need to register as money transmitters and comply with the relevant rules around anti-money laundering.</p>
