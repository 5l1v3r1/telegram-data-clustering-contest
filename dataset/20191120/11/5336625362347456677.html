      <p>Billie Eilish is a superfan of <i>The Office</i>. So much so that when she met Rainn Wilson, AKA Dwight Schrute, she absolutely wowed him with her next-level knowledge of the iconic show. But how does Wilson's knowledge of the "Bad Guy" singer compare? </p>
      <p>In fact, she was even a little bit nervous about meeting Wilson. We would be too, to be fair. </p>
      <p>Wilson said that at the time he interviewed Eilish, she'd watched the show from start to finish 12 times. "I asked them to get the hardest<i> Office </i>trivia possible known to man and she nailed it," said Wilson.</p>
      <p>Lilly Singh quizzed Wilson on his knowledge of Eilish and, you know what, he got every single question right. He correctly guessed that she was born on the same year as the iPod came out. He knew which of her songs shares a name with a TV show of his. He even knew about her former crush on Justin Bieber. </p>
      <p>Impressive stuff.</p>
