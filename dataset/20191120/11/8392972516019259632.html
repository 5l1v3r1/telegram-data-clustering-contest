      <h2>It was a very strange Bushtucker Trial moment</h2>

      <p>Andrew Maxwell caused a stir on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> by making what viewers interpreted as poo-straining noises during his first Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>On last night's (19.11.19) episode, Andrew took on a challenge called Face Your Fears alongside campmates Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright, James Haskell and Jacqueline Jossa.</p>

      <p>The task involved the celebs donning a glass bowl helmet and attempting to procure stars for the camp as their headgear was filled with nasties.</p>
      <p>Andrew's turn was one of the more gruesome of the lot, as his helmet was filled with a mass of cockroaches.</p>

      <p>The beasties swarmed all over his face but Andrew kept his eyes and mouth firmly shut as he struggled to unlock two stars bolted down in a box in front of him.</p>
      <p>It was a good attempt, but everyone was more interested in the bizarre grunting noises he was making as he contended with the cockroaches.</p>

      <p>Viewers rushed to Twitter to poke fun at the Irish funnyman, with many admitting he sounded like he was taking a massive poo.</p>
      <p>One said: "Andrew sounds like he's having the world's largest [bleep] #ImACeleb #imacelebrity."</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Andrew sounds like he's straining for a [bleep] on this trial #ImACeleb #imacelebrity."</p>
      <aside>Sounds like my brother on the bog every morning.</aside>
      <p>A third joked, with a string of crying-laughing emojis: "Andrew's noises coming out of that helmet sounds like my brother on the bog every morning."</p>
      <p>Someone else compared him to Star Wars' famous villain: "What is that noise Andrew is making? Sounds like Darth Vader having a [bleep] #ImACeleb."</p>
      <p>A fifth demanded: "I'm sorry but what the [bleep] was that noise Andrew was making during the trail?"</p>

      <p>Despite Andrew's shocking noises, former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress Jacqueline Jossa was arguably the stand-out star of last night's Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>The actress appeared to be absolutely terrified at the prospect of putting on the glass bowl and having creatures crawling all over her face - and was even in tears watching Andrew's noisy struggle.</p>
      <p>But she ended up <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jacqueline-jossas-tears-despite-nailing-bushtucker-trial/">overcoming her fears completely to smash the trial</a> and nab two stars for the camp.</p>
