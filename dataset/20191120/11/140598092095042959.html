      <p>Profiteroles are a childhood favourite, and the trick is to make sure they’re not too soggy. You don’t want them crispy (it’s not toast) and there should be a slight softness, but you need some texture, especially if you’re pairing them with hot chocolate sauce and ice cream.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>20 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 30 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six to eight </p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the profiteroles:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>65g strong plain flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>150ml water</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Vanilla ice cream, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the chocolate sauce:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>250ml milk</li>
        <li>25g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>40g caster sugar</li>
        <li>35ml double cream</li>
        <li>185g 70 per cent chocolate, chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>To make the profiteroles, preheat the oven to 220C/200C fan/Gas 7.</li>
        <li>Sift the flour, caster sugar and salt carefully on to a large sheet of parchment paper – this will allow you to roll up the paper and shoot the flour quickly into the butter mixture when it’s ready.</li>
        <li>Put the butter and water in a saucepan and heat until the butter melts, continuing until it starts to boil – when it does, remove from the heat and use the paper like a slide to add the flour to the pan.</li>
        <li> Beat immediately and return to a gentle heat to cook out the mixture (the roux) until it comes away from the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>At this point remove from the heat and add the eggs a little at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Place teaspoonfuls of the mixture on to the lined tray, leaving a good 2cm gap between each dollop.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven until they start to rise – about 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, pierce the undersides so they don’t collapse and place back in the oven for another three to four minutes to crisp up.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and allow to cool.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat the milk with the cocoa powder, sugar and cream until the sugar dissolves. Bring to the boil and pour this over the chocolate in a large bowl. Mix well to melt the chocolate, then pour through a sieve to strain. Leave to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>To serve, slice each profiterole in half and fill with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Pour over the chocolate sauce.</li>
      </ol>
