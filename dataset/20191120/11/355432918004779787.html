      <p>House investigators kicked off the second week of public hearings in the ongoing impeachment inquiry on Tuesday, headlined by testimony from Army Lt. Col. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a></b>, who has become a key witness regarding <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>’s</b> dealings with Ukraine. </p>
      <p>Vindman, who serves as the director for European Affairs for the National Security Council (NSC), and <b>Jennifer Williams</b>, a top aide to <b>Vice President Pence</b>, became the first White House officials to testify publicly. During their testimony, the pair of officials criticized the president for his request that Ukrainian President <b>Volodymyr Zelensky</b> open investigations into former Vice President <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a></b> and his son <b>Hunter Biden</b>. </p>
      <p>Unlike the three officials who testified last week, both Vindman and Williams had first-hand accounts of the July 25 call, which Trump has repeatedly said was “perfect” since releasing the transcript. Vindman said it is “improper” for the president to call on a foreign government to investigate a political opponent, and Williams labeled the phone call “unusual” (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471060-vindman-defends-impeachment-witnesses-describes-concerns-about-trump">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p>Throughout the hearing, Republicans on the panel and Trump allies tried to call into question Vindman’s character and allegiance to the United States. At one point, GOP counsel <b>Steve Castor</b> asked Vindman about suggestions that he could serve as Ukraine’s defense minister, which a top Ukrainian official jokingly floated. Vindman retorted that he “immediately dismissed those offers,” adding that he is an American.</p>
      <p>Rep. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/chris-stewart">Chris Stewart</a> </b>(R-Utah) also noted that Vindman was in uniform for the hearing — which <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471113-trump-on-vindman-i-understand-now-he-wears-his-uniform-when-he-goes">Trump commented on</a> during the hearing — before asking moments later if he always insists on “civilians calling you by your rank.” The question was referring to Vindman asking Rep. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a></b> (R-Calif.), the panel’s ranking member, to refer to him by his official title rather than “Mr. Vindman.”</p>

      <p>In the afternoon portion, <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/kurt-volker">Kurt Volker</a></b>, the former special envoy to Ukraine, made headlines when he admitted he has “learned many things” from other witnesses who talked to investigators behind closed doors throughout the impeachment process. Since becoming the first to testify to lawmakers in private as part of the inquiry, Volker has seen witness after witness add details. He initially told lawmakers he saw no indication that Trump had set up an arrangement to withhold military aid for Ukraine in exchange for investigations into his political rivals (<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/19/kurt-volker-public-impeachment-hearing-071566">Politico</a>). </p>
      <p><i>"I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question,"</i> Volker said, adding that his initial testimony was not untruthful, even if revised. </p>
      <p>Volker, one of the witnesses requested by GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee, also said that he "should have seen" a connection between Ukraine investigating energy company Burisma and talk of investigating the Bidens. </p>
      <p><i>"Had I done so, I would have raised my own objections,”</i> said Volker, who was testifying alongside<b> Tim Morrison,</b> an outgoing member of the NSC. </p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/470965-watch-live-house-holds-third-day-of-public-impeachment-hearings">The Hill</a>: Volker says he was never involved in “bribery” or “extortion.”</p>

      <p>Looking ahead to today, the Intelligence Committee will hear from Ambassador to the European Union <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a></b>, who is likely to be the star witness of the week. The hearing will come a week after the biggest revelation of the public hearings thus far: that an official overheard a call between Sondland and Trump in which the president asked about “investigations.” Instead, Sondland told <b>David Holmes</b>, an official who worked for <b>William Taylor</b>, the top diplomat in Ukraine, that Trump cared more about investigating the Bidens than about Ukraine. </p>
      <p><i>“I’ve never seen anything like this,” </i>Holmes told House investigators in closed-door testimony last week.</p>
      <p>Sondland’s testimony is scheduled to start at 9 a.m. In the afternoon, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense <b>Laura Cooper</b> and Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs <b>David Hale</b> will appear before the panel.</p>

        <u>LEADING THE DAY</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>POLITICS &amp; CAMPAIGNS: </b>
        <i>*** <b>Joe Biden</b> celebrates his 77th birthday today! ***</i>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>While impeachment takes center stage during the day, eyeballs will shift at night as the 2020 Democratic field takes to the debate stage in Atlanta and focus continues to center on the top four candidates, along with those who have either just jumped into the race or are looking to do so in the near future.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471218-five-things-to-watch-in-tonights-dem-debate">As Max Greenwood writes in his debate preview</a>, much of the attention will be on Sen. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> </b>(D-Mass.), who has seen her support levels plateau in recent weeks amid criticism of her “Medicare for All” proposal and backlash from the centrist wing of the party. Whether Warren can parry attacks and effectively ease concerns about her candidacy and viability in a general election setting remain key questions she’ll likely try to answer tonight.</p>
      <p>With Warren slipping, the centrists in the field are sensing opportunity, regardless of whether they’ll be on the debate stage tonight. Former Massachusetts Gov. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/deval-patrick">Deval Patrick</a>’s</b> recent (and late) entrance in the race is a prime example, with former New York City Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a></b> potentially waiting in the wings as well. </p>
      <p>Finally, it also remains to be seen what treatment South Bend, Ind., Mayor <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a></b> receives tonight as he continues to rise in early voting states, including New Hampshire, according to a new poll released today.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471199-buttigieg-positioned-to-push-biden-aside">As Amie Parnes writes</a>, Buttigieg is in a position to surpass Biden if his momentum holds, Democratic observers say. The polling surge, especially in Iowa, has created a new round of buzz around his candidacy, and while he's still struggling to build a coalition and draw support from black and Hispanic voters, Democrats say he could lure not only would-be Biden supporters but also undecided voters. </p>
      <p><i>"It's true that right now Buttigieg has a lot of work to do to gain non white support but you don't need much of a rainbow coalition to win Iowa and New Hampshire, and the momentum he'll gain from that one-two punch, if he does win both, is substantial and maybe insurmountable,"</i> said Democratic strategist <b>Christy Setzer</b>.</p>

        <u>IN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES</u>
      </p>
      <p><b>MORE CONGRESS: </b>The Senate unanimously passed a bill on Tuesday aimed at supporting protesters in Hong Kong and warning China against a violent suppression of the demonstrations, in contrast with Trump’s near-silence about the clashes. The vote marks a challenge to China and would require annual reviews of Hong Kong’s special status under U.S. law to assess the extent to which China has chipped away at the city’s autonomy (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/u-s-senate-unanimously-passes-bill-backing-hong-kong-protesters?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">Bloomberg News</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Averting a shutdown</b>: The House passed a month long continuing resolution on Tuesday, postponing another shutdown showdown until Dec. 20, even as progress over spending negotiations has stalled. The news ensures that lawmakers will be working toward a resolution before the expected Christmas break (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/471135-house-passes-spending-stopgap-measure-ahead-of-shutdown-deadline">The Hill)</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Slow motion: </b>Senators are fuming as major legislation has ground to a halt, fueling complaints by lawmakers about who is to blame. Republicans argue Democrats are too focused on impeachment and have coined a term, “Schumer’s graveyard,” pointing the finger at Senate Minority Leader <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/charles-schumer">Charles Schumer</a></b> (D-N.Y.). However, 70 of the 100 most recent votes in the Senate were tied to nominations, a stated priority of Majority Leader <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell">Mitch McConnell</a></b> (R-Ky.) (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/471192-2020-republicans-accuse-schumer-of-snubbing-legislation">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p>  </p>
      <p><b>Vaping legislation</b> is a new priority for some House Democrats who want to ban flavored e-cigarette products that appeal to young people. Lawmakers are responding to news reports this week that Trump, pressured by the vaping industry and worried about conservative opposition to tougher regulation, backed off a Food and Drug Administration proposed ban on flavored vaping products. Anti-vaping advocates are turning to Congress to act this year, responding to rising statistics about lung illnesses and deaths tied to e-cigarettes. As a legislative fallback, they point to a measure sponsored by McConnell in the Senate that would raise the tobacco purchasing age to 21 (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471209-congress-feels-heat-to-act-on-youth-vaping">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p><b>Opportunity zones </b>for distressed communities, a provision included in the GOP tax law enacted in 2017, are <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/congress/article237472594.html">undergoing new scrutiny</a> among some lawmakers (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/finance/471208-trump-tax-breaks-for-low-income-neighborhoods-draw-scrutiny">The Hill</a>). … The HUBZone federal program funneled millions of dollars into Washington, D.C.’s richest rather than poorest areas because the Small Business Administration program relied on 1999 data that is now inaccurate, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/outdated-poverty-data-funneled-millions-to-wealthy-dc-neighborhoods-post-analysis-shows/2019/11/19/3eadb000-b25c-11e9-951e-de024209545d_story.html">an analysis by The Washington Post</a>. </p>
      <p><b>On track for chairwoman</b>: Rep. <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/carolyn-maloney">Carolyn Maloney</a></b> (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday won the support of colleagues on the House Steering Committee to become the first woman to chair the House Oversight and Reform Committee following the death of former Chairman <b><a href="https://thehill.com/people/elijah-cummings-0">Elijah Cummings</a></b> (D-Md.) on Oct. 17. The House Democratic Caucus could make Maloney’s role official with a vote today (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471153-maloney-wins-vote-for-oversight-chair">The Hill</a>).</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>WHITE HOUSE &amp; ADMINISTRATION: </b><b>U.S.-China trade</b>: Trump on Tuesday threatened to again raise U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports if negotiators are unable to come to an agreement on a trade deal. </p>
      <p>The president last month announced a "phase one" preliminary agreement in concept with China, but an accord remains up in the air (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471108-trump-threatens-to-raise-tariffs-on-china-if-no-trade-deal">The Hill</a>).</p>

      <p><b>&gt; U.S. and Iran</b>: The Pentagon predicts that Iran will seek to purchase new fighter jets and tanks from Russia and China when an international arms embargo expires in October 2020. Tehran is expected to “go after fighters” because its “current air force is dated,” a senior defense official said on Tuesday. Tehran will also seek to buy battle tanks, officials added (<a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/471171-pentagon-warns-iran-will-seek-advanced-weapons-as-embargo-expires">The Hill</a>).</p>
      <p><b>&gt; Fitness and health</b>: Trump, without prompting from reporters on Tuesday, brought up the subject of his health after he made an unscheduled visit on Saturday afternoon to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to undergo unspecified medical tests and lab work. The president assailed the news media for its attention to the matter. A statement released on Monday<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471030-trumps-doctor-issues-letter-addressing-speculation-about-visit-to"> by a White House physician</a> described tests the president did not undergo (no “specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations”) rather than account for “routine” examinations Trump received (<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471106-trump-rips-speculation-over-his-health">The Hill</a>).  </p>

      <p>The late Sen. <b>Richard Lugar</b> (R-Ind.), who died in April, will also be honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award today, to be accepted by his son <b>John Lugar</b>, the executive director of the nonprofit Lugar Center in Washington.
