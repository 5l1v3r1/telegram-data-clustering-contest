      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:54:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Meghna-Majumdar-9118/" target="_blank">Meghna Majumdar</a></address>
      <p>It is a testament to the allure of real-life stories, that the narrow halls of Madras Literary Society library were teeming with people on Saturday morning, for the launch of a non-fiction book. People had lined up against the walls; some spilled out into the corridor. At the centre of the polite hubbub were author Aparna Karthikeyan and two distinguished guests. Beside them, in their share of the spotlight, were bull rearers, artisans, weavers, farmers, <i>nadaswaram</i> makers, toddy tappers and dancers — protagonists of the book, who had travelled from different parts of Tamil Nadu to attend the launch.</p>
      <p><i>Nine Rupees an Hour: Disappearing Livelihoods of Tamil Nadu</i> (Westland) brings together years of Aparna’s work as a journalist. Launched by veteran journalist P Sainath and received by The Hindu Group of Publications’ director Nirmala Lakshman, the book focusses on the livelihoods of the hinterland that are part of the State’s culture and rural economy. Livelihoods that have been left behind through the years of India’s development.</p>

      <p>Among those in attendance were Zeenath from Pathamadai village, who not only makes silk mats on a floor loom but also provides livelihood to other women through it; Anthony Rayappan from Ramanathapuram, who scales enough palm trees per week to equal the height of Mount Everest; and P Chandrasekharan, who makes sickles that are unique to his village Thiruppachetti. The author introduced each of the protagonists — some of whom had travelled to Chennai with their children and spouses — to the audience, and gave them a gist of their work. The attendees listened in rapt attention, for the tales were just that interesting, be it that of the only woman to own and rear stud bulls, or one of the few male dancers to be skilled in both Bharatanatyam and folk dance. Needless to say, many of their journeys are also tales of either social or economic challenges. Sometimes both. As Sainath observed, “What an astonishing collection of talent, skill and centuries of knowledge under one roof. Cherish this moment, it doesn’t come often.”</p>
      <p>Sainath, whose platform People’s Archive of Rural India (PARI) had hosted some of these stories earlier, said he felt “proud and privileged to see many of these faces here. I had only seen them in videos Aparna had made for PARI.”</p>
      <p>He commended Aparna for telling people’s stories through their own voices, not her own. He observed how she kept their experience at the forefront, while backing the tales up with contextual essays, including quotes from officials.</p>
