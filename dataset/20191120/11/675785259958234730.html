      <h2>Prince Andrew's interview with Newnight's Emily Maitlis has been labelled a "car crash" and a "disaster", but he apparently wants to "put right the things he didn’t say"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:19:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:19</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew is considering doing another interview about his friendship with paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, royal sources have claimed.</p>
      <p>The Queen's son sat down with Newnight's Emily Maitlis to face a number of difficult questions on the subject in what many have described as a "car crash" inteview.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Andrew, 59, has faced questions about his friendship with Epstein and claims he had sex with a 17-year-old girl - which he denies.</p>
      <p>According to insiders the prince hoped to draw a line under the issue, but many viewers believe it left more questions than it gave answers.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_brand=vanity-fair&amp;utm_social-type=earned">Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl</a> , he now wants to do a second chat to "put right the things he didn't say".</p>

      <p>A source said: "There are rumors swirling that Andrew wants to do another interview.</p>
      <p>"Andrew hasn’t drawn a line under it. He wants the chance to put right the things he didn’t say.</p>
      <p>"Newsnight gave him the chance to show some remorse. He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say. It was an open goal - he didn’t grasp it, and I think he sees that now."</p>
      <p>However Buckingham Palace is "not aware" that anything is in the pipeline at this point.</p>

      <p>Andrew reportedly told the Queen the interview was "a great success".</p>
      <p>A friend of the duke told the  <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10365159/prince-andrew-queen-church-success/">Sun:</a>  "The duke went to church with the Queen (on Sunday) and was heard telling her it’s all been a great success.</p>
      <p>“He thinks he’s done the right thing and has put the criticism to rest. He was all smiles and was looking very buoyant and happy.”</p>
      <p>Andrew told aides he was “happy” with his performance despite being grilled by Maitlis on his relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in jail earlier this year while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Behind the scenes palace sources have described the duke's performance as “utterly jaw dropping” with one insider suggesting aides were left “dumbfounded” after watching the Newsnight interview on Saturday evening.</p>
