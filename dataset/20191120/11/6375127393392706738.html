      <h1>Duterte to welcome US rights advocate with a ‘slap on face’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:40:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/efren-montano" target="_blank">Efren Montano</a></address>
      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday lashed out at a foreign human rights advocate who offered to help Vice President and anti-drug czar Leni Robredo  end a “murderous drug war.”</h3>
      <p>The President was furious over the tweet of Phelim Kine, former Human Rights Watch Asia head, who said that Duterte and his “henchmen” should be arrested for inciting mass murder in the guise of anti-drug operations.</p>
      <p>Duterte said that since Robredo is meeting with foreign agencies to solve the drug woes, she should also bring in Kine, whom he mistakenly referred to as a prosecutor, to prove her dedication to her job as the co-chair of the Inter-agency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD).</p>
      <p>The President also said Kine will be welcomed with a slap on the face if he comes to the country.</p>
      <p>“‘Yang prosecutor and the tweet. Nakita ko ‘yung tweet eh. ‘I am packed and ready to go and arrest Duterte.’ ‘Yan ang imbitahin mo? Ganun ang salita sa akin. P****** i**, Leni, sa harap mo sampalin ko ‘yan. Dalhin mo dito,” he said in a late-night media conference.</p>
      <p>Duterte said he took offense because critics are not giving him an opportunity to explain that the extrajudicial killings are not state sanctioned.</p>
      <p>Kine, who is now the head of research and investigations at the Physicians for Human Rights, a US-based non government organization, has always been vocal about “Duterte’s killing campaign,” following the over 6,000 people killed during anti-drug operations.</p>
      <p>Robredo has said that she hasn’t received a formal letter from Kine, but welcomed all help coming from the international community who are concerned with the Philippines’ drug war.</p>
