      <p>As <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/india-national-cricket-team">India</a> prepare to lock horns with Bangladesh in the final game of their ongoing two-Test series, skipper <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/virat-kohli">Virat Kohli</a> has set his sights on another incredible record.</p>
      <p>Kohli needs just 32 runs to take his tally to 5000 as captain which will make him the first Indian skipper to achieve the feat.</p>
      <p>If Kohli manages to score the required runs, he will also become just the sixth player to reach this unique milestone, joining an exclusive club consisting of Graeme Smith, Allan Border, Ricky Ponting, Clive Lloyd and Stephen Fleming.</p>
      <p>However, he is expected to have his work cut out considering the conditions on offer at Eden Gardens. Pink SG balls will be used for the day/night contest and Indian vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane has <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/india-vs-bangladesh-need-to-adjust-mentally-to-play-the-pink-ball-says-ajinkya-rahane-as-hosts-prepare-for-day-night-test">revealed</a> that the batters will have to deal with tremendous lateral movement.</p>
      <blockquote>“The lateral movement is big, actually a lot more than the red ball. Adjustment-wise, I’m sure everyone will adapt very quickly. We are used to playing different formats - after T20s we play Tests. It’s just the mindset, technical skills will play a role. Mentally if you can adjust to the pink ball, then it’ll be good.”</blockquote>
      <p>Kohli was dismissed for a duck in the first Test and will be itching to make amends this time around.</p>
      <p>As for India, the hosts completely outplayed Bangladesh in Indore, securing a comprehensive innings and 130-run victory. They will now look to seal the series when the action shifts to Eden Gardens for the historic day/night Test on Friday.</p>
