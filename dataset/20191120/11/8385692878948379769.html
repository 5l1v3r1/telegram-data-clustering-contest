      <h1>Redmi K30 Will Launch Next Month, Xiaomi's CEO Confirms</h1>

      <p>It is official, the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/xiaomi">Redmi</a> K30 will launch next month. This information has been <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/it-is-official-redmi-k30-is-launching-next-month-1620450-2019-11-19">confirmed</a> during the Xiaomi Developer Conference in Beijing. The person who confirmed it is the company's CEO, Lei Jun, reports India Today.</p>
      <p>In addition to the Redmi K30 launch info, he also talked about Xiaomi's 5G plans for 2020. Now, it is worth saying that Redmi's General Manager, Lu Weibing, said recently that the Redmi K30 will become available in January.</p>
      <h3>The Redmi K30 will launch in December, go on sale in January</h3>
      <p>If you're confused, don't be. The Redmi K30 will probably become official next month (in December), and will go on sale in January. Everything fits.</p>

      <p>Lei Jun did not reveal when exactly will the Redmi K30 arrive, though. The exact launch date will be published by Redmi, or its General Manager in the near future.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jun also said that the Redmi K30 will come with 5G support. Well, it's possible that both 4G and 5G variants of the phone will arrive. In fact, we're expecting to see two K30 models, the K30 and K30 Pro, even though Lei Jun did not mention them separately.</p>
      <p>5G is still not widespread, and releasing a 5G variant(s) only would not make too much sense. Those devices would needlessly be more expensive than they need to be because of 5G. Xiaomi is planning to release affordable 5G devices in 2020, though, soâ€¦ we'll have to wait and see. 5G only variants are also an option.</p>

      <p>The Redmi K30 is expected to be fueled by the Snapdragon 700 series processor. The Redmi K30 Pro, on the other hand, will almost certainly ship with the yet-unreleased Snapdragon 865.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi's CEO also let everyone know that all Xiaomi phones priced above CNY2,000 will come with 5G support in 2020. The company added that it will launch at least 10 5G smartphones next year.</p>
      <p>An earlier rumor suggested that the Redmi K30 series will include two punchole selfie cameras. Those two cameras are said to be located in the top-right corner of the display, similar to what we've seen on the Galaxy S10+.</p>

      <h3>The device(s) will arrive to Europe under Xiaomi's brand, not Redmi's</h3>
      <p>The Redmi K30 and K30 Pro will probably be re-launched for global markets under a different name. The Redmi K20 was relaunched as the Xiaomi Mi 9T, while the K20 Pro is available as the Mi 9T Pro.</p>
      <p>Going by that logic, the Redmi K30 will be available outside of China as the Xiaomi Mi 10T, and K30 Pro as the Mi 10T Pro.</p>
      <p>More information regarding the Redmi K30 and K30 Pro is expected to arrive soon, so stay tuned for that. The company is also expected to announce the phone's announcement date soon as well.</p>
