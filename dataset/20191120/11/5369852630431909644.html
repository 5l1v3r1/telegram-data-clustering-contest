      <p>IRELAND’S U15S ENJOYED a 2-1 friendly win over Poland at Eamonn Deacy Park last night.  </p>
      <p>Kevin Zefi of Shamrock Rovers scored the opener on 32 minutes and what a goal it was. </p>
      <p>The midfielder picked the ball up in his own half and set off on a mazy run — exchanging a one-two with Caden McLaughlin before gliding past a couple of defenders and stroking the ball into the bottom corner. </p>
      <p>Five minutes into the second half, Cork City defender Cathal Heffernan then doubled the advantage for Jason Donohue’s side. </p>
      <p>The son of Irish Olmpians Rob and Marian Heffernan, who made his debut in a 3-1 win over Latvia in October, headed home from close range after Sam Curtis had put Luke O’Brien’s half-cleared free-kick back into the danger area. </p>
      <p>Poland pulled one back two minutes later but Ireland claimed their fourth win from as many games. </p>
