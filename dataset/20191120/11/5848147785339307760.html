      <h1>Dutch find 25 migrants on UK-bound ferry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:48:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Authorities have found 25 migrants stowed away on a cargo ferry bound for Britain shortly after it left the Netherlands and the vessel quickly returned to the Dutch port of Vlaardingen, emergency services say.</p>
      <p>Two of the migrants were taken to hospital for treatment while the other 23 received a medical check-up in the port before being taken away by police for processing, a statement said on Tuesday (local time).</p>
      <p>Authorities found the migrants in a refrigerated container aboard the ferry. Sniffer dogs were being used to comb the vessel for other possible stowaways, it said.</p>
      <p>The migrants were aboard a Britannia Seaways ferry owned by Danish operator DFDS that had just embarked on a run across the North Sea to Felixstowe in southern England.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 23, <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/04/vietnamese-police-arrest-eight-people-in-connection-with-uk-truck-deaths/">39 bodies, all believed to be Vietnamese migrants</a>, were discovered in the back of a refrigerated truck near London. Two people have been charged in Britain and eight in Vietnam over the deaths.</p>
      <p>The container in which the bodies were found had arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
