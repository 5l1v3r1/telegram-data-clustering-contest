      <h1>Ringbrothers unveil one-of-a-kind Ford Mustang</h1>
      <h2>World-famous custom car builder and high-quality billet parts manufacturer, Ringbrothers unveiled the 1969 Mach 1 known as “UNKL”, in the Flowmaster (Holley) booth at the 2019 SEMA Show.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:07:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author">Autodealer</a></address>
      <p>UNKL is the first Mach 1 to leave the Spring Green, Wisconsin, shop after a series of memorable Mustang builds. The widened body and unique race-inspired theme make the most of road and race technology in one car.</p>
      <p>UNKL is powered by a 520-cubic-inch Jon Kaase Boss engine making 522kW. A reworked Bowler six-speed Tremec transmission backs the high-powered engine, and a QA1 carbon-fibre driveshaft transfers power to the rear wheels.</p>

      <p>The Mach 1’s growl comes from a custom stainless-steel Flowmaster exhaust. Prestone coolant keeps the engine at an even operating temperature, while Motul engine oil and gear oil keep things running smoothly.</p>
      <p>Custom BASF paint called Big Boss Blue has been laid over a smooth body, which was shaped with 3M products.</p>
      <p>Ringbrothers extended the Mach 1’s body by an inch on each side, which gives it a slightly more aggressive stance than the stock body without compromising the classic look.</p>

      <p>The car’s body is a mixture of carbon fibre and steel panels reshaped by Ringbrothers. Other custom details include billet tail lights, reshaped bumpers and trim and engine-bay accessories that were custom-machined at the Ringbrothers facility.</p>

      <p>The name for the build comes from the Ringbrothers owner, who enjoyed a close relationship with his uncle. The build pays tribute to his uncle’s influence on his passion for cars. The race-inspired livery continues that theme and will also serve a practical purpose when the car is used on track.</p>
      <p>UNKL uses Detroit Speed Engineering’s Aluma-Frame front suspension system with a cast aluminum cradle, custom-tuned steering rack, tubular suspension arms, and custom-adjustable RideTech coilovers.</p>
      <p>The rear is equipped with Detroit Speed’s QUADRALink suspension system and RideTech shocks. Front and rear sway bars are also from Detroit Speed. Stopping power is provided by Baer with huge 6S Extreme calipers.</p>

      <p>The custom interior of UNKL by Upholstery Unlimited feels as race-inspired as the exterior with supportive Recaro seats, Ringbrothers billet components, an Ididit steering column, gauges by Classic Instruments and a cabin kept at a comfortable temperature thanks to a Vintage Air Gen IV Magnum evap kit.</p>
