      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:03:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – The government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday has not yet decided to challenge the verdict of Lahore High Court (LHC) regarding allowing ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for medical treatment.<br/><br/>According to details, a thorough discussion on the matter will be held after issuance of comprehensive decision by the court.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the PTI leaders reportedly have different views on this issue as Federal Ministers for Science and Technology and Water Resources, Fawad Chaudhry and Faisal Vawda, are in support of moving the court against LHC verdict.  </p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Federal Cabinet, under the supervision of Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan had <a href="https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/519346-Federal-Cabinet-deliberates-LHC-verdict--Nawaz-Sharif-case"><b><i>deliberated upon the decision</i></b></a> of LHC on Nawaz Sharif matter and also discussed suggestions for further process.</p>
      <p>Later, <a href="http://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/519302-Nawaz-Sharif-to-depart-for-London-for-medical-treatment"><b><i>former PM had arrived at Heathrow Airport </i></b></a>in an air ambulance and reached his son Hassan Nawaz’s residence at the Avenfield Apartment of Sharif family at Park Lane. Shahbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif’s personal physician Dr Adnan were also with him.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the LHC had ordered to remove name of former premier from ECL and allowed him to travel abroad to get health treatment for four weeks.</p>
      <p>A two-member bench of LHC comprising Justice Ali Baqir Najfi and Justice Sardar Naeem rejected the condition of indemnity bond to be submitted by Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>The federal government had set condition for Nawaz Sharif to pay Rs7 billion surety bond if he wants to travel abroad for medical treatment. The government had also given only one time four-week permission to ailing Sharif to get his medical treatment in London.</p>
