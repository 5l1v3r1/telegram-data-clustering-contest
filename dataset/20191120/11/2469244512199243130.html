      <p>A Devon pub has been named as the most dog-friendly in the south west.</p>
      <p>The Ship Inn, Teignmouth has been declared the regional winner of Rover’s coveted Dog-friendly Pub Awards, after receiving the most votes from the public in the area.</p>
      <p>The seaside pub fought off fierce competition this year from over 335 dog-friendly watering holes across the South West, but held on to the top spot after accumulating the most votes.</p>
      <p>Locally renowned as a great pit stop after a nice long dog-walk, the pub is hailed for its welcoming approach, and dog amenities, including treats, secure garden and quiet areas.</p>

      <p>Ellie Cameron from The Ship Inn was delighted with the news.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s really lovely that being dog-friendly is a recognised feature of this pub. To be the most dog-friendly pub in our region is amazing as we know there were many to choose from, but we were lucky enough this year to take the crown.</p>
      <p>"It's shown us how supportive our customers are and that is something truly heartwarming.</p>
      <p>“It's important to us, as a pub, that we are dog friendly because we understand and value how much our customers pets mean to them, and how nice it is to share that part of their life with them.”</p>

      <p>Simon Le Grice from Rover said, “The South West has a fantastic array of dog-friendly pubs for locals to choose from. It’s been wonderful to see so many of them represented in this year’s awards. The community has really got behind their favourite pubs and helped us, for the fourth year running, to find the best of the bunch - and with the The Ship Inn at Teignmouth, we’ve found just that.</p>
      <p>“The superb service they demonstrated shows a real consideration for dog welfare and happiness, which we at Rover value above all. The whole Rover pack is proud to congratulate The Ship Inn on winning the Dog-friendly Pub Award for the South West and hopes that the awards will inspire dog owners country-wide to discover and support their local pubs, while also encouraging more pubs to consider our two-legged friends in their offerings.”</p>

Chosen from the regional finalists, the national winner, The Fox &amp; Hounds in Theale was selected by a panel of judges from Rover, RSPCA, The Morning Advertiser, Your Dog Magazine and The Guardian.</p>
