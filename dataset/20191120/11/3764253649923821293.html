      <p>The Argentine tactician was shown the exit door barely five years after leading them to their first-ever Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>Although they lost 2-0 to Liverpool after regulation period - his start to the new season has been awful as they currently rank 14th on the Premier League table.</p>
