      <p>President <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> has a new Republican competitor in the race to become US President: a transhumanist ‘cyborg’ called Zoltan Istvan.</p>
      <p>We’re used to hearing politicians promise the world and make huge promises they can never keep.</p>
      <p>But Istvan has perhaps the greatest ambition of any non-religious public figure in recent history because he wants to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/14/death-could-soon-become-a-curable-disease-9191393/">make death a curable diseas</a>e and encourage <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/14/death-could-soon-become-a-curable-disease-9191393/">humanity to meld with technology.</a></p>
      <p>He’ll be standing as a Republican presidential candidate – the second time he’s joined the race.</p>
      <p>He told Metro: ‘My team and I aim to make conservatives more open-minded about transhumanism and the future in the US.</p>
      <p>‘Right now, they are some of the most closed-minded folks on the planet.</p>
      <p>‘However, they’re pretty smart with their money, so now it’s my goal to get them to be open to the future too. It’s a very different way to take on Trump. It’s almost like we’re a Trojan Horse, but in a good way that both sides can appreciate.’</p>

      <p>He also drew attention to Trump’s health and questioned why he was taken into hospital recently.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t necessarily believe that it was a routine check-up,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘It may be something serious, since it was an unplanned visit.</p>
      <p>‘That said, I’m already on the New Hampshire ballot, and I will be the youngest, healthiest public figure conservative on that ballot.</p>
      <p>‘It’s first in the nation in primaries, so we if we can do well, we might be able to actually gain some real traction in this election. It’s how destiny goes sometimes.’</p>
      <p>Zoltan has some big ideas about how to change the US. He wants to ‘end the drug war’, phase out income tax, shrink government using ‘radical technology’ and enact ‘long term policies that defend science and technology from being overrun by socialist and authoritarian forces’.</p>
      <p>Essentially, he’s a libertarian who believes technology can enhance our freedoms if used correctly.</p>

      <p>He is an advocate of open borders, wants to see the formation of a global ‘world democratic government’ and believes every citizen should be given a universal basic income.</p>
      <p>As former leader of the US Transhumanist Party, Istvan is a passionate advocate of augmenting humans with machines. He’s already implanted a chip in his hand and hopes to enhance his physical capabilities further as technology develops.</p>
      <p>But he fears America is losing its innovative edge and will be overtaken by China. He’s also nervous about the rise of socialism and authoritarianism – which is most vividly represented by the activist left-wing democrats currently vying for power.</p>

      <p>In a statement, he wrote: ‘The speed of change we’ve seen in the last few decades is nothing compared to what’s on the horizon with the emergence of radical new technology and science.</p>
      <p>Already, California has major companies working on brain implants that connect our thoughts in real time to the internet. Artificial Intelligence has become one of the most important military issues of our time. And designer babies born through genetic editing are already alive.</p>
      <p>‘These innovations are part of the burgeoning field of transhumanism, the movement to enhance human bodies and lives with transformative technologies.</p>
      <p>‘I have dedicated my life to promoting transhumanism in a rational, objective, and fiscally conservative way. But transhumanism is under siege. Socialists, authoritarians, and the activist far-left want it for their own.</p>
      <p>‘If allowed, they’ll weaponize, stifle, and propagandize transhumanism until nobody wants this future because it’s downright dystopian. Getting to a bright future of transhumanism requires capitalistic entrepreneurialism and a hands-off approach from the government.’</p>
      <p>Istvan said he can ‘ no longer stand by and watch America fall short of its epic potential’ and added: ‘Under the current administration, America’s technological edge is slowly being handed on a platter to socialists and authoritarian powers.</p>
      <p>‘Even more important than Silicon Valley’s dangerous liberalism is that China is increasingly outdoing us in science and tech—the stuff that historically has bettered everyday American lives more than anything else. The writing is on the wall.</p>
      <p>‘While the White House offers faux populism, a phoney culture war, and regressive religious morality in the face of innovation, secular China is rushing forward to claim its mantle as the inevitable de facto world leader. Designer babies, artificial intelligence, and revolutionary green innovation—China has a leading grip on all these markets.’</p>
