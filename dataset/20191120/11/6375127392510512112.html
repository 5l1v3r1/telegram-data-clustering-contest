      <h3>The President has come to the defense of the people behind the purchase of the cauldron to be used during the 30th Southeast Asian Games which come off the wraps in less than two weeks at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</h3>
      <p>In a press briefing at Malacañang.yesterday, President Duterte said there’s nothing wrong with spending P50 million for the construction of the cauldron because it is a work of art, adding there was no corruption involved in the purchase.    </p>
      <p>“There can never be corruption in that situation because you commissioned a national artist (architect Bobby Manosa),” the President told reporters.</p>
      <p>“Si Mañosa was commissioned by the government to create ‘yung nakita mo ‘yung kaldero ngayon. It is the product of the mind. You cannot estimate nalugi ka because it is the rendition of the mind of the creator,” Duterte added.</p>
      <p>He also said the government cannot do anything about the price if it was what the artist asked for.</p>
      <p>“Kung ‘yan ang singil niya, eh ’di sabihin niya, eh di ‘wag mong bilhin kung ayaw mo. ‘Yan ang presyo ko,” Duterte said.</p>
      <p>House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano earlier justified the price of the cauldron, after Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon described it as an “unnecessary extravagance”, calling it a ‘kaldero’.</p>
      <p>The Philippines’ SEA Games cauldron is “cheaper” than Singapore’s P62-million piece, said Cayetano, who also chairs the Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC).</p>
      <p>“Ang cauldron ay isang monumento. Isa itong simbolo. Isa itong work of art. Ito ay isang requirement sa lahat ng games because it symbolizes the games’ competition, spirit,” he told reporters on the sidelines of the Senate budget hearings.</p>
