      <p>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. &gt;&gt; The parents of Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa say the support the family has received “is nothing short of amazing.”</p>
      <p>Galu and Diane Tagovailoa issued a statement today through Alabama’s athletic department and on Facebook. Tua Tagovailoa, a Saint Louis alum, had surgery Monday in Houston for a dislocated right hip suffered in the Mississippi State game. The team’s surgeon, Dr. Lyle Cain, predicted a full recovery for the Crimson Tide star, who has been projected as a high NFL draft pick.</p>
      <p>The statement thanks “all of the Alabama family and everyone across the world for the prayers and outpouring of love and support for our son and our family.”</p>
      <p>It also says the family has “felt the unceasing prayer, and words can’t express how overwhelming and uplifting that has been for us.”</p>
