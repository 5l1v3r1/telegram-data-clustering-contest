      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/david-beckham/">David Beckham</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/millie-bobby-brown/">Millie Bobby Brown</a> are set to appear at a global summit at the UN, to celebrate World Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>Just in case you couldn’t stan them any harder.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> footballer and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> actress will be headlining UNICEF’s event in New York, to commemorate World Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>And they will be taking the opportunity to demand action over the promotion and protection of child rights.</p>
      <p>Victoria Beckham’s husband has been working with the charity for nearly two decades, and – discussing why he decided to get involved – the 44-year-old explained: ‘Children everywhere dream of a better future.</p>
      <p>‘I have worked with UNICEF for almost 20 years and I have met children in all corners of the world, young people that have ambitions for a better education, a life free from disease and for peace.</p>

      <p>‘All children deserve the opportunity to reach their potential and I’m very proud to support the young people speaking up for change today.’</p>

      <p>While Millie, 15, continued: ‘Young people my age are facing so many new challenges today that 30 years ago were hard to predict.</p>
      <p>‘I’m proud to add my voice to all those around the world who are asking for solutions to today’s problems such as bullying, access to education, mental health awareness, suicide prevention and climate change.’</p>
      <p>The teenager recently made headlines after opening up about being a role model to youngsters, and how it makes her consider her appearance more.</p>
      <p>Millie came to fame thanks to her role as Eleven in Netflix sci-fi drama Stranger Things, alongside Finn Wolfhard and Noah Schnapp.</p>

      <p>But she courted controversy when discussing her wardrobe with Harper’s Bazaar, revealing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/stranger-things-millie-bobby-brown-15-wants-to-show-off-womanhood-with-more-fitted-clothes-11165163/">she wants to wear more ‘fitted clothes’ in the future</a>.</p>
      <p>‘I would really enjoy wearing more fitted clothes now,’ she said in the candid chat. ‘I feel like I’m becoming someone and being a woman so I just want to show that.’</p>
      <p>Speaking about being a role model, she added: ‘I think about the girls who are going to look at the picture – those young girls that are going to look at me and if they think, “Wow that’s what I should dress up as”.</p>

      <p>‘They are my age, so those are the ones I think of.</p>
      <p>‘I want to make sure that I’m influencing being your age and being who you are in that time of your life.’</p>
