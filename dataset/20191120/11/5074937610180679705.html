      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:25:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Kpebesaane Cynthia, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Lawra (UW/R), Nov. 18, GNA – Mr Martin Bomba-ire, the Lawra Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) has broken the ground for the construction of a neonatal intensive care center in the Lawra Municipal Hospital to take care premature babies or those with complications.</p>
      <p>The funding of the project is from the one million dollar per constituency fund, and it is expected to be completed within three months from the day of commencement of work.</p>
      <p>Mr Bomba-ire said the construction of the facility becomes necessary due to exigency of the neonatal intensive care centre and expressed the hope that the completion of the project will improve healthcare delivery in the area.</p>
      <p>He said the NPP government was committed to redeeming its campaign promises hence the need to use funds from the one constituency one million dollars to embark on infrastructure development to improve the living conditions of the people.</p>
      <p>He appealed to the contractor to work hard to complete the project on schedule to justify the confidence reposed in him, saying, “Work hard to finish the project on schedule so that the hospital will get a facelift as well as reduce premature deaths”.</p>
      <p>Mr Ziem Bernard, the Medical Doctor of the Hospital, thanked the MCE and the MP and all those who worked hard to ensure the construction of the project came into fruition and assured that the Hospital will work harder to improve healthcare delivery.</p>
      <p>The center will consist of an office, babies’ ward, a changing room both for mothers and staffs, a water closet toilet facility and a store room among others.</p>
