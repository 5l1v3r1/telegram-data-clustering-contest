      <h1>Club to ask player to get move away from Crystal Palace, want reduced fee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:33:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fotomac.com.tr/">Fotomac</a> report Trabzonspor will soon begin the operation to sign Crystal Palace’s Alexander Sörloth on a permanent basis and are seeking help from the player to complete the move.</p>
      <p>The 23 year old has been in excellent form since joining the Turkish club on loan in the summer and that’s led to rumours Trabzonspor want to purchase him outright.</p>
      <p>They have the option to make the move permanent by paying €6m to Crystal Palace but Fotomac report Karadeniz Firtinasi are looking to reduce his price to €4m.</p>
      <p>To achieve this the Turkish side are hoping the Norwegian striker will inform the Premier League club about his intention to stay in Trabzon.</p>

      <p>After making a great start to the season in the Super Lig, Sörloth has now scored four goals in his last three games for Norway.</p>
      <p>Trabzonspor’s loan agreement for Sörloth will run until June 2021, and the Norwegian is under contract with Crystal Palace until June 2022.</p>
