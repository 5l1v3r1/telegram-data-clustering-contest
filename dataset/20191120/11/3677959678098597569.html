      <p><a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-first-update-stuttering-issues/">Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</a> does its very best to make players feel like Jedi, but it seems like the game's mechanics are not enough for some fans.</p>
      <p>Twitch streamer Rudeism created a working Lightsaber controller to use for the game's combat. He also created a glove controller to simulate the Force. Needless to say, this is very impressive, and the game looks even more fun.</p>

      <blockquote>I've been working on this build for a while now - initially, it was just the lightsaber, but if you have the option to put in 1:1 Force powers, why wouldn't you?<br/>The lightsaber has a bunch of LEDs that light up when you flick the blade out, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) inside that detects swings (and deactivates when the blade is retracted), a couple of thumbsticks on it for aiming and D-pad commands, as well as a bunch of buttons for things like jumping/dodging/etc. The glove handles movement via a thumbstick, as well as another IMU for Force powers! It's a ton of fun to use, and it might be my new favourite thing in the world now.<br/>Just gotta beat the game - I started off on Jedi Knight difficulty, but I decided to crank it up to max difficulty just to see if I can. Managed to take out the second boss, so I think it's got promise!</blockquote>
