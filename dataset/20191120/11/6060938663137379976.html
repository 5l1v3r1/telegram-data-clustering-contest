      <p><b><u>CLAIM<br/></u></b>Many social media users are sharing two photos showing middle-aged women being taken away by police personnel with a claim that these women are students of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), protesting against a recent hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user who goes by the handle '@happyappy83' posted two photos along with a caption in Hindi that translates to, "It's not okay to torture little girls studying in JNU. If they don't finish their studies at such a young age, how will they make a career and how will they get married? Poor girls."</p>

      <p>The same two photos are being shared by other users as well, with captions that make more or less similar claims. For instance:</p>

        <u>
          <b>TRUTH</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>The photos that are being shared with a claim that the women seen in it are JNU students are old and clicked during protests that had nothing to do with JNU and the recent hostel fee hike there.</p>
      <p>One of the images was clicked in 2017 in Hyderabad during a protest in front of Labour Commission Office there, demanding minimum wage, and is credited to the Press Trust of India. The other image is courtesy Associated Press, and was clicked during a protest in Delhi in May this year when members of various organisations were detained for protesting against a Supreme Court in-house committee giving clean chit to then Chief Justice of India (CJI) <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ranjan-gogoi">Ranjan Gogoi</a>.</p>

      <p>A simple reverse-image search on the image on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Google">Google</a> will lead you to a photo gallery published on the website of Outlook Magazine. The caption of the image said, "Police arrests a woman who was participating in a protest demanding for minimum wage, at labour Commissioner Office in Hyderabad."</p>

      <p>A reverse-image search on the image will lead you to multiple media reports that had used this image in May, 2019. A <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deccan-Chronicle">Deccan Chronicle</a> <a href="https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/080519/cji-sexual-harassment-case-victim-asks-panel-for-copy-of-inquiry-repo.html">report</a> titled, 'CJI sexual harassment case: Victim asks panel for copy of inquiry report' carried the exact same image. The caption of the image said, "Members of various organisations being detained as they protest against Supreme Court in-house committee in New Delhi on Tuesday."</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/img/72142841/Master.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It is clear that the photo was clicked in May when members of various organisations were detained for protesting against a Supreme Court in-house committee giving clean chit to then Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi.</p>
      <p>The protests during which the above two photos were clicked have nothing to do with the ongoing JNU protests.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>VERDICT</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Times Fact Check has found that old, unrelated photos are being shared with a claim that women seen in these photos are students of Jawaharlal Nehru University. The claim is hence false.</p>
