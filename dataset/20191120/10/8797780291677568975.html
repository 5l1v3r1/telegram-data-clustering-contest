      <h1>Cats: Watch the new trailer for the $300 million adaptation</h1>

      <p>No, that number in the headline is not a typo. According to a recent report from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/21/film-trailer-cats-ts-eliot">Guardian</a> (who are usually on the money for these things), the upcoming live-action feature film adaptation of classic Broadway musical Cats cost somewhere in the region of $300 million to make. That is a ludicrous amount of money to pay for nightmares.</p>
      <p>And nightmares is exactly what director Tom Hooper and co will be giving us thanks to the mind-boggling decision to have his star-studded cast morphed into glaringly unnatural cat-human hybrids through ridiculously expensive CGI effects. Whatever happed to just painting actors noses black, dabbing on some whiskers, big fluffy hairpieces and some cat ears and calling it a day? Because honestly, that worked brilliantly for the nearly 40 years that Cats has been selling out stage performances across the world.</p>

      <p>Instead, we’re getting tortured by the types of eldritch horrors you will find prancing around in this brand new, strangely singing-free trailer for Cats. Check it out below.</p>
      <blockquote>Over the course of a single night, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles make what is known as “the Jellicle choice” and decide which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.</blockquote>

      <p>Ok, I will admit, it’s not all horrific nightmares, because Taylor Swift as a cat has left me with some very confusing sexual feelings. Furries, I think I’m finally starting to understand you.</p>
      <p>Cats also stars James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, and Rebel Wilson, with newcomer Francesca Hayward taking the lead in her first feature-film role. Along with helming, Hooper – the Oscar-winning director behind The King’s Speech, Les Miserables, and The Danish Girl – also co-wrote the script for the film with acclaimed playwright and screenwriter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot, Rocketman).</p>
      <p>That is certainly a hell of a lot of talent, and normally that – and the perverse car-crash fascination that attracts certain people – may have been enough to draw in a big enough audience to make back that production cost. However, Cats is currently scheduled to open on 20 December, the exact same day as Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. This is going to be a slaughter so bad that animal rights activists may start protesting in the streets.</p>
