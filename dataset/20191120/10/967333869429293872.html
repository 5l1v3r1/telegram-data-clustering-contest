        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik):  Thousands of students have been staging a strike and demonstration against the Draft Hostel Manual and its provisions for fee hikes, dress codes and curfews. But the worsening situation at the university appears to be nudging some B-town personalities to lend their support.</b>

      <p>As students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), one of India’s premier educational institutions, continue to stage demonstrations against a soon-to-be-imposed fee hike, Bollywood actors like Swara Bhasker and veteran actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha have sent them messages of support on social media.</p>
      <p>The move comes two days after a protest march to Parliament organised by the JNU Students' Union that reportedly resulted in many students getting injured.</p>
      <p>In a Twitter thread, actress Swara Bhasker says that “JNU changes lives because education changes lives.”</p>
