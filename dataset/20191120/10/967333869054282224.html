        <b>TEL AVIV (Sputnik) - Israeli Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose mandate ends Wednesday midnight, failed to put their differences aside and agree on a unity government at a last-ditch meeting in Jerusalem, The Times of Israel reported.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>“We can not give up [our] basic principles and values,” Gantz said according to The Times of Israel newspaper, in a statement following the meeting which took place on Tuesday.</blockquote>
      <p>Gantz added that he would “continue to make every effort and turn every stone to try to reach understandings and form a government even in the remaining time, in order to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910231077124207-israel-may-be-heading-for-3rd-election-with-gantz-unlikely-to-end-deadlock-in-govt-talks/">prevent costly and unnecessary elections</a> that are contrary to the will of the citizens of Israel.”</p>
      <p>The main point of contention became Gantz's insistence on including parliamentary bloc Joint List, made up of Arab members of parliament, into the coalition, according to the Haaretz publication. Right-wing nationalist Netanyahu is categorically opposed to sharing power with Arab-Israeli politicians.</p>
      <p>It now falls upon former Defenсe Minister Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the third-largest party Yisrael Beitenu, to pick sides. Having found himself in the position of kingmaker, Lieberman will announce his stance at a party meeting scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>After the first Knesset elections in April, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201907291076391476-israels-election-banks-on-modi-netanyahu-bonhomie-indian-twitterati-suggest/">Netanyahu had the opportunity</a> to form a new government coalition, with the support of the largest number of elected deputies (55). However, for the 28 days allotted to him by law, he failed to assemble a coalition of a parliamentary majority of 61 seats.</p>
      <p>The second election in September saw Gantz pull slightly ahead, but his party was still short of a majority. In the event that Ganz’s efforts are also unsuccessful, the right to form a government can be granted to any deputy who can unite 61 parliamentarians in one coalition. Otherwise, Israel may head to a third election in less than a year.</p>
