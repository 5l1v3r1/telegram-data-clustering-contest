          <b>A child's heartbreaking letter to Santa Claus has gone viral on Twitter. </b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The image was shared by Labour Councillor Gerard Woodhouse, who was visiting the L6 Centre in Liverpool to help with Christmas food hampers for those in need.</p>
      <p>While there, Woodhouse stumbled upon a child's letter to Santa which was being stored in the centre's Santa post box before it was sent to his workshop in the North Pole.</p>
      <p>The heartbreaking letter was from a seven-year-old child, who asked Santa for a home for her family and some food. Woodhouse explains "Last week @L6 Centre we started getting down Xmas decorations we placed The Santa postbox in the cafe until grotto is set up. Today I went in to sort food parcels for residents while passing post box I looked in it. Just read a seven-year-old's letter."</p>

      <p>The letter reads: "Dear Father Christmas, can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas? Mam wants us to be all together can you give us some food and can I have just a nice doll for Christmas. Thank you."</p>
      <p>The letter is getting a massive reaction, standing as a strong reminder as the difficulties many people face all year round, particularly in the colder months.</p>
      <p>On person says "I'm in tears reading it." Another says "Tried to read it out to my husband, couldn't finish it."</p>
      <p>While the identity of the family has been kept anonymous, many have reached out to ask if they could help in this way.</p>
