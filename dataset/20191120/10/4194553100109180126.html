      <h1>20-year-old forgotten left-back Gallacher trains with Klopp’s first-team</h1>

      <p>Not many will remember Liverpool signing Tony Gallacher from Falkirk back in January 2018…</p>
      <p>The then-teenager arrived from Scotland to compete for our U23s – but we’ve barely heard about him since.</p>
      <p>The likes of Adam Lewis and Yasser Larouci have been given the occasional chance in friendlies at left-back, but Gallacher, now 20, has never been in contention.</p>
      <p>
        <b>During the international break though, the Scot has been training with the first-teamers not away on duty with their countries which according to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/jurgen-klopp-calls-upon-exciting-youngsters-before-liverpools-internationals-return/">This Is Anfield</a> is ‘rare’…</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool have another left-back coming through the ranks in Colombian Anderson Arroyo, but he’s currently on loan at Mladá Boleslav in the Czech Republic!</p>
      <p>Out of the current crop of young left-backs, we have highest hopes for Larouci based on what we saw in the pre-season friendlies – but it’ll be a very long time before one of them is competing with Andy Robertson for minutes.</p>
      <p>James Milner is his first reserve, and we may see the vice-captain v Crystal Palace on Saturday due to Robbo’s injury.</p>
