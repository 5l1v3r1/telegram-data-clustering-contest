      <h1>Geek Retreat to open in Nottingham - with special appearance from Star Wars' Mike Quinn</h1>
      <h2>It's cool to be geeky</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:09:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:09</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>Geek Retreat, the UK’s leading 'geek hangout' chain, is opening an outlet in Nottingham at the end of the month.</p>
      <p>Described as a comic book store, cafe and events hub rolled into one, there are already nine Geek Retreat stores in the UK in cities including Glasgow, Newcastle and Birmingham.</p>
      <p>The store will open in Flying Horse Walk in the unit which used to be occupied by bridal wear shop <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/shopping/how-former-berketex-bride-wedding-2529656">Berketex</a>, which closed after the firm collapsed last year.</p>
      <p>The store will stock 'geek culture' merchandise such as comics, posters, clothing, figures, collectables and memorabilia, as well as games and gaming accessories.</p>
      <p>There will also be events with geek culture at their heart including comic book signings, games tournaments and quizzes.</p>
      <p>Specialising in trading card games, they will cater for kids and beginners with their learn-to-play sessions to tournaments for more experienced players for popular games including Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh!</p>
      <p>Geek Retreat will also stock an extensive selection of free-to-read graphic novels and free-to-play board games and games consoles making it perfect for families.</p>

      <p>It’s not all games though, as Geek Retreat specialise in milkshakes including: Chocolate Thunder - a decadent ice cream milkshake containing Nutella, Maltesers, Oreos and chocolate sauce; Rainbow Dash - a skittles and strawberry shake; and Jaffa the Hutt - a smooth blend of ice cream and Jaffa Cakes.</p>
      <p>If a milkshake doesn’t take your fancy, choose from their selection of hot and cold drinks, American candy, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/food-drink-nottinghams-winter-wonderland-3549680">burgers</a>, hot dogs, panini and nachos, keeping you fuelled up while you play.</p>
      <p>The shop, at the lower entrance of the shopping arcade in St Peter’s Gate, is a franchise for Graham Palk, along with fellow directors Owen Hilyard-Todd and Ross T. Price.</p>
      <p>Graham said: “We’ve wanted to open a business of this nature for some time and when we came across this franchise opportunity, we thought it was perfect.</p>
      <p>"We were looking for suitable premises and when we came across the unit in Flying Horse Walk, with its size and location, in the heart of the city, it seemed just perfect. We can’t wait to open our doors to the people of Nottingham.”</p>
