      <p>FOLLOWING THE DISAPPOINTMENT of the senior side’s failure to secure automatic qualification for Euro 2020 on Monday, the performance and result produced by the Ireland U21s at Tallaght Stadium last night was just the tonic.</p>
      <p>Despite trailing at the interval, Stephen Kenny’s side produced a superb second-half display to record a 4-1 victory over Sweden, who had taken an 18th-minute lead through Brighton &amp; Hove Albion striker Victor Gyokeres.</p>
      <p>After some half-time adjustments, Celtic defender Lee O’Connor levelled the game shortly after the restart, before goals from Adam Idah, Troy Parrott and Zack Elbouzedi gave the home team what was ultimately a convincing victory.</p>
