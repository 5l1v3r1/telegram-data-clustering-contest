      <p>The vagina is a very sensitive part of the woman’s body. There are so many people with different rules and laws about what should be put in a vagina, some of these rules are detrimental to the vagina’s health, however, many people have little idea about things that should not be done to the vagina.</p>
      <p>Below are some things that should not be done to your vagina.</p>
      <p><b>Douches</b><br/>Whoever told you to clean your vagina with douches is misleading you. Dr. Alyssa Dweck, M.D., a gynecologist and Assistant Clinical Professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, says douches can cause “a horrible imbalance of the typical bacteria that is supposed to be in the vagina and actually cause an infection.”</p>
      <p>However, if you think something smells off in your vagina, see. Ultimately, your vagina is self-cleaning, so it doesn’t need your help to make it cleaner.</p>
      <p><b>Steaming</b><br/>Vagina steaming involves exposing the vagina to steam to cleanse it and enhance its health. Other names for the practice include V-steaming or yoni steaming.</p>
      <p>People who practice vaginal steaming believe the herbs can penetrate vaginal tissues and offer a variety of benefits.</p>
      <p>According to Medical News Today, the primary safety concern is that the steam could burn the sensitive vaginal tissues if it is too hot. Adding extra moist heat to the vagina and exposing the vagina to certain additives within the steam could also increase a woman’s risk for yeast or bacterial infections.</p>
      <p><b>Vaseline</b><br/>This is occasionally thought of as an easy form of lubricant, but according to Dweck, Vaseline or any other type of petroleum product can actually be a source of infection in the vagina.</p>
      <p><b>Scented Things</b><br/>If you observe something smells off, see your doctor. Your vagina is not a dirty cloth, do not spray scented things in or around it. The moment you add scents or flavors to the balance, your pH level will be affected and you could end up with an infection, or just general discomfort and a more pungent smell.</p>
      <p>Whatever questions or discomforts you have, ensure you discuss with your doctor always.</p>
