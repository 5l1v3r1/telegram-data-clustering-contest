      <p>"Two surgeries over the past 10 days under the magical hands of Dr Kumara Ekanayake and the incredible staff at St James's."</p>
      <p>The mother of three went on to thank those close to her for their support and kind thoughts during this difficult time for her.</p>
      <p>Yvonne added: "Thanks too to all my friends and family and to those who sent such lovely messages of support."</p>

      <p>Following the event, she told RSVP Magazine: "I sat on my first racehorse in April and it was a pretty daunting experience. I very quickly got fit and got my confidence and Jessica is an amazing woman."</p>

      <p>Yvonne went on to say that injuries are part and parcel of the sports of horse racing and show jumping.</p>
      <p>"Ali got a new pony last summer and she broke her wrist and needed surgery, it was heartbreaking," she explained.</p>
      <p>"Some people might say 'Why do you let her do it?' but when you can’t stop somebody when they have a passion like that.</p>
      <p>"You could slip walking down the street or get hit by a car, you can’t wrap kids up in cotton wool. For me too, I love it and I take every precaution, but you have got to expect that you might fall or have an injury."</p>
