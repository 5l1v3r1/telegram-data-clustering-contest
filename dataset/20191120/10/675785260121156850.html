      <h2>A mum has gone viral on social media after sharing a powerful message to a shop, calling on them to remove the 'gendered' labels they put on their items of clothing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:15:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Courtney Pochin, https://www.facebook.com/courtneypochinmirror/?modal=admin_todo_tour</a></address>
      <p>A store has come under fire from a frustrated parent for using 'gendered' clothing labels.</p>
      <p>India Springle, from New Zealand has called out Kmart and urged them to remove 'boys' and 'girls' labels from children's clothes.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">mum</a> shared an impassioned message on social media revealing that her two-year-old daughter Lola had fallen in love with a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dinosaurs">dinosaur</a> top from the shop.</p>
      <p>However inside the item was a label proclaiming that it was meant for boys aged between one and seven.</p>

      <p>In a post on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>, which went viral but has since been removed, Springle said children should be able to "wear whichever clothes they choose".</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Hey Kmart.. get with the program already would you?!</p>
      <p>"Even my nearly three-year-old thinks your gender labels are bull. Why the hell are all the cool t-shirts labelled 'boys' - what makes this t-shirt a boy's t-shirt anyway?"</p>
      <p>The mum continued: "Girls can only wear a dinosaur t-shirt if it's pink and full of sequins?! Honestly it is beyond ridiculous get in the modern world you archaic bunch of fossils...down with gendered kids clothes and down with lame girls clothes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Sure there are heaps of bigger things going on in the world right now but I happen to think that it is pretty important to allow out children to wear whichever clothes they choose and not feel shame or stigma because that piece of clothing has been assigned to a specific gender."</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7699695/Mother-India-Springle-calls-Kmart-ditch-boys-girls-labels-kids-clothing-range.html">Mail Online,</a> a spokesperson for Kmart said: "At Kmart our store design is set up to assist customers with a convenient shopping experience based on their shopping behaviour.</p>
      <p>"At Kmart we are consistently listening to our customers and incorporating their feedback to both future product ranges and store design."</p>
      <p>Many people online agreed with Springle's comments.</p>
      <p>One person replied: "Ridiculous, I cannot understand in this day and age why I have to go to the boys section to get even just a plain black t-shirt and black jeans for my two-and-a-half-year old girl. Labelled boys - WTF. It's mental."</p>
      <p>However some people thought she was overreacting.</p>
      <p>A different user wrote: "Just buy the shirt, cut the tag off, they're annoying anyway and keep on with your day."</p>
      <p>Someone else added: "Why does it matter so much about the words written in the label? Your daughter looks delightfully happy in her dinosaur top so why make an issue out of nothing."</p>
