      <h1>'Stick with us!' Matt Taylor's impassioned plea to Exeter City fans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:45:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart James</a></address>
      <p>Exeter City manager matt Taylor has issued an impassioned plea for supporters to stick with his team after back-to-back home games at St James Park yielded only one goal.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, City were held to a goalless draw by a Cheltenham Town side that showed little in the way of attacking invention, but that was surpassed by Cambridge United in Tuesday night’s FA Cup first round replay, who spent almost the entire game defending and just trying to keep the Grecians at bay.</p>
      <p>When Lee Martin forced Callum Burton into the first meaningful save of the game with over an hour on the clock, it led to ironic cheers and some fans sarcastically started to sing ‘we’ve had a shot.’</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Alex Fisher settled the contest with the only goal of the game to set up a second round clash with Hartlepool United, but while Taylor accepted it was a case of gallows humour, he wants fans to stick with his team when they are trying to find a route to goal instead.  </p>
      <p>“I can’t stress how difficult it is to break teams down that sit behind the ball,” Taylor said. “Unless you are a Barcelona or Manchester City, it is not an easy thing to do and you want that moment of quality, or a mistake – some bit of good play and we saw that in the second half.</p>
      <p>“But in those moments of uncertainty, the message is that everyone has to stick together.</p>
      <p>“There was a bit of sarcasm and we have to be honest about that, but it is not easy breaking a team down.</p>
      <p>“That is probably a sign of the respect that teams are showing us and it will be different when we go away from home – maybe we will play a different game plan and invite teams onto us – but that’s not the way we want to play. We want to try and win games of football.</p>
      <p>“It is frustrating and sometimes, we haven’t got all the answers to break teams down, whether that is quality or an opportunity. We were so close on Saturday with the slip (against Cheltenham), that was our clear chance, and on Wednesday, the substitutions made the difference, but you have to be in the game in order to do that.”</p>
      <p>Taylor is certainly right in what he says and it should be noted that Cheltenham had only one shot on target in Saturday’s League Two clash, while Cambridge failed to register a single shot on target on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Goalkeeper Jonny Maxted and the City defenders deserve great credit for such resilience, even if the opposition are setting up with the sole intention of defending.</p>
      <p>“It only takes one goal, but my message to the fans is that I want them to stick with us,” Taylor reiterated. “This group of players are not perfect, I know that, but we should be getting stronger, we should be getting better and there are times when we will frustrate the life out of them. But they have to stick with us.</p>
      <p>“We will always try and give them something to cheer about, we now have a (second round) FA Cup tie to look forward to and you never know what happens after that.</p>
      <p>“It shows where we are and I don’t have the answers. I am not a genius like (Pep) Guardiola who plays against ten bodies camped out on the edge of the penalty box every single week. At the moment, we are having to do that and if it continues, we will practice against it, but it is not an easy thing.</p>
      <p>“We are League Two players and a League Two team. We have to be patient with each other, we have to be patient on the pitch and believe it would come and thankfully it did.”</p>
      <p>City fans are reminded that the second round clash with Hartlepool has been moved to Sunday, December 1 as it will feature on BBC’s Final Score coverage and will kick-off at 2pm.</p>
      <p>The Grecians will collect £12,500 for the privilege, which will come as a welcome cash boost, along with the £36,000 they collected for seeing off Cambridge.</p>
      <p>The winners between City and Hartlepool will pick up a further £54,000 as well as a place in the potentially lucrative third round draw, where the Premier League clubs enter the competition.</p>
