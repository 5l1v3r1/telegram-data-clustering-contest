      <h1>Alleged destruction of evidence: Court adjourns until Jan. 27, 2020 for Metuh’s defence</h1>

      <p>An FCT High Court, Maitama, on Wednesday fixed Jan. 27, 2020 for Olisa Metuh, a former PDP spokesman, charged with criminal destruction of evidence to open his defence.</p>
      <p>Metuh was arraigned alongside his company, Desita by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC ) in January 2015 on a two-count charge bordering on alleged destruction of evidence.</p>
      <p>The case slated for commencement of defence on Wednesday was further adjourned at the instance of the court.</p>
      <p>The counsel on the matter were all present, the defendant, Metuh was also present but the court did not sit and date was agreed on by all the parties.</p>
      <p>The judge, Justice Ishaq Bello, on Oct. 17 , in his ruling on the no- case- submission filed by Metuh, ordered him to enter defence .</p>
      <p>He said a prima facie case was established against him by the prosecuting counsel, Mr Sylvanus Tahir.</p>
      <p>Bello said that the “view of this court” after reviewing arguments by parties, “is that the application for a no-case -submission is lacking in merit. It is hereby dismissed.”</p>
      <p>He thereby ordered Metuh to enter his defence and adjourned the trial until Nov 20 for the defendant to open his defence.</p>
      <p>Metuh’s counsel, Dr Onyechi Ikpeazu, SAN, had on Oct. 10, 2017, told the court that they would enter a no-case submission at the close of the prosecution’s case.</p>
      <p>Arguing in the no-case submission, Ikpeazu had told the court that the prosecution had not established any case to warrant the defendant to be called to enter his defence.</p>
      <p>He said that the application was in pursuant to the provisions of Sections 302 and 357 of ACJA.</p>
      <p>The counsel added that the defendant had a constitutional liberty and could not be prosecuted where he either refused to make a statement or withdraw any part of his writing in the course of making a statement.</p>

      <p>Ikpeazu said that the defendant also had a right to cancel any part of his statement voluntarily.</p>
      <p>He reminded the court that the charge by EFCC was that Metuh destroyed his statement and obstructed EFCC officials by willfully tearing his statement.</p>
      <p>Ikpeazu argued that a piece of paper not signed did not qualify as a statement by the defendant, and urged the court to discharge and acquit the defendant.</p>
      <p>However, the prosecuting counsel Mr Sylvanus Tahir, urged the court to establish whether or not a prima facie case had been made against the defendant</p>
      <p>Tahir added that cancellation was different from tearing which was obstruction, and prayed the court to call upon the defendant to enter his defence.</p>
