      <h2>Palestinian Authority chief declares Trump administration's peace plan dead, expresses hope for Israeli 'peace government'.</h2>

      <p>President Donald Trump’s much-anticipated Middle East peace plan, dubbed the “Deal of the Century”, is already dead, Palestinian Authority chief Mahmoud Abbas declared Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Israel’s <i>Galei Tzahal</i>, Abbas said the Trump administration’s declaration that it does not view Israeli communities in Judea and Samaria as illegal was the final nail in the coffin for the yet-to-be-released peace plan.</p>
      <p>“From the very beginning we said that the Deal of the Century doesn’t have a foundation. After what Pompeo said, it’s now dead.”</p>
      <p>Abbas added that the US does not have the authority to contradict international rulings.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday that the US does not view Israeli towns in Judea and Samaria as being in violation of international law, a break with the previous administration’s position.</p>
      <p>Turning to Israeli-PA negotiations, Abbas claimed that he had repeatedly offered to meet with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, but was turned down.</p>
      <p>“The last time we met was in the year 2010.”</p>
      <p>While Abbas refused to endorse any particular candidate for the Israeli premiership, the PA leader said he hoped for a government that would ‘pursue peace’.</p>
