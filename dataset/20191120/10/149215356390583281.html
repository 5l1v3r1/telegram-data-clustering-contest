      <p>Washington was consumed with <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879584/watch-5-key-moments-from-tuesdays-impeachment-hearings">Day 3 of the impeachment hearings</a> on Tuesday, but "there's an even bigger scandal rocking D.C. today, and — just a warning — if you have small children at home, you should probably bring them over to the TV to watch this," Trevor Noah said on Tuesday's <i>Daily Show</i>. "This" was a clip of Rep. Eric Swalwell's (D-Calif.) Monday night interview on MSNBC's Hardball being interrupted by <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879317/msnbcs-hardball-deflates-conspiracy-theory-about-rep-eric-swalwell-audibly-breaking-wind-live-tv">what sounded an awful lot like very loud flatulence</a>.</p>
      <p>"That was a fart on live TV, and it was a loud fart, too," Noah cringed. He played it again. "Yeah, that was unmistakably a giant fart," he said, adding that to be fair to Swalwell, "it could have been the host, Chris Matthews. In fact, this is the viral argument that everyone has been talking about online: Who let it rip?" MSNBC blamed it on a mug scraping across the desk and Swalwell claimed "TOTAL EXONERATION!" Correspondent Desi Lydic didn't buy it. Along with his body language, "Swalwell's quick denial is the biggest tell of all," she said. "Might I remind you, Trevor, that the law says: 'He who denied it, supplied it.' It's right there in the Constitution."</p>

      <p>Stephen Colbert had the same joke on <i>The Late Show</i>.</p>

      <p><i>The Tonight Show</i>'s Jimmy Fallon ran with it, a little sheepishly. "The other big political story is that the hashtag #Fartgate was trending yesterday after people thought Rep. Eric Swalwell may have passed gas on live TV," he said. "I guess we finally know who the whistleblower is." He showed other poorly timed TV farts and managed to work in Baby Yoda. Watch below.
