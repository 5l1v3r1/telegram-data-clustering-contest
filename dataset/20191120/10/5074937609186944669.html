      <h1>Christians urged to live their lives according to the teachings of Christ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:27:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Priscilla Obour, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 19, GNA – Reverend Emmanuel Obour, the Kumasi Maakro District Minister of the Presbyterian Church of Ghana, has urged Christians to live their lives according to the teachings of Christ.</p>
      <p>He has also warned the youth in the church against smoking, excessive drinking of alcohol, abuse of tramadol and other negative acts that could hinder their efforts at winning souls for the kingdom of God.</p>
      <p>Rev. Obuor preached the sermon to climax a week-long evangelism crusade held by the Church at Akrowa in the Afigya Kwabre South District of the Ashanti Region.</p>
      <p>It was under the theme “Let Christ be formed in you” (Galatians 4:19).</p>
      <p>Rev. Obour appealed to members of the church to pray ahead of the 2020 elections and the upcoming district level elections in December to ensure peace in the country.</p>
      <p>He further urged the youth to commit themselves to hard work instead of relying on magicians to conjure money for them, saying, the desire to get money quick in devilish manner, was not only dangerous but also against the teachings of Christ.</p>
      <p>Mr Gyasi Danso, Unit Committee Chairman of the town, asked Christians to pray for the upcoming district level elections to ensure success.</p>
