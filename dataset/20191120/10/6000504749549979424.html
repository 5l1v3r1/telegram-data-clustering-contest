        <b>Oval Money is to provide its users with an in-app connection to startup funding via Seedrs, beginning with its own pitch for a £1 million crowdfund raise.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The money management app will enable Oval's 350,000 users to register, become authorised and invest in the campaign all directly from the app, without having to leave it once. The API will allow the funding round to run simultaneously in the Oval app and the Seedrs site. <br/><br/>Under the wider partnership with Seedrs, Oval users will be able to add early-stage private equity to their investment portfolios, alongside the other funds and investment vehicles that Oval offer.<br/><br/>Chief technology officer at Seedrs, Ricardo Brizido, says: “Our vision for Seedrs is to be a part of the wider fintech ecosystem, allowing investors to access this exciting asset class from anywhere, whether that’s their bank or their favourite fintech app. APIs like this one will play a crucial role in the integration of private marketplaces into more mainstream channels.”</p>
