      <p>Whether you are hosting a party or attending one, whether it's a wedding or a small get-together of friends, there is no denying that food is the epitome of gatherings. No matter how beautiful the dish might look, if it isn't delicious, all of it might go in vain. From simple finger foods like cheese balls to succulent nibbles such as tikkas, there are endless option to prepare. But for a non-vegetarian there might be nothing more pleasing than a bowl of heart-warming chicken curry packed with whole lot of spices and tanginess!</p>
      <p>While you might have had all the <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/recipe-butter-chicken-106717">butter chickens</a> and <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/recipe-kadhai-murg-98727">kadhai chickens</a> of the world, but here we have a delightful chicken dish that is not just delicious but super easy to prepare at home. Nimbu Hari Mirch ka Murgh is a quick and easy chicken dish that has aromatic flavours of a myriad of spices and chillies. It has fried chicken pieces sautéed with ginger-garlic paste, onion, curd,<a href="https://food.ndtv.com/recipe-lemon-pickle-828506"> lemon pickle</a> and a host of spices. This chicken curry is quite different from the other curries since it has an addition of lemon juice that brings tanginess to the chicken while the curd and cream gives a creamy and rich look to the dish. It is served with a generous garnishing of coriander leaves and green chillies.</p>
