      <p><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/squarepusher">Squarepusher</a> returns to <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=353">Warp</a> with a new album on January 31st. <br/><br/>Influenced by the DIY Essex rave scene of Tom Jenkinson's past, <i>Be Up A Hello</i> makes use of vintage analogue and digital hardware, in contrast to the cutting-edge software of 2015's <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/16848">Damogen Furies</a>. The music was "written in the mode of a diary," as each song was finalized and recorded in a single take. <br/><br/>"Whilst analogue sounds can be cliched," Jenkinson says, "if you look at the processes that generate them analytically, there are still ways you can create new sonic palates." <br/><br/>Ahead of the album, Squarepusher will release a two-track 12-inch, <i>Vortrack</i>, which features one remix. That's out on December 6th. <br/><br/>Over the past few years and outside of the Squarepusher moniker, Jenkinson formed the band Shobaleader One, which reinterpreted Squarepusher tracks, scored music for the BBC children's television channel CBeebies and collaborated with James McVinnie on the album <i>All Night Chroma</i>, a series of compositions recorded on the Royal Festival Hall organ. <br/><br/>Read our new Label Of The Month <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3557">feature</a> on Warp Records. <br/><br/>Listen to "Vortrack" and its "Fracture" remix.</p>
