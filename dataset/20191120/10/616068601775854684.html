      <p>Pembina Pipeline Corp. says the Canadian Competition Bureau has signed off on its $4.3-billion deal to buy assets from Kinder Morgan Inc.</p>
      <p>The Calgary-based company says the receipt of the "no-action letter" from the bureau clears the final regulatory hurdle for the deal to go through.</p>
      <p>Pembina announced in August that it would buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd. and the U.S. portion of the Cochin pipeline system.</p>
      <p>Along with the 110,000-barrel-a-day Cochin pipeline, which runs from Fort Saskatchewan, Alta. to Chicago, the deal also includes an Edmonton storage and terminal business and Vancouver Wharves, a bulk storage and export-import business.</p>
      <p>Kinder Morgan Canada was spun off from its American parent in mid-2017 to raise money to build the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion but it sold the pipeline and its expansion project to the federal government for $4.5 billion last summer.</p>
      <p>Pembina, which is offering shares worth $2.3 billion along with $2.05 billion in cash for the assets, expects the deal to close in December after a vote by shareholders.</p>
