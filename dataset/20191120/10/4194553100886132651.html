      <h1>(Video) Milner smashing goals with left-foot at Melwood in preparation for Crystal Palace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:44:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>James Milner could well be in the starting XI v Crystal Palace on Saturday, with Andy Robertson still not training with the first-team fully.</p>
      <p>The Scot missed the international break but the tie at Selhurst Park may come too soon.</p>
      <p>Milner is Robbo‚Äôs first-choice replacement, and should be fresh after having two weeks at Melwood while his first-team team-mates were away with their countries.</p>
      <p>And the club‚Äôs official Twitter account has uploaded this video of Milner smashing in a left-footed effort on the training ground!</p>
      <p>Every time we see Melwood footage, Milner always looks like the best player on the field -such is the commitment he puts in every day.</p>
      <p>We just hope he signs a contract extension soon!</p>
