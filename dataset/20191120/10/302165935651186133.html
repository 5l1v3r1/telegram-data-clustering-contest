      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 20 — Controversial Singapore actor and singer Aliff Aziz has been charged in a Singapore court on Monday with disorderly conduct.</p>
      <p>He is said to have acted indecently as well as gesturing inappropriate hand signals in a drunken state during the incident allegedly committed at 6.25am on November 10 at a public area near Orchard Towers, Orchard Road, Singapore.</p>
      <p>Singapore media Berita Mediacorp reported that if convicted, Aliff faces a possible fine of not more than S$2,000 (RM6,115) or jail term not more than six months or both.</p>
      <p>This is the third charge faced by the 28-year-old in less than three months.</p>
      <p>In September, he was slapped with criminal charges for allegedly stealing RM1,200 from Indonesian celebrity Raja Yunika Perdhana Putri.</p>
      <p>He was also accused of stealing a box of cigarettes and a lighter belonging to a man at Starbucks Plaza Singapore.</p>
      <p>According to the portal, Aliff was supposed to be present in court yesterday for the two earlier cases but due to the third charge, the cases had been postponed to a later date.</p>
      <p>It has been a bad year for Aliff whose marriage to Bella Astillah ended in divorce in May following a string of extramarital affairs.</p>
