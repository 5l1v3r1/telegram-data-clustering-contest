      <ul>
        <li>Anti-capitalists argue that current economic inequality shows that capitalism is “broken.” But this is a gross mischaracterization.</li>
        <li>As Alexander Green explains, no system provides more opportunities to build wealth and achieve success.</li>
        <li>How to claim a hardcover of <i>The United States of Trump</i>, FREE!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In his excellent new book <i>The United States of Trump</i>, my friend Bill O’Reilly explains why the president refuses to admit it when he’s wrong.</p>
      <p>The short answer is he views it as a sign of weakness.</p>
      <p>In any event, I don’t have that luxury. <a href="https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1408718"><b><u>I pick stocks for a living.</u></b></a></p>
      <p>When a recommendation goes south – as one will from time to time – it’s like backing over your neighbor’s mailbox while he’s standing in the driveway.</p>
      <p>It isn’t hard to determine who’s responsible.</p>
      <p>However, some business leaders today have the opposite problem.</p>
      <p>They are trying to create goodwill by apologizing for things they <i>didn’t</i> do wrong. Like generating profits for shareholders.</p>
      <p>A while back, the Business Roundtable – a group made up of the CEOs of 192 of the largest U.S. companies – made a strategic blunder when it issued this statement:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Americans deserve an economy that allows each person to succeed through hard work and creativity and to lead a life of meaning and dignity… We commit to deliver value to all of them, for the future success of our companies, our communities and our country.</i>
      </p>
      <p>We already have a system that allows everyone to succeed, provided they work, save and invest. And the economy is hardly broken (&gt;&gt;<a href="https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1408718"><b><u>PROOF HERE</u></b></a>&lt;&lt;).</p>
      <p>Unemployment is at a historic low. Household income is at a record high. So is household net worth.</p>
      <p>This is the continuation of a long-term trend. American prosperity has been on the rise for well over a century.</p>
      <p>No one talks about “the French dream” or “the Norwegian dream.”</p>
      <p>No other country is universally recognized as the land of opportunity. And no country attracts more students, more immigrants, or more foreign investment capital.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>It’s no coincidence that fantastic innovators like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, and countless others were all founded here.</p>
      <p>Our business leaders recognize that a company succeeds only if employees, suppliers, and customers are satisfied, not just shareholders.</p>
      <p>If you don’t agree, you’ve never run a business.</p>
      <p>Undercompensate or disrespect your employees, and they will take their talents elsewhere. Bargain too hard with your suppliers – or pay them late – and they won’t trade with you.</p>
      <p>As for customers, if they aren’t delighted – trust me – shareholders won’t be either.</p>
      <p>Yet – by acting as if these things weren’t already the case – members of the Business Roundtable created an “aha” moment for socialists and anti-capitalists to proclaim that “even the billionaires” know the free market system needs to be reformed.</p>
      <p>(And, indeed, a few actual billionaires, like Marc Benioff and Ray Dalio – who ardently want to sell their new books to the angry mob – may someday look back and wonder just what the heck they were thinking.)</p>
      <p>Capitalism is the greatest anti-poverty program of all time – and <a href="https://pro.oxfordclub.com/m/1408718"><b><u>the greatest creator of prosperity.</u></b></a></p>
      <p>Yes, government has a role to play too. Someone has to defend the shores, enforce contracts, and referee the game.</p>
      <p>But look around the world. Heavy-handed government does not lead to more prosperity.</p>
      <p>Anti-capitalists regularly describe our economic system as one based on greed, selfishness, and exploitation.</p>
      <p>That is a laughable mischaracterization.</p>
      <p>The free market says you can have anything you want if you provide enough other people with what <i>they</i> want.</p>
      <p>That’s how you get rich as a capitalist.</p>
      <p>By thinking not about your own wants and needs but about the wants and needs of others – and how to satisfy them better than anyone else.</p>
      <p>Companies that understand this – and can deliver on it – are the ones you want to own as an investor.</p>
      <p>Which ones are they?  Bill O’Reilly and I discussed just that important topic in our recent <b><u><a href="https://pro.oxfordclub.com/p/WEALTHTO99AGBBOOKOXFLT2YRDS786786LTBRK/POXFVB59/?h=true">Great American Wealth Project, already viewed by over 750,000 people.</a></u></b></p>
