      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a> has clapped back at Emily Atack’s dig and has threated to fly out to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! jungle to confront her.</p>
      <p>During Tuesday’s Extra Camp, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebs-emily-atack-makes-dig-katie-price-peter-andres-former-relationship-11182002/">the former Inbetweeners star threw shade at Katie and </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/peter-andre/">Peter Andre</a> by joking that presenters Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas needed to get tested for diseases after plunging into the same pool that the former couple first kissed in.</p>

      <p>‘This is where Katie Price and Peter Andre had fondles,’ Joel proudly boasted to his co-host. But back in the studio, Emily teased: ‘I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool.’</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Katie wasn’t best pleased by Emily’s comments and, according to reports, made it clear that the actress would have a ‘problem’ if she wanted one.</p>
      <p>An insider said: ‘Katie says she’s not watching the show, but when Emily Atack mentioned her on Extra Camp all her friends told her what she said.</p>

      <p>‘She was telling people that she can’t believe Emily would say something so snide and if she “wants a problem, I’ll give her a problem”.’</p>
      <p>They added to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10378563/katie-price-threatens-australia-extra-camp-stds/">The Sun</a>: ‘At one point Katie was saying she’d fly out to Australia and confront her. She’s not going to, obviously, but she was asking around to see if anyone had Emily’s number.</p>
