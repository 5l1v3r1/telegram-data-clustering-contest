      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:15:46+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:15</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Whether it’s Evil Kermit or Condescending Willy Wonka, it’s hard to go online these days without spotting at least a few memes.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> has quietly launched a new app that lets you create your own hilarious memes.</p>
      <p>The app, called Whale, has been created by Facebook’s New Product Experimentation (NPE) Team, which regularly launches experimental apps.</p>
      <p>On its App Store listing, it explains: “No distractions, no hidden subscription pricing. Use your own images or choose from our stock photo library and get creative with text, tools, effects, and more right inside the app.”</p>
      <p>To use the app, users must first pick a photo, whether it’s from their own camera roll or a stock image from within the app.</p>

      <p>They can then add text, images, emoji, filter or popular effects to transform the basic image into a personalised emoji.</p>
      <p>Finally, the meme can be saved and shared via social media.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it seems that Whale is currently only available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">Canadian App Store</a>, and it remains unclear when, or even if, it will launch worldwide.</p>
      <p>Facebook’s NPE Team was created back in July, and is tasked with creating apps focused on giving people entirely new experiences.</p>
      <p>Facebook explained: “This is a way for Facebook to develop new types of experiences for people and to try different ideas by creating small, focused apps in order to see whether people find certain features useful or engaging.</p>
      <p>“We may use what we learn to help inform our thinking and product strategy moving forward.”</p>
