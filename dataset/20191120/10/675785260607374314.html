      <h2>Prosecutors in the US say a false pregnancy rumour led to the murder of 14-year-old Sylvia McGee, from Canton, Ohio</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:24:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:24</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>A 13-year-old boy has admitted shooting dead a teen girl because he wrongly thought she was pregnant with his child.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors in the case said 14-year-old schoolgirl Sylvia McGee was shot dead a block away from her home in Canton, Ohio, following the spreading of a false pregnancy rumour.</p>
      <p>The teen boy believed Sylvia was pregnant with his child and allegedly shot her once in the head with a .38-celibre semi-automatic handgun in March, according to local reports.</p>
      <p>The gun used in the shooting has never been found.</p>
      <p>After his arrest, the teen claimed to have carried out the execution-style killing because he believed Sylvia was pregnant and he was the father of her child, reports the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10382284/girl-shot-dead-pregnant-boy-teenager/">The Sun</a>.</p>

      <p>Assistant prosecutor Michelle Cordova said an autopsy showed Sylvia was not pregnant, adding that she was not the defendant's girlfriend.</p>
      <p>She told a court the false pregnancy rumours had been behind the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Ms Cordova said: "That is what I believe got this whole thing started. There was no evidence of any other reason for this.”</p>
      <p>The now 14-year-old boy, who is being tried as a juvenile due to his age at the time of Sylvia's death, has reportedly accepted one count of murder, reduced from aggravated murder.</p>

      <p>He also pleaded guilty to obstructing justice by giving false and misleading information to police, as well as an accompanying gun specification.</p>
      <p>He must remain in youth prison until he is 21 years old.</p>
      <p>However, the teen could face longer in custody, as a sentencing judge in January will decide whether to sentence him as a serious youth offender, which could add 18 years' life imprisonment to his jail term.</p>

      <p>The killer received the youth sentence after a co-defendant, 14, admitted tapmering with evidence, obstructing justice and being an accomplice to murder.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor John Ferrero reportedly told the court the agreement was made to avoid putting Sylvia's family through a jury trial, and they had supported the decision in the "tragic" case.</p>
      <p>He said: "Our hands were tied. I just thought it was the worst of the worst cases I’ve seen here.</p>
      <p>Following the sentencing, one of Sylvia's family member said the teen had planned to move to New York to work as a beautician and dreamed of opening her own business one day.</p>
      <p>She said she had been the kind of girl who got along with everyone: "She didn't deserve that. She wasn't that type of a kid. She was upbeat and funny."</p>
