      <p>A pregnant woman was mauled to death after stumbling across a ‘threatening’ deer hunt involving 93 dogs in France.</p>
      <p>Elisa Pilaski, 29, had telephoned her husband when she was walking her own dogs in the Retz Forest, north of Paris, saying she felt ‘threatened’ by a hunt.</p>
      <p>The attack came shortly after the call, however there was no time for him to help and he later found her body in the woods.</p>
      <p>Local prosecutor Frederic Trinh confirmed her cause of death as ‘bleeding after several dog bites to the upper and lower limbs and the head.’</p>
      <p>Mrs Pilaski was found mauled to death and a criminal investigation for manslaughter was launched by the prosecutor and judicial police.</p>
      <p>Forensic tests have been carried out on 93 dogs connected with the incident, to try and work out which ones had attacked her.</p>
      <p>However, France’s Hunting Association has rejected claims the hunting dogs are the perpetrators of this horrifying attack.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>They said: “Nothing reveals the involvement of hunting hounds in the death of this woman”.</p>
      <p>It said there were around 30,000 hunting hounds in France and “these dogs are trained to hunt a particular animal and to obey man in all circumstances”.</p>
      <p>But Brigitte Bardot, the retired movie actress turned animal rights campaigner, called on the government to ‘suspend all hunt authorisation for this season’.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a retired carpenter was blasted to death by a hunter who ‘mistook him for game’ in the French countryside.</p>
      <p>Franck Jarry, 77, became another lethal statistic of the controversial shooting season last Friday.</p>
      <p>He was out picking mushrooms close to the hamlet of Villars-les-Bois, in the western Charente-Maritime department, when the accident happened.</p>
      <p>‘A 34-year-old hunter saw movement in the undergrowth and thought it was game,’ said an investigating source.</p>
      <p>‘A dog was barking, and this seemed to confirm the presence of animals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>‘After realising that he had shot a man, the hunter immediately went to the victim's aid, and called the emergency services, but it was too late.’</p>
      <p>Last year a 22-year-old British mountain biker was shot dead by a hunter in thick woods near the village of Montriond, in eastern France.</p>
      <p>This was despite Marc Sutton – a restaurateur who originally came from Caerphilly, South Wales – wearing bright clothing and a helmet that made him easily identifiable.</p>
      <p>There are around 1.2 million hunters in France, with some 37,000 new gun licences obtained each year.</p>
      <p>But many people drop out of the administrative process because of the length of time it takes, and the cost, which is the equivalent of more than £400 for a permit.</p>
      <p>France’s hunting season only started in September, but there have already been three deaths so far.</p>
      <p>During the 2017/18 season, there were 113 serious accidents, with 13 people killed.</p>
