      <h1>Angry Birds-Themed ‘Venting Machine’ Encourages Users to #BringTheAnger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:45:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>The only currency you need for this vending machine is anger.</p>
      <p>For one day only, folks are invited to kick, punch, or scream at <a href="http://www.rovio.com/news/angry-birds-10th-anniversary-bringtheanger-campaign-continues-reveal-venting-machine">Rovio Entertainment’s “Venting Machine”</a> to win special prizes*.</p>
      <p>As the Finnish game maker counts down to the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/augmented-reality-angry-birds-and-apples-other-iphone-gaming-plans-1778223/"><i>Angry Birds</i> </a>(on Dec. 11), its #BringTheAnger campaign aims to demonstrate how outrage can be used for good.</p>
      <p>Hot off the wheels of its <a href="https://www.rovio.com/news/angry-birds-10th-anniversary-campaign-encourages-fans-bringtheanger-positive-force-good">fury-powered Rage Rider scooter</a>, Rovio is set to unveil the Angry Birds Venting Machine this week in one of the world’s most infamously infuriating places: New York City’s Times Square.</p>
      <p>From noon to 8 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 21, passersby can release their resentments at the corner of 45th Street and Broadway.</p>
      <p>Alongside WWE star Big Show—on deck to demonstrate the “unique properties” of the Venting Machine—YouTube creators <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4mLlRa_dezwvytudo9s1sw">Deestroying</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaRH3rDr3K3CEfhVqu5mgUQ">Team Edge</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-O9o5coq8iFSVthivq__tw">Lexi Hensler</a>, as well as more than 25 social media influencers, will join the unveiling.</p>
      <p>It’s still unclear exactly how Rovio plans to spread the campaign’s message of positive change. Frankly, this all sounds like a bit of fun and games. (And a great way to avoid paying for <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/watch-angry-kangaroo-punches-paraglider-after-he-lands-on-its-turf-1777953/">anger</a> management classes.)</p>

      <p>Can’t make it to Times Square? (Or just don’t want to risk the panic attack?)</p>
      <p>Rovio teamed up with partner UNICEF Finland for a #BringTheAnger in-game event encouraging <i>Angry Birds 2</i> players to pop as many pigs as they can throughout November.</p>
      <p>Once 10 billion sows are sacrificed, the competition will culminate in a $100,000 donation to UNICEF’s Education in Emergencies fund, which supports education for children in conflict zones and other emergencies across the globe.</p>
      <p>You don’t have to donate any money to participate (though I’m sure the agency wouldn’t mind the gift).</p>
      <p>The Venting Machine, brought to life through Brooklyn-based 10XBeta, is just one of many activations and events rolling out through December to celebrate a decade of flinging animated birds at enemy swine.</p>
      <p>Fans can follow the #BringTheAnger campaign on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/angrybirds">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angrybirds/">Instagram</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/angrybirds">Twitter</a> throughout the 10th anniversary celebrations. Or visit <a href="https://www.angrybirds.com/bring-the-anger">angrybirds.com/bring-the-anger</a>.</p>
      <p>* Nowhere does Rovio even hint at what that bounty might be</p>
