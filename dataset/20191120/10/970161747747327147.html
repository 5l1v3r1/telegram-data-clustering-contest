      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s mum has lashed out at the Kardashians and Kris Jenner, claiming her daughter was made to look spineless by her family.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old is currently winning new fans on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here!, making friends with campmates including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts, Ian Wright and James Haskell.</p>
      <p>But when it comes to the stars of Caitlyn’s other big reality show, her mother Esther isn’t so keen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/celebrity/article-7705379/Caitlyn-Jenners-mother-doesnt-Kardashians-hit.html">Esther, 93, told the Mail Online:</a> ‘[Kris] made [Caitlyn] look like a milquetoast man!’ – milquetoast meaning spineless and unassertive.</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘I wasn’t fond of that programme [Keeping Up With The Kardashians], there was no plot, and why it was such a hit I’ll never know, and I guess it still is.’</p>

      <p>Caitlyn – who had daughters Kylie and Kendall with wife of 24 years Kris – starred on the reality show from 2007, and while she doesn’t star all the time alongside her ex-wife, daughters and stepchildren Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob, the former Olympian continues to have cameos.</p>
      <p>The star went on to have her own E! series, I Am Cait, which Esther appeared on – but when it comes to I’m A Celeb, Caitlyn’s mum won’t be tuning in.</p>
      <p>Esther said: ”That’s not entertainment to me, to see somebody frightened. I think she could spend a lot more pleasant times on the golf course!</p>

      <p>‘I have no idea [why she’s doing this]. I don’t ask her questions to get into her mind or how she feels about this or that. My big worry is [she may] get bitten by a snake or a poisonous insect.’</p>
      <p>On last night’s edition of I’m A Celeb, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-begins-spilling-family-secrets-opens-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-11185599/">Caitlyn began to spill the tea on her famous family in a chat with Adele Roberts.</a></p>
      <p>Talking about how Kim got the business bug, Caitlyn recalled: ‘Kimberly never went to college. The minute she left high school she started businesses. She had her first business out of the closet.</p>

      <p>‘Kimberly would go into the ladies’ closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet – they’re huge. Beverly Hills ladies.</p>
      <p>‘They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberly has an eBay site… Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission.’</p>
      <p>And speaking about son-in-law Kanye West, the athlete added: ‘I like Kanye. Kanye was very, very good to me.’</p>
