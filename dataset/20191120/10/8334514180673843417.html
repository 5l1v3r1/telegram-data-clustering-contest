      <p>(Reuters) - Russian 400m runner Artyom Denmukhametov’s suspension for working with banned coach Vladimir Kazarin has been lifted by the IAAF global athletics body, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) said.</p>
      <p>Denmukhametov was charged and provisionally suspended in June for working with Kazarin, who was banned for life after a 2015 report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found he had given athletes banned performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
      <p>“The IAAF disciplinary tribunal has dismissed charges of prohibited association against Russian athlete Artyom Denmukhametov,” the AIU said on Twitter on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“As a consequence, the provisional suspension of the athlete is lifted.”</p>
      <p>WADA rules stipulate that athletes are not allowed to receive training, strategy, nutritional or medical advice from coaches or medical staff serving doping bans and face sanctions if they do.</p>
      <p>The provisional suspension barred Denmukhametov from participating in any competition or activity in athletics pending a final decision at a hearing conducted under IAAF Anti-Doping Rules or the Integrity Code of Conduct.</p>
      <p>The AIU, which oversees integrity issues in international athletics, including doping, added in its Twitter post that Denmukhametov had exercised his right under the World Anti-Doping Code for the ruling details not to be published.</p>
      <p>Russia’s athletics federation has been suspended since a 2015 WADA-commissioned report found evidence of mass doping in the sport.</p>
      <p>But some Russian athletes, including two-time world champion high jumper Maria Lasitskene, have been cleared by the IAAF to compete internationally after demonstrating that they are training in a doping-free environment.</p>
