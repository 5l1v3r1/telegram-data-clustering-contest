      <h1>James Milner jokes Liverpool are having VAR training ahead of Crystal Palace clash</h1>
      <h2>VAR has had an influence over most teams this season with Liverpool no exception and James Milner has mocked the system as the Reds work on their offsides</h2>

      <p>James Milner has mocked VAR after claiming Liverpool were training to combat the newly installed system.</p>
      <p>The Reds have endured a mixed bag when it comes to VAR decisions, but the 33-year-old midfielder joked that the Premier League leaders were finding ways to beat it.</p>
      <p>"Practised VAR offsides today, Hendo was off by a glove here," Milner said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>The former Leeds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star is known for his dry sense of humour and lived up to his billing on social media.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were denied a goal at Aston Villa earlier this month when Roberto Firmino's armpit was judged to be offside.</p>

      <p>Sadio Mane was also found to have handled the ball in a tight call which denied him a goal at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>But the Senegalese star did win a contentious penalty when Liverpool secured a late win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>VAR's introduction has divided opinion among those in the game with Milner backing the traditional approach that doesn't hinder the fan's experience.</p>
      <p>"It might just be the old school part of me but I think there’s still too much debate around VAR," he told the Guardian earlier this season.</p>
      <p>"Goal-line technology is incredible. Instant decision. Black and white. But it’s very hard to use VAR when you’ve still got opinions on the decisions and the atmosphere is being ruined. You score, there’s an explosion of noise and then it’s VAR. You wait. Is it a goal?</p>
      <p>"I had the experience of a penalty the other week [against Leicester in stoppage time]. That was a new experience as they’re debating if it’s going to be a penalty.</p>
      <p>"I think there’s use for it – if we can improve it. But football is a game of human error on the field and in officiating as well. They have a very tough job and I’m all for making their lives easier – but not at the expense of the flow of the game.</p>
      <p>"If the VAR took away controversy I’d back it 100%. But we’re still having discussions about VAR. I don’t think many footballers feel differently."</p>
