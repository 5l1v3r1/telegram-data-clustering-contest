      <h1>Russia Condemns Israel’s Air Strikes in Syria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:49:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/di/" target="_blank">David Israel</a></address>
      <p>Russia’s special representative for the Middle East and Africa, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov, said on Wednesday that his country regards the Israeli air strikes on Syrian territory as “very wrong,” TASS reported.</p>
      <p>“We will look into the circumstances. All this is very wrong,” he said. “It merely causes an unnecessary escalation of tensions.”</p>
      <p>Reports on Wednesday said that while devastating several ground-to-air missile batteries, Israel did not damage the Syrian army’s advanced SS-300 battery, which is operated by Russian soldiers (See: <a href="https://www.jewishpress.com/news/middle-east/syria/idf-attacks-dozens-of-iranian-quds-syrian-army-targets-in-retaliation-for-rockets/2019/11/20/">IDF Attacks Dozens of Iranian Quds, Syrian Army Targets in Retaliation for Rockets</a>).</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Bogdanov attended a meeting in Moscow between Secretary of the Russian Security Council Nikolai Patrushev and Israeli National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat. The meeting reportedly dealt specifically with the Iranian presence in Syria.</p>
