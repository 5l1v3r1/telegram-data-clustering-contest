      <p>The South Okanagan Similkameen Medical Foundation is hoping to raise $925,000 this holiday season through their Tree of Dreams fundraiser, money that will go toward equipment for procedures including hip surgeries. </p>
      <p>Dr. Tim Bell is one of two PRH surgeons who perform anterior hip surgery which results in a much faster recovery period.  No ligaments or tendons are cut and a key muscle is simply moved aside, but the procedure does requires a specialized table to align the hip.</p>
      <p>"Anterior hip surgery allows for patients to go home the same day or within 24 hours,” Bell said. “Here in Penticton about 70 per cent of our patients go home the same day.”</p>
      <p>The money raised will also go to a new mammography machine, electro-encephalogram unit and colonoscopy scopes. </p>
      <p>"We gained a fantastic response from donors to our $20-million Tower campaign,” said Carey Bornn, executive director of SOS Medical Foundation. “Now we’re looking for support for other key items to make sure we continue offering the best health care available for residents throughout our region.”</p>
      <p>A Tree of Dreams brochure has been mailed out to area households.  This year, a separate campaign was launched for residents in Oliver and Osoyoos to donate towards an upgrade of South Okanagan General Hospital.</p>
