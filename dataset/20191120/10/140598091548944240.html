      <h1>The best Dyson Black Friday and Cyber Monday deal predictions for 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:56:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-russell/" target="_blank">Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>Dyson has a knack for designing home products we all want - whether that be a cordless vacuum cleaner, air purifier or smart hair styler. But such products often come at a premium cost - which is why we can't wait to see the Dyson deals for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday 2019</a>.</p>
      <p>The annual <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">sales event</a>, which takes place on November 29 this year, often sees Dyson products offered at a substantial discount. </p>
      <p>If previous years are anything to go by, retailers such as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/argos-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-toys-smart-home/">Argos</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/currys-pc-world-black-friday-deals-best-predictions-2019-sale/">Currys PC World</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-uk-today-early-sale-offers/">Amazon </a>and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/john-lewis-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-headphones/">John Lewis</a> will all stock Dyson products at a lower price this Black Friday.</p>
      <p>However, it can be worth ordering directly from Dyson. Not only will you benefit from their price-match promise (including any deals offered from competitors within seven days of your purchase), but there is also a 35-day money back guarantee and the option to pay monthly.</p>
      <p>Last year, there were particularly impressive deals on cordless vacuum cleaners and dual fan heaters - although we predict a shift to haircare this year. Analysing last year's sales and this year's product trends, the following are our predictions of the Dyson deals for Black Friday 2019.</p>
      <h3>Dyson Black Friday predictions for 2019</h3>
      <h4>Handheld and cordless vacuum cleaner deals</h4>
      <p>The super-powerful handheld Dyson V6 Trigger vacuum was heavily discounted in 2017, when many retailers offered the model at less than £100 for Black Friday. Now, the model has been replaced on most shelves by the V7 Trigger vacuum - currently retailing at £199.99 on the Dyson website. With such a steep cost for a year-old model, we predict a slight reduction during this year's sales.</p>
      <p>As for the cordless vacuum cleaners that Dyson is best known for, there were some impressive (and surprising) offers last year. The V7 Motorhead Cordless Bagless Vacuum Cleaner was on offer, coming with a handheld toolkit bundle. Plus, the newer V8 Absolute Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (ideal if you've got pets) was also in the Black Friday sales. This year, we predict significant reductions on both the V7 and V8, as well as discounts on the Cyclone V10 - because with the advent of the V11, this model is now last year's news. </p>
      <h4>Upright and corded vacuum cleaner deals</h4>
      <p>During last year's Black Friday sales, Dyson's Light Ball Animal Upright Bagless Vacuum Cleaner (which only weighs 6.9kg) had some impressive discounts. This year, we predict further reductions on the Light Ball, as well as a slight discount on the Ball Animal 2 vacuum (which uses the same iconic Ball technology but is built for deep cleaning and pet hair suction.) </p>
      <p>Dyson's cylinder vacuums are also a worthy investment, because they are compact, adaptable and spring back up when they topple over. This year, we predict the Dyson Big Ball Multi Floor 2 cylinder vacuum will be in the Black Friday sales, because it is the slightly less impressive version of the Dyson Big Ball Animal 2 vacuum (The Multi Floor 2 doesn't come with a turbine head - which picks up ground-in dirt). </p>
      <h4>Hair dryer and styler deals</h4>
      <p>The Dyson <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/hair/will-this-dyson-hairdryer-change-your-life/">SuperSonic hairdryer</a> is at the top of most beauty wish lists - and for good reason. This lightweight hairdryer self-regulates its temperature, minimising heat damage to your hair at the same time as giving you an effective blow-dry look. And those who are always in a rush to get ready in the morning will be pleased to hear it dries hair ten times faster than other popular models. </p>

      <p>But will the SuperSonic make it into this year's Black Friday sales? Potentially - last year the hairdryer had an ever-so-slight reduction on Amazon. Maybe we should expect slightly more than £20 knocked off the retailing price this year (fingers crossed, anyway).</p>
      <p>We also predict that the Dyson AirWrap Styler will have a mini discount. The styler has received stellar reviews (including <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/hair/5-best-hair-curlers-long-lasting-curls-tried-tested-telegraph/">from The Telegraph</a>) and its current retailing at £449.99. </p>
      <h4>Fan and air purifier deals</h4>
      <p>For those moments when even the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/interiors/home/best-portable-air-conditioners/">best portable air conditioner</a> won't cut it, Dyson is at hand with its Hot + Cool fan heater. Not only does it have the ability to warm up a room, using Dyson's unique Air Multiplier™ technology, but the Hot + Cool fan heater can also cool you down at your desk.</p>
      <p>Last year, the AM09 Hot + Cool fan heater was in the sales, and we predict it will be heavily discounted again this year. We predict the same for the Dyson Pure Cool Link purifier, as both are slightly older models. </p>
      <p>However, we also expect a slight reduction on the newer Dyson Pure Hot + Cool, released in February this year, because this is currently retailing at the aspirational price of £549. While we don't think there will be a huge discount on such a new product, we reckon there will still be a saving to be made.</p>
