      <p>A major cash boost to deliver broadband improvements in rural areas of Teignbridge will continue to be provided.</p>
      <p>Teignbridge District Council on Tuesday agreed that their £250,000 contribution towards the Connecting Devon and Somerset superfast broadband rollout should be maintained.</p>
      <p>The cash is match funded, so a total of £500,000 will go towards the rollout, although it won’t be until the 2022/23 financial year at the earliest.</p>
      <p>The CDS Phase 2 programme is focused on addressing the 10 per cent of rural areas that won’t be commercially covered by superfast broadband rollout to help provide affordable solutions.</p>

      <p>The council’s overview and scrutiny committee last month recommended that the £250,000 contribution towards the Connecting Devon and Somerset superfast broadband rollout should be withdrawn, but the executive, and subsequently full council, voted that subject to satisfactory assurances about the investment in rural broadband achieving enhanced provision and support in Teignbridge, they should continue to invest the money.</p>
      <p>Cllr Alan Connett, portfolio holder for corporate services????, told the meeting at Forde House that yesterday they received a letter from CDS saying that they would amend their program so it will show the baseline in the budget and the additional advantages to Teignbridge of the £250,000 that they have committed.</p>
      <p>Cllr Stephen Purser, who represents the Teign Valley ward, said that he was gratified by the recommendation. He added: “I was concerned the Teign Valley would suffer it this money wasn’t made available, but I am pleased to see these assurances.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Charles Nuttall, Teignbridge’s representative on the CDS board, added: “I want to ensure the money directly and provably benefits residents of the district.”</p>

      <p>The council agreed that to delegated to the Managing Director, in consultation with the Leader of the Council, to conclude an agreement.</p>
      <p>But Cllr Adrian Patch said that it should include a ‘get-out’ clause depending on the result of the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>Referring to Labour’s free broadband policy, he said: “We may have a government that funds free broadband for everyone, so perhaps we should have a get out clause in place so if they are in power, we don’t have to fund this money.”</p>
