      <h2>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has injury concerns over several of his Manchester United stars as they prepare for the trip to Bramall Lane to face the high-flying Blades</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:28:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United have issued updates on six of their injured stars ahead of their trip to Sheffield United in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Axel Tuanzebe could bolster the backline as he recovers form a hip problem sustained in the warm-up prior to the 1-1 draw against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on October 20.</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay is set to remain sidelined after being replaced in United's last outing - a 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>McTominay has been absent from Scotland's internationals against Cyrpus and Afghanistan and is struggling to make the fixture at Bramall Lane.</p>
      <p>Luke Shaw and Nemanja Matic could both come back into Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's thinking as they battle back from their respective problems.</p>

      <p>Solskjaer will provide a further update on the duo when he speaks to the press on Friday.</p>
      <p>Diogo Dalot is hopeful of being available soon but Sunday may come to quick for the defender, while Paul Pogba is continuing his recovery but will not be available until December.</p>
      <p>Ashley Young is back available after serving a suspension.</p>
      <p>The Blades, meanwhile, will have to call on their goalkeeping reserves as on-loan Red Devils shot-stopper Dean Henderson is ineligible to face his parent club.</p>
      <p>Simon Moore and Michael Verrips will battle for the place between the sticks for Chris Wilder's men.</p>
      <p>Defender John Egan limped out of Ireland's Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark and faces a race against time to be fit to face the Old Trafford side.</p>
