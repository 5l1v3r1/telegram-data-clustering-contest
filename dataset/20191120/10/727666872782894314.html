      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Dave East needed to get some things off his chest. There were rumors circulating that his <i>Survival </i>album sold less than 3000 units in its first week of release.</p>
      <p>When the official numbers came back, East saw his debut studio album pull in around 22,000 units to open at #11 on the Billboard 200 chart. The Harlem-bred emcee took to Instagram to call out media outlets that pushed the "poor sales" narrative.</p>
      <p>The <i>Wu-Tang: An American Saga</i> actor wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Thanks To The Real. All The Fake Blogs And Fake Projections The Frank Stand Is Open 24 Hours A Day And Please Never Reach Out For Another Interview Or Anything Involving Dave East. Iâ€™m Cool. Shouts To <a href="https://www.instagram.com/billboard/">@billboard</a> For The Facts...</blockquote>
