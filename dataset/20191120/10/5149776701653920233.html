      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>’s City Ground redevelopment project “is very much a stadium-wide exercise”.</p>
      <p>And that could also include looking at how to improve the drainage from the pitch.</p>
      <p>A planning application is expected to be submitted before the end of the year, with work to transform the club’s home into a world-class venue hoped to get underway in 2020.</p>
      <p>Phase one will see <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3552378">the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt</a> to cater for an increased capacity of 10,000 fans, as well as accommodate new facilities such as a museum and club shop.</p>
      <p>Improvements will also be made to the other three sides of the ground, with the Bridgford Stand also extended.</p>
      <p>The Reds saw their <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/forest-reading-match-postponed-live-3465008">Championship clash with Reading postponed</a> last month due to a waterlogged pitch.</p>

      <p>And asked if modifications to the playing surface could be part of the redevelopment plans, Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy - the architectural firm behind the project - said: “The stadium in its entirety is part of the bigger conversation.</p>
      <p>“When we announced the plans earlier this year, we made it very clear that while <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3540790">the Peter Taylor Stand</a> was the most visible impact, the club are very aware of some of the challenges in the other stands and some of the issues like drainage.</p>
      <p>“Our brief, whilst not the pitch, is helping to understand how we can enhance the facilities in those other three stands.</p>
      <p>“As we know, those stands have been built for - in the case of the Brian Clough Stand and particularly the lower tier - many, many years.</p>
      <p>“They weren’t set out then, perhaps, to be accommodating the football in 2020.</p>
      <p>“The brief from the owner (<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a>) is very much a stadium-wide exercise, but this (the Peter Taylor Stand) is probably the bit that sets the ambition there and says, ‘this is what we’re prepared to pay and look to do on our infrastructure to give us the right facilities’.”</p>
