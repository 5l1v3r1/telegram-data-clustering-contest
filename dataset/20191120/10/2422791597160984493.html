      <p>A Hollywood studio executive once suggested that Julia Roberts should play iconic African-American activist Harriet Tubman in a biopic.</p>
      <p>In a<a href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/interview_screenwriter_gregory-allen-howard"> recent Q&amp;A, </a>screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard opened up about the 26-year journey to getting the "Harriet" biopic to the big screen.</p>
      <p>At the time the effort started, he said, Hollywood was not the same.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to turn Harriet Tubman's life, which I'd studied in college, into an action-adventure movie. The climate in Hollywood, however, was very different back then," Howard said. "I was told how one studio head said in a meeting, 'This script is fantastic. Let's get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman.'"</p>
      <p>Howard said when someone suggested Roberts could not play the role, the executive responded, "It was so long ago. No one is going to know the difference.'"</p>
      <p>British actress Cynthia Erivo got the role of the legendary abolitionist and freedom fighter in "Harriet," which is in theaters now.</p>
      <p>The casting of a British actress in the role of an African-American slave who led others to freedom <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/entertainment/harriet-controversies-box-office/index.html">was also criticized. </a>The cast also includes Janelle Monáe, Leslie Odom Jr., Jennifer Nettles, Joe Alwyn and Clarke Peters.</p>
      <p>The screenwriter said he's always thought <a href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/interview_screenwriter_gregory-allen-howard">Tubman's story was extraordinary.</a></p>
      <p>"Harriet was bigger than life. Harriet freeing slaves had a multiplying effect ... Harriet showed them how powerful they could become," Howard said.</p>
      <p>Tubman escaped from slavery and helped hundreds of slaves find freedom during the US Civil War era through the Underground Railroad, changing the course of American history.</p>
