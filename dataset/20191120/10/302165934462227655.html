      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 20 — Weak market sentiment on the back of bleak prospects for a US-China trade deal has dragged Bursa Malaysia to close lower today, with the key index retreating from its two-day winning streak.</p>
      <p>At 5pm, the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) lost 4.17 points to finish at 1,601.14 from 1,605.31 at close yesterday. It opened 3.89 points weaker at 1,601.42 in early trade.</p>
      <p>The barometer index moved in choppy trading and went down to a low of 1,598.32 earlier in the day on selling in heavyweights, making the FBM KLCI fragile and struggling to stay above the 1,600 level.</p>
      <p>The composite index was mainly dragged down by losses in Petronas Chemicals which contributed 2.123 points. The oil and gas stock fell 15 sen to RM7.21 with 4.96 million shares changing hands.</p>
      <p>However, on the broader market, gainers outnumbered losers 426 to 411, while 409 counters were unchanged, 762 untraded and 16 others suspended.</p>
      <p>Volume increased to 2.90 billion shares worth RM1.98 billion from 2.68 billion shares worth RM1.63 billion yesterday.</p>
      <p>Phillip Capital Management senior vice president (investment) Datuk Nazri Khan Adam Khan said the trade talks should bring on euphoria and a definite conclusion to the market despite the development from the US-China talks remaining fluid.</p>
      <p>“Although many investors remain cautious, pending more concrete evidence to surface, we stay positive and welcome any events as both parties are close to signing the deal.</p>
      <p>“As such, we reckon on the local bourse, there will be some buying activities on the strong fundamental sectors, but the benchmark FBM KLCI should see some headwinds at the current level as the markets are susceptible to the slightest of negative news flow,” he told Bernama.</p>
      <p>Asian markets tumbled as sentiment was weighed by US-China trade talks after President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on Chinese goods if Beijing refuses to agree to a deal.</p>
