      <h3>The Casiotone is back! New portable keyboards for beginners released</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Popular with families and used by countless garage bands who couldn’t afford anything else, the Casiotone range of portable keyboards was a fixture in the early ‘80s. Now Casio has released a revamped line-up of Casiotone models for the next generation of players.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In many ways, the CT-S200, CT-S300 and LK-S250 are cut from similar cloth to their predecessors, with each offering a wide range of built-in sounds and rhythms (400 and 122 respectively), plus 50 patterns in Dance Music Mode. You also get USB MIDI and a rechargeable battery.</p>
      <p>Thanks to slimline chassis’, weight has been kept down to six pounds, and there are 61 full-size keys. Portability is aided by the inclusion of a carry handle.</p>
      <p>Announced at Summer NAMM, the Casiotones are in stores now, all ready to find their way under Christmas trees. Prices are $109 for the CT-S200, $139 for the CT-S300, and $159 for the LK-S250.</p>
