      <h1>Nottingham bar is named one of the best in the UK</h1>
      <h2>The Hockley hideaway's cocktails are 'fab-u-lous'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:22:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:22</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>A Nottingham bar has been named as one of the UK's Best Cocktail Bars in an annual rundown of the top boozy hangouts by leading hen party organiser GoHen.</p>
      <p>The Hockley Arts Club was described as "the best looking bar with cocktails on another level. If it's not the vodka and strawberry cocktail topped with a Twister lollipop that's posted on Instagram, it's the pretty pink blossom trees in the Electric Garden bar."</p>
      <p>The three bars, each with a very different vibe, are hidden away from the bustling street in a grade II listed building, accessed via an alleyway in Carlton Street.</p>
      <p>The top 40 bars were selected by GoHen based upon the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/notts-bar-launches-advent-calendar-3548717">cocktails</a>, atmosphere, service and all-round experience.</p>

      <p>It is one of five<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/drivers-can-free-drink-nottingham-3537030"> bars</a> in the Midlands featured. GoHen said: "If there was an award for the coolest looking cocktail bar this would win it, no question. Actually, we’ve just invented the award and a big congratulations to the Hockley Arts Club for winning the inaugural Best Looking Cocktail Bar Award.</p>
      <p>"As well as being an amazing place to just exist, their cocktails are also on another level. Fab-u-lous!"</p>

      <p>The bar's other creative cocktails include Aspen Sour, an après-ski style drink made from Irish whiskey, chambord and spiced honey, and Scarlet Harlot, a seductive vodka and Amaretto number straight out of a 1940s film noir.</p>
      <p>Afternoon tea is something else as well, with a peached ice cocktail and bottomless prosecco.</p>
