      <h1>Elderly mother finds siblings dead at Brisbane home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:13:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Police are investigating a possible murder-suicide after the bodies of two siblings aged in their 50s were found by their frail, elderly mother in separate bedrooms at their Brisbane home.</p>
      <p>Police say the 54-year-old man and a 58-year-old woman might have been dead for some time before their bodies were discovered by their 89-year-old mother, who lived at the same address.</p>
      <p>Detectives found the siblings’ bodies in separate bedrooms at a home in Macbeth Place at Sunnybank Hills just after 2.30pm on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The elderly mother managed to alert neighbours, who called the police.</p>
      <p>Police said there were no obvious signs of death, and that autopsies and further forensic examinations would be conducted.</p>
      <p>They said it was too early to determine whether it was a murder-suicide, but that mental health issues would form part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>The siblings’ mother has been taken to hospital for assessment.</p>
