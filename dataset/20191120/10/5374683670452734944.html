      <h1>Holocaust survivor hugs 93-year-old Nazi guard during trial</h1>
      <h2>“Watch out everyone, I’m going to forgive him," says Holocaust survivor during trial in Germany for concentration camp guard.</h2>

      <p>A child survivor of the Holocaust interrupted the trial of a former Nazi concentration camp guard to give the 93-year-old defendant a hug.</p>
      <p>Bruno Dey is charged as an accessory in the murders of 5,230 people at the Stutthof concentration camp near what is today Gdansk, Poland. He is standing trial in Hamburg.</p>
      <p>Moshe Peter Loth, 76, a co-plaintiff in the case, approached Dev during the trial last week and said, “Watch out everyone, I’m going to forgive him.”</p>
      <p>Loth then hugged Dey. Loth said later that both men cried.</p>
      <p>In testimony at the trial, Loth said that his mother had been deported to Stutthof and that he was born there — a fact he reportedly learned only recently. After the camp’s liberation, Loth spent years with a Polish family and was later reunited with his family in Germany. They later immigrated to the United States.</p>
      <p>Loth said a lifetime of abuse and hardship made him “full of hate, until I recognized that I had to forgive.”</p>
      <p>Dey, a guard at the camp between August 1944 and April 1945, is being tried in a youth court because he was a teenager at the time.</p>
      <p>The court allowed Loth to question Dey, who repeated his testimony that he had not volunteered for duty in Stutthof and that he was shocked by what had happened there.</p>
      <p>According to an interpreter, Loth asked Dey’s forgiveness for having been angry and filled with hate.</p>
      <p>The defendant replied: “Absolutely. I have no hate.”</p>
      <p>Dey later said it was a relief for him to meet and apologize to Loth.</p>
      <p>In 2015, a similar event unfolded in a German courtroom when Auschwitz survivor Eva Kor publicly forgave former camp guard Oskar Groening. Kor, a Romanian-born U.S. citizen who died in July at 85, urged Groening to set an example by publicly denouncing neo-Nazi activity.</p>
