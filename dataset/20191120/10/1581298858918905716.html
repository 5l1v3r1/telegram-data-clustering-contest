      <p>A grassroots support organisation have secured funding to launch a statewide program to strengthen local communities in Esperance.</p>
      <p>Thanks to funding from The Department of Communities, Escare will spearhead the Empowering Communities Program for the next five years.</p>
      <p>Escare has been a trusted organisation providing financial assistance, advocacy, youth programs and workshops to families and individuals for more than 35 years.</p>
      <p>Escare development officer Natalie Symonds said the group looked forward to helping locals explore new activities, social interactions and shareable community opportunities.</p>
      <p>"The new program strives to empower the people of Esperance to be a connected and inclusive place where people feel they belong, are valued and contribute," she said.</p>
      <p>"The idea around the program is that the community know what they want and what they need.</p>
      <p>"They have the ideas and inspiration, and we support them to achieve whatever it is they want, it's really about action being community led.</p>
      <p>"It could be something as simple as a mum wanting to organise a playgroup in the park, so we would support them and give them the skills to be able to keep it going."</p>
      <p>One group that has benefited from the program is the Aboriginal women's learning group, Yorga Barmah.</p>
      <p>With the assistance of Escare in partnership with Esperance Community Arts, local woman created a space to share experiences, gain new skills and collaborate.</p>
      <p>Ms Symonds said the program aimed to overcome loneliness and reduce barriers to finding connection, such as by providing transport or childcare.</p>
      <p>"It is about including everyone, it is about breaking down barriers, about finding those skills in people that they might not think they have," she said.</p>
      <p>"Everyone's got something to give, we want people to feel important in their community, no matter what that community looks like."</p>
      <p>"There is a lot of good in our community. We want to recognise, appreciate and connect people to this good."</p>
      <p>Ms Symonds said anyone with project ideas they would like to explore is encouraged to contact Escare.</p>
