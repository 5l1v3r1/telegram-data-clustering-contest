      <p>BRUSSELS -- NATO foreign ministers are gathering in Brussels to prepare a leaders' summit in two weeks amid tensions over French President Emmanuel Macron's <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead">complaints about the "brain death" of the alliance</a>.</p>
      <p>France says it's concerned about a lack of U.S. leadership at NATO, the unpredictability of Turkey after its invasion of northern Syria and the need for Europe to take on more security responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Wednesday's meeting at NATO headquarters is aimed at finalizing the "summit deliverables;" the results will be announced at the Dec. 3-4 leaders' gathering near London.</p>
      <p>The ministers will endorse a confidential report laying out NATO's new policy toward China. They will announce space as the "fifth domain" of security, following land, sea, air and cyberspace.</p>
      <p>Testy ties with Russia and counter-terrorism efforts are also on the agenda.</p>
