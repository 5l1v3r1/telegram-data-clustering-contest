      <p>During a live Q&amp;A with David Walliams last night, Elton John has spoken about his friend Freddie Mercury and his final days.</p>
      <p>In 1991 the Queen frontman died after a secret battle with Aids and now Elton has admitted he didn’t see his friend often towards the end, saying he was ‘terrifying’ to look at.</p>
      <p>However, the Rocketman singer – who was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/elton-john-embraces-lewis-hamilton-sharing-iconic-backstage-reunion-kiki-dee-11184820/"> speaking in front of a live audience at Eventim Apollo</a> to promote his autobiography Me: Elton John with Waterstones – said up until his death Freddie was only thinking of everyone else.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t go and see him often as Aids was terrifying and he was physically terrifying to look at,’ Elton said, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz/elton-john-sleeps-final-freddie-20919374">according to Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>‘While he was dying he was still buying things at auction.</p>

      <p>‘He wasn’t thinking about dying at all. He showed no fear to me about dying, no fear or sadness. When you went there you had an audience with Freddie.’</p>

      <p>Elton recalled receiving a gift from Freddie of a watercolour painting that continues to sit next to his bed.</p>
      <p>‘On Christmas morning Tony King came round and gave me this pillow case,’ Elton explained.</p>
      <p>‘As you read in the book my drag name is Sharon and Freddie was Melina.</p>
      <p>‘In this beautiful pillow case was this watercolour painting.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘In the note that went with it said “Dear Sharon, I saw this at auction and I thought you would love it. I love you Malena”.’</p>

      <p>‘It was really moving. He was dying and he still thought of his friends,’ Elton said.</p>
      <p>‘I still have it on it’s easel and I still have the pillowcase next to my bed.</p>
      <p>‘That is the type of person he was. He was so so full of love and life.’</p>
      <p>Fans were moved by his story, as they took to social media to praise Elton for his candour.</p>

      <p>‘Elton John talking about Freddie Mercury tonight.. I was in tears but so many laughs aswell tonight, thank you @eltonofficial, just thank you!!’ one wrote, as another added: ‘The Freddie Mercury story had me in tears…’</p>
      <p>Previously Freddie’s former personal assistant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/elton-johns-sweet-surprise-freddie-mercurys-best-friends-just-weeks-queen-stars-death-10976922/">recalled the star did visit Freddie before he passed.</a></p>
      <p>‘We all knew that the end was coming. I think it was maybe a week before Elton came. He had to go to Paris to record so he gave us all his numbers to call him should anything happen,’ Peter Freestone revealed to Metro.co.uk.</p>

      <p>‘But it was within a week that Freddie died the last time he visited.</p>
      <p>‘Press were outside the house 24 hours a day and they would question anybody who came to the front door.</p>
      <p>‘What Elton used to do, he would drive himself in his mini and park in the mews behind Garden Lodge.’</p>
      <p>Elton’s memoir has been filled with plentiful tales from his time growing up and navigating life as one of the world’s biggest superstars.</p>
      <p>However he’s saved more tales to regale his fans without outside the pages, after he recently<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/elton-john-had-to-learn-how-to-walk-again-after-being-stuck-down-with-serious-infection-amid-cancer-battle-11178642/"> revealed he was just moments from death</a> during his battle with prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>Elton had a build up of fluid under his colon, which left him in excruciating pain and needing to wear a nappy on stage as he performed in Las Vegas in 2017.</p>
      <p>Talking on the BBC One documentary Uncensored, Elton said: ‘I went to South America and played in Santiago and I came home, and I got to London and I was very ill. And I was rushed into hospital on intensive care.</p>
      <p>‘I picked up an awful bug from somewhere. And I was about 24 hours from snuffing it. We didn’t tell people that was going on at the time, so I had an annus horribilis as they say for half the year.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was “please don’t let me die, I want to see my children”, and luckily I survived it.</p>
      <p>‘Now I’m fine but there’s very few bits of me left. There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker, there’s no tonsils, there’s no prostate, there’s no appendix, I’ve had kidney stones. I’m like the Bionic Woman.’</p>
