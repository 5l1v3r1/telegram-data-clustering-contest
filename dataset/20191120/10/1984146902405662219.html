      <h1>Our Top 200 biggest climbers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:54:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author">Evening Chronicle</a></address>
      <p>THE biggest climber this year in our Top 200 index is Bloom Procurement Services, which goes up 64 places to 74th position, increasing turnover more than 80% to £94.3m.</p>
      <p>This is even more impressive as Bloom was a new entrant last year on the back of an 82% rise in turnover. The Newcastle-based business procures consultancy and specialist professional service suppliers to the UK public sector.</p>
      <p>Established in 2012, Bloom currently works with more than 320 central and local government departments and government agencies, such as the NHS. At present, the growing company employs 65 staff across offices in Newcastle, London and Manchester.</p>

      <p>The second biggest climber is Pin Point Recruitment of Gateshead, which has gone up 59 places from 199 to 140, on the back of a rise in turnover of just 4.64% to £48.5m.</p>
      <p>The table’s biggest climber in terms of percentage rise in turnover was Newcastle United, which more than doubled revenues to £178.4m, to lift it 33 places to number 49. This reflects the fact that the previous year’s turnover was £85.7m, which the club earned during its single season in the Championship. Not only did promotion mean an increase in TV money, the club also enjoyed a rise in commercial income to £26.7m.</p>
      <p>The fifth biggest climber in the table is the Greencoft Bottling Company, based in Annfield Plain, County Durham, which had a 33% rise in turnover to take it up 40 places to 164. If its turnover was added to that of its sister company Lanchester Wine Cellars – which is the 16th biggest climber – the two businesses would hold second position in the biggest climbers’ table.</p>
      <p>LJJ Holdings of Stockton has risen 32 places to 116 with a 21% increase in turnover to £59.4m.</p>
