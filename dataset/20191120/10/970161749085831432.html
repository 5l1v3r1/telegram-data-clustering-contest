      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> striker Troy Parrott has not got off to the best start with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> after ‘liking’ a post on Twitter which criticised the new Spurs manager.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has now officially replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> as manager after the Argentine was surprisingly sacked by Spurs on Tuesday evening less than six months after guiding the team to a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of work since he was axed by Manchester United nearly a year ago and left Old Trafford under a cloud after he was involved in bust-ups with several players including Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese was also heavily criticised for his playing style towards the end of his reign at Old Trafford, and having spent nearly £400 million on signings he left United 19 points behind Liverpool, who were the Premier League leaders at the time of his departure.</p>

      <p>And judging by his social media activity, Parrott might be sceptical over Mourinho’s arrival as he ‘liked’ a post from a supporter who urged him to join Manchester United because Spurs are ‘f*****’ under the Portuguese.</p>

      <p>Parrott subsequently removed the Twitter post from his likes but not before Spurs fans had spotted it.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old striker was given his Tottenham debut by Pochettino earlier this season in their Carabao Cup defeat to Colchester United in September.</p>
      <p>Parrott has made only one Premier League squad this season – the 1-1 draw against Everton earlier this month – but he was left on the bench by Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, meanwhile, will take charge of Spurs for the first time on Saturday as his side travel to West Ham.</p>
