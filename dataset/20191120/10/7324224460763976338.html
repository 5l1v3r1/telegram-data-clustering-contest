      <p>Craig Watts was the winning bidder in a second online auction with a winning bid of £1.1million for the Chase Park site in Church Lane, Hatherton.</p>
      <p>That figure is £350,000 less than its previous sale price when it was snapped up by businessman Mo Chaudry in the summer – only to pull out of the deal weeks later.</p>
      <p>Cannock-based Mr Watts had hoped to purchase the site earlier in the year but a wrangle with Sport England over the length of lease offered to the cricket and hockey clubs prompted banks to call in receivers.</p>
      <p>Mr Watts said after previously supporting Chase Park, he was pleased to be the successful bidder at the latest auction.</p>
      <p>He said: “Primarily, as previously noted, sport is still key to the facility for the community and schools alike. I am hopeful that a new start will bring new opportunities in all sport areas.</p>
      <p>“Finally the future of what can be achieved will centre around financial sustainability and so ongoing negotiations between local councils and the new owner are very important.”</p>
      <p>Since the site was placed into receivership, Cannock Cricket Club have moved to a new home in Littleworth Road, Rawnsley.</p>
      <p>It is the former home of C&amp;R Hawks Cricket Club, which vacated the site this summer.</p>
      <p>Cannock Hockey Club has been playing games at Erasmus Darwin Academy, in Burntwood, and Aldersley, Wolverhampton.</p>
