      <h1>Aussie Broadband is tracking bush fire locations to offer assistance to affected Aussie NBN customers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:30:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Duncan Jaffrey</a></address>
      <p>Data, it’s everywhere, and if we could just organise it a little better it’s possible to make a difference … after all that was the original mission of Google, “to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”.</p>
      <p>One engineer at Aussie Broadband seems to think the same way, and has built a system to assist Aussie Broadband to identify customers affected by the bush fires and offer assistance.</p>
      <p>By cross-referencing NBN deployment data, geo-coded bushfire location maps and Aussie’s NBN customer locations, Software Development Manager David Barr was able to create a simple way of detecting customers who had lost their NBN connection due to bush fire.</p>

      <p>With this data, Aussie Broadband was able to contact those customers and pro-actively offer them credits on their account for services they couldn’t use, and other assistance where applicable.</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s easy to look at this and be cynical, or even cry data privacy, but let’s just stop and perhaps acknowledge what’s actually happened here.</p>
      <p>A software development geek found a way of using their skills to maybe help people affected by the harsh Australian bush fire season, and try and help in some small way.</p>
      <p>I bet you that’s more than most of us will end up doing to help. So well played Mr Barr, well played. That’s using the initiative mate.</p>
