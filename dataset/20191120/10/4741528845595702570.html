      <h1>GTBank, Access, FBNH, Standard Chartered wrestle over women entrepreneurs </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:17:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/abiola-odutola/" target="_blank">Abiola Odutola</a></address>
      <p>GTBank Plc, Access Bank Plc, Standard Chartered Plc and First Bank Holding Plc, among others, are currently scrambling over one another to ensure that <b>full gender equity</b> in Nigeria is effected, as they have introduced several initiatives to empower women to actualize their passions.</p>
      <p><b>According to a <a href="https://www.cfr.org/interactive/womens-participation-in-global-economy/?utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_source=postcards&amp;utm_campaign=gender-parity-postcards">report</a> </b>released by McKinsey Global Institute and the Council on Foreign Relations, full gender equity could add 23% or $229 billion to the gross domestic product of the most populous black nation by 2025, the highest of any African nation.</p>
      <p><b>To ensure that Nigeria’s GDP</b> is boosted as predicted by the report, the financial institutions are using different loan facilities, which are specially designed for women, to attract their female depositors across the nation.</p>

      <p><i>“The lender is also finding that women are better savers, are more loyal and are better at repaying debt. Their non-performing loans ratio is less than 1%, compared with about 6% across the group,” </i>she added.</p>
      <p><b>Head, Local division</b>, Standard Chartered, Dayo Aderugbo, explained that Nigerian unit plans to give management training through a women-focused program that it has deployed in the U.S., Kenya, Pakistan and the U.A.E.</p>

There is a steady growing population of women in business in Nigeria and the bank sees this as an opportunity to equally make tangible, measurable impact.”</i></p>
