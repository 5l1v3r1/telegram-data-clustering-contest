      <h1>Conservatives Play Silly Buggers on Twitter but Escape Actual Consequences</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:30:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>During the live TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn last night, the party's Twitter account underwent a sneaky rebrand.</p>
      <p>It replaced its username - usually just the account's Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/CCHQPress">@CCHQPress</a> - and usual branding with the username factcheckUK, complete with an overhauled aesthetic. The issue is that - despite retaining its Twitter handle - the overhaul of the username and branding seems like a fairly obvious attempt at masquerading as an impartial, independent fact checking account.</p>
      <p>Twitter did call out the bullshit and threatened "decisive corrective action" if the Convervative's social media team decided to have another crack at it, explaining that it has “global rules in place that prohibit behavior that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts.”</p>
      <p>The party's Twitter account is still displaying 'factcheckUK's' verdict on the debate, crowning Boris as the winner.</p>

      <p>Conservative Party chairman James Cleverley insisted that the fault lies with everyone else, telling Sky News that "we made it absolutely clear it is the Conservative party website. We were checking the claims put forward,” he said. Seems legit. Why else would you change the aesthetic and username of your Twitter account to something that, at first glance, has diddly squat to do with the Conservative party, and very much sounds like an independent, unbiased body, like actual fact-check charity Full Fact, which had something to say about all of this.</p>
      <p>"It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account ‘factcheckUK’ during this debate," it <a href="https://twitter.com/FullFact/status/1196887778736390146">tweeted</a>. "Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service," is added, citing the names of other independent fact-checking organisations.
