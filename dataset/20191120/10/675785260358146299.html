      <h1>Mino Raiola's role in Man Utd transfer pursuit of Erling Haaland</h1>
      <h2>Erling Haaland has a host of top European sides chasing his signature with Man Utd no exception and Mino Raiola is looking to helped the forward make his decision</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:53:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Mino Raiola has offered his guidance to Erling Haaland as the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> supremo Ed Woodward eyes a move for the youngster.</p>
      <p>The super agent, who spent much of his summer trying to get Paul Pogba out of Old Trafford, retains a good relationship with the United Executive vice chairman.</p>
      <p>Raiola helped Matthijs de Ligt secure a lucrative move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in the summer after he enjoyed a breakthrough season at Ajax and could do likewise with Haaland, reports the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/erling-braut-haaland-man-utd-transfer-latest-what-we-know-so-far-85-million-january-target-a4291061.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574239840">Evening Standard</a> .</p>
      <p>Woodward has made it clear that funds are available for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to make "world class acquisitions."</p>

      <p>Haaland is likely to cost around £85m having shot to prominence this season with Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian has scored 26 goals this season including six in three Champions League outings.</p>
      <p>Those exploits in front of goal have attracted the interest of European big shots <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> .</p>

      <p>Given Haaland's age profile £85m could represent good value given the years ahead of him and Solskjaer is hoping his contacts can enhance United's chances of securing a deal.</p>
      <p>Jim Solbakken, Solskjaer's representative, is close with Alfe Inge Haaland - Erling's father - which could also prove pivotal.</p>
      <p>Alfe played in the Premier League with Leeds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , but his past is not set to have an influence on his son's decision.</p>
      <p>Salzburg will be reluctant to sell their star man midway through the campaign which could see him loaned back to the Austrians were a deal struck in January.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is eyeing a forward with Mario Mandzukic the most likely man through the Old Trafford door given his availability.</p>
      <p>But Haaland's future could very much depend on which club is willing to act first and United are looking to steal a march on their rivals at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
