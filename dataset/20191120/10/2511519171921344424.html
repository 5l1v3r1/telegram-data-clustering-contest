      <h1>Ed Sheeran's plans for boat-shaped prayer retreat on his estate approved</h1>
      <h2>The new development aims to be a 'private place of retreat for contemplation and prayer'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:47:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Joanna Whitehead</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ed-sheeran">Ed Sheeran</a> has been given permission to build a boat-shaped place of worship on his country estate in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Suffolk">Suffolk</a>.</p>
      <p>The multimillionaire singer-songwriter submitted an application for a “private place of retreat for contemplation and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/prayer">prayer</a>” on his sprawling estate which has been dubbed ‘Sheeranville’. </p>
      <p>Despite objections from the parish council, who expressed concerns about large lorries waiting outside the property, East Suffolk Council authorised this on 19 November.</p>
      <p>Philip Ridley from East Suffolk Council, said: "The planning application has been approved in accordance with the objectives of the National Planning Policy Framework and local plan to promote the delivery of sustainable development and to approach decision taking in a positive way."</p>
      <p>According to the design statement submitted by architects Donald Insall Associates, the 28-year-old hitmaker intends to use it for key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and social gatherings, and hopes it will provide a peaceful place for guests.</p>

      <p>The place of worship will be built towards his home’s eastern boundary because "the rising of the sun is relevant both in the Abrahamic and oriental traditions", according to planning statements.</p>
      <p>To ensure it does not overshadow the nearby Church of St Mary, the new development will have a leaf-shaped roof and a “cone” rather than a spire. </p>
      <p>“The proposed building would be a space truly ancillary to the main house, but apart from it in order to provide calm and separation,” read the statement.</p>
      <p>The application cites guests and visiting colleagues from “many countries, faiths and customers, including the USA, Ireland, Ghana, Nigeria, Asia and Australia”. </p>
      <p>Such visitors would be able to retreat to the space for contemplation, prayer and relaxation “in peace and safety”. </p>
      <p>The building design is described as “novel and modern” with stained glass windows and curved walls which give it a “sweeping boat shaped feel”. </p>
      <p>Sheeran lives on the estate with his wife Cherry Seaborn. </p>
      <p>In 2018, the singer submitted plans for a wedding chapel for he and Cherry to wed in, but these were rejected. </p>
      <p>Since moving to the estate, Sheeran has added a ‘man cave’ to the original farmhouse complete with a recording studio, billiard room, Jacuzzi and gym.</p>
      <p>The site also incorporates a pub with a cinema, treehouse, a garage which looks like a barn and an outdoor kitchen for BBQs.</p>
      <p>A wildlife pond on the estate drew complaints from locals who claimed it was being used as a swimming pool, as it had steps, a handrail and a jetty.</p>
      <p>Council officials allowed him to retain the pond, but ordered him to remove a wooden caravan which had been converted into a sauna. </p>
      <p>In 2018, the singer was criticised after securing planning permission to build “anti-homeless” railings outside his £8m London home.</p>
