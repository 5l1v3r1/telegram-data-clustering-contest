      <p>Jose Mourinho is back in the world of football management after agreeing a four-year deal to take over at Tottenham Hotspur after Spurs sacked Mauricio Pochettino – and Man United fans reckon Nemanja Matic will follow ‘The Special One’.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday evening after a dismal start to the 2019-20 campaign that has seen Spurs win just three of their 12 Premier League matches. Mourinho signed a deal at Tottenham until 2023 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There has already been talk that Mourinho may be looking to hire a director of football to help him bring in some players ahead of the January transfer window. It remains to be seen what Mourinho will do with the likes of Christian Eriksen.</p>

      <p>Mourinho has been out of work since leaving Manchester United in December 2018, where he spent plenty of money on a number of players during his time at Old Trafford – including Paul Pogba, Romelu Lukaku and Fred for more than £200m.</p>
      <p>Matic was a £40million (<a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-jose-mourinho-signings-15127455">MEN</a>) signing from Chelsea during Mourinho’s reign at Manchester United, after working with the Serbian during his time at Stamford Bridge. Matic is out of contract at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Manchester United fans are desperate on Twitter for Mourinho to take Matic to north London, with many predicting that the former Benfica star could Mourinho’s first signing as Tottenham manager.</p>
