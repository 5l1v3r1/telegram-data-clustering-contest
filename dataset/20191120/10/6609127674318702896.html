      <p>Jamieson regularly posts pictures of young dogs on Facebook, often promoting his Instagram page BulliesSouthside.</p>
      <p>An insider claims he imports the designer pooches, selling them for thousands or offering them out as studs for £600 a pop.</p>
      <p>The source told the <a href="http://bit.ly/2O2OvId">Daily Record</a>: "He buys top-end French bulldogs and English bulldogs and breeds them.</p>

      <p>“He sells semen and studs them out at a minimum of £600 a go.</p>
      <p>“The rest are kept at the homes of friends and family members and associates, on the basis they do two litters for him then the dogs become their pet after he gets that.</p>
      <p>“He’s got the best dogs as they’re mainly imported. His dogs sell from £3500 upwards.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Jamieson — previously jailed for his part in a £9million drugs gang — took a <a href="http://bit.ly/37iM6AR">luxury holiday with feared crime boss</a> Jamie ‘Iceman’ Stevenson, 54.</p>
      <p>The underworld associates travelled to millionaires’ paradise Dubai, <a href="http://bit.ly/37iM6AR">posing for photos in designer gear and pricey watches</a> in a swanky nightclub.</p>
      <p>The gangster pals stayed at the five-star Five Palm Jumeirah hotel — whose past guests include pop star Liam Payne.</p>

      <p>The house, built in 2013, has French doors, two en suite bathrooms and a garage.</p>
