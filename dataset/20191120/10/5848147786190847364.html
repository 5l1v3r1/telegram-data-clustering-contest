      <h1>Newstart so low there’s no point setting a budget, senators told</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:35:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/rebecca-gredley/" target="_blank">Rebecca Gredley</a></address>
      <p>People on Newstart are on such little money they see no point in having a budget, senators have been told.</p>
      <p>A Senate inquiry into the adequacy of Newstart – about $278 per week – has kicked off in Melbourne with various women’s advocacy groups.</p>
      <p>“Our financial counsellors are severely stretched,” Stella Avramopoulos, chief executive of Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand, told the hearing on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Many tell us there’s actually no point in helping a client on Newstart to do a budget because there’s not enough money whichever way they cut it.”</p>
      <p>Good Shepherd sees two main types of women in financial distress – single parents and older women.</p>
      <p>“The woefully inadequate level of Newstart is failing these women more than any others in the community,” Ms Avramopoulos said.</p>
      <p>“Sadly, often a job is not the best form of welfare and Newstart is no longer a transitional payment for many people.”</p>

      <p>There has been an increase in women using “predatory” payday loans from 177,000 in 2016 to 287,000 this year.</p>
      <p>Of those, more than 40 per cent are single parents, Ms Avramopoulos said.</p>
      <p>The Morrison government has resisted growing calls to increase the $40-a-day welfare payment.</p>
      <p>Tasmania’s Liberal premier Will Hodgman and NSW’s deputy premier John Barilaro from the National Party are the latest conservative politicians to call on the federal government to increase the payment.</p>
