      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> and Ajay Devgn’s little girl <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nysa-Devgn">Nysa Devgn</a> is all grown up and is now looking like a spitting image of her gorgeous mom. All thanks to her large fan-following on social media, a photo showing the similarities between the mother-daughter duo, has been doing the rounds online.</p>
      <p>The click not only sees the lovely ladies flashing their best smiles, but also sees them donning matching red caps.</p>
      <p>It was only early Wednesday morning that we saw the mother-daughter-duo at the Mumbai airport. While Nysa kept her look cool, comfortable and trendy, Kajol was spotted in a simple salwar khameez.</p>
