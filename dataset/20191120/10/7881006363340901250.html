      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: On Wednesday, Congress leader Anand Sharma asked the Centre to restore Special Protection Group (SPG) cover withdrawn from four leader of the Congress including interim party president Sonia Gandhi.</p>
      <p>Sharma, deputy leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, emphasised that issues of personal safety, security and lives of leaders had to be beyond partisan political considerations.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Please rise above them, review and restore. That would be national interest; otherwise the intention would be questioned. Today, tomorrow and in the future,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the government replaced SPG security cover given to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra with Z-plus security cover of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).</p>
      <p>As no other minister responded to the Congress, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party instead fielded its working president JP Nadda to counter the Congress charge that the decision to strip the Gandhis of their security cover was driven by politics.</p>
      <p>Rebutting Sharma, Nadda said: “The security has not been withdrawn. There is nothing political. The Home Ministry has got a very set pattern and there is a protocol. This is not done by a politician. It is done by the Home Ministry and according to threat perception, security is given and withdrawn.”</p>
