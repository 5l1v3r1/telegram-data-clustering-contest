      <p>Ajumako (C/R), Nov. 19, GNA - Nana Afresi Brempong VII, Saanahene of Ajumako Traditional Area, has appealed to parents, guardians and teachers to live exemplary lives for children to emulate.</p>
      <p>Such efforts, he said, would mentor them and help improve the lot of the entire society.</p>
      <p>Nana Afresi Brempong VII, who is also the Odikro of Ajumako Tweikrom, said this in an interview with Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Ajumako.</p>
      <p>He said God has a purpose for each child adding that there is the need for parents to use their limited resources to work closely with teachers to develop the talents of children.</p>
      <p>The Saanahene said the youth should prioritise their education to contribute positively to the society.</p>
      <p>He said there is no limited time to acquiring education or knowledge but students must desist from wasting long hours to browsing unnecessary sites and rather read their books.</p>
      <p>Nana Brempong called on his people and the entire citizens of Ajumako Traditional Area to come out in their numbers to elect people who are selfless, committed and with good track records as assembly members in the forthcoming Assembly and Unit Committee elections.</p>
