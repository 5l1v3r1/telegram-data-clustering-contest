      <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> had some pretty major problems when it was released on PC earlier this month. I’d say it had a rough launch day but for many it took <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/rockstar">Rockstar</a> nearly a week to actually get the game <i>running</i> for a lot of people. It seems, however, that there are still some issues lurking within the game that directly tie into <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/nvidia">Nvidia</a> users.</p>
      <p>If you are one of those people, then I may have good news for you. The latest Nvidia hotfix driver (441.34) will look to correct some of the last remaining gremlins in RDR2. Well, those that Nvidia has any control over at least.</p>

      <h3>NVIDIA Hotfix Driver Version 441.34 Fixes</h3>
      <p>As this is a hotfix, this is only an update looking to correct certain isolated issues associated with Nvidia graphics cards and their associated technologies. As such, unless you’re having one of the issues below, you can feel free to skip it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2 – Vulkan: Stalling on some systems with 4-core and 6-core CPUs</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider – Game may crash when launched in DX12 mode.</li>

      <h3>Where Can I Grab the Update?</h3>
      <p>As this is a hotfix update, the Nvidia GeForce Experience app will likely not prompt you to make the download automatically. You can, however, learn more about it (as well as manually download it) <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4930?linkId=100000009101497">via the link here!</a></p>
