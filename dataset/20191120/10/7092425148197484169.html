      <p>Ryan said: "It's getting very exciting now. This just got real, toyswise of course because look this is a jumper I have been asked to wear, and I wasn't even asked to wear this, I volunteered to wear it for the Toy Show promo which you're going to be seeing in the next day or two on TV and online and on the air."</p>
      <p>He then joked: "And in the sky written in the clouds and peppered with Smarties and Skittles and glitter, environmentally friendly glitter."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/auditions-for-the-late-late-toy-show-held-in-cork-today-340897"><i>Tubridy</i></a> went on to tease the possible theme of The Late Late Toy Show and he dropped a massive hint as to what it could be by saying that there are two sides to every story.</p>

      <p>In the video, he added: "The beautiful thing about this jumper is, that like every story, there's two sides, so all I'll have to say to you is watch the promo, start getting Christmassey and we'll see you on the other side."</p>
