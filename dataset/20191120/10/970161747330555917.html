      <p>Christmas in New York is a magical thing. We’ve seen the movies. We know it involves, ice-rinks and shopping for diamonds in the snow and an unlikely romance.</p>
      <p>And now you can spend your NYC Christmas trip literally inside your favourite festive film – in an Elf-themed hotel suite.</p>
      <p>Throughout the month of December at<a href="https://clubwyndham.wyndhamdestinations.com/deals-and-offers/midtown-45-holiday-suite?utm_source=Pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=Vanity&amp;utm_campaign=holidaysuite"> Club Wyndham Midtown 45</a> in Manhattan, will be transforming one of it’s suites into a room fit for Buddy and his friends.</p>

      <p>The ceiling will be adorned with paper snowflakes and popcorn garlands, the bathroom looks like a giant Christmas present, and there are enough sweets and Pop-Tarts to satisfy the biggest sweet tooth.</p>
      <p>There’s a fully decorated Christmas tree with presents underneath, toy trains, a giant nutcracker and one wall is entirely made of presents.</p>

      <p>The bedroom is all about the red and green, with snowy white blankets, and fake snow on the window sill. It also has a present wall around the television.</p>
      <p>The bathroom is decked out in a similarly over-the-top fashion. The walk-in shower is wrapped with a giant red ribbon, and cotton wool buds are held in a basket that looks like Santa’s shorts.</p>
