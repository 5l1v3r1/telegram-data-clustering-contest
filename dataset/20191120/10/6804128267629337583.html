      <h1>The big Manchester United failure that will make Jose Mourinho a success at Spurs</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has replaced Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:21:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Graeme Souness has explained why Jose Mourinho's acrimonious exit from Manchester United will help <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> left Old Trafford after a poor start to the 2018/19 campaign and his departure led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer taking the helm.</p>
      <p>But whilst Mourinho's time in Manchester came hastily to an end, he still did what he has done everywhere he's been - won trophies.</p>
      <p>The problem for Mourinho at United was unhappiness in the dressing room and key stars under performing.</p>
      <p>Souness, however, feels that this negative end to his United career will spark the former Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid boss into life again as he takes over from <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a>.</p>
      <p>"Deep inside he is an angry and frustrated man with the way it turned out for him at United and Spurs will reap the benefit of that," Souness told Sky Sports. "Will they win the league this year? No. But they will be far more difficult to play against.</p>
      <p>"He talks common sense and that is basically what football is about. Off-camera he is jovially funny, he is engaging, extremely knowledgeable and desperate to get back into football.</p>
      <p>"He will know where he could have done better and decisions he made he wishes he hadnâ€™t made. Spurs will reap the benefit of that big time."</p>
      <p>On his appointment, Mourinho said: "I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
