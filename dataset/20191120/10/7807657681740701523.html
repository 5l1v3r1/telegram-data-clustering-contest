      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Sadly, you cannot add speakers to a gaming chair. However, you <i>can</i> get gaming chairs that have speakers built into them.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gaming chair with speakers: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rocker-51259-Audio-Gaming-Wireless/dp/B004F1KXVG/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71886YYw">X Rocker Pro Series H3</a> ($169 at Amazon)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>So, why can't you add speakers?</h4>
      <p>The reason why you can't add speakers to your gaming chair is that any gaming chairs that don't already have them built-in won't have any space or room to hold speakers of your own. On top of this, managing the cables would be a serious pain.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, though, you can get gaming chairs that have built-in speakers.</p>
      <h3>What chair with speakers should you buy?</h3>

      <p>When it comes to choosing a gaming chair that has speakers built-in, we recommend going with the X Rocker Pro Series H3. It's packing quad front-facing speakers and powerful subwoofers that deliver an immersive and compelling sound experience. The chair is entirely compatible with both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 since all you need to do to get it working is to plug in the red and white A/V cables that would usually plug into your television into the chair instead. You can also connect the chair to your console wirelessly using X Rocker's wireless signal transmitter that's included in the box.</p>
      <p>Aside from the excellent speaker system, the chair also features thick, comfy leather cushions and a cool vibration system that you can toggle on or off. It's compact, too, since you can fold it up if you need to move it. Lastly, the chair has a weight capacity of 275 pounds, which will be enough for most gamers. Overall, if your heart is set on getting a gaming chair with speakers in it, things don't get better than the X Rocker Pro Series H3.</p>
