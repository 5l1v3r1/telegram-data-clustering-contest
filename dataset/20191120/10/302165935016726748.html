      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 20 — The ringgit ended lower against the US dollar today in line with most emerging Asian currencies, following the escalation of the US-China trade war, said a dealer.</p>
      <p>At 6pm, the ringgit finished at 4.1640/1670 against the greenback from yesterday’s close of 4.1560/1590.</p>
      <p>The dealer said the continuous trade war risk would likely cause a further weakening of China’s yuan performance and by extension could weaken the ringgit due to its very tight correlation.</p>
      <p>China’s yuan slipped to a new two-week low in overnight trading after US President Donald Trump threatened to raise new tariffs on Chinese imports if ongoing trade negotiations fail.</p>
      <p>“At the moment, more investors have shifted their interest towards safe-haven currencies,” the dealer said.</p>
      <p>The local note also traded mostly lower against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit was weaker against the Singapore dollar at 3.0579/0613 from 3.0534/0567 yesterday, depreciated against the yen to 3.8399/8437 from 3.8202/8240 and fell against the euro to 4.6066/6104 from 4.5990/5040.</p>
      <p>However, the local note went up vis-a-vis the British pound to 5.3749/3808 from 5.3829/3884. — Bernama</p>
