      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Renowned local folk singer Shoukat Ali has been admitted to the Services Hospital Lahore on account of a severe liver infection. As per the latest reports, he is in critical condition and the hospital administration is trying its best to ensure a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>“My health is really not good right now and it is getting worse as I am getting older,” Ali told <i>The Express Tribune</i>. “In such a condition, all I can do is ask my fans and the people of Pakistan to remember me in their prayers. I have been working in the music industry for the last 55 years and have always tried to do my best for the profession as well as my country. Surely, I will go back to singing once I am better. But for now, I really just need everyone’s prayers.”</p>
      <p>Ali is one of the most popular folk singers to have come out of Pakistan, with a number of super hit tracks under his belt. He reached the peak of his career during the India-Pakistan wars of 1965 and 1971, when his patriotic song <i>Saathiyon Mujahidon Jaag Utho</i>, amongst others, became an anthem of sorts.</p>
      <p>But Ali has also lent his voice to Sufi poetry, including the works of Saiful Malook, Bulleh Shah and Heer Waris Shah. Besides Pakistan, he has performed in countries across the world and continues to enthrall his fans with his music whenever he gets the chance.</p>
      <p>Upon hearing the news of Ali’s hospitalisation, provincial minister Mian Aslam Iqbal contacted the Secretary Health to ensure the singer was being given the best healthcare possible.</p>
