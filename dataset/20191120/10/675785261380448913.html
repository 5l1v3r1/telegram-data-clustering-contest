      <h2>Manchester United are interested in signing Erling Haaland from Red Bull Salzburg in January but his father is said to be less keen on the switch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:47:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Erling Haaland's father is keen for the teenager to make a move to Germany this summer.</p>
      <p>Haaland, 19, has attracted interest from a host of top European clubs after a stunning start to the season with Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are keen on striking a deal for the striker in January, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> both keeping tabs on him.</p>
      <p>Haaland's father Alf-Inge played in the Premier League with Leeds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> but doesn't believe it is the right move for his son right now.</p>
      <p>Bild reports Haaland's father would prefer him to take a smaller step for his next move, rather than join a major European side.</p>

      <p>He has stressed the importance of Haaland playing regularly, rather than moving somewhere and struggling for game time.</p>
      <p>That could work in the favour of RB Leipzig, who are owned by the same company as Salzburg.</p>
      <p>The two sides have shared players in the past, including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> pair Sadio Mane and Naby Keita.</p>
      <p>Leipzig are believed to have recognised Haaland's potential before he shot to stardom and remain interested in signing him.</p>

      <p>It is claimed the Bundesliga side have the option to sign the striker for a fixed transfer fee of around £27m (€30m) - a significant decrease on the premium United may have to pay.</p>
      <p>Discussing a possible move, Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche said: "The boy is a very good player.</p>
      <p>Both in the league and in the Champions League, he does an exceptionally good job. Of course, we are already looking around for the summer. "</p>
