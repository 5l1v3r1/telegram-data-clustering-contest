      <p>L&amp;L Hawai’i is expanding its Mixplate concept, opening restaurants in Washington state, California and Colorado.</p>
      <p>The first L&amp;L Hawaiian Mixplate opened in Shelton, Wash., last week. Another will open in San Marcos, Calif., later this month, and Aurora, Colo., in December, the company announced today.</p>
      <p>The Mixplate outlets feature a hot bar, from which guests can customize their meals. L&amp;L opened the first Mixplate in Honolulu in the Airport Trade Center in 2017.</p>
      <p>“Our guests will be able to see, smell and sample dishes prior to ordering,” Hawai‘i L&amp;L CEO Elisia Flores said in a news release. “This format helps introduce guests to our fresh Hawaii-inspired flavors as we continue to expand throughout the U.S., and allows each dish to be created around individual preferences.”</p>
      <p>L&amp;L is known for its Hawaii-style plate lunch, which traditionally includes two scoops of rice, macaroni salad and an entree of various beef, chicken and seafood items popular in the islands.</p>
