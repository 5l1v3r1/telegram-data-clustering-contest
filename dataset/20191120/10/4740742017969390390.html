      <h1>Bristol Bears announce coaching shake up ahead of 2020/21 season</h1>
      <h2>Jonathan Thomas set to leave Bristol at the end of the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:03:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">John Evely</a></address>
      <p>Defence coach John Muldoon will replace Jonathan Thomas as Bristol Bears forwards coach ahead of the 2020/21 campaign it has been confirmed today.</p>
      <p>The highly rated 36 year-old who was Pat Lam’s captain at Connacht before the director of rugby arrived at Bristol ahead of the 2017/18 season, will take over the role following the departure of Thomas to Worcester Warriors at the end of the season where he will take up the same position.</p>
      <p>Muldoon joined <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> in the summer of 2018 as defence coach, helping the club to a highest Premiership finish in twelve years.</p>
      <p>Director of rugby Pat Lam said: “We’re delighted that Mul will be stepping up into the role of forwards coach. He’s excited about the opportunity to build on the excellent foundations that JT has put in place.</p>
      <p>“Our philosophy at Bristol Bears is to ideally promote from within and develop our staff to become world-class in their fields. That’s the key thing about our vision, when personnel leave, the systems and structures that have been put in place means that the next person steps in to add value to the good work that’s being done.</p>

      <p>“Mul has all the ingredients to be an outstanding coach, as he has already shown in his efforts with the team defence. We have worked together for a long time and he’s a natural leader. The boys respect him and he knows our systems in great detail.</p>
      <p>“The entire management team are closely aligned in everything we do – we want to be the most dominant pack in the league and Mul can help deliver that ambition.”</p>
      <p>Former Irish international Muldoon said: “Working with Pat and the management team has been a fantastic experience and I’ve learned so much since I arrived in Bristol.</p>
      <p>“It’s a truly unique culture that we have at the Bears and an environment that demands high performance, whether you’re a player, coach or member of staff. I’m excited about the opportunity to take on the forwards coach role next season – it’s a huge challenge.</p>
      <p>“When you have a director of rugby like Pat who believes in you and gives you the tools to succeed, it not only creates a positive atmosphere, but also provides absolute clarity about what is expected and the direction we are going as a club.</p>
      <p>“We have a young, hungry set of forwards and some genuinely world class players, so everything is in place for us to continue to show progress next season and beyond.”</p>
      <p>Former Wales international Thomas explained why he is moving on after four seasons at Bristol.</p>
      <p>He said: “The decision to leave Bristol Bears has been an incredibly difficult one. I’ve loved my time here and grown so much from the experience – I’m grateful for their understanding and support,” said Thomas.</p>

      <p>“Coaching at the top level requires a huge amount of time and emotional investment and, ultimately, you’re always juggling your work-life balance. Since finishing playing for Worcester in 2015, I’ve continued to live with my wife and three children in South Worcestershire. We have fallen in love with the area and, as a family, are really settled.</p>
      <p>“Obviously, I’m a former Warrior with a close affinity and passion for the club and its supporters. When Alan [Solomons] and the new owners spoke to me about the opportunity and explained the exciting vision they have, it was something that I felt was right for me personally and professionally.</p>
      <p>“First and foremost, my focus now is on the Bears and our goals, so I can leave on a high next summer, hopefully with silverware. That’s what the fans of this club deserve as they are true supporters and have been outstanding the whole time through thick and thin.</p>
      <p>“Pat has been tremendously understanding and supported a really tough decision. That underlines the environment that Bristol has. One thing that really resonates is the close relationship and alignment between all the coaches, players and back room staff.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of what we’ve achieved with this group of forwards and when I depart at the end of the season, the foundations are laid for the next guy to step in and continue that work.</p>

      <p>“Pat talks about the importance of progression and consistency, of leaving a legacy for the next person to take on, and hopefully that’s the case here.”</p>
      <p>Lam added: “JT is an excellent team man and an outstanding young coach. Everybody at Bristol Bears values his effort and contribution to the club over the past four seasons.</p>
      <p>“JT’s development has been superb - he’s shown fantastic growth as a coach and as a person. I’m sad to lose him, but pleased he will have more family time and that he’ll be joining my good friend Solly at Worcester who will continue to oversee his development  into a future world class head coach.</p>
      <p>“It takes a strong character to make tough decisions, but I’m really pleased that JT has put his wife Laura and children Kobi, Maya and Rudy at the forefront of his decision. We support JT wholeheartedly and completely understand his reasons for doing so.</p>
      <p>“Our culture is about love and respecting one another. JT has contributed massively to our vision and he can always be proud of the part that he played in the Bristol Bears story.</p>
      <p>“Until his departure at the end of the campaign, JT remains an integral member of the coaching group as we strive as one team to achieve our season goals.”</p>
