      <p>NEW DELHI: Equity indices on Wednesday closed in green with the benchmark <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sensex">BSE sensex</a> rising 182 points or 0.45 per cent to settle at 40,652. The broader <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/NSE-Nifty">NSE Nifty</a> also climbed 59 points or 0.49 per cent to finish at 11,999.</p>
      <p>The 30-share BSE index touched an all-time high of 40,816 before cooling off some intra-day gains. Top gainers in the sensex pack include Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, Reliance Industries, Maruti and L&amp;T with their stocks rising as much as 5.73 per cent.</p>
      <p>On NSE, Nifty Pharma and Media tracked major gains, up as much as 3.26 per cent.</p>
      <p>Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) rallied nearly 4 per cent to hit their lifetime high of Rs 1,571.85 (intra-day), inching closer to the Rs 10 lakh crore market-capitalisation level, after the company's telecom arm, Reliance Jio, announced tariff hikes in the next few weeks in compliance with rules.</p>
      <p>Rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have already announced their plans to raise rates from next month.</p>
      <p>“Reliance is the major driver (of markets). Once they raise tariffs, the valuation of Jio as well as Reliance also goes up,” Rusmik Oza, head of Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities, told news agency Reuters.</p>
      <p>"Also, there is some interest in private sector banks. The oil PSUs are also getting double benefit from a fall in crude prices as well as the cabinet committee meeting to discuss strategic divestment of some of the companies," he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) offloaded shares worth Rs 915.37 crore in the capital market in the previous session, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth Rs 262.35 crore, data available with stock exchange showed.</p>
