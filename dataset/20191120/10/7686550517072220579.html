      <p>A serial shoplifter has been banned from every single shop in England - apart from one Tesco.</p>
      <p>Anna Burns, 33, was sentenced for a spate of shop thefts from six different big-name stores.</p>
      <p>But after failing to turn up to court on almost a dozen previous occasions Judge Peter Crabtree bailed her to prepare a pre-sentence report.</p>
      <p>The judge at Swindon Crown Court told Burns he needed to look at all the options - including prison.</p>
      <p>In the meantime the judge ordered Burns not to enter any shop - apart from Tesco Metro in The Parade in Swindon town centre, and an NHS walk-in centre less than 400 feet from the court.</p>
      <p>Judge Crabtree told Burns: "The starting point is custody but I’m going to look at all options.</p>
      <p>"Someone needs to do something that stops you repeatedly committing offences and coming back. That may be custody, but I will look at all options."</p>
      <p>Burns appeared before the Crown Court at the start of the month when she was due to be sentenced for four shop thefts.</p>
      <p>These thefts saw her nicking mascara from Boots, two watches from Argos, clothing worth £72 from Mothercare, and food and drink worth £55.40 from Costa Coffee.</p>
      <p>She claimed she was ill and was bailed by Judge Crabtree to go to the NHS walk-in centre less than 400ft from the court building, and return to court at the end of the week.</p>
      <p>Burns hobbled to the health centre accompanied by a probation officer.</p>
      <p>But she left within minutes after hearing she would have to wait half-an-hour to be seen by a nurse.</p>
      <p>She said she wanted to walk home to collect her phone charger then call an ambulance.</p>
      <p>On the Friday - the day she was due before the judge - she was a no-show and a warrant was issued for her arrest.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Peter Pride said: "Being frank about it, this matter was listed for sentence on Monday and as your honour knows, Ms Burns arrived late.</p>
      <p>"You honour was very clear of the need [for her] to be here on Friday."</p>
      <p>John Upton, defending, said his instructing solicitors had not heard from Burns that day.</p>
      <p>Warrants were issued the following week when she did not show-up at court.</p>
      <p>Last Saturday, November 16, she appeared in the dock at Swindon Magistrates’ Court, where she pleaded guilty to stealing £307-worth of goods from Marks and Spencer’s, and £40-worth from Sainsbury’s.</p>
      <p>And yesterday, Judge Crabtree bailed her again, with a requirement she live and sleep at a property on Shepherd Street and co-operate with the probation service in the compilation of a pre-sentence report.</p>
      <p>She was ordered not to enter any shop except the NHS Walk-in Centre and Tesco in The Parade.</p>
      <p>In a nod to Burns’ poor attendance, the judge said: "Make sure you are here.</p>
      <p>''I think you’ve managed to get here once out of about a dozen occasions on time."</p>
