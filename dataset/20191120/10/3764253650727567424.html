      <p>Meanwhile, Atiku's long stay in the United Arab Emirates after the 2019 general elections has been attributed to the need for him to rest.</p>
      <p>An ally of the Peoples Democratic Party's presidential candidates said <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1272497-why-atiku-remained-dubai-6-months.html">his principal took a break just to rest from the hassles of the presidential election</a> and the consequent legal tussle over alleged electoral malpractice.</p>
