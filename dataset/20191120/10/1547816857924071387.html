        <b>Yesterday, we saw Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla fighting like cats and dogs in Bigg Boss 13 house. While it appeared to be all real, there is a slight possibility that the fight was staged</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 is full of fights. There is so much negativity around that even best friends have become enemies now. Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz had a very nasty fight yesterday and it is pretty clear that these guys won't be back to being friends again. However, a  small clip from yesterday's episode gave us hope that their fight could possibly fake. The clip we are talking about has Sidharth 'planning' a fight with Asim in order to entertain the audiences.</p>
      <p>Sidharth Shukla in the clip clear tells Asim that they can have a fight where he can vent out his frustration and even entertain the audiences. Though initially, Asim says that 'no I'm not into that,' he then seems to have agreed with Sidharth. Well, we don't know that their fight actually is fake or not, but by the looks of it, it definitely appears that they are now staunch enemies inside the house who will make every move to get the other down. Watch the clip we are talking about below:</p>

      <p>While we are yet to see whether these two get back to being friends or not, Twitter sure has gone abuzz with their fan clubs poking fun at each other. Sidharth and Asim's fans are doing everything to support their favourite contestant and trends like #StayStrongSidShukla and #WeStandByAsimRiaz are taking over the internet.
