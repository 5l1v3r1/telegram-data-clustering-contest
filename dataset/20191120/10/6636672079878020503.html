        <b>Mouser Electronics has announced a global distribution agreement with sensor manufacturer Amphenol SSI. Through the agreement, Mouser stocks Amphenol SSI products including pressure sensors and gauges, drum liquid level gauges, and combination temperature and pressure gauges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amphenol SSI P51 pressure Mediasensor and P61 pressure and temperature Mediasensor families are micro-machined sensors designed to measure harsh and benign media in automotive, industrial, and commercial applications. The P51 family devices are available in absolute, vented gauge, or sealed gauge conventions, and measure pressures from 3-7500PSI.</p>

      <p>The P61 family transducers and transmitters are available in absolute and sealed gauge configurations, and measure pressures from 100-3000PSI.</p>
      <p>The Mediagauge family comprises three standalone battery-operated digital pressure gauges, each containing a piezoresistive pressure sensing element, signal conditioning for temperature and calibration, a stainless-steel input port, and a four-digit display. These devices are designed for applications such as refrigeration, process control, fuel cells, pumps, hydraulics, pneumatics, compressors, and agriculture.</p>
      <p>Digital Fluid-trac devices are noncontact continuous drum liquid level gauges based on ultrasonic technology.</p>
      <p>The gauges include an LCD display (with 4-20mA output available) and are designed for use on 13-, 30-, and 55-gallon vertical drums storing media such as water, wastewater, motor oil, hydraulic fluid, and diesel fuel.</p>
