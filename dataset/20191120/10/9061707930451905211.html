      <p>Ever wondered what the streets around where you live used to look like?</p>
      <p>Well, if you live in South Derbyshire a new book could well have the answer.</p>
      <p>“How Times Have Changed in South Derbyshire” is the latest publication from the Magic Attic Archive in Swadlincote.</p>
      <p>It contains a series of vintage photographs taken from the Magic Attic database, alongside present day views taken in the same spot by volunteers.</p>
      <p>Captions describe the images and also contain interesting historical information.</p>
      <p>Alan Hiley, a Magic Attic volunteer, said: “Many of our more mature readers will recognise scenes from the past and the younger readers may find it hard to realise that this is how it was.</p>
      <p>“Looking at the present-day photographs it shows a way of life that has gone forever.”</p>

      <p>The book covers numerous villages in South Derbyshire and many of the newer images show just how much demolition of buildings has gone on in the intervening years.</p>
