      <h1>Rangers star Glen Kamara rubs shoulders with world pass masters in key Euro 2020 stat</h1>
      <h2>The Finland midfielder was instrumental as he helped his side qualify for their first ever major tournament.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:03:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:03</time> by <a rel="author">Dailyrecord.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Rangers midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glen-kamara">Glen Kamara</a> was named in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifiers' top five pass masters after he helped Finland to a historic qualification.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox star has been touted for moves down south after becoming a key man for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>'s side this season.</p>
      <p>And the former Dundee playmaker helped his country qualify for their first ever major tournament last week to spark off huge celebrations.</p>
      <p>And after the final qualifiers were completed this week, Kamara's worth to his country was illustrated by official UEFA figures on the stats for the matches.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Kamara made 720 completed passes in Finland's ten games - that made him the fifth best passer of the ball in Europe.</p>
      <p>He was behind Bayern Munich and Germany star Joshua Kimmich who was the best with 897 passes, followed by Belgium's Toby Alderweireld, Italy's Jorginho and Spanish hardman Sergio Ramos.</p>
      <p>Kamara and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> will return to domestic action this weekend as they face Hamilton Accies in the Premiership.</p>
