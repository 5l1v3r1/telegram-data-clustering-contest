      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coca-cola-christmas-truck-tour">Coca-Cola Christmas truck tour</a> dates for this year have officially been confirmed.</p>

      <p>And if you're yet to see the jolly sight in person, then we've got some very good news for you - the full tour dates have finally been announced.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/coca-cola">Coca-Cola</a> has confirmed that the truck, which brings free drinks to cities across the UK and Ireland, will be kicking off its trip on November 15.</p>
      <p>It will visit 19 cities all over the UK including Edinburgh, Leeds, London and Portsmouth.</p>

      <p>The famous red truck will be making stops in Waterford, Ballina, Belfast, Dublin's Royal Hospital Kilmainham and Cork before finishing up in Swords on December 15.</p>
      <p>Guests will be able to purchase exclusive merchandise at each truck stop and will also get to enjoy a can of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Diet Coke, or Coca-Cola Original Taste too.</p>
      <p>Coca-Cola's iconic trucks were first created in 1995 by the W.B. Doner Agency and back then they were known as 'Christmas Caravans'.</p>
      <p>The illuminated lorries were made more enchanting with special effects by the world-famous Industrial Light and Magic, the company behind the Star Wars films.</p>
      <p>Images of Santa Claus adorned the sides of the trucks, which were created by artist Haddon Sundblom.</p>
      <p>Since then, the iconic image has undergone various changes to become the fleet of trucks you see today.</p>
      <p>The Coca-Cola Christmas Truck Tour schedule includes the following stops.</p>
      <p>They will be open from 12pm and the queue for entry will close at 7pm.</p>
