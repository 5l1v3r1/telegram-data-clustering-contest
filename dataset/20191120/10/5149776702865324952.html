      <h2>Pigs in blankets are officially back on the menu for vegans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:10:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Duke, Hayley Watson</a></address>
      <p>Veggies and vegans have often been the afterthought at Christmas - but not anymore.</p>
      <p>There's more on the shelves for vegetarians and vegans at Christmas than ever before, from dairy-free cheeseboards to no-turkey roasts.</p>
      <p>Now, pigs in blankets have been given the meatless treatment, as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/morrisons">Morrisons prepares</a> to launch their version of the Christmas dinner favourite.</p>
      <p>The 'Vegan No-Pigs in Blankets' are made from a blend of jackfruit and chickpeas, wrapped in a streaky pastry blanket.</p>
      <p>They will be available to buy in packs of 10 for £2.50 from Wednesday, November 27, according to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/morrisons-vegan-pigs-in-blankets-17279778">ChronicleLive</a> .</p>

      <p>Morrisons' party food expert, Leanne Walters, said: “Pigs in blankets are one of the UK’s favourite Christmas treats so we have created a meat-free version that can be enjoyed by vegans or anybody else.”</p>
      <p>As well as going on Christmas dinner plates around the country, the vegan pigs in blankets are being billed as a perfect canape for festive get-togethers.</p>
      <p>And they're not the only vegan nibbles in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Morrisons' Christmas 2019 range.</a></p>
      <p>Other highlights include Korean Jackfruit Bao Buns – soft, fluffy bao buns with a BBQ pulled jackfruit filling and mixed vegetables with a spicy gochujang sauce.</p>
      <p>Also on the menu are Katsu Croquettes – crispy croquettes filled with sweet potato, carrot and red pepper in a creamy and warming Katsu curry sauce.</p>
      <p>Both of those will be available in store from December 11.</p>
