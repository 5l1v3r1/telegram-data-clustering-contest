      <p>If you spend £495 on a pair of shoes, you’re probably not going to clean the house while wearing them.</p>
      <p>But shoppers are suggesting that a pair of Jimmy Choo flats look like something you would use to actually wash the floors.</p>
      <p>The green shearling shoes from the designer brand have been compared to a £5 cleaning brush because of the fluffy design.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.jimmychoo.com/en/women/shoes/merlin-flat/green-shearling-ballerina-flats---MERLINFLATSHR030015.html?utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_medium=LinkShare&amp;utm_campaign=UKNetwork&amp;utm_content=10&amp;utm_term=a1LgFw09t88%20&amp;cm_mmc=LinkShareUK-_-Affiliate-_-a1LgFw09t88-_-10&amp;ranMID=37501&amp;ranEAID=a1LgFw09t88&amp;ranSiteID=a1LgFw09t88-cdmQEQz1F66Wixqr1Y.A6w">description for the shoes on the Jimmy Choo website</a> says: ‘Merlin is a fun and funky rework in fluffy AstroTurf coloured shearling.</p>
      <p>‘With a strong, contemporary chiselled toe this green style has a sense of pragmatism, but also of fun.’</p>
      <p>But people on social media weren’t impressed with the style.</p>
      <p>One said: ‘I love shoes. I would love a pair of Jimmy Choo.. But what in the mother of all crap are these???? £495 to look like I have turf or carpet on my feet.’</p>

      <p>A friend replied to her post and said: ‘Get some to shuffle round the house. Clean up the dust!.’</p>
      <p>‘I could stick dusters to my feet for about 50p!!!,’ she laughed.</p>

      <p>Jim Rimmer simply added a picture of a duster on a post about the shoes and said: ‘They cost less than a fiver on Amazon.’</p>
      <p>But the fleecey shoes are already popular with half of the sizes already sold out online.</p>
