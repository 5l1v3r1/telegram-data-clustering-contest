      <p><a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/tool/">Tool</a> fans aren’t the only ones impressed with <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/08/tool-fear-inoculum-review/"><i>Fear Inoculum</i></a>, the band’s fifth studio album. The Recording Academy announced on Wednesday, November 20, that Tool has earned two <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list">Grammy nominations</a> for the record that was 13 years in the making: Best Metal Performance for “7empest” and Best Rock Song for the album’s title track. They’re up against Candlemass, Death Angel, I Prevail, and Killswitch Engage in the first category, and The 1975, Vampire Weekend, Brittany Howard, and Gary Clark Jr. in the second.</p>
      <p>Tool are already three-time Grammy winners: Best Metal Performance in 1997 and 2001 for “<i>Ænima</i>” and “Schism,” respectively, and Best Recording Package in 2006 for <i>10,000 Days</i>.</p>

      <p>Other notable nominees for the 2020 Grammys include <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a> and <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a>, who both received six nods; <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/post-malone">Post Malone</a> nabbed seven; Lizzo topped with eight nominations; and <a href="https://www.spin.com/tag/nipsey-hustle">Nipsey Hustle</a> was honored with three posthumous nods.</p>
      <p>Besides critical accolades, <i>Fear Inoculum</i> also made waves on the charts when it was released on August 30. The 10-song record <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/tool/chart-history/TLP/song/1160759">topped the Billboard 200</a> <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/09/tools-fear-inoculum-no-1-debut-rock-album/">in its debut week</a>, <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/09/maynard-james-keenan-thanos-meme/">knocking Taylor Swift’s <i>Lover</i></a> from the top spot. Per <i>Billboard</i>, it was the biggest debut in more than a year for any rock record. And just prior to <i>Fear Inoculum</i>’s release, Tool <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8527332/tool-break-records-rock-charts-billboard-200-hot-100">took four of the five top spots</a> on the Rock Albums chart after making their discography available for streaming.
