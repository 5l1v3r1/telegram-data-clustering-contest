      <h1>Key Rangers players rated as Steven Gerrard's men approach defining run of games</h1>
      <h2>The Ibrox side are battling for the title and impressing well in Europe but how is each individual doing?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:59:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:59</time> by <a rel="author">Record Sport Online</a></address>
      <p>The first quarter of the league season is over and we're approaching one of the biggest months of the campaign.</p>
      <p>With two huge games against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> - including a cup final - European ties, trips to Easter Road and Pittodrie as well as much more it's going to be an interesting time before the winter break.</p>
      <p>And on the latest <i><b>Record Rangers</b></i> podcast, our top team have discussed how the squad have played this season.</p>
      <p>Host Jonny McFarlane is joined by Scott McDermott and Gavin Berry to look over the season so far and they've got some interesting views.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-kent">Ryan Kent</a> wasn't rated due to his lack of game time so far and unsurprisingly, Alfredo Morelos comes out on top.</p>
      <p>Listen to the full podcast below but here are the full ratings:</p>
      <h3>Allan McGregor - 7</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/allan-mcgregor">McGregor</a> has been very good, no glaring errors come to mind but there's been no season defining saves yet and they may well come in the next few months but he still looked very safe and sound.</p>
      <h3>Wes Foderingham - 4</h3>
      <p><b>Scott: </b>"He's not let anyone down when he's come in. He's not played many games and to be fair to him I think we all know he wants out of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> because he wants to play but one think you can't label against him is his attitude."</p>
      <h3>James Tavernier - 6</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin: </b>"Costly errors at Young Boys and Hearts, missed penalties. You can't ignore his assists and his contribution but missed penalties and mistakes so he needs to improve."</p>
      <h3>Borna Barisic - 7</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin: </b>"Apart from anything else the character he has shown. We thought his time would be up, to come back from that I admire it. Even on the opening day his confidence was gone so to come back from that and doing well on an international level as well."</p>
      <h3>Jon Flanagan - 3</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "He'll maybe feel a wee bit aggrieved he's not playing a bit more but with Tavernier as captain and with Barisic's resurgence he's been unlucky. He played a few games at the start of the season when Barisic was out."</p>
      <h3>Andy Halliday -3</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin:</b> "It's a mixed bag. He'll be remembered as a guy who lived his dream and gave his all when required but maybe didn't quite have the quality when Rangers needed to step it up."</p>
      <h3>Filip Helander - 7</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "You could argue he hasn't played enough, he needed to bide his time to get into the team. No glaring mistakes, we're still to see him in an Old Firm game which is a big test for any defender. He lacks a bit of pace but he's not been exposed yet. The two Porto games have been the biggest European games so far and he played very well in both of them. Looking at the Goldson/Helander partnership and it's been the strongest one so far."</p>

      <h3>Niko Katic - 6</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin:</b> "Katic was playing so well in those early European games. He signed a new contract and he has to count himself extremely unlucky tobe out the team but you look at Goldson and Helander now and you're saying would you put Katic in ahead of them? Probably not. A great guy to have as back up."</p>
      <h3>Connor Goldson - 7</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "I don't think I'd go as high as eight purely for the Celtic mistake. I try to base it on big moments in games and as much as Goldson ha splayed well for the majority of the game so far, he's scored a couple of big goals but that Celtic mistake was big and it was a body blow for Rangers at the time. He's played well but it was a costly error."</p>
      <h3>Steven Davis - 8</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "He was never going to be an attacking midfielder, box-to-box, Rangers fans thoguh get him in be creative, setting up goals but that was never going to be the case. He's now settled in to the position he honed at Southampton and he's one of the best in the league if not the best at that holding role."</p>

      <h3>Glen Kamara - 6</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "It might sound harsh but at the start of the season I though Kamara was going to start every game for Rangers and be vital. He had a slow start, struggled in a few games and it looked as though the midfield three would have him out. Credit to him he's come back in and looks good again. He keeps Rangers ticking over but is he really impacting games enough? I think there's more to come from him"</p>
      <h3>Joe Aribo - 6</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin: </b>"There was so much hype around him, it was a big coup to get him. The Old Firm the occasion seemed to get to him a bit, he's adjusting to Scottish football but seems to be coping better and improving. A great goal against Livingston and will only get better."</p>
      <h3>Ryan Jack - 8</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "The away game at Ross County recently, no disrespect to them, but they were poor that night however I've not seen a Rangers midfielder dominate a game single-handledly like that for quite a while. He's added a few goals to his game, he's now in the Scotland team, he's a first pick for Steven Gerrard in every game."</p>
      <h3>Scott Arfield - 6</h3>
      <p><b>Scott: </b>"He's a guy Gerrard can rely on, he can play in a number of positions and for big games I would still have him in there. He'll know himself his performances will need to improve."</p>

      <h3>Alfredo Morelos - 9</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin:</b> "22 goals, will equal Negri's 33. He's got 11 to go in 10 games, the only thing that will stop him is game time because you'd imagine Defoe will play. He's improved his disciplinary record but not lost the edge, scoring for fun, big goals. Only thing he's missing is a goal against Celtic."</p>
      <h3>Sheyi Ojo - 6</h3>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "He's come up with a couple of big moments like the Feyenoord goal. A few assists. He's flattered to decieve a lot of the time, punters get frustrated by him. Can look lazy at times but like a few, there's more to come."</p>
      <h3>Jermain Defoe - 7</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin: </b>"It's also for what he's getting out of Morelos. He's not started a lot but maybe you could argue for an 8."</p>
      <h3>Steven Gerrard - 8</h3>
      <p><b>Gavin:</b> "To get to the Europa League group for the second season, there's been improvement, a greater determination. More ruthless so he's definitely learned from last season. The Old Firm game he got it wrong and that's the one sort of blip. The draw at Hearts as well but you're not going to win every game."</p>
      <p><b>Scott:</b> "The Old Firm defeat is pretty much the only black mark against his name. You're always going to have a Tynecastle draw or defeat so I wouldn't hold that against him. The Old Firm game he put his hands up and said he got it wrong but you can't underestimate the Europa League qualification and how difficult that was to do it two years in a row."</p>
