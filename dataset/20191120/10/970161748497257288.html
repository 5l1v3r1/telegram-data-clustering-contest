      <p>Around 4,000,000 people are at risk of suffering asthma attacks triggered by flu and colds this winter, a charity estimates.</p>
      <p>A survey by Asthma UK found that three quarters of sufferers said their conditions worsened when they became ill over the colder months.</p>
      <p>They are now urging anyone with the condition to get vaccinated this winter, after one man was left in a coma due to a flu-related asthma attack.</p>
      <p>Adam Blackman, 47, had been struggling to breathe, stating that it felt as though someone had his hands around his neck.</p>
      <p>He ended up spending over a month in hospital, where doctors put him in a coma for a week due to complications which led to pneumonia and a collapsed lung.</p>

      <p>Adam said: ‘It was nearly catastrophic for me, but my friends and family were also at risk. My brother-in-law who has asthma got ill shortly afterwards and ended up in hospital too.</p>

      <p>‘Given how contagious flu can be I would urge everyone to get the flu vaccine, so they don’t have to go through the hell I’ve been through.</p>
      <p>‘I’m not risking it again and have already got the flu vaccine. I am urging everyone with asthma to get it as soon as possible, it could save your life.’</p>
      <p>Flu viruses can increase inflammation in the airways, causing people to cough and wheeze for breath.</p>
      <p>The narrowing of airway then has the potential to trigger a bronchospasm, otherwise known as an asthma attack.</p>
      <p>Asthma attacks can be fatal, with around three people dying in the UK every day.</p>
      <p>Yet only half of people with chronic respiratory disease, including asthma, received their free jab last year, Public Health England reports.</p>

      <p>The vaccine is available for free to asthmatics who use preventer medicine, have been on a course of oral or systemic steroids or who have been previously hospitalised because of their condition.</p>
      <p>Anyone who is not eligible can be assessed on a case-by-case basis by their GP or pay privately for a jab from their local surgery or pharmacy.</p>
      <p>Previous research by Asthma UK suggests people put off getting the vaccine because they are worried about side effects or are sceptical about its effectiveness.</p>
      <p>Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP and the clinical lead at Asthma UK, said: ‘Asthma and flu can be a potentially lethal combination, and the flu vaccine is the best way to prevent someone falling ill.</p>

      <p>‘Flu can make people’s asthma symptoms worse and trigger a life-threatening asthma attack.</p>
      <p>‘People with asthma are also at higher risk of developing other serious flu-related complications as the flu can make their asthma symptoms worse.’</p>
