      <p>Cape Town - The<b> European Tour</b> season is set for a thrilling finale with five players still in line to claim the jackpot at this week's <b>DP World Tour Championship</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Bernd Wiesberger</b>, <b>Tommy Fleetwood</b>,<b> Jon Rahm</b>, <b>Shane Lowry</b> and <b>Matt Fitzpatrick</b> are all still in with a chance of claiming the Race to Dubai title and earning the $2 million bonus prize, while the season finale itself has a top prize of $3 million to the winner.</p>
      <p>Race to Dubai leader Bernd Wiesberger obviously finds himself in the strongest position with just one tournament to play, but if he has a bad week it will open the door for his closest pursuers.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood would need a solo third or better; Rahm would need a two-way tie for second or better; Lowry would need a solo second or better; while Fitzpatrick would need to win the title.</p>
      <p>As for Wiesberger, if he finishes solo second he will walk away with the jackpot regardless of who claims the trophy.</p>
      <p>After skipping the Nedbank Challenge, Open champion Lowry dropped down to fourth in the standings, but a win in Dubai this weekend would still see him claim the double prize, and even a sole runner-up finish would still give him the chance to claim the order of merit title, depending on how the other contenders finish up.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood's <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Golf/NedbankChallenge/fleetwood-prevails-in-thrilling-sun-city-playoff-20191117">win in Sun City on Sunday</a> has allowed the Englishman to leapfrog into second place.</p>
      <p>"The closer it gets to the end of the season, the harder it is to stay in the present, do your things and concentrate on what you do best. I'm happy for the challenge, feel like I am ready," he said.</p>
