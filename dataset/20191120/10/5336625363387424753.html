      <h1>How to track your period with an iPhone or Apple Watch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/brenda-stolyar/" target="_blank">Brenda Stolyar</a></address>
      <p>I can confidently say there are few things worse than when your period hits unexpectedly, especially in public. Without fail, it always goes the same way for me: slight panic ensues; the hunt for a tampon begins; and then I constantly check my pants in the mirror for blatant leakage. With Apple's Cycle Tracking app, those days are (hopefully) behind me.</p>
      <p>Sure, there are plenty of period-tracking apps available, but who wants to add yet <i>another</i> app to their phone? I'm gonna say no one. If you've got an iPhone, then good news: Apple's Cycle Tracking app is already included with iOS 13, and comes with all the features necessary for your period tracking needs. </p>
      <p>By logging your information on a monthly basis (have no fear, Apple says it doesn't sell your data to third parties), the app predicts when your next period is supposed to start, and sends alerts to your devices. Whether it's mid-workday or mid-vacation, it also helps you avoid any unwelcome surprise visits. </p>
      <p>Here's how to make it work for you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Locate the Cycle Tracking app</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don't be alarmed if you don't see the Cycle Tracking app on your phone. As long as you're on iOS 13, it's definitely in there. Apple tucked it into the the Health app, so it takes a few taps to find. Open the app, tap Browse, and you'll see the Cycle Tracking tab underneath Body Measurements. If you have the <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/apple-watch-series-5-review/">Apple Watch</a> (Series 1 or later), watchOS 6 comes with a handy-dandy dedicated app icon, that you can tap on instead. </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Log your history</b>
      </p>
      <p>In order for the app to better predict your next period, you'll have to manually enter when your last period started, how many days it lasted, and the length of your cycle. But, if you're already using a third-party tracking app like Glow or Clue that's compatible with the Health app, then you'll be asked to simply confirm whether or not your information is correct.</p>

        <figcaption>Can't remember your last cycle? Just start from scratch. <br/>Image: SCREENSHOT OF CYCLE TRACKING APP / MASHABLE</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But don't sweat it if you have zero recollection or start overthinking the dates.You can skip this part altogether and start from scratch instead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Set up your notifications</b>
      </p>
      <p>There's nothing like multiple (and sometimes annoying) push notifications to remind you to log your period. It's also a great way to keep from messing up all that data you've worked <i>so</i> hard to compile.</p>
      <p>With Cycle Tracking, you can toggle on alerts for Period Predictions, which pulls information like the length of your period and average cycle, to remind you that your next period is on its way, and to log it in the app when it starts. </p>
      <p>There's also an option for Period Notifications. When turned on, you'll receive a notification the evening before your period is set to begin. And, as if the app doesn't do this enough, it'll remind you to log the start date.</p>
      <p>Fertility notifications are similar. You can toggle on Fertile Window Predictions to notify you when your fertile window is about to begin. Meanwhile, the Fertile Window Notifications alert you the night before your window is approaching. You also have the option to manually log your own fertility data with information like ovulation test results, sexual activity, and your basal body temperature.</p>
      <p>Of course, if the possibility of someone glancing at your phone and seeing when your next period is supposed to begin makes you panic, turning off notifications is easy. Simply go to the <b>Health &gt; Browse &gt; Options</b> and toggle off the alerts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Track by color</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Pro tip: Just remember the red circles mean period blood. <br/>Image: SCREENSHOT OF CYCLE TRACKING APP / MASHABLE</figcaption>

      <p>Apple uses a color-coded system to represent what stage your menstrual cycle is in. I found these to be a bit confusing at first but, with time, it's easy to get used to. </p>
      <p>As you can see above, red stripes on a circle indicate when your period is predicted to start, while solid red represents your logged period days. Purple dots are used to show that you logged information, like symptoms or period flow. Light blue ovals appear when your six-day fertile window is predicted to start.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> <b>Log your period on your iPhone or Apple Watch</b></p>
      <p>So, your period has arrived, now what? If you guessed that it's time to log it, you've clearly been paying close attention. </p>
      <p>Tap on Cycle Tracking, scroll to the exact day your period started, and tap on the red circle to log it. The same steps apply when tracking it on the Apple Watch as well.</p>

        <figcaption>Be honest about your flow. It's a safe space. <br/>Image: SCREENSHOT OF CYCLE TRACKING APP / MASHABLE</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Underneath, you can add additional information to your Cycle Log. So, anything from your flow level to any symptoms you were feeling that day including appetite changes, cramps, headaches, lower back pain, and more go here. If you want to get super detailed, there is also the option to add your cervical mucus quality, and your body temperature.</p>
      <p>Cycle Tracking also allows you to retroactively log past periods. Tap "Add Period" in the upper right-hand corner of the app, select the start and end date of your period, and then tap "Done" to save the data. </p>
      <p>And, since we're on the topic of cycle tracking and fertility, I feel slightly obligated to address the elephant in the room. Unless you're <i>literally trying</i> <i>to make a baby</i>, this app should in no way, shape, or form, be used as a form of contraception. Stay safe out there, folks.</p>
