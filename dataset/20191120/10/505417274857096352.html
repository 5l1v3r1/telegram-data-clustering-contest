        <b>German champions Bayern Munich are reportedly interested in signing Tottenham and Ireland striker Troy Parrott with the 17-year-old catching the club’s eye thanks to his standout performances over the past year.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703739/Bayern-Munich-prepare-shock-Tottenham-striker-Troy-Parrott-eye-Dean-Henderson-swoop.html">According to The Daily Mail,</a> Bayern are eyeing up the English market in an attempt to find a potential coup, in a similar style to how fellow Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund signed Jadon Sancho from Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The club are set to be monitoring his situation with Parrott’s current contract at Tottenham expiring in 2021 meaning he is currently not tied down to a long term deal.</p>

      <p>Parrott has been impressing this season as he finds himself on the fringes of the Tottenham first team, making his senior debut in the League Cup against Colchester while continuing his prolific goalscoring form for the club at underage level.</p>
      <p>He has also become a senior Irish international making the successful step up from U21 level starting in last week’s 3-1 victory over New Zealand in addition to being included in the 23-man squad for the Euro 2020 qualifier against Denmark.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old was clearly very highly rated at Tottenham by now former manager Mauricio Pochettino who put a lot of trust in the young striker but it will be interesting to see how his career in North London develops now <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/jose-mourinho-confirmed-as-new-tottenham-head-coach/">with Jose Mourinho in charge.</a></p>

      <p>Mourinho has often been a manager who has prioritised winning now over developing younger players and using club’s academies, which could lead to Parrott feeling his career is better suited elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The report also outlines that Bayern are interested in bringing Sheffield United’s on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson to the club as a potential long-term replacement for current number one Manuel Neuer.</p>
