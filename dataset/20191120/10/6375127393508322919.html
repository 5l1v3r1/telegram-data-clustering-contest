      <p>A PHILIPPINE National Police official has recently told international counter-terrorism experts the need for all nations to be on guard against the growing threats posed by determined terrorists using various types of improvised explosives (IEDs) to inflict the most damage on innocent targets.</p>
      <p>“There is really a big need for all countries to be wary of the evolving and emerging threats posed by terrorists across the globe, not only here in the country. I’m referring to the need for security forces to be aware of the possibility of threats posed by drone-borne, animal-borne and sea-borne IEDs as well as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosives which really have the capability to inflict mass destruction,” Lieutenant Colonel Hansel M. Marantan, the head of the Philippine Bomb Data Center in Camp Crame told the Journal Group.</p>
      <p>The official spoke during the Global Congress on Chemical Security and Emerging Threats at Lyons, France hosted by Interpol’s General Secretariat last October 28-31.</p>
      <p>“If no significant and decisive interventions and measures will be undertaken by stakeholders, the future of the next generation would really be in peril,” he said.</p>
      <p>During the Lyons conference, participants from the Interpol, the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security and Defense Threat Reduction Agency underscored the importance of partnership building in order to address emerging threats.</p>
      <p>Given the increasingly sophisticated methods and technologies being used by terrorists,  Marantan batted for much tougher counter-terror actions and legislations including one which will strictly regulate the sale of SIM cards and drones in the country.</p>
      <p>Also speaking before a Cebu forum, the official particularly mentioned the need to study threats posed by drone IEDs compared to ‘suicide bombers.’</p>
      <p>“It takes a lot of time to radicalize a potential suicide bomber and it’s also too expensive since they have to take care of the family needs of their understudy. Compared it to a drone which is much cheaper. A drone-IED is as good as a suicide bomber or a vehicle-borne IED,” he said.</p>
      <p>Marantan gave his audience an overview of the extent of IED attacks in the country specifically in Mindanao particularly on how foreign and local terrorists used IEDs to spread fear, chaos and destruction.</p>
      <p>According to the official, different threat groups have already shifted their simple bomb design to a much more complex structure.</p>
      <p>“If we look at the global IED incidents with terrorists using sophisticated methods of employment, The Philippines should be prepared to counter these emerging threats,” he said.</p>
      <p>He cited the relationship of Southern Philippines-based terrorists specifically the Abu Sayyaf and the Ansar Khilafa al Islamiyah with so-called ‘foreign terrorist fighters’ or FTFs to threaten the landscape in Mindanao.</p>
      <p>FTFs’ influence, Marantan said has affected the trend in Mindanao and actually could cause a greater problem in the future. He also cited major terror attacks in the world since last year, the most recent and brutal of which is the September 14 drone attack at the Aramco oil production facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia which caused oil prices to shoot up in the country.</p>
      <p>Historically, he said that the first recorded foreign terrorist to influence Southern Philippines-based terror groups was Dr. Azahari Husin, a Malaysian explosives expert and member of the Al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah.</p>
      <p>Husin was described as the ‘technical mastermind’ behind the 2002 bombing in Bali, Indonesia which killed 245 people, many of them Westerners and wounded 209 others.</p>
      <p>Records showed that Husin went on to train his students in Afghanistan and Mindanao in the late 1990s after developing a passion for making powerful bombs. He was killed in a shootout with Indonesian policemen on November 9, 2005.</p>
      <p>Husin was followed in the early 2000 by Jemaah Islamiyah member Father Rohman Al-Ghozi, an Indonesian explosives expert who underwent military training at an Al-Qaeda camp in the Afghan-Pakistani border.</p>
      <p>Al-Ghozi admitted helping plan and finance a series of bombings in the country including the infamous December 30, 2000 ‘Rizal Day’ bombings that killed 22 innocent people and wounded more than 100.</p>
      <p>The once notorious JI bomb-maker who was also linked to a number of deadly terror attacks in Indonesia and Singapore was known to have used a fake Philippine passport in 2001 when he went to Singapore to activate a JI cell whose main purpose is to target American and other Western targets.</p>
      <p>He was arrested by Philippine authorities on January 15, 2002 and gave information that led in the recovery of more than a ton of explosives and other bomb-making materials in General Santos City. However, he escaped from the PNP Custodial Center in Camp Crame on July 14, 2003 triggering a nationwide manhunt which ended when he was killed in a gunbattle with the police in Cotabato three months later.</p>
