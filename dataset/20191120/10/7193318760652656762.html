      <p>The National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum will host the "Kids Take Over the Cowboy: Holidays at the Museum" event from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Dec. 7.</p>
      <p>Children can celebrate the season with Santa in Prosperity Junction, a turn-of-the-century frontier town, where youngsters will make Western-inspired ornaments, pine cone birdfeeders, Christmas tree decorations and more at various ornament and craft stations. Also, visitors can sample frontier food with cowboy cornbread and a cup of sarsaparilla and be on the lookout for Howe and Dee the Cowboy Elves to earn a special badge.</p>
      <p>A scavenger hunt will spur children to discover and interact with a cast of Western characters, including Sacajawea, Teddy Roosevelt, Abraham Lincoln, Annie Oakley and more. Kids will be able to “interview” the characters to answer questions to complete their scavenger hunt sheet. They also will roam the galleries discovering art and history, while looking for answers or performing tasks related to a particular piece of art or object. Once they’ve answered all of the questions, each child will receive a letter stamp in their Scavenger Hunt sheet. When they have collected all of the letters, they can then unscramble them to reveal the mystery word and earn a prize.</p>
      <p>Santa will be in the lobby for those wanting to take their own photos and drop off your holiday wish lists. There will also be face painting, and the Zoomobile will have several Western wildlife animals available for viewing.</p>
      <p>Activities will be free with museum admission or museum membership.</p>
