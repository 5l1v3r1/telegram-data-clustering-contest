      <p>Loss-making <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Norwegian+Air">Norwegian Air</a> has appointed a new chief executive to take charge of the budget carrier’s ongoing restructuring, the board said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jacob+Schram">Jacob Schram</a>, who joins Norwegian from being an advisor at McKinsey, replaces <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Bjoern+Kjos">Bjoern Kjos</a>, the company’s founder who stepped down in July after building the carrier into Europe’s third-largest budget airline.</p>
      <p>Mr Schram, 57, led the process in 2010 to list Statoil’s petrol station business, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Statoil">Statoil</a> Fuel and Retail, later acquired by Canada’s Couche-Tard to become <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Circle+K">Circle K</a>.</p>
      <p>“His extensive management experience from global companies, proven leadership skills, strong commercial consumer orientation and impressive track record of value creation will greatly benefit Norwegian as the company enters into a new phase,” board Chairman <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Niels+Smedegaard">Niels Smedegaard</a> said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Since July, Norwegian has been run on an interim basis by chief financial officer <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Geir+Karlsen">Geir Karlsen</a>, who has raised cash, postponed debt payments, sold off assets and cut unprofitable routes to keep the company alive.</p>
      <p>Mr Karlsen will now continue as chief financial officer as well as deputy chief executive. – Reuters</p>
