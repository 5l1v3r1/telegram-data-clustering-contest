      </figure>
      <p>It is the £115million question creeping up on Newcastle United – a contract number cruncher that will define the future direction of the club.</p>
      <p>For all that January is an important transfer window for Lee Charnley, the biggest decisions the club must make are on how many of the 20 players whose deals are entering their final 18 months they will keep.</p>
      <p>Newcastle have eight players at the end of their contracts this summer – arguably three they’ll want to either keep or sell next in January to prevent a significant loss of transfer revenue – and then a further 12 in the close season of 2021, which is a potentially transformative period for the Magpies.</p>
      <p>While Jack Colback – exiled from the Premier League squad – now seems certain to end on the free agent market, the 2020 crop also includes Federico Fernandez, Andy Carroll, Ki and Matty Longstaff. All big players or potential future stars.</p>
      <p>And the 2021 group includes a collective who have been absolutely critical for the club in recent seasons: DeAndre Yedlin, Isaac Hayden, Matt Ritchie, Jonjo Shelvey, Dwight Gayle, Ciaran Clark and arguably the club’s most valuable defender Fabian Schar.</p>
      <p>Although it looks like they have 19 months to decide on that crop, it’s more like six if the club are going to avoid haemorrhaging value in this crop of saleable players.</p>
      <p>Transfer value depreciates hugely in the final 12 to six months of a player’s contract and we might just be reaching the point where if Newcastle are to sell one of those 12, this is the last point at which they can collect premium value.</p>
      <p>In the case of Dwight Gayle, that’s <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/exclusive-dwight-gayle-fight-newcastle-16725025">why Newcastle were prepared to sell him to West Brom just before deadline day in Augus</a> t. United had lined up a loan deal with an agreement of a permanent, £15million switch if the Baggies were promoted.</p>

      <h3>Newcastle United's huge player overhaul</h3>
      <p>Newcastle United have 20 players out of contract by the end of 2021 - and one loan player to make a decision on.</p>
      <p>That includes six of the players who started the last match against Bournemouth, along with Matty Longstaff - who played for England's under-20s last night - and the injured Matt Ritchie, a strong contender to start when he recovers from an ankle problem.</p>
      <h3>2020</h3>
      <p>Ki £5.4m, Carroll £5.4m, Fernandez £6.3m, Manquillo £4.5m, Elliot £900k, Darlow £3.1m, Longstaff £5m, Colback £2.7m</p>
      <p>Also out of contract: Jetro Willems (loan)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Total values: £33.3m</b>
      </p>
      <h3>2021</h3>
      <p>Saivet £900k, Murphy £4m, Lazaar £900k, Aarons £450k, Atsu £5.4m, Yedlin £7.2m, Hayden £9m, Gayle £13.5m, Ritchie £10.8, Shelvey £13.5m, Schar £11m, Clark £5.4m</p>
      <p>
        <b>Total values: £82.05m</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Total value across two transfer window: £115.35m</b>
      </p>
      <p>* All values from Transfermarkt</p>

      <p>But Gayle was savvy enough to know the pendulum would swing in his favour in the coming months. He preferred a permanent deal to know what the future holds – and a Premier League chance – and informed West Brom he’d be waiting on his options in January and beyond (while attempting to breakthrough at Newcastle).</p>
      <p>Agents and players are fully aware that the power is with them in the final 12 months of their contracts and for a club like Newcastle, where the mantra seems to be selling savvy can boost the transfer fund, getting these calls right is crucial.</p>
      <p>The word in agents circles is that teams think the likes of Ritchie, Shelvey and Gayle are “gettable” for the right price. Newcastle might decide differently – but whether they’ll offer bigger, longer deals to players close to 30 is far from straightforward.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-martin-dubravka-contract-17139220">Martin Dubravka got his six-year deal of course</a> , but goalkeepers might represent a special case. Will either Ritchie or Shelvey – who would command eight figure fees in January or the summer – get the same long-term reward?</p>
      <p>United must now decide whether to stick or twist on the foundations they’ve built since returning to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>On the one hand there will be a temptation in the corridors of power to press renew, as they did in the summer of 2011 when big decisions were taken to sell Joey Barton and Kevin Nolan to integrate the likes of Yohan Cabaye and Demba Ba. That sparked the fifth-placed finish which remains the best return under Mike Ashley.</p>
      <p>But by doing this, they could upset the chemistry of a team whose character has been such a hallmark of recent seasons. Players like Ritchie and Clark, whose patience as a squad player shouldn’t be underestimated, will not be easily replaced by younger players without the force of personality that they possess.</p>
      <p>Rafa Benitez was understood to be in favour of selling some of that group of 12, but pulled back because he didn’t trust the club to re-invest the money properly or at all. Charnley has bristled at those suggestions in the past but it could be put to the test in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>It is a huge decision.</p>
