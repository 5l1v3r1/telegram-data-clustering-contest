      <h1>AMD's Radeon Pro W5700 brings RDNA to the workstation world</h1>
      <h2>7nm GPU is also first to offer USB-C</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:51:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/3180/roland-moore-colyer" target="_blank">Roland Moore-Colyer</a></address>
      <p><b>AMD HAS TAKEN</b> the covers off its first 7-nanometre professional-grade workstation graphics card, dubbed the Radeon Pro W5700.</p>
      <p>It sports 36 compute units, 8GB of GDDR6 video memory, with a 256-bit memory interface and a bandwidth of 448GB/s, and delivers a total of 8.89 TFLOPS, the graphics card looks to be quite a pixel pusher.</p>
      <p>In many ways, the Radeon Pro W5700 is effectively a professional take on <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3076357/amd-computex-navi-ryzen-3000-official">the consumer-grade Radeon RX 5700</a>, though its software is more work rather than pleasure-orientated.</p>
      <p>It's aimed at chewing on enterprise-grade software and dealing with the types of graphically-demanding workloads of 3D designers, engineers, and architects, rather than running the latest games at 4K and 60 frames per second.</p>
      <p>Tapping into AMD's latest RDNA graphics architecture, the Radeon Pro W5700 promises 25 per cent higher performance-per-clock and 41 per cent higher average performance-per-watt over Pro predecessors using Team Red's old Graphics Core Next architecture.</p>
      <p>AMD noted it has tweaked the drivers for the Radeon Pro W5700 for workflow performance, and it also has a USB-C connector; AMD claims it's the first workstation graphics card to have one. That should help it connect to high-end monitors that support video input over USB-C, as well as head-mounted displays.</p>
      <p>"We designed the AMD Radeon Pro W5700 to deliver significant performance gains in top design and manufacturing applications. Architects, designers and engineers now have the horsepower to drive demanding real-time and VR experiences, enabling a better and faster design creation process," spouted Scott Herkelman, corporate vice president and general manager of the Radeon Technologies Group at AMD.</p>
      <p>The Radeon Pro W5700 is on sale now and will cost $799 (around £618). We expect to see it pop up in pre-built workstations from the likes of Dell, HP, and Lenovo, as well as being an option for custom-built machines aimed at folks who work with 3D software.</p>
      <p>This all shows AMD is keen to push RDNA of to professionals as well as Team Red enthusiasts, which is great for the company, <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3080398/amd-navi-23-leak-nvidia-killer-ray-tracing-2020">but we're still waiting on a true killer graphics card from the company</a>. µ</p>
