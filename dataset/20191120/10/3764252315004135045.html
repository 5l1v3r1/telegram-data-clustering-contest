      <h1>Microsoft releases Windows 10 20H1 Build 19028</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:34:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://betanews.com/author/waynewill1/" target="_blank">Wayne Williams</a></address>
      <p>Now that the Windows 10 November 2019 Update is <a href="https://betanews.com/2019/11/19/windows-10-update-assistant-november-2019-update/">widely available</a>, Microsoft’s attention is firmly on the next feature release, due out next year.</p>
      <p>The latest builds on the 20H1 branch haven’t introduced any new features, instead the focus has been firmly on fixing problems and making improvements.</p>
      <p>In Build 19028, the changes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a recent issue that could result in Settings crashing when docking/undocking your device. This issue may have also impacted Action Center launch performance.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue impacting the performance of the Printers &amp; Scanners section of Settings loading.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue resulting in the Other People section under Storage Settings not displaying the correct size used.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that could result in Windows Update history in Settings saying a Cumulative Update required a reboot, despite it already being installed. This occurred when a Feature on Demand had installed while the cumulative update was originally pending reboot.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that could result in the Photos app crashing when interacting with HEVC images.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Known issues are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, Microsoft has applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details</a>.</li>
        <li>Microsoft is looking into reports of the update process hanging for extended periods of time when attempting to install a new build.</li>
        <li>Microsoft has heard that Settings still isn’t available outside of launching via the URI (ms-settings:) for some Insiders and is investigating.</li>
        <li>Some Insiders are reporting that after successfully installing printer drivers from the Optional Updates section, the same driver is still showing as available for install.</li>
        <li>Microsoft is looking into reports of certain external USB 3.0 drives not responding with Start Code 10 or 38 after they’re attached.</li>
      </ul>
