      <p>The nearly 100-year-old Harajuku Station, sited in a hub of Tokyo pop culture, will be dismantled and rebuilt after the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, as its fire-resistance capability does not meet requirements, East Japan Railway Co. said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Western-style wooden station building, completed in 1924, is a gateway to the Harajuku district — a center of youth culture and street fashion. JR East said the new station will replicate as much as possible the current design, which features half-timbered structures that expose the building’s framework.</p>
      <p>The area sees daily crowds of overseas tourists visiting Takeshita Street, a shopping lane lined with clothing stores and cafes, among other shops.</p>
      <p>Aside from rebuilding the current station building, JR East also began constructing a new building in September 2016 located south of the current station that is set to open on March 21 next year, taking over station functions.</p>
      <p>The train operator had been discussing whether to preserve or dismantle the present station building together with Shibuya Ward, where the station is located, and other parties.</p>
