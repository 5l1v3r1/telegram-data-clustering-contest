      <h1>ECB: Record-low rates causing 'excessive risk-taking' in some sectors</h1>

      <p>Record-low interest rates in the Eurozone have led to “excessive risk-taking in some sectors” as financial firms pursue profits, the European Central Bank (ECB) has warned.</p>
      <p>The ECB defended low rates in its latest financial stability report, however, saying they were necessary to support economic activity in the struggling Eurozone.</p>
      <p>“While the low interest rate environment supports the overall economy, we also note an increase in risk-taking which warrants continuous and close monitoring”, said Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB.</p>
      <p>“Authorities should use available tools to address the build-up of vulnerabilities where possible.”</p>
      <p>The ECB warned that non-banks such as investment funds, insurance companies and pension funds have taken on more risk in response to low interest rates, which limit the amount of money that can be earned from bonds.</p>
      <p>“In the event of a sudden repricing of financial assets, growing credit and liquidity risk in some parts of the euro area non-bank financial sector… may lead non-banks to respond in ways that cause stress to spread to the wider financial system,” the ECB’s report said.</p>
