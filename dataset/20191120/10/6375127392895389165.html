      <h3>SENATOR Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go said that he supports the Supreme Court (SC) ruling to uphold Section 32 of the Republic Act (RA) 9173 or the “Philippine Nursing Act of 2002” which states that “the minimum base pay of nurses working in public health institutions shall not be lower than salary grade 15.”</h3>
      <p>“Importante po sa atin ang mga nurses at suportado natin ang kanilang pagkapanalo sa Supreme Court,” Go said on  Tuesday during the Senate plenary deliberations on the 2020 budget of the Department of Health (DOH).</p>
      <p>However, Go said that the ruling has not been taken into consideration yet in the proposed 2020 budget of the Health Department because the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and the DoH are still studying the needed appropriation for it.</p>
      <p>“DBM and DoH are still studying the needed appropriation to implement the decision,” Go said.</p>
      <p>Go mentioned that the implementation of the High Court ruling will cost around PhP3.17 billion annually based on the existing salary schedule.</p>
      <p>“We need your cooperation to implement the decision and address the possible wage distortion brought about by the Supreme Court decision,” Go said, adding that he will prioritize the passage of a new Salary Standardization Law (SSL) which will provide for the increase of the current salaries of government nurses and other workers.</p>
      <p>“For now, uunahin muna natin ang Salary Standardization 5 in which kasama ang mga nurses at meron na pong pwedeng pagkukunan ng pondo,” Go said.</p>
      <p>Go filed in July Senate Bill (SB) 200 or the proposed “Act Modifying the Salary Schedule for Civilian Government Personnel” which seeks to increase the salaries of all government workers, including nurses and teachers.</p>
