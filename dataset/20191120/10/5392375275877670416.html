      <p>Nokia announced that it has signed a 5G commercial contract with New Zealand operator, Spark, to become its preferred 5G supplier. <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/nokia-5g">Nokia 5G</a> technology will help Spark build faster, lower latency and higher bandwidth 5G networks in New Zealand. As a SRAN RAN equipment provider, Nokia will deploy AirScale RAN solutions at more than 200 sites.

      <p>Nokia and Spark have long-term relationships in various fields such as IP, fiber and wireless networks. The company will help New Zealand to firmly grasp the 5G opportunities and benefit from the fast-growing digital economy and applications. Currently, the company is actively working with Spark on 5G deployments at five sites. They will be ready before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>To date, Nokia has signed 50 5G commercial contracts worldwide, demonstrating strong growth momentum. The contract covers many early 5G operators and 16 of them are currently commercial.</p>
      <p>Rajesh Singh, general manager of value management at Spark New Zealand, said that we are happy to continue working with Nokia to build a 5G network for New Zealand. The two teams have extensive cooperation on 5G solutions and have good results in both RAN and end-to-end networks.</p>
      <p>In addition, Nokia Mobile Network President, Tommi Uitto, said the company will help Spark build 5G networks in its core business areas. “Our commitment is to help New Zealand stay at the forefront of technology. Nokia’s global reach, expertise, and agility will help New Zealand achieve better growth in the 5G era”.</p>
