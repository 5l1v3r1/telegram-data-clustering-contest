      <h1>Our verdict on Yungblud at Bristol's O2 Academy – review and setlist</h1>
      <h2>'There’s no doubt Dominic Harrison has created something quite special'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:19:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:19</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Yungblud would have to blow it pretty spectacularly now if he is to miss out on the huge global stardom that is within touching distance of his black nail-varnished fingertips.</p>
      <p>The androgynous 22-year-old Yorkshireman may have a speaking voice like a minor character from Last of the Summer Wine (pre-fame, he did actually appear in an episode of Emmerdale as a teenager) and he might have a taste for grotesque make-up and women’s clothes but there’s no doubt Dominic Harrison has created something quite special and the kids can’t get enough.</p>
      <p>Stopping off in Bristol on a sell-out tour of some of the UK’s largest venues, there was a clear sense that this time next year he’ll only be playing arenas and stadiums.</p>
      <p>After all, Yungblud’s rise has already been meteoric and he was playing Bristol’s tiny Thekla only 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>The sweary lad from Doncaster with 1.6million Instagram followers epitomises the modern-day pop icon and it’s not hard to see why he teenagers love him. Many had started queuing outside at 8am even though the doors didn’t open until 7pm.</p>
      <p>For anybody too young to remember David Bowie, John Lydon, Morrissey and even Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, Yungblud must be the most exciting thing they’ve ever seen on stage.</p>
      <p>With his black spiky hair, Robert Smith-style lipstick, pink socks and see-through mesh top, Yungblud certainly looks different and his energy levels are exhausting - he simply didn’t stop running around the stage, jumping, dancing, singing and playing guitars for more than 90 minutes in a hot and steamy venue where security staff had to deal with several teenage girls passing out in the heat.</p>

      <p>Musically, Yungblud is a bubbling melting pot of just about every musical style of the past 50 years. There are heavy metal guitar riffs, bouncing hip-hop beats, floor-rumbling drum and bass rhythms and plenty of punk attitude - often all of those references in the same song.</p>
      <p>He has the swagger of Liam Gallagher, the rebelliousness of John Lydon and the crazed demeanour of the Prodigy’s Keith Flint. He's intoxicating to watch.</p>
      <p>Most of the set was based around his singles, EPs and the album 21st Century Liability, and the 2,000 young fans (and even the parents waiting at the back) knew every word to every song.</p>
      <p>Of course, none of the spectacle or showmanship would matter if the lyrics and vocals aren’t strong but they are.</p>
      <p>Yungblud has said that his songs are for “today’s misunderstood youth growing up in confusion, anxiety and fear” and he’s not afraid to write about gun violence, politics and depression.</p>
      <p>The strength of his vocals came to the fore on the rare slow songs like Waiting on the Weekend and Casual Sabotage, for which he sat down with an acoustic guitar.</p>
      <p>Apart from these, the set was a frenzied, high energy blizzard of strobes and teenage angst anthem singalongs like I Love You Will You Marry Me, Anarchist, California, Loner, Parents and Original Me with its repetitive chorus of ‘Some days I wish I was anyone else, I’m the original loser’.</p>
      <p>Halfway through the set, the band left the stage and the lights dimmed. For a split second, it looked like the gig had finished prematurely until the wailing sound of police sirens. A spotlight aimed at the side fire exit suddenly revealed security guards pushing their way through the crowd with Yungblud disguised in a hoodie as he walked to the centre of the crowd to perform Kill Somebody surrounded by stunned fans.</p>

      <p>The sudden realisation that their idol had just brushed past them resulted in several girls bursting into tears just like in those grainy black and white clips of hyperventilating Beatles fans back in the 60s.</p>
      <p>A frenetic encore of Braindead!, Hope for the Underrated Youth and Machine Gun (F**k the NRA) ended with a sweat-drenched Yungblud telling the crowd that he would be around the back in 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>In normal circumstances, most stars might say that and be safely in a limo or on the tour coach before fans had even left the venue but around 1,000 fans were waiting in the cold as I left the building.</p>
      <p>Clearly a man of his word who genuinely loves and wallows in his growing adoration, their patience was soon rewarded as he emerged to deafening screams which you could easily hear from the Centre.</p>
      <p>I’m not sure if Emily Eavis had made the short journey from Pilton to check him out but if she’s looking for a headliner for next year’s Glastonbury, she doesn’t have to look much beyond Yungblud whose star is now firmly in the ascendent.</p>
      <p>Yungblud is the most relevant British singer of the moment and he speaks directly to the next generation of music fans, who hang on his every word. There simply seems to be no stopping him now.</p>
