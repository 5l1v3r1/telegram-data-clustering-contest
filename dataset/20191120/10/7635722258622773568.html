      <h1>Phil Egan: What can Tottenham expect from Mourinho</h1>

        <b>Jose Mourinho is back in football management after 11 months out of the game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss had been working in the Sky Sports studio but Tottenham have decided Mourinho is the man to turn to things around.</p>
      <p>Last season's beaten Champions League finalists have only won three of their opening 12 Premier League games and are already 11 points off fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>The writing was on the wall for Pochettino but the bigger surprise is the appointment of Mourinho.</p>
      <p>I think back to February 23rd earlier this year when Spurs went to Burnley with a chance to move within two points of Manchester City and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Spurs got themselves in that position without Harry Kane but he made his return to the starting 11 that day and scored at Turf Moor.</p>
      <p>However, it was a game the North London club lost and Pochettino lost it with referee Mike Dean.</p>
      <p>Spurs did of course go on to claim another top-four finish and a place in the Champions League final but it was quite evident this season that all was not well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What will Mourinho bring to Spurs?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho says he's "excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters."</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss also thinks there is "quality in both the squad and the academy."</p>
      <p>The word academy jumps out there given his track record of not bringing through young players.</p>
      <p>That could have a serious impact on the development of Republic of Ireland striker Troy Parrott.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have picked up just 25 points in their last 24 league games, so it won't be hard to improve on their poor form.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's appointment will divide opinions among Spurs supporters because his style of football has not always been easy on the eye.</p>
      <p>He won't be shy in reminding us of how many trophies he has won during his managerial career but there has been a notable dropoff in his success rate.</p>
      <p>He won a Premier League title with Chelsea as recently as 2015 and won the Europa League and League Cup with Manchester United in 2017.</p>
      <p>However, it can't be ignored how things ended for the 56-year-old at both clubs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"He wins trophies"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has won 20 major trophies during his career, 25 according to Tottenham's statement but are we counting the Community Shield as a major piece of silverware.</p>
      <p>Mourinho certainly is and will tell us he's won 25.</p>
      <p>Pochettino delivered Champions League football on a regular basis and was one win away from winning the competition in June of this year.</p>
      <p>Would Mourinho winning a League Cup or FA Cup be a great achievement for the club?</p>
      <p>Juande Ramos won the League Cup with Spurs in 2008 so does that mean he was more successful than Pochettino at the club? Absolutely not.</p>
      <p>Pochettino overachieved with Spurs but ultimately came up short at key times because they couldn't compete with their rivals in terms of wages and transfer fees.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is taking over a squad that contains wantaway players because they don't feel valued.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have gone from a manager who's worked on a modest budget and gives young players a chance to a manager who likes to spend money.</p>

      <p>It means Daniel Levy or Jose Mourinho will have to change their approach. It's hard to imagine Mourinho will rethink how he does things so it's up to Levy.</p>
      <p>Only time will tell if the Tottenham chairman is willing to give his new manager significant transfer funds and pay higher wages.</p>
      <p>If he does, the question will be asked, why didn't he give Pochettino that money? Why not trust the most successful manager at the club under Levy?</p>
      <p>Tottenham have several players who are unhappy and have appointed a manager that historically falls out with players, eventually.</p>
      <p>The reality of the situation is that Mourinho's stock has dropped so it was unlikely he would get a better offer in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has a short shelf life, meaning this will inevitably end in tears so if he's going to have any success at Tottenham, it will happen next season.</p>
