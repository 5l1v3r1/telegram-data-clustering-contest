      <p>There was mayhem in Harare today after the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) indiscriminately attacked civilians in the central business district. The police attacked civilians and opposition MDC supporters who had gathered at the Morgan Richard Tsvangirai (MRT) House, formerly Harvest House. The supporters had gathered to listen to Nelson Chamisa’s Hope of the Nation Address (HONA).</p>
      <p>However, in a well-coordinated attack, the police started savagely attacking everyone near Harvest House and Nelson Mandela Avenue a few minutes after Chamisa had arrived</p>
