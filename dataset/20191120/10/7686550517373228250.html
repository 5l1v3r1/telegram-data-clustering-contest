      <p>People who use Viagra are being warned about deadly fake versions of the drug being sold online.</p>
      <p>Pfizer, the company behind the erectile dysfunction treatment, warn there are many websites claiming to sell Viagra, but only around 20 per cent of these are genuine - counterfeits pills are illegal, and can also be unsanitary, toxic and even lethal.</p>
      <p>Ingredients found in these fake Viagra can include road paint, drywall, detergent, anti-fungal medication, talcum powder and amphetamines, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/warning-over-fake-viagra-could-3553360">report Plymouth Live.</a></p>
      <p>David Massie, registered pharmacist at Dr Andrews Online Pharmacy, said: "The number of dangerous things found in fake Viagra is staggering. The individuals behind the propagation of these counterfeit pills do not consider your health when producing them, only their profits.</p>
      <p>“When a doctor or pharmacist prescribes you Viagra, they consider all the other medications you might taking. Unlicensed sites are concerned only with their financial gain and not with drug interactions – mixing inappropriate medications together can often result in death.</p>

      <p>"At Dr Andrews, we encourage you to be vigilant in ensuring what you are taking is real, approved and regulated Viagra from a registered source.”</p>
      <p>Here are some ways to ensure what you have is the real deal:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It has smooth edges. Fake Viagra will have rough edges.</li>
        <li>Viagra only comes in packs of four. Any more than four pills to a pack are counterfeit.</li>
        <li>There should be no variations in colour. Viagra will always be solid blue.</li>
        <li>The f in Pfizer should not narrow until the top. In fake Viagra the ‘f’ narrows just past the letter ‘i’.</li>
        <li>A package without an expiration date or a poorly printed expiration date is a fake.</li>
        <li>Pfizer always have a hologram on the boxes. No hologram – not genuine.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have any doubts about the Viagra you received, do not use it - if you have taken what could be counterfeits, contact your doctor straight away.</p>
