        <b>Magical is one of five Aidan O'Brien-trained stars nominated for next month's Hong Kong international races.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was thought the career of the four-time Group One winner was over when she was forced to miss the Breeders' Cup after spiking a temperature.</p>
      <p>However, her name appeared among the likely runners for the Hong Kong Cup - where she will face Almond Eye - while stablemates Circus Maximus (Mile), Anthony Van Dyck and Mount Everest (Vase) and Magic Wand (Cup) are also in the mix on December 8.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted that the quality of the selected runners for this year's Longines Hong Kong International Races is in keeping with our long-held commitment to deliver sporting excellence," Hong Kong Jockey Club executive director of racing Andrew Harding told www.scmp.com.</p>
      <p>"Almond Eye's participation is particularly exciting when viewed in the context of the other world-class horses selected - champions of the calibre of Beauty Generation and Exultant, other global stars like Magical and the Derby winner Anthony Van Dyck, and the list is long and strong.</p>
      <p>"Factor in the potential of rising stars like Aethero, Waikuku and our Derby winner Furore and everything points to a thrilling afternoon of sport on December 8."</p>
      <p>Roger Charlton's Aspetar, Charlie Fellowes' Prince Of Arran and the William Haggas-trained Young Rascal are down to run in the Vase - while Sir Michael Stoute's Zaaki is in the Mile.</p>
