      <h1>Morrisons is giving away a free mince pie and hot drink to combat loneliness in the elderly</h1>
      <h2>It's hoped that the event will bring OAPs together so they can socialise</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:32:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:32</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, Sarah McGee</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is the season of giving and goodwill, which is why on December 3rd Morrisons is giving all OAPs a free drink and mince pie.</p>
      <p>All you need to do is visit a Morrisons cafe on this day between 2:30-5:30; simply ask staff about the offer and they can point you in the right direction.</p>
      <p>This deal was first found on the HotUKDeals Facebook page.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.facebook.com/315450463017/posts/10159775527518018?d=n&amp;sfns=mo">Security Check Required<br/></a>null</blockquote>
      <p>However, there's more to the idea than just bagging a freebie and tucking into a yummy mince pie.</p>
      <p>It's hope that the scheme can give pensioners the chance to interact and socialise, which is especially important if they're living alone.</p>

      <p>According to Age UK, loneliness in the elderly is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/loneliness/">Statistics</a> suggest that there are more than 2.2 million people aged 75 and over are liviing alone in the UK and 1.9 million older people say they feel ignored or invisible.</p>
      <p>It's not the first time Morrisons has launched a deal like this and the supermarket has also give away free hot cross buns and cups of tea in the past.</p>
      <p>Even if you're not a pensioner, you can still get your hands on some of Morrisons <a href="https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Morrisons-The-Best-Deep-Filled-Mince-Pies/427212011?utm_source=tradedoubler_Skimbit+UK&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;dclid=CP7n1MjC-OUCFRXi1QodJMMJ-g">The Best Deep Filled Mince Pies</a> which retail at Â£2.</p>
