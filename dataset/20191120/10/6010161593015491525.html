      <h1>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield TM List: every technical machine and where to find them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T10:55:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Donaldson</a></address>
      <p>As always, winning in battles in <b>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield</b> isn’t just determined by your choice of partner creature to battle with, but also your moves. To have access to the largest move pool possible, you’ll need to stock up on <b>TMs</b>, aka <b>Technical Machines</b> – and our TM List can help you out with that.</p>
      <p>Once you’ve found <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/pokemon-sword-shield-starter-pokemon-guide-starters-evolutions-abilities/">your perfect Pokemon starter</a> and picked the best of the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/18/pokemon-sword-shield-new-pokemon-pokedex-galarian-form-evolutions/">new Pokemon in Sword &amp; Shield</a>, you’ll then want to start aiming towards <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/18/pokemon-sword-shield-post-game-content/">the post-game</a>, where you’ll be filling out your Pokedex, taking on legendary Pokemon and hitting up online max raid battles. In order to be ready for that, you’ll need to carefully curate and select each Pokemon’s move set – and the best way to do that is through items that let you teach Pokemon all-new moves.</p>
      <p>As is series tradition, each Pokemon in the game learns a set suite of moves as they level up, with the player choosing what moves to delete and keep at any given time. Between this and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/pokemon-sword-shield-abilities-moves-new-list-attack/">Pokemon abilities</a>, this makes up the ‘natural’ move set of any given Pokemon. Beyond that, however, you can also use special items to teach Pokemon alternative moves, a great way to cover a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/15/pokemon-sword-shield-type-chart-strength-weakness-resistance/">type weakness</a> or the like.</p>
      <p>In Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield, these items take two forms: Technical Machines, aka TMs, and Technical Records, aka TRs. TMs work as they have in the past few Pokemon games – they’re unlimited-use items, so once you own it, you can teach that move to as many different Pokemon as many times as you like. TRs, meanwhile, are one-time use items, and are typically rewards in the Wild Area. On this page, we’ve got a comprehensive TM list for Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield detailing each and where to find them – so you can collect ’em all and use them to create a perfect move set.</p>
      <h3>Pokemon Sword &amp; Shield TM List</h3>
      <p>Here's every TM in Pokemon Sword and Shield - use these Technical Machines to teach new moves to your Pokemon. TMs can be used an unlimited number of times.</p>
