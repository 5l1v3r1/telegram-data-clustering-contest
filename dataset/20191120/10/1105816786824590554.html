      <p>The police also alleged that the ‘target killer’ was in communication with senior party leaders, including Dr Farooq Sattar and his first meeting with the senior party leader took place at Nine Zero – the then MQM headquarters.</p>
      <p>“The meeting was arranged by sector in-charge Khalid Siddiqui and Nadeem alias ‘Marble'”.</p>
      <p>The accused allegedly admitted to carrying out violent activities and murders at the behest of the MQM leadership.</p>
