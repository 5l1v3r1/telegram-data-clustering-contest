      <p>The pub was in the news last month when <a href="https://www.eadt.co.uk/1.6348973">an original Chairman Mao propaganda poster, part of a propaganda art collection, was stolen from the pub toilet,</a> and there was an attempt to steal a Julie Andrews poster from the disabled toilets.</p>

      <p>And earlier this year a speeding car skidded into the pub's outdoor planters, causing around £750 worth of damage and narrowly avoiding diners.</p>
