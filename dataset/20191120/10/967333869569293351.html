        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik) - A shortage of health professionals is a major impediment in handling the current health burden of India, especially in rural areas. Indian scientists have been working on affordable and innovative solutions for medical diagnosis.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A state-funded Indian scientific lab has now developed a smart microscopy solution for affordable <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201910231077130207-russian-scientists-develop-magnetic-sensor-for-non-contact-heart-diagnostics/">medical diagnostics</a>. The instrument developed by the Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) in northern Chandigarh can acquire microscopic images or use stored microscopic images of blood samples for real-time quantification of red blood cells and white blood cells.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is a telepathology based technique, which can be operated by any technician and the reports can be send to experts. It can be a very useful tool particularly for remote and inaccessible rural areas which lack diagnostic facilities", Dr Suman Tiwari, the lead researcher of the project told India Science Wire, a state-funded science news service.</blockquote>
      <p>This microscopy technique is based on a deep-learning algorithm. It uses mathematical formulations that can be used as a model for optimal outputs. The technique uses software that calculates red and white blood cells via microscopic images of blood samples.</p>
      <p>The existing methods are visual and manual but this technique would use an automated visual method. A microscope can be mounted on the newly developed instrument, which has a camera to acquire images. These images are then read by computers where the back-end algorithm can produce the results. In this approach, detection and quantification for RBC and subtypes of WBC has a 93 percent accuracy rate. The software can be loaded on a digital microscope developed by CSIO.</p>
      <p>"The system has been tested on data obtained from different clinical centres for lab-specific quantification. It can be developed as an integrated approach and automated solution for real-time quantification of blood cells in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201909251076883757-artificial-intelligence-can-diagnose-cancer-as-effectively-as-a-doctor---study/">diagnostic inference",</a> added Dr Tiwari.</p>
      <blockquote>"Limited access of equipment and experts for diagnostic testing of diseases to India's vast population and people living in remote areas is a major problem. This smart technology can be useful in ensuring access to affordable and accessible diagnostic services", said Professor R. Sinha, Director of CSIO.</blockquote>
