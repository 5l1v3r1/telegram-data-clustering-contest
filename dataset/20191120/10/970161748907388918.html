      <p>Titans season 2’s penultimate episode will see Hank in a whole new heap of trouble as someone takes over his life as he spirals out of control.</p>
      <p>The complicated vigilante, played by Alan Ritchson, has turned to cage-fighting for money to support his unhealthy habits as his violent nature gets the better of him.</p>
      <p>However, in new episode Faux-Hawk, he wakes up one day to find that someone has stolen his suit, and now there’s a new Hawk in town as an imposter takes his place.</p>
      <p>With a decision to make, Hank needs to get himself together in order to reclaim his title as the true Hawk of the DC Universe.</p>
      <p>He’s not the only one with troubles, as Donna (Conor Leslie) and Dawn (Minka Kelly) head out on a mission to find out more information about Gar (Ryan Potter) and Conner (Joshua Orpin).</p>

      <p>Heading to Cadmus, they meet a mysterious Cadmus operative (Raoul Bhaneja) in order to get information, but the Lex Luthor- run laboratories is about to start its Phase One plan.</p>
      <p>Which could be lethal, as it plans to experiment with Gar’s superhuman abilities.</p>

      <p>With only two episodes left of the season, and with no guarantee of season three, it could be anyone’s guess what’s to come for our heroes…</p>
