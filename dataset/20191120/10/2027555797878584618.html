      <p>The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought a response from the Enforcement Directorate on a plea filed by senior Congress leader P Chidambaram seeking bail in the INX Media money-laundering case.</p>
      <p>A three-judge bench headed by Justice R Banumathi issued a notice to the ED on Chidambaram's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court's November 16 verdict dismissing his bail plea in the case.</p>
      <p>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for ED, told the bench he would file a response by November 25.</p>
      <p>The bench, comprising Justices A S Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy, posted the matter for hearing on November 26.</p>
      <p>Senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Chidambaram, told the top court he should be granted bail as he is in custody for over three months.  </p>
