      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Verizon has finally published 5G coverage maps for the 18 cities where its 5G Ultra Wideband service is currently available.</li>
        <li>The largest carrier in the U.S. is planning to expand its 5G network to 30 cities before the end of the year.</li>
        <li>Earlier this week, Big Red had announced the expansion of its 5G network to Boston, Houston, and Sioux Falls.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nearly seven months after rolling out its 5G network in parts of Chicago and Minneapolis, Verizon is finally offering <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293382-11365093%3Fsid%3DUUacUdUnU82613YYw%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.verizonwireless.com%252F5g%252Fcoverage-map%252F&amp;token=At4DPbVY">5G coverage maps</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/372066/verizon-unveils-5g-coverage-maps"><i>PCMag</i></a>) for the 18 cities where its "ultra wideband" network is currently being offered. These new maps give users a detailed view of all the neighborhoods where they can find a 5G ultra wideband signal. While Verizon is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/verizon-teaming-boingo-bring-its-5g-ultra-wideband-service-indoors">working with Boingo</a> to get its <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/5g-verizon-everything-you-need-know">5G service</a> to work better indoors, the maps show that the carrier's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-every-us-city-5g-coverage-right-now">5G coverage</a> is currently limited to just the major streets in most cities.</p>

      <p>Rival carriers T-Mobile and Sprint, which are set to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-has-been-approved-fcc">merge</a> soon, already offer coverage maps for their 5G networks. AT&amp;T, which happens to be the second largest U.S. carrier after Verizon, is yet to provide its 5G services to regular customers. T-Mobile's 5G network is currently live in six cities, while Sprint is offering 5G services in nine.</p>
      <p>Verizon's 5G network is currently available in Atlanta, Boise, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, New York City, Omaha, Panama City, Phoenix, Providence, Sioux Falls, St. Paul, and Washington D.C. It plans to soon expand its 5G Ultra Wideband network to Cincinnati, Charlotte, Cleveland, Columbus, Des Moines, Kansas City, Little Rock, Memphis, Salt Lake City, and San Diego.</p>
