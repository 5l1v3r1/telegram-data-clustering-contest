      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/seth-meyers-netflix-special-donald-trump-jokes-skip-button/">Netflix</a> has long been establishing itself as the go-to place for stand-up comedy specials. In fact, it might lay claim to having the best ones around after dominating the Best Comedy Album category in this year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/07/stranger-things-netflix-grammy-nomination-quincy-star-wars/">Grammy</a> <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list">nominations.</a></p>
      <p>Efforts from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/04/ellen-degeneres-netflix-comedy-special-december-18/">Ellen DeGeneres</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/23/aziz-ansari-netflix-comedy-series/">Aziz Ansari</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/24/netflix-arrivals-november-house-of-cards-narcos/">Trevor Noah</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/15/netflix-dave-chappelle-stand-up-special-comedy/">Dave Chappelle</a> all made the cut. Jim Gaffigan was the other nominee for an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/amazon-william-gibson-the-peripheral-series/">Amazon Prime Video</a> special.</p>
      <p>Netflix has released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_original_stand-up_comedy_specials_distributed_by_Netflix">dozens and dozens</a> of stand-up specials since 2012. It's won this category for the last three years, with a trophy for Patton Oswalt in 2017 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/21/netflix-dave-chappelle-comedy-specials-2017/">a brace</a> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/22/netflix-will-unveil-two-dave-chappelle-specials-on-december-31st/">for Dave Chappelle</a> since. Amazon only recently got into the game after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/15/netflix-dave-chappelle-stand-up-special-comedy/">debuting its first specials in August.</a></p>
      <p>Other Netflix projects picked up nominations, including Beyoncé's <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/07/netflix-beyonce-coachella-documentary/">Homecoming</a> </i>documentary and the Thom Yorke/Paul Thomas Anderson film <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/20/thom-yorke-anima-netflix-musical-film/">Anima</a></i> in the Best Music Film category.

      <p>Elsewhere, John Williams picked up a Best Instrumental Composition nomination for "Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge Symphonic Suite." The track was inspired by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/11/disney-star-wars-rise-of-the-resistance-galaxys-edge/">new Star Wars theme parks</a> at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/27/star-wars-theme-park-ride-trailer/">Disneyland and Walt Disney World.</a></p>
