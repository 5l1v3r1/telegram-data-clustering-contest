      <p>MBOMBELA – Late last month numerous complaints were received from concerned citizens, who wish to stay anonymous for the fear of being victimised.</p>
      <blockquote>According to Albert Gryvenstein the operations manager at Bossies Community Justice (BCJ), the police are aware of the problem.” I have been there on various occasions with the Nelspruit police’s drug unit. Usually when we get there the alleged perpetrators have already gone.”</blockquote>
      <p>Eyewitness accounts describe how a person in a large silver Mercedes pulls up near to the entry to the soccer ball, where drug users are smoking illicit substances. He then gets their attention with a certain hand sign, before conducting the supposed drug deal.</p>

      <p>A drug squad veteran of Nelspruit’s (South African Police Services) SAPS revealed that although they are making frequent arrests, these drug peddlers obtain bail relatively easily and within a week they are back on the street. “It is tragic really, as most violent crimes can be connected to illegal drug use, as much as 94 per cent of people caught for violent crimes are under the influence of these unlawful narcotics,” he said.</p>
      <p>The SAPS statistics for Nelspruit police station reflected 440 reported drug-related crimes, which is down by an astounding 19.6 per cent from last year’s statistics.</p>

      <p>Zandile Gqawa, the Nelspruit police spokesman gave the following tips for reporting drug-related incidents:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take down a brief description of the person you want to report. You may take a photograph but don’t put yourself in harm’s way.</li>
        <li>Indicate the place and time of when and where the incident occurred when you phone your nearest police.</li>
        <li>You can give an anonymous tip to the police, without having to complete an affidavit with your details</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phone the Crime Stop line on <i>08600-10111</i> or contact Nelspruit SAPS on <i>013 -759- 1008</i></p>
