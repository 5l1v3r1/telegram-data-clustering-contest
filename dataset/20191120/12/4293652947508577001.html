      <h1>Women’s hockey Dream Gap Tour coming to Toronto in January</h1>

      <p>TORONTO — The Professional Women’s Hockey Players’ Association’s latest barn-storming stop will be back in Toronto and feature six teams.</p>
      <p>The PWHPA on Wednesday announced its fourth Dream Gap Tour stop will be held January 11-12 in northern Toronto. There will be 120 players participating, representing the largest turnout of the association’s four stops to date.</p>
      <p>The series was launched in Toronto in September, followed by weekend events in New Hampshire and Chicago last month.</p>
      <p>The PWHPA is made up of about 200 of the world’s top players and was established in May after the Canadian Women’s Hockey League folded. The players have pledged not to play professionally in North America this season in a bid to gain support to establish a single league with a sustainable economic model.</p>
