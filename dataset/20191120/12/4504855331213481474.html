      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:15:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) — Where will you be expanding your horizons in 2020?</p>
      <p>If you take National Geographic’s advice, you’ll be seal-watching in Quebec, hiking in Hungary or braving the world’s tallest bridge in Guizhou, China.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel">trave</a>l publisher has just released its <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/features/best-trips-2020/">Best Trips</a> list, highlighting 25 destinations it recommends for “transformative travels” in 2020.</p>
      <p>“Best Trips is our annual list of where to go, what to know and how to see the world in the year ahead,” says George Stone, executive editor of travel at National Geographic.</p>
      <p>“To build the list we worked with National Geographic editors around the world as well as photographers, writers, explorers and, of course, passionate travelers to report on the essential sites to see and places to be in 2020.”</p>
      <p>The picks are divided into four categories: Culture, City, Nature and Adventure.</p>
      <h3>Culture picks for 2020</h3>
