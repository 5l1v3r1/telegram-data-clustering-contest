      <p>KTVO spoke with Patti Preston, executive director of Kirksville Housing Authority, and Bridget Morton, executive director of NEMO Senior Services, Inc., about what the accomplishment of having this renovated dining room means to them.</p>
      <blockquote>“My goal was to make it a pleasant atmosphere so that folks in the community would feel comfortable coming in and enjoying a great meal from an organization that provides a great service to our community,” Preston said.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“We were so pleased that Patti and the housing authority and her board were able to complete this remodel for us. To watch our tenant or our customers and clients come in and look at all the different new things on the walls they smile. We wanted this to be a place called home,” Morton said.</blockquote>
