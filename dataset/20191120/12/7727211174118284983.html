      <h1>Poundland is no longer offering 'everything for £1'</h1>
      <h2>The discount retailer will now offer products above and below £1 for the very first time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:30:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/elle-may-rice/" target="_blank">Elle May Rice</a></address>
      <p>Poundland has scrapped its £1 price pledge as of today.</p>
      <p>The budget retailer will now offer products above and below £1 for the very first time, within the range of 50p to £5.</p>
      <p>The move follows a trial run in 24 West Midlands stores, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/breaking-poundland-scraps-1-price-20919984">Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>It is said the roll out of new prices will enable <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/13-products-you-didnt-know-17100947">Poundland</a> to deliver a “broader range of items at simple prices in three key categories - household goods, health and beauty and grocery”.</p>
      <p>Barry Williams, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/13-products-you-didnt-know-17100947">Poundland's</a> managing director said: "We've introduced simple pricing in time for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> so we can offer customers even more choice and even better value for money.</p>
      <p>"Our shoppers love the amazing value we provide and now we can begin bringing that value on wider ranges that they now can find in stores for the first time.</p>
      <p>"Our team of talented buyers has moved heaven and earth to bring these ranges to store in time for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> and I’d like to thank them for all their hard work."</p>
      <h3>Poundland’s 50p to £5 products</h3>
      <p>Here are some examples of what shoppers can find in stores:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Matchmakers - 75p</li>
        <li>Walkers (24 packs) - £3</li>
        <li>L’Oreal Elvive Fibrology shampoo - £2</li>
        <li>Comfort Blue Skies fabric conditioner - £4</li>
        <li>Nivea Men Fresh Power 0% deodorant - £1.50</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/13-products-you-didnt-know-17100947">Poundland</a> said that despite the new prices, three quarters of products will continue to sell at its core £1 price point.</p>
