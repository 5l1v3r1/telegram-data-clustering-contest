      <p>MAYO County Council is to replace a Christmas tree after an outcry over how it looked.</p>
      <p>When the tree was erected yesterday at Market Square in Castlebar ahead of the switching-on of the Christmas lights in the town on Friday, locals took to social media to give out about its condition.</p>
      <p>They shared the view that it looked bad and was simply not good enough.</p>
      <p>"It look like it's from last year," one business person said.</p>
      <p>Following representations made to him, local Councillor Ger Deere said he contacted Mayo County County about the concerns.</p>
      <p>"I am delighted to be able to report that it will be replaced tomorrow. Thanks to the council for swift action," he added.</p>
