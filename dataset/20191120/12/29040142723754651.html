      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton has told Reuters that he is willing to pay up to $2 billion to Sprint to buy back the prepaid wireless brand.</li>
        <li>Sprint is offloading Boost and Virgin Mobile prepaid brands to Dish Network for $1.4 billion.</li>
        <li>Adderton is doubtful of Dish remaining committed to serving Boost customers, as the satellite TV provider is focused on building its own 5G wireless network.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Peter Adderton, founder of Boost Mobile, has expressed interest in buying back the prepaid wireless brand from Sprint. Speaking to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile/boost-founder-says-willing-to-pay-up-to-2-billion-to-buy-brand-from-sprint-idUSKBN1XS2AG"><i>Reuters</i></a> on Monday, Adderton said that he would pay up to $2 billion for Boost Mobile, significantly higher than what satellite TV provider Dish Network is paying for Sprint's prepaid brands.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile and Sprint are expected to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dish-sprint-prepaid-faq">sell Boost and Virgin Mobile</a> brands to Dish Network for $1.4 billion. Along with the two prepaid wireless brands, Dish Network is also buying some wireless spectrum for $3.6 billion. However, Adderton still sees an opportunity to make the offer, as T-Mobile and Sprint are currently re-negotiating the terms of their merger agreement.</p>
      <p>Adderton believes that the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-sprint-merger-has-been-approved-fcc">merger</a> between T-Mobile and Sprint would end up harming lower-income consumers, as it would result in prices going up in the future. He also questioned Dish's commitment to Boost customers, as the company has said that it <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/dish-agrees-pay-5-billion-t-mobile-and-sprint-create-new-carrier">plans</a> to build its next generation 5G wireless network.</p>
      <p>Adderton had founded Boost Mobile in Australia in 2000 and brought the brand to the U.S. roughly a year later. In 2004, Boost Mobile sold its U.S. business to Nextel, which was then acquired by Sprint in 2005.</p>
