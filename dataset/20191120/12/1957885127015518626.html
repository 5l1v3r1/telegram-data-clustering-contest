      <h1>Nintendo Labo Kits on Switch drop to £30 ahead of Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>Update: Price now increased to £40...</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:26:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">Colm Ahern</a></address>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Sadly, ShopTo has now increased the price of the Variety Kit up to £40 instead. The next best price is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nintendo-221061-Labo-Variety-Kit/dp/B0792T5S6H?tag=eurgam-m-bf-21">£34.79 at Amazon</a>. Still better than the recommended price, but not as good a deal as it was a few hours ago. We'll keep an eye on these to see if they're reduced again any time soon.</p>
      <p><b>Original story:</b> If you missed the cardboard craze last year, now's a pretty good time to jump in with Nintendo Labo, as both the Variety Kit and the Robot Kit have been heavily discounted over on ShopTo in the lead-up to Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Either would undoubtedly have your child beaming on Christmas morning; plus they would leave less of a dent in your current account at their current price. The Nintendo Labo Variety Kit and the Nintendo Labo Robot Kit are available at £29.85 each, which is a saving of approximately £70 if you pick up both.</p>

      <p>If you're not aware, the Variety Kit allows you to cobble together a number of cardboard playthings such as a motorbike and a piano, while the Robot Kit has you building and playing with, well, robots. When we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-04-nintendo-labo-review-an-ingenious-and-generous-cardboard-triumph">reviewed Nintendo Labo</a> back in April of last year, we called it "a mash of Lego and origami that is wholesome and unique," and why wouldn't you want that in your house, quite frankly?</p>
