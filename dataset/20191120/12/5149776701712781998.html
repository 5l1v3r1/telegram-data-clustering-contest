      <h1>Former Nottingham Forest striker blasts Jose Mourinho as Spurs appoint him as manager</h1>
      <h2>'Amazing how some have bought into "Mourinho the winner" without any regard for how he leaves clubs'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:28:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> striker Stan Collymore has questioned Tottenham's appointment of Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is the new manager of Tottenham following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss has signed a three-and-a-half year contract with the London club.</p>
      <p>The appointment comes less than 12 hours after Spurs parted company with Pochettino on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Portuguese said: "I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
