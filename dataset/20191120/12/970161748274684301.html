      <p>Fans of Timothee Chalamet will get a rare chance to see him on stage in London next year as he will make his West End debut at the Old Vic.</p>
      <p>Timothee, 23, has signed on to star in 4000 Miles, an ‘odd couple-style’ drama alongside Dame Eileen Atkins, which will run through April and May next year.</p>
      <p>The Oscar-nominated actor is more used to life on the big screen rather than the stage, but artistic director Matthew Warchus knows the young star will be great in the role.</p>
      <p>He told the Evening Standard how the casting came about: ‘He was in London doing some publicity for one of his films and he came over to have a chat with me and we had a walk around the theatre and onto the stage, and I think he is excited by it.</p>

      <p>‘The question about can film actors come up with the goods on stage is usually answered when I talk to them.</p>
      <p>‘As a director, you can gauge an awful lot in that conversation about the understanding they have of what the job is and what it would take, if anything, to get them match fit for the stage.</p>

      <p>‘He is a phenomenally intelligent young man and he is fully aware of what is required.’</p>
      <p>He added that the play is: ‘someone nearing the end of their life and someone in the early stages thrown together in an odd couple-type situation.’</p>
      <p>The Pulitzer Prize nominated play focuses on a feisty former radical grandmother whose life changes when her grandson turns up at her apartment in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>Tickets for 4000 Miles will go on sale in December and it will be at the Old Vic theatre in London from 6 April until 23 May 2020.</p>
