      <p>BOUCHERVILLE, Que. — Lowe’s Companies Inc. says it will close 34 underperforming stores across six provinces as part of a restructuring of its Canadian business.</p>
      <p>The stores include 26 Ronas, six Lowe’s and two Reno-Depots spread across British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. </p>
      <p>The closures, set for early next year, add to its announced closure of 31 Canadian stores in November last year.</p>
      <p>The company says eligible employees will be offered jobs at nearby stores, given its need for workers throughout its network.</p>
      <p>North Carolina-based Lowe’s bought Rona in 2016 in a deal valued at $3.2 billion.</p>
      <p>The Canadian division of Lowe’s has more than 600 corporate and independent affiliate stores under the Lowe’s, Rona, Reno-Depot, Ace and Dick’s Lumber brands.</p>
