      <p>There has been a backlash against audience members in last night’s ITV debate who heckled Jeremy Corbyn when he talked about climate change.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader was asked if the environment was the biggest issue facing voters at the General Election next month.</p>
      <p>He replied: ‘It is the biggest issue facing the whole world.’</p>
      <p>There was relative silence, but then people started booing when he said that ‘the poorest people in the poorest countries lose out because of flooding and unusual weather patterns’.</p>

      <p>One man shouted: ‘Oh here we go!’ while others groaned and laughed.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn continued: ‘When we have unusual weather patterns in this country, when we have extreme levels of air pollution, we have to have a Green Industrial Revolution, when we invest for the future in sustainable industries and jobs and prevent the continuing damage to the natural world and our environment.’</p>

      <p>The response of the audience faced strong criticism on social media, with some incredulous that his comments drew such a reaction.</p>
      <p>Journalist James Murray tweeted: ‘It was obviously an incredibly bleak moment. A real time example of how little concern some people have for the fate of others.’</p>
      <p>Twitter user Francesca said: ‘Can’t believe when Jeremy Corbyn started talking about how the poorest people will be affected most by climate change the audience were heckling. WHERE IS THE LIE!?’</p>

      <p>Matthew Devine wrote: ‘Comments made from audience members in that debate were vile and disgusting.</p>
      <p>‘When Jeremy Corbyn referenced how climate change affects the poorest in society audience members replied with “here we go again.” Absolutely shameful and no excuse.’</p>
      <p>ITV have been contacted for comment.</p>
