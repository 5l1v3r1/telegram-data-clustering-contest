      <p><b>Kickoff:</b> 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, UB Stadium</p>
      <p><b>TV:</b> ESPN2</p>
      <p><b>Radio:</b> ESPN 1520</p>
      <p><b>Records:</b> Toledo 6-4, 3-3 Mid-American Conference; UB 5-5, 3-3</p>
      <p><b>Last time out:</b> The Bulls lost, 30-27, on Thursday (Nov. 14) at Kent State. UB gave up 24 points in the fourth quarter to the Golden Flashes, including the winning field goal by Matthew Trickett with one second left in regulation.</p>
      <p>The Rockets lost, 31-28, to Northern Illinois on Nov. 13 at the Glass Bowl in Toledo. The Rockets trailed by 21 points and scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter against the Huskies, but John Richardson’s 25-yard field goal for Northern Illinois broke a 28-28 tie with 41 seconds left.</p>
      <p><b>History:</b> Toledo leads the all-time series, 7-4.</p>
      <p><b>Bulls seek bowl eligibility:</b> UB can earn its sixth win, which would make the Bulls bowl-eligible for a third consecutive season, and for the fifth time in program history. Six wins, however, might not guarantee the Bulls a bowl bid. UB finished 6-6 two years ago and did not receive an invite to bowl game, despite winning its last three regular-season games.</p>
      <p><b>On the run:</b> The Toledo-UB matchup will showcase the rushing offenses of both teams. The Bulls will face the top rushing offense in the conference in Toledo, which averages 245.7 yards per game; UB is second in the conference, averaging 226.5 yards per game.</p>
      <p>UB sophomore Jaret Patterson broke the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the second season as he ran for 141 yards last week against Kent State. The sophomore has 1,159 yards and needs 31 yards to pass O.D. Underwood (1,189 yards) for fifth on the program's all-time single-season list. Branden Oliver set the single-season rushing record of 1,535 yards in 2013.</p>
      <p><b>Clamp down on defense:</b> Entering Tuesday’s games, the Bulls lead the MAC in rush defense and are fifth in the nation in the statistical category (88.4 yards per game).</p>
      <p>UB has 23 sacks in its last five games. It leads the MAC and is one of four teams tied for eighth in the nation (UB, Clemson, Virginia, UAB) with 34 sacks. Defensive end Taylor Riggins leads the MAC with 7.5 sacks, while defensive end Malcolm Koonce is tied for second with Central Michigan defensive lineman Sean Adesanya, each with seven sacks.</p>
      <p>The defense has been a hallmark for the Bulls for most of the season, but the Bulls gave up 177 of Kent State’s 284 yards in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p><b>For the foes:</b> The Rockets are one of four bowl-eligible teams in the MAC (along with Miami Ohio, Central Michigan and Western Michigan), and they still have an outside shot to win the MAC West Division title.</p>
      <p>The Rockets, however, are 1-3 in road games and 0-2 in MAC road games, and they have been injury-prone at key positions this season. Eli Peters is the third player to start at quarterback this season, after Mitchell Guadagni (six starts) and Carter Bradley (one start). Guadagni and Bradley are out with undisclosed injuries; Guadagni hasn’t played since Oct. 12, a 20-7 loss to Bowling Green, and Bradley made his only start Oct. 19 in a 52-14 loss at Ball State.</p>
      <p>Peters is 52-for-88 passing for 665 yards and six touchdowns and has been intercepted twice. He threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns on 26-of-38 passing against Northern Illinois.</p>
      <p>Bryant Koback had only two carries last week when he sustained an ankle injury against Northern Illinois. He rushed for 67 yards a week prior in a win against Kent State; Koback sustained a leg injury Nov. 5 against the Golden Flashes. Koback is third in the MAC with 1,066 rushing yards, but Shakif Seymour will be Toledo’s primary running back if Koback isn’t available against UB.</p>
      <p>Entering the week, the Rockets are first in the MAC and 14th in the nation in rushing offense (245.7 yards per game) and second in the MAC in total offense (445.1 yards per game).</p>
