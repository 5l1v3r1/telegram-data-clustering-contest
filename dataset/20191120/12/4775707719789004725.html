      <h3>Red Dead Online's Newest Legendary Bounty is Here, No News of Next Outlaw Pass</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 20 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Rockstar's latest <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61231/Wanted-Infamous-Grizzly-Bear-Baiter-Yukon-Nikoli-Borodin?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=rdo-yukonnik-11192019&amp;utm_content=newswire">newswire article</a> covers "Yukon" Nikoli Borodin, the bear-trapping Legendary bounty for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Red-Dead-Redemption-2/achievements">Red Dead Redemption 2 online.</a></p>

      <p>Borodin is a Russian trapper and hunter. He's already wanted for crimes in Alaska, and is now lurking in the area around Strawberry, where he's wanted for several murders. He's also connected to the disappearance of a U.S. marshal who was sent out to bring him in, but never returned. It doesn't seem like Borodin runs his own gang, like the last few bounties did, but he does have a group with him and, what's more, he's got captive grizzly bears. The clip above shows Borodin and his dogs going up against a grizzly, and Bounty Hunters going after Borodin's bounty will be facing them as well. Rockstar say that players will get a "handsome monetary reward" for bringing Borodin in, along with 3 Special Snake Oil and 10 Big Game Meat. But before you get too excited, players have replied to Rockstar's tweet to say that the handsome reward they got was around $10.</p>
      <p>The new pieces of clothing coming to Wheeler, Rawson &amp; Co this week are the Chumley Flat Cap, Salcedo Shirt, Crutchfield Suspenders, a pair of Dress Shoes, the Cardenas Poncho, the Ballard Jacket, Aguirre Boots, Goodale Shirtwaist, and Fulbright Coat.

      <p>However, players have been quick to notice that there hasn't as yet been any word about the next Outlaw Pass. The Outlaw Pass for Red Dead Online is basically a Battle Pass. It gave players 70 levels to rank up through, with about 1000 XP for each level. It rewarded unique clothing, weapon styles, bonus Gold Bars and horse accessories like the Death Ram Horse Mask. Reaching level 70 resulted in about 80 rewards overall, and people were hurrying to complete it before it expired on the 18th November. Now, players are waiting on word about the next Outlaw Pass. It seems they were expecting to hear something today, if at least a comment to say that it was on the way. It seems likely that we could get news about it next week. The general hope seems to be that now Rockstar have had some time to settle Red Dead 2 in on PC, they can turn their attention back to future updates.</p>
      <p>We'll let you know as and when we hear about the next Outlaw Pass, and about all Red Dead 2 news.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres â€” when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
