      <h2>The online retail giant has launched an eye-catching early Black Friday deal on the Alexa device</h2>

      <p>Amazon hit the headlines with a deal for a 99p Echo Dot device earlier this month but its latest deal may be even better.</p>
      <p>The online retail giant has launched an early Black Friday countdown and one of the biggest deals of the day is a £95 saving on one of its own devices.</p>
      <p>The Echo Plus, a premium version of the Echo Dot with a better speaker and the ability to connect and control everything from smart light bulbs to music streaming services, has been slashed in price by £95 and is now priced at just <a href="https://amzn.to/340XMGq">£44.99.</a></p>
      <p>The new first generation Echo Plus with built-in smart home hub is usually listed at £139.99 but the flash sale has drastically reduced the price of the item in time for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Capable of playing Spotify, Amazon Music and other streaming services like an Echo Dot, the Echo Plus also comes with a ZigBee smart home hub which allows you to set up compatible ZigBee lights, plugs and more from brands including Philips Hue, Hive and more.</p>
      <p>It also has an upgraded speaker system with a 2.5” downward-firing woofer and 0.8” tweeter powered by Dolby.</p>
      <p>Amazon has also cut the price of <a href="https://amzn.to/35naEqS">Amazon Music</a> , a streaming service with over 50 million songs, to just 99p for four months, meaning the whole bundle costs £45.99 and gives you the Echo Plus and four months of Amazon Music.</p>
      <p>Amazon's full Black Friday sale begins on 22 November and runs for eight days until Black Friday itself on 29 November. It will then launch a series of Cyber Monday offers on 2 December.</p>
