      <p><b>CHICAGO (CNN/AP) – </b>Actor Jussie Smollett is suing the City of Chicago and the city's police department, claiming malicious prosecution.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for the former “Empire” star filed a countersuit on Tuesday after the city sued Smollett to recover $130,000 spent investigating his claim that he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack.</p>
      <p>In January, Smollett said two men attacked him.</p>
      <p>Chicago police investigated the case for weeks.</p>
      <p>They later said they believed Smollett staged the attack to boost his acting career. He was charged with 16 felony counts.</p>
      <p>But a prosecutor dropped the charges in March after Smollett forfeited $10,000 in bail money and completed community service.</p>
      <p>Smollett’s lawyers say that should have been of end it.</p>
      <p>The city hasn’t commented on the lawsuit.</p>
