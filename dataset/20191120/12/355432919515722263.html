        <i>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> is scheduled to testify Wednesday morning in a highly anticipated appearance before the House Intelligence Committee as part of the impeachment inquiry into <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s dealings with Ukraine. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Sondland originally testified behind closed doors that he did not know precisely why U.S. military aid to Ukraine was held up and said that, in a September phone call, Trump denied using nearly $400 million in U.S. financial aid as leverage to get Kyiv to open two politically motivated investigations. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>But the Trump donor and political appointee revised his testimony earlier this month to say that he "presumed" that the delayed military aid was conditioned upon Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announcing investigations into 2016 election interference and Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company that employed the son of former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>, a leading 2020 presidential candidate.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Sondland is viewed as a wild card witness. Neither Democrats nor Republicans know whether he will help or hurt Trump during his day in the hot seat.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i><a href="https://thehill.com/person/laura-cooper">Laura Cooper</a>, a deputy assistant secretary of Defense, and <a href="https://thehill.com/person/david-hale">David Hale</a>, an undersecretary of State, are scheduled to testify on Wednesday afternoon before the Intelligence panel, which is led by Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) and ranking member <a href="https://thehill.com/people/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a> (R-Calif.).</i>

        <b>Republicans force votes for testimony from whistleblower, Hunter Biden</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>8:25 p.m.</i><br/><br/>At the end of the marathon day of testimony, Republicans on the Intelligence Committee sought to issue five subpoenas which, among other things, would have compelled the testimony from several witnesses they'd previously requested, including the whistleblower and Hunter Biden.<br/><br/>Behind Schiff, the Democrats on the panel have refused those requests, citing safety concerns surrounding the anonymous whistleblower and an unwillingness, in Schiff's description, to pursue "an improper" probe into the Bidens.<br/><br/>"We will not allow, as I said before, this committee to be used either to out the whistleblower or for purposes of engaging in the same improper investigation that the president sought to force Ukraine to commit," Schiff said.<br/><br/>Republicans also submitted motions for the whistleblower to release certain documents related to his complaint; for a financial firm to release documents pertaining to Hunter Biden's time on the board of Burisma; and for the Democratic National Committee to release communications with Ukrainian officials.<br/><br/>All five motions were shot down by the majority Democrats on the committee.</p>

        <b>Schiff closes with speech highlighting claims of Trump's corruption</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>7:55 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Schiff in his closing statement sought to undermine the argument that Trump was interested in pursuing anti-corruption measures in Ukraine by highlighting examples he alleged proved the president's own corruption.</p>
      <p>His final remarks after roughly 11 hours of testimony did not focus much on the statements of Cooper and Hale, but instead noted some of the most damaging claims made by Sondland earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>Schiff said Trump's push for Ukraine to look into the Bidens was not evidence of anti-corruption, but of corruption, and that the same was true of the quid pro quo arrangement Sondland detailed involving a White House meeting for Zelensky.</p>
      <p>He credited the men and women of the departments of Defense and State with carrying out an anti-corruption agenda, but warned that Trump was undercutting it with his own actions.</p>
      <p>"When they see a president of the United States who is not devoted to the rule of law, who is not devoted to anti-corruption, but instead demonstrates in word and deed corruption, they are forced to ask themselves what does America stand for anymore?" Schiff concluded.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nunes says impeachment proceedings amount to an ‘inquisition’ in closing remarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>7:49 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Nunes compared the impeachment inquiry into President Trump to the inquisition in the Middle Ages during his closing remarks Wednesday night, saying that Trump has fewer rights than victims of the inquisition. </p>
      <p>“This is not impeachment inquiry, this is an impeachment inquisition,” Nunes said. “Incredibly, or maybe not so much given the Democrats’ track record, an inquisition victim had more rights than the Democrats are giving the president. After all, inquisition victims had the right to know their accuser’s name.”</p>
      <p>In invoking the accuser, Nunes was referring to the anonymous whistleblower who brought up concerns about Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky. </p>
      <p>Nunes ended his closing remarks by yielding to “Mr. Schiff for story-time hour.”</p>
      <p>Schiff responded that he “thanked the gentleman as always for his remarks,” leading to audience laughter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hale endorses leadership of Yovanovitch in Ukraine</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>7:32 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Hale endorsed the description by Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/denny-heck">Denny Heck</a> (D-Wash.) of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a> as “a dedicated and courageous patriot,” with Heck encouraging Hale to do so in order to “demonstrate leadership.”</p>
      <p>Hale said that he was aware that “we had an exceptional officer doing exceptional work at a very critical embassy in Kyiv,” and said that he believed State Department officers are “the best group of diplomats anywhere in the world.”</p>
      <p>Heck pressed Hale to show support for Yovanovitch in the wake of Secretary of State <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mike-pompeo">Mike Pompeo</a>’s refusal to condemn what Heck described as Trump’s attempt to “attack” Yovanovitch during her testimony last week. </p>
      <p>Trump criticized Yovanovitch on Twitter while she testified, with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/470636-yovanovitch-responds-to-trump-tweets-at-hearing-says-hes-trying-to">Yovanovitch saying</a> that she felt the “effect” of that tweet was to “intimidate." </p>
      <p>“I think Secretary Pompeo’s silence is nothing less than a betrayal of the men and the women whom he swore an oath to lead,” Heck said on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Heck then encouraged Hale to show support for Yovanovitch, saying that “I am giving you an opportunity to send a clear and resounding message to the men and women who serve in dangerous foreign posts throughout the globe that what happened to Marie Yovanovitch was wrong.”</p>
      <p>Hale said simply in response that he “endorsed entirely” Heck’s description of Yovanovitch as a “patriot.”</p>

        <b>Ratcliffe pushes Cooper on what Ukraine knew about aid</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>7:30 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Under questioning from Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-ratcliffe">John Ratcliffe</a> (R-Texas), Cooper said the emails her staff received on July 25 stating the Ukrainian Embassy was inquiring about the security assistance did not “necessarily” mean they were aware of a hold on the aid at the time.</p>
      <p>Ratcliffe was seeking to push back on press reports describing Cooper as testifying that Ukrainians asked about the "hold" on aid. </p>
      <p>Cooper reiterated that the emails her staff received from the State Department said that the Ukrainian Embassy and lawmakers in Congress “are asking about security assistance” know about the “FMF situation.”</p>
      <p>“They don’t necessarily mean hold, correct?” Ratcliffe asked of the terms.</p>
      <p>“Not necessarily,” Cooper said.</p>
      <p>She said that her staff believed Ukrainians knew about the hold on aid before it became public the following month but that she had no specific evidence. </p>
      <p>“It’s the recollection of my staff that they likely knew but, no, I do not have a certain data point to offer you,” Cooper said. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cooper says Moscow would benefit most from hold on aid</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>6:50 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Cooper was asked which country would benefit most if U.S. military aid to Ukraine was withheld. She didn't miss a beat.<br/><br/>"Russia," she said.<br/><br/>The response was prompted from questioning from Rep. André Carson (D-Ind.), who extracted from Cooper a portrait of Ukraine as a vulnerable ally on the front lines of the fight to repel the march of Russian aggression into Europe.<br/><br/>Cooper said Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014 would have been more severe without the help of U.S. aid. If that funding and equipment were withheld, she said, it would threaten U.S. national security and "validate Russia's violation of international law."<br/><br/>The reason behind the White House decision to withhold almost $400 million in aid to Kyiv remains a lingering mystery in the Ukraine saga at the center of the House impeachment inquiry.<br/><br/>The aid was ultimately released on Sept. 11, and Cooper emphasized that the delay did not affect the delivery of military equipment over that duration.  <br/><br/>"There was no shortfall in equipment deliveries [over that timeline]," she said.<br/><br/>Yet Democrats contend Trump finally released the aid only after a backlash from Congress and rising alarm in the national security community. In their eyes, the hold is just more evidence that Trump has nefarious ties with Moscow.<br/><br/>"All roads lead to Putin," Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-Calif.) said last week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trump: "If this were a prizefight, they'd stop it!"</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>6:43 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Trump weighed in on the second round of hearings of the day as he traveled back to Washington from Texas aboard Air Force One.</p>
      <p>"If this were a prizefight, they’d stop it!" Trump tweeted, clearly pleased with the way the hearings were playing out. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Wednesday's hearings have been difficult for the White House's defense of the president, however.</p>
      <p>Sondland testified that there was a quid pro quo tying a White House meeting to a public announcement of investigations that Trump wanted, and Cooper disclosed that Ukraine was aware of an issue with security aid earlier than previously known.</p>

        <b>Jordan pushes back at Schiff assertion that minority witnesses were called</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>6:33 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jim-jordan">Jim Jordan</a> (R-Ohio) pushed back against an assertion made by Schiff earlier in the hearing that Democrats had called Republican-requested witnesses to testify.</p>
      <p>Jordan told Schiff that “they are all your witnesses,” citing the Republicans being unable to subpoena anyone to testify.</p>
      <p>“You gave us an opportunity to get a list to you a couple weeks ago, where we made suggestions of who you might allow us to have, so we did put three people of those 17 on that list so that they could provide at least some semblance of context and framework for this entire thing,” Jordan said.</p>
      <p>Jordan added that “once again, misleading the folks watching this hearing is not helpful.”</p>
      <p>Jordan made these comments in response to Schiff saying earlier in the hearing that Hale and previous witnesses <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kurt-volker">Kurt Volker</a> and Tim Morrison were witnesses requested by the Republicans.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Schiff says minority was informed ahead of time about hearing procedure change</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>6:20 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Schiff pushed back on GOP complaints about a change in process for the second impeachment hearing of the day, saying House Intelligence Committee Republicans were notified Tuesday that the rules governing questioning would be different.</p>
      <p>Schiff noted that for the hearing involving Cooper and Hale “we will forgo the first round of questions from committee counsel and immediately proceed to member questions under the five minute rule.”</p>
      <p>Schiff said that Democrats had told the Republicans of this change ahead of time, and were told by Republicans “OK, got it, thanks for the heads up.”</p>
      <p>Schiff also responded to accusations by Nunes that Democrats were blocking Republican requests for specific witnesses to testify, pointing to Hale and two previous witnesses — Volker and Morrison — as all being Republican-requested witnesses.</p>
      <p>“I can understand why the minority does not want to now characterize them as minority-requested witnesses, but nonetheless they were minority-requested witnesses," he said.</p>

        <b>Giuliani says he didn't bring up military aid with Ukraine</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>6:15 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/rudy-giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, the president's personal attorney, said following Sondland's testimony that he did not bring up military aid with the Ukrainians.</p>
      <p>Giuliani told Glenn Beck on his BlazeTV show that the issue of withheld funding came up after he had completed his "assignment."</p>
      <p>"The reality is, that whole issue of military aid didn’t come up until after I had finished the assignment they gave me," Giuliani said. "I never discussed military aid with them. And of course I can’t tell you what I discussed with the president."</p>
      <p>"But I had no involvement at all in the issue of military aid, and I believe that is a complete non-issue," he added.</p>
      <p>He later added that part of his "mandate" was to gather evidence that would assist Trump in former special counsel <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a>'s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>Sondland testified that he understood from Giuliani that Ukraine had to publicly announce an investigation into the 2016 election and Burisma in order to secure a White House meeting with Trump. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Cooper says Ukraine asked about security assistance in July</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>6:10 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Cooper testified that her staff heard that Ukraine was aware of a hold on security assistance in July, an update from her closed-door deposition. </p>
      <p>She cited emails from her staff on July 25 in which the State Department said the Ukrainian Embassy and House Foreign Affairs Committee were “asking about security assistance.”</p>
      <p>She recalled another email from July 3 from the State Department stating that they had heard the congressional notification for security assistance was “being blocked” by the Office of Management and Budget at the White House.</p>
      <p>Cooper's disclosure of new correspondence could prove a blow to a main GOP line of defense, which is that the hold on Ukraine aid was ultimately lifted and that the Ukrainians were unaware of the freeze in funding early enough for there to have been a quid pro quo.</p>
      <p>Cooper said her staff made her aware of the correspondence after she had already given her closed-door testimony, but that none of the emails were brought to her attention at the time.</p>
      <p>The hold on Ukrainian security assistance has been a key point in the impeachment inquiry. Each witness has said they opposed putting a hold on the aid, but none have definitively said they knew who ordered it to be frozen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Witnesses sworn in</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>5:54 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Cooper and Hale were sworn in following opening statements delivered by Schiff and Nunes.<br/><br/>Schiff emphasized the importance of the military aid to Ukraine that was frozen temporarily by the White House over the summer. That funding, he argued, is vital to both the national security interests of the United States and to Ukraine's efforts to repel Russian aggression in eastern parts of the country.<br/><br/>Nunes hammered the process as "skewed," since Republicans were not permitted to hear from certain requested witnesses, including the whistleblower and Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>"The accusations change by the hour," he said, urging Schiff to shut the process down. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Nunes says Americans are getting ‘skewed impression’ of impeachment inquiry from Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>5:50 p.m.</i> Nunes, in his opening statement, said Democrats are giving the American people a “skewed version” of the impeachment inquiry by blocking witnesses and said they were holding hearings “in search of a crime.”</p>
      <p>He criticized Schiff for not allowing the anonymous whistleblower who first filed a complaint about Trump’s July phone call with Zelensky to testify, as well as not allowing testimony from Hunter Biden. </p>
      <p>“As we Republicans have argued at these hearings, the American people are getting a skewed impression of these events,” Nunes said. “That’s because the Democrats assume full authority to call witnesses, and they promptly rejected any new witnesses the Republicans requested.”</p>
      <p>Nunes also questioned why Democrats were pursuing the impeachment inquiry against Trump, urging Schiff to “bring it to a close.”</p>
      <p>“What exactly are the Democrats impeaching the president for? None of us here really know, because the accusations change by the hour,” Nunes said. “Once again, this is impeachment in search of a crime. Mr. Chairman I would urge you to bring this to a close, adjourn this hearing, and move on and get back to the work of the Intelligence Committee.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>White House says Sondland testimony 'completely exonerates' Trump</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>4:38 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The White House declared in a statement that Sondland's testimony "completely exonerates" Trump of wrongdoing, arguing that the ambassador's allegations were based on "his presumptions and beliefs."</p>
      <p>"Over the course of the Democrats’ desperate impeachment inquiry, we have heard a great deal of hearsay, conjecture, and outright speculation about whether the President withheld military aid to the Ukraine based on a quid pro quo," press secretary <a href="https://thehill.com/people/stephanie-grisham">Stephanie Grisham</a> said in a statement. "The Democrats certainly tried — and have again failed — to make their case by using unreliable and indirect evidence. This country deserves better."</p>
      <p>Sondland testified that there was a quid pro quo tying a White House meeting for the Ukrainian president to a public announcement of investigations that Trump wanted based on conversations with his personal attorney.</p>
      <p>But Sondland said he did not hear directly from Trump that aid for Ukraine was contingent on any investigations.</p>
      <p>"The direct evidence heard at these hearings makes clear that the Democrats’ allegations are baseless and a pathetic attempt overthrow the 2016 election," Grisham said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Team Trump: Hearing ‘fizzled’ for Democrats</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>4:15 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement that the hearing "fizzled" for Democrats, echoing the president and his GOP allies by seizing on Sondland's testimony that Trump told him that he wanted "nothing" from Ukraine. </p>
      <p>“Over and over we’ve heard from Democrats and the media that the next hearing, the next witness, the next testimony would be the bombshell they’ve been promising, only to have it fizzle out like all the rest. It has happened yet again," McEnany said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Ambassador Sondland said repeatedly that President Trump directly told him he wanted nothing from Ukraine. Sondland also testified that no one — no one — ever told him that Ukraine aid was tied to investigations. In a normal world this would be the end of the story, but in Washington, D.C., the Democrats’ sham impeachment rolls on — to the detriment of the American people.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Schiff calls Sondland testimony ‘seminal moment’</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>3:41 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Schiff in his closing remarks recapped some key allegations levied by Sondland in his opening statement, describing the ambassador's marathon appearance as a turning point in the impeachment proceedings.</p>
      <p>“This is a seminal moment in our investigation, and the evidence you’ve brought forward is deeply significant and troubling,” Schiff said.</p>
      <p>He recounted some of the most damning points of Sondland’s opening remarks, including when the ambassador said he and others were following the president’s orders. He also highlighted Sondland’s testimony that there was a quid pro quo tying a White House meeting for Ukraine to a public announcement of investigations.</p>
      <p>While Sondland’s testimony implicated multiple high-level administration officials and the president’s personal attorney, Schiff said Trump is the one who should be viewed as the mastermind. </p>
      <p>“The question is: What are we prepared to do about it? Is there any accountability, or are we forced to conclude that this is just now the world that we live in?” Schiff said. </p>
      <p>“We are not prepared to say that,” he added.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nunes says Sondland testimony yielded no evidence to support impeachment</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>3:38 p.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Nunes said during his closing remarks that Sondland’s testimony yielded no evidence to support impeachment, describing the case brought against Trump by the Democrats as a “conspiracy theory.”</p>
      <p>“Nothing that we have heard establishes a claim that the president acted improperly in his dealings with Ukraine, and certainly nothing has been presented to support anything near impeachment,” Nunes said.</p>
      <p>He added that “testimony received today was far from compelling, conclusive, and provides zero evidence of any of the crimes that have been alleged.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Sondland struck a joking tone during a handful of his exchanges with lawmakers as his hearing dragged on into its sixth hour.</p>
      <p>“That’s what my wife calls me,” Sondland quipped when asked by Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/subramanian-raja-krishnamoorthi">Raja Krishnamoorthi</a> (D-Ill.) about National Security Council official Tim Morrison referring to him as “the Gordon problem” the day before.</p>
      <p>Sondland, who donated $1 million to the president’s inauguration, was also asked about Trump’s efforts to distance himself from the EU ambassador by saying he doesn’t know Sondland well, commenting: “Easy come, easy go.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Sondland also sought to lighten up an exchange about his memory regarding his calls with Trump. He was asked by Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/valdez-val-demings">Val Demings</a> (D-Fla.) why he remembered specific details of a September call with Trump while not remembering details of other interactions.</p>
      <p>“I remember the first girl I kissed,” Sondland said, laughing. “I remembered that conversation because, as I said, it was a pretty intense, short conversation.”</p>

      </p>
      <p><i>3:18 p.m</i>.</p>
      <p>After aggressive questioning from Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), Sondland conceded that Trump would be the person to benefit most from a Ukrainian investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, with Maloney criticizing Sondland for being reticent to say it out loud.</p>
      <p>After Maloney repeated his question multiple times, Sondland said that he “assumed President Trump would benefit” from a Ukrainian investigation of one of his 2020 rivals.</p>
      <p>“There we have it. See, it didn’t hurt a bit, did it?” Maloney said, as audience members in the hearing room applauded.</p>
      <p>When Sondland objected to Maloney’s repeated questions, saying he “resented” what the lawmaker was trying to do, Maloney pushed back, calling out Sondland on the length of time it took to make that admission.</p>
      <p>“You have been forthright, this is your third try to do so, sir, didn’t work so well the first time, did it,” Maloney said in reference to Sondland’s closed door testimony in October and his subsequent reversal of his initial testimony this month.</p>
      <p>Maloney added that “with all due respect sir, we appreciate your candor, but let’s be really clear on what it took to get it out of you.”</p>

      <p>Nunes accused Schiff of “obstructing justice” by not giving Sondland the transcript of the deposition of an official involved in distributing foreign aid who spoke with the Intelligence Committee behind closed doors this past weekend.</p>
      <p>“I would think it’s obstruction of justice to not give the American people, and give the ambassador, the right to look at the transcript of the man who’s in charge of the foreign aid in this town,” Nunes said. “Now I could get into what he said, the chair could release what he said, but we’re not even allowed to call that witness today.”</p>
      <p>The witness Nunes referring to was Mark Sandy, a senior official within the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who gave a deposition to the committee on Saturday. Sandy reportedly told members of Congress that he did not know why the aid to Ukraine was held up.</p>

      <p>"I came into this at [former Ukraine special envoy Kurt] Volker’s request. Sondland is speculating based on VERY little contact. I never met him and had very few calls with him, mostly with Volker," Giuliani said on Twitter during the hearing.</p>
      <p>"Volker testified I answered their questions and described them as my opinions, NOT demands. I.E., no quid pro quo!" he added.</p>
      <p>Sondland repeatedly referenced Giuliani during his testimony. The ambassador told lawmakers that Trump directed him and other officials to "talk to Rudy" about certain Ukraine matters and that he understood Giuliani to be relaying the president's interests.</p>

      <p>“[Former Trump adviser] Tim Morrison testified that it took him all of doing a Google search to find out, ‘Oh, this is the significance of Burisma, it involves the Bidens,’” Schiff said. “Are you saying that all this time, up until the [July 25] call, you never made the connection between Burisma and the Bidens, you just thought the president and Rudy Giuliani were interested in this one particular Ukrainian company?”</p>
      <p>“Again, my role, Mr. Chairman, was just to get the meeting,” Sondland responded, referring to a sit-down between Trump and Zelensky.</p>
      <p>“I understand that, but my question is are you saying that for months and months, notwithstanding everything Rudy Giuliani was saying on TV and all the discussion with Rudy Giuliani, you never put Burisma together with the Bidens?” Schiff asked in response.</p>

      <p>“I don’t recall any abrupt ending of the meeting or people storming out or anything like that,” Sondland said, pushing back on Volker’s characterization of the meeting. “That would have been very memorable if someone stormed out of a meeting based on something I said.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he was aware at the time of anyone characterizing the arrangement as a “drug deal,” Sondland said he was not and that White House National Security Council official Fiona Hill had never described it as such to him, saying he was “shocked” to learn of the characterization, which was actually reportedly used by Bolton. </p>

      <p>Before he was sworn in, Schiff said that Congress would not tolerate any reprisal against witnesses and noted that any information that touched on classified information would be addressed separately. </p>

        <b>Nunes submits request to subpoena Hunter Biden, whistleblower in opening remarks</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>9:20 a.m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Nunes requested that Schiff subpoena both Biden’s son and the anonymous whistleblower who first kicked off the impeachment inquiry during his opening remarks on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“We need to subpoena Hunter Biden and the whistleblower for closed-door depositions, as well as relevant documents from the [Democratic National Committee], Hunter Biden’s firm Rosemont Seneca and the whistleblower,” Nunes said. “In the interest of some basic level of fairness, we expect you to concur with these subpoenas.”</p>
      <p>He then submitted the subpoenas for the record during the hearing.</p>
      <p>Schiff is unlikely to grant these subpoenas, having blocked testimony by the whistleblower last week, citing the evidence gathered from other sources than corroborates the whistleblower’s version of events. </p>
      <p>In a Wednesday letter to Schiff on the subpoenas, Nunes pushed back on this, writing that “following revelations that the whistleblower has a bias against President Donald Trump and the disclosure that you had received an early account of the whistleblower allegations, you reversed course to deny the whistleblower an opportunity to testify.”</p>
      <p>The subpoena request was also signed by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.</p>
      <p>During his opening remarks, Nunes also told Sondland that he was “here today to be smeared” and told him he was “sorry you have to go through this.”</p>
      <p>Nunes zeroed in on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, saying that it relates to the impeachment inquiry and shows the Democrats’ “mania to attack the president.”</p>
      <p>“They lied to the American people about that cooperation and refused to let us question the whistleblower to discover the truth,” Nunes said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Schiff accuses Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of a “concerted” effort to obstruct the House impeachment investigation and warned them it could be used as evidence to draft an article of impeachment.</p>
      <p>“They do so at their own peril,” Schiff said at the conclusion of his opening remarks, noting that the third article of impeachment against former President Nixon accused him of refusing to obey subpoenas from Congress.</p>
      <p>Schiff in particular seized on the opening statement of Sondland. Sondland in his opening statement will testify that an effort to use a White House meeting to press Ukraine for investigations was widely known within the administration and that he kept those at the State Department and within the White House updated of his efforts.</p>
      <p>“Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19, days before the Presidential call. As I communicated to the team, I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to ‘run a fully transparent investigation’ and ‘turn over every stone’ were necessary in his call with President Trump,” Sondland’s opening statement reads, quoting from an email he sent to Pompeo, acting White House chief of staff <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mick-mulvaney">Mick Mulvaney</a> and others on July 19.</p>
      <p>“We have not received a single document from the State Department as Ambassador Sondland’s opening statement will make here, those documents will bear directly on this investigation and this impeachment inquiry,” Schiff said during his opening statement Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“The knowledge of this scheme was far and wide and including, among others, Secretary of State Pompeo and the vice president,” Schiff continued.</p>

      <p>Pam Bondi, one of two new White House staffers brought on to handle impeachment messaging, said Wednesday morning that Trump does not know Sondland "very well."</p>
      <p>"We're going to see what Gordon Sondland has to say today," Bondi said on "CBS This Morning." "The president knows him. The president does not know him very well."</p>
      <p>Bondi, a former Florida attorney general, misstated Sondland's role, describing him as "ambassador to the Ukraine." Sondland is the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, though some in the Trump administration expressed concerns that he had expanded his portfolio to oversee matters related to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The comment from Bondi likely reflects a White House effort to distance the president from Sondland as he prepares to testify that there was a quid pro quo tying a White House meeting for the Ukrainian president to a pledge to conduct investigations Trump wanted.</p>
      <p>Bondi added that it's unlikely Trump will testify in the impeachment inquiry, despite the president's indication he was considering it earlier this week.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Sondland plans to testify Wednesday that there was a definite quid pro quo in Trump's demands to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was informed via email on July 19, days before the Presidential call. As I communicated to the team, I told President Zelensky in advance that assurances to 'run a fully transparent investigation' and 'turn over every stone' were necessary in his call with President Trump," Sondland will say, according to a copy of his opening remarks obtained by The Hill.</p>
      <p>Sondland will also heavily emphasize that at the “express direction of the president,” he, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and then-special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker had to work with Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, on Ukraine policy — something he said they did not want to do.</p>
      <p>Sondland described some of the circumstances of the phone call in which fellow call witness David Holmes, a career State Department official, described to House investigators. They were at a lunch in Kyiv when the president called Sondland to inquire about the subject of investigations, which Giuliani was pushing for at the time. </p>
      <p>“Other witnesses have recently shared their recollection of overhearing this call. For the most part, I have no reason to doubt their accounts,” Sondland testified. </p>

      <p>Sondland, who is set to testify later in the day in the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump's dealings with Kyiv, in mid-August shared a draft statement with Pompeo intended to convince the president to meet with Zelensky, two people briefed told the Times.</p>
      <p>The ambassador also reportedly talked with Pompeo about encouraging Zelensky to vow during a meeting between the leaders in Poland to take actions desired by Trump in order to improve U.S.-Ukraine relations. Pompeo reportedly approved this plan, but Trump canceled his trip to Poland, the Times noted.</p>
