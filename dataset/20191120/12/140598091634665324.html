      <h1>Sleek white spaces and roof terraces: The best boutique hotels in Malaga</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/i/isabella-noble/" target="_blank">Isabella Noble</a></address>
      <p>From Picasso to the Pompidou to the portside street-art-savvy Soho area, Málaga’s blossoming arts scene has firmly established itself as a highlight among Andalucía’s cultural riches. Meanwhile, terrific age-old tapas haunts and weathered seafood shacks mingle with glossy Michelin stars and avant-garde espresso specialists on the city’s always-lively food-and-drink scene. Fittingly, a flurry of originally designed boutique-inspired properties now offers a stylish, personal introduction to Andalucía’s sunniest city – whether your vibe is a minimal-chic, won’t-break-the-bank poshtel, a jazzed-up Art Deco jewel or an intimate bolthole overlooking Roman ruins. Here's our pick of the best boutique hotels in Málaga.</p>

      <p>8 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>Madrid-based design duo Sylvia and Victoria Melián Randolph are behind the fun, fresh, bold interiors, inspired by Málaga’s lush gardens and the Mediterranean. Nautical stripes and tropical florals take centre stage within the chicly restored late-19th-century building, and there’s a lively vibe as soon as you arrive into the palm-patterned lobby, where low lighting, leather lounge chairs and soft background music lend a touch of London or New York. Rooms spread upwards around a central patio washed by a gurgling fountain and are sunnily styled in royal blues, deep greens or bright turquoises evoking all that’s wonderful about Andalucía. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/malaga/hotels/room-mate-valeria-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 92 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/room-mate-valeria.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1malaga1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0malaga-Room2Mate2Valeria">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>8 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>Molina Lario occupies two graceful, revamped 19th-century buildings with ornate balconies, plus a modern extension, all three interconnected and framing a central interior patio. The design by Spanish designers Martínez Otero is a picture of fresh neutral-toned colours and plenty of natural light. The stylish, turquoise-cushioned rooftop bar is the place to be for sunset cocktails, while the sky-high pool terrace just above makes a fabulously scenic spot for lounging. DJ sessions, live music and other events are often hosted here, and there’s monthly flamenco in the courtyard of the ground-floor Mediterranean restaurant. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/malaga/hotels/hotel-molina-lario/">Read expert review</a> From £ 105 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/molina-lario.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1malaga1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0malaga-Hotel2Molina2Lario">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Malaga, Andalucia, Spain</p>
      <p>8 Telegraph expert rating</p>
      <p>The Teatro Romano’s crisp, creative, Scandi-inspired look is distinctly contemporary, and breathes fresh air into Málaga’s hotel scene, with a private, roomy feel and clever use of mirrors and natural light. The 13 rooms and eight kitchen-equipped apartments (in an adjoining building) are washed in cool whites and dove greys, and are invitingly warm, comfortable and elegant; most rooms overlook the Alcazaba and Roman theatre, some from little balconies. This is an incredibly convenient and atmospheric place to stay, with Málaga’s historic centre and most major sights right on your doorstep. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/malaga/hotels/hotel-boutique-teatro-romano/">Read expert review</a> From £ 65 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/boutique-teatro-romano.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1malaga1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0malaga-Hotel2Boutique2Teatro2Romano">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Dulces Dreams, spread over four floors of an old revamped townhouse, is one of Malaga’s original boutique hostels, packed full of imaginative character and loosely themed around cakes (‘dulce’ means ‘sweet’). Tasteful tiling, bamboo touches and splashes of bright pastels liven up the fresh all-white look. Rooms, though similarly styled, all have an individual feel and colour scheme, with arty touches such as colour-themed bedhead slogans, bamboo towel racks and floral-shaped lamps; all rooms overlook the church and street, most from little balconies. The hotel's lively downstairs café specialises in tasty homemade cakes, artisan coffee and health-focused bites. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/malaga/hotels/dulces-dreams-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 51 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/dulces-dreams.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1malaga1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0malaga-Dulces2Dreams">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Room Mate Larios, set in an elegant listed Art Deco building, is located on one of Málaga’s prime patches of real estate, right on the corner of the Plaza de la Constitución and shop-lined, pedestrianised Calle Larios in the heart of the city. With its distinctive Art Deco façade, jolly vibe, smart interiors and view-laden roof-terrace bar, this well-established heart-of-Málaga hotel ticks all the boxes for a stylish and personal city stay. Interiors marry check-print curtains and stripey carpets with original architecture, including the soaring ceilings, marble-floored bathrooms and checkered-floor lobby. Staff are notably lively, welcoming and professional, offering maps and all kinds of city tips. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/andalusia/malaga/hotels/room-mate-larios-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 81 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/larios.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1andalusia1malaga1articles1the0best0boutique0hotels0in0malaga-Room2Mate2Larios">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
