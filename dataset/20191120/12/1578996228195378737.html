      <h1>Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Are Reportedly Talking Again: She 'Always Had a Soft Spot'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:23:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Gigi Hadid's summer romance with Tyler Cameron is <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29620683/tyler-cameron-gigi-hadid-breakup-interview/">long over</a>...and apparently, she has been talking to her ex-boyfriend Zayn Malik, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1095090/gigi-hadid-is-back-in-touch-with-zayn-malik-after-her-split-from-tyler-cameron">E!</a> reports. A source explained this is a recent development; for a while, they weren't speaking to each other at all.</p>
      <p>Hadid "has always had a soft spot for Zayn and they have a lot of history together," the source explained. "They went through a phase where they took time apart and weren't communicating at all, but they have been in touch recently. She is supportive of him. They chat here and there but it's been casual."</p>
      <p>A source told E! that fans shouldn't get their hopes up about any romantic reconciliation at this point. "They are definitely not getting back together but are on good terms right now," the source said.</p>
      <p>Hadid and Malik had an on-off relationship. They broke up in March 2018 after two years of dating, then got back together in April. They were reported to be on a break-turned-breakup in November 2018. In January, outlets widely reported their second split. Hadid and Malik did not release any statements about it.</p>
      <p>But Malik still publicly declared his love for Hadid as recently as March 2019. A source <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26984095/why-gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-not-dating-again/">explained to </a><i><a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a26984095/why-gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-not-dating-again/">Us Weekly</a> </i>at the end of that month that she also still had feelings for him...but she wasn't about to act on them and start dating him again.</p>
      <p>"Gigi and Zayn still talk," Us's source said then. "She still has feelings for him, of course, but he has major issues and she knows they aren’t compatible. She’s still very single."</p>
