      <p>According to Siya sources, Cape Town City have put a big price tag on one of their players, while three others at the club are also being linked elsewhere.</p>
      <p>As reported in this week’s edition of Soccer Laduma, City have upped their asking price for Craig Martin, after it was reported in the past that the club was looking for around R5 million for his services at the time of interest shown from Mamelodi Sundowns and Orlando Pirates.</p>
      <p>Siya sources have since indicated that City now want R8 million for his services, with Pirates believed to be still monitoring the player.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Elsewhere at the club, as reported in the past weeks, Thamsanqa Mkhize, Thabo Nodada and Edmilson Dove have all made it onto the radar of Sundowns.</p>
      <p>However, according to a source close to the Citizens, the club will only be open to negotiating the futures of Nodada and Dove, if the offers are coming from abroad.</p>
      <p>While on the other hand, a source previously indicated that City could be open to local offers for Mkhize, although at this point it seems unlikely that the club will want to destabilize the team by letting their team captain go.</p>
      <p>The Citizens recently appointed Jan Olde Riekerink at the helm following Benni McCarthy’s departure and it remains to be seen what squad changes he will look to make in the January transfer window.  </p>
