      <p>A woman from Sidmouth has been ordered to pay compensation to a female police officer who she kicked in the groin during a drunken fracas.</p>
      <p>Christine Stafford was so drunk after a night out in Exeter that police arrested her and took her to hospital because she was unable to stand up.</p>
      <p>She kicked out at Police Sergeant Sarah Clark while she was at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, making contact in what a judge described as her 'nether regions' .</p>
      <p>Stafford, aged 59, of Salters Meadow, Sidmouth, admitted assault on an emergency worker and being drunk and disorderly when she appeared at Exeter Crown Court.</p>

      <p>He told her:"You have stayed out of trouble and have saved up the money to pay compensation, as you were asked to do. When you consider the incident in the round, I understand you got yourself injured in the incident.</p>
      <p>"It is right to observe that you were completely drunk at the time. It is an unpleasant situation for anyone to be kicked in what might be called the nether regions, which is always unwelcome."</p>
      <p>Mr Nigel Wraith, prosecuting, said the incident happened at 10.54 pm on July 10, 2019, outside the Horse and Groom pub in Fore Street, Heavitree.</p>
      <p>She was taken to hospital because she could not stand up. She became agitated, punched a wall, and kicked out at Sgt Clark, making contact in the area of the pubic bone.</p>
      <p>Miss Kelly Scrivener, defending, said Stafford has been doing well under a previous supervision order  and is addressing issues around alcohol and her mental health. She said she also suffered injury during the incident and her arrest.</p>
