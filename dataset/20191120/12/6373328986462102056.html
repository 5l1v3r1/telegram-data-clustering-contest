        <b>A make-up artist was left mortified after a fake tan fail left her resembling a ‘loaf of tiger bread’ for two weeks.</b>

      <p>Ellena Brice, 18, decided to give herself a makeover to restore her summer glow and cheer herself up as the winter months rolled in.</p>
      <p>However, she had never fake tanned before as she had always gone to a professional, so the teenager asked friends for recommendations and picked up the darkest shade available.</p>

      <p>When she returned home, Ellena followed the instructions and smothered herself in the tan, leaving it on for the recommended time before washing it off.</p>
      <p>The make-up artist said she ‘didn’t even think’ about how the colour would look on her, saying she was ‘so pale’ and wanted to make herself feel better.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Expecting a golden tan, Ellena was horrified to see the end result, stating:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>When I got home I put it all over the place but was shocked with what I saw when I washed the initial layer off. It looked disgusting – it was all in my pores, I had a brown hair upper lip – I was literally a walking Dorito!</blockquote>
      <p>Thinking she could get rid of the tan by washing it off, the teenager, from Orpington, Greater London, immediately tried to exfoliate the remaining tan off.</p>

      <p>However it wasn’t to be, as Ellena was left with the tan for an entire two weeks and even had to wear darker make-up in an attempt to cover up the dodgy tan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>She explained:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>The worst part was, it took another two weeks for it to completely disappear so I had to wear darker make-up and try not to touch things as I was staining everything.<br/><br/>I was exfoliating my skin until it bled but then I was starting to look like a loaf of tiger bread as my skin started going crusty. It was more annoying because the next day I was going out. I tried everything to cover it up.</blockquote>
      <p>The make-up artist said everyone looked at her skin in a ‘weird’ way following the incident, and only stopped paying attention to her when she explained what had happened.</p>

      <p>While her friends thought it was hilarious and ‘typical’ of Ellena, the teen said her family and mum’s friends weren’t as understanding. ‘[Their] reactions were the worst as they’re older, so they were mortified,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>Ellena said she’s not using fake tan ‘ever again’ following her mishap, and will instead learn to ‘accept [her] English rose skin’ so she doesn’t end up looking ridiculous.</p>
      <p>As much as I feel for her, Ellena, if you’re reading this, could you just try it one more time so we can have another chuckle?</p>
      <p>Please and thank you.</p>
