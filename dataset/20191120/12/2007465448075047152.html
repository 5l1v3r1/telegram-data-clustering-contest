      <h2>Renault reveals all-new, three-row Triber compact MPV in Indonesia</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:57:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>The Megane, Clio, Espace, as well as the Captur are just some of the most notable cars to come from Renault. Whether it's a crossover, hatchback or a minivan, Renault knows a thing or two about making these types of vehicles.</p>
      <p>But what if we told you Renault also made a compact MPV which can compete against the likes of the Toyota Avanza, Suzuki Ertiga, and maybe even the Mitsubishi Xpander. That's exactly what the 2020 Renault Triber is: a three-row MPV that measures less than 4 meters long but can haul more than just the family.</p>

      <p>Officially launched in Indonesia, this tiny people carrier can seat seven, features an SUV-like design, and has a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine.</p>
      <p>Borrowing styling cues from such models like the Captur and the Espace, the Triber comes with Renault's distinct front fascia design. It also comes with projector halogen headlights, a faux front skid plate, and neat bezels on the foglights. Meanwhile, black body cladding on the wheel arches, doors, and rear bumper provide the MPV a more rugged appeal.</p>
      <p>Size-wise, the Triber MPV measures 3990mm long, 1739mm wide, and 1643mm tall (w/o roof rails). It also has a curb weight of 947 kg, making it one of the lightest in the segment. A choice of either 14-inch or 15-inch alloy wheels are also available for the Triber.</p>

      <p>Inside, the cabin of the Triber is traditionally Renault. It has a funky, yet high-tech vibe thanks to a digital instrument display, a sleek touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and voice control, and a unique center console / dashboard design with an engine start/stop button. It also has air-conditioning vents for all three rows in order to keep the passengers comfortable on any trip.</p>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, the Triber has a modular seating configuration which allows users to set it depending on one's needs. With the third row seats folded, it can seat five and carry 625 liters worth of luggage. Deploy the third row seats and it is capable of seating seven but can only lug 84 liters of cargo. You can also fold all the back seats in order to carry a surf board, or maybe small pieces of furniture should the need arise.</p>

      <p>Under the hood, the Triber is powered by a 1.0-liter, naturally-aspirated three-cylinder engine. It puts out a humble 72 PS along with 96 Nm of torque. Power is then shifted to either a five-speed manual gearbox or a five-speed automated manual transmission (AMT).</p>
      <p>With Renault having no plans to set up shop yet in the Philippines, the tiny three-row Triber has a very slim chance to arrive in the Philippines. Moreover, what's interesting is that Renault didn't opt for what Nissan did and talk to fellow Alliance member Mitsubishi about their own version of the Xpander.</p>
