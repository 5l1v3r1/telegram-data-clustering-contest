      <p><b>7Eleven</b> is by far one of the largest convenience stores in the world. Now, there are taking another step to bring convenience to the next level by allowing you to order whatever you want from the nearest store with just your voice. The service will be called <b>7Voice</b> which is one of the features from their delivery app called <b>7Now </b>that<b> </b>is only available in the US.</p>
      <p>Users of 7Now can order from 7Eleven through using voice assistants like <b>Amazon Alexa</b> and <b>Google Home</b>, then the goods will be delivered to their doorsteps from the nearest 7Eleven store. This feature is useful when it comes to you not wanting to head out because of some ‘major events’ are happening at your place, or simply just too lazy to get out. Also, not to mention 7Eleven opens for 24 hours.</p>

      <p>The app works by tracking your real-time location and place your orders at the nearest participating 7Eleven stores. No minimum order is required, but the delivery fee will cost 3.99 USD (~RM16.59). Also, users are able to keep track of the delivery status in the app.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, all of this will only be happening in the US for now. We wish for the day that this service will come to Malaysia and we shall walk or drive no more to 7Eleven. For more cool news like this, stay tuned on TechNave.com.</p>
