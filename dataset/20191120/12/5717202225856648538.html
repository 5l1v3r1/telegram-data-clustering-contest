      <h1>Harry Redknapp responds when asked if Jose Mourinho will sign player for Tottenham</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:45:46+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Harry Redknapp has responded when asked if Jose Mourinho will bring Gareth Bale back to Tottenham Hotspur, by telling Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT (Wednesday, 7.43am) that it would be a great signing.</p>
      <p>Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino on Wednesday morning after the Argentine was relieved of his duties following a dismal start to the 2019-20 campaign. Tottenham sit way down in 14th place in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid superstar Bale, meanwhile, was starring in Wales’ 2-0 win over Hungary which pushed Ryan Giggs’ side into Euro 2020. He has constantly been linked with Tottenham, and continues to be hounded by Real Madrid’s media and fans.</p>
      <p>Bale celebrated with a banner that read “Wales, golf, Madrid. In that order”, on Tuesday night – another sign that his long-term future is unlikely to be at Real. Asked if Bale could return to Spurs, six years after leaving, and Redknapp responded.</p>
      <p>“What a signing he would be for the club. That would get the fans onside straight away. It would be an amazing move, get him right in the good books. His record is second to none, Tottenham have made a good appointment,” Redknapp said.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Should Tottenham sign Bale?</h3>
      <p>It is clear that Bale has no future at Real Madrid. Becoming a centre of criticism from fans, media and now players including Toni Kroos, Bale is also undervalued by Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane. January could see him depart.</p>
      <p>It is believed Bale is earning an enormous £350,000 a week and that kind of salary is way too much for Spurs. If the Wales star is willing to take a pay cut, though, then a move could be engineered.</p>
      <p>The majority Spurs fans are disappointed with the appointment of Mourinho, but bringing Bale back to Spurs would get fans on side.</p>
