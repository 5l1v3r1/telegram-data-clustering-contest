      <p>There may be some actors out there who struggle with Marvel spoilers (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/1/17307438/tom-holland-avengers-infinity-war-spoilers">looking at you, Tom Holland</a>), but Chadwick Boseman is not one of them.</p>
      <p>In the interview above from <i>The Tonight Show</i>, Jimmy Fallon plays the <i>Black Panther</i> star a clip of him on the red carpet, simply saying "I'm dead" over and over whenever he's asked about <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>
      <p>"It was the most fun doing that," laughs Boseman. "It was the first time I had done press, you know, since we shot it, and so I was like, you know, I can make this real easy. I can just come out and say, 'I'm dead.'"</p>
      <p>Well, the technique obviously worked like a charm. But what's he going to do now that <i>Black Panther 2</i> is filming?</p>
      <p>"I don't know what it's going to be this time, I'll come up with something," says Boseman. "I've got to do it tonight before we do the premiere, 'cause I'm on the red carpet tonight."</p>
      <p>Well, it's now the next day and it doesn't look like any <i>Black Panther 2</i> spoilers have leaked overnight, so we're assuming he came up with something.</p>
