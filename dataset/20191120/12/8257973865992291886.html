      <h1>Benny Gantz fails to form coalition, increasing odds of 3rd Israeli election</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:35:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Clyde Hughes &amp; Danielle Haynes</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz on Wednesday told Israeli President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Reuven_Rivlin/?tps=1">Reuven Rivlin</a> he's unable to form a new coalition government, increasing the odds of yet another election in the Middle Eastern country.</p>
      <p>His announcement came after a meeting with Prime Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Benjamin_Netanyahu/?tps=1">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> late Tuesday, as a last-ditch effort to come to an agreement before a deadline Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The formation of a coalition government appeared to hinge on <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Avigdor_Lieberman/?tps=1">Avigdor Lieberman</a>, the leader of the influential Yisrael Beytenu Party. Liberman was <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Liberman-set-to-decide-fate-of-coalition-608403">expected to decide</a> whether to support Netanyahu or Gantz, but ultimately determined he <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-gantz-meet-lieberman-israel-election-unity-government-1.8136896">couldn't support</a> a minority government.</p>
      <p>Liberman has urged Netanyahu's Likud Party and Gantz's Blue and White Party to compromise -- and the two leaders attempted to win his support.</p>
      <p>Israeli is now likely headed for its third election in less than a year, after votes in April and September.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu was first given the task of forming a coalition by Rivlin after neither party won enough Knesset seats in September to create a majority government. When he failed, Gantz was given the same mandate.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5628888,00.html">made clear Wednesday</a> he is not interested in any scenario that sees him vacate his current post as leader of Israel.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, during our meeting last night, Benny Gantz refused to accept the president's outline that I, as prime minister, will be the first in rotation for the premiership," he said of a proposal that would make he and Gantz co-prime ministers.</p>
      <p>Gantz, meanwhile, has rejected the right-wing-religious bloc built by Netanyahu for his coalition, saying a unity government "cannot be built on a sectoral bloc."</p>
