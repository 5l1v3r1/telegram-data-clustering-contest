      </p>
      <p><i>Cats</i> star Francesca Hayward has discussed the controversial use of CGI in the new live-action film.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/cats-watch-taylor-swift-idris-elba-and-judi-dench-star-in-new-trailer-2569538">The second trailer for one of the year’s most divisive films</a> came out yesterday (November 19).</p>

      </ul>
      <p>There has been a lot of talk around the use of technology in the new film, which comes out on December 20, and Hayward admits that the criticism around the CGI in <i>Cats</i> “took a while to process”.</p>
      <p>“It takes time maybe, for people to wrap their heads around the whole thing,” she told <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/cats-the-film-francesca-hayward-interview-a4290561.html"><i>The Evening Standard</i></a>. Maybe they are comments from people who haven’t seen the musical.</p>
      <p>“If they had been on the sets themselves, [they would’ve seen] they were absolutely extraordinary. It was like a playground for us. We really did feel cat-sized compared to everything we were seeing and everything that was around us.”</p>

      <p>She continued: “When I saw the trailer, I hadn’t seen myself with fur yet. We recorded in the motion capture suits and the fur was digitally added.</p>
      <p>“It took me a while to process myself as a cat – it’s not something you see every day.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/theyre-not-real-ian-mckellen-defends-cats-controversial-use-cgi-2565558">Ian McKellen became the first cast member to defend the film’s controversial use of CGI</a>.</p>
      <p>“The stage show, Cats, was not about a lot of people being convincing as cats, but it was about human beings discovering their cat-like nature,” McKellen said. “And it was hugely successful.”</p>
