        <b>Ed Carpenter has denied rumours that <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a> will be joining his team in IndyCar in 2020, as his time in F1 looks to be up following the season finale in just over a week's time. Hulkenberg is out of options in F1, having been replaced at Renault by Esteban Ocon.</b>

      <p>The German had previously ruled out IndyCar as he is not prepared to take on the oval races, but rumours had started generating pace again and Carpenter says that he did speak to Hulkenberg about the position.</p>

      <p>Carpenter told Motorsport.com that he will continue to drive the oval races for his team, but denies Hulkenberg will join him on the team.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“Yes, I will continue as an oval driver in the #20 Chevy next season. It's unbelievable, every year someone starts a rumour or predicts that I will retire, but that is absolutely not the case. These rumours got out of hand without one of us saying anything."</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“To be honest, I did talk to Nico a few times. I think IndyCar intrigues him, but I think this is not the right time for him."</i>
