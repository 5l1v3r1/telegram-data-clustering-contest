      <p>IN THE Rochestown Road area detached properties which have an acre of grounds and views across the estuary are very rare to the market. That’s according to Conor Smith of Casey &amp; Kingston who says the availability of this four-bed detached called Rockville as “a one-off opportunity to acquire a one-off house on a one-off site”.</p>
      <p>The 1,300sq ft property was built in 2000 by the current owners who have minded it well and also spent time planting and tending the mature sloping gardens which surround it.</p>
      <p>Downstairs accommodation includes a timber-floored sitting room with a fireplace as well as a kitchen-diner with oak units in addition to a bathroom and two bedrooms.</p>
      <p>The larger of the two upstairs bedrooms has an en suite and a balcony with scenic views of Rochestown Estuary. Rockville has an attached garage and a large patio and its site, which slopes down towards the water, is mostly lawned. There’s large gravel area near the house for parking, barbecuing and playing, while further up the garden there’s an area for sitting out and enjoying the view.</p>

      <p>One of three properties which share an access from the Rochestown Road, Rockville is located five kilometres from Douglas. “The site is fabulous and the views from the upstairs windows are magnificent,” says Mr Smith, who is seeking offers of €495,000.</p>
      <p>VERDICT: In this location a house with a site of this size is expected to sell well.</p>
