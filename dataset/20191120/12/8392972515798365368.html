      <p>Gillian was one of the more memorable contestants of I'm A Celebrity series 10, during which she was so terrified she suffered fainting fits.</p>
      <p>Looking back on her jungle stint, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/gillian-mckeith-complains-of-being-forced-into-frumpy-outfit-for-loose-women/">Gillian</a> admitted she is able to "laugh about it" today, although she thinks she's "suffering from PTSD" as a result of what she experienced Down Under.</p>

      <p>She told <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tv/im-celebs-gillian-mckeith-says-20900227">The Daily Star</a>: "When I look back at the jungle, it's like the stuff of nightmares. It was like being in a horror movie, to be honest. And I'm not certain I've fully recovered.</p>
      <aside>I honestly think I'm suffering from PTSD.</aside>
      <p>"I do laugh about it. But the funny thing is though, every day since I left the jungle, to the present day, I'm reminded of the jungle constantly - by strangers, by taxi drivers - everywhere I go, as if it was yesterday."</p>
      <p>Speaking further, the Scottish presenter said the trials are now "a bit of a blur" but were definitely "all horrible".</p>
      <p>She added: "There wasn't a single trial I enjoyed, not even one. I honestly think I'm suffering from PTSD."</p>

      <p>So far, those who have been unfortunate enough to take on the bushtucker trials have handled the challenges with varying degrees of bravery.</p>
      <p>One of the stand-out stars of last night's (19.11.19) bushtucker was former soap star Jacqueline Jossa.</p>

      <p>The ex <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress took part in a trial called Face Your Fears along with campmates Andrew Maxwell, James Haskell, Ian Wright and Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>Jac was clearly the most terrified of the celebrities doing the trial.</p>
      <p>But when she had to put the dreaded glass bowl over her head and attempt to procure two stars as her headgear was filled with huge spiders, she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jacqueline-jossas-tears-despite-nailing-bushtucker-trial/">overcame her fears and absolutely smashed the trial</a>.</p>
