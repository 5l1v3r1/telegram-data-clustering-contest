      <h1>The North Tyneside streets where you can park for free to do your Christmas shopping</h1>
      <h2>North Tyneside Council is bringing in free weekend parking in North Shields, Whitley Bay, Walllsend and Tynemouth in December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:20:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sonia Sharma</a></address>
      <p>Shoppers will be able to park for free at weekends in North Tyneside's town centres in the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">North Tyneside Council</a> is making on-street parking free in the borough's town centres on Saturdays and Sundays throughout December.</p>
      <p>The aim is to encourage people to visit shops in North Shields, Wallsend, Whitley Bay and Tynemouth.</p>
      <p>There are already free spaces available in some council-managed car parks, as well as Priors Haven in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tynemouth">Tynemouth</a> .</p>
      <p>But, all next month, motorists will be able to park for free at weekends on streets where restrictions usually apply. Scroll down to see the full list of the streets.</p>
      <p>Phil Scott, the council's head of environment, housing and leisure, said: "We are committed to doing all we can to ensure the borough is a vibrant and attractive place to visit.</p>
      <p>"There are already many great reasons to visit <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside’s</a> town and village centres this Christmas, such as our Winter Festival and Christmas lights displays.</p>
      <p>"Providing free on-street parking at weekends throughout December is another great way to support our local businesses and the local economy in what is a really important time, ahead of Christmas."</p>

      <p>Scott Glazebrook, owner of Hamiedog Menswear in Park View, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/whitley-bay">Whitley Bay</a> , said: "As a small independent business we are extremely pleased that the council is again offering free weekend parking this year.</p>
      <p>"Christmas is our busiest period and whilst car parking is often a hot topic of conversation, by making things easier for shoppers to get about is going to be a big help not only for retailers like us but also for the many new coffee shops, bars and restaurants which have recently opened in the area.</p>
      <p>"We're looking forward to another successful festive shopping month with local people taking advantage of the free parking and shopping local. It really does make a difference."</p>
      <p>On-street parking is already free on Sundays in the borough’s town centres.</p>
      <p>During December, this will be extended to Saturdays in town centres and to Saturdays and Sundays in Front Street, Tynemouth. Ticket machines will be temporarily suspended in the locations.</p>
