      <p>This week's WWE RAW kicked off with a tag team match between The IIconics and Becky Lynch and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/charlotte-flair">Charlotte Flair</a>. As soon as The Man and The Queen picked up the win over the former WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, NXT's <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/shayna-baszler">Shayna Baszler</a>, Marina Shafir and Jessamyn Duke showed up and attempted to take them out. Unfortunately, they couldn't get the job done and had to retreat for the night.</p>
      <h3>Charlotte Flair's comment on the invasion</h3>
      <p>Charlotte Flair, who is the captain of the women's team for RAW, was interviewed backstage following the NXT invasion and The Queen sent out a loud and clear message for the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> Superstars.</p>
      <blockquote>So I'm NXT homegrown. I'm from NXT, I was a former NXT Women's Champion. I know what it's like to be at NXT and wanna come to RAW and SmackDown and make a name for yourself and takeover, have that eagerness. But there's one thing they need to know, they will find out quickly, they are just a bunch of little kids playing with a Queen.</blockquote>

      <p>Under the captaincy of Charlotte Flair, Natalya, Sarah Logan, Asuka and Kairi Sane are set to represent RAW at Survivor Series where they battle Team NXT and Team SmackDown.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see whether The Queen lives up to her words at the event or the Black-and-Gold brand shocks the WWE Universe and emerges as the victor.</p>
