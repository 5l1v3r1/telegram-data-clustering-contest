      <p>Cambridge United boss Colin Calderwood slammed his side's defending that led to Alex Fisher's winner for Exeter City in last night's FA Cup replay as “absolute nonsense.”</p>
      <p>Fisher grabbed the winner with 20 minutes to go to book the Grecians spot in the Second Round in a game that saw few chances for either side.</p>
      <p>He volleyed the ball in at the near post from an Ben Seymour cross, after the City youngster had been played in by Archie Collins.</p>
      <p>Calderwood, speaking after the game, said his side didn't do enough going forward but that the defending for the goal was a nonsense, <a href="https://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/sport/colin-calderwood-reacts-cambridge-uniteds-17284585">CambridgeshireLive reports.</a></p>
      <p>“I don’t think we had enough of those moments where we produced anything with any reasonable level of quality that might have troubled them,” the U’s head coach said.</p>

      <p>“Certainly there were two or three moments first half where we found a nice move – one of which was called offside – but in the second half everything came from so deep in our own half and we haven’t troubled their goalie at all.</p>
      <p>“I have to say, if we can’t defend that movement for their goal, we’re in real trouble. That is nonsense, absolute nonsense. Everyone is in a shape, everyone is in a position and it can’t go in, but it does.</p>
      <p>“Listen, we’ve frustrated them, we were waiting for a moment of inspiration and [it didn’t come].  Through that period, you got a feeling they started to get a little bit more on top, and a little bit more dangerous, in the end the team with the greater attacking quality tonight has won the game.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “It can’t, shouldn’t [be a goal]. You stand here with your fingers crossed that it won’t go in, in the future, because it’s next to rubbish in the alphabet.”</p>
      <p>Exeter City will now host Hartlepool United in the Second Round, with the game kicking off at 2pm on Sunday, December 1.</p>
