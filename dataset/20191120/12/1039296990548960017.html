      <p>Mechanically, the BS6 Maruti BS6 Wagon R 1.0 is identical to the BS4 model and comes with the same 5-speed manual and 5-speed AMT gearbox options. The upgrade to BS6-spec has seen the ARAI-rated fuel-efficiency figures drop by 0.71kpl, from 22.5kpl to 21.79kpl. Interestingly, this mileage figure is slightly more than the recently launched S-Presso’s 21.4-21.7kpl figure – Maruti’s newest model is powered by the same 68hp, 998cc, three-cylinder K10B petrol engine.</p>
      <p>The minor increase in prices means that sales of the hot-selling tall-boy hatchback are not expected to be impacted in the least. Other than the shift to BS6-compliancy, nothing else has changed. Maruti Suzuki’s senior executive director, CV Raman, had recently told Autocar India that the share of <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/share-of-bs6-cars-in-maruti-suzukis-monthly-sales-crosses-70-percent-mark-414945"><b>BS6 cars in the carmaker’s monthly sales has crossed “over 70 percent”</b></a> and that the brand is working towards 100 percent sales from BS6 models within three months. The BS6 Wagon R 1.0 should help in that regard.</p>
      <p>The third-gen Maruti Suzuki Wagon R has undoubtedly built on its predecessor’s strengths and is a sensible, spacious, efficient and reasonably priced city hatchback. The latest model is available in a total of 14 versions – six of them come with the 1.0 petrol engine (with manual and AMT options), two come with a BS4-compliant CNG-powered engine (Rs 4.99-5.06 lakh), and six come with the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/bs6-compliant-maruti-suzuki-wagon-r-launched-at-rs-510-lakh-413118"><b>BS6-compliant 1.2-litre K12B petrol engine</b></a> (also with manual and AMT gearbox options and priced from Rs 5.10-5.91 lakh.)</p>
