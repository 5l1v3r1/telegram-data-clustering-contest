      <h1>Tory who said Brit Jews return from Israel as ‘brainwashed extremists’ suspended</h1>
      <h2>Amjad Bashir, who had been the MP candidate for Leeds North East, made the anti-semitic remarks in a European parliament debate on Gaza while he was a UKIP MEP</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:24:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>The Tories have suspended an MP candidate who said that British Jews return from Israel trips as ‘brainwashed extremists’.</p>
      <p>Amjad Bashir has apologised for the comments, made in a speech to the European parliament while he was a UKIP MEP in 2014.</p>
      <p>He is a candidate for Leeds North East where there is a large Jewish community.</p>
      <p>In a European parliament debate on Gaza in 2014, Mr Bashir said: “As far as brainwashing by the rabbis and the politicians are concerned – I can testify to that.</p>
      <p>“Young men are going over from England where I come from – people of the Jewish faith who my grandchildren have grown up with as decent young men.</p>

      <p>“But have come back as extremists – as people that are brainwashed. They will not listen to reason. There is something very peculiar and wrong going on in Israel.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bashier apologised this week for the comments and said he intends to meet local Jewish groups and travel to Israel "to gain direct experience from the situation on the ground there".</p>
      <p>A Conservative spokesman said: “Mr Bashir has been suspended from the party pending investigation and election support has been withdrawn."</p>

      <p>A pro-Brexit restaurateur, Mr Bashir was elected as a UKIP MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber in 2014 before he defected to the Conservatives in 2015.</p>
      <p>When his comments re-emerged, he said: "I want to make unambiguously clear that these are not views I hold now. I apologise unreservedly for the comments I made and the distress they have caused within the Jewish community and other groups,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I am ready to meet with the Board of Deputies of British Jews at their earliest possible convenience so they can hear from me directly. I also intend to meet with local Jewish community groups in Leeds North East. </p>
      <p>“I recognise I owe them an apology in person.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday the Tories <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-tory-suspended-after-20911827">also suspended Ryan Houghton</a>, the Conservative candidate for Aberdeen North, after it emerged he had suggested some elements of the Holocaust were "fabricated".</p>
      <p>He also stated Muslims were having big families in big to create "Eurabia" and said he didn't see how homosexuality was good for the human race.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> called for him to be expelled from the Tory party.</p>

      <p>SNP candidate for Aberdeen North Kirsty Blackman said: "These comments are utterly horrifying and voters will be appalled that the Tories considered Mr Houghton a suitable candidate."</p>
      <p>Mr Bashir was elected to the European Parliament for Ukip in 2014, but defected to the Conservatives the following year and served as an MEP until this year’s elections.</p>
