      <p>“I’m John Mulaney and I am a 37 year old man,” says comedian <b>John Mulaney</b> of his just-announced upcoming Netflix special that takes the form of an old-school kids variety special. “The Sack Lunch Bunch is a group of children ages 8-13 who are more talented than me.”</p>
      <p>In <i>John Mulaney &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch</i>, they’re joined by <b>David Byrne,</b> Tony-winning actor <b>Andre De Shields</b>, <b>Natasha Lyonne, Annaleigh Ashford, Shereen Pimentel, Richard Kind</b>, and <b>Jake Gyllenhaal</b> (“from the movie Zodiac,” says John). “The result is a collage of Broadway caliber showstoppers, comedy sketches for all ages, meditations on the unknown from children and adults, and a papier mache volcano. It’s funny, musical, joyous, anxious, and surprisingly profound.”</p>
      <p>This awesome-sounding special, directed by John’s <i>Documentary Now!/<a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/john-mulaney-adds-5th-radio-city-show-to-tour-appeared-on-colbert/">Comeback Kid</a></i> collaborator <b>Rhys Thomas,</b> drops Christmas Eve (December 24) on Netflix.</p>
