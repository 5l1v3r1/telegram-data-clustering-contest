      <p>Russia's belief that Turkey had been considering resuming its operation in northern Syria was a "misunderstanding," Russia's top diplomat, Sergey Lavrov, said Wednesday.<br/><br/>Turkey informed Russia's ambassador in Ankara that there was no talk of a resumption of Turkey's Operation Peace Spring, Lavrov said in comments carried by the Russian news agency Interfax.<br/><br/>Lavrov told reporters that the withdrawal of the People's Protection Units (YPG) has been "practically completed" adding: "There are maybe some individual areas where this matter still needs to be finished."<br/><br/>Lavrov criticized the YPG for having sought protection from the United States, arguing that they must engage in direct dialogue with the Bashar Assad regime, which Russia supports.<br/><br/>There have been dozens of attacks by YPG forces in Syria. Turkey and Russia have completed eight joint patrols in the region following the completion of the 150-hour withdrawal period as per the deal.<br/><br/>Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring, the third in a series of cross-border anti-terror operations in northern Syria targeting terrorists affiliated with Daesh and the PKK's Syrian offshoot the YPG, on Oct. 9.<br/><br/>The operation, conducted in line with the country's right to self-defense borne out of international law and U.N. Security Council resolutions, aims to establish a terror-free safe zone for Syrians return in the area east of the Euphrates River controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which is dominated by YPG terrorists.<br/><br/>Ankara agreed with Washington on Oct. 17 to pause its operation to allow the YPG/PKK terrorists to withdraw from the planned safe zone.<br/><br/>On Oct. 22, Ankara and Moscow reached a deal under which YPG/PKK terrorists were to pull back 30 kilometers south of Turkey's border with Syria within 150 hours, and security forces from Turkey and Russia would mount joint patrols there.<br/><br/>The PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union, has waged a terror campaign against Turkey for more than 30 years, resulting in the deaths of nearly 40,000 people, including women, children and infants.</p>
