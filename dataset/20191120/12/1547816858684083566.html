        <b>Recently, Kamya Panjabi’s beau Shalabh Dang took to his social media to pour out his love for his fiance. Replying to Dang’s post, a social media troll says Kamya is a ‘2 rupees woman’ and she’ll sell her daughter, in anger, Shalabh lashed out the person for passing derogatory remarks.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss ex-contestant <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/kamya-panjabi">Kamya Panjabi</a> is an avid Sidharth Shukla fan and constantly extends her support towards the Bigg Boss 13 contestant. Recently after Asim Riaz and Sidharth’s fight in the house, Kamya pointed out that Asim deliberately started the fight with Sidharth and that he should have not done it. Meanwhile, Kamya’s beau Shalabh Dang took to his social media to share a picture with his ladylove. While Dang shared the picture, Kamya Panjabi received a backlash from a troll. Enraged by the ill-spoken against his ladylove Kamya, Shalabh lashes out at the troll on social media.<br/><br/> Kamya Panjabi’s beau <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/shalabh-dang">Shalabh Dang</a> took to his Twitter to post a love soaked picture with his ladylove. The tweet shared by Dang read, “I promise that you would wear this content expression on your face, always @iamkamyapunjabi #love #trust #care,” pouring out his love on the beautiful Kamya. Meanwhile, this particular post shared by Shalabh didn’t go down well for an Anti-Sidharth Shukla troll on social media.

      <p>While Shalabh shared his tweet for Kamya Panjabi expressing his love, an Anti-Sidharth Shukla troll replied to Dang’s tweet and spoke ill of the Ex-Bigg Boss contestant as she supports Shukla and disregards another woman on the reality show. The tweet made by the troll read, “Why are you with this bekaar 2 rupeesaurat Kamya. She is stooping so low degrading other women on a reality show. She will sell her own daughter for her pleasure. In the tweet, the troll questioned Shalabh on why is he dating Kamya and called her ‘bekaar’ and ‘2 rupees aurat’ as she is stooping low by disregarding women on the show.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the troll went on to further add that Kamya will sell her own daughter for her pleasure, which left Shalabh in shock. Enraged by the comments made on Kamya and her daughter, Shalabh replied asking the troll to at least have the B*lls to put on a real picture. Dang replied, “Hey listen, whoever you r first have the balls to put your real pic. Who gave you the rights to talk such ill words about a woman and her innocent daughter ?? You surely need medical help !!” shutting out the troll forever. As Shalabh lashed out at the troll, he also questions him about who gave him the right to talk such ill words about a woman and her innocent daughter.</p>
