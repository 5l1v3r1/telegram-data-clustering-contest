      <h1>New contracts at Nottingham Forest? Why the board should bide their time and see out Christmas</h1>
      <h2>Two-time European Cup winner Garry Birtles assess talk of new contracts at Nottingham Forest</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:43:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>There’s been plenty of talk about Sabri Lamouchi and a possible new contract at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>, and you can entirely understand why given the impact he’s had since arriving in the summer.</p>
      <p>For me, though, there’s no need to rush that at the moment.</p>
      <p>Let him do his job and do it wel,l because if he keeps churning out results like he has done so far, then it’ll take care of itself when the time is right.</p>
      <p>We all know just how cutthroat football is, and it’s important the club don’t saddle themselves down with a lengthy financial commitment that they may, at some point, need to get out of.</p>
      <p>If Lamouchi and Forest come through the next month or so still in the thick of the promotion race then fine, look at it, certainly in the New Year when things have settled down a little, there's no need at this juncture.</p>

      <p>The club will most likely wait and see how the Reds get through the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/dangerous-bristol-city-coach-issues-3556364">busy and dangerous Christmas period</a>, one which they’ve notoriously struggled in previously.</p>
      <p>At the moment, we’re still far too early into the campaign to start thinking about handing out deals – a lot can change.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-bosses-latest-derby-3418030">We all know what the Championship is like</a>, it’s quite conceivable that Forest would go on and lose the next six games and then the landscape would look quite different, wouldn’t it?</p>
      <p>Just look at last month.</p>
      <p>Forest lost at Wigan before Hull City came to the City Ground and won fairly comfortably.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, there was a bit of pressure on Lamouchi and his players when they went to Luton, though thankfully they got a very good result.</p>

      <p>Imagine things were different and that win was a defeat, you’re then going into the Derby game with three in a row with momentum going the wrong way.</p>
      <p>That’s how quickly things can change in this league and we should focus on keeping that points tally growing nicely with another three or four over the next couple of away trips, ones which are far from easy.</p>
      <p>I’d suggest that the way things are now probably work for all parties, just bide your time and see what’s what.</p>
      <p>The transfer window is also of paramount importance for the club given their current position in the table so the club focusing on that is key.</p>
      <p>What a chance this club will have over the next few months.</p>
      <p>Assuming, as it looks like they will, that Forest will be challenging, you’d expect the manager to be given money to strengthen, I’m certain that they’ll want to go and push on and grasp this opportunity to get back into the Premier League.</p>
