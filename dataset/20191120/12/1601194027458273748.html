      <h3>Kenny Omega as the AAA Mega Champion</h3>
      <p>The Best Bout Machine won the AAA Mega Championship by defeating Rey Fenix at AAA's pay-per-view event Heroes Immortales XIII. In a post-match interview, Omega said that he was willing to bring the Mega Championship title to AEW and was willing to defend it in both AAA and AEW.</p>
      <p>Now, it seems like Omega is keeping his word as he will be defending the title for the first time against Jack Evans. Evans, on the other hand, has been teaming up with Angelico as the tag team The Hybrid 2 and is slated to have his first big singles match in AEW.</p>
      <p>Omega had a brutal Unsanctioned Lights Out match with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/dean-ambrose">Jon Moxley</a> at <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/aew-full-gear">AEW Full Gear</a> where he was defeated. Both the stars left the match with gruesome injuries and Omega, in particular, was not medically cleared by the doctors from competing in last week's episode of Dynamite.</p>
