      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/commerce-ministry">commerce ministry </a>on Wednesday said the Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) has taken various measures to protect <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/domestic-industry">domestic industry </a>from unfair trade practices.</p>
      <p>Consequently, the number of anti-dumping duty cases has risen from 5 in 2016 to 25 up to November 1, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It also said streamlining of the anti-dumping investigation process has reduced the number of days taken for initiating such probes and has led to a reduction in the number of cases.</p>
      <p>Expeditious processing of applications has eliminated the need for the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/domestic-industry">domestic industry </a>to update information and data, it said.</p>
      <p>"DGTR has, for the first time, initiated two cases of bilateral safeguards this year. No bilateral safeguard case has ever been initiated in the past," it added.</p>
      <p>There has also been a reduction in the number of actual days taken to initiate investigations.</p>
      <p>Average number of days taken for initiation of anti-dumping investigations during this year is 32 days as compared to 110 days during 2017 and 259 in 2016, it said.</p>
      <p>Further, steps taken by DGTR has provided a level-playing field for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/domestic-industry">domestic industry </a>and the average number of days taken for initiation of countervailing duties (CVD) cases during 2019 was 66 days as compared to an average of 72 days in 2018.</p>
      <p>The actual average number of days taken for initiation of global safeguards at present is 61 days as compared to the standard 75 days earlier, it said.</p>
