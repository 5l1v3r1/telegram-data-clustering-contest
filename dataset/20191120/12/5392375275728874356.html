      <p>Chinese manufacturing giant, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a>, has a couple of projectors in the market. These projectors have different prices and qualities with its ANSI lumens reaching 9000. However, the company also has projectors with much lower ANSI lumens (900 – 1500) which are cheaper for obvious reasons. Most of Xiaomi’s projectors are from Mijia and they have been doing quite well. Now, we have a new projector from the company – Xiaomi Mijia 2400 ANSI lumens laser projector.</p>
