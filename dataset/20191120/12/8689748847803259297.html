      <p>According to EL in an interview on Hitz FM his fame has contributed to his decision not to go to church.</p>
      <p>“The last time I went to church I ended up taking pictures with fans and Jesus wasn’t happy”. He stated..</p>
      <p>EL further bemoaned that all he wants is to worship God in peace and he is ready to resume that role should he find a church that can give him that.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t stopped going to church, I’m just looking for a church that i can be myself and worship in peace”. He stated.</p>
      <p>E.L in his final statement added that this hasn’t affected his spirituality in anyway because he still prays to God and worship Him at home.</p>
