      <p>Bhageerathi Amma, who always yearned to study and gain knowledge, had to give up her dream of educating herself after her mother passed away as she had to take care of her younger siblings.</p>
      <p>Fate dealt her another blow when she lost her husband in her 30s following which the entire responsiblity of bringing up her six children, including 4 daugthers, fell on her shoulders.</p>
