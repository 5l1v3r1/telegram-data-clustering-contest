      <h1>Health board moves to allay fears over flu vaccinations for EK kids</h1>
      <h2>Children across the region were facing missing out on the vaccination before winter because of supply issues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:32:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser N Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-n-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>NHS Lanarkshire have moved to quash fears over the supply of vital flu vaccinations.</p>
      <p>We told you last week how a delivery of the inoculation, due to arrive later this month, faced being delayed because of lab testing.</p>
      <p>Developed by Astrazeneca, the simple nasal spray was scheduled for repeat testing on some batches of the vaccine.</p>
      <p>That meant that children across the region faced missing out on the vaccination before winter.</p>
      <p>But the health board have this week said they expect their supply to “quickly improve ahead of winter,” meaning the fight against flu is back on.</p>
      <p>The health baord’s public health medicine consultant, Dr David Cromie, said: “The local impact on delivery of flu vaccines has been very limited to date, with appointments for two to five year olds and planned school vaccine sessions being unaffected by the national supply issues.</p>
      <p>“The additional supplies we have now received are welcome and will give us the ability to more freely supply Lanarkshire GP practices going forward.</p>
      <p>“We continue to encourage all parents and carers to ensure their children are protected against influenza.”</p>
      <p>Four batches of the Fluenz Tetra nasal spray have now passed quality control tests and stock has been made available quicker than expected.</p>
      <p>The supply issue does not impact vaccinations for adults who are eligible for the flu jab, which includes those with breathing problems, diabetes, heart and kidney conditions, those over 65-years old and pregnant women.</p>
      <p>Dr Cromie said: “I realise some people are still hesitant about the safety of immunisations.</p>
      <p>“I wish to emphasise the facts show influenza vaccination is safe and if you or your child are not protected, you could become very unwell and indeed spread it on to your family and friends.</p>
      <p>“Getting vaccinated is a quick and easy step to protect your and your family’s health.”</p>
      <p>The vaccination programme is expected to eventually prevent an estimated 200 deaths and 1100 hospitalisations a year.</p>
