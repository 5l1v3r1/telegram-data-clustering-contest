      <p>Tendulkar, who had retired from international cricket this week six years ago, had shed a few tears on the field during his last Test, which had been played at the Wankhede, his home ground.</p>
      <p>Referring to that day, Tendulkar said, “I felt stronger for putting myself out there and grateful for everything that I had received. There’s no shame in showing your tears. So why hide a part of you that actually makes you stronger?”</p>
      <p>Tendulkar’s note comes on the occasion of the ongoing International Men’s Week.</p>
      <p>Talking about showing tears and the notion that crying makes men weak, Tendulkar’s letter says: “Undoubtedly there will be times when you fail, and you will feel like crying and letting it all out. But sure enough, you’ll hold back the tears and pretend to be tough. Because that’s what men do. Because that’s what we are brought up to believe – that men are not supposed to cry. That crying makes a man weak.</p>
      <p>“I grew up believing this. And the reason I’m writing to you today, is because I realized that I was wrong.”</p>
