      <p>Among the stories that piqued the interest of our readers was the unveiling of Teneo as the new sponsor of Tipperary hurlers, a breakdown of penalty points offences in Ireland and world class reporting from the local elections in May.</p>
      <p>Figures also revealed that the people of Tipperary just can't get enough of property stories, and Dermot Bannon, with the famous architect appearing is two of our most read articles in the last year. </p>
