      <h3>Time to take on the Undying Mind, Guardians.</h3>
      <p>The <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> </i>Vex Offensive Final Assault is now available, a new event that’ll take Guardians to the end of the game’s current season.</p>
      <p>From now until 10 December, players can play a heightened version of the Vex Offensive complete with a new boss battle in the form of the Undying Mind. To activate the Final Assault version of the event, head over to the Moon and look for the activity in the bottom right of the Director. Make sure you head on over to Ikora at the Tower and load up on Bounties beforehand, though.</p>
      <p>Collectively, Guardians around the world will need to defeat the Undying Mind as many times as possible. Indivially, you’ll need to do so at least three times to earn the<b> Final Assault </b>Triumph.</p>
      <p>Have fun, Guardians!</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> </i>is available now on Windows PC, Xbox One, PS4 and Stadia.</p>
