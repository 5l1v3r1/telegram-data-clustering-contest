      <h1>Liberman to decide Israel's next step after Netanyahu-Gantz meet fails</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:35:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Clyde Hughes</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- It appears that it will be up to Israeli politician Avigdor Liberman Wednesday whether there will be a new coalition government -- or yet another election.</p>
      <p>The leader of the influential Yisrael Beytenu Party, Liberman is <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Politics-And-Diplomacy/Liberman-set-to-decide-fate-of-coalition-608403">expected to decide</a> whether to support Prime Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Benjamin_Netanyahu/?tps=1">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> or opposition leader Benny Gantz, or neither.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu and Gantz failed to produce a new unity government after meeting late Tuesday in a last-ditch effort before a deadline Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Liberman has urged Netanyahu's Likud Party and Gantz's Blue and White Party to compromise -- and the two leaders have attempted to win his support, which is key in forming a new government coalition. If Liberman supports neither, Israel would likely be headed for its third election in less than a year.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu was first given the task of forming a coalition by Israeli President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Reuven_Rivlin/?tps=1">Reuven Rivlin</a> after neither party won enough Knesset seats in September to create a majority government. When he failed, Gantz was given the same mandate. He faces a deadline Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu and Gantz have blamed each other for failed unity talks and called on Liberman to support their minority coalitions.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5628888,00.html">made clear Wednesday</a> he is not interested in any scenario that sees him vacate his current post as leader of Israel.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, during our meeting last night, Benny Gantz refused to accept the president's outline that I, as prime minister, will be the first in rotation for the premiership," he said of a proposal that would make he and Gantz co-prime ministers.</p>
      <p>Gantz, meanwhile, has rejected the right-wing-religious bloc built by Netanyahu for his coalition, saying a unity government "cannot be built on a sectoral bloc."</p>
