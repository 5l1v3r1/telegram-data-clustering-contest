      <p>Cook is seen as unusually deft in his dealings with the U.S. president, especially given Apple’s opposition to some administration policies. One reason: Apple has kept production of the high-end Mac Pro in the United States, rather than moving it abroad.</p>
      <p>Following are tweets and quotes from Trump to and about “Tim” as well as comments from Cook on some potential flashpoints.</p>
      <h3>TRUMP ON LATEST IPHONE</h3>

      <p>** April 25, 2018: Says he would be talking to Cook about “many things, including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade.”</p>
      <p>** Sept. 8, 2018: Tweets Apple’s prices may rise because of the tariffs to be imposed on China, “-but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax, and indeed a tax incentive. Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now. Exciting!#MAGA”</p>
      <p>** Sept. 30: Calls Apple’s opting to build its new Mac Pro in Texas “great news”, says, “it means hundreds of American jobs in Austin and for suppliers across the Country. Congratulations to the Apple team and their workers!”</p>
