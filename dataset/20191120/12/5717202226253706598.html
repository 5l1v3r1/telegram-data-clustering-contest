      <h1>As Newcastle struggle for goals, one former striker target is thriving</h1>

      <p>Newcastle United have been improving in recent weeks under Steve Bruce, but arguably one key issue still remains.</p>
      <p>The Magpies are still having a bit of trouble scoring goals.</p>
      <p>In their 12 Premier League games so far, they have managed to score just 11, with new signing Joelinton having netted just once, and Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almiron both yet to get off the mark.</p>

      <p>Thankfully Bruce appears to have a fairly solid defence, which is giving them a chance of nicking goals to secure points.</p>
      <p>One wonders if Bruce will dip into the transfer market in January for attacking reinforcements.</p>
      <p>As Newcastle struggle in front of goal, one of their reported former targets is thriving after his summer transfer.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Thuram the one that got away?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-arsenal-newcastle-step-up-interest-in-ligue-1-ace">TEAMtalk claimed</a> in January that then-Guingamp striker Marcus Thuram was on former manager Rafa Benitez’s radar.</p>
      <p>Newcastle never moved, and then stood by as Borussia Monchengladbach swooped for him in the summer for €12 million/£10 million (<a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/gladbach-sign-marcus-thuram-in-12m-deal/2aqwbgpwpts115qreni2jhe9n">Goal</a>).</p>

      <p>The move has been a huge success so far, with the electric Thuram scoring eight goals and making five assists in 17 appearances. He is already closing in on his tally of 13 from last season.</p>
      <p>22-year-old Thuram – son of legendary French defender Lilian – has been a regular for Marco Rose’s side, featuring through the middle and on the wings.</p>
      <p>His contributions have helped Gladbach surge to the top of the Bundesliga after 11 games, and it’s looking very much as though Newcastle slept on him during their chaotic summer.</p>
