      <h1>I’m A Celebrity fans predict Adele Roberts will be first to leave after clash with Roman Kemp</h1>
      <h2>She caused a stir last night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:23:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Rebecca Carter</a></address>
      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> think Adele Roberts will be the first celebrity to be voted out.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday's show, the radio DJ clashed with campmate Roman Kemp when he claimed "no-one knows" who Jane McDonald is after <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/jane-mcdonald-responds-to-being-adele-roberts-luxury-item-on-im-a-celebrity/">it was revealed her luxury item</a> was a photo of the former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> star.</p>
      <p>Adele was one of only two campmates to successfully retrieve their luxury item on Monday's episode but many of the campmates were confused.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The photo was then tied up to a tree in camp.</p>
      <p>On last night's show, Kate Garraway said: "Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?"</p>
      <p>Adele confessed: "I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.</p>
      <p>"She’ll cruise around the world, for example she’d go to Iceland and then sing a Bjork or would go to the USA and sing Proud Mary."</p>
      <p>Roman and Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson started to laugh and Adele became upset.</p>
      <p>Capital FM DJ Roman said: "It’s just random mate."</p>

      <p>Adele hit back: "Why though? I don’t understand. If I had brought in a picture of Ru-Paul would you have the same reaction?</p>
      <p>"That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want. It’s like you’re saying 'why would I like Jane McDonald?'"</p>
      <aside>At least we know Adele is getting voted off first.</aside>
      <p>Roman realised Adele was getting upset and apologised.</p>
      <p>He told her: "Adele it’s not, the situation is funny. I wasn’t saying that at all, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to."</p>
      <p>Giving her a hug, Roman added: "I like the picture being there."</p>

      <p>Viewers were divided over the clash, with many predicting Adele will be the first celebrity to leave the jungle.</p>
      <p>One person said on Twitter: "Prejudice? At least we know Adele is getting voted off first."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Adele to be the first one out. Accusing Roman of being prejudice because he, like the rest of the nation, has no bloody idea why she has a framed photo of Jane Mcdonald?!"</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Can Adele be the first one voted out please. She's just as annoying as she was when she was on big brother."</p>
