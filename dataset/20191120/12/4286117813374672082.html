      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The FASTag programme is expected to remove traffic congestion at the toll plazas.</li>
        <li>The new intiative will increase transparency and efficiency in processing transactions.</li>
        <li>More than 28,500 point-of-sale locations have been established from where a FASTag can be purchased.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Ministry of Road Transport &amp; Highways is all set to implement the FASTag programme from December 1. Under the new plan, a vehicle owner will be charged double the normal fee at the toll plazas on the National Highways if his/her vehicle does not have a FASTag.</p>
      <p>All the lanes of the toll plazas will be declared as "FASTag lanes" from the beginning of the next month and the toll payments will be through a FASTag device affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>A single lane in each direction will be kept as a hybrid lane to accept not only FASTag-based toll payments but also through other modes on the condition that the vehicle owner will have to dish out twice the actual fee.</p>
      <p>A FASTag makes use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology for making toll payments without stopping the vehicle at the plazas. The toll amount is deducted directly from an account linked to the FASTag.</p>
      <p>The government's new initiative will not only remove traffic congestion at the toll plazas but also ensure that no one is overcharged. It will be applicable across the country and increase transparency and efficiency in processing transactions.</p>
      <h3>From where can you purchase a FASTag?</h3>
      <p>The Indian Highways Management Company Ltd and various banks have established more than 28,500 point-of-sale locations, including NH fee plazas, RTOs, common service centers, transport hubs, bank branches and selected petrol pumps, from where a FASTag can be purchased. A customer can also get it from the e-commerce platform Amazon.</p>
