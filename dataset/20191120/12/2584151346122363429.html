      <p>A prominent Maltese businessman was arrested Wednesday as part of the investigation into the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech was detained on board his luxury yacht, which was leaving a Maltese harbor at 5:30 a.m. local time.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Joseph Muscat later said Fenech was a "person of interest" in the October 2017 murder case, the<a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/17-black-owners-boat-intercepted-at-sea-by-afm.751177"> Times of Malta</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Fenech heads a property investment firm called the Tumas Group and was identified by Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) as being the owner of a Dubai-registered company called 17 Black — a company Caruana Galizia had written about. In February 2017, eight months before she was killed, she published a blog about 17 Black, alleging it was connected to Maltese politicians but without publishing any evidence.</p>
      <p>According to the FIAU, companies set up in Panama — information on which was disclosed as part of the Panama Papers investigation — and owned by then Energy Minister Konrad Mizzi and Keith Schembri, Muscat’s chief of staff, stood to receive payments of up to $2 million from 17 Black for unspecified services, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-daphne/malta-police-arrest-businessman-fenech-in-journalist-murder-case-sources-idUKKBN1XU0TO?il=0">Reuters</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The arrest came a day after <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/malta-pardon-offer-daphne-caruana-galizia-murder-case-joseph-muscat/">Muscat offered to pardon</a> a man who claims to know the mastermind behind the murder of Caruana Galizia. The man in question was arrested last Thursday during a raid that targeted an alleged money laundering ring.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/daphne-murder-middleman-seeks-pardon-to-name-mastermind.750880">Times of Malta</a>, the arrested man claims he can link the person suspected of commissioning the murder of Caruana Galizia to those who carried out the killing, as well as those who helped provide the explosive device used.</p>
      <p>Three men — brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and Vince Muscat — have been charged with the murder. They have all pleaded not guilty.</p>
