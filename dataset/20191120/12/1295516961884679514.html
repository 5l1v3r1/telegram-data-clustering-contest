      <p>The biggest addition to <i>Valhalla </i>is Jeb Stuart, who was handpicked by Hirst to serve as writer and showrunner for the new adventure series. Stuart will lead the show as it tells the story of some of the most famous Vikings who ever lived, including Leif Erikson, Freydis, Harald Harada and the Norman King William the Conqueror.</p>
      <p>"<i>Vikings: Valhalla</i> promises to be everything that fans love about the franchise; heart-pounding, unstoppable action rooted in rich characters and dramatic storytelling that shines the light on family, loyalty and power," Netflix VP or Original Series Channing Dungey said. "We are thrilled to bring the next iteration of the <i>Vikings </i>saga to life with Michael Hirst, Jeb Stuart, Morgan O'Sullivan and MGM Television."</p>
      <p>Although Netflix is crafting the show, the original <i>Vikings</i> is currently not available on the streaming service, though it can be streamed on Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. However, with the new series coming in, Netflix is expected to go after the SVOD rights for the original show so the two can air together.</p>
