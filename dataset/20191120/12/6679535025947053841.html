      <h2>Strategise your game plan, destroy bugs and rescue a scientist at the recently-opened XtraBlast, a free-roaming VR game zone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:02:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Priyadarshini-Paitandy-107/" target="_blank">Priyadarshini Paitandy</a></address>
      <p>There are gasps of horror followed by loud shrieks of terror at XtraBlast, a brand-new Virtual Reality gaming spot. Honestly, how else does one react when giant bugs pounce on them? Well apparently, you are supposed to develop a strategy with your teammate and shoot down these creatures as they descend from above — either charging at you from the front or crawling from behind.</p>
      <p>Some ghoul-esque creatures and a King Kong look-alike make their appearance in Alien Bug Shooting, the latest offering from Kaleidozone, a city-based company that specialises in VR games. Armed with assault rifles and futuristic backpacks, XtraBlast lets you fight them with your friends. When players don the VR headgear, they are transported into a whole new world — reminding a bit of New York. “The task is to save a scientist and demolish the alien bugs, all in a span of 30 minutes,” explains Muralidharan Erumbala, head of marketing and customer experience, Kaleidozone.</p>
      <p>The mission, should you choose to accept it, also involves a helicopter ride that offers an immersive experience, as the chopper glides past tall skyscrapers. The game ends with an open train ride that gives us the feeling of whizzing past dark tunnels and deserts. “It is an engaging game. As you start playing, you become part of the character and lose sense of time and become part of that time,” he smiles.</p>
      <p>About the overall design of the game, Raj B Kumar, who co-founded the company along with Murali Barathi, says, “The USP of this game, as opposed to say a PUBG, is that it brings friends and other people together, socially. Here, you can virtually see them in the game and also high-five each other in person during the course of the game.”</p>
      <p>“VR in the past had been solo games,” says Murali, adding, “But when you play as a team side by side, that sense of exhilaration is unparalleled. The whole game has been developed here in India.”</p>
