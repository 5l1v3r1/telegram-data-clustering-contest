      <p>John Abraham and Anil Kapoor led ensemble film <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/videos/pagalpanti-trailer-2-john-abraham-arshad-warsi-pulkit-samrats-hilarious-banter-with-gangster-anil-kapoor-is-unmissable/"><i>Pagalpanti</i> </a>has created a huge buzz around its release. While the trailers and songs have impressed the audience, John has revealed that the film takes a dig on the fugitives that have run away from the country looting banks. This has raised the eyebrows on whether the actor is pointing out at Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi and below is all you need to know.</p>
      <p>John and the cast has been busy promoting their film. Recently in an interview with Bollywood Hungama. John said, “Fugitives who have escaped our country after looting our banks and robbing thousands of middle-class people of their savings”!</p>

      <p>This rose the question whether they were talking about Mallya and Modi who flew away the same way. Answering the same, Anees Bazmee said, “Aise toh bahut log gaye hai na desh chod ke. So we have hinted in a way about them. But yeah, in logon ki (Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi) ki yaad toh zarur aayegi film dekh ke logon ko.”</p>
      <p>Further in the interview, John also called the film a weirdly patriotic one. Agreeing to the same director Bazmee expressed that it was not easy to introduce patriotism to this script. He said, “It was a very big challenge. Patriotism is a serious matter whereas my film’s genre is the exact opposite. It took me a lot of time. It’s one of the very important scenes in the film which will give goosebumps to every Indian. At the same time, it’ll also make you laugh! It is a one of its kind sequence. I don’t think any other film has had such a scene ever!”</p>
      <p>Though John has been associated with patriotic films, Anees cleared that the scene which he is been talking about was not written with John in mind. He said, “This scene was not written because of John Abraham’s presence in the film. He wanted the film to be completely funny. But when we thought of this patriotic scene, he and all the other actors loved it. They even told me ‘Anees Bhai, this is a completely new take. We have seen many films but this kind of logic and writing is unheard of.’ The idea is to praise the greatness of our country and if some people have escaped from India, then how to make them realize their fault.”</p>
      <p><i>Pagalpanti</i> starring John, Anil, Kriti Kharbanda, Ileana D’cruz, Saurabh Shukla and Arshad Warsi is all set to hit the big screens on November 22.</p>
