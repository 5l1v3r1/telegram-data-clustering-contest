      <p>VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican said on Thursday the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians had been put at risk after the United States backed Israel’s building of settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p>
      <p>“In the context of recent decisions that risk undermining further the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the already fragile regional stability, the Holy See reiterates its position of a two-state solution for two peoples, as the only way to reach a complete solution to this age-old conflict,” the Vatican said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The Holy See supports the right of the State of Israel to live in peace and security within the borders recognised by the international community and supports the same right that belongs to the Palestinian people, which must be recognised, respected and implemented,” it added.</p>
