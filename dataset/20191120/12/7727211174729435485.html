      <p>Liverpool remain on course to open their brand new £50million training facility before the start of next season.</p>
      <p>Work began <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-academy-melwood-klopp-kirkby-16683425">at the site of the club's Academy in Kirkby</a> back in 2018 and is operating within the original budget as builders continue to get the complex up to speed before the start of the 2020/21 campaign for Jurgen Klopp's Reds.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> are pleased with the progress that has been made in recent months at the ground, and with the external brickwork now complete, work has started on the inside as the club aim to have the site fully operational in time for pre season in July.</p>
      <p>The 9,200 square metre centre will be a facility that will house both first-team stars and the club's Academy talent with Klopp keen to gather all age groups at the same site.</p>

      <p>The ECHO understands both <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">Klopp</a> and first-team players have been consulted on key decisions as the club close in on completion of what they believe will be one of Europe's finest training complexes.</p>
      <p>It is also understood restrictions will be placed on entrances to the first-team area of the training ground as Klopp aims to make promotion to the senior part of the complex an incentive for Academy hopefuls.</p>
      <p>The move is designed to keep young players at the club motivated as the Reds continue to ground teenagers for a long-term career in football.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The state-of the art facilities comprise of two gyms, a full-size sports hall, pool, a hydrotherapy complex as well as specialist sports rehabilitation suites for injured players to use when aiming to regain fitness.</p>
      <p>Open-plan rooms have been designed for the gyms to allow players recovering from injury to see the training pitches in front of them as a source of motivation in their recovery process.</p>
      <p>The new first-team pitches are nearing completion, with artificial fibre stitching currently being installed ahead of the new grass being sown in the spring of 2020. Work on the new ground's maintenance area is also finalised.</p>

      <p>There are also dedicated TV studios, press conference facilities and offices as part of the £50m project that is being overseen by London architect firm KSS.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have had their current training facility, Melwood, in West Derby, since back in the 1950s and announced over two years ago that they had secured planning consent for its redevelopment as they prepared for the move to Kirkby.</p>
      <p>The departure from Melwood will be a historic one for the Reds with their training ground having been transformed into a top-class facility by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bill-shankly">Bill Shankly</a> back in the 1960s.</p>
      <p>While work has continued on site in Kirkby, another important part of the project has been completed and has seen the club give back to the local community.</p>

      <p>The club have now handed over the ownership, operation and maintenance of the newly redeveloped Eddie McArdle community pitches, located at the north end of the site.</p>
      <p>Andy Hughes, Chief Operating Officer for Liverpool FC, said: “We are really pleased with the progress that has been made and once the new training ground and its associated buildings are complete, the project will provide first class amenities for our players and staff.</p>

      <p>“We are also extremely proud to be investing in the Knowsley area to provide improved sports facilities for the community of Kirkby with the redevelopment of the Eddie McArdle Community Pitches.</p>
      <p>"Earlier this month we were pleased to officially hand over the facilities to Knowsley Council to own, operate and maintain moving forward.</p>
      <p>“Work at the training ground is on track for completion in summer 2020 when will see the first team and youth football operations come together on one site for the first time in the club’s history.”</p>
