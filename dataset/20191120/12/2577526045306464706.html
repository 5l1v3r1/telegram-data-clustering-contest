      <h1>Jedi: Fallen Order Pays Tribute To A Lucasarts Star Wars Veteran</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:08:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:08</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p><i>Fallen Order</i> is a game that, between its echoes and scanning, has a lot of incidental background fluff. Amongst all that, though, is a lovely tribute from a son (who worked on <i>Fallen Order</i>) to his father (who worked on a ton of classic <i>Star Wars</i> games back in the 90s).</p>

      <p>Respawn level designer Nicholas Cameron shared the message earlier today on Twitter, revealing that an echo on “an iconic snowy planet” that you travel to in the game is a tribute to his dad, Martin “Bucky” Cameron, who passed away last year.</p>
      <p>Martin was an artist at Lucasarts <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1407/">who worked on loads of the company’s classics</a>, from <i>Monkey Island</i> to <i>X-Wing</i> to <i>Tie Fighter</i> to <i>Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe</i>. His tribute calls him the Jedi Master Mar Ti “Bucky” Kam’Ron, and it’s a wonderful way of looping Nicholas’ work on <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-the-kotaku-review-1839940185">the best new <i>Star Wars</i> game in years</a> to the absolute golden era of Lucasarts tie-ins.</p>
