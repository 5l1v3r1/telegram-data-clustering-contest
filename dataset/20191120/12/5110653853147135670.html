      <p>Colin Kaepernick'sworkout <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-workout-nfl-teams-attending-news-time/1j0ptcovpmrtn1y2hopeq89fho">scheduled for Saturday afternoon</a> started falling apart before heeven touched a football.</p>
      <p>The free agent quarterback was originally set to work out in front of NFL team representatives at the Falcons' facility in Flowery Branch, Ga., beginning at 3 p.m. ET. That start time changed less than an hour before Kaepernickwas supposed to take the field, however, because of "transparency" issues with the NFL.Kaepernickmoved his workout back to 4 p.m. ET and shifted to a high school stadium in Riverdale, Ga.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Here is the full explanation <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195786538560507905">from Kaepernick's representatives</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Because of recent decisions made by the NFL, the workout for Colin Kaepernickwill be changing to an alternate location in Atlanta which will now start at 4 p.m. All representatives from clubs are invited to attend and will be provided the location. Further, all media will be invited to attend and upon request will be provided with the location. From the outset, Mr. Kaepernickrequested a legitimate process and from the outset the NFL league office has not provided one. Most recently, the NFL has demanded that as a precondition to the workout, Mr. Kaepernick sign an unusual liability waiver that addresses employment-related issues and rejected the standard liability waiverfrom physical injury proposed by Mr. Kaepernick'srepresentatives.<br/>Additionally, Mr. Kaepernick requested all media be allowed into the workout to observe and film it and for an independent film crew to be there to ensure transparency. The NFL denied this request. Based on the prior conduct by the NFL league office, Mr. Kaepernick simply asks for a transparent and open process which is why a new location has been selected for today. Mr. Kaepernick looks forward to seeing the representatives from the clubs today.</blockquote>

      <p>The NFL reportedly presented the Saturday workout to Kaepernick as a take-it-or-leave-it deal, fueling speculation that the 32-year-old would <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-nfl-saturday-workout-reports/198ymq72qaveq1se8s0p3m8t07">choose to pass</a> on the league's offer. Kaepernickultimately agreed to participate, though, saying he has <a href="https://twitter.com/Kaepernick7/status/1194415935890894848">"been in shape and ready for this for three years."</a></p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Kaepernick, the event sounded more like a PR stunt than a genuine opportunity given the hoops he had to jump through in order to ensure he got a fair shot at landing a job. Several team executives were <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1194763500700229633">confused by the NFL's decision to schedule the workout</a>, and multiple reports point to reasons ranging from NFL commissioner Roger Goodell<a href="https://www.espn.com/video/clip/_/id/28067625">feeling bad about Kaepernick's situation</a>to the league being tired of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28072048/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-why-happening-now-next">teams reaching out about his status</a>.</p>
      <p>Only adding to the circus, former NFL coach Hue Jackson, who was supposed to lead the drills at the workout, did not travel to the Riverdale venue.</p>

      <p>More than 24 teams were expected to attend Kaepernick's workout as of Friday night, <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195468852509003776">per ESPN's Adam Schefter</a>, but it is unclear how many traveled to the new location Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> The NFL<a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1195821238763036674/photo/1">issued a lengthy statement</a> regarding Kaepernick's workout, expressing disappointment he did not appear for the original 3 p.m. start time and revealing it found out about his decision at 2:30 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>"Today's session was designed to give Colin what he has consistently said he wants — an opportunity to show his football readiness and desire to return to the NFL," the statement said. "Twenty-five clubs were present for the workout, and all 32 clubs, their head coaches, general managers and other personnel executives would have received video footage of the interview and workout, shot by the Atlanta Falcons video crew."</p>
      <p>The leagueclaimed it made "considerable effort" to work with Kaepernick's representatives, including agreeing to a request from Nike to shoot an ad at the workout. The NFL disputed Kaepernick's description of the liability waiver process, saying that Kaepernick's reps sent the league a "completely rewritten and insufficient waiver."</p>
      <p>While the NFL did note that Kaepernick wanted to bring his own video production team and open the event to reporters, it did not specify if those requests were discussed or explicitly denied. The statement says it was always clear this would be a "private workout."</p>
      <p>Despite all of the chaos surrounding the workout, Kaepernick'sstatus hasn't changed.</p>
      <p>"[Kaepernick] remains an unrestricted free agent eligible to sign with any club," the statement said.</p>
