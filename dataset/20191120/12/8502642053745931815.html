      <h2>Soybeans Higher, Grains Lower Overnight; FERC Attempts to Address Propane Shortage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:16:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.agriculture.com/author/tony-dreibus" target="_blank">Tony Dreibus</a></address>
      <h3>1. Soybeans Higher, Grains Lower in Overnight Trading</h3>
      <p>Soybean futures were higher overnight while corn and wheat were lower in overnight trading as investors weigh the slow-moving harvest, which has underpinned prices, against pessimism about a trade deal between the U.S. and China.</p>
      <p>Only 76% of the U.S. corn crop was harvested as of Sunday, well behind the prior five-year average of 92%, according to the USDA. About 91% of soybeans were collected at the start of the week, trailing the normal 95% for this time of year.</p>
      <p>Cold, rainy weather is headed into parts of the Midwest this week, which likely will keep producers from getting the last of the crops out of their fields.</p>
      <p>Only 77% of Iowa corn was in the bin to start the week versus the prior five-year average of 93%. In Illinois, 80% was collected versus the normal 97%, the USDA said.</p>
      <p>The seemingly never-ending trade war between the U.S. and China continues to drag on with no end in sight.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump said in a speech yesterday that if China doesn’t agree to a deal, he’ll “just raise the tariffs even higher.” That may make negotiations between the countries – the world’s two largest economies – even more complicated.</p>
      <p>China hasn’t yet responded to Trump’s threat. The sides reportedly agreed to a “partial” deal last month but nothing definitive has been announced.</p>
      <p>Soybean futures for January delivery rose 3¢ to $9.14 ½ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soymeal was unchanged at $302 a short ton while soybean oil added 0.39¢ to 31.35¢ a pound.</p>
      <p>Corn futures for December delivery fell 1 3/4¢ to $3.68 ¼ a bushel.</p>
      <p>Wheat for September delivery lost 2 1/2¢ to $5.12 ¾ a bushel, while Kansas City futures dropped 2 3/4¢ to $4.29 a bushel.</p>

      <h3>2. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Initiations ADR to Address Propane Shortage</h3>
      <p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said Tuesday it would initiate a so-called alternative dispute resolution process to address the propane shortage that’s making it difficult for producers to dry down their crops after a wet growing season.</p>
      <p>Several states have declared emergencies, which allow them to waive laws on hours of service and load restrictions on vehicles carrying propane.</p>
      <p>The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration issued a regional waiver that covers most Corn Belt states including Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska in a bid to ease the propane shortage.</p>
      <p>FERC said in its statement the alternative dispute resolution process will bring together pipeline companies, shippers and their representatives to find ways to alleviate constraints on propane shipping in the Midwest.</p>
      <p>“This action is the result of conversations with and letters from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and several members of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate expressing their concerns regarding reports of propane distribution and supply difficulties in the Midwest,” FERC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The agency also said it will allow Enterprise TE Product Pipeline Co. to provide emergency propane transportation in the Midwest for 30 days.</p>
      <p>FERC Chairman Neil Chatterjee said in the statement that the organization has been working with both federal and state lawmakers along with producers and others on the issue.</p>
      <p>“By bringing the pipelines and shippers to the table, we are building on these efforts and establishing a dialogue focused on exploring concrete solutions,” he said.</p>

      <h3>3. Precipitation Expected in Parts of Iowa, Missouri; Rain Turns to Snow in Central Nebraska</h3>
      <p>Widespread rain is expected tonight in parts of southeastern Iowa and northeastern Missouri, which will likely keep producers from getting the last of their crops out of the ground, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
      <p>There’s a possibility that the rainfall will continue in southeastern Iowa, west-central Illinois and northeastern Missouri into tomorrow morning, the NWS said in a statement early this morning.</p>
      <p>Further west, a “strong” cold front likely will bring precipitation and strong winds to central Nebraska starting tonight.</p>
      <p>“Rain will change to snow tonight as the colder air moves in,” the NWS said. “Generally any snow accumulation will be light, but a band of heavier snow of 2 inches or more could materialize across portions of southwest into north central Nebraska.”</p>
      <p>Winds with gusts of up to 35 miles an hour also can be expected.</p>
