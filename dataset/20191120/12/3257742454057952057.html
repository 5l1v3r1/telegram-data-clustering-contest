      <p>Apple is partnering with in-store music firm PlayNetwork to provide a business licence for the use of Apple Music. Stores such as Levi's and London's Harrods, have been trialling a service that sees Apple creating store-specific playlists.</p>

      <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple">Apple</a>has a new service called <a href="https://www.applemusicforbusiness.apple/">Apple Music for Business</a>, which sees the company working with <a href="https://www.playnetwork.com/">PlayNetwork</a> to provide and manage playlists tailored to suit retail firms. PlayNetwork already provides various music services for stores, restaurants and hotels, and will manage the licensing and Apple creates the playlists.<br/><br/>Apple Music for Business has been trialled for six months and according to previous <i>AppleInsider</i> reports, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/12/05/apple-music-for-business-streaming-service-might-be-in-the-works">has been planned</a> since at least June 2018.<br/><br/>During the trial, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-gets-into-the-muzak-business-11574247603">according</a> to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, alongside test installations at Harrods and Levi's, the company has signed up 25 businesses.<br/><br/>"We were captivated by their proposition that we could have our brand reflected in our own curated playlist," said Guy Cheston, director of partnerships at Harrods.<br/><br/>Apple Music for Business will compete with existing services such as Soundtrack Your Brand, which counts <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Spotify">Spotify</a> among its key investors. Typically, such services charge businesses between $25 and $35 per month, per location. Neither Apple nor PlayNetwork will disclose how much they are charging, but PlayNetwork described it as being priced competitively.<br/><br/>While businesses benefit from better-tailored music in their stores, musicians and artists should also see a fairer payment. The <i>WSJ</i> reports that in the last year, businesses using consumer music streaming such as the regular <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/Apple+Music">Apple Music</a>, meant the industry lost $2.65 billion.<br/><br/>Apple gains from more than a new source of subscription revenue, too. In the Harrods trial, the store displayed screens prompting customers to listen to the Harrods Playlist on Apple Music. It's really a promotion for listening to the music as you shop, there is no publicly-available Harrods Playlist on Apple Music itself.</p>

      <p>However, the <i>WSJ</i> says it is intended to lead to customers subscribing to Apple Music themselves, and Apple is reportedly to pay a referral fee to the stores when that happens.<br/><br/>Apple Music recently introduced <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/13/apple-music-replay-aggregates-users-top-played-songs-of-the-year">new Replay playlists</a> for consumers that let you listen to your favorite music from each year since you subscribed to the service.</p>
