      <h3>China wants a deal but is prepared for a prolonged trade war – Global Times</h3>
      <p> Hu Xijin, the <b>Editor-in-chief of Chinese and English editions of the Global Times</b>, tweeted out last minutes: “Few Chinese believe that China and the US can reach a deal soon. Given the current poor China policy of the US, people tend to believe the significance of a trade deal, if reached, will be limited. China wants a deal but is prepared for the worst-case scenario, a prolonged trade war.” <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/china-wants-a-deal-but-prepared-for-prolonged-trade-war-global-times-201911200746">Read more…</a></p>

      <p>The US’ Hong Kong bill, however, aggravated the concerns over the likely <b>US-China trade deal prospects and triggered a fresh spell of risk-aversion </b>across the financial markets, with the European stocks nearly 0.80%-1% and Treasury yields losing 5bps or about 3% so far. In times of market unrest and panic, markets sell-off the risk asset such as oil to seek safety in the US dollar, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> etc. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/wti-hits-fresh-three-week-lows-below-55-on-us-china-risks-eia-eyed-201911201011">Read more...</a></p>
