      <p>Young Shakespeares and Wordsworths have been honing their poetry prowess.</p>
      <p>Professional poet Rachel Rooney ran a workshop with pupils at Halberton and Uplowman Primary School on Friday, November 8 as well as heading to see a performance at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter thanks to The Children’s Bookshow charity.</p>
      <p>Pupils also received free poetry books and the opportunity to take part in the workshop. The children learnt about how poems are written, structured and presented.</p>
      <p>Head of teaching and learning at Uplowman, Rebecca Hart, said: “It has been fantastic to see the children working together and learning about writing poetry.</p>
      <p>“They have had a chance to work alongside a professional poet and understand more about playing with language and creating entertaining poems. They have worked well and shared some great ideas.”</p>
      <p>Christine Campion from Halberton added: “I have been impressed with the poetry our children have created. I think they have been inspired, and for many, it will have been their first time seeing a performance poet. We will be creating a book with the poetry they have produced, and we look forward to sharing them with parents and pupils.”</p>
      <p>Rachel Rooney said: “I had a fabulous time at Halberton Primary. They’ve built a lovely library for the pupils there, and the staff have a love of books and reading.</p>
      <p>“I always enjoy visiting schools and engaging pupils with poetry. I was honoured to read poems that their pupils were inspired to write after my visit. They are brilliant - and I better watch out as I clearly have some competition.”</p>
