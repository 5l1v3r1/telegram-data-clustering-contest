      <p>The Indian rupee settled 10 paise lower at 71.81 against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking weak Asian currencies and strengthening of the greenback overseas.</p>
      <p>However, the decline in the domestic unit was capped by a rally in domestic stocks, forex traders said.</p>
      <p>At the interbank foreign exchange market, the domestic currency opened weak at 71.80, then went on to hit a low of 71.91 against the US dollar during the day.</p>
      <p>It, however, clawed back some of its lost ground to finally finish at 71.81, showing a fall of 10 paise over its previous close.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the local unit had settled at 71.71 against the greenback.</p>
