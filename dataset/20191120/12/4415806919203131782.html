      <p>Menzel, 48, is best known for her role as Elsa in Disney’s Frozen films – the second of which will be in UK cinemas from Friday November 22 – and for her Broadway career in hit musicals including Rent and Wicked.</p>
      <p>The US star follows in the footsteps of fellow big names such as Sir Elton John, Dolly Parton, David Hasselhoff, Mark Ronson and Tom Hardy in signing up for the star-studded TV slot.</p>
      <p>Menzel’s role in settling down young viewers before bedtime comes after it was announced that US jazz singer Gregory Porter will become the first celebrity to sing a CBeebies Bedtime Story rather than read it.</p>
      <p>Porter will sing Moon River, the classic ballad from the 1961 film Breakfast At Tiffany’s, on Friday November 22.</p>
      <p>Menzel’s slot will air on the pre-school channel on Sunday November 24. CBeebies Bedtime Stories airs daily at 6.50pm.</p>
