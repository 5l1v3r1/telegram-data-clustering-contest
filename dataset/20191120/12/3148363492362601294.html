      <p>A regional court in Pamplona also fined them 5,670 euros ($6,280) on Wednesday for the seven videos and two photographs they made of the rape.</p>
      <p>The five, who had a WhatsApp group named “La Manada,” or “The Animal Pack,” were imprisoned for 15 years by the Supreme Court in July for raping an 18-year-old woman during Pamplona’s San Fermin festival in 2016.</p>
      <p>The case earned renown because lower courts convicted them of lesser crimes.</p>
      <p>Four of the five are also on trial for allegedly sexually abusing another woman in 2016.</p>
