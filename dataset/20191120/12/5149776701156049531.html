      <p>Whether you are a secret soprano in the shower or habouring a more unusual talent, now is your time to shine and show off as the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/britains-got-talent">Britain's Got Talent</a> auditions return to Nottingham.</p>
      <p>The popular prime time talent show is hitting the road once again on its search to find talented acts for a brand new series of the BAFTA award-winning series.</p>
      <p>This year, the BGT team is coming the Crowne Plaza, in Wollaton Street, on Sunday, December 15 with auditions taking place between 10am and 4pm.</p>
      <p>Successful acts will then be in with a chance of securing a place at one of the judges’ auditions in 2020.</p>
      <p>The show is open to any performer of any age, with any talent including magicians, comedians, drag acts, singers, acrobats and animal stars.</p>
      <p>Executive producer Charlie Irwin says: “Britain’s Got Talent 2019 was another fantastic series showcasing the best talent and variety from all over the UK.</p>

      <p>“Colin Thackery triumphed, becoming the oldest ever winner of BGT proving the point - whatever age you are, or what talent you have – anything is possible.</p>
      <p>"Whether you’re an acrobat, comedian, a dancer or even a puppet - we can’t wait to see what talent the public will bring in 2020.</p>
      <p>"Anyone can apply - there is no age limit and we are looking for all kinds of talents. So, if you feel you have something special to show us, no matter what it is, then make sure you apply, you never know where it might take you.”</p>
      <p>Series 13 winner Colin Thackery adds: “Since winning Britain’s Got Talent my life has been turned upside down! I have signed a record deal, recorded an album and am in the process of writing a book.</p>
      <p>"I have met so many wonderful people since auditioning, received so many kind messages and have lost count how many times people have taken my photograph! Signing up to BGT was one of, if not, the best decision I ever made.”</p>
      <p>Clifton's 18-year-old classical singer, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/faith-tucker-misses-out-britains-2917414">Faith Tucker</a>, reached the semi-finals of this year's competition and has since enjoyed numerous TV and stage appearances.</p>
