      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:04:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>It's that time of year when cash is tight, what with all that Christmas present buying and festive nights out, so anything where you can save a few quid is not to be sniffed at.</p>
      <p>A West Bridgford restaurant and takeaway's six-month anniversary, with the promise of cut-price food, is perfect timing.</p>
      <p>Customers can bag themselves a half-price lunch, tea or post-drinks' bargain.</p>
      <p>For one day only, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/west-bridgfords-posh-new-kebab-2918077">Eva's Grill</a> in Radcliffe Road will be serving pitta gyros for just £2.50 and shish wraps for £3.25.</p>
      <p>Owner Julian Koraqe said: "We want to celebrate being open six months and say thank you to all our customers."</p>

      <p>The deal will be available from 11.30am to 11.30pm, on Monday, December 2.</p>
      <p>Since opening, the business has increased its menu. "We are strong in the market with rotisserie products like a whole lamb, offal, chicken and pork.</p>
      <p>"We also offer <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/food-drink-nottinghams-winter-wonderland-3549680">Greek</a> home-made feta cheese pies, spinach pies, ham pies, sausage, cakes and coffee," said Julian.</p>
