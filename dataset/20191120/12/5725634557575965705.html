      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HP should do due diligence on EPAM, an $11 billion market cap company focused on IT Services.</li>
        <li>EPAM occupies a unique niche in the IT Services space, providing unmatched expertise and below-market pricing.</li>
        <li>While valuation may be rich, over time EPAM should prove as a profitable investment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Background / Company Description:</b>
      </p>
      <p>We have long maintained that EPAM Systems (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPAM">EPAM</a>) is one of the best acquisition targets in the IT Services space today. With HP's Board over the weekend unanimously rejecting XRX's unsolicited proposal to acquire it, the case for acquisition remains, in our view, albeit it is not one of Xerox. Given the generous cash flows of the HP and the company's well-known intent to diversify its holdings, EPAM may just do the trick.</p>
      <p>As we analyze HP's decision to reject Xerox's offer, we see three core possible reasons: 1) Xerox is too closely aligned with HP's core business, which may lead to some cannibalization effects; 2) There is disagreement on price (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/11/07/xerox-offers-22-a-share-in-takeover-bid-for-hp-sources-tell-cnbc.html">See article</a>); and last but not least: 3) HP didn't initiate the acquisition talks, which in itself strengthens their bargaining position.</p>
      <p>We are not going to comment on the future of the HP-Xerox deal, though we do put the probability at less than 30%. Rather, we would like to reiterate our position that EPAM is an excellent acquisition target that would meaningfully diversify HP's platform, while adding a company with a 20%+ Y/Y annual revenue growth and 15% Y/Y annual EPS growth.</p>
      <p>Recall that EPAM is a company that offers software engineering and product development solutions in the IT services space, being one of the leaders in the industry. The company occupies a niche space in consulting and outsourcing fields, focusing on lifecycle software testing, product deployment and end-user customization, performance tuning, managed services, and cross-platform migration, among other tasks. EPAM’s main competitors are Accenture, IBM, Cognizant, and Infosys, though its core differentiating factor is the labor sourcing platform, since the vast majority of the company’s employees come from Eastern Europe, largely Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. EPAM serves technology companies in financial service, travel and consumer, software and hi-tech, media and entertainment, as well as healthcare. It derives about 50% of revenue from the United States, 40% from Western Europe, and approximately 10% from CIS and the emerging markets.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is EPAM Attractive?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our channel checks indicate that EPAM should expect an expansion of their contractual scope from a number of core clients, such as Google, Expedia, Barclays, and possibly UBS. (Note that these clients are among the company's top ten, making up at least 23-27% of total revenue). It is our understanding that in 2020 these accounts would require greater expertise in cloud and analytics domains, as well as in business process outsourcing.</p>
      <p>Since EPAM's consulting arm was fairly under-developed in Western and Central Europe until 2017, we believe that EPAM will now aggressively take advantage of these newly-minted capabilities. We expect some of EPAM's clients in the financial services sector, such as UBS, to take advantage of the company's competitive pricing and switch from some of more seasoned providers, such as Accenture or Capgemini, to EPAM’s platform.</p>
      <p>Further, EPAM offers sophisticated consulting expertise from its employee professionals in Eastern Europe, more than 80% of whom have post-Masters degree educational credentials. Overall, there is aggressive new account growth in Eastern Europe. It is our understanding that EPAM is adding a number of new accounts in the Eastern Europe throughout 2019, a traction that should extend into next year. Eastern Europe has smaller margins than the rest of the continent, but we expect that to change in 2020-21.</p>
      <p>This brings us to pricing. On average (and this, of course, varies from client to client), EPAM gives approximately 16-23% discount to the pricing offered by its larger cap competitors. Lean operations and outsourced labor costs help explain their more favorable pricing capabilities. Further, the company offers about 5-7% discount to the pricing provided by IT services players of their own size, such as Luxoft and Globant.</p>
      <p>While in the past the company has been less transparent about disclosing its pricing structure, in recent months we see the Street becoming more aggressive in evaluating price-driven demand at EPAM, which leads us to believe that the company may now benefit from a wider recognition of fresh demand opportunities, leading in turn to a more aggressive valuation.</p>
      <p>Overall, with a wide range of verticals ranging from financial services and tech to consumer and media, we believe that the IT Services platform of EPAM would offer a great and diversifying revenue base to HP.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Valuation: Rich, But Fair:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Per our industry-wide analysis and EPAM’s strong fundamentals, as well as in light of the recent favorable guidance, we believe that EPAM shares merit ~22x P/E multiple on 2020 earnings. We note that this multiple comes at an ~1.5-2x discount relative to other players in the IT Services space. When we apply it to our 2020 non-GAAP EPS estimate of $9.81, we reach a target price of $216.</p>
      <p>Overall, this is a fairly expensive multiple, though not in the present market, albeit we see a number of IT Services companies getting cautious, with about 35% of them expecting a recession in the next 6-12 months. We believe that EPAM would become a viable target for acquisition, once its multiple becomes cheaper. This could be for a number of different reasons below (while the market multiple stays intact).</p>
      <p>
        <b>EPAM's Risks:</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Geopolitical Factors:</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Given that Epam Systems sources labor force from the relatively volatile region of Eastern Europe, such as Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, we believe that political turmoil or destabilization could be harmful to the company’s operations. We saw how in 2014 EPAM shares plummeted 10-15% on the news of political upheaval in Ukraine. Further, continued sanctions levied on Russia could have a negative top-line impact on EPAM, albeit the company derives only 3-4% of total revenue from Russia.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Pricing Wars:</b>
      </p>
      <p>While EPAM strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see Luxoft, EPAM’s main competitor, potentially (and selectively) lowering prices as well. In turn, this could lead to a pricing war and result in lower revenues for both parties.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Concentrated Revenue:</b>
      </p>
      <p>With top 10 clients constituting about 45% of total revenue, we see any defection of a client or a reduction in the scope of the project as an inherent threat.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. OPEX Pressures</b>
      </p>
      <p>The company faces incremental operating pressures, as it opens new markets not only to attract new clients but also to find new sources of labor. We believe that mismanagement of new opex investments may lead to higher-than-expected costs and thus threaten the company’s valuation.</p>
