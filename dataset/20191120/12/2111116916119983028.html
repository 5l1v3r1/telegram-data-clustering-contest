      <p>Debian 10 has been released, with the latest incarnation of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-linux-distros">Linux distro</a> being codenamed ‘Buster’ and bringing a number of improvements, not to mention a host of updated packages.</p>
      <p>The developers note that Buster took just over two years to craft and hone to a stable version, and will be supported for the next five years going forward.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The OS ships with a variety of desktop environments, running with Gnome (3.30) with Wayland display server by default (but it also incorporates Cinnamon 3.8, KDE Plasma 5.14, Mate 1.20, Xfce 4.12 and more).</p>
      <p>Secure Boot is supported in Debian 10 and should work out of the box, and the devs also observe: “Thanks to the Reproducible Builds project, over 91% of the source packages included in Debian 10 will build bit-for-bit identical binary packages. This is an important verification feature which protects users against malicious attempts to tamper with compilers and build networks.”</p>
      <h4>Plentiful packages</h4>
      <p>As mentioned, a ton of software packages have been updated for Buster – almost two-thirds of the packages delivered with the previous release of Debian 9 (known as ‘Stretch’).</p>
      <p>That includes Chromium 73.0, Firefox 60.7, GIMP 2.10.8, LibreOffice 6.1, Thunderbird 60.7.2, Perl 5.28, PHP 7.3, Python 3 3.7.2, Ruby 2.5.1 and much more (there are over 59,000 software packages in total).</p>
      <p>Check here for full release notes, and you can grab Debian 10 live images here (which allow you to try the distro without installing it on your hard disk – although you can fully install the OS from the live image by following the instructions provided).</p>
