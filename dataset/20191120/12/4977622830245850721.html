      <h1>Pakistani Man Jailed For Plotting Murder Of Dutch MP Who Announced Competition To Draw Cartoon Of Prophet Mohammed</h1>

      <p>A Dutch court sentenced a Pakistani man to 10 years imprisonment on Monday (18 November) for plotting the assassination of Dutch MP Geert Wilders.</p>
      <p>The court found the man, identified as 27-year-old Junaid I, guilty of plotting the murder of Wilders, who announced a Prophet Mohammed cartoon competition.</p>
      <p>Junaid, who had travelled from France to Holland, was arrested in August 2018 at a train station in The Hague after he posted a film on Facebook, wherein he claimed he wanted to "send Wilders to hell" and urged others to help.</p>
      <p>Judges at The Hague's district court found the man guilty of "planning a murder with a terrorist motive" and incitement to commit a terror attack.</p>
      <p>However, during the trial Junaid called himself a "peace-loving" man, who had only travelled to Holland to protest against Wilders' cartoon competition.</p>
