        <b>The 30th edition of Fehispor, Fair of Spain and Portugal, begins on Thursday in the Spanish city of Badajoz, with 130 exhibitors from both countries</b>
      </p>
      <p>Considered one of the most important trade and business fairs in the Iberian Peninsula, Fehispor, which takes place until Sunday at the Instituci√≥n Ferial de Badajoz (IFEBA), in Extremadura, usually receives about 30,000 visitors, about 25% of who are Portuguese.</p>
      <p>Organised by IFEBA and the Badajoz local authority, Fehispor aims to be "the meeting point for the economy and companies of the two countries, as well as for society and Luso-Spanish culture".</p>
      <p>This year's edition of the multisectoral exhibition will feature 130 exhibiting companies, half of them Portuguese, from different sectors.</p>
      <p>According to the organisers, a novelty in this year's event is the "Turiberia" space, an Iberian tourism exhibition, which has Qatar as its guest country.</p>
      <p>Visitors will be able to enjoy the models of the stadiums that will host the games of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p>
      <p>Portugal is one of the main foreign investors in the Spanish region of Extremadura, considered a gateway to the Spanish market, and there are several examples of companies that started their expansion to Spain at Fehispor, especially in banking, industry, logistics, energy, agriculture and coffee.</p>
      <p>Fehispor is a fair that brings together Spanish and Portuguese entrepreneurs and allows the creation of new business opportunities.</p>
      <p>In addition to its professional activities, the fair has a pavilion dedicated to gastronomy, a handicraft space, musical entertainment and exhibitions, among other attractions.</p>
