      <p><i>By</i> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/sa-admin-jonathan-liss#regular_articles"><i>Jonathan Liss</i></a></p>
      <p>When <a href="http://www.mypacificpark.com/">Pacific Park Financial</a> Founder and President <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/author/gary-gordon#regular_articles">Gary Gordon</a> last appeared on Let's Talk ETFs in July, in an episode titled <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4276635-building-etf-portfolio-end-cycle">Building An ETF Portfolio For The End Of The Cycle</a>, he laid out his view that we would likely be in a recession in the U.S. by the end of 2020 - and that it would probably be a market sell-off that would get us there. Despite a seeming improvement <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307704-u-s-inventories-producer-inflation-jobless-claims-fed-change-likely">in some key measures of economic health</a> in recent months such as consumer spending - coupled with a lack of bad news on the employment and earnings fronts - Gary isn't buying the resounding optimism that's been heard of late from the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2CLWPMyoqM">Fed Vice-Chair Richard Clarida</a>.</p>
      <p>Quite the opposite. The steepening of the interest rate curve brought on by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-balancesheet/qe-on-the-qt-fed-says-no-economists-say-maybe-so-idUSKBN1WQ2SF">reintroduction of QE</a> (or something that looks and smells just like it) is "exactly what you'd expect from credit markets following an inverted yield curve." As Gary explains, the mechanics we're seeing in credit markets are the same as in every other economic expansion cycle that was about to run its course: the yield curve inverts and markets panic leading the Fed to try and cut rates and introduce greater liquidity into the system in an attempt to widen credit spreads. Spreads generally comply at first but slowing growth and eroding consumer confidence forces the Fed to continue cutting rates until they get down to the zero rate bound - and we're in a full-blown recession. At which point things stabilize and we start to see growth and much better expected returns again.</p>
      <blockquote>"I'm not a believer in the notion that the Fed has repealed the business cycle. As I wrote earlier, there comes a time when the Fed won't be able to force credit on those who choose to refuse it," <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4298735-election-total-returns-treasury-bonds-will-trump-stocks">explains Gary</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>The latest episode of Let's Talk ETFs can be split into 2 broad sections. In part 1, Gary brings support for his views on the current economic outlook and how that's likely to affect asset prices. In part 2, we go through all of the key asset classes - stocks, bonds, REITs, commodities and cash - with specific ETFs Gary is using in his practice to keep his clients' portfolios safe without taking too much risk off the table and missing out on whatever run-up continues to take place until the party ends.</p>
      <p>And of course, no conversation with Gary would be complete without getting his thoughts on a topic of great importance to both of us: the current state of NY Giants football (it ain't pretty, that's for sure).</p>
