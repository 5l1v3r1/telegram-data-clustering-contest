      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:20:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/joseph-green/" target="_blank">Joseph Green</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> A three-month subscription to <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/be4w">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> is on sale for £1, saving you 97% on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>You're likely to come across loads of deals in the coming weeks, and everyone will be telling you that it's the best deal out there, or that this discount is unprecedented and never to be seen again.</p>
      <p>Now we're not going to say that the current Xbox Game Pass Ultimate deal will never resurface, or that it has never been seen before, but we will say that it's the best available right now and it's simply incredible.</p>
      <p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes access to the Xbox Game Pass library of games, with Xbox Live Gold for online gamers. It is normally priced at £32.99 for a three-month subscription, but can now be picked up for just £1. That is a <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/be4w">97% reduction</a> in list price, which is staggering.</p>
      <p>On top of this, <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/be4w">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> members can also get one month of EA Access, three months of Discord Nitro, and six months of Spotify Premium for free. You'll need to be a new member to gain access to these subscriptions, but that's the only thing standing in your way.</p>
      <p>Microsoft's Black Friday sale hasn't officially launched yet, but you shouldn't delay when it comes to this deal.</p>
