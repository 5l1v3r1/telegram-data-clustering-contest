      <h1>200 years of the oldest running railway line in England is marked with a new exhibition</h1>
      <h2>The Mansfield &amp; Pinxton Railway track began with horse-drawn carriages</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:43:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">Gurjeet Nanrah</a></address>
      <p>A railway line that is the oldest still running in England is being commemorated with a new library exhibition.</p>
      <p>200 years ago, the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/mansfield">Mansfield</a> &amp; Pinxton Railway track was completed, allowing carriages to be drawn by horses along its route.</p>
      <p>Today, as part of the Robin Hood Line, it delivers around 50 daily train services between Nottingham and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/worksop">Worksop</a>, and according to the Office of Rail and Road, saw 409,294 passengers enter and exit its busiest station - Mansfield Town - in 2017-2018.</p>
      <p>It was the first double track line - a railway with two tracks running in opposite directions - to be approved by Parliament, and had a "massive influence" on the introduction of these elsewhere.</p>

      <p>At a time when canals were being extended to increase transport links, Mansfield had struggled to make this change due to its terrain and so it was decided to build a railway line instead linking the town to Pinxton.</p>
      <p>The railway helped Mansfield move forward at a time when transport was increasingly steam-powered.</p>
      <p>Denis Hill, a professional historian with the Kirkby and District Archaeological Group, said: "It represents the entire development of railways, right from how people thought of how they could be smoother, right to diesel transport.</p>
      <p>"It's gone through the entire spectrum of all rail transport and is not really thought about much, but it's had a massive influence.</p>
      <p>"The risk of the town [Mansfield] being left behind was caused by how the canals were being used for transport everywhere else.</p>
      <p>"Businessmen got together and decided the only way to move forward was to build the railway between Mansfield and Pinxton and quite frankly, it saved Mansfield so coal could still come here from Erewash - which was especially needed when the steam trains came a bit later."</p>

      <p>The railway opened in 1819 and used horse-drawn carriages until 1849 when Mansfield saw its first steam powered locomotive under Midlands Railway.</p>
      <p>The original line has since been extended to run services further into north Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>Archaeological digs in areas along the railway line have uncovered the original track beds from 200 years ago. Like today, they were put in a clay bed to create suction and prevent them moving.</p>
      <p>While the line is operated by East Midlands Railway, the track itself is owned by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/network-rail">Network Rail</a>.</p>
      <p>Denis, who is 65 and from Mansfield, added: "After Mansfield was established, the pace that double rail tracks were being established in other places was massive."</p>

      <p>Plans have been put together and funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund for an exhibition at Nottingham Central Library, on Angel Row, to show the evolution of the railway and celebrate its 200-year history.</p>
      <p>Items on display include a model of the Kings Mill viaduct that is situated along the Mansfield &amp; Pinxton line and an original rail from the track laid in 1819.</p>
      <p>Graham Upchurch, the maker of the model and a former miner from Ashfield, said: "It took a good while to put together. I had to go to the viaduct and measure it all up and take loads of pictures.</p>
      <p>"I've lived in the area my whole life and the viaduct was my playground. I wanted to do this because very little has been written about the railway line and hopefully this model can build some interest in it by making people outside of Mansfield and Ashfield more aware of it."</p>
