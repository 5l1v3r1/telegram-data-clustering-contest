      <p>Well, we’ve all dreaded the health problems running in our families, and especially the ones that we’re sure will creep up on us at some point in life, isn’t it? One of the most prevalent and pernicious diseases is Diabetes, a major health concern that became the seventh leading cause of death in 2016 (as per WHO). Diabetes has become so endemic that we’ve almost turned complacent towards keeping a lifestyle check, let alone finding the underlying causes of this problem. While the insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes requires daily administration of insulin, type 2 diabetes results from the body’s ineffective use of insulin and is largely the result of inactive lifestyle and obesity. It is widely believed that diabetes is primarily caused genetically but it is also important to learn what else might trigger the disease.</p>
      <p>We can never stop hogging over our favourite drinks and dishes at a party, not even on a strict diet. Focusing on healthy eating habits will not only keep you fit and active, but will majorly control your blood sugar levels. Wanna know the good news? With healthy eating tips, you can still enjoy your food without feeling hungry or deprived. This means that you no longer have to lead a deprived life to control diabetes, this can all be done easily and that too without a lifetime of bland food. Here are some healthy eating tips for you to keep in mind…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Leaving the fatty oil for good? Here’s what can help</b>
      </p>
      <p>A low-fat diet prevents various diseases such as chronic heart problems and diabetes. While an excessive fat diet may increase the risk of certain diseases, several studies suggest that it is the type of fat that counts. So instead of completely getting rid of oil, why don’t we go for a healthy toss? Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated oleic acid which is believed to have many beneficial effects and is a healthy choice for cooking. It benefits your heart health in miraculous ways by protecting bad LDL cholesterol particles from oxidation and improves the function of blood vessels. And if you’re constantly worried about gaining weight, consuming olive oil does not appear to increase the likelihood of weight gain and moderate intake may even aid weight loss and prevent strokes.</p>
      <p>Healthier fats are present in foods like unsalted nuts, seeds, avocados, oily fish, olive oil, rapeseed oil and sunflower oil. Saturated fats that are found in dairy products like ghee, butter or red meat can increase the amount of cholesterol in your blood, making you susceptible to heart problems. While many dieticians suggest that it’s a good idea to cut down on using oils, it is also recommended that you go for healthier fats instead and replace the fatty cooking oils with <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Figaro-Aceite-Oliva-Tin-500ml/dp/B00KJB3ZAC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2PBU2OLH3O5GI&amp;keywords=figaro+olive+oil+500ml&amp;qid=1573640988&amp;sprefix=figaro+%2Caps%2C261&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyM1Y3OTgyQTc2UlRQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjQ2MDg4M08wQjJUR0NWUDc4QyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTE3NDMxMktTR01BWDVHT1U3SCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">Olive Oil</a>. Suitable for all types of cooking, <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Figaro-Aceite-Oliva-Tin-500ml/dp/B00KJB3ZAC/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2PBU2OLH3O5GI&amp;keywords=figaro+olive+oil+500ml&amp;qid=1573640988&amp;sprefix=figaro+%2Caps%2C261&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyM1Y3OTgyQTc2UlRQJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjQ2MDg4M08wQjJUR0NWUDc4QyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNTE3NDMxMktTR01BWDVHT1U3SCZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=">Figaro Olive Oil</a> is an excellent all-purpose edible oil that has multiple health benefits. It is rich in vitamins, full of anti-oxidants, maintains cardio-circulatory system and regulates cholesterol level.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cut down on added sugar</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cutting down on sugary items can be really hard, especially when you have a sweet tooth.<br/>This might make you wonder if you should avoid fruits too but the answer is NO. Whole fruits are good for everyone and even if you have diabetes, natural sugar is harmless unlike the added sugar in chocolates, biscuits and cakes. On the other hand, canned fruit juices have added sugar and it is best suggested that you go for whole fruits instead. Also, swapping sugary drinks with drinks without sugar can be a good start and avoiding artificial or zero-calorie sweeteners is also proven beneficial for diabetes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Eat less salt</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you have diabetes, the chances of high blood pressure also increases which means you will have to keep a regular check on your salt intake as well. High blood pressure also increases risk of heart diseases and stroke. So try swapping salt for different types of herbs and spices. Trust me, a pinch of different flavors in your dishes will do all the justice to a little less salt present.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Healthier Carbohydrates</b>
      </p>
      <p>Abstaining all carbs can get pretty difficult but since it also affects your blood glucose levels, keeping a check on your portion diet can save the struggle. So, let’s toss the regular carbs with some healthy sources of carbohydrates ensuring that you don’t miss out on essential nutrients. Also its important to replace the food items low in fibre like white bread, white rice with fibre-rich food. Here’s your guide for the right carbs</p>
      <p>
        <i>– Focusing on whole grain carbs can keep your blood sugar levels more even which means you don’t have to cut down on carbs completely. </i>
        <i><br/>– Whole grains like brown rice, buckwheat and whole oats<br/>– Fruits and vegetables<br/>– Unsweetened dairy products like yoghurt and milk etc.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Besides the regular food ingredients that we seldom pay attention to, there are several other habits that we should be wary of. Alcohol contains an insanely high amount of calories and abstaining from alcohol is certainly a healthy choice if you have diabetes. From a generation that relied on natural ways of curbing a disease to a generation whose only resort is medicines, we have come a long way. But what we rarely acknowledge is the fact that our health conditions are solely dependent on the lifestyle we’ve chosen and most importantly, the food we eat. Our eating habits determine the extent of most of our health problems, but it’s time we learned how to control that. With these simple healthy eating tips and ingredient check, you will change a lot without actually realizing that you are. Plus, instead of counting on heavy medications, get your minerals and vitamins straight from healthy food items. And don’t forget to add atleast an hour of exercise in your daily schedule. Physical movement is as important as maintaining your diet since it helps the body use insulin more efficiently.</p>
      <p>Well, now that you have a complete diabetes guide with you, it’s time to change your lifestyle for the better. So fill your kitchen boxes with the healthiest of everything and brace yourself for an active and diabetes-free life…</p>
