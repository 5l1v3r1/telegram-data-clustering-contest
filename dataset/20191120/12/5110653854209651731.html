      <h3>George Kittle injury update</h3>
      <p>Kittle’s status for Week 12 won’t be determined until later in the week, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday. He was inactive for Week 11, as expected, with what was listed as a knee and ankle injury. The Niners play Sunday night against the Packers.</p>
      <p>If Kittle misses out again, Ross Dwelley remains a top-10 fantasy play against a Packers’ defense that’s among the worst at defending tight ends. Kittle is obviously an auto-start when active.</p>

      <h3>Even Engram injury news</h3>
      <p>Engram <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanRaanan/status/1196480284738379776">told reporters Monday</a> that it’s “definitely possible” he could make his return in Week 12 against the Bears, also remarking on an “upward trend” in his progress. Engram didn’t practice Monday, though.</p>
      <p>Engram is an every-week start at tight end when healthy, while his backups (mainly Rhett Ellison) aren’t worth considering as possible fantasy plays.<br/><br/><b>WEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/1x0x7s3rojv001j4w68nm8zos7">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1o9fjg2z6mzra1nyyh9xc82iar">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1w752s5mgwmem1ie8oz1iw01e9">Tight end</a></b></p>
      <h3>When will Delanie Walker return?</h3>
      <p>Walker had a new brace for his ankle Monday and is optimistic he can play this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikBacharach/status/1196502099649089536?s=20">he told reporters Monday</a>. He said he’ll need to make a return to the practice field and feel out the ankle before he knows what’s next for sure.</p>
      <p>Jonnu Smith has been seemingly as good as Walker while the veteran has been out. A Walker return would cloudy the waters, because there’d be a share in production instead of it just going to Smith. The Titans host Jacksonville at 4:05 p.m. ET Sunday.</p>

      <h3>Austin Hooper injury update</h3>
      <p>Falcons coach Dan Quinn said Monday that Hooper (knee) is "<a href="https://twitter.com/JasonHButt/status/1196528850634760193">trending in the right way</a>" in his recovery from a sprained MCL. He was originallyexpected to be out until at least Week 14, but Quinn said Hooper could return to practice as soon as Thursday.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: Hooper has been ruled OUT for Week 12.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>It's still highly unlikely Hooper plays this week, but he's obviously worth holding onto until he returns. Jaeden Graham and Luke Stocker received two total targets in his absence, so it's tough to trust either despite a great matchup this week against Tampa.</p>
