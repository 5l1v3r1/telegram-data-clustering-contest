      <p>From a world premiere musical steeped in Native American culture and a rollicking royal show based on the songs of The Go-Go's to the family-friendly magic of Roald Dahl's "Matilda" and the high-heeled hilarity of the Tony-winning "Kinky Boots," Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma is ratcheting up for an eclectic 2020 season.</p>
      <p>And if all that isn't enough, the venerable Oklahoma City professional nonprofit theater will "Grease" the gears with a tuneful theater and movie classic.</p>
