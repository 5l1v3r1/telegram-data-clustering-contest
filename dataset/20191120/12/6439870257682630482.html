      <p>SALISBURY, N.C. (WBTV) - A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicates that a small plane broke up in flight before crashing into an Atlanta town home on October 30.</p>
      <p>Two Salisbury businessmen, 59-year-old pilot Leslie Csanyi Jr. and 60-year-old Scott Robert Lowrie, were killed in the crash.</p>
      <p>Csanyi was a frequent flier for business, vacations, even to deliver much needed supplies to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake.</p>
      <p>The agency says shortly after takeoff from DeKalb-Peachtree Airport, the pilot reported losing the vacuum gauge in the Piper PA-28.</p>
      <p>The report shows that Csanyi experienced trouble turning and maintaining his route, telling the controller over the radio that the plane had “...lost their vacuum gauge.”</p>
      <p>The plane then turned briefly to the northeast before entering a right turn and rapidly descended to 3,700 feet.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the controller told the pilot to maintain “wings level” at 4,000 feet, but there was no response from the pilot.</p>
      <p>The controller tried to contact the pilot several times with instructions to maintain wings level, but received no response from the plane before radar contact was lost.</p>
      <p>The final report from the agency is expected to take several months.</p>
