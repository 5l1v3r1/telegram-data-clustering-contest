      </p>
      <p>Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, seems to be the next manager whose seat in Premier League is threatened after the disgraceful sack of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277255-jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-manager-10-months-losing-man-united-job.html">Mauricio Pochettino's by Tottenham.</a></p>
      <p>The Argentine manager was relieved of his position on Tuesday, November 19, with Jose Mourinho taking over the affairs of the North London side in what signals his surprising yet sensational return to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>The development has put the Arsenal boss' future in big jeopardy as he may be shown the way out of the Emirates Stadium if Arsenal's woeful run of lacklustre performance still continues.</p>

      <p>Arsenal have failed to record a magical resurgence since the former PSG manager assumed Emirates Stadium mantle in a deal that ended Arsene Wenger's lately inglorious reign.</p>

      <p>A torrid Premier League run summed up in defeat to Liverpool during Carabao Cup and disgraceful defeat to Leicester City has left the North London on the losing side with Emery daily sliding down the pecking order with Arsenal management.</p>
      <p>Emery was given Â£100m in the summer to bring in new players but that could not save the Spaniard who is reportedly fighting hard to save his job.</p>
