      <p>Figures revealed by new research into technology in the agricultural sector show that some 82% of farmers who own smartphones (accounting for the vast majority of farmers) use their devices for checking the news.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/technology-advances-in-agri-sector-revolutionary-ifa/">research</a> was conducted on behalf of the Irish Farmers’ Association (IFA) by data specialist Amárach and Skillnet Ireland.</p>
      <p>This figure was revealed to have been the second most often reported use for smartphones among farmers, behind only checking the weather, for which 93% of smartphone-using farmers utilised their devices for.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The survey found that 645 farmers used smartphones in day-to-day life, out of 766 total respondents – representing a figure of 84%.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The research found “widespread use” of smartphones for daily farming activities, with 48% of farmers saying they used their smartphones for farm records management.</p>
      <p>This figure was highest among dairy farmers, with 7 out of every 10 using their smartphones for this purpose.</p>
      <p>Apart from smartphones, 69% of farmers surveyed said they use a laptop or PC; 38% said they used a tablet or iPad; while 2% of farmers said they used neither of these or a smartphone.</p>
      <p>Usage of these devices was closely tied to technology confidence, the report discovered.</p>
      <h3>Confidence</h3>
      <p>In terms of technology confidence, some 49% of farmers surveyed said they were either confident or very confident in technology use, while 39% said they had average confidence. 12% said they were either not really confident or not very confident.</p>
      <p>For those farmers under the age of 35, 88% of them reported themselves as being confident. For farmers aged 35 to 44, this figure dropped slightly to 74%.</p>
      <p>The statistics found that tillage farmers were more likely then farmers in other sectors to claim confidence in technology usage, with 66% of them reporting as such.</p>
      <p>According to the research, technology-confident farmers were more likely to: have completed digital farm training (60% completed training); already be using technology (54% using technology); and invest in farming technologies in the future (59% likely to invest).</p>
