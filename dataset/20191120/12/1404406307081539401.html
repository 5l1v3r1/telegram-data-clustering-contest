      <p>DeHaven opened up about Roc-A-Fella's Emory Jones being indicted and charged in a federal kingpin case and Jones taking a plea deal while DeHaven was still planning to take the case to trial. He explained that his three co-defendants all took plea deals but DeHaven says he knew that the case was falling apart when three strangers to him were added to the case.Â </p>
      <p>During the conversation, DeHaven spoke about feeling that Jay-Z was planning to leave him behind and Jay falling through with a promise to hire a good lawyer for him. When it came time for DeHaven's trial, he was given a public defender, which he felt was the best thing that happened. You can hear the full story above.</p>
