        <i>Thought Thanksgiving was just for Americans? Think again. We round up the surprising pop ups right here in London</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Trump-less Alternative Thanksgiving Dinner</h3>
      <p>Sod the fake news and embrace this seasonal take on the twists and turns of US politics. A lot of the details are still under wraps, but you can expect Sloe Negronis, twice-baked goat’s cheese soufflé, roast turkey wrapped in bacon with all the trimmings, a selection of fruit and pecan pies and a mighty cheeseboard. It’s one for fans of the other massive orange things the U-S-A is famous for. Spoiler alert: they’re pumpkins. <i>Secret Crouch End location. Fri Nov 22. Tickets from £35 including three-course meal; book by email crouchendssc@hotmail.com.</i></p>
      <h3>A Mindful Vegetarian Thanksgiving</h3>
      <p>Whether you’re a full-time veggie or just someone who holds the (correct) opinion that the best parts of any festive meal are the sides, you’re in for a treat at this supper club hosted by cookery writer Heather Thomas. This is no race to see who can scoff the most, though. She’ll walk guests through how to be more mindful in their eating choices during one of the most wasteful times of the year. <i>Divertimenti. Tube: South Kensington.Tue Nov 19. £65.</i></p>
      <h3>Thanksgiving at The Shard</h3>
      <p>Enjoy a slap-up meal with a view 31 floors up at Aqua Shard. Gobble your way through executive chef Anthony Garlando’s three-course menu, featuring traditional American dishes with a luxe twist, such as juniper smoked salmon with pumpkin and black truffle salad or grilled lobster with tarragon hollandaise and cornbread crumble, as well as roast turkey with all the trimmings – while you get to gaze across London like a lord. You do eat with your eyes, after all. <i>Aqua Shard. Tube: London Bridge. Mon Nov 25-Nov 29, special lunch Nov 28 (no dinner option on Nov 28). £75 per person for dinner, £105 per person with wine pairing, £38 per person lunch.</i></p>
      <h3>Thanksgiving Party at The Star of Bethnal Green with Goose Island</h3>
      <p>Goose Island is bringing a bit of good ol’ USA greatness to an East End boozer with a three-course dinner that comes with a limited-edition pint. Most importantly (and Americanly), though, Cash (‘the UK’s number one Johnny Cash tribute act’, fyi) will be playing a cheeky set. Sing along, count your blessings with the massive drinks and merch giveaway, and party on till midnight. Yee-haw. <i>The Star of Bethnal Green. Tube: Bethnal Green. Nov 28. From £20 including three-course meal, pint and entertainment.</i></p>
      <h3>Thanksgiving at Red Rooster</h3>
      <p>Head to the Shoreditch outpost of chef Marcus Samuelsson’s fried chicken joint for a mother-cluckin’, pumpkin-fuelled feast. The menu includes fried chicken and waffles, roast turkey with cranberry and sprouts, ricotta-and-pumpkin gnocchi and pumpkin pie. Plus, you can get buzzed on a complimentary Pumpkin Spice Espresso Martini. Best of all, there’s live music until 2am, so you’ll have time to let the espresso high wear off before bed. <i>Red Rooster Shoreditch. Shoreditch High St Overground. Nov 28. £55 including three-course meal and Pumpkin Spice Espresso Martini.</i></p>
      <h3>Thanksgiving Beer Showcase</h3>
      <p>There’s only one way to celebrate Thanksgiving and that’s to chug, chug, chug! Or just sip on good craft beer. Moncada Brewery is throwing a shindig to showcase its finest American brews to remind us that US brewers have been champions of craft beer for decades. Keep an eye on its social channels for info on the final keg list. Hoppy Thanksgiving! <i>Moncada Brewery. Cricklewood rail. Fri Nov 29. Free entry.</i></p>
