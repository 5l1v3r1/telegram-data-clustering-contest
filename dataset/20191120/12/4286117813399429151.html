      <p>The Lok Sabha on Wednesday saw a written reply from the government in response to a rather unusual question asked by two MPs. The MPs, Upendra Singh Rawat and Kaushal Kishore, asked the Ministry of Railways whether it was aware that MPs have to "feel ashamed in front of their relatives" because tickets under the VIP quota for MPs don't get confirmed during festivals like Holi, Diwali, Chhath etc.</p>
      <p>The MPs asked: "Whether the government is aware that the wait-listed tickets of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar-bound trains on the occasion of Holi, Dussehra, Diwali and Chhath Parv, are not being confirmed on the request of Hon'ble MPs due to which they have to feel ashamed in front of their relatives?"</p>
      <p>In their question, the MPs also sought to know the reasons their waitlisted tickets were not being confirmed under the VIP quota and if the government has any proposal to address the situation.</p>

      <p>In his written reply, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said during peak season the demand for reserved accommodation "outstrips the availability whereas during the lean period the accommodation is generally available in most trains".</p>
      <p>The reply said that during festive seasons and summer/winter vacations, accommodation in important/popular trains gets exhausted within a short time.</p>
      <p>The mister said to meet urgent travel requirements of High Official Requisition (HOR) holders, the Railways has earmarked a limited number of seats/berths as Emergency Quota in different trains and different classes.</p>
      <p>The HOR includes Union ministers, judges of the Supreme Court and high courts, and MPs.</p>
      <p>The reply said seats in this quota are released in accordance with the priority as per 'warrant of precedence'.</p>
      <p>"At the time of allotment of accommodation, emergency quota is first allotted for self-travel of HOR holders/MP etc., strictly as per their seniority in 'warrant of precedence'. Thereafter, other requisitions received from various quarters, including that from MPs are considered and the remaining quota is released taking into account various factors like official status of passengers travelling, nature of urgency like travelling on government duty, bereavement in the family, sickness, job interview, etc."</p>
      <p>The government however clarified that though requests received from MPs for their personal travel are complied with, but in case of requests forwarded by them for relatives etc, at times, it was not feasible to accommodate all such requests when the demand exceeded the availability.</p>
