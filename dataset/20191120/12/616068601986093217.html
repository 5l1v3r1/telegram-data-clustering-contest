      <p>Fong is well known for his watercolour artwork of splendor and whimsy, a blend of contemporary and impressionistic influences.<br/><br/>Fong will be joined by artists Glenna Turnbull, Bobby Vanderhoorn and Dave Watland who will be showcasing and selling original pieces. Partial proceeds from these sales will go towards students in the Culinary Arts program.  <br/><br/>Fong will also be donating one of his pieces that guests will have the chance to win.<br/><br/>“For me, it’s always been about the students,” says Alex Fong. “I had no idea, but each year the Culinary Arts program sends students to Italy where they tour cooking schools and the region, and host a dinner.<br/><br/>“The money raised from this event will go towards this trip. It’s a great opportunity to support a student and allow them to see the world. It is such a big impact on them as people, and something that shapes who they are for the rest of their lives.”<br/><br/>“We’re looking forward to this event, and hope to see a great turn out from the public,” says Dani Korven, Manager, Culinary Arts. “There will be so many beautiful pieces that guests can take home with them, knowing that they are also supporting our Culinary Arts students. We’re grateful to Alex for supporting our students.”<br/><br/>The art show guests will also be able to sample wine from the Valley. Nighthawk Vineyards will be pouring tastings on the Saturday and Vanessa Vineyard will be providing samples on both Saturday and Sunday.<br/><br/>Culinary Arts students and instructors will prepare charcuterie and baked goods. There will also be coffee and tea.<br/><br/>Katherine Neufeld and her class of Floral Design Certificate students from the College’s Continuing Studies department will be providing the decorations for the event to get Infusions into the holiday spirit.<br/><br/>Guests are also encouraged to bring an unwrapped gift for The Kelowna Santas Initiative by Csek Creative that delivers gifts to children in need in the community.<br/><br/>“Kelowna Santas is a grassroots, volunteer initiative that strives to provide a better holiday season for the less fortunate children ages 0-17 that live in the areas of Lake Country to West Kelowna,” says Karen Montgomery, Marketing Associate &amp; Strategist, Csek Creative.<br/><br/>“I think it’s a great initiative and it’s a nice tie-in to our event,” adds Fong. <br/><br/>The event is open to the public and is free of charge.</p>
