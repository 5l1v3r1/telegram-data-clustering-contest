      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/greece.html">Greece</a> will shut down overcrowded refugee camps on islands facing Turkey and replace them with more restrictive holding facilities, according to officials.</p>
      <p>The three centres to be closed - on the islands of Chios, Samos and Lesbos, including its notorious Moria camp - currently house about 36,400 people under terrible conditions that have been repeatedly criticised by rights groups and the Council of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a>. They have a nominal capacity of just 4,500.</p>

      <p>"Decongesting the islands is a priority at this stage," the government's special coordinator for migration Alkiviadis Stefanis, a former army general and chief of staff, told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Greek government said it would replace the camps with new closed facilities for identification, relocation and deportation with a capacity of at least 5,000 people each.</p>
      <p>Smalls camps on the islands of Kos and Leros are also to be remodelled along these lines and enlarged, Stefanis said.</p>
      <p>Instead of being allowed to move freely in and out of the camps, asylum seekers will now be locked up until they are granted <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/refugees.html">refugee</a> status and relocated to the mainland, or rejected and sent back to Turkey, officials said.</p>
      <h3>New restrictions on NGOs</h3>
      <p>Greece's new conservative government, which came to power in July, has pledged to relocate thousands of asylum seekers to camps on the mainland by early 2020.</p>
      <p>It has already passed a law stiffening asylum requirements for migrants and refugees, and has promised to deploy additional border patrols.</p>
      <p>Stefanis also said on Wednesday that new criteria would be issued for the operation of NGOs helping refugees and migrants.</p>
      <p>"Only those [NGOs] that meet the requirements will stay and continue to operate in the country," said Stefanis, who is also Greece's deputy defence minister.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Tuesday accused the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> of treating countries on the bloc's external frontiers as convenient places to house migrants.</p>
      <p>"It cannot go on like this," Mitsotakis told German newspaper Handelsblatt.</p>
      <p>"Europe regards arrival countries such as Greece as a convenient parking spot for refugees and migrants. Is that European solidarity? No! I will no longer accept this."</p>
      <p>The International Organization for Migration last month said that Greece's mainland camps were already nearly full or past capacity. </p>
