      <p>KAMPALA - <b>Med Kaggwa started the day with plans to join other children’s rights activists in the country to celebrate the world children’s day at the United Nations children's fund(UNICEF).</b><br/><br/>These activists’ included Doreen Mulenga, UNICEF Country representative, Mondo Kyateka, ministry of gender, save the children country director Brechtje van Lith and Martin Kizza, the executive director of national children authority.<br/><br/>But Kaggwa was not to make it to the celebrations. He had a different rendezvous with fate as he died on his way to the celebrations.<br/><br/>Reports indicate that Kaggwa fainted on his way to work inside his car around the Mulago round-about in Kampala.<br/><br/>When the distressing news broke to UNICEF and UHRC staff members who were expecting him to be among the panelists, most of them stopped following the day’s events.<br/><br/>“I received the news 20 minutes ago and that is when I stopped listening to what the children were saying I still think it is a lie because I talked to him last evening to remind him of today’s meeting,” said a staff member.<br/><br/>Yesterday during a mock exercise carried out in preparation for the commemoration of World Children’s day in his office, he was in high spirits.<br/><br/>He moved to all departments introducing Mastulla Nassaka, the teenager who had occupied his office for the day as the UHRC chairperson.<br/><br/>“Meet our new chairperson, she will be taking over from me and she is responsible for everything today,” he said.<br/><br/>He made sure that he introduces the girl in all departments, and staff members welcomed their new boss.<br/><br/>“It seems he was saying bye to us, he rarely comes down to our departments but yesterday he was happy while introducing the new boss. He was a good man who wanted to see everyone prosper,” said a staff member who preferred anonymity.</p>
