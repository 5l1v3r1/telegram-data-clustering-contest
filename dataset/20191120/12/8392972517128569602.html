      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> have slammed the soap for creating permanent links between abusers and their victims.</p>
      <p>Viewers know that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> was groomed by school teacher <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a>, who was in a relationship with his father <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-david-metcalfe/">David</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the course of some months, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/emmerdale-fans-want-to-throw-up-as-maya-resumes-affair-with-jacob-in-unwatchable-scenes/">the paedophile groomed the schoolboy</a> into believing they were in a loving relationship and even began sleeping with him just days after he turned 16.</p>

      <p>Eventually <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-cant-wait-until-maya-is-found-out-tonight/">Maya was caught out by David's ex-girlfriend</a> <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-priya-kotecha/">Priya</a> and Maya was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-fans-predict-maya-stepney-will-be-back-for-revenge-in-explosive-christmas-storyline/">sentenced to a year behind bars</a>.</p>
      <p>However in last night's episode of the ITV soap (November 19 2019) <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-maya-is-released-from-prison/">Maya was released</a> after serving just five months of her sentence.</p>
      <p>David, and Jacob's biological mother Leyla, realised they had to tell Jacob about Maya's release.</p>
      <p>Although the teen pretended to be okay, he immediately made his way to the prison, but David managed to stop him.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>David tried to convince his son that seeing Maya would just land her back in prison and told him he would call the police if he went to see her.</p>
      <p>Jacob eventually changed his mind and decided not to see Maya, however he insisted that he would make contact with her one day.</p>
      <p>But he was left upset when Leyla stated that Maya would have contacted him if she wanted to see him.</p>
      <p>However, at the end of the episode, viewers saw Jacob leave Maya a voicemail as she was being released from prison.</p>
      <p>In the message he told her he wanted to be with her, but she quickly deleted his contact from her phone.</p>

      <p>And when the camera panned down, it revealed <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-stunned-as-maya-returns-pregnant/">Maya is pregnant</a>!</p>
      <p>As there is a chance the baby is Jacob's, viewers didn't like the fact the soap had potentially linked Jacob and Maya for life.</p>
