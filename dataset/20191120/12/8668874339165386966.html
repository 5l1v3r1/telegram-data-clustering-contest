      <h1>Coetzee targets 2021 Lions tour after frustration of RWC standby</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Marcell Coetzee aims to put his double World Cup disappointment behind him by starring for the Springboks in their series against the British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> in 2021. In the meantime, though, his full focus is on helping <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ulster">Ulster</a> to Guinness PRO14 and European success.</p>
      <p>Coetzee started the season late because of the ankle injury that put him out of consideration for the Boks squad that won the World Cup in such convincing style in Yokohama two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t part of his Ulster team’s convincing opening PRO14 win over the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> at Kingspan Stadium and also had to watch his team-mates get outplayed 63-26 by the Toyota <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/cheetahs">Cheetahs</a> in Bloemfontein in their second match.</p>
      <p>However, the former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/sharks">Sharks</a> loose forward made his return when the Irish side bounced back to win their second tour match against Southern <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/kings">Kings</a> and has been in the thick of it ever since in, helping Ulster to second position in Conference A in the PRO14.</p>
      <p>“We were not proud of that performance against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/cheetahs">Cheetahs</a> but it helped in that we were quickly able to decide what our weak points were and what we needed to improve on,” said Coetzee. “We went into training on the Monday in Cape Town knowing what we needed to do to break back, and we did that.”</p>

      <p>Coetzee continued the momentum last weekend by playing a starring role in his team’s nail-biting one-point win over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> at the start of their Champions Cup campaign. The defence laid the platform for the winners but in addition to 17 tackles, Coetzee, who was playing at No8, also made 19 carries.</p>
      <p>This series of performances for the Irish province has helped Coetzee to bring some cheer back into his life after he was left pretty inconsolable when, for the second time in the space of four years, he emerged from a meeting with a Springbok coach with the realisation that his World Cup dream was over.</p>
      <p>Coetzee was given a chance to force his way into the 2019 World Cup squad by being selected to face <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/argentina">Argentina</a> in the final warm-up game to be played on South African soil. Early in the game, he was forced off through concussion and then it was confirmed he had an ankle injury which ruled out his availability for the tournament.</p>

      <p>In 2015 Coetzee had to hear in a meeting with Heyneke Meyer that he was left out of the squad that played that World Cup in England, so it was a case of lightning striking twice.</p>
      <p>“It was very disappointing and it wasn’t the first time. Being selected to play that game against the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/currie-cup/teams/pumas">Pumas</a> was a chance to show what I can do but it didn’t go my way. To have the HIA test go against me and then the ankle injury on top of that was very hard to swallow.</p>
      <p>“But in the end ,you have to decide – are you going to just lie down and take it, or are you going to fight back? While it was a tough one for me to swallow, time does heal all wounds. I resolved that I just had to get back on the horse again and start riding again.”</p>

      <p>Coetzee has spent quite a bit of time on the sidelines because of injury in the past few years and it has taught him to just appreciate every minute he does spend on the field. “The biggest thing you learn when you go through serious injuries and then come out of it is that you are blessed to be able to play rugby again,” he said.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/coetzees-terrible-luck-lamented-by-springboks-and-ulster-fans/">It was disappointing to miss out on another World Cup</a>. I can confirm that I was on standby in case there was an injury to a loose forward. But injuries just make you hungry to play again. Whether it is at the highest level, whether it is for Ulster or for the Boks, it is great to just be able to play and focus on that.”</p>
      <p>While Coetzee’s short-term focus is on helping Ulster be successful in both their competitions, he does now have his eye on the iconic tour series that will be played on South African soil in 2021. “Playing against the Lions is definitely my long term goal.</p>

      <p>“It would be great if I can do that. But my focus and energy must be on Ulster. If I do that and perform consistently, and the team performs consistently, then ultimately a door may open and we can see where it goes from there.”</p>
      <p>Coetzee added he was probably the most passionate and perhaps loudest Boks supporter in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> during the World Cup. “We were fans before being rugby players so that never dies in us. I shout a lot at the TV and I shout at the referees. It’s a good thing they can’t hear me. I have great mates in the Boks team, particularly someone like Pieter-Steph (du Toit), and I shared their joy.”</p>
