      <p>Jose Mourinho has always divided opinion but never before has a group of supporters been so split over his appointment.</p>
      <p>Here, two Tottenham fans debate the wisdom of Daniel Levy's decision to select Mourinho as their club's new manager. </p>
      <h3>The case against</h3>
      <p>
        <b>by Alistair Tweedale</b>
      </p>
      <p>I went to bed last night hoping to wake up and realise I had dreamed <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/tottenham-sack-manager-mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino's sacking</a>. Instead, this morning, it had turned into a nightmare.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-manager-replace-mauricio-pochettino/">Jose Mourinho is now Tottenham manager</a> after the most breathless whirlwind of of a 24 hours in my team's history. And I'm not happy about it.</p>
      <p>The jump from Pochettino, a man the fans adore and were keen to stick by through this awful run of form (had he been willing to stay) to Mourinho, the man who destroys relationships and leaves a trail of destruction wherever he goes, is just too big a change to get behind.</p>
      <p>Yes, Pochettino wanted out and it does now seem as though<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/inside-story-mauricio-pochettinos-tottenham-downfall-amazon/"> he had reached the end of the line at Tottenham</a>. Yet even setting to one side the maddening fact that chairman Daniel Levy has allowed this situation to arise - where a host of first-team players are on their way out the club on free transfers, where staleness has engulfed the team, where the best manager Spurs have had in half a century has reached the end of his tether - it's a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

      <p>Pochettino has worked wonders, establishing Spurs as a regular fixture in the Champions League while restricted by a temporary move to Wembley and the financial constraints of the new stadium. He was against the idea of allowing Amazon's fly-on-the-wall documentary but Levy overruled. A chairman should create the best possible conditions for a manager to succeed but Levy did not do that for Pochettino. The manager got on with his job diligently and admirably throughout, without complaint. He deserved better.</p>
      <p>But even having grudgingly accepted that something as major as the manager had to change, getting your head around Mourinho's appointment is still difficult.</p>
      <p>This is a man that gouged the eye of an opposing coach, threw Eva Carneiro under a bus when she tried to do her job and attend to an injured player, who talks disparagingly about fellow managers and constantly shifts the blame onto referees. If Pochettino was the lovable father figure at Spurs, Mourinho is the mean, bitter uncle who nobody wants to host for Christmas.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He has a history of alienating players he does not get on with. He makes demands for expensive signings and is steadfast in his (surely now outdated) belief that one big transfer a year is necessary to shake up a squad. One can only assume Mourinho has been promised money to spend in January, but how frustrating will that be when Pochettino was denied funds and made to endure a period of austerity as the new stadium was built?</p>
      <p>Mourinho is a winner, and the counter argument to all my gripes might be the promise of a trophy. He wins something wherever he goes, but it is genuinely difficult right now to imagine getting behind a defensive style of play propagated by a manager I do not like, particularly when his greatest successes came in a different decade. </p>
      <p>He sacrifices quality of football for a winning mentality, and looking around Europe, it doesn't feel as though many other successful clubs are making that sacrifice these days, so why should my team, who have been so wonderfully entertaining in the Pochettino era, be made to do so?</p>
      <h3>The case for</h3>
      <p>
        <b>by Daniel Wegrzyn</b>
      </p>
      <p>I absolutely love Pochettino. He's a god among men to us, but things have been bad for a while at Tottenham and I don't think anyone at the club truly believed he could turn it around, including - crucially - the players.</p>
      <p>The most important person at Tottenham these days is arguably our talisman, Harry Kane, and a key to success at Spurs is keeping him happy. That means helping him realise his goals there. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/trophyless-frustrated-time-harry-kane-starts-thinking-moving/">For him, success is trophies</a>.</p>

      <p>Winning a trophy become a sort of holy grail. It's the monkey on our back. We can't shake it. Even our greatest manager in 50 years has no trophy to show for his time there. If we define success as winning a trophy - which is reasonable given Tottenham's drought - then there's no question Mourinho is the best man for the job.</p>
      <p>He has won wherever he has gone. Even at Manchester United where clearly things didn't go as well for him as his other jobs, he won the Europa League. I'd be delighted with winning the Europa League!</p>
      <p>Mourinho might not be an appointment that points towards long-term planning, but right now we can afford to think in the short term if winning something keeps the core of the squad happy.</p>
      <p>That could also have other benefits. A two- or three-year Mourinho cycle would allow Levy to restructure the back end of the club, while Pochettino might not have allowed that to happen. In that sense it's poignant that Mourinho's title at Spurs is 'head coach' rather than 'manager'. </p>

      <p>We still have a very strong squad, arguably one better than United's when Mourinho was there. We made exceptional summer signings in Giovani Lo Celso and Tanguy Ndombele. They aren't young players, and are established enough for Mourinho to work with. It is forgotten that Mourinho has made plenty of players world class before and he can help these players realise their potential.</p>
      <p>Even though it is an older squad than when Pochettino took over there aren't many egos around to clash with the new manager. I also think they are so starved of success that they will be receptive to Mourinho. They'll know he's a winner and will be desperate to learn how to win like his previous teams did.</p>
      <p>Anyone complaining about Mourinho's style of football is overplaying the quality of play under Pochettino. The football in the last 12 months has been stodgy at best and even the run to the Champions League final was largely based around hitting a big man up top. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/05/brighton-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/">The performance against Brighton</a> was end-of-days stuff.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is definitely more concerned about the ends rather than the means, but right now, for me, glory comes first.</p>
