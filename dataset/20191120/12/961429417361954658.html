        <b>A teaching trust has said there is “significant” risk it will miss its deficit control total for 2019-20, as it tries to plug a £5.4m savings gap.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bradford Teaching Hospitals Foundation Trust gave the financial update in its latest board papers, as current projections suggest it may only deliver £10.8m of its £16.2m cost improvement programme target.</p>
      <p>A new finance report stated that, although the CIP for the first six months has been achieved, the remaining savings gap “must be resolved” if the control total of a £12.5m deficit (before sustainability and recovery funding) is to be delivered.</p>
      <p>The report said: “The weekly CIP meetings introduced by [chief operating officer Sandra Shannon and finance director Matthew Horner] have resulted in improved projections from the CBUs [clinical business units], however, the pace of progress remains inadequate to give assurance that the control total will be delivered.</p>
      <p>“Equally, the required £3m system savings contribution from collaboration with local NHS partners has not yet been clearly identified.”</p>
      <p>The report added: “The care groups have been tasked with developing detailed recovery plans for executive review and implementation in early November, however, the risk to control total delivery in 2019-20 is now significant.”</p>
      <p>The FT’s worst-case scenario forecast for the end of the year has been adjusted to a £19.5m deficit — £7m off target — and, should BTHFT not meet control totals over the next two quarters, then it will miss out on £8.1m in provider sustainability funding cash.</p>
      <p>A BTHFT spokeswoman told <i>HSJ</i> the trust’s financial plan was for a “challenging, yet plausible” efficiency target of £16.2m to meet its control total.</p>
      <p>She added: “BTHFT has a strong track record of consistently delivering its financial targets for over a decade, and therefore accepted the control total challenge.</p>
      <p>“The trust is making significant progress in identifying measures to improve on the forecast reported to [the] board in November, which reflects a challenging environment, and our formal forecast to the regulators remains full delivery of the £12.5m pre-provider sustainability funding/financial recovery funding deficit total.”</p>
      <p>Although the trust still plans to meet the £12.5m target, the report said achieving this required a “step change” in delivering efficiencies, control of run rates and “wider engagement” across BTHFT in its efficiency programme.</p>
