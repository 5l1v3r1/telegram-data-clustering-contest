      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/igor-bonifacic" target="_blank">Igor Bonifacic</a></address>
      <p>After a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/21/steam-remote-play-together-beta/">brisk, one-month beta</a>, Valve's new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/10/steams-remote-play-together-brings-any-local-multiplayer-game-o/">Remote Play Together</a> feature is now available to all Steam users. As the name suggests, it allows you and up to three other friends to play split-screen games with one another over the internet. It emulates the experience of playing a game on the couch with a group of buddies by capturing your friends' inputs and then streaming it back to your device. Once you're in-game, you can talk to your friends over voice chat.</p>
      <p>What's more, only the host needs a copy of the game, with the three other people joining in on the action through Steam Remote Play. You can take advantage of Remote Play Together whether you're on PC, macOS, Linux or iOS and Android -- just make sure to download the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/14/valve-steam-link-anywhere-beta-game-streaming/">Steam Link mobile app</a>.</p>
