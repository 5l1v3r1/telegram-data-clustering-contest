      <p>Two men have been "boiled alive" after a sinkhole suddenly opened up beneath their car and swallowed up the vehicle with the pair trapped inside.</p>
      <p>The incident in a car park in the Russian city of Penza shocked locals, as it emerged a burst hot water pipe may be to blame for the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Father-of-three Vladimir Valyalkin, 49, was driving in a Lada with Igor Chikasov, 53, in a car park in Penza when the sinkhole suddenly appeared.</p>
      <p>Local reports say the men died instantly.</p>
      <p>It happened so quickly there was no chance to rescue the pair, witnesses said.</p>

      <p>Footage taken just seconds after the incident shows steam rising from the crater of 75C water after the car plunged in.</p>
      <p>A burst hot water pipe is believed to be the reason for the appalling accident but a preliminary criminal investigation is underway.</p>
      <p>Water company T Plus promised to pay compensation to the families of the dead men and meet the costs of their funerals.</p>
      <p>Earlier distressing pictures showed bodies of the men being lifted by crane from the 75C water alongside wreckage of their Lada Largus car.</p>

      <p>“The driver noticed ground beginning to steam - and quickly drove off.  </p>
      <p>“Then these two men came.</p>
      <p>“They parked - and the asphalt collapsed right under them.”</p>
      <p>Local people expressed anger on social media over the horror.</p>
      <p>The victims were colleagues in a furniture-making business, according to Russian reports.</p>
      <p>Valyalkin had an adult daughter and two younger children aged nine and seven, said colleague Alexander Antipov.</p>
      <p>He was a keen angler who had served in a Russian army tank unit.</p>
