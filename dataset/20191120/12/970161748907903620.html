        <b>Ederson is set to return to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> team for their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clash with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> on Saturday after recovering from injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The injury, which was only described as a ‘muscular problem’ by City boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pep-guardiola/">Pep Guardiola</a>, kept Ederson out of the 3-1 defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>It also saw him substituted during the Champions League draw with Atalanta which ended with Kyle Walker in goal after Claudio Bravo was sent off.</p>
      <p>However, City’s goalkeeping woes appear to be at an end after Ederson was pictured in training on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>The Brazilian now looks like he will be back in first team action, as expected, at home to Chelsea in the 5.30pm kick-off on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Guardiola said after the Liverpool defeat on 10 November: ‘Now he’s going to Brazil to recover there, when he comes back hopefully he’ll be fit.’</p>

      <p>The Premier League champions are fourth in the table, one place and one point behind Chelsea, and will be desperate to get back to winning ways against the Blues.</p>
      <p>They remain without long-term injury concerns Leroy Sane, Aymeric Laporte and Oleksandr Zinchenko for the game at the Etihad, and will also be missing Bernardo Silva through suspension.</p>
      <p>However, Guardiola has Rodri and David Silva available to him again after injury.</p>
      <p>City are already nine points behind Liverpool in the title race and cannot afford another slip up as they host a side that has won their last six Premier League games on the spin.</p>
