      <h1>Thunder: Steven Adams still limited by knee injury</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES â€” Nerlens Noel was the Thunder's closing center Tuesday night in a 112-107 loss to the Lakers. Starting center Steven Adams sat on the bench.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we're dealing with Steven's knee still," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said of the decision. "I don't want to say he's on a minutes restriction, but we're trying to be mindful and keep him in a range."</p>
      <p>It wasn't obvious that Adams' left knee was still an issue. A left knee contusion forced Adams to sit three games: Oct. 30, Nov. 2 and Nov. 10. But Adams, including Tuesday, has started OKC's last four games.</p>
      <p>He played 27 minutes against the Clippers on Monday, and 24 minutes against the Lakers on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Adams is averaging 26.3 minutes per game, down from 33.4 minutes last season. His scoring has dropped from 13.9 points per game to 7.8 points per game. Adams, a career 58.6 percent shooter, is shooting 50.6 percent from the floor this season.</p>
