      <p>Rio Tinto's $8 billion expansion of its underground copper and gold mine in Mongolia is headed for another setback as the mining giant fears a court challenge to the validity of the government's 2015 approval agreement looks likely to succeed.</p>
      <p>An administrative court has heard claims by a non-government organisation that the Mongolian government failed to follow due process when its former prime minister<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-gonver.html"> struck the agreement</a> with Rio Tinto chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques.</p>

      <p>Rio Tinto on Tuesday said "early reports" suggested the court has upheld the claims by the group, Darkhan Mongol Nogoon Negdel.</p>
      <p>The court's official ruling will be released in coming weeks, Rio said. In a statement to the sharemarket, the company said it was defending the claims.</p>
      <p>"Rio Tinto strongly refutes any suggestion that the underground development and financing plan or any of the foundation Oyu Tolgoi agreements are illegal," the statement said.</p>

      <p>The Anglo-Australian miner's plans to enlarge the Oyu Tolgoi mine, its flagship growth project, has been beset by a series of delays and cost blowouts since its construction began in 2019. In June, the company issued a warning to investors noting the project could cost as much as $1.9 billion more than forecast.</p>
      <p>Oyu Tolgoi is 34 per cent owned by the Mongolian government and 66 per cent owned by Turquoise Hill Resources, of which Rio Tinto holds a 51 per cent stake. Since 2010, Rio has been the manager of the Oyu Tolgoi project.</p>
      <p>The mine in Mongolia's Gobi desert is the country's biggest source of foreign investment and provides thousands of jobs.</p>
      <p>Rio Tinto, the world's second largest mining company, said it would update the market as further information becomes available.</p>
