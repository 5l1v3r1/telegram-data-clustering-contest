      <h3>Souness calls it common sense for Spurs to sack Pochettino</h3>
      <p>Tottenham's decision to part ways with Pochettino surprised several former players and football pundits alike. But former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/liverpool">Liverpool</a> player and manager Graeme Souness supports Tottenham's decision.</p>
      <p>The Reds legend, who works as a pundit for Sky Sports, explained that he was not surprised by Spurs' decision to sack Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29328/11865422/jose-mourinho-perfect-fit-for-tottenham-after-mauricio-pochettino-sacking-says-graeme-souness">Sky Sports News</a>,</p>
      <blockquote>"He's been a very unhappy bunny. I think it was common sense [for Levy to sack Pochettino] and it was common sense again to go for the guy they have gone for.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Mauricio Pochettino had appeared to be a man who didn't want to be at Spurs, which I find very strange."</blockquote>

      <p>Pochettino has been hailed as one of the best managers in the world, with the Argentine finishing third in The Best FIFA Men's Coach Award after guiding Spurs to their first-ever Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>However, the north London club have been in poor form this season, winning just three of their opening 12 Premier League games, while also losing against League Two side Colchester United in the League Cup.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has succeeded Pochettino at Tottenham.</p>
