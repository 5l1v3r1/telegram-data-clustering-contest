      <p>On any employee's <a href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/3-ways-to-make-new-employees-feel-welcome-even-before-day-one.html">first day</a> on the job, they're likely engaged and excited to <a href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/3-brilliant-tips-to-keep-your-team-engaged-excited-to-do-great-work.html">start contributing</a> to the team. But this <a href="https://www.inc.com/adam-robinson/new-study-finds-employee-enthusiasm-dips-significantly-after-first-few-weeks-heres-why.html">excitement can quickly fade</a> if the job gets off to a rocky start. </p>
      <p>A new <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/survey-6-in-10-workers-met-with-mishaps-when-starting-a-new-job-300959499.html">study</a> from Accountemps, a global staffing firm, found that 59 percent of employees have experienced a mishap when starting a new position. For the study, 1,000 office workers from across the U.S. were surveyed. </p>
      <p>The Accountemps study found that top challenges employees face include, common challenges include technology issues (39 percent), lack of necessary supplies (24 percent), not being introduced to colleagues (21 percent) and not receiving an overview of the company and its policies (20 percent).</p>
      <p>In today's tight labor market, if new employees don't have a smooth start with your organization, they likely won't hesitate to look for roles at other companies. How can your team set new employees up for success? I've outlined some tips below. </p>
      <h3>1. Kick off onboarding ahead of time. </h3>
      <p>One way for you to ensure new hires receive company and policy information before they even walk in the door is by starting the onboarding process as soon as a job offer letter is signed. </p>
      <p>No new employee wants to spend the majority of their first day in the HR office filling out paperwork and learning general information about the company. Instead of relying on outdated paper onboarding and company overview documents, you can tap into digital onboarding to help new hires complete required paperwork before the first day. </p>
      <p>Through digital onboarding, employees can fill out direct deposit information, complete tax forms, fill out benefits paperwork and sign the employee handbook. By reading and signing the employee handbook ahead of time, new hires can be fully up to speed on basic company information and policies before they arrive. </p>
      <h3>2. Ensure employees have all the materials they need to succeed.</h3>
      <p>Another mistake many employers make is not having necessary supplies and technology prepared for a new employee's first day. Ahead of each new employee's first day, set up their desk or work station with general office supplies and anything else they might need. </p>
      <p>If a new employee will be using a company computer or other piece of technology equipment, make sure the technology is ready for the employee to use on their first day.<br/><br/>For example, set up and share a list of important logins, such as the computer login, email password and any other software you think the employee will need to complete day-to-day responsibilities. Otherwise, your new hire might end up sitting at their desk for a significant portion of the first day waiting for technical support, which doesn't make for an engaging employee experience. </p>
      <h3>3. Set aside time for new hires to meet other colleagues.</h3>
      <p>A key way to prevent new employees in particular from feeling isolated is by scheduling time for them to meet colleagues-- both on their direct team and across the company. </p>
      <p>Setting up one-on-one meetings between new employees and their managers is likely a given, but you can also think of other ways to introduce new hires to the rest of your team. </p>
      <p>On my team of more than 200 employees, we set up new employees with a well-rounded calendar during the first week. New hires introduce themselves in front of the company at our weekly all-company huddle. We also schedule a lunch on new employees' second day and for each lunch, we invite several employees from across departments, so new hires can get to know colleagues they might not work with on a day-to-day basis. </p>
      <p>The first day and week on the job can make or break a new employee's overall impression of your company. By creating an engaging employee experience right from the beginning-- and ensuring employees don't run into any easily avoidable roadblocks-- you can keep new hires excited about contributing to your team.</p>
