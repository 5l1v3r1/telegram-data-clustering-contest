      <p>The U.S. Embassy in <b>Bulgaria</b> is pleased to announce that the U.S. Department of State Official Blog <i><b>DipNote</b></i> praises <b>Bulgaria</b> as an ally on which America can depend. The Department of State <b>DipNote</b> states that the Republic of <b>Bulgaria</b> and the United States have cultivated a relationship that is a paradigm of the close ties America enjoys with NATO Allies.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Department of State Official Blog praises <b>Bulgaria</b> for making <b>military modernization</b> a priority and for proactively announcing intent to increase defense spending to 2 percent of GDP by 2024.  Over the last 25 years, the United States has provided more than $340 million in security assistance to <b>Bulgaria</b>, and together the U.S. and <b>Bulgaria</b> work to improve the security environment in Eastern Europe.</p>
