      <p>His red-hot form is attracting plenty of attention from outfits around Europe, and the Ligue One side are believed to be keen on a January transfer bid.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.leprogres.fr/sport/2019/11/19/le-colombien-alfredo-morelos-sur-les-tablettes-de-l-asse">Le Progres</a>, a media site in France, Claude Puel wants the Colombian to add to his side's firepower up front.</p>
      <p>The former Southampton and Leicester City boss is believed to be ready to sanction a move for the 23-year-old when the next window opens in just over a month.</p>
      <p>Last season's Scottish Premiership top goalscorer has continued to impress under Rangers manager Steven Gerrard this season, with 22 of his goals coming at club level for the Light Blues.</p>

      <p>This includes 11 goals in the Europa League, with the frontman shining against the likes of Porto, Young Boys and Legia Warsaw.</p>
      <p>He notched his first international goal for Colombia on Friday night against Peru, and started last night too against Ecuador.</p>
      <p>It's not the first French team to have registered their interest in the attacker, with Bordeaux too monitoring his progress.</p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> also <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10186085/crystal-palace-transfer-alfredo-morelos/">exclusively revealed that EPL side Cyrstal Palace are preparing a £20million bid</a>.</p>
      <p>Fellow English outfit Aston Villa have also been credited with an interest in Morelos.</p>
      <p>Both Rangers gaffer Steven Gerrard and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4949527/ross-wilson-rangers-alfredo-morelos/">director of football Ross Wilson are adamant that the Ibrox club do not need to sell their prized assets in January</a>.</p>
      <p>This came after the club's financial figures uncovered that they'd made an annual loss of £11.3million.</p>
