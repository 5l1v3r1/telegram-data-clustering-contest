      <h1>The ability to auto-equip attachments in PUBG makes its way from consoles to PC in new update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:03:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>PUBG has received a fresh update today with some interesting features.</p>
      <p>This week’s update, 5.2, is available to <b>PUBG</b> players on PC at the moment. The two main additions in the patch are the new spike traps, and a unique test environment called PUBG Labs.</p>
      <p><b>Spike traps</b> work as you’d imagine; you place them in high-traffic areas to flatten the tyres of vehicles. Each trap can only be used once, and cannot be moved once placed.</p>
      <p>After installing the patch, you’ll find the new <b>PUBG Labs</b> tab under Play. PUBG Labs is a space where the developer intends to showcase experimental game modes, balance tweaks and the like. The first test you can opt in is a new skill rating system that aims to better represent player performance in the match.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear if this system will be used in matchmaking in the future, or if PUBG is getting its own competitive playlist. For now, you’ll need to play five matches to get rated.</p>

      <p>The biggest gameplay feature in today’s update, however, has to be the ability to <b>auto-equip attachments</b>. This is actually something <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/28/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-big-change-weapon-attachments/">console players have been able to do for a while</a>, but it’s now arrived on PC. Using three settings, you’ll be able to modify how and when attachments picked up are automatically equipped to your weapon.</p>
      <p>You can have it so that only happens when you pick up items with a keybind, or only when you drag items off the ground (inventory looting). You can also toggle a setting that allows all attachments on your current weapon to automatically transfer to any other weapon you replace it with, assuming they all fit.</p>
      <p>Another gameplay addition is the new <b>waypoint</b> system, which lets you place multi-segment (up to four) lines on the minimap. You can only have one of these active at a time, but they’re helpful for when you want to plot a path for a teammate who’s driving, for instance.</p>
      <p>On the subject of gameplay tweaks, the patch increases <b>swimming</b> (27%) and diving (20%) speeds across the board, allows for 10% faster breath recovery and lets you stay under water for 33% longer.</p>
      <p><b>Vikendi</b>, PUBG’s winter map, has seen some love in 5.2. The map now features more roads, larger patches of frozen-over ice and more vehicles to make it easier to move around. It should also be a bit safer to move on foot – or camp – thanks to new cover and added variation in terrain.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the blue zone has seen a few tweaks on Vikendi. The early safe zones are now larger, but the mid and late-game blue zones are unchanged. Check out the full change log on <a href="https://www.pubg.com/2019/11/13/pc-update-5-2-now-on-the-test-server/">the official blog</a>.</p>
