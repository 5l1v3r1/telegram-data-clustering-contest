      <p>During those times, it’s easier to have streaming devices to watch a new show or crank up a fresh tune. And what’s better than a combo of Amazon Fire Stick and Echo Dot selling for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B07VMBCSSW/?tag=tnw88-20">just $70</a>, instead of $90.</p>
      <p>That’s right. The second generation of Fire Stick with Alexa-enabled voice remote is available in a nifty package with a second generation of Echo Dot.</p>
      <p>Once you pair up these devices, you won’t have to worry about the times when you don’t have your remote handy. You can just ask Alexa to play a certain show or turn the volume up or down.</p>
