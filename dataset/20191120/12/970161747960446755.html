      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-redknapp/">Harry Redknapp</a> has backed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> to sign <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gareth-bale/">Gareth Bale</a> for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been officially unveiled as Spurs’ new manager following the club’s surprise decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese was keen to sign Bale for Manchester United in the summer of 2017 but the Wales international ended up staying at Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>But the possibility of a transfer could arrive in the upcoming January transfer window as Bale remains out of favour with Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.</p>

      <p>‘That would get him on side straight away, the fans would love that.</p>
