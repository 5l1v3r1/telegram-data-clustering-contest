      <h2>Great news for fans of fried chicken</h2>

      <p>A popular fried chicken chain looks set to open two new restaurants near Bristol.</p>
      <p>Miss Millie's is advertising for a general manager at a proposed new branch in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/yate">Yate</a> on job website Indeed and is awaiting planning permission for a second new site in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weston-super-mare">Weston-super-Mare</a>.</p>
      <p>Managing director of the chain Carl Traill told <i>Bristol Live</i> the Yate restaurant is planned for the former Hotcha site in Yate Shopping Centre, but is not yet 100 per cent finalised.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are currently in discussions with the shopping centre and hope to provide an update as soon as possible."</p>

      <p>If plans are approved in Weston-super-Mare, the restaurant will take over the former Co-operative Bank building on the corner of Alexandra Parade and Regent Street.</p>
      <p>In July this year, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/bristol-fried-chicken-chain-miss-3080448">Miss Millie's was sold for an undisclosed sum to a new company</a> in the restaurant sector, which wants to increase store numbers in the South West and beyond.</p>
      <p>The advert on Indeed reads: "We are now ready for the next stage of the Miss Millie's Fried Chicken story as we open several new stores across the South West in 2020.</p>

      <p>"Yate will be the first of our new breed of rebranded restaurants, that will not only offer great food to take away, but also a great dine in experience in our 40 - seater restaurant."</p>
      <p>Miss Millie’s was set up by the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-legend-who-set-up-2906021">late Harry Latham, who opened the first KFC franchise in the UK in 1965</a> with his partner Ray Allen.</p>
      <p>He was good friends with KFC founder Colonel Sanders and decided to name the restaurant after the colonel’s daughter Mildred.</p>
      <p>Harry was managing director of KFC GB in the 1970s before opening stores in Bristol in 1988 under the Miss Millie’s brand.</p>

      <p>Mr Latham retired in 1993 and left the running of the chain to his daughters - Ann Walker, Sheila Wilson, Kerry Baldin and Kate Ostrowski. He <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-legend-who-set-up-2906021">died peacefully on May 23 this year</a> .</p>
      <p>Ann, who was the former managing director, said: "The decision to sell a business that’s been in our family for over 50 years was very tough despite us recognising the time had come."</p>
