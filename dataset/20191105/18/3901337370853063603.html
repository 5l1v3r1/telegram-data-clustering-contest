      <p>Highlands were knocked out of the Telkom Knockout this past weekend following a penalty shoot-out loss to Maritzburg United in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
      <p>Owen da Gama's charges will also be pushing for a return to winning ways after they suffered a 1-0 defeat to Orlando Pirates in Tembisa seven days ago.</p>
      <p>Celtic, meanwhile, have had ample time to prepare for tonight's encounter as they were not involved in cup action this weekend, although they did secure a 1-1 draw with SuperSport United last week Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Free State outfit currently occupy 11th position heading into the encounter, while, the Lions of the North sit in fourth spot.</p>
      <p>Da Gama's troops will feel confident for this encounter, as they claimed the league double over Celtic last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Celtic: </b>16. Mabokgwane, 18. Mashikinya, 26. Ngobeni, 2. Tani, 35. Baloyi, 3. Mahashe, 12. Maema, 27. Tchilimbou, 9. Sera, 24. Lingwati, 8. Phalane.</p>
