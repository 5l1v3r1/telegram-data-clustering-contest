      <p>The Florida rapper and the Indiana singer-songwriter, who are proving themselves as two of 2019’s most exciting rising artists, appear on the Kenny Beats-produced single which arrived online today (November 5).</p>
      <p>“<i>You know I wouldn’t tell you where to go/ Nobody listen to the radio, baby/ We’re bending corners like were running from the sun/ Whip is turning different colors and you’re taking on changes,</i>” Fike raps midway through the song.</p>
      <p>“Hope y’all r vibing,” Apollo tweeted shortly after the song premiered on Zane Lowe’s <i>Beats 1</i> radio show. </p>
