      <h1>A Third Fantastic Beasts Movie is Coming, Whether We Want It or Not</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:00:50+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Cheryl Eddy</a></address>
      <p>The latest film set in J.K. Rowling’s literary landscape will take place in Brazil – and revolve around a character we barely got a glimpse of in part two. Huh. Nothing iffy about those odds!</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/fantastic-beasts-3-jessica-williams-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-1202777066/">Deadline</a> reports that <i>Fantastic Beasts 3</i>, to be directed by <i>Harry Potter</i> veteran David Yates (who also helmed the previous two <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> films) and co-written by Rowling and <i>Potter</i><i> </i>regular Steve Kloves, will begin filming in spring 2020. Notably, this will be the first <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> entry where Rowling has shared scriptwriting duties.</p>
      <p>While the cast that starred in 2016's entertaining <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowling-recasts-harry-potters-magic-for-the-deligh-1789092331"><i>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</i></a><i> </i>and 2018's deflating <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-is-criminal-1830285197"><i>Crimes of Grindelwald</i></a> will be back – Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law, Johnny Depp (sigh), Ezra Miller, Alison Sudol, Dan Fogler, and Katherine Waterston – the story will have an elevated role for Jessica Williams <i>(Booksmart, The Daily Show)</i>, who plays “Professor Eulalie ‘Lally’ Hicks, a teacher at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the American equivalent of Hogwarts.”</p>
      <p>So how does an American teacher find her way to Brazil, considering Deadline lets us know that the film will be set in Rio de Janeiro? Presumably, magic has a lot to do with it; here’s hoping Rowling’s <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowlings-latest-pottermore-story-is-an-american-wi-1787484996">history of fumbling around when it comes to depicting other cultures</a> won’t repeat itself here. Given Rowling’s long history of <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowlings-history-of-magic-in-north-america-was-a-t-1764311530">repeatedly</a>, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowling-finally-addresses-johnny-depp-s-fantastic-1821085145">unabashedly</a> stepping – <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/j-k-rowling-adds-more-fuel-to-the-dumbledore-grindelwa-1833267901">perhaps even stamping</a> – her foot <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/ok-but-why-did-wizards-used-to-shit-themselves-1831499220">into it</a> when it comes to writing and articulating sensitive culture issues in the Potterverse, it seems incredibly likely that it will.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out for sure when the film opens November 12, 2021.</p>
