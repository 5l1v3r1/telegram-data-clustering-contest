        <b>A newly leaked lyric from what appears to be an old Eminem track suggests the rapper sided with Chris Brown after he assaulted Rihanna in 2009.</b>

      <p>The snippet seems to be part of an unreleased version of B.o.B.’s 2011 track <i>Things Get Worse</i>, and has been doing the rounds on social media in recent days.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/chris-brown-lashes-out-against-chvrches-after-they-called-him-an-abuser/">Chris Brown</a> ultimately pleaded guilty for his actions, admitting he ‘felt like a f*cking monster’ after a picture of the singer’s battered face circulated worldwide – yet <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/news/secret-service-investigated-eminem-over-threatening-lyrics-about-trump/">Eminem’s</a> apparent leaked lyrics appear to place him firmly on his side.</p>

      <p>The lyrics were apparently leaked when a Reddit user posted a seven-second snippet – titled ‘(SNIPPET) Eminem – <i>Things Get Worse</i> (Rihanna Diss)’ – of an unreleased version of B.o.B.’s song, according to <i><a href="https://www.insider.com/eminem-verse-leaks-chris-brown-beat-rihanna-things-get-worse-2019-11">Insider</a></i>.</p>
      <p>The version of the song that did get released didn’t mention Chris Brown or Rihanna – but did include multiple references to female celebrities being sexually abused and murdered.</p>
      <p>
        <b>In the short leaked snippet, Eminem can be heard rapping – between voice-overs meant to prevent copyright infringement:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Of course I side with Chris Brown, I’d beat a b*tch down too.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s not possible to link to the clip as the lyrics appear to have been illegally obtained, however the lyric in question has been making the rounds on Twitter since.</p>

      <p>The leaked version of the track is reportedly from recording sessions for the rapper’s 2009 album <i>Relapse</i>, which was released just months after Brown was charged with felony assault. The singer accepted a plea deal, which included five years probation and domestic violence counselling.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time controversy has surrounded Eminem’s lyrics due to his depictions of violence against women; his own mother filed a slander lawsuit against him in 1999 over lyrics on the <i>The Slim Shady LP</i>, and he was sued by his ex-wife, Kimberly Scott, over his song <i>Kim</i>, which describes the rapper violently killing her.</p>
      <p>However, it is the first time the rapper has expressed support for a real-life incident of domestic violence. Usually, his lyrics – although extremely violent and controversial – would all be hypothetical.</p>

      <p>Rihanna and Eminem have since worked together multiple times, most notably on their 2010 hit collab <i>Love the Way You Lie</i> and <i>The Monster</i> in 2013.</p>
      <p>Neither Eminem or Rihanna have commented on the content of the lyrics.</p>
