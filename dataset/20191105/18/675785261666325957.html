      <h1>Erling Braut Haaland asking price amid Man Utd and Liverpool transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>Red Bull Salzburg have reportedly decided on their asking price for in-demand striker Erling Braut Haaland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:07:37+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Red Bull Salzburg are reportedly looking to land a €100million (£86m) fee for star striker Erling Braut Haaland.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian wonderkid has been linked with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and other top European clubs after his stunning breakthrough this season.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old ace, son of former Leeds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star Alf-Inge, has already bagged 12 goals in 11 Austrian top flight games as well as six in three in the Champions League to alert more than 20 clubs.</p>
      <p>Whilst the Austrian champions have publicly declared they do not intend to sell Haaland, Italian newspaper <a href="https://www.tuttosport.com/news/calcio/serie-a/juventus/2019/11/05-63041782/juve-haaland_il_salisburgo_vuole_100_milioni_e_asta_con_real_e_united/?a=2">Tuttosport</a> claim they are already putting out feelers to interested parties.</p>
      <p>They claim that the club are willing to encourage a huge transfer battle as they demand a massive fee for the youngster, knowing top clubs could enter a bidding war.</p>

      <p>Haaland has previously admitted he would love to follow in the footsteps of his father by playing in the Premier League, despite recently labelling speculation over his future "boring".</p>
      <p>The teenager told reports in Austria: "I want to be the best.</p>
      <p>"I have dreamed of playing for the best clubs in the world my whole life, and I especially like English football."</p>

      <p>He impressed under Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Molde and could be reunited with his Norwegian compatriot at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Speaking about Solskjaer, who handed him his senior debut, earlier this season, Haaland told TV2: "He has had a huge impact on my life, both as a person and as a trainer.</p>
      <p>"He won the Champions League and was an incredibly good player. He has taught me a lot."</p>
      <p>But Jurgen Klopp is also said to be an admirer, with Haaland coming off the bench to score at Anfield last month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> are also amongst the clubs said to be interested in handing Haaland his major move.</p>
