      <p>At least 18 people have died and thousands have been arrested amid widespread outbreaks of violence and arson. Chilean president Sebastián Piñera has replaced eight ministers and announced emergency measures to quash the protests, including a small increase in the minimum wage and higher taxes on wealthy Chileans.</p>
