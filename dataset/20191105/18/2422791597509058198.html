      <p>TORONTO -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says China has agreed to allow Canadian meat products into the country.</p>
      <p>China banned the importation of Canadian beef and pork in June, saying some Canadian meat had tested positive for ractopamine, an additive that is banned in China.</p>
      <p>Trudeau tweeted the news Tuesday afternoon, calling it "good news for Canadian farmers."</p>
      <p>China is one of Canada's largest export markets for pork and beef.</p>
