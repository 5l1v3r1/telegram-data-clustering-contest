      <p>Steelmaker <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arcelormittal">ArcelorMittal </a>will not reverse its decision to withdraw from a deal to buy Italian steelmaker Ilva regardless of government efforts to salvage the accord, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arcelormittal">ArcelorMittal </a>announced on Monday it was pulling out of the deal, accusing the Italian government of reneging on a promise to give it immunity from prosecution over a heavily polluting plant in the southern city of Taranto.</p>
      <p>Italy's industry minister said earlier the government might draw up a new norm clarifying the legal protection already in place for the steel firm, but the source said this would not suffice. "Yesterday's letter was final, not the beginning of a negotiation," the source said.</p>
