      <p>Time to consciously uncouple with your slow cooker, because no attempt at chicken dip you ever shove into there is going to hold a candle to this. Iconic hot sauce <a href="https://www.instacart.com/sams-club/products/18020194-frank-s-redhot-chicken-dip-28-oz">Frank's Redhot makes buffalo-style chicken dip</a>, and it comes in what I can only scientifically describe as a massive vat. It is, in fact, 28 ounces, which is a full pound of hot sauce, real chicken, and real cheese. My tortilla chips are already shaking at the majesty of being dipped into this and it has not yet even graced my line of sight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bestproducts.com/lifestyle/a29699684/franks-redhot-buffalo-style-chicken-dip/">According to Best Products</a>, this $8.98 vat of dip is not only available at Sam's Club, but has been now for a couple of years. So perhaps you have already experienced its glory. If not, it comes with handy instructions on how to eat it, should you find yourself too overwhelmed to proceed: “Great hot or cold, this shareable dip packs enough punch to satisfy any hot sauce connoisseur, while not overwhelming those who prefer a milder taste." In other words, those with an iota of patience are free to heat it up in the microwave, while the rest of us will likely be ripping open the resealable container lid and going to town with a giant spoon.</p>
      <p>She is beauty, she is grace — she is a full unrepentant pound of chicken and cheese in your face.</p>
