      <h1>Protesters lock themselves to Washington port to block Trans Mountain pipeline shipment</h1>
      <h2>Five demonstraters, supported by kayakers, have stopped the ship from docking</h2>

      <p>A number of protesters across the border locked themselves to a dock at the Port of Vancouver in Washington Tuesday morning in order to stop a shipment of pipeline for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from getting to B.C.</p>
      <p>According to the Portland Rising Tide, five protesters climbed onto the dock, supported by dozens of kayakers and other boats.</p>
      <p>“This is not just a Canadian problem, but an American problem, too,” Cedar George-Parker, a Tsleil-Waututh Nation member, said in a news release. “We need people in the U.S. to stand in solidarity and take action to stop this pipeline. The border will not divide us.”</p>
      <p>Video posted by the activists at about 10:30 a.m. showed local police officers attempting to detain those on the dock.</p>
      <p>This is the third protest targeting the port since September when activists learned pipe materials were being imported by ship to Washington before being transported by rail to B.C.</p>
      <p>The expansion project was approved for a second time in June, after the Federal Court of Appeal tore up the original approval last year due to insufficient environmental review and inadequate Indigenous consultations.</p>
      <p>Tuesday’s protests come as Saskatchewan was granted leave to intervene in support of the federal government in B.C.’s appeal of the pipeline.</p>
