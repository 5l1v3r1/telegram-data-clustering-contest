      <h1>Seth Meyers' Netflix special lets viewers skip past political jokes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T18:13:52+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 18:13</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler McCarthy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Seth Meyers</a> is known for mocking <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Donald Trump</a> on his late-night show. However, for his upcoming Netflix comedy special, he’s offering viewers the opportunity to skip past his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/political">political rhetoric</a>.</p>
      <p>Fox News confirmed that Meyers’ comedy special “Lobby Baby,” which debuts on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/organization/netflix">Netflix</a> Tuesday, will show those who tune in a button as soon as the topic shifts from the star’s personal life to politics. If pressed, the button will skip to the next segment in which politics aren’t discussed.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately for those who are burned out on political jabs invading their entertainment, it doesn’t look like this feature will be a permanent feature in the streaming service’s application. A Netflix insider told Fox News it was a one-off feature for Meyers’ special and that it was actually the comedian's idea to include it as a sort of fourth-wall-breaking joke.</p>

      <p>“We're thrilled he was able to take advantage of the Netflix experience in such a funny and innovative way," a Netflix spokesperson told Fox News.</p>

      <p>“Lobby Baby,” a likely reference to Meyers’ wife giving birth to their child in the lobby of their <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a> apartment building, includes roughly 8 minutes of skippable political jokes. Those familiar with the former “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/saturday-night-live">Saturday Night Live</a>” writer’s comedy know that lambasting Trump plays a significant role. Prior to taking over “Late Night” in 2014, he hosted the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/white-house-correspondents-dinner">White House Correspondents Dinner</a>, where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA_4G3RtUiI">took jabs at Trump</a>, who was in attendance and remained stone-faced throughout. (Some think it was this very performance that hardened Trump's resolve to run for the top office.)</p>

      <p>After Trump was elected in 2016, the comedian ramped up his “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/politics-on-late-night">A Closer Look</a>” segment on his show, which takes an in-depth look at the political news of the day and often shines an unflattering light on the Trump administration. </p>
