      <p>You're going to be seeing a lot of <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-05/end-of-the-fing-world-series-2-cast/">Naomi Ackie, who plays Bonnie</a><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-end-of-the-fing-world-is-netflixs-darkest-new-show-but-it-wont-actually-bum-you-out-7857512"> </a>on<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-end-of-the-fing-world-is-netflixs-darkest-new-show-but-it-wont-actually-bum-you-out-7857512"> <i>The End Of the F***ing World</i></a>, in the coming months. The British actor joins the Netflix series in Season 2 as a mysterious new character who Alyssa and James encounter. And though she ends up becoming a central part of the story, that isn't the only reason you'll want to remember Ackie's name — her next role is in one of the year's biggest movies.</p>
      <p>Ackie first began gaining recognition in the UK in 2016, when she starred alongside Florence Pugh as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7609875/awards?ref_=nm_awd">Anna in <i>Lady Macbeth</i></a><i>.</i> According to IMDb, she was <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7609875/awards">nominated for an Evening Standard British Film Award </a>for the part, and won a British Independent Film Award for "Most Promising Newcomer." She's also had guest roles on shows like <i>Doctor Who, Vera, </i>and<i> Cleaning Up</i>, was a series regular in the Channel 4/Hulu cult hit <i>The Bisexual, </i>and appeared in Idris Elba's feature directorial debut, <i>Yardie</i>.</p>
      <p>But the most notable and exciting thing about Ackie is that she's one of the new actors <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2019/04/12/star-wars-meet-fresh-face-the-rise-of-skywalker-actress-naomi-ackie/3453924002/">joining the <i>Star Wars</i> universe</a> in <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>,<i> </i>which is due out in December. Similar to <i>The End of the F***ing World</i>, her character, Jannah, is rather mysterious. It's known that she fights on the side of the resistance, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Qn_spdM5Zg">in the movie's trailer,</a> she rides a horse-like creature called an Orbak while carrying a bow and arrow, but that's the extent of what's been revealed.</p>
      <p>Star Wars on YouTube</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-10-30/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-naomi-ackie-jannah">"She's fierce," Ackie </a>vaguely teased of the character to <i>The Los Angeles Times </i>in a recent interview. "She's got a lot of history involved with the issues in the film. Once you find out her story, you're rooting for her and you can understand why she's fighting."</p>
      <p>In fact, it's this spirit that most attracted her to Jannah. "I get angry at things and I want to fight against the system that makes people feel like they're not of worth," Ackie continued. "That means sometimes I can't keep my mouth shut, and sometimes it brings out the warrior in me to have discussions that might not be easy."</p>
      <p>But unlike Jannah, Ackie isn't much of a mystery. She told the <i>Times </i>that she knew she wanted to be an actor by the time she was a teenager, and has also become interested in writing and directing theater. She grew up loving Disney princesses and <i>Star Trek</i>, but it was <i>Harry Potter </i>that eventually pushed her toward film.</p>
      <p>"If there was anything that made me want to be in films more," she said, "it was like looking at [the young <i>Potter</i> cast] and wanting that feeling of being a part of something epic.”</p>
      <p>Come December, that dream will come to to fruition.</p>
