      <p>JERUSALEM:Â Israel's supreme court on Tuesday (Nov 5) upheld a government decision to expel a senior Human Rights Watch official over his alleged support of a boycott of the country, the ruling said.</p>
      <p>Israel has sought to expel Omar Shakir, director for Israel and the Palestinian territories for the New York-based rights group, for more than a year.</p>

      <p>It will now be up to the government whether to follow through and deport Shakir, a US citizen, who brands the move a bid by Israel to silence and delegitimise critics of its treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>"If it proceeds, I have 20 days to leave &amp; it'll join ranks of Iran, North Korea &amp; Egypt in blocking access for @hrw official," Shakir tweeted after the decision was announced, referring to Israel.</p>
      <p>It would be the first expulsion of its kind under a 2017 law allowing the deportation of foreigners who support boycotting Israel, though there have been cases of people being denied entry under the measure.</p>
      <p>The case against him was initially based on alleged statements in support of a boycott he made prior to taking up his post, HRW says.</p>
      <p>The government later added new statements it alleges are in support of a boycott.</p>
      <p>Human Rights Watch says it has criticised Israel's human rights record but has never advocated a boycott - and the same is true for Shakir since he joined the organisation.</p>
      <p>Israel's ministry of strategic affairs, which probes potential violations of the 2017 law, alleges Shakir's activism, particularly related to the country's occupation of the West Bank, has amounted to calls for a boycott.</p>
      <p>The BDS movement - Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions - calls for a boycott of Israel over its treatment of the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Israel sees the movement as a strategic threat and accuses it of anti-Semitism - a claim activists strongly deny.</p>
