      <p>Plans for a direct provision centre in Co. Leitrim remain "paused", after a meeting with the Immigration Minister David Stanton today.</p>
      <p>Ballinamore residents are protesting against proposals to house more than 100 asylum seekers in the town.</p>
      <p>Minister Stanton "paused" the plans recently and he met campaigners again today.</p>
      <p>Both sides have described the meeting as "constructive and open".</p>
      <p>The Minister and the local community issued a statement saying: "The meeting was constructive and open, the group has articulated the communityâ€™s support for asylum seekers and to finding an appropriate accommodation solution in their town, and the Minister thanked the community representatives for their continued engagement.</p>
      <p>"The Minister, his officials and the community group have agreed to meet again in the coming days to continue these discussions."</p>
      <p>Ballinamore campaigner Gordon Hughes said local residents are committed to finding a solution to the dispute.</p>
      <p>Mr Hughes said: "We met with Minister Stanton and his officials again today, certainly we appreciate him meeting us again at short notice.</p>
      <p>"We had further discussions in relation to the meeting we had last week and I think it's fair to say we are trying to find an appropriate accommodation solution for all parties."</p>
