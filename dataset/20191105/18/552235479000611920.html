      <p>Celtic youngster Kundai Benyu has expressed his regrets over his loan spell at Helsingborgs, having failed to make a single appearance since <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/henrik-larsson">Henrik Larsson</a> quit the club.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old joined the Hoops in June 2017, and made his debut against Linfield in a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> qualifier.</p>
      <p>Benyu made one league appearance for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brendan-rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> that season before being loaned out to Oldham Athletic.</p>
      <p>Benyu left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> in February to spend the 2019 Allsvenskan season at Helsingborgs, and from June he was working under club legend Larsson.</p>

      <p>The former striker announced his departure on August 23 though and Benyu didn't make a single appearance after that.</p>
      <p>With the end of the Swedish season his loan deal is at an end and he wrote on Instagram: "Thank you for everything to everyone at HIF.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately the last couple of months of my loan didnâ€™t work out as I hoped, maybe under different circumstances they would have.</p>
      <p>"Good luck in the future."</p>
      <p>In total Benyu made 10 Allsvenskan appearances, scoring once against Falkenbergs.</p>
      <p>Helsingborgs finished the season seven points above the relegation zone in 10th place.</p>
