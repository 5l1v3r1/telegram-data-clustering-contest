      <p>Nigerian firefighters were battling two fires that broke out almost simultaneously at a busy market in central Lagos, the country’s largest city and commercial centre.</p>
      <p>Balogun Market, where the fires erupted, is one of Nigeria’s largest textile markets.</p>
      <p>“We have split our team in two to fight both fires,” Ganiyu Olayiwola, head of the Federal Fire Service in Lagos, said.</p>
      <p>The two fires do not appear to be related, he said, adding that it was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.</p>
      <p>Thick black smoke and flames were shooting up from five-storey buildings surrounding the market as firetrucks attempted to get access to the fire.</p>
      <p>Residents were throwing what belongings they could from the buildings and some people on the rooftops were using small buckets of water to try to stop the fire.</p>
      <p>The fire started in the morning and became a major blaze by midday, with firefighters trying to keep the flames from spreading.</p>
      <p>The Balogun market sprawls across many blocks on Lagos Island.</p>

      <p>It is well known as one of the best places in Lagos to buy colourful Nigerian fabrics, apparel and shoes.</p>
      <p>Fires and other disasters are frequent on Lagos Island where the Balogun market is located.</p>
      <p>In March, at least 20 people, most of them schoolchildren, died with the collapse of a three-storey building housing a school, residential apartments and shops.</p>
