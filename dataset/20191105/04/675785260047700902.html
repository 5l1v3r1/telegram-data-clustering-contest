      <h1>Man Utd and Man City 'closely watching Lorenzo Pirola' at U17 World Cup</h1>
      <h2>The Inter centre-back was reportedly being scouted during the game against Paraguay on Sunday</h2>

      <p>Manchester United and Manchester City are showing interest in Inter Milan defender Lorenzo Pirola and have sent scouts to watch the teenager, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old is yet to make his first-team debut for Antonio Conte's side but is attracting plenty of attention after establishing himself as one of the standout players in Inter's youth teams.</p>
      <p>Pirola is currently representing Italy at the FIFA U17 World Cup in Brazil and has helped his country to advance to the knockout rounds of the competition.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.fcinternews.it/esclusive/fcin-gli-occhi-di-city-e-united-su-pirola-le-big-inglesi-al-mondiale-u17-per-monitorare-il-gioiello-dell-inter-322282">FC Inter News</a> (via <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/manchester-united-manchester-city-keen-17-year-old-watching-u17-wc/">Sport Witness</a> ), the teenager has been observed by both Manchester clubs during their three group stage games.</p>
      <p>The publication reports that the Red Devils have been tracking the teenager for longer and sent representatives to watch him during their second game, a 2-1 win against Mexico.</p>
      <p>However, it has also claimed that Pep Guardiola's side have also joined the race for the defender, with City scouts understood to have been present in their following game against Paraguay.</p>

      <p>Despite opening the scoring with a header after just three minutes for Italy, Pirola wasn't able to help Carmine Nunziata's side to victory as Paraguay won 2-1 to ensure they finished top of Group F.</p>
      <p>Wins from their first two games meant Italy were still able to advance to the Last 16 and will now play Ecuador on November 7 for a place in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Pirola's strong displays at the current World Cup come after a number of impressive performances over the summer at the European Under-17 Championship, where he was named in the team of the tournament as Italy finished as runners-up to the Netherlands.</p>
