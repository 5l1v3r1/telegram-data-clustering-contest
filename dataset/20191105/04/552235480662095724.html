      <p>The National Lottery has revealed the luckiest postcodes in Scotland as part of its 25th birthday celebrations.</p>
      <p>A staggering 5,500 millionaires have been made since the lottery launched in 1994, according to the statistics, and 125 of them are from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> postcode.</p>
      <p>While the city takes the top spot for players banking a seven-figure sum, luck seekers should also look to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/borders">Borders</a>.</p>
      <p>Galashiels has seen the most big winners by local population.</p>
      <p>The statistics by the National Lottery also looked at where players are most likely to win a prize of more than £50,000.</p>
      <p>On average one in every 894 players has banked a big prize since the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lottery">lottery</a>'s launch.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lottery luck also lives south of the border, with the West Midlands winning the top spot for players banking a seven-figure sum, with 168 of them from the Birmingham postcode.</p>
      <p>While traditionally lucky Romford in Essex and Cleveland in the north-east of England have seen one in 922 and one in 952 respectively.</p>
      <p>Data from the last three years suggests Leicester locals have been in luck recently, climbing the top 10 with 30 millionaires made since September 2016.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser for the National Lottery, said: "We go to every corner of the country to pay out big prizes and make millionaires.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"With on average seven new millionaires made every week, you can be sure we'll be visiting somewhere close to you very soon.</p>
      <p>"Over the last 25 years, The National Lottery has been making amazing things happen.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to our National Lottery players, 565,000 Good Cause grants have been given out to projects big and small, that's the equivalent of 200 life-changing projects in every UK postcode district making a huge impact on communities all over the country.</p>
      <p>"On top of this, we have celebrated so many lucky winners who have won life-changing sums of money - here's to another 25 years of making dreams come true."</p>
