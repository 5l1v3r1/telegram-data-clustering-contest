      <p>KULAI, Nov 5 — The Johor government is ready to face any possibilities of floods following heavy rainfall that currently hit the state while the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) examination is underway.</p>
      <p>State Education, Human Resources, Science and Technology Committee chairman Aminolhuda Hassan said the ‘Gerakan Payung’ committee established by the state education department had identified ‘hotspot’ schools statewide.</p>
      <p>He said all those involved in the committee, including education officials, had been trained to deal with any situation and to act quickly.</p>
      <p>Apart from the districts, the committee had also identified the nearest venues to place the candidates in the event of floods, he said.</p>
      <p>“If there is none (school) available, we will transfer them to the hostel nearby,” he told a press conference after visiting the SPM candidates at the Sekolah Menengah (SMK) Kulai Besar here today.</p>
      <p>Also present were Johor Bahru district education officer Shaharuddin Saari and Kulai district education officer Zainal Buang.</p>
      <p>Aminolhuda said candidates would not face any problem to sit for the SPM examination at any school by producing their identity cards, in the case of unforeseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a total of 50,619 candidates in the state sat for the phase two of SPM examination which commenced this morning at 360 examination centres, he said. — Bernama</p>
