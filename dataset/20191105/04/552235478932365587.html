      <h1>Teacher who called Nicola Sturgeon a "drooling hag" selected to stand for election as Tory MP</h1>
      <h2>Kathleen Leslie was also removed from the teaching register after making the comments about the First Minister on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T04:30:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hutcheon, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-hutcheon/</a></address>
      <p>A Scottish Tory who was removed from the teaching register after branding <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/sexism-racism-extreme-right-wing-10437039">Nicola Sturgeon a “drooling hag”</a> has been selected as a general election candidate.</p>
      <p>Kathleen Leslie, who also described the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-lotto-winners-who-scooped-14272838">lottery-winning Weir family</a> as “uneducated fat f******”, will stand for Boris Johnson’s party in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> spokesman said: “It is beyond belief that the Tories think someone struck off the teachers register is suitable to stand for MP.</p>
      <p>“We know the Tories have questionable taste in candidates - but they’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Leslie, at that point a registered <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/education">teacher</a>, unleashed a series of insulting posts on social media ahead of the independence referendum.</p>
      <p>She wrote of Sturgeon: “Wee jimmy krankie is a drooling hag. She’s a walking horror show.”</p>
      <p>Leslie, who taught at Woodmill High in Dunfermline, also wrote: “That wee fish wife was there?! At taxpayer expense no doubt.</p>
      <p>“Feel sorry for poor bugger sat next to her grim face.”</p>
      <p>A complaint was made about offensive tweets to the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) watchdog.</p>
      <p>Leslie admitted her fitness to teach was impaired, and she waived her right to a full hearing because she no longer wished to continue teaching after her election. She quit as a teacher after getting elected to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fife-council">Fife Council</a>.</p>
      <p>The GTCS also barred her from applying to return to teaching for two years.</p>
      <p>At the time, she said: “I chose not to exercise my right to take the issue to a hearing, as I no longer wished to continue teaching, having decided to fully commit myself to representing my ward, ensuring that the interests of my constituents were being served and their voices heard.</p>
      <p>“During my years of teaching I was never under any scrutiny as regards my professionalism and performance in the classroom.”</p>
      <p>Despite agreeing to be removed from the register, she was recently selected by the Tories to contest a seat currently held by Shadow Scottish Secretary Lesley Laird.</p>
      <p>The Tories came third in the seat two years ago after polling over 10,000 votes.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Tory spokesman said: “Kathleen has apologised for the comments she made. She has a great record as a local councillor in Fife and has the party’s full support.”</p>
