      <h1>Shelby American Super Snake Sport F-150 Is A 755-HP Mean Truck</h1>
      <h2>The supercharged V8 sends its power to massive 22-inch wheels.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T04:19:19+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 04:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>If you’re still disappointed with Ford for downsizing the F-150 Raptor’s V8 to a turbocharged 3.5-liter V6, Shelby American can address the “there’s no replacement for displacement” issue by shoehorning a supercharged V8 in the popular pickup truck. It goes by the name of Super Snake Sport F-150 and packs a mighty 755-horsepower punch or five more than the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/146002/shelby-f-150-super-snake/">limited-run Super Snake</a> from 2017.</p>
      <p>Debuting this week in Las Vegas at <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/sema-show/">SEMA</a>, the performance truck is technically a concept vehicle riding low to the ground on large 22-inch alloy wheels shod in performance rubber. The V8 plays its throaty soundtrack courtesy of a Borla exhaust system and has the visual presence to support its aggressive note thanks to a meaner body kit with rocker panels and a custom hood.</p>

      <p>The bumper and grilles have been modified up front compared to the standard <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/f-150/">F-150</a>, while the rear hosts a tonneau cover to enable a cleaner appearance. Stripes and badges complete the look. There are a handful of changes inside the cabin as well where there’s now a new set of floor mats and a gauge replacement, while the carbon fiber accents and the leather upholstery are exclusive to the amped-up <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a> truck.</p>
      <p>The performance truck tweaked by <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/shelby-american/">Shelby American</a> also benefits from an upgraded six-piston front brake system and a modified coilover suspension bringing the F-150 closer to the road. All of the goodies have created what the company refers to as “a nightmare for any other truck,” with in-house tests showing the Super Snake is “astonishingly fast.”</p>

      <p>If you’d rather have a V8 engine straight from Ford in your F-150, rumor has it the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/reviews/379043/2020-ford-mustang-shelby-gt500-first-drive/">Shelby GT500’s</a> 5.2-liter supercharged V8 could be installed in the pickup truck. It churns 760 hp in the flagship ‘Stang model, which would be a massive bump over the 450 hp offered by the current <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/raptor/">Raptor</a>. Meanwhile, Shelby American would be more than happy to offer a similar level of power as the GT500 with its new Super Snake Sport.</p>
