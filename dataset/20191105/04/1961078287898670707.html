      <h1>Black Cat Takes the Field at N.F.L. Game</h1>

      <p>New York Giants fans do not see things running into the end zone as often as they would like, so they’ll take what they can get.</p>
      <p>A black cat ran onto the field during a Monday Night Football game at MetLife Stadium, flummoxing would-be corrallers as it danced along the goal line and, eventually, darted into the end zone to the wild cheers of the crowd.</p>

      <p>At first, the cat seemed unsure of its red-zone approach. With 5:32 left in the second quarter, it appeared on the 8-yard line, bringing the arguably less interesting contest against the Dallas Cowboys to a halt. It scurried to the 5, then to the 2, pausing as if waiting for the referee to set the ball for the next play.</p>
      <p>With a flair for the dramatic, it stopped just inches from the goal line. Would it stop short of pay dirt? Would this be yet another disappointment at a Giants home game?</p>
      <p>It would not — the cat delivered. In a flash, it took off into a full sprint, galloping triumphantly into the end zone. The crowd went wild, both in the stadium and in homes across the nation.</p>
      <p>“The cat runs into the end zone! That is a touchdown!” Kevin Harlan <a href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1191543390577528834">announced on Westwood One radio</a>.</p>
      <p>“He’s got great lateral movement,” declared Joe Tessitore, an ESPN announcer.</p>
      <p>State troopers and stadium workers chased the cat behind the end zone, and it went about as well as you’d expect. Less than a minute later, it ran through a tunnel and exited the field, forcing everyone to watch football again. (The Cowboys ended up winning, 37-18.)</p>
      <p>There is a storied history of animals interrupting sports games and bringing everyone joy. Football has historically been vulnerable to squirrel breaks, including one <a href="https://krod.com/lambeau-field-squirrel-trending-on-social-media-after-packers-loss/">critter that became beloved in Green Bay</a> in 2016.</p>
      <p>Cats have appeared on baseball diamonds on several occasions, including one that scampered through the outfield of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/sports/miami-marlins-cat.html?module=inline">a Miami Marlins game in 2017</a>, evading capture for a delightful amount of time.</p>
      <p>Sadly, not all animal-sports intersections turn out well. R.I.P. to the bird that famously collided with a Randy Johnson fastball in 2001.</p>
