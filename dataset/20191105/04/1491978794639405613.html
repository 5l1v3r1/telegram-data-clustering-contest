        <i>Erdoğan aide praises arrest amid hopes for ‘trove of intelligence’ from Rasmiya Awad, who was seized in Syrian border town</i>
      </p>
      <p>Turkey claims to have captured the sister of killed Isis leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a> and is interrogating her and her husband and daughter-in-law, who were also detained.</p>
      <p>A senior Turkish official told Reuters that Rasmiya Awad, 65, was seized on Monday during a raid near the Turkish-controlled northern Syrian town of Azaz. When captured, she was also accompanied by five children.</p>
      <p>“We hope to gather a trove of intelligence from Baghdadi’s sister on the inner workings of Isis,” the official said.</p>

      <p>Little independent information is available on Baghdadi’s sister and Reuters was not immediately able to verify if the captured individual was her.</p>
      <p>Fahrettin Altun, the communications director of Turkish president Tayyip Erdoğan, called the arrest “yet another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations”.</p>
      <p>“Our determination to bring justice to those who seek to terrorize our people and destabilize our region cannot be questioned,” <a href="https://twitter.com/fahrettinaltun/status/1191490873160282112">he wrote on Twitter</a>. “We have been leading in the fight against terrorism in all its forms.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/28/visual-guide-to-the-raid-that-killed-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi">Baghdadi killed himself last month</a> when cornered in a tunnel during a raid by US special forces in north-western Syria. Isis confirmed in an audio tape posted online on Thursday that its leader had died and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/baghdadi-raid-video-released-as-us-general-warns-of-isis-reprisal-attacks">vowed revenge against the US</a>.</p>
      <p>Baghdadi had risen from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself “caliph” of all Muslims, holding sway over huge areas of Iraq and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/syria">Syria</a> from 2014 to 2017 before control was wrested away by US-led coalition forces including Iraqis and Syrian Kurds.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/islamic-state-new-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-abu-ibrahim-al-hashimi-al-qurayshi">Isis said a successor to Baghdadi</a> identified as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi had been appointed. A senior US official last week said Washington was looking at the new leader to determine where he came from.</p>
      <p>World leaders welcomed Baghdadi’s death, but they and security experts warned that the group, which carried out atrocities against religious minorities and horrified most Muslims, remained a security threat in Syria and beyond.</p>
