      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Building greater trust and transparency will be the main focus in raising professional and ethical standards of bankers to prepare them to combat financial crime.</p>
      <p>Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers (AICB) chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim said it is vital for the bankers to have a code of ethics that promotes honesty, accountability and ethical conduct to maintain the highest levels of integrity in their professional practice.</p>
      <p>“We can invest in the best anti-crime financial tools technologies and have the best policies in place, but if we do not have the people and capacity to implement them this effort will be useless.</p>
      <p>“With this, we will be able to cultivate a culture of professionalism which will further contribute to raising the reputation of the banking industry and ultimately strengthen public trust,” he said in his welcoming remarks during the two-day International Conference of Financial Crime and Terrorism Financing (IFCTF 2019) today.</p>
      <p>Organised by AICB, the conference which began today covered topics and case studies related to fraud, combating corruption and bribery, conduct risk, proliferation financing and cybersecurity.</p>
      <p>Themed, “Building Trust and Transparency: Collaborate, Accelerate, Strengthen”, the event attracted the participation of 1,300 delegates from the public and private sector, including regulators and financial practitioners.</p>
      <p>They will be enlightened on the latest regulatory updates, new tools and technologies to take on financial crime and implement more effective and efficient preventive controls.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad is scheduled to deliver a special address this evening and launch a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) initiative to combat financial crime. — Bernama</p>
