      <h1>Nick Offerman Thinks Everyone Should Know How to Change a Tire</h1>
      <h2>‘Parks and Rec’ Legend Nick Offerman Talks Masculinity While Eating Hot Wings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T05:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.askmen.com/authors/ashley_keegan" target="_blank">Ashley Keegan</a></address>
      <p>Nick Offerman, known as the snarky yet loveable Ron Swanson from “Parks and Recreation,” recently sat down for an all-you-can-eat spicy wing session with Hot Ones host Sean Evans.</p>
      <p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href="https://www.askmen.com/news/food_booze/nick-offerman-launching-his-own-lagavulin-scotch.html">Nick Offerman Taps Into Inner Ron Swanson With Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch</a></p>
      <p>The pair dove right into the good stuff — hot wings and hot topics — beginning with the similarities and differences between Offerman and the iconic character he brought to life. The comedian was asked to share how much he related to a few classic Swanson zingers, including  one on masculinity and personal responsibility:</p>
      <p>"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Don't teach a man to fish, and you feed yourself. He's a grown man and fishing isn't that hard."</p>
      <p>Though Offerman says he differs quite a bit from his Swanson character in real life, he does find some relation to this line. "I think that makes a lot of sense," he said. "We're too mollycoddling in this modern age of consumerism where you are never left on your own to learn to survive." </p>
      <p>The pair delved further into the dichotomy of modern masculinity as a way of distraction from their scorched mouths. Offerman recalls a time he met Mr. T, admiring the actor's surprising combination of both toughness and sensitivity.</p>

      <p>"He had this whole message of treat your mother right and use good manners, so I've always really loved, you know, a big tough guy who also was sensitive and promoted that,” he said. “So when I met him, I just was absolutely blown away."</p>
      <p>Also an excellent craftsman, Offerman takes time to highlight the importance of being handy and using tools to make things with your own hands in between bites. He points out that the end result of something you assemble might not be as attractive as that pre-packaged purchase from IKEA, but it will hold a lot more meaning for generations to come.</p>
      <p>And being handy? That’s something that’ll go a long way in life. According to Offerman, everyone, regardless of gender or sexuality, should know how to do basic things like use a screwdriver or change a tire.</p>
      <p>"Things break, and those of us who know how to fix things when they break just end up being better, responsible members of our community," he said.</p>
      <p>If you can believe it, language and feminism even came up as points of conversation when Evans asked if Offerman thought it made more sense to refer to a weak person as a "nutsack,” rather than a "p*ssy,” as nutsacks are more vulnerable. As a comedy writer, Offerman admits that using those words for the purpose of a punchline and indicator of weakness goes way back to his days in the locker room. However, he sees things differently today.</p>
      <p>"I now stop myself," he stated. "I don't want to do that because that, I think, fortifies the genderization I'm trying to work against.”</p>
      <p>He thinks there’s some hope for the future of men harnessing an ideal combo of masculinity while also being sensitive to others’ feelings.</p>
      <p>"Slowly, we're just going to have to keep evolving."</p>
