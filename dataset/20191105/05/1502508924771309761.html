      <p>Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday said Maharashtra's next chief minister will be from his party, as the deadlock to form a new government in state continued after election results on October 28.</p>
      <p>"The politics of Maharashtra is changing...in our fight for justice, we will win," said Raut, who is also a member of the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>"The decision on Maharashtra will be taken in Maharashtra, the chief minister will be from the Shiv Sena," Raut said in Mumbai, ruling out a role for Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>The Bharatiya Janata Party won 105 seats, its ally Shiv Sena 56, the NCP 54, and Congress 44 in the elections. The Shiv Sena has been demanding the chief ministerâ€™s post after elections gave the saffron alliance a combined seat strength of 161, way past the 145 majority mark in the 288-member House.</p>
