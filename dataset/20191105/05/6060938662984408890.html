      <p>FUZHOU (China): World Champion PV Sindhu suffered a shock defeat to lower-ranked <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pai-Yu-Po">Pai Yu Po</a> of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chinese-Taipei">Chinese Taipei</a> in the opening round to be ousted but India's doubles campaign was off to a good start in the $700,000 China Open on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>World No.6 Sindhu, who made early exits in China, Korea and Denmark, lost 13-21, 21-18, 19-21 to World No.42 Pai in a 74-minute women's singles match here.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Satwiksairaj-Rankireddy">Satwiksairaj Rankireddy</a> gave the Indian camp reason to be cheerful with twin victories in the men's and mixed doubles categories.</p>
      <p>Thailand Open champions Satwik and Chirag Shetty, who had reached the French Open final last month, defeated the American pair of Phillip Chew and Ryan Chew 21-9, 21-15 to set up a second-round meeting with sixth seeds Japanese Hiroyuki Endo and Yuta Watanabe.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Satwik and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashwini-Ponnappa">Ashwini Ponnappa</a>, ranked 30th, defeated Canada's Joshua Hurlburt-Yu and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Josephine-Wu">Josephine Wu</a> 21-19, 21-19 to make a positive start in the mixed doubles competition.</p>
      <p>They will face fifth-seeded Korean pair of Seo Seung Jae and Chae Yujung next.</p>
      <p>In men's singles, HS Prannoy, who has recently recovered from dengue, faltered in the opening round, losing 17-21, 18-21 to Denmark's Rasmus Gemke.</p>
      <p>The women's doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and N Sikki Reddy was blown away 9-21, 8-21 by World No.10 Chinese pair of Li Wen Mei and Zheng Yu in 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>In the women's singles match, Sindhu, who had reached the quarterfinals at French Open in her last outing, came into the match with a 3-0 head-to-head record against Pai but it was the 28-year-old Taiwanese, who took the initiative early, opening up a 3-0 lead in the opening game.</p>
      <p>Though Sindhu made it 4-4, Pai was 8-4 ahead before making it 11-5 at the break. The Taiwanese didn't take her foot off the pedal and moved to 12-8 before reeling off eighth straight points to zoom to 20-8.</p>
      <p>Sindhu saved five game points before Pai earned the bragging rights after sealing the opening game.</p>
      <p>In the second game, Sindhu dished out a better performance, opening up a 7-4 lead and then maintaining it at the interval. The Indian kept moving ahead and roared back into the contest, despite a stiff challenge from Pai.</p>
      <p>Pai got her act together in the decider as she once again dominated the proceedings early on, surging to 8-2 before making it 11-3 at the breather.</p>
      <p>The experienced Sindhu then came up with nine points on the trot to catch up with Pai but the Taiwanese managed to held on to a 15-12 lead.</p>
      <p>A fighting Sindhu once again gathered six consecutive points to move to 18-15. But four straight points once again gave Pai the lead and she capitalised on it, sealing the issue in the end.</p>
