      <p>SIOUX FALLS, Nov 5 — A South Dakota man convicted of fatally stabbing a former doughnut shop co-worker during a 1992 burglary was put to death by lethal injection last night, after the US Supreme Court denied three 11th-hour petitions to stay his execution.</p>
      <p>Charles Rhines, 63, whose lawyers argued that his death sentence was tainted by anti-gay bias toward him on the part of jurors, was pronounced dead at 7.39pm CST at the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls, prison spokesman Michael Winder said.</p>
      <p>Rhines' execution had been scheduled for early in the afternoon but was delayed for several hours while state corrections officials awaited word from the US Supreme Court on his final appeals.</p>
      <p>All three applications for a stay were rejected by the high court yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>Rhines, a high school dropout, was found guilty of murdering Donnivan Schaeffer, 22, an employee at Dig 'Em Donuts in Rapid City, during a burglary of the doughnut shop on March 8, 1992, weeks after Rhines had quit working there.</p>
      <p>Schaeffer was found stabbed to death inside the shop, his hands bound, with about US$3,000 (RM12,473) in cash and checks missing, according to court documents in the case. A jury sentenced Rhines to death for the killing in January 1993, four days after convicting him.</p>
      <p>In an application for a stay filed on Friday, Rhines' lawyers asked for a court review of evidence that some jurors knew Rhines was gay and believed he would enjoy life in prison with other men if he were spared the death penalty.</p>
      <p>The petition, which cited statements by three jurors acknowledging that Rhines' sexual orientation was an issue for that reason during sentencing deliberations, was denied by the high court without comment.</p>
      <p>“It is very sad and profoundly unjust that the state of South Dakota today executed Charles Rhines, a gay man, without any court ever hearing the evidence of gay bias that infected the jury’s decision to sentence him to death,” federal public defender Shawn Nolan said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Separately, defence lawyers filed a petition seeking a court order compelling the state to allow medical experts to examine Rhines for evidence of mental illness, such as autism, that might have served as a mitigating factor in his sentencing.</p>
      <p>Appellate lawyers also sought to stay the execution while the high court considered Rhines' request to be put to death by means of a lethal-injection protocol no longer used by South Dakota.</p>
      <p>Those two petitions were likewise denied.</p>
      <p>Rhines became only the fifth South Dakota inmate put to death since the US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionally of the capital puni</p>
