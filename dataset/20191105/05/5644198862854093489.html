      <p>Caterpillar Inc has laid off 120 temporary workers at a plant in Texas following its decision to cut production in the wake of a fall in sales due to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China.</p>
      <p>CHICAGO: Caterpillar Inc has laid off 120 temporary workers at a plant in Texas following its decision to cut production in the wake of a fall in sales due to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China.</p>
      <p>The layoffs, which took place at the hydraulic excavator facility in Victoria on Nov. 1, were confirmed to Reuters by a company spokeswoman on Monday. The facility had about 820 employees.</p>

      <p>Kate Kenny, Caterpillar's spokeswoman, attributed the decision to "market conditions."</p>
      <p>Caterpillar shares closed up 1.7per cent at US$146.92.</p>
      <p>In October, the world's largest heavy equipment maker said it was taking steps to cut production after sales fell across all product segments and in most regions in the latest quarter.</p>
      <p>Sales in Asia-Pacific, its third-biggest market, fell 13per cent as Caterpillar faced falling demand in China and competition from cut-price domestic rivals, while revenue in its main developed world market in North America fell almost 3per cent.</p>
      <p>The Illinois-based manufacturer said trade tensions made customers wary of committing to large capital expenditures, hitting quarterly profits and forcing a cut in its full-year profit outlook. It expects the uncertainty to result in lower sales this year.</p>
      <p>Kenny did not say whether the production cuts would lead to a workforce reductions at other facilities. When asked, she said Caterpillar was taking "a variety of actions at its global facilities to align production with demand."</p>
      <p>Caterpillar, an industrial bellwether and proxy for global economic activity, benefited in the past year from the strongest global growth since 2010. However, a tariff war between the United States and trade partners, including China, has sapped business confidence and weakened the global economy.</p>
      <p>Last month, the International Monetary Fund warned that the Sino-U.S. trade war will cut 2019 global growth to its slowest pace since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, adding that the outlook could darken further if trade tensions remain unresolved.</p>
      <p>Henry Guajardo, who runs Workforce Solutions - a state-funded local workforce development agency - said the affected employees were all production workers.</p>
      <p>Since Caterpillar notified his agency about the layoffs at the Victoria facility, Guajardo said dozens of workers have come to his office seeking help in securing a livelihood.</p>
      <p>Other manufacturers have also let go of workers, citing weak demand. Last month, farm equipment maker Deere &amp; Co announced indefinite layoffs for 163 manufacturing workers.</p>
      <p>In September, analysts at Moody's Analytics estimated the trade war had cost almost 300,000 jobs in the United States.</p>
