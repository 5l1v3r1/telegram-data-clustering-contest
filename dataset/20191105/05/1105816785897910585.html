      <h1>Pakistan-India Davis Cup tie shifted to 'neutral' venue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T05:37:16+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 05:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>This month’s Davis Cup tie between Pakistan and India, scheduled to take place in Islamabad, must now be played at a “neutral venue” due to security concerns, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said Monday.</p>
      <p>The Asia/Oceania Group I match had initially been planned for September, but was pushed back to November 29-30 after safety fears were raised by India amid tensions between the neighbouring nations over Kashmir.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the ITF said the decision to move the match was taken “following a review of the latest advice given by the ITF’s independent security advisors.”</p>
      <p>“The ITF and Davis Cup Committee’s first priority has always been the safety of athletes, officials and spectators and the decision was made on this basis,” the ITF said.</p>

      <p>According to Davis Cup rules, “the Pakistan Tennis Federation now has the choice to nominate a neutral venue and has five working days to confirm their proposed venue,” it added.</p>
      <p>“The venue will be announced once the choice has been submitted and approved.”</p>
      <p>Tensions are simmering between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan since August when New Delhi revoked the special status of Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and imposed a barbaric clampdown in the disputed territory.</p>
      <p>An Indian tennis team last played a Davis Cup tie in Pakistan in 1964, when they beat the hosts 4-0. Pakistan lost 3-2 when they played in Mumbai in 2006.</p>
