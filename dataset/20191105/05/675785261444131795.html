      <p>A teen mum who had returned to the boxing ring after a maternity break has been found dead in her home.</p>
      <p>Nicola Rattray, 18, died on Friday <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/young-mum-teen-boxing-star-20810048">the Daily Record reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Her daughter Breigha was only born in March last year.</p>
      <p>Megan Gordon, who represented Scotland at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, said: “Heartbreaking, shared the ring with Nicola many times in exhibitions and in training and can’t give her one fault.</p>
      <p>“All thoughts go out to her family and her gorgeous little baby.”</p>

      <p>The night before she’d been sparring at her boxing club’s Merkinch Hall gym.</p>
      <p>Coach Laurie Redfern said: “She was looking better than ever. She seemed happy.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe it when I was told next day. It’s tragic. They’re a very nice family, it’s difficult.</p>
      <p>“We’re all gutted as you can imagine. She was just 18. She was a lovely girl.”</p>
      <p>Within hours of shocked friends learning of the tragedy, an online fund had been set up to support Nicola’s daughter.</p>
      <p>Alaina Macleod launched the gofundme page ‘Raising for baby B’ on behalf of Nicola’s mum Gillian on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In under 24 hours it had already raised just short of £3,000.</p>

      <p>Alaina’s page stated: “On the 1st of November everyone’s life was shattered when we found out the devastating news of Nicola Rattray.</p>
      <p>“Everyone who knew Nicola would know how much of an amazing girl she grew up to be and still is.</p>
      <p>“Nicola was talented in so many ways such as being part of the pipe band, having a passion for boxing and most importantly being the best mummy to baby B.</p>
      <p>“This time of year is hard for everyone, especially being so close to Christmas.</p>
      <p>“We all want Breigha to grow up and remember her mummy loved her.</p>
      <p>“Nicola’s close friends and family have agreed to set up a gofundme page for Breigha.</p>
      <p>“We would like to raise as much money as we possibly can to make sure Breigha has the best future. Just how Nicola would want it.”</p>
      <p>The boxing club closed over the weekend out of respect for Nicola and her family.</p>
      <p>Former pro boxer and Scotland coach Laurie, 71, a volunteer at Inverness for more than 25 years, spoke of his shock.</p>

      <p>He said: “Her father was on the phone to me the night it happened.</p>
      <p>I’ve still to go and see them but will give it a day or two.</p>
      <p>“Nicola won her last contest at the Ironworks in the first round, and I think it’s the happiest I’ve ever seen her.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big stage for anyone in Inverness and it made her day.</p>
      <p>“After having her baby she decided to join our club. It took her a wee while but she got stuck in and really worked at it.</p>
      <p>“She made her debut for us at the Ironworks in September and won her bout in the first round.</p>
      <p>“She just overwhelmed the other girl and the referee stopped the contest.</p>
      <p>“She was so, so chuffed. She was running all over the place.”</p>
      <p>Condolences for her parents Gillian and Len and sister Lauren were posted on social media.</p>
      <p>Christine Graham said: "I have memories of Nicola from my daughter Eilidh’s Brownie and Guides days.</p>
      <p>“Eilidh follows Nicola on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> and is very fond of her and admires the person and mother that she is.</p>
      <p>“We were heartbroken and send all our love and support to you all.”</p>
      <p>Kira Amanda Horne posted on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> : “I can’t believe I’m writing this absolutely devastated Nicola Rattray I grew up with you.</p>
      <p>“You could’ve messaged me. I can’t believe this. I’m gonna miss you so much.</p>
      <p>“You were such a light to this world. Oh Nicola man gonna miss you so much.”</p>
      <p>Police Scotland were approached for comment but had no information.</p>
      <p>However it is believed there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding Nicola’s death.</p>
      <p>The appeal can be found on gofundme by searching for "raising for baby b".</p>
