        <b>The Mexican Administration of Property and Disposal Service [SAE] - which initiated the auction - estimates the value of six real estate properties located in Culiacan, Sinaloa, at about Mex$19,430,000 or some $1,000,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most remarkable property is a modest-looking, single-story house said to be worth about $127,287, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7648133/Six-houses-seized-drug-kingpin-El-Chapo-auction.html">The Daily Mail broke the news</a> on Monday. The house has, however, the most gripping history among other properties of notorious drug kingpin Joaquin Guzman, also notoriously known as El Chapo ('Shortie').</p>
      <blockquote>The media report said that Mexican law enforcement agencies <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910071076981506-hitmen-el-chapos-rival-gang-joker-style-/">stormed the steel-armored doors</a> of this building on 17 February 2004 in hopes of apprehending the violent drug lord. El Chapo, however, escaped through a tunnel hidden underneath a bathtub before he was finally captured a week later.</blockquote>
      <p>That military operation reportedly led Mexican authorities to the notorious discovery of a complex tunnel system beneath the compound connecting all six houses.</p>
      <p>The most expensive lot, however, valued at Mex$11,224,445, or $587,000, was previously purchased by El Chapo for Griselda LÃ³pez, the mother of his son, Ovidio Guzman Lopez, who is wanted by the US, The Daily Mail said.</p>
      <blockquote>The luxurious three-story house has multiple bedrooms and an outdoor backyard swimming pool. According to the UK-based media report, an attempt to capture Guzman Lopez in October was fumbled by the Mexican government in an operation that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910181077079414-mexican-security-council-to-move-to-sinaloa-after-gut-battle-over-el-chapos-son---minister/">saw at least 13 people killed</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>All six houses are fully furnished with working TV sets, washing and drying machines, microwaves and exercise equipment used by El Chapo.</p>
      <p>Mexican authorities reportedly hope to give all earnings from the auction sale - scheduled later this week - to local needy children in the southwestern state of Oaxaca, The Daily Mail said.</p>
      <p>El Chapo faced several court trials but repeatedly escaped justice. He was captured in 2016 and extradited to the United States in 2017. In July, a US federal judge sentenced him to life in prison plus 30 years on various charges <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201909291076918572-el-chapos-cartel-claims-responsibility-for-killing-colombian-politician--reports/">related to his leadership of the Sinaloa Cartel</a>.</p>
