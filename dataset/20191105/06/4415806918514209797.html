      <p>Coronation Street’s Roy Cropper gets a shock when he discovers a family he never knew existed.</p>
      <p>Viewers of the ITV soap will next week find out that Roy (David Neilson) has been doing some more digging into his mother’s secret life and has unearthed evidence of a son she had during her affair.</p>
      <p>When he finally tracks down his brother Richard Lucas (Paul Bown) he is surprised to find he has a teenage daughter Nina – and she is less than impressed with Uncle Roy’s sudden appearance.</p>
      <p>When Roy discovers Richard is seriously ill he agrees to take responsibility for his niece’s welfare, but will he regret taking in another troublesome teen?</p>

      <p>Neilson said: “The storyline is a great device to bring Roy’s niece Nina into his life, a new relationship with a younger character, a troubled young person in the same way as he took in Wayne, Fiz, Becky and even cared for Carla when she was struggling. It is an interesting dynamic.</p>
      <p>“Roy works well when he has something to focus on, a problem to solve or someone to look out for, particularly someone who others may see as a bit different. Roy can identify with that as he has been an outsider himself.</p>
      <p>“It is interesting and it puts him on his mettle.”</p>
      <p>Goth Nina is actress Mollie Gallagher’s first TV role.</p>
      <p>The actress, 21, said: “I am absolutely delighted to be in Coronation Street.</p>
      <p>“I grew up watching the show and it is surreal to be on the set working alongside such incredible actors as David Neilson and Alison King.</p>
      <p>“Nina is a really interesting character, she is a bit of an outsider and although she is reluctant to let Roy into her life she soon realises they have more in common than she first thought.”</p>
