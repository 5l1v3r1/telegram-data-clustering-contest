      <p>LONG BEACH, Calif. (KABC) -- An outpouring of grief continued Monday for a 3-year-old boy and his parents, all whom were <a href="https://abc7.com/boy-dies-after-suspected-dui-crash-on-halloween-that-killed-dad/5666914/">fatally struck by an alleged DUI driver</a> in Long Beach while the family was out trick-or-treating on Halloween night.<br/><br/>A makeshift memorial was growing at the crash site near Los Cerritos Park, where the tragedy occurred shortly before 11 p.m. on Thursday.<br/><br/>Raihan Awaida, 32, and her husband, Joseph, 30, were walking on a sidewalk trick-or-treating with their son Omar when they were hit by a 2002 Toyota Sequoia that was headed southbound on Country Club Drive, according to Long Beach police.<br/><br/>Joseph Awaida's death was announced Friday. His young son died the following morning. Raihan Awaida succumbed to her injuries Sunday evening, police said.<br/><br/>The driver of the SUV, who was arrested at the scene on suspicion of DUI and gross vehicular manslaughter, remained free Monday after posting $100,000 bail. He was identified by authorities as Carlo Navarro, 20, of Long Beach.<br/><br/>"Should have kept him locked up, kept him locked up," Long Beach resident Kenny Bayer said while visiting the memorial. "Homicide, motor-vehicle homicide - don't let him go, he's going to go out and kill somebody else now.<br/><br/>"It's just unbelievable. I'm just broken-hearted."<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the crash, <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-memory-of-joseph-awaida">GoFundMe </a>and <a href="https://www.launchgood.com/campaign/yousef_awaida__family#!/">LaunchGood</a> pages were created to help pay for funeral expenses. By Monday afternoon, they had collectively raised more than $356,000.</p>
