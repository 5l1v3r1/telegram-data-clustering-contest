      <p>The New York Giants surrendered a 12-3 second-quarter lead to crash to their fifth successive defeat as the Dallas Cowboys ran out 37-18 winners at MetLife Stadium.</p>
      <p>Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott was intercepted off his very first pass but recovered to throw for 257 yards and three touchdowns to leave the Cowboys 5-3 for the season and top of the NFC East.</p>
      <p>New York, in contrast, have now fallen to 2-7 for the campaign following this latest loss.</p>

      <p>The Giants started well and Cody Latimer’s touchdown plus two Aldrick Rosas field goals helped them build a nine-point lead midway through a second quarter which was briefly delayed by a black cat strolling across the pitch.</p>
      <p>However,  Dallas hit back with 10 points in quick succession – including a 42-yard touchdown by Blake Jarwin – to earn a 13-12 half-time lead, and they never looked back.</p>

      <p>The last time the Cowboys were in East Rutherford was a month ago when they lost to the stadium’s other tenants, the New York Jets.</p>
      <p>This time there was no upset result as they added further touchdowns through Michael Gallup and Amari Cooper to secure the victory.</p>
