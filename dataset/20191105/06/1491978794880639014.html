      <p>A couple reported missing after failing to turn up to their respective jobs have died after falling from Kearneys Falls in Far North <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a>.</p>
      <p>The couple – a woman, 32, and a man, 24, both from Townsville – were reported missing on Monday after failing to turn up to their respective jobs.</p>
      <p>A search began after the alarm was raised and a friend let police know where they had gone camping.</p>
      <p>Their bodies were found at Kearneys Falls late on Monday after a search of the Goldsborough bushland.</p>
      <p>Police said on Tuesday it appeared to be misadventure.</p>
      <p>They believe the couple slipped and fell to their deaths after climbing the steep falls, but don’t yet know when.</p>
      <p>The man had picked his partner up from Cairns airport on Thursday after she returned from holidaying in Japan.</p>
      <p>They were planning to camp for a few days before returning to Townsville, police said.</p>
      <p>The bodies were flown out by helicopter because the site is difficult to access.</p>
      <p>The Kearneys Falls walking track and viewing platform are 850 metres from a camping area in the Goldsborough Valley section of Wooroonooran National Park.</p>
      <p>Queensland Parks said that section of the park will be closed until Saturday.</p>
      <p>The walking track and viewing platform are temporarily closed for maintenance work.</p>
