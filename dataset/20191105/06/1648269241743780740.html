      <h1>2021 Kia Optima Returns In Dramatic Design Sketches</h1>
      <h2>Official renderings, but the real deal won't be this attractive.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:44:36+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>Unless <a href="https://www.motor1.com/kia/">Kia</a> has plans that we’re not aware of to spin off the Optima into a sleek coupe, these fresh teasers are a case of when something is too good to be true. <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/366331/2021-kia-optima-spied/">Spy shots</a> from August revealed the next generation will stick to the midsize sedan formula, so these renderings published by Hyundai South Korea on <i>Facebook</i> are just the automaker’s way of building up hype ahead of the car’s imminent local reveal as the K5.</p>
      <p>After Hyundai upped its styling game in this segment with the gorgeous <a href="https://www.motor1.com/hyundai/sonata/">Sonata</a>, Kia will be doing the same with its sister model. Yes, it won’t be nearly as dramatic as these new sketches are suggesting, but <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380342/kia-optima-look-exclusive/">our own renderings</a> based on more eloquent teasers released in recent days depict an attractive <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/sedan/">sedan</a> with sharper styling. We’re particularly fond of the headlights with their funky Cadenza-esque “L” LED daytime running lights as well as by the slim taillights stretching across the fastback-like rear end.</p>

      <p>The heavy sloped roofline teased here won’t have a correspondent on the actual production model, but the 2021 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/kia/optima/">Optima</a> is expected to boast some coupe traits to enable a more exciting profile. We’d be interested in seeing a real coupe derived from the sedan, but we wouldn’t get our hopes up too high as it would make more sense for the sportier <a href="https://www.motor1.com/kia/stinger/">Stinger</a> to lose the rear doors yet there’s no sign of that happening.</p>
      <p>We already know there are going to be some important changes inside the cabin where Kia will significantly change the dashboard by merging the digital instrument cluster with a wider infotainment system. The lower center console will lose the bulky gear lever for a much smaller rotary shifter, while some of the buttons will be erased since their respective functions are going to be built into the touchscreen display.</p>

      <p>While the KDM-spec K5 is expected to debut anytime soon, the U.S.-spec Optima will probably be revealed next year as a 2021MY.</p>
