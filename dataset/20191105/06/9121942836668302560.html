      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — The founder of Spanx was revealed to be the successful bidder for the skintight satin pants that Olivia Newton-John wore in the movie “Grease.”</p>
      <p>Sara Blakely told “CBS This Morning” Tuesday she plans to frame the pants and hang them at Spanx’s headquarters in Atlanta because they inspired the company’s black faux-leather leggings.</p>
      <p>Blakely bid $162,500 for the pants, which Newton-John had to be sewn into for the 1978 film.</p>
      <p>Blakely says she is huge fan of Newton-John, who sang at Blakely’s wedding.</p>
      <p>Newton-John says she’s excited Blakley purchased them.</p>
      <p>Julien’s Auctions says the leather jacket that Newton-John’s character, Sandy, wore fetched $243,200, bringing the total for the outfit to $405,700.</p>
      <p>The proceeds from the jacket and pants, as well as a portion of the other items sold, will go the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness &amp; Research Centre in Australia.</p>
