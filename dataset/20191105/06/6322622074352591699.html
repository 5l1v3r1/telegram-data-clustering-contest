      <p>* USD/MYR is little changed at 4.1510 after dropping to 4.1467, lowest since Aug. 2; pair declined for 8 straight days through Monday</p>
      <p>* Sixteen of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast Bank Negara Malaysia will leave its benchmark rate at 3%; the remainder forecast a 25bp cut</p>
      <p>** Decision is due at 3pm local time</p>

      <p>* Malaysia’s 10-year bond yield is little changed at 3.41%</p>
