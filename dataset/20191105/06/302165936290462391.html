      <h1>Citizenship broker denies taking on Jho Low as client, says responsibility lies with Cyprus govt</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Broker firm Henley &amp; Partners explained today that it had rebuffed Low Taek Jho as a client, amid claims that the fugitive billionaire has acquired Cypriot citizenship.</p>
      <p>The firm also asserted that, in the case of the man also known as Jho Low, the responsibility to process and approve such an application lies with the government — who is also in a position to annul Low’s application.</p>
      <p>“Contrary to what has been stated in multiple articles, Low has never been a client of Henley &amp; Partners.</p>
      <p>“Whilst he approached Henley &amp; Partners in 2015, the firm declined to accept Low as a client,” the firm said in a statement to Malay Mail.</p>
      <p>The firm said it has invested significant time and capital in the past two decades to create a corporate structure that implements best practices and employs the highest levels of due diligence, even before passing a client over for the consideration of a sovereign state.</p>
      <p><i>Politis</i>, a Greek-language newspaper in Cyprus, first reported that Low obtained the passport from the island state in the Mediterranean by allegedly engaging global passport and citizenship broker Henley &amp; Partners.</p>
      <p>The firm pointed out that it has never been approached to comment on the allegations involving the firm by any media organisation in advance.</p>
      <p>“We have not therefore had the opportunity to engage with the articles or the ‘evidence’ presented, which has been taken entirely out of context to fit a narrative that does not represent an objective assessment of the situation,” it said.</p>
      <p>In a report by <i>Cyprus Mail</i>, Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades has since said his country should terminate the passport of fugitive financier Low if reports of its existence are verified.</p>
      <p>Anastasiades’ country came under global attention after it was alleged that Low, or Jho Low, used its so-called “golden passport” scheme to effectively purchase his citizenship there.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, <i>Politis</i> revealed that Low applied for and secured the passport through the government-backed Cyprus Investment Programme, with the alleged endorsement of the country’s Christian Orthodox Archbishop Chrysostomos II.</p>
      <p>Until recently, Low had been thought to be hiding out in China and controlling his remaining business interests from various parts of the country.</p>
      <p>After his US$1 billion (RM4.15 billion) settlement with the US Justice Department last week, however, a spokesman of Low appeared to taunt authorities by saying he was offered asylum “by a country that acts in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Convention on Human Rights.”</p>
      <p>Low remains wanted by authorities in Malaysia, the US and Singapore.</p>
