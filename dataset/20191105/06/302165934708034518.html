      <h1>Study: Nearly two in three cigarettes sold in Malaysia are now smuggled</h1>

      <p>IPOH, Nov 5 — The sale of illegal cigarettes rose nationwide, according to the Illicit Cigarettes Study (ICS) released by the Japan Tobacco International Berhad (JTI Malaysia) today.</p>
      <p>The study was commissioned by the Confederation of Malaysian Tobacco Manufacturers (CMTM).</p>
      <p>It was conducted between June and August 2019.</p>
      <p>It showed estimated illegal cigarette sales went from 59.7 per cent during the March-May study to 64.6 per cent in the latest.</p>
      <p>JTI Malaysia managing director Cormac O’Rourke said rise was deeply worrisome for Malaysia.</p>
      <p>“To think that any legitimate industry can be corroded to this extent to the benefit of criminal gangs casts Malaysia in a poor light on the international stage,” he said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The study found sales to have spiked in all states except Kedah and Perlis, with Kuala Lumpur rising by 9.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>The ICS is done three times a year and is based on discarded cigarette boxes collected nationwide.</p>
      <p>O’Rourke acknowledged attempts to dispute the ICS data but asserted that not credible alternative has been published.</p>
      <p>“This is a national crisis that needs to be addressed holistically by all the relevant institutions of the state,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said increasing regulation on legitimate tobacco firms would only worsen the issue.</p>
      <p>He then repeated the industry’s calls for a ban on cigarette transshipment and a moratorium on duty and excise increases.</p>
