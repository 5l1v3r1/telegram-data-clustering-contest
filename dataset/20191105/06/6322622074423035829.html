      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): Genting Malaysia Bhd's wholly-owned subsidiary Genting (USA) Ltd (GenUSA) had on Monday (Nov 4) purchased 13.2 million shares in Empire Resorts Inc from Kien Huat Realty III Ltd (KH) at US$9.74 a share under the planned Genting Malaysia-KH joint venture to privatise US-listed casino operator Empire.</p>
      <p>"Following the proposed acquisition, GenUSA now holds a 38.3% equity stake in Empire on an undiluted basis and 33.3% on a fully diluted basis assuming full conversion of all preferred stock currently outstanding into Empire's common stock.</p>
      <p>"The obligation of GenUSA and KH to consummate the proposed acquisition is independent of, and not conditional upon, the proposed merger," Genting Malaysia said.</p>
      <p>On Aug 6 this year, Genting Malaysia said in a Bursa filing that Genting Malaysia and KH had on Aug 5 entered into a binding term sheet for GenUSA to acquire the 13.2 million shares in Empire at US$9.74 each for about US$128.6 million (RM538.8 million).</p>
      <p>Genting Malaysia via GenUSA will together with KH submit a preliminary non-binding proposal to Empire to acquire by merger the outstanding shares held by shareholders of Empire unaffiliated with KH at US$9.74 each, according to Genting Malaysia.</p>
      <p>At Bursa Malaysia's midday break today, Genting Malaysia shares settled up three sen or 0.93% at RM3.27. The stock saw 6.18 million shares traded.</p>
