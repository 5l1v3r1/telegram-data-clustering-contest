      <h1>When the company that made your prosthetic feet won't repair them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:42:18+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Erin Ehm's insurance company will buy her a new set of prosthetic feet every three years, but her $6,000/foot Echelon VT hydraulic prosthetics break down every 10 months.</p>
      <p>Erin's feet are now out of warranty, but she doesn't yet qualify for a new insurance-funded replacement, and one of them has broken down. She contacted the manufacturer, Blatchford UA (formerly Endolite) and asked them if she could pay for a repair, but Blatchford "would not repair them for any cost. Full stop." But they did offer to sell her a new one.</p>
      <p>Erin depends on her prosthetic feet for everything (as you might imagine!): both the physical activities that keep her fit, healthy and happy, as well as everyday necessities like driving her car, which has not been fitted with hand-controls.</p>
      <blockquote>Last week I “blew out” the hydraulics on one of my feet. It was a foot that had been repaired under warranty in 2017, then stored in my closet until just a couple weeks ago as a backup emergency pair. I need emergency feet, because if I can't walk, I can't really do much. I can't take my son to school or make him meals. I can't drive to work. Not to mention the fact that I can’t leave the house to do any of the things I enjoy. I don't own a wheelchair and wouldn't know the first thing about navigating the world in one. My cars don't have hand controls. Let it be known that I acknowledge that I am extremely privileged in disabled society for the record. But if I had no feet, it would be a seismic shift for me and my family. As if becoming disabled all over again.</blockquote>
