      <h1>The Reviews Are In: It’s Time To Get Excited About The New ‘His Dark Materials’ TV Show</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:23:08+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:23</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Lenton</a></address>
      <p>If there’s one show we should all be excited about, it’s HBO’s adaptation of <a href="https://junkee.com/his-dark-materials-new-trailer/224071"><i>His Dark Materials</i>.</a></p>
      <p>It’s being touted as the next HBO show to replace <i>Game of Thrones</i>, but to be honest, that comparison is already extremely tired. The highly anticipated show is an adaptation of the extremely beloved Philip Pullman books, and is a joint venture between the BBC and HBO.</p>
      <p>The series sits slightly within the shadow of the 2007 film adaptation, <i>The Golden Compass,</i> which was a critical and commercial flop. All of this means that people have been excited.. but nervous.</p>

      <p>And it’s understandable to be nervous — the books aren’t just loved, they’re also brilliant and ambitious. They follow the adventures of a young girl named Lyra, who uncovers the corruption of the theocratic organisation that runs her world. But it doesn’t there — it deals with notions of alternate realities, the philosophy of innocence, and a surprisingly deep and bitter vein of atheism.</p>
      <p>The is apparently fairly faithful to all that — so it’s a little more than simply swinging swords and riding horses. Although, tbf, there’s a lot of magic and wonder too. Armoured bears! Daemons!</p>
      <p>ANYWAY. The first reviews are in, and people are mostly cautiously optimistic. There’s a lot of criticism going on — but the general consensus is you should watch and we should all find out how this will end.</p>

      <h3>Meant For Television</h3>
      <p><a href="https://slate.com/culture/2019/11/his-dark-materials-hbo-adaptation-review.html">Slate</a> points out that TV has the scope for this story that film was always going to lack, saying that <i>His Dark Materials</i> is “Proof that TV is now the best medium for bringing epic literary fantasy to the screen”</p>
      <p><a href="https://time.com/5711058/his-dark-materials-hbo-review/">The Times UK</a> said: “Even the most anal nitpicker would struggle to pick a fight with the inspired casting and lavish production values, especially Ruth Wilson as Mrs Coulter and Dafne Keen as Lyra, who put in the standout performances.”</p>
      <p>In fact, a lot of the praise is reserved for the casting, specifically for Dafne Keen’s Lyra. Keen had an absolute stellar role in <i>Logan</i>, and continues in much the same vein. Ruth Wilson’s Mrs Coulter is also supremely noteworthy.</p>

      <h3>Daemons and Bears</h3>
      <p>“The connection between human and daemon is central to the success of the series and for the most part, <i>His Dark Materials</i> makes it work.” Explains <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/his-dark-materials-review-hbo-1202187054/">Indiewire.</a> ” The use of puppets during filming allowed the actors to form real connections with creatures typically inserted after the fact. It’s necessary and it works to great effect.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/arts/television/review-his-dark-materials-hbo.html?partner=IFTTT">The New York Times</a> says: “HBO’s Philip Pullman adaptation loses some of the books’ edge, but gains stunning imagery (think armored polar bears).”</p>
      <h3>The Writing Though?</h3>
      <p>Kathryn VanArendonk from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/his-dark-materials-hbo-review.html">Vulture</a> gives an extremely measured review, but this this sting in the tail:</p>
      <p>“<i>His Dark Materials</i> first episodes are a mixture of unabashedly gorgeous visuals, several strong performances, and writing that demonstrates time and again that it has no confidence in either of those things.”</p>
