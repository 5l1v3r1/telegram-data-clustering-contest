      <p>EDINA, Minn. (AP) — Police in a Minneapolis suburb have arrested a suspect after a swastika and other offensive graffiti was found at an elementary school.</p>
      <p>In an email to Edina School District families, Superintendent John Schultz wrote that “when an act of hatred occurs anywhere in Edina, it affects our entire community.”</p>
      <p>Police say the arrest occurred Monday after the suspect was caught on security video. The vandalism happened over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Star Tribune reports Schultz says the district has turned to the Jewish Community Resource Council for guidance as they work through the issue.</p>
