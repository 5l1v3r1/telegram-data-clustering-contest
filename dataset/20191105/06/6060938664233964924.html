      <p>Arjun had kept this look from the upcoming periodic drama under wraps for a long time and used to don a cap whenever he used to step out for a few months but his first look seems to justify the suspense now.</p>
      <p>'Panipat' which is being helmed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashutosh-Gowariker">Ashutosh Gowariker</a> also features Padmini Kolhapure, Zeenat Aman and Mohnish Bahl in supporting roles and is slated to release on 6th December.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the other hand, Janhvi has her kitty full with an interesting line-up of films comprising of 'Gunjan Saxena-The Kargil Girl', 'Dostana 2', 'Roohi Afza' and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Karan-Johar">Karan Johar</a>'s magnum opus periodic film 'Takht'.</p>
