      <p>A 48-year-old knife-wielding man who allegedly slashed two people and bit off part of the ear of a politician has been arrested, along with two men who attacked him in return, Hong Kong police have said.</p>
      <p>Senior police official John Tse said the man struck a couple with a knife outside a mall late on Sunday after an argument.</p>
      <p>Mr Tse said the assailant, whose name was not given, was then beaten by an angry crowd, including two men aged 23 and 29.</p>
      <p>All three were arrested following the incident.</p>

      <p>Five people were injured, including two who were in critical condition, police said.</p>
      <p>“We do not tolerate any form of violence regardless of one’s motive and political stance. We will certainly investigate fully and bring offenders to justice,” Mr Tse said.</p>
      <p>Local media cited witnesses as saying that before going on a rampage, the man told his victims that Hong Kong belongs to China.</p>
      <p>Television footage showed the man suddenly grabbing district councillor Andrew Chiu by the neck and biting his ear when Chiu tried to stop him from leaving after the attack.</p>
      <p>A man was left unconscious on the ground in a pool of blood.</p>

      <p>The incident occurred shortly after police stormed the mall and several other shopping complexes to thwart anti-government protests as tensions continue to mount after five months of unrest in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Although Mr Chiu is a pro-democracy politician, it was not clear if that played any part in the attack.</p>
      <p>“It shows that tempers are flaring up despite government claims to promote reconciliation,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Centre for China Studies at Hong Kong’s Chinese University.</p>
      <p>“It’s a sign that the situation is getting out of hand. People are losing patience and throwing rational judgment to the wind.”</p>
      <blockquote>Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong</blockquote>
      <p>Mr Tse said police arrested 325 people over the weekend.</p>
      <p>“Rioters’ destructive acts serve no other purpose than to vent their anger and grievances, real and imagined. Continuing this rampage is a lose-lose situation for Hong Kong,” he said.</p>
      <p>His comments were made through a Facebook Live broadcast after police called off their news conference when six journalists staged a protest and refused to leave.</p>
      <p>Wearing helmets with words that read “Investigate police violence, stop police lies,” they were protesting against what they said was rising police violence against journalists covering the protests.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations began in early June over a now-shelved plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, but have since swelled into a movement seeking other demands, including direct elections for Hong Kong’s leaders and an independent inquiry into police conduct.</p>
      <p>Many protesters are angry that Beijing is slowly infringing on the freedoms guaranteed to Hong Kong when the former British colony returned to Chinese control in 1997.</p>
      <p>There are no signs the unrest could stop any time soon as the government has refused to budge and Beijing has indicated it could tighten control over the territory.</p>
