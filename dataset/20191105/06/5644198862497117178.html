      <p>SANTIAGO: A strong 6.0-magnitude earthquake shook Chile on Monday (Nov 4), rattling buildings in the capital while a big anti-government demonstration was under way.</p>
      <p>The quake struck at 6.53pm (2153 GMT) with its epicentre near the northern town of Illapel, the US Geological Survey said.</p>

      <p>A strong and prolonged shaking was felt in the capital.</p>
      <p>Chile's National Seismological Centre measured the quake at magnitude 6.1, revising down an earlier estimate of 6.3.</p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.</p>
      <p>"There have been no reports of damage to people, disruption of basic services or infrastructure," the National Emergency Office said.</p>
      <p>The Army Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service said the quake was unlikely to cause a tsunami on Chile's Pacific coast.</p>
      <p>When the quake hit, police in Santiago were dispersing protesters at the start of the third week of anti-austerity protests targeting the conservative government.</p>
      <p>Chile is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries.</p>
      <p>The 9.5-magnitude 1960 Valdivia earthquake was the strongest ever recorded on the magnitude scale, according to the USGS.</p>
      <p>In 2010 an 8.8-magnitude followed by a tsunami killed more than 500 people.</p>
      <p>Chile lies on the Ring of Fire - an arc of fault lines that circles the Pacific Basin and is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>
