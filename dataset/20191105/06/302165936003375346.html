      <h1>Bukit Aman anti-terror chief says Malaysia has own yardstick to classify groups such as LTTE</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Bukit Aman counter-terrorism chief Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay said today Malaysian authorities have their own standards to identify security risks, even if Washington no longer viewed the LTTE as a terror group.</p>
      <p>Ayob said the police have “solid” standard operating procedures and security guidelines to measure such threats, as he defended the arrests of local suspects allegedly linked to the now-defunct Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.</p>
      <p>“We are a sovereign nation, we have our own SOP and it is solid,” the Bukit Aman anti-terror chief told reporters at the 2019 International Conference on Financial Crime and Terrorism Financing (IFCTF) here.</p>
      <p>Some reports suggest the LTTE has been removed from Washington’s list of terror organisations, although <i>Malay Mail</i> could not verify this at the time of writing.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it is continuously monitoring organisations that allegedly support and promote terrorism activities around the world, and not just the Sri Lanka-based LTTE.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah said the ministry took into consideration many factors to determine whether an organisation promoted terrorism, or otherwise.</p>
      <p>Last month, police arrested Seremban Jaya assemblyman P. Gunasekaren and Gadek assemblyman G. Saminathan, among others, on suspicion of supporting the LTTE.</p>
      <p>The LTTE was a separatist group that had been active in Sri Lanka until it was officially defeated in 2009. It has been classified as a terrorist group by 32 countries including Malaysia, which did so in 2014.</p>
