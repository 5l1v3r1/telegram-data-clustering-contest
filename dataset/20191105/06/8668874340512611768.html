      <h1>Have the Springboks found the man to replace Rassie Erasmus?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:29:57+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:29</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> are still revelling in their World Cup triumph, in the coming weeks Rassie Erasmus faces yet another gruelling task.</p>
      <p>Erasmus, who was named 2019 World Rugby Coach of the Year, revealed he will step down as head coach following the World Cup.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Erasmus will remain Director of Rugby, while a new ‘head coach’ will be appointed to the team.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old has assured that he will work “very closely with the new head coach”, leaving the question who will be the ideal candidate for the job.</p>
      <p>According to numerous South African media outlets, current defence coach Jacques Nienaber is set to take over the role as the new man in charge.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Aiding the speculation and theory is Erasmus’ close relationship with Nienaber. They have known each other since the 1990s and Nienaber has been Erasmus’ right-hand man at the Free State Cheetahs, Stormers, Munster and now the Springboks.</p>
      <p>Selecting someone inside the camp certainly suits the Director of Rugby’s long-term succession plans, thus Matt Proudfoot (forwards coach) and Mzwandile Stick (backline coach) could also be ideal candidates.</p>

      <p>In terms of outsiders, Johan Ackermann (Gloucester – head coach), Johann van Graan (Munster – head coach) and Heyneke Meyer (Stade Français – head coach) are some of the names that could take over the position.</p>
      <p>Ackermann recently signed a two-year contract extension with the Premiership side Gloucester, so it could be a costly affair to lure the former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> coach back to South Africa.</p>
      <p>While Meyer’s position at Stade Français is under huge threat given the Top14 side’s current form. Meyer has received the backing from the owner and German billionaire Hans-Peter Wild, but local French media are calling for his resignation as the club find themselves at bottom of the Top 14 table.</p>

      <p>Deon Davids is another name than pops up in talks of the new Springboks coach. The former Southern <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/kings">Kings</a> coach is highly-rated by Erasmus and was even invited to ‘job shadow’ the Springboks during the Rugby Championship campaign.</p>
      <p>Despite all the uncertainties, one thing is certain the next coach will have to maintain the Springboks’ current trajectory to greatness.</p>

        <b>Springboks fans were ecstatic after their side’s World Cup final win – but English fans were in a fairly good mood too:</b>
