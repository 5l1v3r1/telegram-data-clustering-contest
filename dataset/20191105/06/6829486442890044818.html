      <h1>Watch This New Zealand Politician Drop A Casual “OK Boomer” While Being Heckled</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:01:02+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Lenton</a></address>
      <p>This might signal the death-knell of the <a href="https://junkee.com/ok-boomer-meme/226785">OK Boomer meme</a>, but it’s still very funny: a New Zealand MP very casually fired back with “OK boomer” while being heckled.</p>
      <p>Chlöe Swarbrick is an MP in the New Zealand Green party, and was just in parliament doing a speech about the Zero Carbon Bill. In extremely OK boomer energy, her speech was interrupted by a National party MP heckling her.</p>
      <p>“The average age of this 52nd Parliament is 49 years old,” she says, holding up her hand and smiling, quickly dropping a “Ok boomer”, and then continuing. It’s a pretty good summary of the meme — a young politician battling for something important like a Zero Carbon Bill, and being extremely exasperated with the boomers impeding her.</p>
      <p>Also, hilariously, the TV captions did not pick up the Gen Z inspired slang, an replaced it with “OK, Berma.”</p>

      <p>Anyway, if you skip to about <a href="https://vimeo.com/371049838">1 minute in</a>, you can watch it in all its glory.</p>
