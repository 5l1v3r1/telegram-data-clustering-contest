      <h1>You might not be allowed to share your Netflix password soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T06:37:31+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 06:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/6748/tech-desk/" target="_blank">Tech Desk</a></address>
      <p>Netflix has become a household name, offering the option to set several profiles so you and your family can stream shows of your own choice simultaneously without any inconvenience.</p>
      <p>However, the company faces a set back with many people sharing their login details allowing different households to use the same account.</p>
      <p>Netflix is working on tackling this issue, speaking at Netflix’s Q3 2019, Greg peter, the company’s product chief announced that the company is working towards solving the password sharing dilemma.</p>
      <p>He did not mention the record of how people share passwords however, he did add that Netflix has 6.77 million paid subscribers during the quarter.</p>
      <p>“Alienating a certain portion of [the] user base,” said Peters.</p>

      <p>We do not know how the company will be stopping the users from sharing passwords however; it could be by limiting the number of IP addresses using each login.</p>
      <p>“We’ll continue to look at the situation and we’ll see those consumer-friendly ways to push on the edge of that,” stated Peter.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve got no big plans at this point in time in terms of doing something different there.”</p>

      <p>Subscribers of the service are able to set up to five user profiles under one account, each user having a separate profile that allows you to select shows of their own choice and resume watching them whenever you wish.</p>
      <p>The streaming service also provides customised recommendations to each user based on the shows they watch.</p>
      <p>At present, there is no way to stop more than one IP address logging in and using another’s profile from a television or computer.</p>
