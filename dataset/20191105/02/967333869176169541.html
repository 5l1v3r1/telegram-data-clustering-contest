      <p>Republican Representative Liz Cheney, the daughter of the former US Vice President Dick Cheney, will introduce a bill that will forbid the Trump administration from extending nuclear waivers to Iran, The Hill reported Monday.</p>
      <p>According to current rules, the White House has the right to issue ‘civil nuclear’ waivers, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911041077224491-iranian-fm-slams-us-sanctions-against-general-staff-as-useless/">allowing foreign companies</a> to conduct non-proliferation work at Iranian nuclear facilities. Cheney’s bill will remove this option.</p>
      <blockquote>"These ‘civil nuclear' waivers legitimize Iran's illicit nuclear infrastructure and help sustain President Obama's disastrous nuclear deal," Cheney <a href="https://freebeacon.com/national-security/rep-cheney-to-introduce-legislation-mandating-full-dismantling-of-iran-nuclear-deal/">said</a> to The Washington Free Beacon, adding that "Congress is determined to support President Donald Trump's rightful exit from that deal and his successful maximum pressure campaign against Tehran.”</blockquote>
      <p>“That is why I will soon be introducing legislation that revokes these exceptions and ensures that the nuclear deal is totally and completely dismantled," she said.</p>
      <p>In 2018, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911041077221359-iran-working-on-centrifuge-prototype-50-times-faster-than-allowed-by-nuclear-deal-official-says/">Trump unilaterally withdrew</a> from the so-called Iranian nuclear deal, signed by the US, Iran, Russia, China, the EU and several European nations.</p>
      <p>Cheney’s bill will be mirrored by additional legislation authored by Senators Ted Cruz and Lindsay Graham, who called the waiver mechanism a “loophole,” according to The Hill.</p>
      <p>Earlier last week, Trump renewed waivers allowing foreign companies to cooperate with Iran on nuclear projects. </p>
      <p>Trump’s nuclear waivers received staunch criticism from “hawks” within Congress, including Cruz and Graham.</p>
      <blockquote>"This is disappointing and another lost opportunity to tear up the catastrophic Obama-Iran nuclear deal once and for all," the two senators said in a joint statement. “President Trump should immediately order his administration to stop issuing civil nuclear waivers.”</blockquote>
      <p>Despite the lawmakers’ initiative, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201911041077222189-conquering-space-iran-to-launch-three-domestically-made-satellites-in-near-future/">waivers in question were already signed</a>, The Hill reports, citing the US State Department. The department has defended the mechanism, saying it allows them to keep an eye on Iran’s nuclear development.</p>
      <blockquote>"This decision will help preserve oversight of Iran's civil nuclear program, reduce proliferation risks, constrain Iran's ability to shorten its ‘breakout time' to a nuclear weapon, and prevent the regime from reconstituting sites for proliferation-sensitive purposes," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed in a statement last week.</blockquote>
