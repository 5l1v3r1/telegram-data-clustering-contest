      <p>BRUSSELS (AP) — A judicial official says former Olympic cycling champion Alexandre Vinokourov and fellow rider Alexandr Kolobnev have been cleared of corruption charges in a suspected case of race-fixing.</p>
      <p>The pair faced up to six months in jail after being accused of fixing the result of the 2010 Liege-Bastogne-Liege race.</p>
      <p>In a message to The Associated Press, Liege prosecutor’s office spokeswoman Catherine Collignon said they were given “the benefit of the doubt.”</p>
      <p>Both riders had denied accusations that Vinokourov paid Kolobnev 150,000 euros to let him win the race. Prosecutors had also requested that Vinokourov pay a fine of 100,000 euros ($110,000), and Kolobnev faced a fine of 50,000 euros ($55,000).</p>
      <p>Vinokourov won the 2006 Spanish Vuelta and four individual stages at the Tour de France between 2003-10. He was given a two-year ban after testing positive for blood doping at the 2007 Tour but came back to win the men’s road race at the 2012 London Olympics.</p>
      <p>He now serves as team manager for Astana, where he spent much of his professional career.</p>
