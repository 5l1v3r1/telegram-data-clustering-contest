      <p>No one wanted any part of a black cat that strolled onto the field at MetLife Stadium during Monday's game between the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>.</p>
      <p>The cat was spotted on the 50-yard line near the end of the second quarter in between plays.</p>
      <p>Play stopped for two minutes as the feline ran toward the endzone using its speed and lateral movement before stopping and crossing the goal line to cheer thousands in attendance.</p>

      <p>It eventually left through a tunnel near the end zone.</p>
      <p>Twitter, of course, chimed in on what was happening.</p>

      <p>Another thought the feline showed promise of a potential NFL career.</p>
      <p>"Quick burst off the line with the acceleration and top end speed it takes to succeed in the NFL. Unbelievable lateral movement. Black cat is expected to go #1 overall in 2020."</p>

      <p>Some used the moment to take shots at the MetLife Stadium's other NFL franchise, the New York Jets.</p>
