      <p>HARNOSAND, Sweden (AP) — The man regarded as the mastermind behind the rise of Swedish soccer team Ostersund was sentenced to three years in prison on Tuesday for serious financial crimes.</p>
      <p>The northern Sweden Angermanland Court said Daniel Kindberg was guilty of funneling millions of kronor in taxpayer money into the club in a scheme that involved two other men and three companies, one being the Ostersund municipality’s housing corporation for which Kindberg was chief executive.</p>
      <p>The two others — Hakan Nilsson and Mikael Carlqvist — were sentenced to jail sentences of 2 years and 2 1/2 years, respectively.</p>
      <p>Deputy prosecutor Peter Jonsson told Swedish broadcaster SVT “the prison sentence was the reasonable penalty.”</p>
      <p>All three were ordered to pay damages to two of the involved companies, including the housing corporation, amounting to about 13 million kronor ($1.4 million) in total. All three pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Kindberg also was banned from doing business for five years.</p>
      <p>During the trial in the town of Harnosand, the prosecution demanded he get four years in jail.</p>

      <p>When Kindberg was club chairman, Ostersund rose from the amateur ranks in 2011 to Sweden’s top league in 2015, and won the Swedish Cup in 2017.</p>
      <p>Ostersund qualified for the Europa League, where it advanced to the knockout stage before losing to Arsenal despite winning the second leg 2-1 at Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>The remote city is 480 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of Stockholm and is better known for its winter sports than its soccer.</p>
