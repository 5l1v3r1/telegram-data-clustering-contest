      <p>Look at her now and watch her go straight to the top of the charts, because <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8542511/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-number-one-hot-100">Selena Gomez earned her first No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> </a>Hot 100 this week. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dC7IDjvaD/">pop superstar posted about the achievement</a> on Instagram on Monday, writing, “I want to thank each and every person that was apart [sic] of this moment that I’ll never forget!”</p>
      <p>After teasing the song's arrival on Instagram for a few weeks, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/selena-gomezs-lose-you-to-love-me-lyrics-say-goodbye-to-justin-bieber-19261251">Gomez released “Lose You to Love Me”</a> and its pared-down and emotional music video on Oct. 23. The following day, she released <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/selena-gomezs-new-song-shows-shes-moving-on-from-the-bieber-drama-video-19266067">another single called “Look At Her Now,”</a> which also arrived with a brand new music video. "Lose You to Love Me" and "Look At Her Now" are expected to be included on her <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/selena-gomezs-new-album-took-4-years-to-perfect-but-she-promised-its-finally-done-17998789">highly anticipated to-be-released third solo album</a>. The release date for the followup to 2015's <i>Revival </i>has yet to be announced, but it sounds like the album drop will happen sooner rather than later. When <i>Entertainment Tonight </i>asked <a href="https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomez-shares-exciting-new-music-update-exclusive-126780">Gomez about the album's status</a> back in June, she replied, "Yes! It’s finally done."</p>
      <p>You don't need to go over either of the songs with a fine-tooth comb to try to piece together who inspired the lyrics; if you look no further than <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/did-selena-gomez-justin-bieber-break-up-rumors-are-swirling-about-these-2-yet-again-8441795">Gomez’s years-long tumultuous relationship with Bieber</a>, you're probably on the right track.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 24, Gomez appeared on <i>On Air with Ryan Seacrest </i>to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1fEfvbILc">talk about both of the personal songs</a> that she just unleashed on the world. Referring to the real-life heartache she drew on when creating the two singles, she said, “In a way, it’s not something negative, it’s actually something positive that I was able to experience that, as beautiful and ugly as it was. I think it’s beautiful that I’ve been able to turn this into a new chapter.”</p>

      <p>This new chapter happens to include Gomez's very first <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 No. 1 song. Yes, until "Lose You to Love Me" showed up, Gomez somehow had not reached the top of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart. "Come &amp; Get It," "Good for You" featuring A$AP Rocky, "The Heart Wants What It Wants," "Same Old Love," "Hands to Myself," <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/selena-gomez-kygos-it-aint-me-lyrics-are-about-a-relationship-breaking-down-listen-38611">and Kygo collaboration "It Ain't Me"</a> all cracked the Top 10, but in a surprising twist, none of these monster singles made it to the No. 1 spot.</p>
      <p>Suffice to say, this accomplishment is long overdue. May "Lose You to Love Me" be the first of many <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 No. 1s by Gomez.</p>
