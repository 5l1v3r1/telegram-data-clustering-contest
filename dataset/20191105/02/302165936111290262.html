      <p>Wall Street shares surged to fresh records, with analysts citing remarks from US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that “phase one” of the trade agreement between Beijing and Washington was on track, and hinting that the US may not impose tariffs on car imports from Europe and Japan.</p>
      <p>The dollar fetched at ¥108.74 (RM4.15) in early Asian trade, against ¥108.58 in New York yesterday.</p>

      <p>Among major shares in Tokyo, automakers were higher, with Honda gaining 2.31 per cent to ¥3,023 and Toyota trading up 1.12 per cent at 7,636. Mazda surged 5.03 per cent after it reported better-than-expected second quarter operating profits.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Group was up 1.83 per cent at ¥4,269 while its mobile unit SoftBank Corp was down 0.19 per cent at ¥1,498.</p>
