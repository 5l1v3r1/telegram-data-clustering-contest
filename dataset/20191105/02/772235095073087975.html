      <p>The <b>Kia Futuron</b> concept has been revealed at the 2019 China International Import Expo, which is currently under way in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>With its long bonnet, swept back windscreen and short overhangs, the design of the Futuron's body wouldn't look out of place on a sports car concept. Except, of course, the Futuron is a coupe crossover which rides on a tall suspension setup.</p>
      <p>The Futuron is one of those concepts that's more about future design themes rather than production intent, with the company saying it is a "strong statement ... for <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/kia/">Kiaâ€™s</a> future cars, which will be confident, sporty and modern, yet also elegant".</p>
      <p>The automaker is especially proud of the Futuron's taut surfacing, ornament-free design and streamlined, flowing design.</p>

      <p>It also has a new take on the company's signature tiger nose grille, which now stretches across the entire front of the vehicle, and a similar interpretation of the grille design could be used on Kia's future EVs.</p>
      <p>The Futuron's grille includes a Star Cloud lighting field with a geometric patchwork of matrix LED modules, which gives the car a unique night-time signature, but is also said to emulate the scales of dragons from Chinese mythology.</p>
      <p>While the concept looks quite compact in these photos, it's actually rather big, as it measures 4850mm long, 1550mm tall and has a 3000mm long wheelbase.</p>
      <p>Kia says the Futuron features four in-wheel electric motors and a high-capacity battery, but hasn't provided any power, torque, performance or range figures.</p>

      <p>The Futuron should have a bright and airy cabin thanks to a diamond-shaped panoramic glasshouse. The car's front seats are made from a flexible materials, which can be configured for an upright driving position or put into a laid back position similar to first- and business-class airplane seats.</p>
      <p>There's also an interactive ambient lighting system with a dragon scale motif built into the door trim, while the ventilation system also features dragon scale-like elements which can be opened and closed.</p>
      <p>Other features of the concept include Level 4 self-driving capability, and an AI-driven user interface system.</p>
