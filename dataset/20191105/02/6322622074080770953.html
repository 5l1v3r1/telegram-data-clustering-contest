      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): The ringgit opened marginally lower against the greenback amid growing optimism that the US and China are closer to a truce in their trade dispute.</p>
      <p>Axi Trader Asia-Pacific market strategist Stephen Innes said there was a significant carry over from last week's performance as both trade optimism and strong the US economic data continued to resonate which saw inflows into the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI.</p>
      <p>At 9.10 am, the ringgit was quoted at 4.1510/1550 against the greenback from 4.1500/1540 at Monday's close.</p>
      <p>He said if the trade talks progress in amicable terms, the Chinese yuan should push lower and as well as to the local currency.</p>
      <p>However, the reference rate for Chinese yuan was very market-friendly as the People's Bank of China (PBoC) broke an almost two months tightly controlled range to the stronger yuan side.</p>
      <p>“Probably they are not opposed to a slightly stronger yuan, hence this is also very supportive for the local note to lengthening its performance,” he said.</p>
      <p>At the opening, the ringgit traded higher against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>It rose against the Singapore dollar to 3.0536/0576 from 3.0571/0612 on Monday and advanced against the Japanese yen to 3.8191/8239 from 3.8288/8335 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Vis-a-vis the euro, the local unit strengthened to 4.6188/6237 from 4.6326/6388 while against the British pound, it improved to 5.3486/3541 from 5.3614/3678 yesterday. - Bernama</p>
