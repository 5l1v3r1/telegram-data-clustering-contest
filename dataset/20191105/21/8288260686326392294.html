      <p>The Chase viewers were left speechless today - after discovering a contestant's real age.</p>
      <p>Those flocking to watch the ITV1 daytime show subsequently took to social media to have their say.</p>
      <p>Twitter and Facebook were awash with comments from baffled fans as the quiz favourite played out.</p>
      <p>The show, presented by Bradley Walsh, a former Coronation Street star, saw four contestants compete for a life-changing sum of money.</p>
      <p>Among them was Owen, from London, who was on the show in a bid to beast Mark Labbett, also known as the Beast.</p>

      <p>Owen from London shocked viewers when he revealed his age.</p>
      <p>The curricular manager told host Bradley Walsh he is 40 years old.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And many viewers took to Twitter to share their amazement, according to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-chase-viewers-stunned-how-17206429">Liverpool Echo</a> .</p>
      <p>Polly said: "Owen looks wonderful for 40!", followed by a heart-eyes emoji.</p>
      <p>Andi tweeted: "Owen's 40 he looks like Guy's older brother by a few years."</p>

      <p>Another viewer wrote: "Owen does not look 40."</p>
      <p>Owen had a great cash-builder round, securing a solid £8000 - however he was not tempted by The Beast's high offer of £35k.</p>
      <p>The head-to-head round was tight, but Owen managed to make it through to the final chase.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, it wasn't meant to be as Mark won the round with three seconds to go.</p>
