      <p>Hey, Upper East Siders who live in L.A.! Vulture here, and in case you hadn’t heard, the CW’s <i>Gossip Girl</i> is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/gossip-girl-reboot-hbo-max.html">being rebooted</a> by the just and loving media gods whom we are all happy to serve (a.k.a. HBO Max). If you know us, you know there is simply no way we could let a Vulture Festival come and go without celebrating this, as this is the show we once declared <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/the-genius-of-gossip-girl.html">genius</a> and also stated, completely calmly, that it is the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/gossip-girl-recaps-your-one-and-only-source.html">Greatest Show of All Time</a>. (It also kind of <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/gossip-girl-college-cheating-scandal.html">predicted the future</a>, so there’s that.) That’s why this <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vulture-festival-la-in-a-very-juicy-conversation-with-gossip-girls-joshua-safran-tickets-80307268201">Sunday, November 10</a>, Vulture’s very own Hunter Harris is sitting down with executive producer and writer of the original series Joshua Safran to take a fond look back at the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/gossip-girl-recap-season-1-episode-10.html">much beloved episode</a> “Hi, Society.” They’ll also talk about Safran’s upcoming musical drama <i>Soundtrack, </i>and of course, we’ll ply him with drinks and demand he tell us what’s to come in this 2020 <i>Gossip Girl</i> reboot. It’ll be fine, don’t worry. Just go ahead and get tickets <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/vulture-festival-la-in-a-very-juicy-conversation-with-gossip-girls-joshua-safran-tickets-80307268201">here</a> or at <a href="https://www.vulturefestival.com/">VultureFestival.com.</a></p>
