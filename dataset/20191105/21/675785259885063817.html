      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:39:35+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:39</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A mum was outraged after a cafe employee branded her two-year-old child "terrifying" in a nasty note on their receipt.   </p>
      <p>Kimberly Sze slammed Coffee Supreme in Christchurch, New Zealand, as "disrespectful" after the worker wrote “Fam w [sic] terrifying kid” on the receipt on Friday.</p>
      <p>“My daughter is nothing but polite and friendly and we’ve never left a mess,” the parent wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>“She’s never been a terror, never had a meltdown, never caused any problems and the same people working today always comment on how cute and sweet she is, so what the actual f? [sic]”</p>
      <p>Now Kimberly vows never to return to the establishment, of which she previously was a regular.</p>
      <p>And other parents shared her disgust online.</p>

      <p>“Not only is that rude to but totally inappropriate way of identifying customers [sic],” someone posted on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Despite Kimberly's disappointment with the front-of-house staff's handling of the situation, she said Supreme Coffee's management had "apologised profusely" after she contacted them.</p>
      <p>"Supreme has been really great in their response and swift in action to address the issue," the mum told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7645627/Christchurch-mum-outraged-cafe-waiter-writes-message-calling-kid-terrifying-receipt.html">Daily Mail Australia</a> .</p>
      <p>The mum was given a full refund.</p>
      <p>In a Facebook post on Sunday, the franchise said: "We made a mistake over the weekend and offended a customer - a young family out trying to enjoy a moment of normality.</p>
      <p>"We are incredibly sorry and wish to apologise publically.</p>
      <p>"If you’re the parent of young children, we know how it is and would like to shout you and your wee one a coffee and fluffy at Customs or Coffee Supreme Welles Street - they’re on us from tomorrow through to the end of Sunday. We love fluffies too."</p>
