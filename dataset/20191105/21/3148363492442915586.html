      <p>“Thanks for the shout out, Debra Messing, Woody Harrelson, Ben Stiller, and Michael Moore! #Hardball20” <a href="https://twitter.com/hardball/status/1191516402550812673?s=20">read</a> the Twitter account for <i>Hardball</i> on Monday, alongside a montage video of various celebrities congratulating Matthews for his show reaching its 20-year anniversary.</p>
      <p>“Chris, twenty years? I’ve been watching you for twenty years,” noted actress Debra Messing in the celebrity compilation video.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Chris, it’s Ben Stiller, and I just wanted to say I really love your show. I’m a huge fan. Happy 20th anniversary,” said Ben Stiller.</p>
      <p>“Chris, congratulations,” added Woody Harrelson. “Warm greetings to you from Bangkok, at 3:30 in the morning. Twenty years, man, that’s awesome.”</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to say congratulations to Chris Matthews, from one Irish Catholic to another,” said far-left documentary filmmaker Michael Moore. “Only one of us is getting into heaven, and I think you know who that is. Ha.”</p>
      <p>Last week, on a broadcast of <i><a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/11/01/msnbcs-matthews-obama-was-so-perfect-that-it-drove-people-crazy-who-do-not-like-successful-minorities/">Hardball</a>,</i> Matthews told former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice that former President Obama was so “perfect” that it drove people who do not like successful minorities “crazy.”</p>
      <p>“Barack Obama was just a sterling character, his family was such a sterling, perfect family,” insisted Matthews. “They are perfect by any standards of traditional American values. They obeyed all the rules. They weren’t money grubbers.”</p>
      <p>“And it drives some people who don’t like the success of anybody that was a minority crazy,” said Matthews, who went on to entertain the bizarre notion that this assessment demonstrated one of the reasons why Donald Trump won the 2016 election.</p>
