      <h1><i>The FADER</i> Parts Ways With Head of Content After Internal Investigation</h1>
      <h2>Eric Sundermann, previously the Editor-in-Chief at Noisey, joined the publication in December 2018</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:36:40+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://pitchfork.com/staff/matthew-strauss/" target="_blank">Matthew Strauss</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, November 4, <i>The FADER</i> parted ways with its Head of Content, Eric Sundermann, a spokesperson for the publication has confirmed to Pitchfork. The decision comes just days after after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against Sundermann on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“Eric Sundermann’s employment with <i>The FADER</i> was terminated yesterday following a prompt internal investigation into allegations that senior executives were made aware of over the weekend,” the spokesperson for the Fader said in a statement. The spokesperson offered no comment when asked by Pitchfork if the tweets prompted the investigation.</p>
      <p>In September, <i>The FADER</i> celebrated its <a href="https://www.thefader.com/magazine/118">20th anniversary with special issues</a> and <a href="https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/19/the-fader-20th-anniversary-vinyl-compilation-playlist">a vinyl record</a>. Sundermann <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8487597/eric-sundermann-fader-head-of-content">joined</a> <i>The FADER</i> in December 2018, soon after the publication let go of several staff members including the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine. The role of Editor-in-Chief has not been replaced since Sundermann’s appointment as Head of Content. He was previously the Editor-in-Chief at Noisey.</p>
      <p>Pitchfork has reached out to Eric Sundermann and <i>The FADER</i>’s president and publisher Andy Cohn for further comment.</p>
