      <p>New V-Strom’s engine produces more power and is compliant with Euro5 and BS6 emission norms.</p>
      <p>Suzuki has taken the wraps off the 2020 Suzuki V-Strom 1050 and V-Strom 1050 XT at the EICMA 2019 show in Milan. The new V-Strom 1050 replaces the ageing V-Strom 1000 as the flagship Suzuki adventure motorcycle with the styling inspired by Suzuki’s yesteryear stars – the DR-Z and DR Big motorcycles – both dubbed the ‘Desert Express’. The styling is refreshingly new for Suzuki’s top-of-the-line ADV motorcycle – and it was necessary, considering the ageing design of the previous-gen bike. The vertical halogen headlamp on the older V-Strom 1000 is gone and in place of it is a single, square-shaped LED headlamp, split in the middle to segregate the low and high beam. Below the headlamp is a new beak, which is flatter and wider than the pointy one seen on the last-generation model. A height-adjustable screen sits above the headlamp while the turn indicators on the XT version are sleek LED units, whereas the base variant has standard indicators with halogen bulbs.</p>
      <p>The side profile of the adventure tourer reveals the new fuel tank with pretty large tank extensions that seem to stretch all the way down to double as a radiator shroud. Below this is a comprehensive, tubular engine guard (only on the XT variant – the off-road-focused, higher-spec version of the two). The tail section has also been completely redesigned. The body panels are sleeker, with new grab rails on either end and a new, clear-lens LED tail lamp. There’s a provision to attach panniers too. The split seats are new; and are flatter than the single-piece unit on its predecessor.  The standard V-Strom 1050 gets alloy wheels while the XT rides on tubeless, DID aluminium wire-spoke wheels, given its off-road bias. Wheels comprise 19-inchers at the front and 17-inchers at the rear.</p>
      <p>In all, the V-Strom’s design is reminiscent of motorcycles from the Suzuki DR series and Suzuki motocross machines, which is evident from the squarish body panels and colour schemes.</p>
      <p>Nestled within the twin-spar aluminium frame is Euro 5/BS6-compliant, 1,037cc, liquid-cooled engine that produces 107hp (7 per cent more than the previous model) and 100Nm of torque. It’s mated to a 6-speed gearbox with a slipper clutch as standard. Suzuki claims the engine has the same torquey nature and linear power delivery as the previous motorcycle. This has been achieved by using a new intake and exhaust cams that have a longer lift duration and less overlap. Suzuki has also optimised the engine cooling system by employing a new radiator and oil cooler. The former increases cooling capacity by 15 percent.</p>
      <p>Suzuki has also equipped the V-Strom with a new IMU-assisted electronic suite called the Suzuki Intelligent Ride System (SIRS). It consists of three power modes, a three-mode traction control system that’s switchable and a lean, sensitive ABS. The XT, additionally gets hill-hold control and cruise control.</p>
      <p>Both bikes get 43mm, fully adjustable KYB forks, as well as a preload and damping-adjustable monoshock at the rear. Braking duties are handled by twin 310mm discs at the front with Tokico Monobloc calipers.</p>
      <p>Suzuki is expected to launch the new V-Strom 1050 in India sometime next year</p>
