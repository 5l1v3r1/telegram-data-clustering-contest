      <p>Muscat: Omanâ€™s central bank raised OMR41 million by way of allotting treasury bills on Tuesday. The treasury bills are for a maturity period of 28 days, from November 6, 2019, until December 4, 2019.<br/><br/>The average accepted price reached 99.864 for every OMR100, and the minimum accepted price arrived at 99.860 per OMR100. Whereas the average discount rate and the average yield reached 1.77254 per cent and 1.77495 per cent, respectively.<br/><br/>The interest rate on the Repo operations with CBO is 2.271 per cent for the period from November 5, 2019, to November 11, 2019, while the discount rate on the Treasury Bills Discounting Facility with CBO is 3.021 per cent, for the same period.<br/><br/>The treasury bills are short-term highly secured financial instruments issued by the CBO on behalf of the Government, which helps the licensed commercial banks to gainfully invest their surplus funds, with the added advantage of ready liquidity through discounting and repurchase facilities (Repo) offered by the Central Bank.</p>
      <p>Further, treasury bills promote the local money market by creating a benchmark yield curve for short-term interest rates. Also, the Government (MOF) may also resort to this instrument whenever felt necessary for financing its recurrent expenditures.</p>
