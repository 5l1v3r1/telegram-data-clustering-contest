      <h1>Barcelona 0-0 Slavia Prague: The sickness does not improve</h1>
      <h2>Barcelona could not score against their Czech opponents in the 90 minutes</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:58:32+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Ivan San Antonio</a></address>
      <p>It was another disappointing result, if not as painful and damaging as the 3-1 defeat by Levante in La Liga at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde spoke of a reaction but Barcelona offered no such bounce back against Slavia Prague.</p>
      <p>Sure, they should have won. They had chances. Lionel Messi hit the woodwork and was denied by a brilliant Ondrej Kolar save, while Arturo Vidal has a goal ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>But this was not enough. Barcelona should have beaten the Czech minnows convincingly, not shared a nervy draw.</p>
      <p>They stay top of Group F regardless of the result of Inter’s clash at Borussia Dortmund, but that should not offer much consolation when they play like this.</p>
      <p>Solar made a great stop to keep out Gerard Pique’s header too, but the defender struggled and saw his ninth yellow card of the season in the first half.</p>
      <p>Jan Boril struck before half-time for Slavia but it was correctly ruled out for offside, just as Vidal’s goal was after the interval.</p>
      <p>This was the first time Messi has gone two consecutive games without scoring in the Champions League at Camp Nou since April 2015, and that is no coincidence.</p>
      <p>He is not being offered much support by those around him.</p>
      <p>When Ansu Fati replaced the disappointing Ousmane Dembele, he finally did have some service but could not finish from the youngster’s cross.</p>
