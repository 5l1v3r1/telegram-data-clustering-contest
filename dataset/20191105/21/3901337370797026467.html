      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> SuperSport United 0-0 Golden Arrows</p>

      <p>SuperSport United moved up to fourth place, despite playing to a goalless draw with Golden Arrows in the Absa Premiership on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Luke Fleurs, Jamie Webber and Evans Rusike returned for SuperSport, as Neverdie Makhubela replaced Saturday’s match-winner Lindokuhle Mtshali for the visitors.</p>
      <p>SuperSport started strongly with Bradley Grobler firing over the top from Sipho Mbule’s pass, while Webber forced Edmore Sibanda into the evening’s first save in the first ten minutes.</p>
      <p>Rusike failed to hand SuperSport the lead eight minutes later when he shot wide from close-range after playing a one-two with Thamsanqa Gabuza from just inside the 18-yard area. Pressure from the home side upped on the half-hour mark, but Sibanda spared the blushes of Webber following a fast-paced counterattack.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Arrows carved their first opening two minutes later following a stray pass by Dean Furman but Knox Mutizwa fired wide from Divine Lunga’s pass.</p>
      <p>On to the seocnd half, Siyabonga Nhlapo set-up Gabuza in the area on 52 minutes with a telling cross from the right, but the former Orlando Pirates striker headed way off target.</p>
      <p>The visiting side ended strongly when persistence down the byline from Seth Parusnath played in Mutizwa, who shot straight at Ronwen Williams ten minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Williams rescued SuperSport once again with eight minutes remaining when he tipped a low shot from Danny Venter onto the post, before he deneied Venter three minutes later with another fine save.</p>
      <p>In the end, that piece of heroics from the Port Elizabeth-born shot-stopper saw the contest end all square.</p>
