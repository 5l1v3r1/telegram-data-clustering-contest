      <h1>Value of MLS franchises continues to grow</h1>

      <p>Not surprisingly, the Atlanta franchise had the top value at $500 million, followed by the LA Galaxy ($480 million), LAFC ($475 million), Seattle ($405 million) and Toronto ($395 million).  Forbes attributes the valuation increase in the MLS franchises largely due to the growth in participation and popularity of the sports and believes that these factors will continue to drive franchise values for the foreseeable future. This is good news for the newest franchises that are about to enter MLS, since they will be paying a franchise fee of $250 million as their initial investment.</p>
      <p>Not all the financial news is rosy, however.  From a profit perspective, the franchises have a long way to go.  In 2018, for example, of the 23 teams in Major League Soccer, just six earned a profit, with three of those teams barely in the black.  And with the current contract with the players union set to expire in January 2020, the owners are believed to have a keen eye on the final negotiations from a financial perspective. </p>
