      <h1>Brit DNA breakthrough will save thousands of kids from killer diseases</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: A new screening for babies is poised to achieve a world first and allow early treatment for life-threatening conditions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:58:24+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bagot, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/Martin_Bagot/</a></address>
      <p>A DNA test for newborns that predicts risk of serious and rare health conditions could save 3,000 kids a year.</p>
      <p>It will allow early treatment to make life-threatening ailments including cystic fibrosis and severe epilepsy less debilitating.</p>
      <p>And it could even stop some conditions taking a grip. If a pilot proves successful, the NHS will roll out the “whole genomic sequencing” scheme nationwide in a world first.</p>
      <p>Tots already helped by the Genomics England project’s work include Owen Everitt, five.</p>
      <p>Professor Mark Caulfield said: “A third of children with a rare disease will die before their fifth birthday. We want to change that and change it for ever.”</p>
      <p>The test pioneered in the UK is poised to achieve a world first in a “mission to do genetics that transforms healthcare”.</p>
      <p>A pilot scheme will give newborns a screening to flag up any risk of serious and rare conditions.</p>

      <p>Early treatment could make them less debilitating or life-threatening – or even prevent them.</p>
      <p>Of the 700,000 babies born in the UK every year, one in 260 will develop a serious rare disease in their first five years that could be tackled.</p>
      <p>The “whole genomic sequencing” test will be given to 20,000 babies to identify conditions “highly likely” to develop before they are five.</p>
      <p>And researchers estimate the process could eventually help 3,000 newborns a year.</p>
      <p>Prof Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England, said: “What we want to show is there is a new opportunity for children in our nation to have something that stops some of the worst diseases."</p>
      <p>The DNA test, costing just under £1,000, will be offered alongside the current heel prick test.</p>
      <p>If successful, the NHS will roll it out in as little as three years in a world-first move.</p>

      <p>The heel prick test can only flag nine conditions, including sickle cell disease. But genome testing will find scores more that can be treated or reversed with “transformative” drugs – or even simple supplements.</p>
      <p>Some forms of epilepsy could be tackled to help prevent permanent brain damage using just a 6p vitamin pill.</p>
      <p>Prof Caulfield said: “A form of epilepsy is responsive to vitamin B6. If I said, ‘Your child could by taking vitamin B6 avoid this problem’, you would probably give it to them. These are the kind of examples. It could alter their life course.”</p>
      <p>Genomics England is a private firm owned by the Government, working with universities and pharma. Boss Chris Wigley said: “There are 3,000 people a year whose lives we could transform.</p>
      <p>“That’s just in early onset cases. Someone may 25 years later develop another problem. We can use the same data to assess [them]. The benefits can play out over the course of someone’s life.”</p>

      <p>Prof Caulfield added: “Our mission is to do genetics that transforms healthcare.”</p>
      <p>The technology was discussed at the Genomics England Research Conference in Westminster this week, where Health Secretary Matt Hancock said we are the “cusp of a healthcare revolution”.</p>
      <p>Owen Everitt’s life was transformed by the whole genome test.</p>
      <p>The five-year-old had spent years having tests and procedures to understand why he was not growing and was unable to walk or talk properly.</p>
      <p>They included steroid trials, blood transfusions and growth hormone injections. His parents feared that he would be severely disabled and possibly not even see adulthood.</p>
      <p>Mum Sarah said: “At six months he wasn’t sitting up and then he wasn’t even beginning to babble or talk. That’s when I had real concerns.”</p>

      <p>Dad Robert said: “He had a lot of appointments and some were quite invasive. We were told sometimes people just never get a diagnosis.”</p>
      <p>Medics had no idea what was causing Owen’s poor development and by four and a half he struggled to walk unaided and could say just 20 to 30 words.</p>
      <p>He joined the 100,000 Genomes project, which sequenced his entire genome and found he had trouble processing thyroid hormones.</p>
      <p>The DNA test discovered a mutation in the THRA gene – which has only been successfully diagnosed in 30 people worldwide.</p>
      <p>Owen was given a thyroid hormone tablet called thyroxine, which he takes daily, and his condition has improved dramatically. His walking and coordination is better, he has grown significantly and he has more energy.</p>
      <p>Sarah said: “This was transformational. You put your life on hold. You think, ‘What’s going on with my child?’ and you have no answers.</p>
      <p>“When we did get some answers it was amazing. I just want Owen to have a full and fulfilling life. He has the best chance now.”</p>
