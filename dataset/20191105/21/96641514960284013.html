      <h1>'Minecraft Earth' early access comes to the UK and 8 other countries</h1>
      <h2>Americans still have to sit tight.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T21:01:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/28/minecraft-earth-launch-october/"><i>Minecraft Earth</i>'s early access release</a> is finally rolling out to countries around the world, although it's not necessarily available where you might expect it. Mojang and Microsoft have <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-earth-early-access">confirmed</a> that the augmented reality game is now available on Android and iOS in nine countries. The UK is the most recent addition, but it's also been available for a few days in Australia, Canada, Iceland, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, South Korea and Sweden.</p>
      <p>You've probably noticed that the US and most other countries aren't on that list. You'll have to wait as the developers bring <i>Earth</i> to more countries in the "coming weeks." The creators clearly want to be sure the title is ready for a large-scale launch. As it stands, the early access version isn't a complete reflection of what the game will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/11/stop-saying-minecraft-earth-is-essentially-pokemon-go/">ultimately include</a>. You might be missing out, but your patience might be rewarded with more content in the long run.</p>
