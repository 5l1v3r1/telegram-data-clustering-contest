      <p>Emo kings My Chemical Romance have been locked in to headline the 2020 edition of Download Australia.</p>
      <p>The New Jersey natives <a href="https://junkee.com/my-chemical-romance-reunion/226887">announced just last Friday</a> that they’ll be reuniting at a show in Los Angeles in December — as of yet, their two Download Australia dates are the only other performances they have lined up. They were last in the country to headline Big Day Out in 2012; they split in 2013.</p>

      <p>They’ll be joined at Download by Deftones — who are gearing up to release a new album in 2020 — and fellow emo outfit Jimmy Eat World, who were last here in 2017. There’ll also be sets from Clutch, Ministry, In Flames, Testament, and Scottish outfit Alestorm.</p>
      <p>On the local side, Hands Like Houses will be stepping up, as will Byron Bay metalcore dons In Hearts Wake, Melbourne’s Ne Obliviscaris, and veterans Bodyjar. Check out the line-up below — this is only the first announce, so expect plenty more acts to be added before long.</p>
      <p>Download will land at Melbourne’s Showgrounds on March 20 and Sydney’s Parramatta Park on March 21. If you’re a previous Download punter, you’ll be able to buy tickets from Monday November 8, while Moshtix and Ticketmaster pre-sales happen from November 11 — <a href="https://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/download-festival?skin=Download">general tickets</a> will go on sale November 13.</p>
