      <p>Women are better drivers than men and break road laws less often, according to new research.</p>
      <p>The fairer sex may be more likely to fail their test first time but once they're on the road they're better than men.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.confused.com/car-insurance/gender-gap-100-drivers?awc=4445_1572952839_90c3f80a576a0767fb57a78fa170b579&amp;utm_source=affiliatewindow&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=id_dm_aj_1040+quote">Confused.com</a>  found that when it comes to breaking the law on the road men outnumber women almost four to one with less than one per cent of women convicted of careless driving compared to two per cent of men.</p>
      <p>And just 1% have been caught drink-driving compared to 5% of men.</p>
      <p>Of the 600,000 motoring offences committed in England and Wales last year, 79% of them were committed by men.</p>

      <p>According to road safety charity Brake in the UK, 80% of men and 67% of women have a valid driving licence.</p>
      <p>When it comes to the most common offences, men dominate, the research shows.</p>
      <p>There were 1.4 million insurance claims in 2018 and it is men who are twice as likely to make an insurance claim than women are.</p>

      <p>The study found that they are also more likely to be “at fault” than women are when making a claim.</p>
      <p>Historically, women also pay less for their car insurance than men and this is because they are seen to be statistically safer drivers.</p>
