      <p>TAIPEI, Nov 5 — Chou Tien-chen is taking the unusual step of gearing up for the 2020 Olympics without a coach, with his longtime physio and confidante shepherding him towards Tokyo gold.</p>
      <p>The soft-spoken and boyish 29-year-old, known for pointing to heaven to thank God at the end of a match, parted ways with his trainer early this year.</p>
      <p>Since then the world number two has been on a hot streak, winning the men’s singles at July’s Indonesia Open to claim his first title in a Super 1000 level event.</p>
      <p>“I do a lot of homework a coach does before a game and spend more time analysing opponents and what I should do under what circumstances,” he told AFP at a recent practice session in Taipei.</p>
      <p>Cheering him on from the sidelines has been physiotherapist Victoria Kao, who has shouldered some of the traditional roles of a coach by acting as Chou’s mentor, cheerleader and chief critic.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Embrace your dreams’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kao accompanies her charge on and off the court, handing him drinks during match intervals and chaperoning him at charity events.</p>
      <p>She says her main job is to “maintain his health and character” in a training regimen that includes pilates and belly dancing sessions.</p>
      <p>But Kao said she also has a duty to keep Chou grounded in the wake of his recent winning form.</p>
      <p>“I will pour cold water on him and tell him it’s just one victory, it’s over and you need to calm down,” she says.</p>
      <p>“But when there are setbacks I will tell him it’s okay — embrace your dreams and persist — to try to lift him up emotionally.”</p>
      <p>Competing in professional badminton without a personal coach is almost unheard of among top players from the sport’s traditional Asian powerhouses.</p>
      <p>Chou still has access to the Taiwanese coaching team, and regularly consults experts including a retired physics professor on improving his form.</p>
      <p>But his decision to take tactical matters into his own hands, with Kao’s support, has earned him a series of wins on this year’s tour.</p>
      <p>He triumphed at the Thailand Open two weeks after his Jakarta victory and took a record third title at the Taipei Open in September in front of rapturous home crowd.</p>
      <p>It was in Taipei four years ago that Chou saw off Chinese great Lin Dan in the semi-final and established himself as one of the world’s best despite his ultimate loss to Chen Long, who eventually snared Olympic gold at Rio.</p>
      <p>Chou hopes to match Chen’s feat next year in Tokyo but says he faces an uphill battle.</p>
      <p>“There are still a lot of things I need to learn, to improve,” he says. “I can’t stay at where I am now.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘I was proud’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chou credits his current streak to a self-awareness that he lacked when he was younger — something that changed after a health scare in 2013 during a bout of appendicitis.</p>
      <p>He dismissed his stomach pains as an anxiety attack and flew to India for a tournament before he was rushed back to Taiwan for surgery. He was told it nearly developed into a life-threatening peritonitis.</p>
      <p>“I was a relatively proud person and didn’t pay attention to the information other people tried to give me... but I’ve come to realise that I can gain more when I am humble,” he says.</p>
      <p>The sudden death of Korean Olympic medallist Chung Jae-sung last year also prompted a bout of soul-searching.</p>
      <p>Off the court he has devoted himself to charity including work with special needs children and teaching badminton to kids in remote parts of Taiwan.</p>
      <p>“Life is short so I want to do more things, to contribute more,” he said. — AFP</p>
