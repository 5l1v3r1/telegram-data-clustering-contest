      <h1>Jogger survives with shoulder injury after getting hit by wayward car in Indonesia’s Batam (video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T03:51:06+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 03:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>A woman named A Tju, 51, survived a direct collision with a wayward car, driven by a young woman identified by her initials FV, in Batam, Riau Islands on Saturday.</p>
      <p>According to reports, at around 5:30am, A Tju was jogging in the Harbour Bay neighborhood. At the same time, a car driven by FV came in at a high speed from an adjacent road and hit a median strip, which caused it to leap into the air, hitting and knocking down A Tju, before it crashed into a tree.</p>
      <p>A CCTV camera at the neighborhood caught the incident on tape, though we must warn you that the footage may be distressing to some.</p>

      <p>Local police say the car actually belongs to FV’s friend, a 26-year-old woman identified by her initials SL. The two women were driving home after staying at a friend’s place the previous evening, and SL asked FV to drive her car because she was sleepy.</p>
      <p>“The driver wanted to hit brake but she mistakenly pressed the gas pedal, sending it out of control,” Riau Islands Police spokesman Erlangga told reporters yesterday.</p>
      <p>FV was arrested following the incident, though the police have yet to announce specific charges made against her. Under Indonesian law, negligent drivers may be imprisoned for up to five years if their victim suffers heavy injuries, or up to nine months if their victim suffers minor injuries.</p>
      <p>According to the police, A Tju suffered a shoulder injury — the severity of which was not disclosed — and cuts to her face. She was treated at a local hospital before her family transferred her to a hospital in Malaysia.</p>
