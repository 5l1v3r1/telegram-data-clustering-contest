      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Malaysia is looking to locate at least RM18 billion worth of further assets linked to a scandal at state fund 1MDB, and is working with at least five nations to recover the amount, its anti-corruption chief said today.</p>

      <p>“This what we’re working on... to locate, investigate and research where these properties are,” Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Commission, told reporters.</p>
      <p>“As you know it’s not just a one-off transaction, it’s multiple transactions, so we need to work together with the countries to help us.” — Reuters</p>
