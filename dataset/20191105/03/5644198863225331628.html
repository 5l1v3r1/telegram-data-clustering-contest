      <p>Loan officers at U.S. banks reported keeping lending standards for business loans mostly unchanged in the third quarter but they tightened the terms for commercial real estate loans, a Federal Reserve survey showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>WASHINGTON: Loan officers at U.S. banks reported keeping lending standards for business loans mostly unchanged in the third quarter but they tightened the terms for commercial real estate loans, a Federal Reserve survey showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>The officers also said they were seeing weaker demand for business loans from firms but that interest in most commercial real estate loans changed little.</p>

      <p>"Major shares of banks that reported reasons for tightening standards or terms on (business) loans cited a less favorable or more uncertain outlook; a reduced tolerance for risk; and a worsening of industry-specific problems as important reasons," the U.S. central bank said in its quarterly survey.</p>
      <p>U.S. banks previously reported keeping loan standards unchanged for many business loans while tightening commercial real estate loans in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Last week the Fed cut interest rates for the third time this year as insurance against economic headwinds caused by slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade war, but signaled that it was now likely to hold rates steady unless there was a material deterioration in the U.S. economy.</p>
      <p>Banks also reported tightening lending standards for credit card loans while standards for residential real estate loans and auto loans were unchanged, according to the survey.</p>
      <p>The Fed surveyed loan officers at 76 domestic banks and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.</p>
