      <h1>Monaco's Ruben Aguilar kicks VAR monitor after getting ejected from game (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T03:10:44+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 03:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>Monaco’s players were frustrated during Monday’s match against Saint-Etienne, as the team was losing 1-0, and just couldn’t get anything going.</p>
      <p>It appeared the team got a sign of life, though, when Saint-Etienne defender Wesley Fofana was shown a red card for taking down Monaco striker Jean-Kevin Augustin.</p>
      <p>However, the play went to VAR review, and it was determined that Augustin was offside, so the red card was overturned.</p>
      <p>That didn’t go over well with Monaco’s players, and later in the match, Ruben Aguilar destroyed Denis Bouanga. Aguilar was shown a red card, and on the way off the field, he kicked the VAR monitor.</p>
