      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After forming a support base near $180, Ethereum started a steady rise above $182 against the US Dollar. ETH price recovered and broke a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/04/ethereum-eth-consolidating-below-190-bitcoin-holding-9k/">strong resistance</a> near the $185 and $186 levels.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a close above the $185 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. During the rise, there was a break above yesterday’s highlighted bearish trend line with resistance near $182.</p>
      <p>Finally, the price tested the $190 resistance area and it is currently correcting lower. There was a break below the $188 level, plus the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $179 swing low to $189 swing high.</p>
      <p>However, the previous resistance near the $185 area is now acting as a decent support. More importantly, there is a new bullish trend line forming with support near $185 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $179 swing low to $189 swing high is also near the trend line to provide support. The main support is near the $182 level since it coincides with the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>If Ethereum breaks the trend line and trades below $182, it could move back into a bearish zone. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $190 level. If there is a proper break above $190, the price could start an increase towards the main $200 resistance area.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is showing a few positive signs above the $185 support area. Having said that, the path towards the $200 barrier won’t be easy. If the bulls struggle to clear the $190 and $192 resistance levels, there could be a bearish reaction below the $185 support. In the mentioned case, the $182 support holds the key.</p>
