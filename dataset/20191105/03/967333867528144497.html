      <p>The Facebook user called "Tzvika Sabag" has a profile picture depicting a poster reportedly made in 2016 by a student of the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, featuring Netanyahu with a hangman’s noose. According to the Times of Israel, it <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/police-open-investigation-into-facebook-user-threatening-to-kill-netanyahu/">sparked an uproar at the time</a>, with police investigating accusations of incitement, but closing the probe two months later.</p>
      <p>The Israel Police issued later a statement <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201909241076879723-israels-likud-blue-and-white-blocs-meet-hold-talks-to-form-new-government---reports/">saying an investigation into the matter</a> had been opened at the cybercrime unit at the anti-fraud Lahav 433 division, according to the Times of Israel.</p>
      <p>Last year, legislators from the ruling <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910021076940289-fed-up-likud-voters-may-oust-netanyahu-to-avoid-third-israeli-election/">Likud party voiced outrage</a> after slogans slamming Netanyahu, one of which called for his death, were discovered on a sidewalk and on walls of a building in central Tel Aviv, The Times of Israel said.</p>
