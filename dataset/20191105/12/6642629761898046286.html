      <p>On June 5, 2017, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a>, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic and trade relations with Qatar,<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/specialseries/2018/02/qatar-blockade-180212075226584.html"> closing land, air and sea links</a>, as they accused Doha of supporting "terrorism" and their regional rival, Iran. Doha vehemently denies the charges and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty.</p>
      <p>"We've overcome the obstacles of the blockade and we're also closer to achieving Qatar's national vision for the year 2030," the emir said.</p>
      <p>Sheikh Tamim said Qatar has always been ready to resolve differences based on the principles of mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs.</p>
      <h3>Economic achievements</h3>
      <p>On the economic front, the emir said Qatar would post a budget surplus this year, its first in three years, after a deficit a year ago.</p>
      <p>Last year, the oil and gas-rich country had forecast a 4.3bn riyal ($1.1bn) budget surplus in 2019, after an estimated 28.1bn riyal deficit in 2018.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, Qatar's largest commercial bank, Qatar National Bank (QNB), reported that the country's account surplus has widened to 6.4 percent of gross domestic product in the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>In his speech, Sheikh Tamim said the country's currency maintained its value despite various attempts aimed at dismantling it since the start of the Gulf diplomatic crisis.</p>
      <p>The growth witnessed by Qatar's economy at various sectors, including education, health, food and agriculture, following the blockade are part of programmes adopted by the state to diversify its economy.</p>
      <p>"We executed national programmes that enhanced local production," Sheikh Tamim said, referring specifically to the last three years.</p>
      <p>"More importantly, the government sought to rebalance the country's budget, and worked on decreasing public spending while leaving priority projects unaffected," he added.</p>
      <p>"Reports indicate that there is a noticeable improvement in economic diversification and enhancement of the private sector, as well as an enhancement in the agriculture and fishing sectors." </p>
      <p>In his remarks, Sheikh Tamim noted there was more work to be done in order to enhance economic diversification and boost the country's growing private sector.</p>
      <p>Decreasing bureaucratic processes that "hampers progression and development" was also a key goal, he said.</p>
