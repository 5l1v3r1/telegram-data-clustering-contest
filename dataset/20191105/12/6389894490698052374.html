      <p>Wework rival IWG boosted revenue in the third quarter as the flexible office space provider built momentum with its expansion plans and international franchise business. </p>
      <p>IWG reported a 9.4 per cent increase in revenue to £692.3m in the three months to 30 September, driven by the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and US markets. </p>

      <p>During the third quarter the co-working space company added 66 new organic locations to its network with net growth capital investment of £64.4m. </p>
      <p>So far this year IWG has added 180 new locations, and is mulling growing the business through further merger and acquisition deals following its purchase of Clubhouse this year. </p>
      <p>“Where it makes strategic sense, we are ready to use our strong financial position to undertake such activity,” the company said. </p>
      <p>Yesterday, IWG added it had entered into a strategic partnership for a master franchise agreement in Switzerland, bringing the total number of franchise partners to 27 across 22 countries. </p>
      <p>IWG said: “We remain very confident in the structural, long-term growth in the flexible workspace market and IWG’s leading position within it, which we continue to extend. “</p>
      <p>It added: “We believe our transition to a franchising model by partnering with a growing and diverse range of third parties will deliver a quicker and more asset light approach to growth, which benefits all stakeholders.</p>
