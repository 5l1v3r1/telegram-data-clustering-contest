      <p>Labour Party proposals for a four-day week would cost the taxpayer at least £17bn, according to a new report.</p>
      <p>Cutting the working week to 32 hours for public sector employers would result in an expansion of the workforce that could cost the Treasury between £17bn and £45bn, the Centre for Policy Studies has warned.</p>
      <p>Analysis from the centre-right think tank said that the policy would “require significant tax rises or spending cuts, or see productivity gains go towards cutting hours rather than improving public sector performance”.</p>

      <p>“This proposal puts the cart before the horse. We need to raise productivity before we can afford to shorten the working week, not vice versa – and public sector productivity growth over the last couple of decades has been almost static,” said Jethro Elsden, a data analyst at the Centre for Policy Studies.</p>
      <p>Labour’s claims that the costs of a four-day week could be covered by wider productivity increases across the economy is “highly unpersuasive”, the think tank concluded.</p>
      <p>The research, first shown to The Times, found that in the absence of unprecedented productivity gains, the four-day week in the public sector would either mean delivering signifiant cuts to wider government or tax rises – or a lower standard of public services.</p>

      <p>Robert Colvile, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, added: “Even the paper Labour commissioned on this topic accepts that higher productivity can lead to shorter hours, rather than vice versa.</p>
      <p>“And given the terrible productivity record of Britain’s public sector, it is very hard to see how such gains could be made, or why taxpayers should be asked to accept a worse service so that public sector staff can have shorter hours.”</p>
