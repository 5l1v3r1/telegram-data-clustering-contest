      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:23:19+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>A stranded <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/family/">mum</a> watched on in horror as a train with her children onboard pulled away without her.</p>
      <p>Brigitta M got off the train in her pyjamas for some fresh air and the doors suddenly closed before she could get back onboard.</p>
      <p>The mother-of-three from St Poelten, Austria, was travelling on an overnight train with her three children, 11-year-old-twins and a 12-year-old, to Venice in Italy when the train stopped in Pordenone.</p>
      <p>She wanted the family to get some fresh air but disaster struck and the train left without her.</p>
      <p>She said: "My son was feeling sick so we got off for some fresh air and to go to the toilet.</p>

      <p>"Once I had sorted my son and got him back on board, the doors suddenly closed. The train remained for a further five minutes on the platform, but I was not allowed back on.</p>
      <p>"I ran after the train in my pyjamas."</p>
      <p>The woman denies that she was outside having a cigarette break.</p>
      <p>She said: "It was only after the incident and I had been assured the kids were OK, that I lit up a cigarette."</p>

      <p>She called police who contacted the train personnel who managed to locate the children and look after them until they could be reunited with their mother.</p>
      <p>She said: "My kids are well cared for, I try not to let them watch too much TV or play with mobile phones. When possible we always travel by train."</p>
      <p>Brigitta took the next train to Venice where she was reunited with her children who were being looked after by train station staff.</p>
