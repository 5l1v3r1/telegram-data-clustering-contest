        <b>France's Pompidou Centre has inaugurated a riverside branch in Shanghai -  the modern and contemporary art museum's first outpost outside Europe - with works by Picasso and Kandinsky among the pieces on display.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Parisian centre will display its collection in a 25,000-square-metre building on the banks of the Huangpu River that traverses the financial hub of 24 million people.</p>
      <p>Billed as the most important cultural cooperation project between France and China, the museum is owned by <a href="http://westbundshanghai.com/">local developer West Bund</a>, which has a five-year agreement with the <a href="http://www.centrepompidou.fr/en">Pompidou Centre</a>.</p>
      <p>"Long live the friendship of China and France," said French President Emmanuel Macron, who participated in the inauguration after attending an international trade fair hosted by China.</p>
