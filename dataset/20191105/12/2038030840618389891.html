      <p>Cape Town - Filming for <i>The Eternals </i>came to a halt when an unexploded bomb was found near the set in Spain.</p>
      <p>According to reports the cast and crew which includes Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden had to be evacuated and taken to safety in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7649651/Angelina-Jolie-Richard-Madden-evacuated-Eternals-Canary-Island-film-set.html"><b>DailyMail</b></a> reports that the explosive could have been leftover from a Nazi World War II base.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10278659/richard-madden-angelina-jolie-bomb-scare/"><b>The Sun</b></a>, experts were brought in to disarm and remove the bomb.</p>
      <p>A source told the publication: "It was obviously terrifying â€” the bomb could have been there for decades untouched but who knows what might have happened if it was disturbed."</p>
      <p>Cameras started rolling on the Marvel title in England in October.</p>
      <p>It centres on the Eternals, an immortal alien race created by the Celestials, who protect humanity from their evil counterparts, the Deviants.</p>
      <p>Other cast members include Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Lauren Ridloff, Brian Tyree Henry, Salma Hayek and Gemma Chan.</p>
      <p>The film is set to be released in November 2020.</p>
