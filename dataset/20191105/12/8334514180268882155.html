      <p>(Reuters) - Generic drugmaker Mylan NV (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MYL.O">MYL.O</a>) said on Tuesday reevaluation of its portfolio of medicines will continue next year and cautioned of a hit to revenue, and its shares nearly 6%.</p>

      <p>Mylan, which posted higher-than-expected third-quarter profit with the help of cost constraints, said it would reassess products it sells outside United States and had nearly completed its review of U.S. products.</p>
      <p>The review process should not affect net profit, President Rajiv Malik said on a conference call with analysts. However, “it does have an impact in our top line results.”</p>
      <p>Mylan in July agreed to merge with Pfizer Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PFE.N">PFE.N</a>) Upjohn unit that sells off-patent branded drugs. The company will be able to leverage a strong base in Asia through Upjohn, headquartered in China, a prime market for well-known older brands such as Pfizer’s cholesterol drug Lipitor and erectile dysfunction treatment Viagra.</p>
      <p>Mylan provided few new details on the merger plan, but said it still expects the deal to close in the middle of next year.</p>
      <p>“This merger will solve nothing,” said Cowen and Co analyst Ken Cacciatore, adding that the Pfizer deal will not halt the problem of “constant downward deterioration in the base businesses.”</p>
      <p>North America business, which accounts for more than a third of Mylan’s total revenue, has been grappling with intense competition, falling generic drug prices and expenses related to fixing issues at its Morgantown manufacturing plant in West Virginia.</p>
      <p>Newer drugs, including Wixela and Yupelri for respiratory ailments, helped North American sales rise 8% to $1.09 billion, marking the second consecutive quarter of growth after years of decline.</p>
      <p>Mylan warned that 2019 sales from Wixela could fall short of its earlier target.</p>
      <p>“While our launch of Wixela has been very successful, full year sales are anticipated to be a bit short of original expectations as a result of the aggressive (market) share retention actions,” Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Parks said, without elaborating on whether that referred to offering discounts or rebates.</p>
      <p>The company on Tuesday also narrowed its full-year adjusted earnings forecast range to between $4.20 and $4.40 per share, from its prior view of $3.80 to $4.80.</p>
      <p>Excluding items, Mylan earned $1.17 per share in the quarter, beating analysts’ estimates by 4 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Total revenue increased 3.5% to $2.96 billion, missing analysts’ estimates of $3.01 billion, partly hurt by the stronger dollar’s effect on foreign exchange rates.</p>
      <p>Mylan shares were down 5.8% at $18.58.</p>
