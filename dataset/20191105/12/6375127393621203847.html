      <h3>A robbery-holdup suspect involved in illegal drug activities was killed in an encounter with police Monday evening in Caloocan City.</h3>
      <p>Caloocan police chief P/Col. Noel Flores said Eduard Naverte, 39, of Blk 37 Lot 7, Bgy. 12 died on the spot from bullet wounds in the body after engaging policemen in a shootout along Alimasag Alley.</p>
      <p>Col. Flores said that earlier at around 7:30 p.m., Ben-Ar Enriquez, legal age of Phase 8, Bagong Silang was walking along Blk 37, Bgy. 12 when the suspect blocked his path and at gunpoint divested his cellular phone and cash after declaring a holdup.</p>
      <p>Enriquez sought the help of barangay officials who immediately reported the incident to the police.</p>
      <p>Joint elements of Northern Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG), Northern Police District Special Operation Unit (DSOU) and Caloocan Police Community Precinct (PCP) 2 immediately conducted a follow-up operation together with the victim until they spotted the suspect along Alimasag Alley.</p>
      <p>When the suspect sensed the presence of policemen, he pulled out his cal. 9mm machine pistol and fired towards the direction of lawmen while running away to escape.</p>
