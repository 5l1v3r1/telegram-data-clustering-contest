      <p>Cape Town - <b>Temba Bavuma</b> will captain the <b>Jozi Stars</b> in the upcoming <b>2019 Mzansi Super League</b>, the franchise has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old was recently given the vice-captaincy in the Proteas Test side before they were hammered 3-0 in their series away in India. </p>
      <p>Bavuma is also understood to be on the verge of a push in the Proteas' limited overs sides and he was a part of the side that played two T20Is in India in September. </p>
      <p>He will now be looking to make a statement in this year's MSL as the Stars look to defend the title they won in the first edition of the MSL last year. </p>
      <p>The Stars will host the Cape Town Blitz, captained by Quinton de Kock, in the first match of the 2019 competition this Friday. </p>
      <p>All matches will be televised on SABC 3.</p>
