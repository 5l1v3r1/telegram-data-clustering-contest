      <p>An ambitious project which would see an A82 relief road in Dumbarton and the overhaul of an old oil terminal is facing another delay.</p>
      <p>We reported in September how landowners of the Bowling site, Esso, hadn’t concluded its procurement approach.</p>

      <p>And an update on the City Deal project provided to West Dunbartonshire councillors last week highlighted that it is likely the outline business case will not be delivered on time, meaning the 2025 deadline for delivery of the project is in jeopardy.</p>
      <p>As at the end of September, the total expenditure on the project had been £1.477million according to the report which reads: “Spend continues to be minimised to avoid irrecoverable costs should the project not proceed in its current form.”</p>

      <p>Esso is currently in the process of remediating the 63-hectare site in the hope it will eventually be sold to the local authority.</p>
      <p>The wider proposal, which is part of the City Deal project, involves a massive overhaul of the former Bowling Fuel Distribution Terminal.</p>
