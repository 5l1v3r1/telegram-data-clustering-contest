      <p>A chef who left a colleague with horrific internal injuries after piercing his backside with a broom in a workplace prank gone wrong has been spared jail.</p>
      <p>Gary Trice, 29, was employed at the Rainforest Adventure Softplay in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> , Lanarkshire, when he attempted to copy a stunt he had watched on a Facebook page called 'On The Tools'.</p>
      <p>He placed the handle of a brush under kitchen porter Lewis Mitchell after asking him to fetch cupcake holders from the top of a fridge.</p>
      <p>But when the 21-year-old lost his grip on the fridge he crashed into the broom handle which pierced his anus, went through the intestines and stopped just short of his stomach.</p>

      <p>He was rushed to hospital and given emergency <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">treatment</a> where the full extent of his agonising injuries were uncovered.</p>
      <p>The kitchen porter, who was unable to begin his second year at university as a result of the incident, later sued the softplay owners and was awarded a six-figure sum at the Court of Session.</p>
      <p>Trice, of Paisley, appeared at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hamilton-sheriff-court">Hamilton Sheriff Court</a> where he admitted culpable and reckless conduct in February 2016.</p>
      <p>He has been ordered to complete 220 hours of unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Vish Kathuria said: "On the day in question, it was 5pm and the centre was getting busy with customers and the complainer was asked to take a new employee into the kitchen where the accused and another chef were working.</p>
      <p>"At this time the accused approached the complainer and asked him to grab some cup-cake holders from the top of a fridge.</p>
      <p>"The complainer found this request strange but complied and placed two hands on the fridge and pulled himself up.</p>
      <p>"The complainer his hand on top of the fridge and as he was doing so unbeknown to him the accused had placed the handle of a sweeping brush underneath the complainer's bottom in full view of others.</p>
      <p>"The complainer lost his grip and dropped down towards the ground and as a result the brush handle went through his trousers and underwear and penetrated his anus, perforating his intestines and stopping just short of his stomach.</p>
      <p>"He felt excruciating pain travel through him and screamed out as he fell into the arms of the accused and was in such pain that he bit on the accused's shoulder.</p>
      <p>"He immediately made his way to the toilet and observed a significant amount of blood. He was pale and in a lot of distress."</p>
      <p>Neal McShane, defending, said: "He accepts this has been a very reckless act."</p>

      <p>Sheriff David Bicket said: "I appreciate that this was not malicious but it was extremely reckless and had tragic consequences for the person concerned. It was an idiotic piece of behaviour.</p>
      <p>"You have no analogous record and having read the terms of the report, I can deal with this by way of a non-custodial sentence but I should also say it would well merit a custodial sentence in other circumstances.</p>
      <p>"This is a direct alternative to custody and if you don't do it then that will be uppermost in the court's mind."</p>
      <p>Speaking after the case, Mr Mitchell said he had not seen Trice since the horror incident and wanted to 'move on' with his life.</p>
