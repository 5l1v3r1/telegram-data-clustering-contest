      <p>Grant isn't a new presence in Reeves' life though; she's been there for years. And this isn't the first time he held her hand on a red carpet either this year.</p>
      <p>Here, what to know about Reeves' girlfriend.</p>
      <h3>Reeves and Grant have been friends since at least 2011.</h3>
      <p>Their first project together was published then. Grant illustrated Reeves' book <i>Ode to Happiness.</i></p>
      <h3>The two's relationship became romantic earlier this year, and they're ready to be more public about it now.</h3>
      <p>A source told <i>People </i>on November 5 that “Keanu wants to openly share his life with her. He is extremely happy and grateful to have Alex in his life. [They] started dating earlier this year, but have wanted to keep it quiet.”</p>
      <h3>Grant is a 46-year-old artist who has worked with Reeves on multiple projects.</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://people.com/movies/keanu-reeves-friend-alexandra-grant-everything-to-know/">People</a> </i>notes that Grant illustrated two books that Reeves wrote: his 2011 book <i>Ode to Happiness</i> and his 2016 book <i>Shadows. </i>They also founded a publishing company together, X Artists' Books in 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.xartistsbooks.com/about">company's site</a>, "XAB is a small publisher of thoughtful, high-quality, artist-centered books that fit within and between genres.<i> </i>Our books are works of art; portals to imagined worlds; treasured companions; the fabric of a community. We love the same things about our books as we do about our friends: generosity, open-heartedness, intelligence, mystery, style. They bring sustenance and shift realities. They may occasionally break your heart."</p>
      <h3>Grant and Reeves have gone to multiple red carpet events this year.</h3>
      <p>In June, the two attended Saint Laurent's fashion show together, and they held hands(!!):</p>

      <h3>Grant is based in Los Angeles but has lived in four different countries.</h3>
      <p>On <a href="https://alexandragrant.com/about/">her artist site's bio</a>, Grant wrote that her living abroad in Mexico, France, and Spain in her childhood and adolescence has strongly inspired her language-based work. Per her bio, "Some of the basic questions that fuel her practice are: How do the languages we speak and the images we see form how we think and exchange ideas? How can artists and writers work to create and influence culture in an increasingly technology-driven world?"</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.laweekly.com/meet-an-artist-monday-alexandra-grant-2/">LA Weekly</a> in May, of why she lives in that city, "I grew up in part in Mexico City, Washington, DC, and Paris, moving between languages and cultures. Los Angeles felt like home from the moment I first arrived in 1995, especially the diversity of people, idioms, foods, and plants (like jacaranda and bougainvillea). There’s an incredible work ethic here—many people are creative and entrepreneurial. Having friends who are working hard practicing their crafts—whether it’s set design, publishing, or acting—is very inspiring."</p>
