      <p><i>Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers</i> is due in February of next year on PS4 and Switch...<b>in Japan</b>. Yep, despite the west's extreme love for the series it's not seeing a simultaneous release, and might take its sweet time when it comes to a translation.</p>
      <p>For now, we can get a closer look at how the Protagonist (read: the <i>Persona 5</i> hero) plays with a new gameplay clip. Although a lot of that gameplay is filled with cutscenes (it is <i>Persona</i> after all) and platforming, we do get a glimpse at Arsene, which will probably make up a lot of the uniqueness for this subseries (we also get a sneak peek at the RPG systems on top of the hack and slash stuff).</p>
      <p>Although the mere mention of a <i>Musou</i> title is enough to make people yawn, it looks pretty legit when it comes to <i>Persona</i> authenticity. It has anime cutscenes! A kickass soundtrack! It's being co-developed by P-Studio, who handles <i>Persona</i> proper!</p>
