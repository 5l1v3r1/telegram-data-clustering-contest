      <p>(Reuters) - Rafael Nadal has said he will travel to the ATP finals in London after undergoing a scan on an abdominal injury that forced him to retire from last week’s Paris Masters at the semi-final stage.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday I had a scan in Mallorca and despite having a small strain in my right abdominal, I will travel to London,” the world number one said in a statement on his official Twitter account on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“On Thursday or Friday I will start training on my serve and my aim is to be able to play the ATP Finals in London. Thanks for your support.”</p>
      <p>Even though he withdrew from his semi-final tie with Denis Shapovalov, Nadal’s run to the last four in Paris saw him reclaim the number one spot from Novak Djokovic on Monday.</p>
      <p>The ATP finals take place between Nov. 10-17. Nadal has never won the tournament, losing in the final to Roger Federer in 2010 and Djokovic in 2013, when it was known as the ATP World Tour finals.</p>
