      <h1>Brooklyn Nets fans aim 'LeBron' chant at New Orleans Pelicans' Brandon Ingram</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:16:17+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Gaydos</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/brooklyn-nets">Brooklyn Nets</a> fans attempted to rattle <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/new-orleans-pelicans">New Orleans Pelicans</a> forward Brandon Ingram on Monday night during their matchup with chants about his former teammate.</p>
      <p>During the matchup, fans were reportedly yelling “LeBron didn’t want you” while Ingram was shooting free throws. Ingram played with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> last season before the Los Angeles Lakers traded him to the Pelicans in part of a package to land <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/MrMichaelLee/status/1191549491922571264">The Athletic</a>, Ingram hit both free throws and then followed up with a finger-roll layup. To make things more interesting, Ingram finished the game with a career-high 40 points on 17-of-24 shooting.</p>

      <p>However, it was Brooklyn who would get the last laugh in the game.</p>
