      <h1>Beermen try to get back on track</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:42:05+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/arman-carandang" target="_blank">Arman Carandang</a></address>
      <h3>LOSING its last two outings by an average of 17 points, San Miguel Beer certainly needs some fine-tuning to rediscover its winning ways and reach its goal in the 2019 PBA Governors’ Cup.</h3>
      <p>No less than coach Leo Austria made the statement after the Beermen absorbed a 119-127 loss to NorthPort last October 23, and a 99-125 spanking from title contender Meralco four days later.</p>
      <p>“What is lacking in our team, we’re so complacent because of our good start and they thought it’s easy to win,” said Austria, referring to the 4-1 start the Beermen posted in the season-ending conference before things turned bad.</p>
      <p>Austria noted that in their last two outings, the Beermen seemed to be just playing and not competing at all.</p>
      <p>“I told them we should not dwell on the last two championships because a lot of teams right now are playing well and they have very good imports,” added Austria.</p>
      <p>The Beermen are running fifth at 5-3, although they still have good chances of finishing within top 4 – and be rewarded with a twice-to-beat advantage in the next round.</p>
      <p>However, they need no less than a sweep of their last three elimination assignments that include Blackwater today, Rain or Shine on Saturday and Talk ‘N Text on Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>The Beermen try to rebound from back-to-back losses as the play the Elite whose own agenda of cornering their last two outings make them pretty dangerous in the 4:30 p.m. tussle at the Cuneta Astrodome.</p>
      <p>Very seldom in that a team gets handsome chances of completing a grand slam, but San Miguel is close to that, having won the first two gems of the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>However, their goal might hit a snag, especially with the local players not doing well and are too dependent on their import in Dez Wells.</p>
      <p>“Our main concern are the local players,” said Austria. “They should provide help to Dez because for the fact that he scores 56 points, he can do a lot for our team.”</p>
      <p>“But he cannot do it alone; I think we have a problem with the locals because we are relying more on him,” added Austria.</p>
      <p>As for the Elite, they are practically out of the running with their 2-7 slate, that even sweeping their last two outings may not be enough in their cause.</p>
      <p>“Basta we will give our best effort in our last game and then see where it takes us,” said Blackwater coach Aris Dimaunahan.</p>
      <p>Phoenix, another team in the cellar at 2-6 and in danger of getting booted, takes on Magnolia in the main offering at 7 p.m.</p>
