      <h2>The two claim to be running to raise money for a worthy cause</h2>

      <p>A Wishaw charity is urging the public and businesses to be on the look-out for two scammers spotted in the area.</p>
      <p>Angela Cook, from the Les Hoey DreamMaker Foundation, spoke out following online reports of two crooks claiming to be from a well known national charity going around businesses and homes in Wishaw.</p>
      <p>Angela told the Wishaw Press: “They came into the charity’s base and said they were asking us to donate money as both of them were doing a run for the charity.</p>
      <p>“They looked pretty professional with their clipboards but I told them we were a charity, not a business and then they headed off. I didn’t contact police as I wasn’t sure if they were genuine until I saw on social media they had targeted other people.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The comments were that they had been spotted in and around Wishaw.</p>
      <p>“It’s people like that who make others think twice before donating to charity. It’s heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>“The people they are targeting, such as pensioners, will hand over their money as they believe it is going to a registered charity but it is going in someone’s back pocket.”</p>
      <p>The scammers are described as white, aged between 18 and 21, slim build and short. Both are also described as having glasses with long hair.</p>
      <p>One has light brown hair and another has dark brown hair. They are believed to be from the Tollcross area of Glaswgow.</p>
      <p>Angela added: “Looking on social media it does appear they have been spotted across the town which is worrying. I believe they are from Glasgow so what were they doing in Wishaw?</p>
      <p>“I saw a few comments from people saying they had seen them. I even saw a comment from a bus driver saying he had dropped them off. I hope nobody has given them money but I have my doubts.”</p>
