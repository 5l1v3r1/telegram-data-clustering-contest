      <p>A man has had a 12cm-long flesh-eating tapeworm removed from his head which had been slowly eating his brain for the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>Wang Lei first started to feel numbness down his left side in 2007, and has continued to suffer with fail health ever since.</p>
      <p>He has seen multiple specialists and was once treated for a malignant brain tumour, as doctors tried to figure the cause of his issues.</p>
      <p>But the young man's condition continued to worsen and he started to suffer frequent seizures and blackouts, according to local media.</p>
      <p>In 2018, doctors discovered that a tapeworm was living in his brain and they advised the patient to undergo non-surgical treatment as the parasite was considered to be in a risky area to operate on.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, the tapeworm continued to live in Mr Wang's head and he recently underwent an operation at the Guangdong Sanjiu Brain Hospital to remove it.</p>
      <p>Following the two-hour procedure, medics removed a Sparganum mansoni parasite commonly found in the intestines of cats and dogs, but rarely in people, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Doctor Gu told local media: "The surgery was risky.</p>
      <p>"The live tapeworm was moving in his brain and we had to remove all of it otherwise the leftover part could grow again.</p>

      <p>"It is not the only case, our hospital has treated four patients this year.</p>
      <p>"People should be careful when cooking frogs, snails and snakes which need to be cooked thoroughly.</p>
      <p>"Also, do not drink water in the wild unless it has been boiled."</p>
      <p>Mr Wang, from the city of Guangzhou in the south-eastern Chinese, is now recovering from surgery.</p>
