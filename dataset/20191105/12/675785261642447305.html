      <h1>Diego Maradona hits back after daughter claims legend is 'dying from the inside'</h1>
      <h2>Gianinna Maradona sparked fear over the legendary star's health with a post on social media earlier in the week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:58:17+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating, Gerard Couzens</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/diego-maradona">Diego Maradona</a> has denied his daughter's claims that the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/argentina-football-team">Argentina</a> legend is 'dying from the inside', before insisting he will leave his children with nothing.</p>
      <p>Fears were sparked about Maradona's health earlier this week after daughter Gianinna, voiced her concerns about her father's wellbeing.</p>
      <p>The ex-wife of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> forward <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sergio-aguero">Sergio Aguero</a> took to social media to speak about Diego, posting: "He is not dying because his body has decided so, he is getting killed from the inside and does not realise it.</p>
      <p>"I do not believe in the parameters of normal, but that is far from the reality of what he deserves. Pray for him. Please! Thank you!"</p>

      <p>That led to immediate concerns being raised about the health of the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> attacker, who is currently in charge of Gimnasia de la Plata in his homeland.</p>
      <p>However, the 59-year-old has hit back in an astonishing video in which he refutes his Gianinna's claims, before saying he will donate everything he has earned when he does die.</p>

      <p>In the clip that was posted on his official YouTube account, Maradona said: "I want to tell you that I’m not dying at all, that I sleep peacefully because I’m working.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what she meant to say or what she had interpreted.</p>
      <p>"What I do know is that as you get older, people worry more about what you're going to leave behind than what you're doing.</p>
      <p>"I tell you that I'm not going to leave anything behind, that I'm going to donate it.</p>

      <p>"I'm not going to give away everything I earned by running during my life, I'm going to donate it."</p>
      <p>Maradona returned to his homeland earlier this year to take up the manager's job at Gimnasia, agreeing a deal until the end of the season with the Primera Division outfit.</p>
