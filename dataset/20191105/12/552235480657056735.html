      <p>A proud Coatbridge gran has praised her granddaughter for donating three wigs’ worth of hair to the Princess Trust to mark her 60th birthday.</p>
      <p>St Andrew’s High School pupil Suvi Adams chopped off 30-inches of her long locks at the birthday bash with the help of hairdresser Lynn McGowan.</p>
      <p>Gran Geraldine McAlinden said she was delighted with the kind-hearted youngster’s charitable efforts – which has raised around £200 so far.</p>
      <p>However, she said she was happiest with Suvi’s efforts to provide three real-hair wigs for in-need kids.</p>

      <p>Geraldine told the Advertiser: “Suvi was known for having her really long hair and even on the night we were saying to her she doesn’t have to do it; but she wanted to help.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big deal for someone who is in high school to chop their hair right back like that.</p>
      <p>“She really wanted to do it and said it would grow again; it was very brave of her to get it cut right down.</p>
      <p>“It was a really nice birthday surprise for me.”</p>
