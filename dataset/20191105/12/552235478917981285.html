      <p>Adult ticket prices for the Betfred Cup final between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and Celtic will start at £35, the SPFL has announced.</p>
      <p>The first cup final meeting between the two Glasgow giants since 2011 takes place next month after both sides cruised through their semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Celtic despatched Hibs 5-2 on Saturday, before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> 's side eased to a 3-0 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> the following day.</p>
      <p>Adult tickets for the Final will start at £35, with those tickets situated in the West Stand for Rangers supporters and £35 for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>The most expensive adult tickets are for the lower section of the South Stand, priced at £45 each.</p>
      <p>That's a £5 increase on last season's Betfred Cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen, where the most expensive adult ticket was £40 and the cheapest £30.</p>
