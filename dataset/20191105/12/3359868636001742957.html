Now the Trezor environment includes better protection for convenient, secure logins.</p>
      <p>At a time when over 8.5 billion accounts have been compromised for both companies and individuals alike worldwide, SatoshiLabs is taking steps to protect our users by combining the FIDO2 authentication standard with the Trezor Model T, bringing us all one step closer to a passwordless future.</p>
      <p>Pavol “Stick” Rusnak, CTO of SatoshiLabs:</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ve seen lots of password breaches in the past but there is a solution to this problem now. It’s called FIDO2, an authentication standard which allows us to get rid of passwords completely.”</blockquote>
      <p>FIDO2 is an authentication standard that lets you log in to FIDO-compatible online sites and services without potentially exposing your credentials to malicious attack or an unsafe computer.</p>
      <p>Using the <a href="https://trezor.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a87eb6070c965ef1be1b02854&amp;id=1c5fb4ed3f&amp;e=9909b24bd3">Trezor Model T</a>, the first FIDO2 token in the world with a touchscreen display, you’ll be able to conveniently and securely log in without typing in a username or password. Simply confirm the website that you’re signing in to on the screen of the Trezor Model T, and the login credentials stored in the Trezor device will never be exposed.</p>

      <p>The authors of the FIDO2 standard designed it to be used with a hardware token with a display; Trezor Model T is the first and only FIDO2 hardware token in the world that lets you fully identify the authentication request before you approve it, by displaying both the service and the account you are logging in to on its <a href="https://trezor.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=a87eb6070c965ef1be1b02854&amp;id=eb684daeb6&amp;e=9909b24bd3">Trusted Display</a>.</p>
      <p>We saw a gap in the security industry that was being exploited in order to steal billions of passwords, so we combined the secure Trezor environment with the most secure authentication standard to bring our users the perfect blend of security and user-friendliness.</p>
