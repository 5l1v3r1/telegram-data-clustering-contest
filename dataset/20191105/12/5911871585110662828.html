      <h1>Fran – “In My Own Time”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T12:43:46+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 12:43</time> by <a rel="author">James Rettig</a></address>
      <p>Next week, Fran are releasing their debut album, <i>A Private Picture</i>. The Chicago-based project, led by Maria Jacobson, have shared two songs from it so far — “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061447/fran-so-surreal-video/video/">So Surreal</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrG1o68A_DQ">Company</a>” — and today we’re getting a third, “In My Own Time,” which was inspired by the <a href="https://lightintheattic.net/releases/16-in-my-own-time">wonderful Karen Dalton</a> album it shares its name with. “In My Own Time” is patient in how it unfurls, but once it fully gets there it’s beautifully languid, Jacobson backed by a bed of warm coos.</p>
      <p>“It takes each of us exactly as long as it will take each of us to see the truth, to know what we should do. Maybe that’s getting out of a bad relationship or into a good one. We are on our own timeline; no one can make those decisions for us,” Jacobson said in a statement. “The title/lyrics were inspired by the Karen Dalton record of the same name. I like the idea of a woman taking just as long as she needs.”</p>
