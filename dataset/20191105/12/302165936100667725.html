      <p>LONDON, Nov 5 — European and Asian markets extended gains today, after a record lead from Wall Street, as trade optimism gave another lift to sentiment.</p>
      <p>Global bourses had already soared yesterday on expectations that economic superpowers China and the United States were close to a mini trade deal.</p>
      <p>Those gains spilled over into today following a report that President Donald Trump was considering cutting some tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>Markets also banked higher on a reported easing in China’s one-year lending rate, while London advanced after a survey showed Britain’s key services sector had avoided contraction in October.</p>
      <p>“European markets are following Asian stocks higher, as optimism over talks between the US and China continues to boost sentiment,” said IG analyst Joshua Mahony.</p>
      <p>“With the PBoC (People’s Bank of China) deciding to cut the one-year medium-term lending rate in China, it is clear that the bank remains committed to supporting the Chinese economy while negotiators work on removing the current US tariffs.”</p>
      <p>He added: “A cut to the Chinese lending rate has helped improve sentiment as rumours circle that the US could remove ... tariffs.”</p>
      <p>The Financial Times said today that the White House is considering dropping existing tariffs on more than US$100 billion (RM413.1 billion) of imports to seal the deal with China.</p>
      <p>It cited unnamed sources as saying officials were looking at rolling back levies on a range of imports including clothing, appliances, and flatscreen monitors, which have been subject to 15 per cent rates since September 1.</p>
      <p>The US has imposed duties on Chinese goods worth hundreds of billions and the removal of some of these is said to be a key demand of Beijing in any trade agreement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a Bloomberg News article said Chinese officials were looking at locations in the United States where Xi Jinping and Donald Trump could hold a signing ceremony as early as this month.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Tokyo led gainers as it reopened after a long weekend to play catch-up with Monday’s rally.</p>
      <p>The Nikkei ended 1.8 per cent higher, while Shanghai rose 0.5 per cent and Sydney added 0.2 per cent.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong won 0.5 per cent as investors brushed off data showing a key measure of business confidence fell to its lowest level in more than a decade as the city reels from global trade woes and violent protests.</p>
      <p>Last Friday’s forecast-busting US jobs report has meanwhile lifted investor hopes that the US economy — the world’s biggest — is stabilising.</p>
