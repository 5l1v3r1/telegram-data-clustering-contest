      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RafaelNadal">Rafael Nadal</a> is hopeful of being able to compete at the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/atp-finals">ATP Finals</a> in London.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard suffered an abdominal injury at the Paris Masters last week and had to pull out prior to his scheduled semi-final against Denis Shapovalov, prompting concerns he may again miss the season-ending showpiece.</p>
      <p>Writing on Twitter, Nadal said: “Despite having a small strain, I will travel to London. Thursday or Friday I will start serving. The idea is to be able to play the £atpfinals in London.”</p>
      <p>Nadal has pulled out of the ATP Finals four times since it moved to London in 2009 while he withdrew after one round-robin match on his last appearance in 2017.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old regained the world number one ranking for the first time in a year on Monday but has Novak Djokovic breathing down his neck in the race for the year-end top spot.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who has never won the title, would need to reach the final and win all three of his group matches to guarantee staying at number one.</p>
      <p>The draw for the tournament takes place on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
