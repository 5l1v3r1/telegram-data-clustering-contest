      <p>The governor's administration must file its brief with the court by Nov. 13, and the plaintiffs and interveners must file theirs by Nov. 25.</p>
      <p>The SJC transferred the governor's appeal of an Oct. 21 Superior Court order denying a stay and requiring the administration to go through the emergency regulation process to keep its ban on the sale of vaping products in place.</p>
      <p>The governor's appeal had been pending before the Appeals Court. Baker said he imposed the ban -- it was initially a four-month ban but has been whittled down by the courts to three months -- in September to give the federal government time to investigate an outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries around the country, including two deaths and dozens of cases of illness reported in Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>The ban has been challenged as an executive overreach that is causing deep financial harm to small business owners. As part of its regulatory filing, the Baker administration projected that a three-month ban on retail nicotine and marijuana vaping products has the potential to cost private businesses $7 million to $8 million in sales.</p>
      <p>The administration is planning a Nov. 22 public hearing on the ban as it works to comply with a court order that it go through the usual emergency regulation process.</p>
