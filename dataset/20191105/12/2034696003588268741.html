      <p>The new show was unveiled as part of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/marvel-unveils-phase-4-movies-including-thor-black-widow-hawkeye-2531113">Marvel’s phase four plans for the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Disney+ is set to launch in the US next week (November 12), though it’s not certain when a UK launch will arrive. If everything goes to plan, <i>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</i> will come out in 2020.</p>
      <p>The show is being written by Derek Kolstad, creator of <i>John Wick</i>, and he’s spoken a little about what to expect in a new AMA on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“In a post-blip world, while touching upon the darkness of it all, there’s got to be some resilient fun to it,” Kolstad wrote.</p>
      <p>He then confirmed that the show will be<i> </i>“totally” focused on platonic relationships between the titular heroes, saying: “There is an element of <i>Band of Brothers</i> to this by way of <i>Lethal Weapon</i>.”</p>
