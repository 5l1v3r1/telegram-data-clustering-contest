      <p>The school run turned into a morning of tragedy when a 43-year-old man was shot dead outside his child's school in Port Elizabeth on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the man was understood to have been a taxi boss, but his name has not been released yet.</p>
      <p>Naidu said the man's wife had walked their 9-year-old son into school at about 08:00, returning to their vehicle parked outside in Mimosa Road in Fairview. </p>
      <p>"After she returned and got into the Audi Q7, and just before they could drive off, an unknown person approached the vehicle and fired a shot through the driver's side," said Naidu. </p>
