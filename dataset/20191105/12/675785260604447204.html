      <h2>Rough seas saw swimming pool spill over the deck of the Ventura - but passengers enjoying their 'jollies' simply 'lifted their legs' to avoid the water</h2>

      <p>Cruise ship passengers were seen laughing and drinking their pints as the ship rocked violently in the middle of rough sea.</p>
      <p>Marine engineer Calum Lawson, who was working on the P&amp;O Ventura cruise ship, even filmed the moment a swimming pool sent torrent of water across the deck as it sailed between Cherbourg and Southampton on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Children are heard screaming in the background as the water flushed chairs and tables aside.</p>
      <p>But the adults seem unfazed and carry on enjoying their meal and drinking their pints - with some even lifting their legs up as the water flow past.</p>
      <p>Calum, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, shared the clip onto his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> on Sunday, branding the cruise passengers as 'typical Brits'.</p>

      <p>He wrote: "Best part of this video is the amount of typical brits are so un-phased by any danger that occurs because 'they're on their jollies' n nothing can spoil that...b****** ships flooding man."</p>
      <p>A man in a burgundy top said: "That's not a handful of water is it?"</p>
      <p>Another video shows water from the swimming pool spill and surge onto the deck.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The clip has been viewed over 576,000 times in the past few days.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for P&amp;O told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7650639/Cruise-ship-passengers-carry-drinking-eating-torrent-water-surges-feet.html">MailOnline</a>: "Whilst sailing between Cherbourg and Southampton Ventura was required to make a precautionary manoeuvre which caused some pool water to spill over on to the deck.</p>
      <p>"The Captain had anticipated this may happen and guests were advised in advance, pools were then subsequently emptied for safety."</p>
      <p>'Jasewba' said: "It's not flooding. Rough seas and the pool is overlfowing. No need to panic at all."</p>
      <p>'JTW' agreed and guessed it could be 'going over big waves and the ship rocking, spilling the pool water out'.</p>

      <p>However others found the passengers' reaction quite bizarre.</p>
      <p>Love Island star Molly-Mae Hague commented: "People aren't even getting up from their tables. Mad."</p>
      <p>Some said it would be their worst nightmare whilst some said the cruise would be 'another one to tick off the list'.</p>
