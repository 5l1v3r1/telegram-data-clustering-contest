      <p><b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite">Fortnite</a></b> developer Epic Games has placed a lifetime ban on a professional player after he was found to be cheating in a series of videos shared online.</p>
      <p>Jarvis Kaye, known in the Fortnite community as a member of the eSports team FaZe Clan, has shared the news online in a video released to his two million subscribers on YouTube. He notes that the ban has come in response to a series of his own videos in which he uses aimbots, cheating software that improves the accuracy of your shooting in-game.</p>
      <p>In his emotional announcement, Kaye says, "All I was thinking about whilst I was making those videos was just how entertaining and interesting these videos would be for you guys to watch. It didn’t even cross my mind to think that I could be banned for life from Fortnite from those videos". He goes on to explain that he has never used the cheats in a competitive game mode and is left in tears as he highlights the fact that he'll never be able to play Fortnite again.</p>
      <p>Note: The video below contains some bad language.</p>

      <p>Despite his apology to Epic Games in the latter half of the video, and indeed the outcry from his most dedicated followers who have started a '#FreeJarvis' campaign online, Fortnite's terms and conditions are strict on the use of aimbot technologies; all players agree to the risk of having their account deleted for cheating when signing up to play.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/gaming/fortnite-aimbot-cheat-life-ban-jarvis-kaye-faze-clan-a9183891.html">The Independent</a>, Epic Games says, "We have a zero tolerance policy for the usage of cheat software. When people use aimbots or other cheat technologies to gain an unfair advantage, they ruin games for people who are playing fairly".</p>
