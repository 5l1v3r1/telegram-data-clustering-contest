      <p>Coxon explained: “Matt Biffa, who is a music supervisor, contacted me about the show and Jonathan [Entwistle], who co-directed, wanted me to do it. We met and talked about it, and I read the scripts and I sort of bought myself a copy of the comic book. Scripts are interesting to read, they’re not like novels.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I just started making music based on it. We sort of talked about how to approach the music and it was pretty much an organic soundtrack. I listened some of the temporary music that was in it, and I just started writing and writing. I wrote tons of stuff which worked.”</p>
      <p>Stars of the show, Jessica Barden and Alex Lawther have spoken to <i>NME</i> this week about the latest season in a far-reaching interview about season 2, which both have said “isn’t a fan service in any way.” <a href="https://www.nme.com/tv-interviews/the-end-of-the-fucking-world-season-2-alex-lawther-jessica-barden-2563921">You can read the full interview here. </a></p>
      <p><i>The End of the F***ing World</i> season two airs November 4-7 on Channel 4. It comes to Netflix globally on November 5.</p>
