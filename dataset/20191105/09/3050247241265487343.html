      <h1>Coca Cola Using Blockchain for $21-Billion-Per-Year Network</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:33:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Coca Cola’s bottlers are implementing blockchain technology to manage their cross-party transactions.</p>
      <p>A Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coca-cola-bottlers-sap-scaling-up-a-major-blockchain-project-2019-10?r=US&amp;IR=T">report</a> on Nov. 5 revealed that Coke One North America (CONA) — the tech firm that manages IT operations for the soda giant’s bottlers — is using a blockchain solution developed by German software firm SAP to manage its supply chain.</p>
      <h3>Managing 160,000 orders per day</h3>
      <p>As the report notes, CONA manages a platform to oversee multiple franchises that manufacture, bottle and ship nearly 160,000 orders of Coca-Cola products daily. Andrei Semenov, senior manager at CONA, told Business Insider:</p>
      <blockquote>"There are a number of transactions that are cross-companies and multiparty that are inefficient. They go through intermediaries; they are very slow. And we felt that we could improve this and save some money.”</blockquote>
      <p>With blockchain, CONA expects to reduce the duration of order-reconciliation from 50 days to just a few days. An inter-organizational, transparent distributed ledger will give real-time insights into the transactions made by all the different bottlers on the network, which generates over $21 billion in revenue per year.</p>
      <p>Semenov outlined how a decision was reached regarding the extent and nature of the data deemed necessary to share between franchises, explaining that:</p>
      <blockquote>"There was a negotiation and discussion, getting to a consensus of what data we wanted to share. We started with a huge list of data attributes, and we narrowed it down to the list that everybody agreed on." </blockquote>
      <h3>Household names turn to blockchain</h3>
      <p>As reported, retail giant Walmart has long been using <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ibm">IBM</a>’s blockchain technology for a variety of supply chain management applications, most <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-uses-blockchain-tech-to-track-shrimp-supply-chains">recently</a> for its seafood imports from India. </p>
      <p>Having <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-experiments-with-blockchain-to-safely-store-food">began</a> its collaboration with IBM on a blockchain-based system that could identify and flag recalled foods back in 2016, Walmart has since pursued several blockchain-related patents and trials — including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-walmart-wells-fargo-and-other-multi-billion-dollar-giants-use-blockchain-to-check-keep-and-ship-products">tracking meat</a> in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-to-track-delivery-drones-with-blockchain-soon-to-accept-bitcoin">delivery drones</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-is-ready-to-use-blockchain-for-its-live-food-business">live food</a> and patenting <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-to-implement-blockchain-based-delivery-system">smart deliveries</a> in the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/usa">United States</a>. It has also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/walmart-china-will-track-food-in-supply-chain-with-vechains-thor-blockchain">implemented</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/vechain">VeChain</a>’s Thor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/blockchain">blockchain</a> to track food in its supply chain in China. </p>
      <p>This September, multiple international coffee companies <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coffee-industry-taps-ibm-blockchain-solution-to-track-supply-chain">partnered</a> with Farmer Connect to use the IBM Food Trust platform and jointly develop an app that provides consumers with provenance and pricing data about coffee products.</p>
