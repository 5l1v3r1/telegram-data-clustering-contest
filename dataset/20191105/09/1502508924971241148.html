      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:10:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:10</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/samajwadi-party">Samajwadi Party </a>chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/akhilesh-yadav">Akhilesh Yadav </a>on Tuesday trashed allegations that his regime transferred UP power employees' <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/provident-fund">provident fund </a>to scam-hit housing finance company <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhfl">DHFL.</a></p>
      <p>"No EPF money of power employees was transferred to the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhfl">DHFL </a>during the SP regime," the former chief minister asserted at a hurriedly convened press conference here.</p>
      <p>Making a fresh demand for a probe into the issue by a sitting Supreme Court or High Court judge, he also demanded the resignation of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.</p>
      <p>"Adityanath should step down. The CM is so weak that he cannot even ask state Power Minister Shrikant Sharma to resign," Akhilesh said.</p>
      <p>Over Rs 2,600 crore of the state power employees' <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/provident-fund">provident fund </a>was reportedly invested in the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited, prompting the state government to order a CBI probe.</p>
