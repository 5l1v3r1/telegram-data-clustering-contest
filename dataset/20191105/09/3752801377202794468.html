      <p>A 32-year-old woman appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's court on Monday on charges of culpable homicide and failure to report an accident within 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The case against Novelake Lisbet Smith has been postponed to November 11 for a formal bail application, and she has been remanded in custody, said police spokesperson Brigadier Motantsi Makhele.</p>
      <p>Smith handed herself over at Mangaung police station on Monday morning after evading arrest for about a week.</p>
      <p>This follows an incident that happened in the early hours of Sunday, October 27, where a local businessman, Ndleleni Donvulo, was fatally hit by a speeding vehicle outside a pub in Pitso Street, Bochabela location, Mangaung, Bloemfontein. </p>
      <p>The investigation is continuing, Makhele said. </p>
