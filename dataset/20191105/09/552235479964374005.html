      <p>A shop worker has been scarred for life after a vicious thug bit part of his ear off for refusing to sell him booze.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old was set upon by a gang of youths outside Corky’s newsagent, in Paisley’s Broomlands Street.</p>
      <p>The gang were under-age and asked a customer to buy a bottle of vodka for them.</p>
      <p>It is understood the shop assistant will now need reconstructive surgery after being permanently disfigured in the vile attack, which was caught on CCTV.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Horrified shop owner Fauzia Mohammed witnessed the attack and told the Express she felt “physically sick” when she saw her employee’s gruesome injury.</p>
      <p>She revealed that her 20-year-old daughter found the torn-off tip of the ear the next morning after cops struggled to locate it in the dark.</p>
      <p>“The police couldn’t find the top of the ear. My daughter found it curled up in the street outside the shop the next morning and handed it to CID.</p>
      <p>“I’m so shocked by it and feel so sorry for him.</p>
      <p>“I was worried they were going to hit me.</p>
      <p>“It was frightening for the customers. I shouted at them to stop but they wouldn’t listen. He was in a lot of pain and looked so pale. There was a lot of blood.”</p>

      <p>In the sickening video, which has been viewed by the Express, a male youth repeatedly punches the shop assistant as he leaves the shop before a female joins in the attack.</p>
      <p>The fight then goes out of shot and when the group appear back in the frame the shop worker is holding his left ear and is covered in blood.</p>
      <p>Along with a third male, both yobs attack him again as he leans on a car trying to hold himself up.</p>
      <p>They eventually walk off in the direction of Ferguslie but, as the victim makes it back inside the busy shop, the girl returns and spits in his face.</p>
      <p>The victim was rushed to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>He was also bitten to the top of his right arm and suffered bruising.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s attack happened around 8.40pm.</p>

      <p>The male involved is described as 5ft 7ins tall and was wearing dark clothes and possibly gloves.</p>
      <p>The female has shoulder-length dark hair and was also wearing dark clothing.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Bob Bowie, from Paisley CID, said: “This was a vicious and unprovoked attack which has left the victim scarred for life.</p>
      <p>“We are very keen to trace the male who was asked to go into the shop on behalf of the group just prior to the assault taking place.</p>
      <p>“The shop and street would have been busy at the time and we would like to speak to anyone in the area who has not already spoken with officers.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
