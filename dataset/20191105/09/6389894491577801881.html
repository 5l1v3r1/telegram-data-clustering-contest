      <h1>UK services sector flatlines as Brexit uncertainty continues</h1>

      <p>The UK’s enormous services sector stagnated in October, but nonetheless beat the expectations of analysts, who had predicted it would contract for the second straight month.</p>
      <p>The services purchasing managers’ index (PMI), which measures the performance of the sector, came in at 50 last month, data firm IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (Cips) said today.</p>
      <p>A score of 50 indicates no change in services sector output. October’s score is an improvement from the 49.5 seen in September, when the services sector unexpectedly contracted.</p>
      <p>Cips group director Duncan Brock said: “Without any real expectation for significant change in October, the sector stuttered and stalled delivering a lifeless set of results.”</p>
      <p>He added: “New business from domestic and export markets dried up and orders fell for the second month in a row.”</p>
      <p>“The sector’s main difficulties are largely of Brexit’s making and with another deadline comes more indecision and delay,” he said.</p>
