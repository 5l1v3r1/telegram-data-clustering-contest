      <h1>FIFA U17 World Cup: Nigeria, Netherlands battle for quarter final ticket</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:03:15+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/sports/football/361069-fifa-u17-world-cup-nigeria-netherlands-battle-for-quarter-final-ticket.html" target="_blank">Tunde Eludini</a></address>
      <p>The 2019 FIFA U-17 World Cup ongoing in Brazil has entered its knockout phase and Nigeria will be battling it out against Netherlands for a place in the quarter-final.</p>
      <p>The match will be played at midnight Nigerian time.</p>
      <p>While the Golden Eaglets finished as table toppers in Group B, their European opponents qualified as one of the best losers in the preliminary stage.</p>
      <p>Though the first round finish puts Nigeria as the firm favourite for the quarter-final ticket, the susceptible nature of the Golden Eaglets’ defence that has shipped in at least two goals in every match allows for worry.</p>
      <p>Coach Manu Garba’s boys had to come back from behind to win their first two games but they ran out of steam in their last group game; losing 2-1 to Australia.</p>
      <p>The Golden Eaglets captain, Samson Tijani, who scored Nigeria’s first and last goals of a 4-2 victory against Hungary, believes the never-say-die attitude of him and his teammates has propelled them thus far.</p>
      <p>“We don’t relent,” Tijani told <a href="http://FIFA.com/">FIFA.com</a> of his team’s proclivity for late rallies. “We don’t give up easily. We force ourselves to keep pushing until we get the win.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Round of 16 tie, Golden Eaglets coach Manu Garba believes that when it comes to this competition (U-17), Nigeria are special.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Golden Eaglets are the most successful teamp in the world when it comes to this competition; winning an astonishing five titles including the first-ever in 1985.</p>
      <p>“The will to win every game is part of the DNA of every Nigerian team and my team here in Brazil is no exception,” Garba told <a href="http://FIFA.com/">FIFA.com</a></p>
      <p>Now with no margin for errors, Nigeria have their work well cut out as they are drawn against a formidable opponent in the Round of 16.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands lost their first two matches in Brazil by a combined score of 6-1. Down but far from out, the European champions redeemed themselves and avoided an early exit as they pummeled USA 4-0 in their final group fixture to burst through.</p>
      <p>The Dutch will be coming off their best performance of the tournament when the two sides meet on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Nigeria, meanwhile, fell 2-1 to Australia in their Group B closer. The faith of the Golden Eaglets, however, remains unshaken.</p>
      <p>“I know this team and these players possess the effort to keep fighting back, no matter the situation,” said Tijani.</p>
      <p>Both of Nigeria’s last-minute triumphs came at Goiania’s Estadio Olimpico and that is where they would be battling out with the Oranje.</p>
      <p>“We want to bring this World Cup back to Nigeria,” another Eaglet, Ibrahim Said, told fifa.com “I want to make my country proud of the team.”</p>
      <p>If Said’s wishes come true, it will be a sixth title for Nigeria.</p>
