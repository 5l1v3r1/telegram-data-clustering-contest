      <p><a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/thermaltake">Thermaltake</a> continues their endless pursuit of absurdly large PC cases today. It really is nothing new to expect a Thermaltake case to be enormous, as they’ve already really taken the “go big or go home” mantra to heart; they never go home. What’s staggering about this case, however, is the sheer volume of features it has. Honestly, I 100% guarantee we don’t cover them all in this review, there’s just too damn many. That should give you some idea of the scale of the absolute unit that is the <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/level-20">Level 20</a> HT.</p>
      <h3>Thermaltake Level 20 HT</h3>
      <p>The Thermaltake Level 20 HT measures in at 613 x 468 x 503mm. Or 24.13 x 18.43 x 19.8 inches if you so prefer. That’s pretty darn big, and the whole thing stands with the size and shape of a rack mount cabinet. It is a full tower, so as you could expect, it’ll support E-ATX motherboards with ease. GPU, CPU, PSU and other clearances just aren’t going to be an issue either. It has 260mm clearance for the CPU cooler, and there isn’t an air cooler on the market that big. The GPU has 400mm clearance and the PSU 200mm clearance. So, a big PC case has lots of space inside, there’s a shocker!</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>Full-Tower – TO THE MAX</h3>
      <p>Of course, the rediculous hardware support doesn’t stop there with the Level 20 HT. It’s LCS certified, which means the whole thing can be broken down faller than an Ikea bookcase. This makes it extremely modder-friendly. Furthermore, it also means that custom-loop cooling is broadly supported throughout. You’ll find no less than 13 x 120mm fan mounts. However, you can also use an 8 x 140mm + 3 x 120mm configuration. Of course, this all extends to radiator mounts too, with various configurations of (up to) 360mm and 280mm radiators supported throughout.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Steel &amp; Plastic &amp; 4 x Tempered Glass</li>
        <li>Top- front I/O ports with 2 x USB 3.0, 2 USB2.0, 1 x Type-C</li>
        <li>2 preinstalled 140mm standard fans with removable filters</li>
        <li>2 drive bays with modular drive racks design</li>
        <li>LCS &amp; Advance Cable Management</li>
        <li>Available in black or white (snow Edition)</li>
      </ul>

      </figure>
      <h3>Specifications</h3>
      <p>The specifications and hardware support of this case are extensive, so for any further details, please visit the official Thermaltake product page <a href="https://uk.thermaltake.com/">here</a>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/thermaltake-level-20-ht-specifications-816x1024.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Exterior</h3>
      <p>It obviously shares some ideas with the Thermaltake Tower 900 in its forward-facing motherboard layout. However, that’s about where the similarities end. Everything is on show in this case though, with windows just about everywhere they can technically cram one. It really does look like a server rack mount cabinet, but a little more “gamer” rather than utilitarian.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140706.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>A few curved corners here and there go a long way though. This PC case may be bigger than a desktop fridge, but it still manages to look pretty stylish. The tempered glass plays no small part in that (and the 25KG weight). It’s all tinted, it’s all 4mm thick, and it looks fantastic. It is pretty reflective, as you would expect, plus it’s pretty bright in the office today.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140716-880x374.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The frame is a robust steel skeleton, but it’s finished with these matte black trim pieces that make the whole thing flow from one edge to the other. It’s a very sleek looking design, despite the rediculous size of it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140719-880x418.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Tucked into the top left side of the case, you’ll find half of the I/O panel. It had the audio jacks and the main power controls. It’s nice and easy to access, but I love the recessed design, as it means jacks won’t protrude out the immediate side of the case.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140725-880x619.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On the other side, you’ll find five USB ports. There are two USB 3.0, two USB 2.0, and a USB Type-C. Again, it’s recessed, so a typical USB drive will not stick out beyond the side of the case.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_141827-880x528.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>One thing I do love is that they’ve added glass upon the top too. Now it looks closed up pretty tight, but airflow is a bid deal for the Level 20 HT.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140733-880x466.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are large air vents down the sides, with dust/debris filters that can easily be removed. I know they look like thin strips, but keep in mind their length; there’s a lot of surface area here.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140740-880x405.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Below the top glass, you’ll find two 140mm fans pushing air upwards too, ensuring heat doesn’t pool in the top of the system. Also, due to the nature of the layout, this is also technically the “back” of your system. The GPUs, motherboard, etc, all have their backplates facing upwards.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140852-880x521.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The fans are decent too, with a focus on low-noise and high-airflow rather than just being the biggest RGB models they have.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140859-880x590.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s even a PSU bracket here. I say here, it’s here right now, but something we realised quickly about this case is that the design is more than a little modular.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_140903-880x598.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While there’s a window on the top that can be lifted out, there are three more windows around the sides of the case. The left and right are mounted on big hinges. Rather than loads of thumbscrews, there’s a single large thumbscrew. It uses a level lock, so you just turn it like a key to be able to open up the panel. Plus, once open, you can simply lift the glass off the hinges, no tools required at all.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_141821.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Around the back, they opted for a solid panel rather than glass. Perhaps this adds to the overall strength of the case too. I like that it has a backplate though, as it means that I can comfortably push this panel back towards a wall without fear of busting a glass panel. There’s a 240mm dust filter here, with mounts behind it. You’ll notice two cut-outs on the top panel too, which are to allow for cable pass-through to the motherboard, graphics cards, etc.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_141855.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The back panel is held in place with four thumbscrews. You can’t tell, but they’re fitted so that they don’t fall out of their mounts when loosened; a nice touch, as it means I won’t lose them.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_141906-880x845.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s a lot going on underneath too. There are four huge feet with some tough rubber pads to prevent it from scratching your surfaces. At around 25KG (without a PC in it), it’s not going to slide around, that’s for sure. However, it does have good ground clearance, and with two massive dust filters, with fan and radiator mounts, it’ll need it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142312-880x770.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The tool-free antics continue on the front panel too. This one uses a push release button at the top of the panel. Push it in, and it’ll release the glass.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142026-880x572.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It only pops out a little bit, so don’t worry about it taking a trip to the floor when you push the button. You then simply pull it forward and lift the glass right out.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142035-880x579.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Interior</h3>
      <p>The front panel lifts out of the way easily enough, leaving a nice amount of access.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142057.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>However, if you unlock the windows on the sides, they open out on their hinges, then simply lift out of the way, giving you access on three sides!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142108.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s an impressive amount of mounting hardware in here. It’s all removable, movable and modular. Even if you just wanted to strip the thing down to paint it, it’s only a few thumbscrews and you’ll have it all off to the paint booth in no time at all.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142842-880x658.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are two of these water cooling mounts, which are perfect for pumps and reservoirs.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142847-880x558.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Plus a cheeky SSD mount front and centre.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142849-880x602.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s some passive ventilation in the base too, to take advantage of any lower down cool air. There are simple clip-in dust filters too, ensuring the airflow stays nice and clean.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142901-880x567.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Big airflow clearly isn’t an issue, but cable routing hasn’t exactly been left unattended either. There are huge grommets everywhere, and countless little cuts and channels around the edges of panels for everything else.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142907-880x533.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The motherboard tray will handle anything from mini-ITX to E-ATX. Of course, mini-ITX would look ridiculous, but I can tell you, even ATX is going to look small in here. I do like that the standoffs are pre-installed though and that massive CPU cooler mounted cut-out will help a lot too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142913-880x664.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>All of the expansion slots come fitted with reusable metal covers. With this being E-ATX and not just ATX, you get eight expansion slots rather than seven; perfect for multi-GPU configurations with thicker cards!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_142920-880x476.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Hiding directly behind the motherboard, you have what has to be the most cable routing space ever fitted to a case. Plus fan mounts behind that should you need them; although it’ll provide passive airflow for your PSU also.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_143000-880x792.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>On the other side, there’s a massive vertical radiator mount right behind the motherboard. Not much use in an air-cooled build, but for custom loop, it’s golden.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_143027.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are two mounts in the bottom corners too, where you can move the front reservoir/pump mounts to the rear should you desire.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191102_143201-880x481.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Complete System</h3>
      <p>Building a system inside this PC case was both hilarious and exhausting. I know I’ve been banging on about how big it is, but putting some hardware in there really emphasises that fact. It’s almost a practical joke that they only put ONE motherboard mount in there, it could theoretically hold enough systems for a 3 v 3 LAN party; now that would be a fun mod!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123157.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>What I do love is just how much space you get in the bottom. I know I haven’t water-cooled this build. However, my PC building skills or what components I have to hand aren’t what’s up for inspection here. The massive radiator mount is great though. Having a radiator at the very bottom is where the air is coolest, which can help with system performance. There’s not one, but two pump/res mounts here too, meaning you could easily opt for a dual-channel cooling loop too. Oh, and if you zoom in, there’s an SSD mounted in there somewhere.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123204-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There’s a lot of cable routing going on here too. In fact, that’s a lot more than I clearly need. However, this case is all about what could be done with it. Your build may have all kinds of pumps and mods, and having short cable runs is important for a clean build. Either way, there’s no shortage of routing options here.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123217-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I opted to fit a pair of RTX graphics cards. Admittedly, they barely take up any room here, despite being the most powerful consumer cards on the market. On the plus side, they have cable routing right next to each, and another right there for the motherboard 24-pin.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123211-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Because the case has good clearance, airflow to the cards just isn’t an issue here. I would want to put some fans in the bottom of the case if you’re not putting a radiator there though. Mostly just to keep the air moving up and throughout the whole case.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123229-880x660.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While the case is obviously very well set up to handle liquid cooling, I think it makes a superb air-cooled case too. Big space, big airflow, vertical venting so heat can’t build up; it’s perfect.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123239-880x616.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Noctua NH-D15S is one of the best coolers in the world, it’s why we use them on all our test-benches and many of our personal systems. It’s also massive, but that’s not a problem here, clearly. I could stack another half dozen of them around the motherboard without issue.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123251-880x758.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Just like the dual RTX cards, and the massive Noctua cooler, the motherboard used here is also one of the best around. The MSI Z390 motherboard, all some of the best in the world at what they do. They’re big, bulky, heavy-duty components. Yet it looks like I just fit a mini-ITX build inside a super tower; AWESOME!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123258-880x562.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>All that hardware can be seen at the rear mounts, which I remind you are on the top of the case. However, it’s a cool cable tidy system in a way and a unique spin from the usual back panel system.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123316-880x692.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are cable channels on the sides of the case, allowing you to route cables out the top. Plus, there’s a handy PSU cable extender to ensure you can get a clean run from a bulky power cable.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_124118-880x764.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Overall, an ultra-clean and spacious build. The potential to add a LOT more hardware is certainly there. However, it’s also about <i>where </i>you install it. As you can see, the motherboard tray, the cable routing panel below it, the radiator mounts, everything really. All of it is completely and utterly removable. The design of the internal frame means you can rotate, turn and move just about every component. Now, I don’t need to do that, but what if you really need things moving for your mod, or you simply want some hardware on show on one side, but not the other? Well, you certainly have the choice here.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123336.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Remember, this rear panel is a solid metal panel when installed. Of course, right now, you can see there’s a heck of a lot of space back here. You can get more fans, more radiators, and a LOT of cable routing done. There are some 3.5″ trays that face out towards the left side window too.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/20191103_123403.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>They’re tool-free for 3.5″ drives as I said before, and just like everything else, I could move these higher, lower, or just removable them completely as needed.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>The case has no RGB in it at all. However, there’s obviously scope to add some should you desire. I mean, our GPUs and the motherboard have RGB and it shows off really nicely through the glass.</p>

      <p>Of course, this is in a darkened room, and you will also get reflections from the glass in a brighter room.</p>

      <p>But with triple windows on the sides and another on top, you can help but admire your hardware from just about any angle.</p>

      <p>I never knew I wanted a single PC in a case that would suit a home cinema rack-mount or enterprise-class server, but well, Thermaltake made one anyway and I love it.</p>

      <h3>How Much Does it Cost?</h3>
      <p>You would think a giant sever-rack mount style enthusiast monolith like the Level 20 HT would cost an absolutely fortunate, and you would be right. However, not as much as you might think. If you consider that the Level 20 Full Tower is their flagship, that’s £749.99 give or take. This beast is actually their entry-level model (I know right, entry-level and it’s as big as a house) and only costs £199.99. Honestly, I think that’s bloody amazing for the sheer size of it, I’ve seen mid-towers that cost more than that.</p>

        <li>Thermaltake Level 20 HT Black – <a href="https://bit.ly/2NzSs5K">£199.99</a>/<a href="https://amzn.to/2NFuAho">$199.99</a></li>
        <li>Thermaltake Level 20 HT Snow – <a href="https://bit.ly/2CeZcAQ">£199.99</a>/<a href="https://amzn.to/2PKyhoq">$199.99</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Overview</p>
      <p>I’m so conflicted with this case, as for the money, I think it’s an impressive product. This much PC case for £199.99 is bloody incredible. Of course, it’s not exactly meant for the budget market, as saturating this case with hardware would cost a fortune. Custom loop hardware is not cheap, and stacking up a full loop of this size would add up fast. Of course, saving money on the case means you can put more cash into the other hardware. You wouldn’t put a mid-range office rig in it either, there’s just no point. You either go big or go home.</p>
      <h3>Bigger &gt; Big</h3>
      <p>Back to why I’m conflicted. I’m sure some out there will absolutely love what Thermaltake has done here, I’m just not one of them. For me, it’s too big to go anywhere really. Even just reviewing it was a hassle due to the dimensions and weight of it. It wouldn’t look right under my desk, and it certainly wouldn’t fit on the top. You need space, lots of it, to really showcase this properly, so if you have even the slightest concern about placement, it’s not for you. If you’re 100% you have a big plinth to sit it on, go nuts.</p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>Make no mistake, this is a serious case for serious hardware. It has extensive options for both liquid and air-cooled builds. On the plus side, there isn’t a graphics card, AIO, air cooler, or motherboard that I can think of that wouldn’t fit in here. Super thick radiators are obviously not an issue either. I’m sure someone in the comments will find a 3ft long GPU just to prove me wrong.</p>
      <h3>Modder Life!</h3>
      <p>That’s the big money shot with this case. Don’t like how it’s laid out? Change it! Everything is removable, movable or adjustable to some extent. Even if you just want to take out the motherboard tray to give you room to customise your loop. Or remove the bottom of the case to cut at it with a Dremel. Modders are going to rip this thing apart and rebuild it how they see fit, and I suspect that’s the main market for this case. What do you think, too big for you? Or are you finally salivating at finally having something this size this cheap?</p>
      <h3>Should I Buy One?</h3>
      <p>Haha, if you have to ask, then it’s likely you shouldn’t. It’s certainly not a mass-consumer product. This is for a very special extreme end of the market that wants to build something completely outlandish. If that’s you, throw your money at it, because at £199.99, I can see them selling out pretty quick (seriously!). I thought about giving this our Bang for Buck Award, because of the sheer square footage you get for your money. Honestly, I think our Innovation Award is more fitting thanks to the insanely modular design, hardware support, and being able to do it for this price without compromising on quality. Well done Thermaltake! Now… make your next one mATX will ya?!</p>
