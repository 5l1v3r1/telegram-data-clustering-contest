      <p>Radiohead: an enigma wrapped inside a conundrum concealed within a mystery, hiding behind a bloke dancing like a deranged cockerel in heat. Who are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/18/chasing-rainbows-radiohead-emi-guy-hands-terra-firma">Radiohead</a>, and why? For decades the personalities at play within the band have remained unfathomable. But with recent years featuring a run of solo projects from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/09/radiohead-jonny-greenwood-cocaine-hook-me-up-recorder-group-classical-label">Jonny Greenwood</a> (2019’s Volume 1: Partita No 2 in D minor and Volume 2: Industry, Water); Ed O’Brien (2019’s single Santa Teresa); Phil Selway (2014’s Weatherhouse); and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/30/colin-greenwood-radiohead-top-5-independent-venues">Colin Greenwood</a> (nothing, actually), we’re beginning to colour in those formless blanks loitering behind <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/thom-yorke-anima-review">Thom Yorke</a>. Finally, we can answer the question that’s been devouring every Guardian reader’s soul since 1997. Which Radiohead solo member are you?</p>
      <h3>1. As a member of Radiohead, you are famously partial to scratchcards. Finally, one comes in! How do you spend the windfall?</h3>
      <p><b>a) </b>Whack it all behind the bar at a celebratory recital of your latest masterwork Three Matching Moneybags for piano and orchestra.<br/><b>b) </b>More flotation tanks.<br/><b>c) </b>One-on-one career-development training from Phil Collins.<br/><b>d) </b>Have yourself uploaded to the mainframe of the next probe heading for the Saturnian moon of Titan. They’ll finally “get” you there.<br/><b>e) </b>Um, invest it wisely in renewable energy? To be honest, no one knows the first thing about you.</p>
      <h3>2. Your weekly clowning class is cancelled due to all the sides you split last week, leaving you in an event-filled community centre with a couple of hours to kill. Which class do you take?</h3>
      <p><b>a)</b> An amateur recorder group – hope we’re learning a Telemann sonata!<br/><b>b)</b> Drone yoga.<br/><b>c)</b> Assertion therapy.<br/><b>d)</b> Voodoo Trevor’s Shake Out Your Demons primal energy dance lessons.<br/><b>e)</b> Probably something charitable, you look the type.</p>
      <h3>3. The darts has finished early. What do you watch next?</h3>
      <p><b>a)</b> Darren Aronofsky’s Black Swan.<br/><b>b)</b> A 10-hour YouTube compilation of the most surreal bits from In the Night Garden, then just close your eyes and have a Netflix-and-chill of the mind.<br/><b>c)</b> Inside Llewyn Davis. Chokes you up every time.<br/><b>d)</b> Inception, watched on a laptop that contracted the Storm Worm virus in 2006.<br/><b>e)</b> QI repeats on Dave like the rest of us, at a guess.</p>
