      <p>PSG suffered a shock defeat to Stade Rennais in last season's French Cup final, and the proceedings were marred when Neymar was involved in a post-match altercation with a rival supporter.</p>
      <p>After seemingly being taunted by a fan while making his way up some stairs to collect his silver medal, Neymar responded by striking the individual in the face.</p>
      <p>The incident was caught on camera and was referred to French criminal prosecutors, who have now revealed what punishment the Brazil international will face for his actions.</p>

      <p>According to <i>AFP</i>, the prosecution has decided to issue Neymar with a written warning, and have deemed that no further action is warranted in the circumstances.</p>
      <p>The fan's lawyer has since hit out at the decision, claiming that it is unacceptable and justifies the use of violence.</p>
      <p>"It's a justification of violence," lawyer Philippe Ohayon said.</p>
      <p>"If that had been a fan hitting a player, he would have been brought to justice and maybe even received a custodial sentence."</p>

      <p>Neymar served a three-match suspension following the incident, and has since returned to the playing field, although he is currently sidelined by a hamstring injury he sustained on international duty.</p>
