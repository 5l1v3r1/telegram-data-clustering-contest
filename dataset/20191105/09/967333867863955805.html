      <p>Netizens, stop eating Xanax because tech visionary Elon Musk has returned online after a 4-day self-imposed exile. Musk, who <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910311077185369-elon-musk-changes-twitter-name-treelon-pledges-1m-to-tree-planting/">uses his Twitter account</a> to make announcements about and discuss his companies’ projects with social media users and of course post memes, shocked his 29 million army of followers on 1 November, when he praised Reddit and cast doubt on Twitter, announcing he would be going offline.</p>

      <p>​His tweet caused waves of comments from social media users asking what had prompted him to abandon Twitter with other netizens begging him to stay.</p>
      <p>But on 5 November the tech visionary returned online and retweeted a SpaceX video from 3 November showing tests of the company’s upgraded parachute system for its Crew Dragon aircraft. The video demonstrates how Mark 3 systems can safely land aircraft in the event of a parachute failure. This was the 13th successful test in a row. Netizens were overwhelmed with joy after seeing Musk return to the social media platform.</p>
      <h3>Disappearances &amp; Twitter Troubles</h3>
      <p>Incidentally, this is not the first time Musk has “disappeared” from Twitter. In June, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201911031077214501-elon-musk-gets-2-billion-richer-after-teslas-surprise-earnings-report/">the Tesla CEO</a> announced that he had deleted his account although it remained active. In October, Musk tweeted he would go offline for a few days without giving any reason.</p>
      <p>What prompted his November self-imposed exile is still unclear. Musk’s online activity sometimes gets him in big trouble.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201910291077170854-elon-musk-will-appear-in-court-in-defamation-case-against-him/">beef with a British caver over Musk’s concept of a mini-submarine</a> led to a lawsuit, while his tweet in August of 2018 in which he announced plans to take “Tesla private” resulted in the US Securities and Exchange Commission fining the tech visionary and Tesla $20 million each and Musk stepping down as the company’s chairman.</p>
