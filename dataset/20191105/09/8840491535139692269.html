      <p>A VOTE of confidence has been passed in Mayo GAA County Board.</p>
      <p>The endorsement was given by club delegates at last night's behind-closed-doors meeting of the organisation at Elverys MacHale Park in Castlebar.</p>
      <p>The meeting was called to discuss a number of controversial issues raised by the Mayo International GAA Supporters Foundation, headed by millionaire backer Tim O'Leary.</p>
      <p>The foundation is withholding a sum of €250,000 raised for Mayo football in New York last May after citing concerns in relation to governance issues.</p>
      <p>In a statement following the meeting, the board confirmed its stance in refraining from public comment on the matter due to legal reasons.</p>
      <p>The adoption of a vote of confidence in the board strengthens its position in dealing with an issue that has attracted much adverse publicity in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>However, it remains to be seen how a resolution will be found other than the legal route.</p>
