      <h1>Qatar, Turkey to scale up cooperation: Qatar foreign ministry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T09:23:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - Regional allies Qatar and Turkey plan to scale up their cooperation into a "comprehensive strategic partnership", Qatar's foreign ministry said on Tuesday, as Doha deals with a prolonged boycott by fellow Gulf Arab states.</p>
      <p>The decision was taken at a ministerial meeting of the Qatari-Turkish Higher Strategic Committee held in Doha on Monday, the ministry tweeted.</p>
      <p>Ankara threw its support behind Doha after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed all ties with Qatar in mid-2017, accusing it of funding militant groups.</p>
      <p>Doha denies the charges and says the embargo aims to impinge on its sovereignty.</p>
      <p>"We succeeded .... in maintaining the independence of our political decisions and facing attempts to turn us into a vassal state," Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani told the country's advisory Shura Council in a speech on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Turkey and Qatar have both provided support for the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia and its allies regard as an existential threat to their rule and have designated as a terrorist organization.</p>
      <p>When the diplomatic and trade boycott was imposed, Turkey fast-tracked legislation to send additional troops and military hardware to Qatar and provided vital food and water supplies to the tiny but wealthy country.</p>
