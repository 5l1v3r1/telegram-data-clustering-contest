      <p>Gregg Wallace, Monica Galetti, and Marcus Wareing may not be judging the best meringue or tart on <i>MasterChef: The Professionals </i>tonight, but it’ll still hopefully fill the <i>Bake Off-</i>shaped hole in the hearts of UK viewers up until Christmas. It’s been a while since the cooking spin-off has been on screens, so you may have forgotten just what the contestants will be competing towards for the next few weeks. So, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-the-prize-for-celebrity-masterchef-being-crowned-winner-could-be-life-changing-12062390">what’s the prize on <i>MasterChef: The Professionals</i></a>, and what will the cooks need to do to get their hands on it?</p>
      <p>Much like <i>Bake Off</i>, the chefs <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10280811/masterchef-the-professionals-start-contestants-prize/">won’t be receiving a grand sum of money</a> for making their way through the competition. Instead, the winner is “awarded the prestigious title and a snazzy trophy” for impressing the judges over the course of their time in the kitchen, as <i>The Sun </i>writes.</p>
      <p>Looking back at their time on the show is also a prize in itself, seeing as they’d have made their way through weeks of stress and nerves. The difference with the <i>Professionals, </i>though is that the chefs competing will have had plenty of experience in demanding kitchen environments.</p>
      <p>But nevertheless, working your craft in front of three of the world’s best chefs would make anyone anxious. And as <i>The Guardian </i>writes, you also need to take into account that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/nov/22/why-masterchef-the-professionals-is-the-cruellest-reality-tv-show">the chef’s do this for a living</a>. So being told you’re not good enough by the likes of Wallace, Galetti, and Wareing “can do lasting damage”.</p>

      <p>Gracing <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/masterchef-the-professionals-2019-when-start-date-time-bbc-one-cast-contestants-824168">the <i>MasterChef </i>kitchen</a> is 48 chefs who will compete against each other through four weeks of heats, which in turn includes their own quarter-final “in the third programme of each week,” as <i>iNews </i>notes. In brief, these heats are followed by a knockout week, a “pop-up challenge”, the semi-finals, and then the final.</p>
      <p>For this, the three chefs that have made it all the way through the competition make their way to Portugal. Here, they’ll be tasked to cook in a Lisbon restaurant, “where the chefs will cook for a whole restaurant of industry dining people.” After this, they fly back to the UK for one more challenge and then the winner is given their title.</p>
      <p>Not a lot of pressure then, eh?</p>
      <p>MasterChef: The Professionals <i>starts Nov. 5 on BBC Two at 9 p.m.</i></p>
