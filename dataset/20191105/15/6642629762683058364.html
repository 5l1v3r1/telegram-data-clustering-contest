      <p>Workers on the UK's South Western Railway are to strike for 27 days before the end of the year in the long-running dispute over guards on trains.</p>
      <p>Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union will walk out for 27 days between December 2 and New Year's Day, threatening travel chaos for commuters and Christmas shoppers.</p>
      <p>RMT General-Secretary Mick Cash said: "Our members have been left with no choice but to call a further 27 days of strike action on South Western Railway.</p>
      <p>"At the last meeting we held with SWR, principles in agreements were made in good faith with the company's negotiating team and we now feel hugely let down again.</p>
      <p>"As long as the company continues to refuse to give assurances on the future operational role of the guard, we will remain in dispute.</p>
      <p>"I want to congratulate our members on their continued resolve in their fight for safety and the role of the guard on SWR.</p>
      <p>"It is wholly down to the management side that the core issue of the safety-critical competencies and the role of the guard has not been agreed."</p>
      <p>RMT members will not book on for duty from 00:01 GMT on Monday, December 2 until 23:59 GMT on Wednesday, December 11, from 00:01 on Friday, December 13 until 23:59 GMT on Tuesday, December 24, and from 00:01 GMT on Friday, December 27 until 23:59 GMT on January 1.</p>
      <p>The RMT accused the company of "dangling" a potential breakthrough deal in front of the union and then failing to honour it, offering no reasons for the delay.Â </p>
