      <h1>Aston Villa provide fresh Jack Grealish injury update ahead of Wolves showdown</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | Grealish missed Saturday's defeat against Liverpool with a calf injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:43:39+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa are hopeful that Jack Grealish will be fit to face Wolverhampton Wanderers this weekend.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> skipper missed the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-liverpool-live-robertson-17188264">2-1 defeat to Liverpool</a> with a calf injury he picked up in the closing stages against Manchester City 10 days ago.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-grealish-injury-wolves-14251861">He also sat out Villa’s victory against Wolves in the Carabao Cup after the visit to the Etihad</a> – although <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> confirmed he probably wouldn’t have been picked anyway.</p>
      <p>But he’s likely to be involved in Sunday’s West Midlands showdown at Molineux having responded well to treatment. The 24-year-old will return to full training later this week to get back up to speed.</p>

      <p>Smith told <a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/News/2019/11/05/injury-update-grealish-jota-guilbert-chester">avfc.co.uk</a> on Tuesday: “Jack’s calf was just not right at the weekend. Hopefully he will be training on Thursday at the latter part of the week.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/jack-grealish">Grealish</a> has been pushed into a more advanced position in his recent outings and he’s scored twice in his last three games as well as providing the assist for Matt Targett’s late winner against Brighton.</p>
      <p>He could receive his first ever England call-up when the squad is announced later this week and speaking after the Liverpool match, Smith confirmed he has no concerns about his playmaker being selected.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“He's available for selection that's for sure. He'll be fit for the Wolves game, I'm sure he'll be back training. It's a dead calf and after training on Friday it was probably just a day too soon.</p>
      <p>“He trained on Friday and was fine, he was due to start against Liverpool but he felt it tightened up on Saturday morning. He went for a run on the pitch and felt he wasn't 100 per cent.</p>
      <p>“I said we needed to make sure he was 100 per cent because Liverpool are a top team. He held his hands up and said ‘I’m not’”.</p>
