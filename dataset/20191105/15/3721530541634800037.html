      <p>When <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20942406/red-dead-redemption-2-rdr2-pc-impressions"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></a> was released on PC this morning, the game’s modding community immediately got to work. In fact, modders have been at work since before <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>’s launch — before the game’s release, there was already a mod uploaded to <a href="https://www.reddeadmodders.com/">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
      <p>The first mod uploaded is a re-skin of <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> main character Arthur Morgan, turning the cowboy into a clown. The Joker, specifically. With this mod, created by RedDeadModders, Arthur Morgan wears Joker-inspired makeup. Smile! RedDeadModders is also working on a bunch of other mods, too: Arthur as the Terminator, an undead horse, and a knife-gun weapon, among others.</p>
      <p>Another modder also uploaded a “<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/4">photorealistic reshade</a>” for <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>, giving players enhanced colors and shadows.</p>
      <p>It’s not surprising how quickly the modding community’s taken to <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. <i>Grand Theft Auto 5</i> — also by Rockstar Games — has one of the most vibrant modding communities online.</p>

      <p>People have been anticipating <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>’s release on PC since the game’s original launch. When the game was confirmed for PC, a group of modders immediately got to work dreaming up new stuff: the creators of FiveM, a popular <i>Grand Theft Auto 5</i> mod that lets people play on custom servers, announced it was working on a similar framework for <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. However, a release isn’t confirmed: Modders will only be able to do so if Rockstar allows for <i>Red Dead Online </i>mod support, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/01/red-dead-2-on-pc-rockstar-answers-our-pressing-questions">the developer hasn’t confirmed either way</a>.</p>
