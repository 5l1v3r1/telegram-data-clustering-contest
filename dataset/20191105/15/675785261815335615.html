      <h1>Arsenal told to "break the bank" for Brendan Rodgers and "watch him transform the club"</h1>
      <h2>The Gunners come face-to-face with Rodgers' Leicester City on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:09:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal favourite Paul Merson thinks the Gunners should do all they can to bring in Brendan Rodgers ahead of coming face-to-face with the Leicester City manager on Saturday.</p>
      <p>With current boss Unai Emery coming under increasing pressure, the North Londoners head to the King Power Stadium this weekend in what looks to be a key game in the fight for a top four finish.</p>
      <p>A win for the Foxes would take them nine points clear of the Gunners, and Merson believes that it would be a hugely damaging result for Emery.</p>
      <p>"The gap is already six points to fourth and Arsenal are in a situation where they can realistically only afford to lose two more games this season to keep pace with the teams ahead of them," Merson told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15205/11854772/paul-merson-says-liverpool-within-touch-of-premier-league-title">Sky Sports</a> .</p>

      <p>"And, to make matters worse, the fans are turning, they are booing, making decisions and chanting ‘you don’t know what you’re doing’.</p>
      <p>"That’s not good, especially ahead of the two-week international break, a break in which Emery’s position will be under threat if they fall to the Foxes."</p>

      <p>Merson went on to heap more praise on Rodgers, with the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss impressing since his return to the Premier League earlier this year following his successful spell at Celtic.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> have been outstanding. They have an unbelievable manager. Brendan Rodgers has improved every single player at his disposal," continued Merson.</p>

      <p>"He’s getting a tune out of every single player, it’s incredible. If they beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> on Saturday, they will be in the driving seat for the top four.</p>
      <p>"Rodgers has done so well that Leicester have a job on their hands keeping hold of him.</p>
      <p>"If I were Arsenal, I’d be breaking the bank to get him, give him a five-year contract and sit back and watch him transform the club."</p>
