      <h1>Jairzinho Rozenstruik to face Alistair Overeem in UFC on ESPN 7 main event</h1>

      <p>After a quick KO of Andrei Arlovski, Surinamese heavyweight Jairzinho Rozenstruik will take on Alistair Overeem in the main event of UFC on ESPN 7 in Washington DC. Rozenstruik is replacing Walt Harris, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/2/20944046/walt-harris-ufc-washington-main-event-missing-stepdaughter-aniah-blanchard-mma-news?utm_campaign=bloodyelbow&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">who withdrew from the bout</a> as he continues his search for his missing stepdaughter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/bokamotoespn/status/1191505781608218624?s=21">ESPN’s Brett Okamoto</a> reported the news on Monday.</p>
      <p>Rozenstruik (9-0) is a heavy-hitting striker who is 3-0 in the UFC. He made his debut in February, knocking out Junior Albini early in round two. His next two fights have lasted a grand total of 38 seconds; Allen Crowder was done and dusted in nine seconds, while Arlovski was wiped out in 29 seconds last Saturday at UFC 244.</p>
      <p>Speaking with reporters after the Arlovski bout, the 31-year-old expressed his desire to face Overeem on short notice, and he got his wish.</p>
      <p>Overeem (45-17, 1 NC) is on a two-fight win streak, having knocked out Alexey Oleinik at UFC Saint Petersburg in April. He also scored a ground-and-pound TKO over the debuting Sergey Pavlovich last November. Overeem will obviously be cognizant of Rozenstruik’s power, seeing as he’s been knocked out 13 times just in his MMA career.</p>
      <p>UFC on ESPN 7 takes place on Saturday, December 7th. Other notable fights on the card include Carlos Condit vs. Mickey Gall, Rob Font vs. Ricky Simon, and Yana Kunitskaya vs. Aspen Ladd.</p>
