      <p>Out goes Hot Girl Summer, in comes … Pouty Pope Autumn. With HBO’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/the-new-pope-trailer-hbo-jude-law-2019.html"><i>The New Pope</i></a> on its way and this new trailer for Netflix’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/tiff-2019-lineup-the-joker-hustlers-uncut-gems-baumbach-soderbergh-more.html"><i>The Two Popes</i></a>, we’re definitely seeing a lot of white smoke. Everyone’s a pope, including Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce, who portray Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis in this movie “inspired by” real events. When his harshest critic, a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/01/how-is-the-pope-chosen.html">pre-papal</a> Pope Francis, asks to retire, Pope Benedict invites him to the Vatican, so they can exchange snide remarks in person. But might the duo actually get along after all? What it leads to will shape the Catholic Church for years to come. <i>The Two Popes</i>, directed by Academy Award nominee Fernando Meirelles, hits theaters on November 29 and Netflix on December 20. Too pope-y? Try <i>The New Pope</i>’s trailer, which is almost exclusively <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-new-pope-trailer-hbo-jude-law-2019.html">Jude Law in a Speedo</a>. Everyone worships in their own way!</p>
