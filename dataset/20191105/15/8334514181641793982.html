      <p>(Reuters) - Elon Musk has not left Twitter after all.</p>
      <p>Just three days after the billionaire announced that he was going offline, Tesla Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O">TSLA.O</a>) chief executive officer went back on Tuesday with a handful of tweets promoting a successful test by his rocket company, SpaceX.</p>
      <p>"Great work by SpaceX Dragon team &amp; Airborne! To be clear, we’ve only done 1 multi-parachute test of Mk3 design, so 9 more left to reach 10 successful tests in a row," he tweeted. (<a href="http://bit.ly/33iaHDr">bit.ly/33iaHDr</a>)</p>
      <p>Last Friday, Musk tweeted he was going offline, after questioning “the good” of the micro-blogging site.</p>
      <p>Musk has a history of being playful with his Twitter account, one of corporate America’s most-watched.</p>
      <p>In June, he said he had deleted his Twitter account, while also changing his Twitter display name to “Daddy DotCom”.</p>
      <p>Musk has also previously been accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for giving misleading corporate information about Tesla on Twitter.</p>
