      <p>(CNN) - Sandra Bullock will be back on Netflix.</p>
      <p>Following the success of "Bird Box," the actress has signed on to star in a feature film adaptation of "Unforgiven," based on a British three-part series that aired in 2009.</p>
      <p>"Mission: Impossible -- Rogue Nation" director and writer Christopher McQuarrie wrote the script, and German filmmaker Nora Fingscheidt will direct.</p>
      <p>"This one is near and dear to my heart," McQuarrie wrote on Twitter, adding that he's honored to know it's in "such good hands." He added that he'd written a first draft almost a decade ago.</p>
      <p>The show centers around a woman, imprisoned for a violent crime, who attempts to rebuild her life after being released from prison. She faces a society that refuses to let her move forward.</p>
      <p>"Bird Box" was Bullock's first collaboration with Netflix, and that project is currently in sequel development as a book.</p>
      <p>McQuarrie is working on the next two "Mission: Impossible" movies, and is developing Bill Clinton and James Patterson's novel "The President Is Missing" for Showtime.</p>
