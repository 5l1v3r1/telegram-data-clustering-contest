      <p>Missing Pietermaritzburg doctor Vidwan Singh was found dead at Howick Falls on Tuesday, KwaZulu-Natal police said.</p>
      <p>"Yes, that's right, he was found," said police spokesperson, Warrant Officer Joshua Maistry, as word of the sad discovery spread.</p>
      <p>"It is indeed very sad to lose such a person who has been a stalwart in Pietermaritzburg, more so to the Northdale community that knew him very well," he added in a later statement.</p>
      <p>Singh went missing last Tuesday, with <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/frantic-search-for-doctor-20191030"><b>The Witness</b></a> reporting that he was last seen leaving his surgery on Dr Chota Motala Road (Old Greytown Road).</p>
      <p>His white BMW was reportedly found near Howick Falls on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>A search which included divers and dogs from the K9 unit had worked to try and find him, while his family anxiously waited for news.</p>

      <p>The scenic waterfall plunges down around 100m from the viewing spots, on the outskirts of the small town outside Pietermaritzburg.</p>
      <p>It has pools at the bottom and is a popular tourist spot with its lush greenery and curio sellers.</p>
      <p>Maistry said Singh's body was found by former police captain Jack Haskins, who joined the police's search and rescue teams and security companies from Howick who were looking for him.</p>
      <p>He said after a long haul up to the top of Howick Falls with Singh's body, he was identified by his family.</p>
      <p>uMgungundlovu North acting cluster commander, Brigadier Boxer Pillay, expressed his heartfelt condolences to Singh's family, and thanked all of the police, the volunteers, and surrounding shopkeepers for their assistance.</p>
      <p>Maistry singled out the Howick Falls Restaurant, Arte Facts and businesses including Spar, Pick n Pay and Woolworths, as well as a person known only as "Krish", who helped with refreshments every day for the people searching for Singh.</p>
