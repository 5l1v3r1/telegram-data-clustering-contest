      <h1>'I had it all': ABC host claims network squashed Epstein story three years ago in leaked video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:41:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>New video from inside ABC studios show host Amy Robach claiming she had the story about Jeffrey Epstein and his predatory behavior three years ago, but the network did not want to air it.</p>
      <p>The video, <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesOKeefeIII/status/1191716801178034180">released</a> Tuesday by Project Veritas founder James O'Keefe, shows Robach on set explaining to someone off-camera what she knew about the Epstein story.</p>
      <p>"I've had the story for three years. I've had this interview with Virginia Roberts. We would not put it on the air," the anchor said in the video. "First of all, I was told, 'Who is Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.' Then the Palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways. We were so afraid we wouldn't be able to interview Kate and Will that we, that also quashed the story."</p>

      <p>Robach also mentioned that lawyer <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alan-dershowitz-touts-his-perfect-sex-life-in-fued-with-epstein-accusers-lawyer">Alan Dershowitz was implicated</a> in the story because of plane logs and that Roberts had pictures and everything for the story.</p>
      <p>"It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton, we had everything," she said while shaking her head in disbelief. "I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it."</p>
      <p>Robach claimed said she was "pissed" that she was not the one who broke the story, adding, "I had it all."</p>
      <p>Epstein, the jet-setting financier, was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">found dead in his cell</a> in August, where he was facing charges of sexual exploitation of minors. He <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-arrested-for-sex-trafficking-of-minors-in-florida-and-new-york-report">was arrested in July</a>. Dozens of women had come forward accusing him of raping or sexually abusing them while they were children.</p>
      <p>Roberts, one of Epstein's accusers, also <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-commits-suicide">claimed that Prince Andrew</a> was involved in Epstein's sex abuse. Andrews has denied he was involved in any way.</p>
      <p>O'Keefe is known for releasing sting operation videos on the media and Democratic-aligned organizations. He recently released video from a former CNN employee claiming bias within the organization. The latest video is part of another promised cache of videos by O'Keefe.</p>
      <p>The <i>Washington Examiner</i> has reached out to ABC News for comment on the story. Robach released a statement Tuesday in which she said, "I was caught in a private moment of frustration. ... In the years since, no one ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein."</p>
