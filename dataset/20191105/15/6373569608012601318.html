      <p>She appeared at Plymouth Magistrates' Court on Saturday morning where she was formerly charged. She offered no pleas at that time and was remanded into custody with the intention of her appearing via video link on November 1,</p>
      <p>However, she failed to appear on that day due to illness and her case was adjourned until today, but again she was deemed by the prison nurse to be unfit to appear via video link.</p>
      <p>The case has been adjourned again to be heard on November 8, by video link.</p>
