      <p>(CNN) - It's been nearly a decade in the making, but this new Porsche-designed superyacht looks more than worth the wait.</p>
      <p>Described as "a spaceship on water," the innovative Royal Falcon One went up for sale earlier this month, and it's as sleek as any luxury sports car.</p>
      <p>Developed by Singapore-based firm Royal Falcon Fleet and designed by Studio F.A. Porsche, the futuristic vessel is designed in the style of a catamaran, with two parallel hulls.</p>
      <h3>Futuristic design</h3>
      <p>Royal Falcon One, which can accommodate up to 10 guests, features twin 4,600 horsepower diesel engines and twin Rolls-Royce KaMeWa waterjets, which offer an estimated speed of 35 knots and a range of around 3,200 kilometers with low fuel consumption.</p>
      <p>"The idea was to create the equivalent square footage of a 210-foot monohull yacht with a length of 135 feet," according to Studio F.A. Porsche, formerly the Porsche Design Studio.</p>
      <p>"The exterior was to represent speed and dynamics in a new and different way. The two hulls create a completely different stance impression, almost resembling the track of a sports car."</p>
      <p>Inside, there are four spacious guest cabins and a large master with its own private deck, a sun deck, with a Jacuzzi and bar, an observation lounge and a tender garage.</p>
      <h3>Functional luxury</h3>
      <p>Developed to "create an impression of functional luxury," Royal Falcon One's modern interior features a lot of white and blue, as well as metallic and wood surfaces.</p>
      <p>The superyacht was first commissioned in 2009, when Royal Falcon Fleet requested a yacht that "no one had ever built."</p>
      <p>According to Studio F.A. Porsche, their only stipulation was that it would be a catamaran configuration.</p>
      <p>Royal Falcon One was constructed by ship builders Kockums AB in Swedish town Nynäshamn and the project was shrouded in secrecy for several years.</p>
      <p>It comes just weeks after Dutch yacht design company Sinot unveiled a model for Aqua, the world's first hydrogen-powered superyacht.</p>
      <p>Back in February, Latvia's Latitude Yachts announced plans for the Valkyrie Project, a huge luxury yacht that would span 229 meters, making it the largest in the world.</p>
      <p>Royal Falcon One is listed exclusively on Camper &amp; Nicholsons International and its price is available on application.</p>
