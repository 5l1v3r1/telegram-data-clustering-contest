      <h1>Supporting social impact startups</h1>

      <p>Around the world, there are more startups addressing the world’s most pressing social challenges. There’s <a href="https://www.asaduru.com/">Asaduru</a>, a South Africa-based green building business; <a href="https://skilllab.io/">Skilllab BV</a> in the Netherlands, which helps refugees better integrate into labor markets; and <a href="https://limbic.ai/about.html">Limbic</a> in the UK, which uses AI to better understand mental health data.</p>
      <p>Technology can help address some of the world’s biggest challenges, from empowering others to <a href="https://ai.google/social-good/impact-challenge/">use AI to address social challenges</a>, to setting ambitious and long-term <a href="https://sustainability.google/">environmental sustainability goals</a>. When businesses and investors work together with government, nonprofits, communities and individuals, we can make real progress.</p>
      <p>Today we’re launching the Google for Startups Accelerator focused on sustainable development goals. Geared toward social impact startups working to create a healthier and more sustainable future, the accelerator provides access to training, products and technical support. Startup founders will work with Google engineers and receive mentoring from over 20 teams at Google, as well as outside experts and local mentors. </p>
      <p>Startups will be selected based on the UN’s <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> including poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice. Applications will open for startups from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the next few weeks and eight to ten startups will take part in a six-month accelerator program in early 2020. A second cohort will be selected later in the year. </p>
      <p>The program is designed to address the unique challenges founders face when building a social impact company: </p>
      <p>
        <b>Product and engineering expertise</b>
      </p>
      <p>People with social impact expertise don’t always have experience building tech products. So our program seeks to bring startups together with the best technology products, data and people to help them build expertise. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Business development</b>
      </p>
      <p>Monetization for social impact startups is complex and can involve multiple parties: The people who pay for it may not be the people who use it, or the people who benefit from it. Our accelerator will help founders connect with the audiences they need to, such as potential users, investors and advertisers. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Access to funding</b>
      </p>
      <p>While investors are increasingly seeing the value in social impact startups, there are unique challenges in attracting the right investors, and competing with traditional startups who are focused primarily on growth or acquisition. This accelerator will help participants connect and work with a wider base of potential investors.   </p>
      <p>The new accelerator is part of <a href="https://startup.google.com/intl/en_uk/">Google for Startups</a> which help startups build and scale great products by matching them with the best of Google—our people, network and advanced technologies. </p>
