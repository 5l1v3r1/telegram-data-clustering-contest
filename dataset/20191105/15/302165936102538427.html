      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 4 — The journey of Nasa’s dauntless <i>Voyager 2 </i>spacecraft through our solar system’s farthest reaches has given scientists new insight into a poorly understood distant frontier: the unexpectedly distinct boundary marking where the sun’s energetic influence ends and interstellar space begins.</p>
      <p>The US space agency previously announced that <i>Voyager 2</i>, the second human-made object ever to depart the solar system following its twin <i>Voyager 1</i>, had zipped into interstellar space on November 5, 2018 at a point more than 17.7 billion km from the sun. Several research papers published yesterday provided scientific details of that crossing.</p>
      <p>Both <i>Voyager 1</i> and <i>Voyager 2</i> were launched in 1977, designed for five-year missions. <i>Voyager 1</i> left the solar system at a different location in 2012. Both are now traversing the Milky Way galaxy’s interstellar medium, a chillier region filling the vast expanses between the galaxy’s stars and planetary systems.</p>
      <p>The solar wind — the unending flow of charged particles emanating from the outer atmosphere of the sun — creates an immense protective bubble called the heliosphere that envelopes the solar system. The boundary of the solar system — the place where the solar wind ends and interstellar space begins — is called the heliopause.</p>
      <p><i>Voyager 2</i>’s scientific instruments detected abrupt differences in plasma density and magnetic particles upon crossing the heliopause, the researchers said. The researchers said the heliopause appeared to be much thinner than expected.</p>
      <p>Plasma — the fourth state of matter after solids, liquids and gases — exists in the solar system as a soup of the charged particles beaming continuously outward from the sun and clashing with interstellar plasma that darts inward from other cosmic events like stellar explosions.</p>
      <p>“This is a very exciting time for us,” California Institute of Technology physicist Edward Stone, project manager of the Voyager programme, told reporters. “We will see a transition from the magnetic field inside to a different magnetic field outside, and we continue to have surprises compared to what we had expected.”</p>
      <p>The electromagnetic junction just outside the heliosphere was thought to be a deeper transitional place of intermingling cosmic weather, but <i>Voyager 2</i>’s plasma wave instrument — built by University of Iowa researchers — detected sharp jumps in plasma density, much like two different fluids coming into contact with one another.</p>
      <p>“Think of a cold front that forms when a very cold air mass comes down to the US from Canada,” said Don Gurnett, professor of physics at the University of Iowa. “Here we find a very hot plasma mass coming outward from the sun that encounters the cold plasma in the interstellar medium. It does not surprise me that a sharp boundary forms.”</p>
      <p>Scientists are still trying to understand the nature of interstellar space wind and how much of it can seep through the heliopause to reach planets in our solar system.</p>
      <p>“We also have galactic cosmic rays, which are out in the interstellar space trying to flow in,” Stone said, referring to the fast-moving, high-energy atomic particles whizzing around the universe. “And some of them, only about 30 per cent of what’s outside, can actually reach Earth.”</p>
      <p><i>Voyager 2</i> entered the interstellar medium far beyond the orbit of Pluto at a spot about 120 times further from the sun than Earth’s orbit.</p>
      <p>The research was published in the journal <i>Nature Astronomy</i>. — Reuters</p>
