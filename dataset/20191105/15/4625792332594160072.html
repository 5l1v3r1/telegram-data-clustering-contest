      <h1>Florida commission denies library's request for New York Times subscription citing 'fake news'</h1>

      <p>A Florida county commission unanimously denied a library's request for additional funding in order to pay for a subscription to the<i> New York Times</i>.</p>
      <p>The Citrus County committee denied the request for $2,700 annually at a hearing last month. The hearing occurred the same day the Trump administration announced plans to end federal agencies' <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-white-house-might-terminate-new-york-times-washington-post-subscriptions">subscriptions to the<i> Times</i> and <i>Washington Post</i></a>.</p>
      <p>One of the five commissioners who voted against providing the funding, Scott Carnahan, called the<i> Times </i>"fake news," and added that he agrees with President Trump and said, "I will not be voting for this. I don't want the<i> New York Times</i> in this county," according to the <i><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/05/new-york-times-citrus-county-florida-library-subscription-rejected-fake-news/">Post</a></i>.</p>
      <p>Ron Kitchen Jr., a different commissioner, asked, “Do we really need to subscribe to the <i>New York Times</i>?” Another commissioner, Jimmy Smith, wondered, "Why the heck would we spend money on something like that?"</p>
      <p>The library was not pleased with the commissioner's decision.</p>
      <p>“Someone’s personal political view does not have a place in deciding what library resources are available for the entire county,” Sandy Price, the chairwoman for the library’s advisory board, told <a href="https://www.chronicleonline.com/news/local/board-s-ny-times-decision-catches-public-s-ire/article_196d5d2a-f9cb-11e9-b4a5-cf20e35c898d.html">the <i>Citrus County</i> <i>Chronicle</i></a>. “Libraries have to ensure all points of view are represented.”</p>
      <p>One of the other commissioners later expressed regret, saying, "Our decision should have been impartial."</p>
