      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sex-scenes">Sex scenes</a> are a notoriously tricky beast, and most actors would agree one of the most dreaded parts of the job. Even the most experienced of stars have tales of accidental flashing, on-set injuries and good old-fashioned awkwardness. </p>
      <p>The obvious incidents are ones such as when <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/henry-cavill">Henry Cavill</a> admitted he got “over-excited” while filming a steamy scene for <i>The Tudors,</i> or when a then-underage Christopher Mintz-Plasse had to film his <i>Superbad</i> character losing his virginity... while his real-life mother watched. </p>
      <p>Other incidents are ones you might not expect, such as rapper Gucci Mane falling asleep while his<i> </i>on-screen partner was on top of him during <i>Spring Breakers</i> because he was exhausted after performing a concert. Or the time Emilia Clarke had a laughing fit because her <i>Game of Thrones</i> co-star Jason Momoa swapped his “modesty sock” for a fluffy pink one. </p>
      <p>Then there are the actors who can’t forget the fact that they’re working with someone they consider a friend, or are distracted because the director happens to be their real-life partner. For <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/KateWinslet">Kate Winslet</a>, both issues arose when she worked on <i>Revolutionary Road</i> with co-star <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LeonardoDicaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and her then-husband Sam Mendes. She won a Golden Globe for her performance, so hopefully she thinks it was worth it.</p>
