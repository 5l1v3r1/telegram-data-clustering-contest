      <p>Security experts don't recommend that users reboot their computers after suffering a ransomware infection, as this could help the malware in certain circumstances.<br/><br/>Instead, experts recommend that victims hibernate the computer, disconnect it from their network, and reach out to a professional IT support firm. Powering down the computer is also an alternative, but hibernating it is better because it saves a copy of the memory, where some shoddy ransomware strains may sometimes leaves copies of their encryption keys [<a href="https://twitter.com/VessOnSecurity/status/1191769109358358528">1</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/LawrenceAbrams/status/1191774133052461057">2</a>].<br/><br/>Experts are recommending against PC reboots because <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~csimoiu/doc/ransomware.pdf">a recent survey</a> of 1,180 US adults who fell victim to ransomware in the past years has shown that almost 30% of victims chose to reboot their computers as a way to deal with the infection.</p>

      <p>But while rebooting in safe mode is a good way of removing older screenlocker types of ransomware, it is not recommended when dealing with modern ransomware versions that encrypt files.<br/><br/>"Generally, the [ransomware] executable that actually encrypts your data is designed to crawl through attached, mapped and mounted drives to a given machine. Sometimes it trips, or is blocked by a permission issue and will stop encrypting," Bill Siegel, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Coveware, a company that provides ransomware data recovery services told ZDNet in an email this week.</p>
      <p>"If you reboot the machine, it will start back up and try to finish the job," Siegel said.<br/><br/>"A partially encrypted machine is only partially encrypted due to some fortunate error or issue, so victims should take advantage and NOT let the malware finish its job...don't reboot!"</p>
      <p>Siegel told ZDNet the advice applies to both enterprise and home users alike.<br/><br/>Further, ransomware victims should also take note that there are two stages of a ransomware recovery process they have to go through.<br/><br/>The first is finding the ransomware's artifacts -- such as processes and boot persistence mechanisms -- and removing them from an infected host.<br/><br/>Second is restoring the data if a backup mechanism is available.<br/><br/>Siegel warns that when companies miss or skip on the first step, rebooting the computer often restarts the ransomware's process and ends up encrypting the recently-restored files, meaning victims will have to restart the data recovery process from scratch.<br/><br/>In the case of enterprises, this increases downtime and costs the company operating profits.<br/><br/>To learn more about dealing with ransomware attacks, you can check out the <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/26164/how-to-remove-ransomware-the-right-way-a-step-by-step-guide/">Emsisoft guide on how to remove ransomware</a> and <a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/2019/5/2/ransomware-first-response-guide-what-to-do-in-the-oh-t-moment">Coveware's first response guide</a> on dealing with a ransomware attack.<br/><br/><i>Article updated shortly after publication to recommend hibernating computer instead of powering down.</i></p>
