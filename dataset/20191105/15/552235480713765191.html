      <h2>Irene Forrester pounced on Linda Ann Forrester after telling her: "I don't love you as much as I used to."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T15:49:23+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Connor Gordon</a></address>
      <p>A retired nurse who repeatedly knifed her daughter has been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">jailed</a> - despite a plea by the victim not to lock her up.</p>
      <p>Irene Forrester pounced on Linda Ann Forrester after stating to her: "I don't love you as much as I used to."</p>
      <p>The attack happened at the 66 year-old's flat in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow's Partick</a> in January this year.</p>
      <p>Her 38 year-old daughter was knifed four times leaving her with a collapsed lung and broken rib.</p>
      <p>Forrester today returned to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow Sheriff Court</a> after she pled guilty to assaulting Linda Ann to her severe injury and danger of her life.</p>
      <p>Her lawyer Neil Stewart told the hearing: “Her daughter doesn’t want her mother to receive a custodial sentence.”</p>
      <p>But, Sheriff Alan MacKenzie instead jailed Forrester for 32 months.</p>
      <p>He told the OAP: "I understand your life has been grim for a very long time.</p>
      <p>“Not withstanding that you held down valuable employment all your working life.</p>
      <p>“I recognise this offence was isolated and was fuelled by medication plus alcohol.</p>
      <p>“The reality is you have pled guilty to the most serious charge.</p>
      <p>"I consider the gravity of the offence that no disposal is appropriate other than a custodial sentence.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Family of Forrester sobbed as she was lead handcuffed to the cells.</p>
      <p>Her daughter was not present for sentencing.</p>
      <p>The court earlier heard the pair had been at Forrester's home when she suddenly blurted out that she no longer had the same love for her daughter.</p>
      <p>Linda Ann went to bed and said she did not want to speak to her mum.</p>
      <p>But, prosecutor Lorri Pidgeon told the hearing: “Forrester returned a short time later with a kitchen knife.</p>
      <p>“She told her daughter that she was going to put her out her misery and stabbed her four times.”</p>
      <p>A wounded Linda Ann managed to escape the flat into her car before calling an ambulance. <br/>Her mum also dialled 999 stating: "I stabbed my daughter. I hope she is not dead. I'm very sorry."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"She will be dead. I am guilty. It is so bad."</p>
      <p>The pensioner was later held by police, who found the knife at the flat.</p>
      <p>She told officers: "I did it. I did not want to do it, but sometimes enough is enough."</p>
      <p>Linda Ann suffered wounds to her back, hip and arms.</p>
      <p>She was fortunately able to leave hospital days later.</p>
      <p>Forrester's lawyer Mr Stewart today/yesterday said: “Nothing I’m going to say is an excuse to her actions.</p>
      <p>“There is very much a background as she was on the receiving end from her ex-husband this is her daughter..</p>
      <p>“This affected her for a number of years.”</p>
      <p>The court heard also heard Linda Ann had sent an email to the prosecutors asking for her mother not be to locked up.</p>
      <p>No further details were given.</p>
