Above this, resistance lies at $0.0888 (1.272 FIb Ext), $0.091 (1.414 Fib Ext), and $0.0959 (bearish .5 Fib Retracement). If the buyers can continue above $0.1, resistance lies at $0.106, $0.11, and $0.115.</li>
        <li>From below: The nearest level of support lies at $0.0785. Beneath this, support lies at $0.072, $0.07, and $0.065. Lower support can be found at $0.06, $0.057, and $0.055. </li>
        <li>The trading volume has seen a significant surge after the latest coin burn announcement.</li>
        <li>The RSI is well above the 50 level to show the bulls dominate the market momentum. However, the Stochastic RSI is poised for a bearish crossover signal which could send the market lower.</li>
