      <p>MONTREAL – At least one Quebec politician wants to know how the provincial government plans to figure out who qualifies as a “real anglophone.”</p>
      <p>“Is there some sort of secret password, secret handshake?” Quebec Liberal MNA Carlos Leitao asked Tuesday.</p>
      <p>This comes after Quebec Immigration Minister Simon Jolin-Barrette suggested Monday that newcomers to the province should be obliged to receive all government documents in French.</p>
      <p>He added that only the “historic anglophone minority” should be allowed to communicate with the government in English.</p>
      <p>“As [part of the] many, many measures announced recently by Simon Jolin-Barrette, this one makes me smile a bit, but it's not funny. In fact, it's quite sad,” Leitao lamented.</p>
      <p>“He doesn't appear to understand how the real world works.”</p>
      <p>Constitutional lawyer Julius Grey argues this is a "disturbing, new form of identity politics" -- something he says is spreading all over the world.</p>
      <p>"It cannot be excused as protecting French because nobody is hurt and French is not hurt if somebody gets a Hydro bill or an income tax form or medical services in a public place in another language,” he insisted.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So, who counts as a real English-speaker?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leitao asks if there’ll be some sort of test to determine whether someone is truly an English-speaker or not – his comments possibly taking a dig at the government’s <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-impose-a-values-test-on-immigrants-as-of-jan-1-1.4662012">Quebec values test for immigrant candidates</a>.</p>
      <p>“I'd like for him [Jolin-Barrette] to explain what the difference is. Where does he set the line between an Anglo, a ‘historic’ Anglo and another sort of Anglo?” Leitao asked.</p>
      <p>The immigration minister’s comments follow a report that discovered provincial employees do not respect linguistic policies. In some cases, there are no guideless at all.</p>
      <p>“The quality of the French language is important to state employees,” Jolin-Barrette said.</p>
      <p>He argued Quebec must stand firm to defend the French language, criticizing the previous Liberal government, whom he claims allowed linguistic policies to lapse.</p>
      <p>The minister is promising new measures in the coming months to make sure Quebecers follow the province’s official language laws.</p>
