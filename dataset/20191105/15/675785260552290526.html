      <p>A man was caught wandering hotel corridors to record the sounds of couples having sex in their rooms.</p>
      <p>Ms Tang and her boyfriend were staying at a hotel in Jiangjin district of Chongqing, south-west China, in October when they realised a shadow moving outside their room door in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>They alerted the police the next morning and officers reviewed the CCTV footage at the hotel to find a man crawling at the corridor, according to <a href="https://kuaibao.qq.com/s/20191104A09T1D00?refer=spider">KuaiBao</a> .</p>
      <p>Footage also captures the man taking his mobile phone out and placing it close to the door, seemingly to audio-record sounds coming from the room.</p>

      <p>Mr He, from Xishui, Guizhou province, claimed he stayed a night at the same hotel and heard his neighbour romping in the room next door.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Shuangfu Police told Pear, a video-sharing website: "Mr He said he saw a man eavesdropping outside the couple's room when he walked to the corridor.</p>
      <p>"The man saw Mr He and walked away and Mr He copied the man's move and found himself getting addicted to it.</p>

        <figcaption>He was arrested and detained in prison for five days</figcaption>

      <p>"He did this to satisfy his physical and psychological needs."</p>
      <p>Mr He also told the police he had returned to the hotel several times in a bid to record other couples' intimate moments.</p>
      <p>He has since been jailed for five days, according to local authorities.</p>
