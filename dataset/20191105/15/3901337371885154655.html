      <p>With the next Soweto Derby on the horizon, it's now been revealed that former Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates goalkeeper Brilliant Khuzwayo will return to the fixture for the half-time show of the crunch tie. Check it out!</p>
      <p>Fans will no doubt be excited at the prospect of seeing Khuzwayo putting on his gloves again following his premature retirement from the game earlier this season – the shot-stopper was forced to hang up his boots and gloves, if you like, after it emerged that he had a career-threatening foot injury.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, the PSL has now released a statement in which they revealed that Khuzwayo would be part of the upcoming Soweto Derby half-time showpiece.</p>
      <p>"Brilliant Khuzwayo, a man who has played for both Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates, will return to a stadium that is all too familiar to him when he stands between the goal posts for the half-time Absa Premiership Woza Nazo Shootout," a PSL press release read.</p>
      <p><i>"</i>At half-time, Absa will continue with the popular Woza Nazo Shootout that will see the sixth football supporter this season winning an instant cash prize of R100 000.</p>
      <p>"During half-time, five Absa customers will be brought to the pitch to kick against recently retired former Amakhosi and Buccaneers goalkeeper Khuzwayo, in a sudden death competition to determine the winner."</p>
