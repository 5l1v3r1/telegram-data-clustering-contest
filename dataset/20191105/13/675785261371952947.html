      <p>While <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cats">cats</a> are usually seen as pets these days, back in Ancient Egypt the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/animals">animals</a> were held in the highest esteem.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/archaeology">scientists</a> from the Research Institute of Computer Science and Random Systems have analysed the 2,500-year-old mummified remains of one such cat, with rather surprising results.</p>
      <p>The team first scanned the mummy using a CT scan, before using the images to create 3D reconstructions of the cat.</p>
      <p>This allowed them to visualise the cat in a non-destructive way.</p>
      <p>The reconstruction revealed that the cat was missing a skull and any vertebrae or ribs, but had five hind legs and three complete tails.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, a textile ball was in place of the head, although the researchers don’t know why.</p>
      <p>Theophane Nicolas, a researcher involved in the project, said: “We expected to see a cat and not several cats, but it is perhaps not so exceptional.</p>
      <p>“There are millions of animal mummies, but few have been imagined. Some are empty, others contain only one bone, sometimes the cat is complete.”</p>

      <p>While the reason for the strange findings remains unclear, the researchers have several theories.</p>
      <p>Mr Nicolas added: “Some researchers believe that we are dealing with an ancient scam organised by unscrupulous priests, we believe on the contrary that there are innumerable ways to make animal mummies.</p>
      <p>“We will know more once we have made a body of imagery, which joins a field of study that is developing on a global scale.”</p>
