      <h1>ATM Coin Founders Ordered to Pay $4.25 Million for Fraud</h1>

      <p>In a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission-led case, a court has fined another cryptocurrency investment scheme for fraud and misappropriating client funds.</p>
      <p>According to a CFTC news release from Friday, the district court for the Eastern District of New York <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8069-19">ordered</a> a fine of $4.25 million against Blake Harrison Kantor and Nathan Mullins plus four firms including Blue Bit Banc, Blue Bit Analytics, Mercury Cove and G. Thomas Client Services.</p>
      <p>The order included a civil monetary payment penalty against Kantor and the firms for $2.5 million, while Mullins received a penalty of $300,000. Kantor and Mullins were further ordered to hand over “ill-gotten gains” of $515,759 and $89,574, respectively.</p>
      <p>The CFTC <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7714-18">first filed</a> the case against Kantor and his associates in April 2018 for fraud involving binary options – a financial product giving a fixed monetary outcome or none at all – and the cryptocurrency ATM Coin. Under the scheme, the defendants used in-house software to alter the outcome of binary options in favor of the firm, Blue Bit Banc.</p>
      <p>Investor funds were also transferred into the “worthless” crypto, which Kantor and Mullins told investors was “worth substantial sums of money.”</p>
      <p>The CFTC said the defendants further persuaded customers to deposit money in accounts in the island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, increasing the difficulty of tracking such investments.</p>
      <p>Although the defendants are ordered to pay restitution to victims, the CFTC noted they may not hold assets equal to the stated order.</p>
