      <p>The <b>BMW iNext</b> crossover has been spied again, although it's not clear if the company will use the iNext name for the production crossover.</p>
      <p>While this latest <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-inext/">iNext</a> prototype is wearing less camouflage than earlier vehicles, there are still plenty of false body panels, especially around the front and rear of the car, as well as around the D-pillar area.</p>
      <p>The front fascia is largely blocked off and we're unable to see what BMW has decided to do with the brand's signature double-kidney grille.</p>

      <p>Unlike recent additions to the BMW i range, such as the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/bmw-ix3/">iX3</a>, the iNext will have a body that's distinct from conventionally powered models, and seems to feature a clamshell bonnet and tailgate, as well as frameless side windows.</p>
      <p>Our spy photography agency was again able to snap some photos of the iNext's interior, including the curved panel which houses both the infotainment system and instrumentation displays.</p>
      <p>We can also see the car's two-spoke steering wheel, thin central air vents, and a stubby gear transmission controller in the centre console.</p>

      <p>Not much is known about the car's drivetrain, but the company has previously confirmed it will be available with a battery pack capable of up to 600 kilometres of driving between charges.</p>
      <p>The car will also serve as BMW's flagship for self-driving vehicle technology, and will be capable of Level 3 autonomy. If so equipped, the car can drive itself without the driver's hands on the steering wheel, but will prompt the driver to retake command if conditions prove to be too challenging.</p>
