        <b>Jockey Frankie Dettori said he wanted to cry after his narrow Melbourne Cup defeat on Master Of Reality and subsequent demotion and eight-day ban.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 48-year-old, who is in the latter stages of a trophy-laden career, has featured 17 times in Australia's 'race that stops a nation' but never won.</p>
      <p>He looked set to end the 26-year losing stretch but was just headed by winner Vow And Declare in a tight finish.</p>
      <p>Nick Williams, who owns Dettori's mount, said: "I'm shattered for him."</p>
      <p>Vow And Declare, ridden up the inside rail by Craig Williams for trainer Danny O'Brien, provided an all-Australian success.</p>

      <p>Stewards inquired into the finish of the race and Master Of Reality, trained in Ireland by Joseph O'Brien, was demoted to fourth from second.</p>
      <p>Dettori was penalised for impeding the run of fourth-placed Il Paradiso, trained by Joseph's father Aidan, who was promoted to third, with British hope Prince Of Arran upgraded a place to second.</p>
      <p>"I want to cry," was Dettori's only reaction after the two-mile contest.</p>
      <p>The Italian jockey was given a nine-meeting suspension from riding in the state of Victoria, although he is about to start a four-week stint in Japan.</p>
      <p>Prince Of Arran's jockey Michael Walker was fined AUS10,000 (Â£5,400) and suspended for seven race meetings for overuse of the whip.</p>
      <p>The race took place against a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-50257902">backdrop of welfare concerns</a> after six equine fatalities since 2013 and separate horse cruelty claims in Australia.</p>
      <p>Of the 24 runners, all returned safely apart from Rostropovich, who sustained a stress fracture in his pelvis.</p>
      <p>The gelding was described by Racing Victoria as being "in a stable condition, comfortable and receiving the best veterinary care".</p>

      <p>Tuesday's race marked the latest chapter in a remarkable year for Dettori, who has secured a personal record of 19 top-level Group One wins.</p>
      <p>This defeat comes after surprise losses last month on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/49952657">Enable in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe</a> and Stradivarius on British Champions Day at Ascot.</p>
      <p>It is not the first time Dettori has fallen foul of the stewards in the Melbourne Cup, with the rider banned for a month and fined A$20,000 for causing interference on runner-up Max Dynamite four years ago. He was also suspended for a month for careless riding on Mamool in 2004.</p>
      <p>Nick Williams said: "Nothing would have been better than for Master Of Reality to have won the race for him."</p>
      <p>Joseph O'Brien, who won the 2017 Melbourne Cup with Rekindling, said he was disappointed for Dettori, who was second in the 1999 renewal on Central Park.</p>
      <p>"I'm more gutted for Frankie than I am for myself," he told The Age. "I'll be back. I don't know if Frankie is ever going to win this race."</p>
      <p>Dettori, who is 49 next month, had often said he might retire when he reaches 50, though he <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/horse-racing/46978900">told the BBC in January</a> he could go on for another five years.</p>
