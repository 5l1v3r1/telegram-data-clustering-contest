      <p>MADISON, Wis. -- Students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison campus will soon be able to have their dining hall food delivered.<br/><br/>However, this isn't regular delivery. These meals will be transported by robots.<br/><br/>The school is launching the new delivery service with a fleet of 30 autonomous robots from Starship Technologies.<br/><br/>Students can order their food from an app and drop a pin where they want it delivered. The service will cost about $2 per delivery.<br/><br/>Students will be able to pay through their campus meal card.<br/><br/>They can even track the robot's progress on the app.<br/><br/>Each a robot can carry about twenty pounds.<br/><br/>"It's something our students have been requesting for a while now and quite frankly when they come to us with Uber Eats and Grubhub and those companies being around for so long it's a service they expect, and now with this technology we're able to offer it to them," said Director, University Housing Dining &amp; Culinary Services Peter Testor.<br/><br/>Starship Technologies said the robots have made more than 150,000 autonomous deliveries so far.</p>
