      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and Bursa Malaysia Bhd plan to establish a learning collaboration to promote a corruption-free Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Bursa Malaysia chairman Datuk Shireen Ann Zaharah Muhiudeen said through this learning collaboration, both sides would benefit from the sharing of knowledge and experiences.</p>
      <p>“This, in turn, will enhance the skills and learning capabilities of the MACC and Bursa Malaysia officers in carrying out their respective roles.” she said in a statement today.</p>
      <p>Both parties expressed their mutual interest to collaborate at the “Building Trust and Transparency: Collaborate, Accelerate, Strengthen” conference jointly organised by the Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers (AICB) and Compliance Officers’ Networking Group here today.</p>
      <p>The learning collaboration will involve the placement of MACC officers in Bursa Malaysia for a certain period of time to learn and better understand Malaysia’s capital market regulations in the current environment, including market supervision and investigation.</p>
      <p>The statement said the collaborative effort would also look into initiatives to create awareness and preparedness among public listed-companies of the new Section 17A of the MACC Act 2009.</p>
      <p>Section 17A imposes liability for corruption on commercial organisations, including companies, as well as their directors, officers and persons managing the company’s affairs.</p>
      <p>It will come into effect on June 1, 2020. — Bernama</p>
