      <p>Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 13.3 update to developers, one week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/28/apple-releases-tvos-13-2/">releasing the tvOS 13.2 update</a>. <br/><br/>Designed for the fourth and fifth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> models, the new tvOS 13.3developer beta can be downloaded onto the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ via a profile that's installed using Xcode.</p>

      <p>tvOS updates (aside from major releases) have historically been minor in scale, focusing on under-the-hood bug fixes and improvements rather than major outward-facing changes. Apple provides little to no information on what's included in tvOS beta updates, so we may not discover anything new after installing the software. <br/><br/>In tvOS 13.2, for example, Apple's only available information was that it included general performance and stability updates. <br/><br/>While we don't often know what's new in tvOS during the beta testing process, we let <i>MacRumors</i> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download it upon release. <br/><br/>If we find anything new in the tvOS 13.3 beta, we'll update this article.</p>
