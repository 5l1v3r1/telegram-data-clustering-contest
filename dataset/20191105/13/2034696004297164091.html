        <b>Spoilers for season 10 of 'The Walking Dead' below.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Episode 5 of the current tenth season of <a href="http://nme.com/tag/the-walking-dead"><i>The Walking Dead</i></a> aired at the weekend (November 3), and contains a very meta easter egg.</p>
      <p>The episode, entitled <i>What It Always Is</i>, sees Magna listening to music on a gramophone during a scene with herself and Yumiko.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Eagle-eyed (or eared) fans have spotted that the song playing in the scene is ‘The Turtle and the Monkey’, which is written and sung by former <i>Walking Dead</i> star Emily Kinney, who played Beth Greene on the show. Kinney has since confirmed in a tweet that the song playing is indeed hers.</p>

      <p>With the meta connections not stopping there, the version of ‘The Turtle and the Monkey’ playing in the show is actually sung by a male voice, and fans believe that it’s that of Beta, the <i>Walking Dead</i> character who’s a major part of The Whisperers.</p>
      <p>Fans believe that Beta had a celebrity past before he became the masked villain, and actor Ryan Hurst recently responded to the speculation, saying: “I can’t say too much. All I can say at this point is maybe Beta was a large personality in the world before the apocalypse, and that sort of letting go of that might have been tragic to his psyche. I can’t say much more than that.”</p>
