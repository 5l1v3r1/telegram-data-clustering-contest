      <p>Since watching her Netflix special and regular appearances on <i>8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown</i>, Aisling Bea has quickly become one of my favourite comedians. Her combination of dry wit and impeccable timing have had me in stitches more times than I can count, but recently she's been showing off her acting chops. In the summer Bea wrote and acted in her own Channel 4 series <i>This Way Up</i>, and she is currently starring opposite Paul Rudd in the Netflix series <i>Living With Yourself</i>. Safe to say she's been pretty busy, but <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/who-plays-kate-on-living-with-yourself-aisling-bea-was-drawn-to-her-right-away-19224596">will Aisling Bea tour in 2020?</a></p>
      <p>Well, it’s not looking likely. A rep for Bea told me that there are currently “no plans on [this] front”. Another said that “at the moment Aisling is focusing on her TV and writing commitments.” She’s also doing a lot of press for <i>Living With Yourself </i>at the moment, which may overrun into next year.</p>
      <p>That being said, the page that lists <a href="https://www.aislingbea.com/gigs/">live dates on Bea's website</a> encourages fans to check her Twitter as Bea is “bad at updating her gig list”, with some being underground and unlisted. Obviously, if a tour were to pop up, it would appear on there as it’s a pretty big deal, but they’ll more than likely pop up on that page in tandem with an announcement of sorts on Bea’s end.</p>

      <p>Bea has a sort of <a href="https://live.stylist.co.uk/speakers/aisling-bea">live date lined up at the end of this week</a>. She’ll be appearing at Stylist Live LUXE on Friday (Nov. 8), with her “very own <i>The World According to Aisling </i>talk. There isn’t much on what this talk will include other than it’ll be half an hour, but it’s sure to be hilariously insightful.</p>
      <p>Even though Bea’s <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/aisling-bea-women-s-stories-are-finally-being-seen-on-tv-a4264051.html">currently focusing on her acting and writing</a>, she’s still a comedian at heart. “Oh, I hope to never not be a stand-up,” she told the <i>Evening Standard </i>last month. “I hope to be Joan Rivers’s age and die on stage.” And ever the multi-tasker, she was even performing during filming. “I was like, ‘Don’t worry! This won’t affect my mental health at all!’ Cut to me in my flat at Christmas, crying over a Chinese”.</p>
