      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:35:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/dan-buckley/" target="_blank">By Dan Buckley</a></address>
      <p>Tayto has deleted a social media post that paid tribute to the late Gay Byrne after a backlash online.</p>
      <p>The tweet had read: "It's a sad day for the Nation (sic). Rest in peace Gay."</p>
      <p>The Twitter post included a picture of the crisp firm's mascot, Mr Tayto, looking sad.</p>
      <p>Tayto's post, coming so soon after the news of Gaybo's death, annoyed some social media users.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "It is with a heavy heart that I must announce Mr Tayto has been cancelled."</p>

      <p>Another said: "I'm gonna need some time to process that Tayto tweet. Hold tight, dear reader."</p>
      <p>Another person added: "This moronic crisp ad is how I learned of the death of a towering figure in Irish society. Pathetic."</p>
      <p>An account named Branded Hellscape Ireland, which tweets "a selection of the very worst in Irish branded content", changed its profile picture to the sad Mr Tayto.</p>
      <p>The owner also posted: "I'm retiring this account."</p>
