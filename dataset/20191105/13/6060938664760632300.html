      <h1>Rafael Nadal confirms London ATP Finals place</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:12:29+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:12</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>MADRID: World number one <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rafael-Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>, recovering from injury, confirmed Tuesday he will compete at the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London from November 10-17.</p>
      <p>"Yesterday I had an MRI in Majorca and despite a slight strain to the left abdominal muscle I will go to London," tweeted Nadal, forced out of last week's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Paris-Masters">Paris Masters</a> by the same injury.</p>
      <p>"Thursday or Friday I will start hitting services. The idea is to play the ATP Finals. Thanks for your support."</p>
      <p>Nadal took over as world number one this week from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Novak-Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> who went on to win the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>The eight top-ranked players in the world gather in London for the ATP Tour Finals where Nadal's world number one ranking will be under threat from Djokovic.</p>
      <p>The Serb would be sure of reclaiming the year-end top ranking should he win the tournament and Nadal fail to reach the semis.</p>
      <p>If Nadal fails to win even one round robin match, Djokovic could be crowned world number one simply by reaching the final after two group-stage wins.</p>
