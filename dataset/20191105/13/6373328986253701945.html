      <h1>Emma Watson Says She’s ‘Self-Partnered’, Not Single</h1>

        <b>Emma Watson doesn’t see herself as single despite the fact she’s not in a relationship; instead she considers herself ‘self-partnered’. </b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a good term to use when you’re trying to make yourself feel less guilty about eating both portions of a dessert meant for two – ‘one for me, and one for my partner, me.’</p>
      <p>I’ll definitely be adopting it for that exact reason.</p>

      <p>The self-partnered way of life would probably prove more problematic when it came to taking part in activities requiring two people, however, like buying a Duo ticket on a train.</p>
      <p>But that’s probably not a problem for the <i>Harry Potter</i> star – I can’t imagine Watson needs to scrimp on her train travel.</p>
      <p>Anyway, she’s obviously figured out how to deal with all the technicalities that go with being self-partnered, as she’s said she’s ‘very happy’ with her current status.</p>

      <p>The 29-year-old spoke about her love life in an interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-on-fame-activism-little-women"><i>Vogue</i></a>, where she pointed out you don’t need a partner – other than yourself – to feel accomplished as you head into your 30s.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watson admitted it did take her a while to accept that realisation, however, saying:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I never believed the whole ‘I’m happy single’ spiel. I was like, ‘This is totally spiel.’ It took me a long time, but I’m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.</blockquote>

      <p>With her next big birthday just a few months away, however, Watson did say she’d been feeling anxious about where she was in life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>She explained:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I was like, ‘Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30? This is not a big deal’… Cut to 29, and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I feel so stressed and anxious.’<br/><br/>And I realise it’s because there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around. If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you’re still figuring things out…<br/><br/>There’s just this incredible amount of anxiety.</blockquote>

      <p>While she might not have a husband or baby, there’s no doubt the actor has accomplished an incredible amount in her 29 years. After making a name for herself on <i>Harry Potter</i> she went on to create other films like <i>The Perks Of Being A Wallflower</i> and the upcoming<i> Little Women</i>.</p>
      <p>Watson is also a keen activist who was appointed <a href="https://www.unwomen.org/en/partnerships/goodwill-ambassadors/emma-watson">UN Women Goodwill Ambassador</a> in July 2014 before going on to serve as an advocate for UN Women’s HeForShe campaign in promoting gender equality.</p>

      <p>She has also been involved in the promotion of girls’ education as well as fair trade and organic clothing, and earlier this year Watson helped launch a free legal advice helpline for women who have experienced sexual harassment at work.</p>
      <p>Many social media users have praised the way Watson spoke about her relationship status, with a few saying they plan to adopt the term ‘self-partnered’ for themselves.</p>
