      <h1>Lawyer accused of laundering $300M in OneCoin cryptocurrency scam stands trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:02:48+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:02</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>The lawyer who allegedly laundered some of the proceeds from the multi-billion dollar OneCoin cryptocurrency scam is currently <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50289982">standing trial in New York</a>.</p>
      <p>Mark Scott is <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/11/onecoin-cryptocurrency-scam-blockchain/">accused of siphoning some $300 million</a> from the US using corporate accounts at the Bank of Ireland, whose employees were asked to <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/09/30/bank-ireland-staff-onecoin-cryptocurrency-scam/">testify against</a> him in September.</p>
      <p>Scott allegedly created several offshore investment vehicles, called the “Fenero Funds,” which were then reportedly used to launder the proceeds from the scam.</p>
      <p>Additionally, prosecutors claim he spent some of the proceeds on several luxury items, including a yacht, three homes, and a Ferrari.</p>
      <p>A former partner at major law firm Locke Lord, Scott was arrested a little over a year ago at his beachfront property in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Scott <a href="https://financefeeds.com/attorney-mark-scott-insists-no-idea-onecoins-alleged-unlawful-activities/">previously denied</a> knowing that OneCoin’s activities were potentially unlawful.</p>
      <p>For context, OneCoin was operated by brother and sister duo from Bulgaria, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-08/onecoin-leaders-charged-in-u-s-with-operating-pyramid-scheme">Konstantin Ignatov and Ruja Ignatova</a>. The pair flogged the coin at glamorous events, promising attendees that they were launching a cryptocurrency like other — except it <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/11/onecoin-cryptocurrency-scam-blockchain/">was all fake.</a></p>
      <p>OneCoin is one of the biggest scams in cryptocurrency‘s relatively short-lived history. It’s not yet known how much was stolen as a result, but estimates suggest it’s <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/04/10/arrests-cryptocurrency-scam-onecoin/">at least $3 billion</a>.</p>
