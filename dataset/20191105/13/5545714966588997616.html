      <p>SNK has released a new trailer for the <i>Samurai Shodown</i> Switch port, which brings all of the deliberately-paced sword-swinging action of the PS4 and Xbox One release to the Nintendo platform.<br/><br/>The Switch port will feature a selection of setup modes to suit your environment, and allows for two-player Vs. battle with each player using a single Joy-Con. Early adopters will also receive a copy of the cute Neo Geo Pocket Color release <i>Samurai Shodown! 2,</i> which is a neat bonus. Unfortunately, we're still waiting on an official worldwide launch date for both the Nintendo Switch and the PC port of this great modern fighter.<br/><br/><i>Samurai Shodown</i> is available on Nintendo Switch in Japan December 12. It is available worldwide now on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
