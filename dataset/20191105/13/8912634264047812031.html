      <p>MADRID: World number one Rafael Nadal, recovering from injury, confirmed Tuesday he will compete at the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London from November 10-17.<br/>“Yesterday I had an MRI in Majorca and despite a slight strain to the left abdominal muscle I will go to London,” tweeted Nadal, forced out of last week’s Paris Masters by the same injury.<br/>“Thursday or Friday I will start hitting services. The idea is to play the ATP Finals. Thanks for your support.”<br/>Nadal took over as world number one this week from Novak Djokovic who went on to win the Paris Masters.<br/>The eight top-ranked players in the world gather in London for the ATP Tour Finals where Nadal’s world number one ranking will be under threat from Djokovic.<br/>The Serb would be sure of reclaiming the year-end top ranking should he win the tournament and Nadal fail to reach the semis.<br/>If Nadal fails to win even one round robin match, Djokovic could be crowned world number one simply by reaching the final after two group-stage wins.</p>
