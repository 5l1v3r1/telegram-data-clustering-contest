      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Mi Watch is Xiaomi's very first smartwatch to run on the Wear OS platform.</li>
        <li>It will be going on sale in China next week for 1,299 yuan ($185).</li>
        <li>The smartwatch features a 1.78-inch AMOLED display, Snapdragon Wear 3100 4G chipset, a 570mAh battery, and eSIM support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-cc9-pro-here-108mp-penta-camera-setup-massive-5260mah-battery">Mi CC9 Pro</a> wasn't the only impressive new product that Xiaomi launched today. It also introduced its very smartwatch to run on Google's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wear-os">Wear OS</a> platform. The smartwatch, dubbed Mi Watch, looks very similar to the Apple Watch, featuring a square design and a crown on the right side.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi Mi Watch sports a 1.78-inch AMOLED Always-on display and a 44mm case size. The display offers 410 x 410 resolution and is protected by a layer of "toughened curved glass." Only the limited edition "Exclusive" variant of the watch gets Sapphire Glass on top.</p>
      <p>Running under the hood is a Snapdragon Wear 3100 4G chipset, along with 1GB RAM and 8GB storage. The watch uses a 570mAh battery, claimed to last up to 36 hours on a single charge. Thanks to eSIM support, the Mi Watch can connect to 4G networks as well. It also has Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, blood oxygen sensors, and NFC for making payments.</p>
      <p>The first Wear OS smartwatch from Xiaomi has the company's 'MIUI for Watch' custom user interface on top. Xiaomi says MIUI for Watch currently has 40 built-in apps, including applets to control the company's smart home appliances. The Mi Watch also offers over 100 different watch faces.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi Mi Watch is set to go on sale in China starting November 11 for 1,299 yuan ($185). The aforementioned Mi Watch "Exclusive" version, which comes with stainless steel bezels and chain strap, will cost 1,999 yuan ($285) and is expected to be available in mid-December. Xiaomi hasn't revealed any plans of launching the smartwatch in markets outside China yet.</p>
