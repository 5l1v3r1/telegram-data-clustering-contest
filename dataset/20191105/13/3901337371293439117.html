      <p>Towards the end of last month, Messi netted a brace in Barcelona's 5-1 win over Real Valladolid, and in doing so, surpassed Ronaldo's tally of 606 club goals despite having played 118 fewer matches.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old scored again this past weekend, during the Blaugrana's shock defeat to Levante, to take his tally to 609, and after that match, an incredible statistic emerged surrounding the nature of his goals.</p>
      <p>According to <i>ESPN</i>, who cited <i>Gracenote</i>, the Argentina international's penalty goal against Levante was the 500th time he had scored with his left foot for Barca, which amounts to 82.1% of all of his strikes for the club.</p>

      <p>Of Messi's other goals, 85 were scored with his right foot and 22 with his head, while two more have been credited to other parts of his body.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, the Albiceleste talisman's tally with his left foot alone is higher than the overall career hauls of players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldo Nazario, Alan Shearer, Diego Maradona and Raul.</p>
