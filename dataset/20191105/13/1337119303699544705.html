      <p><b>As the end of 2019 approaches, it’s a good time to think back and reflect on the year that was and to think about the friends, family, and co-workers in our lives who we are grateful and thankful to have.</b> While it can be difficult to find a way to express that sentiment with a gift — which is why they say it’s the thought that counts — you still want to make sure you give them something good and not, like, rock hard fruit cake.</p>
