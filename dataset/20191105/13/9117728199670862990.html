        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> has admitted he battled with mental "demons" throughout the 2019 Formula 1 season as he recorded his sixth Drivers' Championship victory to take him just one win away from Michael Schumacher's all-time record of seven.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton's second-place finish in Texas at the weekend meant that he once again lifted the famous trophy for a third season in a row, but he has admitted the struggles we perhaps don't see that were going on inside his head during another record-breaking season for the Brit.</p>
      <p>Niki Lauda's death towards the start of the season clearly impacted Hamilton massively and he called it an "emotional rollercoaster" ever since the F1 legend sadly passed away.</p>
      <p><i>"Trying to remain focussed throughout the year, that is the toughest, and only really other athletes who are at the top of their game can really probably relate to it," </i>Hamilton said to <i>Autosport.</i></p>

        <i>"It's just, 'arrive week-in, week-out, can't drop the ball' - like I did (in qualifying in United States), for example - and being (able) to bounce back from the lower days. It's not been easy for us.</i>

        <i>"We started the season honestly going off to Melbourne thinking we were going to be behind (Ferrari). It's been a real challenge, this second half of the season. It's been the toughest second half of the season that I think we've had as a team, fighting against Ferrari and Red Bull.</i>

        <i>"Every year you go through a different rollercoaster ride of emotions to get where you're going. Each and every single one of us is struggling with something in life. Whatever it may be: small or big.</i>
