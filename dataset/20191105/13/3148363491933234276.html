      <h2>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has settled a lawsuit brought against her by former New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind, who alleged that the freshman Congresswoman violated his First Amendment rights by blocking him on Twitter.</h2>

      <p>Hikind sued Ocasio-Cortez in July when she blocked him for criticizing her comments comparing border detention centers to concentration camps.</p>
      <p>“The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border and that is exactly what they are,” she said in an Instagram Live video in June.</p>
      <p>Ocasio-Cortez issued an apology on Monday saying that what she did “was wrong and improper.”</p>
      <p>“I have reconsidered my decision to block Dov Hikind from my Twitter account,”  Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/04/aoc-says-shes-sorry-for-trying-to-block-dov-hikind-on-twitter/">obtained</a> by the <i>New York Post</i>. “Mr. Hikind has a First Amendment right to express his views and should not be blocked for them.”</p>
      <p>She added: “In retrospect, it was wrong and improper and does not reflect the values I cherish. I sincerely apologize for blocking Mr. Hikind. Now and in the future, however, I reserve the right to block users who engage in actual harassment or exploit my personal/campaign account, @AOC, for commercial or other improper purposes.”</p>
      <p>Hikind said on Twitter Monday that the settlement represents “a great victory not only for me, but for citizens and free speech everywhere.”</p>

      <p>In July, a federal appeals court <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/court-to-trump-blocking-twitter-critics-is-unconstitutional/">ruled</a> that President Donald Trump can’t block people on his Twitter account because it serves as a public “digital forum.”</p>
      <p>Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute brought the lawsuit against President Trump on behalf of seven Twitter users.</p>
