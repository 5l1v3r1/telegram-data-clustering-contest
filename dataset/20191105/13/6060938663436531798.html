      <p>MUMBAI: The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/IPL-governing-council">IPL governing council</a> is planning to have an umpire assigned specifically to check "no balls" after a number of howlers in the past few seasons led to heightened concerns about quality of Indian match officials.</p>
      <p>It was also learnt that the much-hyped '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Power-Player">Power Player</a>' concept of substitutions during <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a> games was shelved for the time being as the project can't be piloted during upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (National T20), starting later this week.</p>
      <p>The GC chaired by former Test batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brijesh-Patel">Brijesh Patel</a> met at the cricket headquarters to discuss a slew of issues including FTP window, availability of foreign players, FTP of Indian team and possibility of franchises playing friendlies abroad.</p>
      <p>However the talking point was having an exclusive umpire to check on the contentious front-foot and height no balls.</p>
      <p>"If all goes well, during the next <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ipl">Indian Premier League</a>, you could see another umpire apart from the regular umpires just to "observe" no-balls. The concept sounds weird, but this was among the issues discussed in the first IPL governing council meeting which was held here," a senior GC member told reporters after the meet.</p>
      <p>"We want to use the technology. We are having another umpire for only observing no-balls. There will be an umpire, who will be focused on no-balls only. And he will not be third or fourth umpire," the influential member said.</p>
      <p>There was a lot of hue and cry during the last IPL, when some debatable decisions were taken with regards to front-foot no-balls.</p>
      <p>India skipper Virat Kohli even had a heated word with Indian umpire S Ravi, who failed to spot a no-ball by Mumbai Indians' Sri Lankan legend Lasith Malinga, which proved costly for the Royal Challengers Bangalore during one of the IPL matches.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the concept of having such umpires could be tried at any of the domestic tournament before a final call will be taken on it.</p>
      <p>On the concept of 'Power Player', the official said: "The matter was discussed but there is too little time to implement during the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, which starts on Friday, November 8."</p>
      <p>It was reported on Friday that there was little or no possibility of 'Power Player' being introduced for the time being without consent of BCCI president Sourav Ganguly.</p>
      <p>Sources close to the president had in fact said that there is no chance of implementing it for the time being.</p>
      <p>There have been questions in the BCCI corridors whether one particular IPL operations man had devised the strategy which would have favoured one particular franchise with aged players. Also a concept like this could send the potential bookies and match-fixers on an overdrive.</p>
