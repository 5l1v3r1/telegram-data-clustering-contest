      <p>FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The man found guilty last month of 2nd Degree Murder in the death of Dr. Teresa Sievers is requesting a new trial.</p>
      <p>According to court filings, Jimmy Rodgers is requesting a new trial.</p>
      <p>Documents show that Rodgers' attorney believes evidence filed by the state days before the trial would have proved his innocence. The attorney filed a motion before the trial, requesting it be pushed back so they could review the almost 5,000 pages of new documents.</p>
      <p>That motion was denied and the trial proceeded.</p>
      <p>Our legal analyst says a new trial is likely, but there would be one big challenge. “One of the problems you run into with a request for a new trial is that if that the new evidence is going to change the minds of a juror,” says Dr. Pamela Seay.</p>
      <p>Jury selection for the trial of Teresa's husband, Mark Sievers, starts next week.</p>
      <p>Investigators say he hired Rodgers and Curtis Wright to kill Teresa for insurance money.</p>
      <p>Rodgers was <a href="https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/jury-finds-jimmy-rodger-guilty-of-2nd-degree-murder">found guilty by a jury on October 23rd</a> for his role in an alleged conspiracy to murder Teresa Sievers, a Bonita Springs doctor, in 2015.</p>
      <p>Rodgers is currently awaiting sentencing on November 18th.</p>
