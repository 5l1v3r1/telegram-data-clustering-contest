      <h1>‘Panipat’ trailer: Twitterati points out that the Arjun Kapoor-Sanjay Dutt starrer has same set as Hrithik Roshan’s ‘Jodhaa Akbar’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T13:37:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Filmmaker <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashutosh-Gowariker">Ashutosh Gowariker</a> is back with another film that will take the audience back in time. The trailer of his upcoming film ‘Panipat’ dropped this afternoon that offered a perfect blend of action, drama and romance. However, it received rather mixed reactions from fans who took to social media to point out the hits and misses of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arjun-Kapoor">Arjun Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Sanon">Kriti Sanon</a> starrer.</p>
      <p>Set in 1761, ‘Panipat’ is reportedly about the Maratha empire waging war to protect the land from the invading Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah Abdali. Packed with a lot of action and sword-wielding scenes the trailer proved to be quite the blood bath. In between the gory battle scenes, were some visuals of the grand sets.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, netizens pointed out that a scene in the film was shot on the same sets that Ashutosh shot his 2008 film ‘Jodhaa Akbar’ that featured <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Hrithik-Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Aishwarya-Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> Bachchan in lead roles.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter they shared photos of both scenes and stating that it was one of the reasons why they had a feeling of déjà vous while watching the trailer.</p>
