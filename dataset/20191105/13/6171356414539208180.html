      </p>
      <p>Google has only recently introduced a feature that lets you <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/10/you-can-now-directly-send-tabs-to-your-other-devices-on-chrome-canary-v75/">share links between your desktop and your phone</a>. Now the company is testing a similar function for phone numbers in Chrome Beta v78. When you click a hyperlinked phone number or highlight and right-click any other number on your desktop, you can choose to call it right from your phone.</p>
      <p>The feature works with any hyperlinked phone number like this one: <a href="tel:123-456-7890">123-456-7890</a>. When you click it in Chrome Beta 78, a prompt opens in the address bar that asks you which device you want to make the call from. You can also highlight and right-click any phone number you come across to send it to your phone via the contextual menu entry. Either way, you'll receive a notification with the digits on your mobile device. Click it, and the number is automatically pasted into your dialer app.</p>

      <p>The feature should be live by default, but if it isn't for you, copy and paste <i>chrome://flags/#click-to-call-context-menu-selected-text </i>to your address bar and activate the aptly named flag "Enable click to call feature on desktop when a phone number is selected." Once you've restarted your browser, you should be able to use it.</p>

      <p>We can confirm the feature is available on Android 9 and 10, but we don't know if there's a cut-off for older versions of the OS at some point. 'Call from your devices' also doesn't seem to be tied to a specific version of Chrome on mobile – I'm using the stable version 77 of the browser on both of my phones, with no flags activated.</p>
