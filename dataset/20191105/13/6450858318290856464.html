      <p>Last month, Mobiles.co.uk started <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=380&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3777231-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mobiles.co.uk%2Fsamsung-phones%3Ffilter_memory_size%255B%255D%3D32GB%26filter_memory_size%255B%255D%3D64GB%26sort%3Ddefault">bundling Nintendo Switch Lite consoles</a> with Samsung Galaxy A40, A10 or A20e phones. EE just took it further and is now offering customers a choice between the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777231-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fee-free-nintendo-switch-toshiba-tv-samsung-galaxy-a70-a80-3777231%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.ee.co.uk%2Fpartner-deals%2Fsamsung-deals">full-fat Nintendo Switch or a 43in Toshiba TV with purchases of Galaxy A40, A70 or A80 phones</a>.</p>
      <p>All qualifying plans include 10GB of data and have no upfront costs, and plans start at £31 per month for the budget Galaxy A40 (64GB). The mid-range Galaxy A70 (128GB) costs £39 per month while the upper-mid range Galaxy A80 (128GB) costs £49 per month. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777231-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fee-free-nintendo-switch-toshiba-tv-samsung-galaxy-a70-a80-3777231%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.ee.co.uk%2Fpartner-deals%2Fsamsung-deals">Head to EE now to see all these plans for yourself</a>. The offer ends 25 November, right before <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>Of the three phones, we'd recommend the A80 or A70, as these offer surprisingly strong specs despite mid-range prices. At the top is the A80, which includes a stunning 6.7in AMOLED display with an in-screen fingerprint scanner, 8GB RAM and 128GB storage – all powered with a Snapdragon 730 chip.</p>
      <p>The most interesting feature of the A80 is its rotating triple lens pop-up camera, the first ever on a Samsung phone. The design lets you swivel the camera from rear-facing to front, freeing up the display area from having to host cameras separately.</p>

      <p>The A80's cameras include a 48Mp main and 8Mp ultra-wide, and a 3D depth sensor. See our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-a80-3694942/">hands-on review of the Galaxy A80</a> or head to EE now to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777231-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fee-free-nintendo-switch-toshiba-tv-samsung-galaxy-a70-a80-3777231%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.ee.co.uk%2Fmobile-phones%2Fpay-monthly%2Fsamsung-galaxy-a70-white-with-choice-of-christmas-gift%2Fdetails">pick up the phone with either the Nintendo Switch or Toshiba TV</a>.</p>
      <p>Both the A80 and A70 are designed for younger users who enjoy streaming and recording. The A70 offers specs that outdo its £369 RRP: you get a 6.7in AMOLED display (which you won't be able to find on other phones in this price range), a triple camera set-up (with a 32Mp main sensor, a 8Mp ultra-wide camera and a 5Mp depth sensor) and a whopping 4.500mAh battery that should last over a day.</p>
      <p>Under the hood, you get a Snapdragon 670 chip, 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3777231-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fmobile-phone%2Fee-free-nintendo-switch-toshiba-tv-samsung-galaxy-a70-a80-3777231%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.ee.co.uk%2Fpartner-deals%2Fsamsung-deals">Pick up the phone now from EE now along with the Switch or Toshiba TV bundle</a>.
