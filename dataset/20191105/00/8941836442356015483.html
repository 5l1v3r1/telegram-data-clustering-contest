      <p>ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) - Leipzig beat Zenit St. Petersburg 2-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday, moving to the verge of qualifying from the group stage for the first time.</p>
      <p>Star forward Timo Werner had scored five goals and assisted five more in Leipzig’s previous two games, but was only used as a substitute in Russia as his teammates took their chance to shine.</p>
      <p>Leipzig’s Marcel Halstenberg thought he’d scored in the 14th minute with a deflected shot, but it was disallowed after video review of a handball in the build-up.</p>
      <p>The breakthrough came with the last kick of the first half as Diego Demme hammered in a rebound after Marcel Sabitzer’s free kick hit the wall.</p>
      <p>Zenit started to play higher up the field and was exposed in the 63rd when Emil Forsberg played Sabitzer in with a through ball. The Austrian sent goalkeeper Mikhail Kerzhakov sprawling and finished calmly to score Leipzig’s second goal.</p>

      <p>Freezing temperatures and snow in St. Petersburg meant the game was played with the Gazprom Arena’s roof closed.</p>
      <p>Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulasci, playing his 150th game for the club, made two good saves to stop Sardar Azmoun on counterattacks, but otherwise the defensively-minded Russian club lacked creativity.</p>
      <p>The German club’s third win leaves it top of Group G with nine points and able to secure qualification for the knockout stages for the first time with a win against Benfica on Nov. 27.</p>
