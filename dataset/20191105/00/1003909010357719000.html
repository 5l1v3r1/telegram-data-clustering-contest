      <p>Calgary Co-op is buying the retail business of Community Natural Foods in a bid to expand its brand and source more locally grown goods, it said Monday.</p>
      <p>The deal was needed to help Co-op’s food business survive in the long term by offering more unique products and strengthening its financial performance, chief executive Ken Keelor said in a release.</p>
      <p>“This acquisition is an important step in that direction,” he said.</p>
      <p>Keelor said for Calgary Co-op, the purchase is like “a natural extension to serving our members’ needs, especially in the area of health.”</p>
      <p>“And of course members also financially will benefit from being able to share in the net earnings of Community Natural Foods,” he said in an interview.</p>
      <p>Community Natural Foods was founded in 1977 by Peter and Garry Wilkes. The organic and natural food retailer expanded from a single 11th Avenue S.W. location to its current 10th Avenue site before opening stores at Chinook Station and Crowfoot Market in 2000 and 2013 respectively.</p>
      <p>Garry Wilkes said the sale was part of a succession plan for the business.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an amazing 42-year journey and it was my personal wish to sell to a buyer who would steward the Community Natural Foods business and brand carefully and thoughtfully,” he said. “I believe the Calgary Co-op team is the perfect fit as our two organizations share similar values and a deep connection to this community.”</p>
      <p>Calgary Co-op said it will operate Community Natural Foods as an independent, wholly-owned subsidiary.</p>
      <p>“Really, we look to both companies to run independently and maybe learn from each other as we go,” Keelor said.</p>
      <p>“We’re not looking to walk in and make a whole bunch of changes. We’re looking to support the Community Natural Foods team and continue to build their business. And then for Calgary Co-op of course, we’ll learn more about natural foods and organics and that customer base.”</p>
