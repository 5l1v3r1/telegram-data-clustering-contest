      <h3>Appsolute Unit</h3>
      <p>For the past week, the tech press has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/airpods-pro-fit-test-how-well-do-they-stay-in/A2835696-0F62-4AF7-A53A-E49D89FCD345">breathlessly obsessing</a> over Apple’s AirPods Pro, the latest version of its <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/site-decorative-apple-airpods">wireless-earbud-slash-status -symbol</a>.</p>
      <p>Here at Futurism, we honestly can’t be bothered with a new version of the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/neaz3d/airpods-are-a-tragedy">awful, unserviceable gadget</a>. But we couldn’t help but admire this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/drpoc0/i_made_a_large_10_tall_fully_functional_bluetooth/">fully functional, hammer-sized Bluetooth AirPod</a> built by handy Redditor Master_Aar17.</p>
      <p>Seriously, just look at it:</p>

      <h3>Ear Hole</h3>
      <p>Master_Aar17 even <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GI23jxo9Etc9jYeAfx0VboKh5EKvnhMA/view">posted a video</a> of the colossal earbud playing the Beatles’ “Here Comes the Sun,” along with <a href="https://grabcad.com/library/10-tall-airpod-3d-printed-with-base-model-1">schematics</a> of the novelty-sized gadget.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, though, Master_Aar17 said he has no plans to bring the gigantic earpiece to market.</p>
      <p>“Sadly I can’t sell it because Apple would get pissed,” the Redditor wrote, “but yeah several people have asked if it’s available for purchase.”</p>
