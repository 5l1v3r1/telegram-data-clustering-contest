        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I want to thank President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> for igniting the economy to help so many people who want to work but who were previously unable to find jobs.</p>
      <p>Last weekend, I saw something in my congregation’s bulletin that I have never seen before. The monthly budget for our congregation to pay the bills was printed as: “Needed Monthly: $2,000; Received to date: $3,749.60.” It was the first time I have seen our congregation’s monthly donations exceed the budget by almost double the budgeted amount. Our congregation is about 50 percent African-American, 25 percent Hispanic and 25 percent other.</p>
      <p>I credit President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>, his economic policies with invigorating the national economy to the benefit of lower-income, working people. His economic ideas and policies have helped more such individuals than the economic ideas, policies and actions of all the Democratic presidential candidates combined.</p>
      <p>Thank you, President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>.</p>
