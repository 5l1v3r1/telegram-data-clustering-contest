      <h1>Utah educators suspended after student wears Nazi costume in Halloween</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/bailey-vogt/" target="_blank">Bailey Vogt</a></address>
      <p>A Utah elementary school principal and teacher have been suspended with pay after a photo of a child walking in the school’s Halloween parade in a Nazi costume went viral.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/davis-county-school-district/">Davis County School District</a> — located just outside of Salt Lake City — apologized for the Creekside Elementary’s student’s costume, which included tan pants and a red armband with what appears to be a hand-drawn swastika.</p>
      <p>“[The district] does not tolerate speech, images or conduct that portray or promote hate in any form,” the statement read, <a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/11/01/utah-elementary-student/">according</a> to The Salt Lake Tribune. “The district is taking the matter very seriously and is investigating every aspect of the situation.”</p>
      <p>While the school chose not to name the educators suspended, the principal of the school is listed as Steve B. Hammer on their <a href="https://creekside.davis.k12.ut.us/faculty-staff?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;const_search_group_ids=620&amp;const_search_role_ids=1&amp;const_search_keyword=&amp;const_search_first_name=&amp;const_search_last_name=hammer&amp;const_search_grade_level=">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/davis-county-school-district/">Davis County School District</a> has faced accusations of racism and insensitivity in the past.</p>

      <p>The district paid a family $62,500 in July to settle a lawsuit alleging a school bus driver committed a “racial assault” in May by closing the doors on a biracial student and continuing to drive.</p>
      <p>Another district teacher apologized in March after she forced a Catholic student to remove the Ash Wednesday cross on his forehead, saying she was unaware it was a religious representation.</p>
