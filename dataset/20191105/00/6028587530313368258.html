      <h1>New iPhone Info Confirms Radical And Futuristic Design</h1>

      <p><a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is set to shake things up with next year’s iPhone 12. Analysts are already <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/30/apple-iphone-12-leak-5g-iphone-12-pro-max-new-leak-rumor/">predicting the inclusion of 5G connectivity in every new handset</a>, now the latest leaks suggest that the iPhone X design will be phased out after three years. But Apple’s R&amp;D team are looking far beyond next year’s iPhone to the future, <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2019/11/apple-updates-their-iphone-with-a-wrap-around-display-patent-confirming-a-glass-housing-with-a-looping-display.html">as they update the patent for a wraparound display</a>.</p>

      <p>The patent (‘<a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220190324503%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20190324503&amp;RS=DN/20190324503">Electronic Device With Wrap Around Display</a>’) is a continuing patent, where the technology is <a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2013/03/stunning-future-iphone-with-wraparound-display-revealed.html">added to a previous patent</a> rather than describing or claiming something completely new. It builds on a previous patent that described a display that wrapped completely round a device.</p>
      <p><a href="https://in.pcmag.com/mobile/133639/apple-patent-leak-details-wrap-around-iphone-display">In the case of this continuation</a>, it details ‘facial tracking software’ to be used in conjunction with the wraparound display. Given the initial patent was filed in 2013, I suspect that a new interaction with the FaceID sensors is in play here, allowing the handset to know which part of the iPhone a user is looking at. </p>
      <p>In practical terms this could help an iPhone decide if it should be showing a full ‘homepage’ to a user, it could be used to decide if ‘personal’ information should be shown on a lock screen, or in the case of a phone lying on a desk to determine if a user is looking at the rear of the smartphone and therefore put the notification data at the rear of the device.</p>

      <p>It’s probably best not to get too worked up about this technology, and I would find it very surprising if this was to show up in the iPhone 12. Not only would Apple have to overcome a historical reluctance to pack ‘gimmicks’ into its handsets <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/23/apple-iphone-11-success-victory-win-samsung-screen-oled-competition/">it relies on third party suppliers for screen manufacturing</a>, and there is no sign that the likes of LG Display or Samsung’s Display division are gearing up for an ‘around the phone’ experience.</p>
      <p>The futuristic sounding wraparound screen is just that. For the future. In the short term, Apple’s display ambitions are expected to include iterative updates such as <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/28/apple-iphone-12-new-leak-rumor-120hz-refresh-competition-specs-launch-date/">bumping the refresh rate on the iPhone 12 up to 120Hz</a> to keep abreast of the Android powered competition. </p>
