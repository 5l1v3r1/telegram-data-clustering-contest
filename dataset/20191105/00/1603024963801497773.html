        <b>Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/yesbank/YB">YES Bank</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes Bank continued to see high loan slippages of Rs59.5bn into NPA with 60% being from BB &amp; below book and 40% from outside the identified stressed BB &amp; below book which was key negative. Also, the BB &amp; below book saw jump from 9% of exposure to 10% in Q2FY20 and notwithstanding the same, the BBB &amp; below also saw jump of 21% QoQ to 21% of exposure (320bps QoQ jump) due to downgrades from higher buckets. Higher additions to lower buckets &amp; lumpy exposures remains a big risk to asset quality added by sluggish resolutions. By consolidating b/s bank has been able to conserve capital and incremental capital infusion by large investor will help cushion large hits on balance sheet, but we worry it may not suffice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>We retain HOLD with TP of Rs59 (unhanged) based on 0.6x Sep-21 ABV.</p>
