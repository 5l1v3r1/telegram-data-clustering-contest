      <h1>Trump's Paris Climate Deal Withdrawal Puts The Pressure On 2020 Voters</h1>

      <p>On Monday, the Trump administration announced it had begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. However, the official exit won't happen for another year — and that's right around the time of the next presidential election. So if you're concerned about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/climate/trump-paris-agreement-climate.html">Trump's Paris climate deal withdrawal</a>, remember the 2020 election is all the more important for one additional reason: the next president could decide to rejoin the international climate agreement.</p>
      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's Tuesday announcement might be confusing, given that Trump declared his intentions to <a href="https://www.state.gov/on-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/">withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement</a> over two years ago. But there's a simple reason for this delay: per CNN, Monday marked the earliest day within the framework of the agreement that a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/04/politics/trump-formal-withdrawal-paris-climate-agreement/index.html">country could formally begin to withdraw</a>. What's more, the process will not be complete until Nov. 4, 2020, exactly one year after the announcement.</p>
      <p>That being said, it's worth keeping in mind that the agreement was non-binding to begin with. The Trump administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html">completely ignored the parameters of the Paris Agreement</a> for the last two years, even though the country has technically still been a part of it — and the administration can continue to ignore those parameters for the next year. But there's a silver lining for those in favor of aggressive action against climate change: after the United States exits the Paris Agreement officially, it can quickly rejoin, if it has a president willing to do so.</p>

      <p>According to the terms of the deal, as laid out by <i>The Washington Post, </i>the next president could elect to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/05/withdrawing-from-the-paris-deal-takes-four-years-our-next-president-could-join-again-in-30-days/">re-enter the U.S. into the Paris Agreement</a> by submitting a formal document. Thirty days after that, the U.S. would be re-admitted. So if another presidential candidate was elected and chose to submit a formal document of re-entry on his or her first day of office, the United States could rejoin the deal a month into the new presidency. And your <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/8-voting-rights-organizations-to-know-before-the-2020-elections-roll-around-13156367">vote in the 2020 general election</a> could help make that happen. Of course, POTUS has the power to do this, too — but he's never given any indication of wanting to backtrack</p>
      <p>According to a <i>Washington Post </i>breakdown of where all of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/rejoining-paris-climate-agreement/">Democratic presidential candidates stand on the Paris Agreement,</a> every candidate in the running has stated they would rejoin if elected as president. You can read each of their specific (or not-so-specific) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/policy-2020/climate-change/rejoining-paris-climate-agreement/">plans regarding the Paris Agreement</a> to get a better idea of what they've said on the topic. You can also learn more about their <a href="https://www.nrdcactionfund.org/climate-change-and-the-2020-presidential-candidates-where-do-they-stand/">climate policies beyond the Paris Agreement</a>, via the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>

      <p>Above all, if you want the United States to rejoin the deal, urge presidential <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/2020-candidates-green-new-deal-stances-are-already-becoming-big-sticking-points-16810779">candidates to offer fast-acting, wide-reaching climate initiatives</a>, and to be clear about how they plan to prioritize them. You can also declare an intention to only vote for candidates who plan to immediately re-enter the Paris Agreement, if you so choose.</p>
