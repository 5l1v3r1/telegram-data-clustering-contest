      <p>Suranne Jones and Maya Jama have joined a literary project to shine a light on the lives of women.</p>
      <p>They have recorded for an audiobook version of Gender Rebels: 50 Influential Cross-Dressers, Impersonators, Name-Changers, And Game-Changers.</p>
      <p>Anneka Harry wrote the book, which outlines the lives of radical women from history who forged new roles and expectations for their gender.</p>

      <p>Gentleman Jack star Jones has hailed the “courageous” figures in the book, and lends her voice to tell some of their stories.</p>
      <p>Presenter Jama has urged young girls to listen to the inspirational chronicle of female achievement.</p>
      <p>She said: “I believe that young women can succeed, no matter where they started from.</p>
      <p>“But girls need to believe in themselves and what they can achieve, which is why I want everyone to listen to Gender Rebels and learn about the people who grabbed life by the balls, girls who hustled, broke the rules, and smashed it.”</p>

      <p>She read the story of June Tarpe Mills, the first female action hero comic character creator, and Florence “Pancho” Barnes, a stunt pilot.</p>
      <p>Jones, who recently played Anne Lister, a 19th century diarist who detailed her same sex relationships, narrates the life of Joan of Arc for the audiobook.</p>
      <p>She said: “Gentleman Jack has given me an insight into how powerful these stories can be.</p>
      <p>“Many of the women in Gender Rebels had no choice but to disguise their gender, often risking their lives in the process.</p>
      <p>“They were extremely courageous and that alone is inspiring.”</p>
      <p>Presenter Gemma Cairney also lends her voice to the all-female celebrity line-up of narrators for the audiobook.</p>
      <p>It set to be released on June 1 next year.</p>
