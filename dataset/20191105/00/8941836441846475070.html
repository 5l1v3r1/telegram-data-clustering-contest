      <p>NEBRASKA CITY, Neb. (AP) - An Omaha man has been imprisoned for the crash deaths of a woman and her 15-year-old stepdaughter in southeast Nebraska’s Otoe County.</p>
      <p>Court records say 55-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ricky-anthony/">Ricky Anthony</a> was sentenced Monday in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nebraska-city/">Nebraska City</a> to 20 to 40 years and was credited for 380 days already served. He’d pleaded no contest to two counts of felony vehicular homicide. Prosecutors dropped three related charges in exchange for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ricky-anthony/">Anthony</a>’s pleas.</p>
      <p>Thirty-two-year-old Rachel Curry and 15-year-old Chloe Curry died on Oct. 21 last year after their pickup truck collided with a sport utility vehicle on U.S. Highway 75 near <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nebraska-city/">Nebraska City</a>. Authorities say it occurred after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ricky-anthony/">Anthony</a>’s SUV swerved into oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>Rachel Curry’s husband, Michael Curry, was driving the pickup. He was treated at St. Mary’s Hospital in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nebraska-city/">Nebraska City</a>.</p>
