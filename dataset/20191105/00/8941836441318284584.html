      <p>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - Cross country runners who lost spots in this weekend’s Illinois state meet to athletes from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> will be at the starting line after all.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/illinois-high-school-association/">Illinois High School Association</a> says eight boys and five girls competing as individuals and the team from St. Viator in Arlington Heights will be in the state finals Saturday in Peoria.</p>
      <p>They were bumped after the results of last week’s sectionals. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> runners got into the sectionals when a judge intervened, although they had missed regional races because of a teachers strike.</p>

        <p>St. Viator says “we cherish the opportunity” to practice and prepare for the big race. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/illinois-high-school-association/">high school association</a> says it’s a “fair gesture” to open the race to runners who lost qualifier sports to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago/">Chicago</a> runners.</p>
