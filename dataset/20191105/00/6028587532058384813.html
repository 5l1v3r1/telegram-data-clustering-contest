      <p><b>Topline</b>: Meetup is laying off up to 25% of its workforce, TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/wework-owned-meetup-confirms-restructuring-layoffs/">reported </a>Monday, as its owner, the embattled real estate startup WeWork, looks to cut costs after a highly-publicized failed IPO attempt and a major decrease in its valuation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The layoffs were announced Monday and were concentrated in the company’s engineering department, TechCrunch reported.</li>
        <li>WeWork may be looking to sell Meetup and two other startups it acquired in 2017, Managed by Q and Conductor, in an effort to further cut costs. It is still unclear if WeWork will move forward with a potential sale following the layoffs.</li>
        <li>Co-working giant WeWork acquired the app, which lets users organize and find in-person events centered around shared interests, in 2017 for a reported $200 million</li>
        <li>A Meetup spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <i>Forbes</i>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: The Meetup restructuring comes as its owner WeWork is looking to cut costs after a disastrous IPO attempt, the ouster of the company’s founder and CEO Adam Neumann, and the public unraveling over the last few months of the startup once valued at $47 billion. WeWork last month accepted a $9.5 billion bailout offer from its largest shareholder, Softbank, and may also be laying off 4,000 people, or 30% of its workforce.</p>
      <p><b>Tangent</b>: Meetup last month announced it was testing a $2 event fee, leading to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/15/meetup-users-revolt-against-2-event-feeand-blame-wework/#14ad35d51d59">revolt </a>among Meetup event organizers, who blamed the pricing test on WeWork’s financial troubles.</p>
