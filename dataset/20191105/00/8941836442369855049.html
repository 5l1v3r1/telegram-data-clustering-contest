      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - A British man who lived in Las Vegas and Texas has pleaded guilty in U.S. court in Nevada to bilking hundreds of thousands of victims out of at least $11 million, prosecutors said Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gareth-david-long/">Gareth David Long</a> acknowledged that he abused personal and financial information obtained through his Las Vegas-based payment processing firm, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/v-internet-corp/">V Internet Corp</a>, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jody Hunt said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Long acknowledged drawing money from checking accounts of more than 375,000 victims without authorization during a six-month period in 2013, and having employees tell victims they had authorized the charges in connection with an online payday loan application.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said evidence showed thousands more transactions totaling another $11 million were rejected by victims’ banks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gareth-david-long/">Long</a>, 40, could face more than seven years in federal prison for his felony fraud and identity theft convictions.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gareth-david-long/">Long</a> was indicted in March on a 39-count indictment accusing him of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. His plea avoided a trial.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say the company operated from 2008 through 2013. It also used the names Altcharge and Check Process, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gareth-david-long/">Long</a> registered the payday consumer loan websites fastloanfast.com, loan4utoday.com and fastloan4me.com.</p>
      <p>U.S. postal inspectors reported seizing more than $2.9 million from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gareth-david-long/">Long</a>’s company bank accounts.</p>
      <p>The government also sought to confiscate a residential property in Cedar Hill, Texas, three airplanes, cars, a firetruck and construction and farm equipment that authorities said was purchased with proceeds of fraudulent activity.</p>
