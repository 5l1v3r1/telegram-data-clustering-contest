      <p>The Income Tax (I-T) Department will soon begin issuing permanent account numbers (PAN) online using details from the Aadhaar database, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/soon-i-t-department-to-issue-pan-instantly-online/articleshow/71913680.cms">reports</a> The Times of India.</p>
      <p>The electronic PAN (ePan) facility will be launched within the next few weeks but had conducted a pilot rollout of the feature, issuing 62,000 ePANs over eight days, the report stated.</p>
      <p>The service will be available free of cost and 'on a near to real time' basis, an official told the paper.</p>

      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.</p>
      <p>The digitally signed ePAN will have a QR code, which will contain a person’s basic details and photograph, the report added. As a security measure, the information in the QR code will be encrypted, the report quotes an official as saying.</p>
      <p>Those applying for a PAN will have to verify their Aadhaar details using a one-time password (OTP).  Since individuals’ basic information will be taken from the Aadhaar database, there will be no need to upload documents to provide the details.</p>
      <p>“The move is part of greater digitisation of income tax services and aimed at providing the facility without anyone having to visit any office,” an official told the publication.</p>
