      <h1>China developing new missiles after US warning and Royal Navy threat</h1>
      <h2>Images have emerged appearing to show China's new air-launched ballistic missiles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:08:55+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 00:08</time> by <a rel="author">Edd Moore</a></address>
      <p>The first pictures have emerged of a Chinese bomber carrying what is believed to be air-launched ballistic missile, amid concerns from the United States over Beijing's growing nuclear arsenal.</p>
      <p>The images, published in a magazine in China, appear to show a H6-N bomber carrying the weapon.</p>
      <p>China has made no secret of its pursuit for an air-launched ballistic missile capability.</p>
      <p>That has previously provoked a reaction from the US, with the Pentagon fearing China is eyeing a "viable nuclear triad" - being able to fire weapons from land, sea and air.</p>
      <p>The latest edition of Modern Ships Magazine carries the images, just months after China <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/china-fires-warning-royal-navy-3302937">issued a warning to the Royal Navy</a> and the US Navy amid tensions in the Gulf.</p>
      <p>China warned it would view any <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/royal-navy">Royal Navy</a> or US warships entering disputed warships as "hostile action" in the wake of the Royal Marines' capture of an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar in September.</p>
      <p>Speculation is mounting that the images from China show a developing air-launched ballistic missile, though the plane is described simply as being able to carry "large external objects" in the captions.</p>
      <p>Only Russia currently has an air-launched ballistic missile system in use. The hypersonic Kinzhal was launched in 2017 and can be fired from a MiG-31 interceptor.</p>
      <p>The concept is one that both the UK and the US has attempted to develop. But America's plans, based on the Royal Navy's existing sea-based nuclear deterrent, linked to Plymouth's Devonport Naval Base, were abandoned.</p>
      <p>Britain and the US have not yet responded to the images. But there has been tension between the Royal Navy and China in the past - pre-dating September's incidents involving Iran.</p>
      <p>In 2018, China accused the UK of "provocative actions" when Plymouth-based Royal Navy amphibious assault ship HMS Albion sailed close to the disputed Paracel islands in the South China Sea.</p>

      <p>The Chinese told HMS Albion to leave in "an aggressive manner", taking position "irresponsibly close" to the ship, the BBC's Jonathan Beale was told.  The warship, carrying a contingent of Royal Marines, then docked at Ho Chi Minh City, in Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The Royal Navy insisted it was conducting a freedom of navigation exercise "in full compliance with international law".</p>
      <p>But China claimed the UK had entered its territorial waters without permission.  In a statement to news agency Reuters, China's foreign ministry said HMS Albion had "infringed on China's sovereignty".</p>
