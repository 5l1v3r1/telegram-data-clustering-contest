        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>What is constitutional impeachment? Where and when did it originate? When is impeachment to be used and under what circumstances? If you’ve wondered any of this, I recommend “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems” by Raoul Berger. The U.S. Constitution states a president may be impeached for bribery, treason, and high crimes and misdemeanors. Bribery and treason need little explanation. The debate comes when one attempts to define high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>
      <p>Often you hear that these are whatever Congress says they are. Well, if you read Berger, the meaning becomes clearer. Simplified, “high crimes” has historically referred to times when a president has not performed the enumerated and fiduciary duties of the office. “Misdemeanors” occur when a president, while not performing the duties of the office, becomes so egregiously bad at the job that he overwhelmingly loses the public trust. Unless a president is doing any of this, removal from office should be by the vote of the people only.</p>
