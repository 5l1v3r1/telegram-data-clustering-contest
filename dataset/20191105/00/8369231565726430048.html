      <h1>Physicist Builds a Calculator to Show What Would Happen if Earth Collided With a Black Hole</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">DAN ROBITZSKI, FUTURISM</a></address>
      <p>A new online tool calculates just how much cosmic destruction a run-in between the Earth and a <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/black-holes">black hole</a> would cause.</p>
      <p>The aptly-named <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/black-hole">Black Hole Collision Calculator</a> determines how much a black hole would expand and the amount of energy it would release if it absorbed the Earth — or <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/three-supermassive-black-holes-collide">any other object</a>, since the calculator is totally customizable, <a href="https://www.space.com/black-hole-collision-calculator-tool.html">Space.com </a><a href="https://www.space.com/black-hole-collision-calculator-tool.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Particle physicist Álvaro Díez created the tool, which is hosted on the calculator database project <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/">Omni Calculator</a>.</p>
      <p>Based on his calculations, a black hole swallowing the Earth would release some 55 quintillion times the planet's annual energy consumption.</p>
      <p>But even that destructive event would be a light snack for a supermassive black hole — its event horizon would only expand by a hundredth of a trillionth of a percent, per the calculator.</p>
      <p>The main flaw with the calculator?</p>
      <p>The artistic rendering of a black hole obliterating the Earth that pops up next to the results doesn't change to match any increasingly goofy collisions.</p>
