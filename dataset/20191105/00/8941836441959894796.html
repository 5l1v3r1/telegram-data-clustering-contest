      <h1>AT&amp;T fined $60M for misleading with ‘unlimited’ plans</h1>

      <p>AT&amp;T; will pay $60 million to settle the government’s allegation that it misled customers of unlimited-data plans by slowing down service for heavy users.</p>
      <p>The Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday that AT&amp;T; will automatically provide partial refunds to customers who signed up for unlimited wireless plans before 2011.</p>
      <p>The FTC sued AT&amp;T; in 2014 for not clearly letting customers know that if they used up a certain amount of data, AT&amp;T; would slow their speeds so much that web browsing was almost impossible. It said then that AT&amp;T; had throttled at least 3.5 million customers.</p>
      <p>The agency says AT&amp;T; is required to say prominently if data speeds or amounts are restricted.</p>

        <p>Today, AT&amp;T;’s website says it may slow speeds of unlimited plans after a certain amount of data is used.</p>
