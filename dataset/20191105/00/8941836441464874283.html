      <p>BRESCIA, Italy (AP) - Brescia has hired Fabio Grosso as its new coach, replacing Eugenio Corini.</p>
      <p>The Serie A club made the announcement on Tuesday, two days after Corini was fired following a 2-1 defeat at Hellas Verona.</p>
      <p>Grosso, who won the World Cup in 2006 with Italy as a player, previously coached the Juventus youth team as well as Bari and Verona.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old Grosso was fired by Verona at the beginning of May despite the team being in the Serie B playoff positions.</p>
      <p>Brescia, which also earned promotion to Italy’s top flight last season, is 19th in the 20-team division, a point from safety, although it has played a match less than nearly all of the other teams.</p>
