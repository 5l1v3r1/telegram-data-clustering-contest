      <p>He was speaking in support of Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, who is running for re-election after a staunch pro-Second Amendment first term</p>
      <p>Bevin’s pro-Second Amendment accomplishments include supporting and signing legislation to abolish the requirement that Kentuckians acquire a concealed carry license before carrying a gun for self-defense. Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/03/11/governor-matt-bevin-eliminates-concealed-permit-requirement-in-kentucky/">reported</a> that Bevin signed the permitless carry legislation on March 11.</p>
      <p>Trump used the Lexington, Kentucky, rally to warn that Bevin’s opponent, Democrat Andy Beshear, cannot be trusted to defend the Second Amendment.</p>
      <p>He talked of Democrat plans to target the Second Amendment, saying, “And that includes the gentleman that is running against [Bevin], they are after your Second Amendment. We can’t let that happen.”</p>
