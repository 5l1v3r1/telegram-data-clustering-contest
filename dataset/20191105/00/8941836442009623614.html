      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Los Angeles International Airport is expanding by 50% its new area for pickups by ride-hailing services and taxis after seeing long wait times develop.</p>
      <p>The expansion goes into operation at 3 a.m. Wednesday, with Lyft moving into the new space and Uber adding the former Lyft space to its area. Taxis will also have more space for passenger and car queuing.</p>
      <p>The so-called LAX-it lot opened at the end of October to remove some traffic from the central terminal area to make way for construction of a people mover train that is expected to start taking passengers to and from terminals by 2023.</p>
