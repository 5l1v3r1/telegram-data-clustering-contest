      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - The founder of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/spanx/">Spanx</a> was revealed to be the successful bidder for the skintight satin pants that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/olivia-newton-john/">Olivia Newton-John</a> wore in the movie “Grease.”</p>
      <p>Sara Blakely told “CBS This Morning” Tuesday she plans to frame the pants and hang them at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/spanx/">Spanx</a>’s headquarters in Atlanta because they inspired the company’s black faux-leather leggings.</p>
      <p>Blakely bid $162,500 for the pants, which <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/olivia-newton-john/">Newton-John</a> had to be sewn into for the 1978 film.</p>
      <p>Blakely says she is huge fan of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/olivia-newton-john/">Newton-John</a>, who sang at Blakely’s wedding.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/olivia-newton-john/">Newton-John</a> says she’s excited Blakley purchased them.</p>
