      <p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/presbyterian-healthcare-services/">Presbyterian Healthcare Services</a> and the University of New Mexico are teaming to lure nurses into some of the state’s most rural areas.</p>
      <p>The Albuquerque Journal reports the two health care organizations recently collaborated to land a $3.2 million grant to develop a residency program for nurse practitioners in 10 New Mexico cities and towns.</p>
      <p>The four-year grant from the national Health Resources and Services Administration will help nurses and midwives relocate and stay in remote areas.</p>
      <p>Officials say the program also will focus on mental health.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/presbyterian-healthcare-services/">Presbyterian</a> Director of Clinical Education and Professional Development Johanna Stiesmeyer says New Mexico’s rural counties have a wide nurse-to-resident ratio.</p>
