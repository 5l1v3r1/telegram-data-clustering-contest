      <p>LIHUE, Hawaii (AP) - The U.S. Air Force has approved a naval facility and airport as the preferred alternative site for a technical squadron tasked with monitoring satellites in support of the national security space mission.</p>
      <p>The Garden Island reported Tuesday that the Space Control Squadron would operate out of the Barking Sands Pacific Missile Range Facility in western Kauai.</p>
      <p>Officials say the squadron would ensure that military and other national security agencies have access to satellite communication, intelligence and key information.</p>
      <p>Officials say the unit is also expected to bring more federal funds and jobs to the state supporting 88 new Hawaii Air National Guard positions.</p>
      <p>Federal officials say the basing process is expected to be completed by 2020, with the unit becoming partially operational by 2021 and fully operational by 2022.</p>
