      <h1>Even The Dictionary Is Dragging This Boomer Who Believes That “Boomer” Is A Slur</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:27:01+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 00:27</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Rennex</a></address>
      <p>In what is probably the most boomer move in history, a 60-year-old man has said that the word “boomer” is the same as “the n-word”.</p>
      <p>Yep. Bob Lonsberry, a radio host from New York, feels so personally attacked by the surge of “<a href="https://junkee.com/ok-boomer-meme/226785">ok boomer</a>” that he believes the word is as offensive as a racial slur.</p>

      <p>In a tweet he later deleted, Bob said: “‘Boomer’ is the n-word of ageism. Being hip and flip does not make bigotry ok, nor is a derisive epithet acceptable because it is new.” Lol. Ok boomer.</p>
      <p>His argument makes little sense because as a 60-year-old, a person born in 1959, Bob is a literal baby boomer. The dictionary <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/baby--boomer?s=t">defines</a> a baby boomer as “a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the US between 1946 and 1965.”</p>
      <p>Armed with this information and on a mission to school a boomer, Dictionary.com shut Bob down. Hard.</p>

      <p>“Boomer is an informal noun referring to a person born during a baby boom, especially one born in the US between 1946 and 1965,” Dictonary.com said. “The n-word is one of the most offensive words in the English language.”</p>
      <p>This ultimate shut down at the hands of a DICTIONARY is probably why Boomer Bob deleted his tweet. But not before everyone online clowned him for it first.</p>

      <p>Despite deleting his tweet, it looks like Bob has invited the very thing he was advocating against — boomer shaming. His other tweets on unrelated topics are now rightfully filled with “ok boomer” replies.</p>

      <p>But honestly? None of Bob’s behaviour is at all surprising when you take a look at his twitter bio.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, ok boomer.</p>
