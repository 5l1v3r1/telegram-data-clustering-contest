      <h1>White House and Pelosi part ways on relief for drug prices</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> on Tuesday signaled President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s blunt thumbs-down to House Speaker <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Nancy Pelosi</a>’s plan allowing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> to negotiate drug prices. Her office’s sharp retort: “Working people won’t like it if he sells them out.”</p>
      <p>Despite the House impeachment inquiry, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> and top aides to the California Democrat have been in regular contact on efforts to curb drug prices, a mutual objective and a top concern for Americans across party lines.</p>
      <p>But a senior <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> official told The Associated Press that the administration has concluded <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Pelosi</a>’s plan is “unworkable” and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> will instead support bipartisan legislation pending in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/">Senate</a>. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing deliberations.</p>
      <p>The falling out imperils chances for legislation this year, already seen as a long shot.</p>
      <p>A recent study found more than half of seriously ill <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> enrollees face financial hardships with medical bills, and prescription drug costs are the leading problem.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>In a statement responding to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Pelosi</a> spokesman Henry Connelly said, “House Democrats are taking the bold action to negotiate lower drug prices that President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> always claimed was necessary, and working people won’t like it if he sells them out on one of the most important kitchen table issues in America right now.”</p>
      <p>The senior <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> official said that while <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> is not ideologically opposed to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> negotiating prices for medicines, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Pelosi</a>’s approach can’t be quickly retooled.</p>
      <p>Her bill would levy steep taxes on drugmakers who refuse to accept a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> price keyed to what’s paid in other economically advanced countries. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> official objected that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Pelosi</a>’s bill is essentially structured to give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> the power to dictate prices, and pointed to its lack of Republican support.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> is backing a bipartisan bill from Sens. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>That legislation would for the first time limit what seniors have to pay out of their own pockets for medications. It would also require drug companies to pay rebates to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> if they hike prices beyond the inflation rate.</p>
        <p>Similar ideas are also in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Pelosi</a>’s legislation, but she takes a more aggressive approach to inflation rebates and sets a lower out-of-pocket limit for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> recipients.</p>
        <p>Under the legislation that created <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a>’s prescription drug program, price negotiations are handled privately by insurers and their pharmacy benefit managers. The Grassley-Wyden bill does not grant <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> negotiating power.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nancy-pelosi/">Pelosi</a>’s bill has cleared key committees and is headed for the House floor, where it’s expected to pass on a party-line vote. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated it would save <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> $345 billion over seven years, and Democrats want to use some of that to expand benefits.</p>
        <p>Aides to the House speaker say that her bill would give <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> precisely what he had asked for as a presidential candidate, when he broke with other Republicans to back negotiating authority for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a>. House Democrats even echo <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s longstanding complaint that other countries where medications cost less are taking advantage of the U.S.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> says the administration is working with Grassley and Wyden on improving their bill, by adding special provisions to address the escalating cost of insulin, which is used to treat diabetes, and by exploring a monthly limit on out-of-pocket costs for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> recipients.</p>
        <p>It’s unclear if and when that bill would go to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/">Senate</a> floor. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would save <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/medicare/">Medicare</a> $85 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Grassley’s office said Tuesday that the senator spoke last week with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> officials, who underscored <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s backing for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/">Senate</a> bill.</p>
        <p>“Growing support for the bipartisan <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/senate/">Senate</a> bill reflects the emerging consensus that it’s the only path forward to lower prescription drug prices,” said Grassley spokesman Michael Zona.</p>
