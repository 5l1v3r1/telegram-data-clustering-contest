      <h1>Trump crony Roger Stone’s trial promises political drama</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Roger Stone</a>, a longtime Republican provocateur and former confidant of President <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, is going on trial over charges related to his alleged efforts to exploit the Russian-hacked Hillary Clinton emails for political gain.</p>
      <p>The trial in Washington, which begins Tuesday, promises to revive the specter of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as the impeachment inquiry against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> proceeds in the House.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a>’s indictment in January was an offshoot of Mueller’s investigation. He is accused of lying to lawmakers about WikiLeaks, tampering with witnesses and obstructing a House intelligence committee probe into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>A self-proclaimed dirty trickster with a flair for public drama, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a> has a history in Republican political circles dating back to the Nixon administration. He emerged as an early public supporter of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> and has consistently criticized the case against him as politically motivated.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a>, a longtime friend of the president’s, briefly served on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s campaign, but was pushed out amid infighting with campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Though sidelined, he continued to communicate with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> and stayed plugged into his circle of advisers.</p>

      <p>The indictment says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a> repeatedly discussed WikiLeaks in 2016 with campaign associates and lays out in detail Stone’s conversations about emails stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and posted in the weeks before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> beat Clinton.</p>
      <p>After WikiLeaks on July 22, 2016, released hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, the indictment says, a senior <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> campaign official “was directed” to contact <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a> about additional releases and “what other damaging information” WikiLeaks had “regarding the Clinton campaign.” The indictment does not name the official or say who directed the outreach to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a>.</p>

        <p>Stone is also accused of threatening New York radio host Randy Credico in an effort to prevent Credico from contradicting <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/roger-stone/">Stone</a>’s testimony before the House intelligence committee.</p>
