      <p>Subhash Chandra may soon lose control of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) as lenders prepare to sell their pledged shares, Mint reports.</p>
      <p>Asset managers, non-bank lenders and foreign portfolio investors, who had extended loans to ZEEL’s promoters, plan to put their pledged shares in an escrow account, the report said.</p>
      <p>The group of lenders, who have transferred a 10.77 percent stake into the escrow account, have already begun discussions with potential investors, the report said.</p>

      <p>Sony Corp and Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp have expressed interest in buying Zee’s shares that will be placed for sale in the escrow account, a source told the newspaper.</p>
      <p>“The escrow account will be created early this week and the bidding will start thereafter," the source added.</p>
      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.</p>
      <p>“In its endeavour to seamlessly distribute the sale proceeds to all lenders, Essel Group has appointed credible investment bankers to lead the divestment process,” a ZEEL spokesperson told Mint.</p>
      <p>Chandra’s Essel Group companies own a 22.37 percent promoter stake in ZEEL. Out of this, 21.48 percent has been pledged as collateral against finances availed by Essel Group.</p>
      <p>This group of lenders are the second lot to consider selling the pledged shares. VTB Capital has already secured rights to monetise 10.71 percent of Essel Media’s stake in ZEEL.</p>
      <p>The company has appointed JP Morgan and Citigroup Global Markets to help shortlist buyers for the pledged shares, the report said.</p>
      <p>VTB Capital is a subsidiary of Russian financial services company VTB Group.</p>
      <p>If both the second group of lenders and VTB Capital sell the stake, Chandra’s stake in ZEEL will drop to 0.89 percent.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
