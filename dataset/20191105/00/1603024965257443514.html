      <p>Most global firms have maintained their buy rating on HDFC Ltd after standalone net profit of India’s largest mortgage lender rose 60.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) for the quarter ended September.</p>
      <p>The company reported a profit of Rs 2,467.08 crore in the same quarter in 2018.</p>
      <p>HSBC has the most aggressive target price of Rs 2,700 on HDFC, which translates to a rise of over 23 percent from November 4’s closing price of Rs 2,181.</p>

      <p>Experts are of the view that the long-term potential of HDFC is still intact. The stock is a must for investors looking at companies that can deliver growth without compromising on safety.</p>
      <p>“We remain confident of HDFC’s business model and its ability to grow amid tough times; however, we will keep a close eye on the margin and asset-quality trends,” Emkay Global said in a report.</p>
      <p>“We roll forward our estimates to FY22 and reiterate Buy with a revised TP of Rs2,466 (Rs2,421 earlier), corresponding to ~2.4x FY22E standalone P/B,” it said.</p>

        <b>Here’s how global brokerages reacted post-HDFC Q2 results:<br/></b>
        <br/>
        <b>Credit Suisse: Outperform| Target raised to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,280</b>
      </p>
      <p>Credit Suisse maintained its outperform rating on HDFC Ltd after the September quarter results but raised its target price to Rs 2,500 from Rs 2,280.</p>
      <p>Valuations were fairly attractive at current levels as the stock was trading at 1.7x FY21e core P/B. The growth was likely to remain stable, it said while remaining cautious on corporate growth.</p>
      <p>The global investment bank slashed its FY20-21e EPS by 3-1 percent on higher opex.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Morgan Stanley: Overweight| Target Rs 2,600</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morgan Stanley maintained its overweight rating on HDFC Ltd, with a target of Rs 2,600.</p>
      <p>The global investment bank was positive on the strong underlying NII growth and individual AUM growth. Fees &amp; securitisation income were lower than estimated.</p>
      <p>Corporate NPLs increased, which was largely expected. The company used one-off capital gains to strengthen provision coverage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Citigroup: Buy| Target Rs 2,570</b>
      </p>
      <p>Citigroup maintained its buy rating on HDFC Ltd, with a target price of Rs 2,570.</p>
      <p>The Q2 profit was higher than estimates on account of lower tax. The Tier-1 ratio remained strong at 18.1 percent.</p>
      <p>The quarter benefitted from part stake sale and dividend income from HDFC Bank. It was favorably positioned, compared to its peers, given its strong franchise.</p>
