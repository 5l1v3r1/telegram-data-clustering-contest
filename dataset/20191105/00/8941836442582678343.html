      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo is calling ballooning Medicaid spending a “major problem” in New York.</p>
      <p>Cuomo told reporters Tuesday his administration is considering spending cuts or further budgetary maneuvers to address a $3 billion or $4 billion shortfall for the state fiscal year ending March 31.</p>
      <p>A state comptroller’s report released Tuesday says the governor should provide more specifics on the shortfall and his administration’s response as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>The Cuomo administration is blaming the shortfall on costly long-term care, increasing enrollment, less federal funding and payments to financially distressed hospitals.</p>

        <p>Cuomo’s administration already delayed $1.7 billion in Medicaid payments by three days, into this fiscal year, to abide by a spending cap and avoid payment cuts.</p>
