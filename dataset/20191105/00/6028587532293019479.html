      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance has been in discussions with major private equity firms to possibly take the global drugstore chain private, according to media reports. Reuters Tuesday said Walgreens “has held preliminary discussions with some of the world’s largest private equity firms about putting together what would be the biggest ever leveraged buyout.”</p>
      <p>The deal comes as Walgreens looks for ways to compete with rival CVS Health, which last year spent $69 billion to buy Aetna, the nation’s third largest health insurance company.</p>
