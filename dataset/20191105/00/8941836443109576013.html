      <p>CLEVELAND (AP) - Authorities say a man suspected in a shooting that left three people dead in Cleveland has pleaded not guilty to an aggravated murder charge</p>
      <p>Twenty-five-year-old Kielonte Harris pleaded not guilty Monday in Municipal Court to the sole count of aggravated murder. His bond was set at $1.5 million. Court records don’t show an attorney for Harris.</p>
      <p>Authorities say they found 36-year-old April Magana’s body inside a home and 31-year-old Joseph Meeks III dead in an alley outside the home Saturday. An injured Muriel Tursivio was found in a vacant lot nearby and died at a hospital.</p>
      <p>Police say all three were attending a party and were shot in the head after a verbal altercation.</p>
