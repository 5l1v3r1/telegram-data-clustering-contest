      <p><b>Topline: </b>In the latest sign that Wall Street is going after Elizabeth Warren, who is perceived as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-wall-street.html">threat</a> to big business, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon became the latest billionaire to complain about the senator’s attacks on the ultrarich.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dimon said in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-says-sen-elizabeth-warren-vilifies-successful-people.html">interview</a> with CNBC on Tuesday that Warren “uses some pretty harsh words” against billionaires that “vilifies successful people,” and that instead, he thinks “we should applaud successful people.”</li>
        <li>Dimon’s remarks come the day after billionaire Leon Cooperman <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/billionaire-leon-cooperman-escalates-feud-with-elizabeth-warren/#2b859a9d297a">escalated</a> his ongoing feud with Warren in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/elizabeth-warren-is-screwing-around-with-the-wrong-guy-leon-cooperman-says.html">interview</a> with CNBC on Monday, in which he criticized her “vilification” of the ultrarich, calling it “complete and total bull.” </li>
        <li>After decades running some of the biggest lenders in the U.S., Dimon is himself a billionaire, worth <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/jamie-dimon/#23818a9f5063">$1.6 billion</a>, according to <i>Forbes</i>.</li>
        <li>The JPMorgan Chase CEO also said that Warren’s proposed Accountable Capitalism Act would alter “the complete nature of how you run a corporation,” though <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-introduces-accountable-capitalism-act">she argues</a> it would bring greater accountability to corporate governance.</li>
        <li>Dimon instead <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-says-sen-elizabeth-warren-vilifies-successful-people.html">reiterated</a> his support for a negative income tax to incentivize workers and cautioned against large policy changes as the answer to the country’s economic problems: “The road to hell is paved with good intentions when it comes to policy,” he said.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote:</b> “I think we have to look at [how] America was founded on free enterprise; freedom and free enterprise are interchangeable,” Dimon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/jamie-dimon-says-sen-elizabeth-warren-vilifies-successful-people.html">told CNBC</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Wall Street is worried about the possibility of a Warren presidency, with several billionaires predicting a significant <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/05/billionaire-gop-donors-predict-stock-market-drop-if-these-democrats-win/#5c7c6d264956">stock market sell-off</a> should the Massachusetts Senator gain the presidency in 2020. The now <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/11/04/billionaire-leon-cooperman-escalates-feud-with-elizabeth-warren/#2b859a9d297a">very-public feud</a> between Warren and Cooperman that began last week exemplifies the backlash that has appeared since the 2020 hopeful announced her wealth tax, which she says could finance her ambitious “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/01/heres-everything-we-know-about-elizabeth-warrens-205-trillion-medicare-for-all-plan/#6c05b7531d09">Medicare For All</a>” plan. Cooperman has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/23/elizabeth-warren-corporate-america-055142">told Politico</a> that Warren’s rhetoric against billionaires is “sh*tting” on the “f*cking American dream,” while Warren <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1187124667376717824?s=20">responded</a> by saying Cooperman should “pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream.”</p>
