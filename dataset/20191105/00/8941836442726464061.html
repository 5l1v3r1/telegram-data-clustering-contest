      <h1>IOC pledges $10 million to anti-doping fight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">EDDIE PELLS</a></address>
      <p>KATOWICE, Poland (AP) - The incoming leader of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/world-anti-doping-agency/">World Anti-Doping Agency</a> asked for more money. The International Olympic Committee said “Yes.”</p>
      <p>IOC president Thomas Bach pledged $10 million to fight doping in sports, half of which would go toward storing samples from pre-Olympics testing for 10 years and the other half toward investigations and research.</p>
      <p>It was a fitting entrée for Witold Banka, the incoming president of WADA who, after taking the stage following Bach’s presentation at a world anti-doping conference Tuesday, promised he would not tolerate cheating or manipulations.</p>
      <p>“The new future of anti-doping starts today,” Banka said.</p>
      <p>Then, he called upon sports leaders, governments and private companies to contribute to a cause he portrayed as massively underfunded.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>“It is ridiculous that an organization with the status of a global regulator has a budget of less than $40 million,” Banka said. “An average football club has a bigger budget.”</p>
      <p>“We need to convince our biggest partners that if you’re a sponsor of sport, you should be a sponsor of clean sport.”</p>
      <p>Half of WADA’s budget of about $40 million a year comes from the Olympic movement, and the IOC’s injection of another $10 million contribution is significant.</p>
      <p>It has already reanalyzed hundreds of samples from the Beijing and London Olympics that have resulted in at least 123 positive tests. Bach said it will cost about $5 million to build similar storage for pre-test samples.</p>

        <p>“This would greatly add to the deterrence factor, in particular combined with” new testing methods that have been developed over the past few years, Bach said.</p>
        <p>Banka will formally be elected to replace Craig Reedie later this week at WADA’s board meeting.</p>
        <p>He’ll be under the microscope, as WADA deals with a continuing case involving Russian cheating.</p>
        <p>Russia is currently answering questions about manipulation of the data from its Moscow laboratory that is being used to prosecute dozens of doping cases. A decision on the fate of the country’s anti-doping agency is expected next month.</p>
        <p>“We can’t keep our athletes in this situation for such a long period of time,” said Yuri Ganus, the head of Russia’s anti-doping agency. “We’ve been in this crisis for five years now, and that crisis is unfortunately becoming even worse and deeper now.”</p>
