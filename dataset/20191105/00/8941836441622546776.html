      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) - Federal investigators say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/universal-orlando-resort/">Universal Orlando Resort</a> won’t be cited for electrical problems that led to lifeguards getting shocked at its water park, saying the resort was unaware something was wrong.</p>
      <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration says in a report released this week that five lifeguards reported receiving electric shocks last June at the Volcano Bay water park. The lifeguards were taken to a hospital for observation after they reported feeling tingling in the water. They were released the same day.</p>
      <p>A Universal official told investigators that engineers measured 20 to 30 volts on a sidewalk. The cause was found to be electrical wiring damaged during construction that sent electrical current through the ground.</p>
