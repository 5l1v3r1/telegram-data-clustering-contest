      <h3>Money Talks</h3>
      <p>Back in August, it <a href="https://futurism.com/richard-stallman-epstein-scandal">came to light</a> that billionaire convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein had donated substantial sums to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology — an apparent bid to rehabilitate his image after his <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html">stint in jail</a> for sexually abusing underage girls.</p>
      <p>The fallout was swift. MIT Media Lab leader Joichi Ito <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/07/business/mit-media-lab-jeffrey-epstein-joichi-ito.html">resigned</a> after it came out that he’d <a href="https://futurism.com/mit-hid-jeffrey-epstein-donations">helped hide the donations</a>, and famed open source advocate Richard Stallman <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mit-researcher-stallman-defended-sex-children-resigns">left as well</a> after defending Epstein’s sex trafficking on an MIT listserv.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ne8yvk/students-are-demanding-mit-fire-a-professor-who-visited-epstein-in-prison"><i>Motherboard </i>reports</a>, students led by a group called MIT Students Against War are calling for the termination of a third academic associated with Epstein — this one so close to the financier that, in addition to accepting donations, he visited him in the Florida prison where he was being held after his sex crime conviction.</p>
      <h3>Class Act</h3>
      <p>On the first day of a quantum computing course, one student told <i>Motherboard</i>, mechanical engineering professor Seth Lloyd launched into an unprompted “monologue” about his relationship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>“Professor Lloyd has made many students deeply uncomfortable given his long-lasting and disturbing ties to Jeffrey Epstein,” MIT Students Against War wrote in a statement, adding that Lloyd “has driven students away from classes they were interested in taking by openly discussing and excusing his ties to a known and convicted child sex-trafficker. Why is he still teaching? Why is he still welcome at MIT?”</p>
      <p>Lloyd, who previously <a href="https://medium.com/@sqlloyd/i-am-writing-to-apologize-to-jeffrey-epsteins-victims-eee805c4f13">published an apology</a> to Epstein’s victims, declined to comment to <i>Motherboard</i>.</p>
