      <h1>Tom Barrett, Milwaukee mayor, blames Trump for acid attack on Hispanic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett on Monday blamed President Trump’s anti-illegal immigration rhetoric after a Peruvian-American resident was allegedly the victim of an acid attack.</p>
      <p>A 61-year-old man was arrested by Milwaukee police after Friday’s attack that allegedly stemmed from an argument over a parking spot. The victim, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mahud-villalaz/">Mahud Villalaz</a>, told police his attacker told him to “go back to your country” before throwing acid in his face, causing second-degree burns.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mahud-villalaz/">Mr. Villalaz</a> said he believes he is the victim of a hate crime and Mr. Barrett agreed that’s “obviously” the case.</p>
      <p>“This type of racial verbal attack and now physical attack is condoned in the highest level of governments in our country,” the mayor said, Wisconsin Public Radio <a href="https://www.wpr.org/officials-denounce-milwaukee-acid-attack-hate-crime?fbclid=IwAR371wo2ccKNHtUY-5IrcchMUxi8Yu7EF6PN_1OLFy5bt3Ecy5vXn4PPOTE">reported</a>. “This anger towards people of other countries is being fed by our president. And by his followers. And what we saw over the weekend is a manifestation of that anger.”</p>
      <p>Clifton Blackwell, 61, was arrested in connection with the attack Saturday. Charges will be brought forward to the district attorney’s office in the next couple of days, police said.</p>
