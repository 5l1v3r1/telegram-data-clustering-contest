      <p>AUBURN, Ala. (AP) - Auburn University says its famed golden eagle Nova, also known as War Eagle VII, could be in the early stages of heart failure.</p>
      <p>The university made the announcement Tuesday in a news release.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old male eagle for more than a decade soared above the crowd at university football games. He was sidelined from the pregame tradition after a 2017 diagnosis of cardiomyopathy, a chronic disease of the heart.</p>
      <p>Dr. Seth Oster, faculty avian veterinarian for the college’s Southeastern Raptor Center, said a recent exam indicated the eagle could be in the early stages of heart failure. Veterinarians are adjusting medication dosages to try to treat the condition.</p>
