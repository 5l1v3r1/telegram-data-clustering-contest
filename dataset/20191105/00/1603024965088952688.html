      <p>"Our scientists worked hard on Chandrayaan 2 (mission to the moon). Everything didn't go as planned but the mission was successful. If you look at the broader perspective, you will see it is a major feat in India's list of scientific achievements," Modi said while addressing India International Science Festival in Kolkata via video conferencing.</p>
      <p>Communications with Chandrayaan-2's Vikram lander to ISRO's ground station were lost just before its soft landing on the hitherto unexplored lunar south pole in the early hours of on September 7.</p>
      <p>If the lander had pulled off the historic touchdown, the country could have joined the US, Russia and China in soft landing on the lunar surface.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said the Chandrayaan-2 mission had generated curiosity among the young and the old alike.</p>
      <p>"Scientific research cannot be like preparing noodles or buying instant pizza, it requires patience and the outcome of such research can provide long term solution to people," Modi said.</p>
      <p>There is no failure in science and there are only efforts, experimentsand success, he said.</p>
      <p>"If you go ahead keeping these things in mind, you would not face any problem in the path of either science or your life," the prime minister said.</p>
      <p>Necessity was earlier believed to be the mother of invention, and now invention itself has extended the boundaries of needs, he said.</p>
      <p>Requesting the researchers to think aboutlong term benefits and solutionswhile pursuingexperiments, he asked them to keep in mind international rules and standards.</p>
      <p>"The interest in science should be channelised in scientific temperament. It is our responsibility to channelise this curiosity and give them a platform. We have to take science and technology researches forward along with human values. Our country has given several top scientists to the world," he added.</p>
      <p>It seems scientific research has created a new wave of curiosity and motivation among young students, Modi said adding that he is happy that scientific temper is at a different level in the country now.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
