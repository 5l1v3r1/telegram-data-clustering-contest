      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - A school district investigation cleared one of three assistant principals who were reassigned following the 2018 mass shooting at a Florida high school.</p>
      <p>The South Florida SunSentinel reports Winfred Porter Jr. and two colleagues at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School were reassigned a year ago after the superintendent promised disciplinary action tied to the district’s perceived failure to penalize anyone but a few low-level employees.</p>
      <p>Head of the investigative unit Craig Kowalski wrote in a letter to Porter that they found “an insufficient factual or legal basis exists” to establish just cause disciplinary action.</p>
      <p>Director of the Broward Principals and Assistants Association Lisa Maxwell says Porter was accused of problems that fell outside his job duties.</p>

        <p>The letter says Porter is free to return to the school or remain in his current assignment.</p>
