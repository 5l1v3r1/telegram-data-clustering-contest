      <p>OGLETHORPE, Ga. (AP) - The treasurer of a Georgia nonprofit meant to benefit middle and high school athletes is accused of embezzling nearly $128,000.</p>
      <p>News outlets report <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tiffany-gomes/">Tiffany Gomes</a> was charged with theft by taking and surrendered to authorities Monday. She has since posted bail and been released.</p>
      <p>An Oglethorpe County Sheriff’s Office statement says a bank that keeps the club’s accounts contacted the club president about a loan last month. It says the president knew nothing about the loan and learned the club account that should’ve held more than $50,000 instead had only $71.</p>

It says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tiffany-gomes/">Gomes</a> later met with state authorities about the allegations and “to her credit she owned up to all of it.”</p>
