      <p>WEST POINT, N.Y. (AP) - Army has signed an agreement with the Belk Bowl to serve as the primary backup during the next six years.</p>
      <p>Beginning next year, a team from the Atlantic Coast Conference will face a team from the Big Ten in the Belk Bowl in 2020, 2022 and 2024, and the ACC representative will play a team from the Southeastern Conference in 2021, 2023 and 2025. Should the Big Ten or the SEC fail to provide an eligible team at any point during the six-year cycle, Army would be invited to fill the vacancy.</p>
      <p>Army director of athletics Mike Buddie announced the agreement Tuesday with the Charlotte Sports Foundation, owner and operator of the Belk Bowl.</p>
      <p>Last month, Army announced future bowl agreements with the Independence Bowl and ESPN Events for the same period. With those announcements, Army will have primary tie-ins with the Independence Bowl in even years and an ESPN owned-and-operated bowl game in odd years in each of the next six years.</p>
