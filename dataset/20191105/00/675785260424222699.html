      <p>While the spoilers don't actually mention the chase shown in a recent trailer, recent pictures from filming reportedly show the moment Mel's car crashes after being chased by Sharon.</p>
      <p>It's now been revealed what leads to the dramatic stunt, as Mel's horrifying plans are confirmed with Sharon facing a race against time to stop her.</p>
      <p>It kicks off at the start of the week when Sharon gets a call from Phil who is furious to have been told by Mel about her selling the club.</p>

      <p>Mel had blackmailed Sharon into selling her share of E20, while Phil remained in Portugal. Phil had no idea Sharon only wanted to go out there to buy Mel a villa to keep her quiet about Keanu.</p>
      <p>But Mel once again has been stringing her along, and after a series of demands she's now ready to drop the baby bombshell.</p>
      <p>Phil tells Sharon he's heading back to Walford to deal with the club, so Sharon begs Keanu to get Louise away from Walford.</p>
