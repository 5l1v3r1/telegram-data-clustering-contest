      <h1>Hackers Can Access Your Alexa by Shining a Laser in Your Window</h1>
      <h2>They took over one smart device from 360 feet away.</h2>

      <p>Countless millions of people use <a href="https://futurism.com/united-nations-siri-alexa-sexist-ai">AI assistants</a> such as Siri or Alexa to do everything from make purchases online to control the locks in their smart homes.</p>
      <p>Just say the command that triggers the assistant, and the sound waves from your voice will hit a part of your smart device’s microphone called the diaphragm. That causes the diaphragm to move, producing electrical signals that the device’s software can understand and respond to.</p>
      <p>But according to new <a href="https://ctovision.com/light-commands-darpa-funded-research-points-out-an-impressive-way-to-hack-smart-voice-devices-at-a-distance/">research</a> funded in part by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, cybercriminals could hack Siri, Alexa, and other voice-activated AI assistants without saying a word — they just need a line of sight to the device.</p>
      <p>A team from Japan and the University of Michigan found that an attacker could encode a command in a beam of light rather than speak it. When they then shine the light on a device’s microphone, the diaphragm moves just as it would if hit by sound waves.</p>
      <p>In tests, the researchers found they could hack Siri and other AI assistants from up to 110 meters (360 feet) away — that was the length of the longest hallway they had access to. They also controlled a device in one building from a bell tower 70 meters (230 feet) away by shining their light through a window.</p>
      <p>Someone could buy the equipment needed to command an AI assistant using light for less than $400, the researchers said. The telephoto lens needed for long-range attacks bumps that up to $600, but that’s still a small price to pay for access to anything from a person’s online accounts to the locks keeping their home secure.</p>
