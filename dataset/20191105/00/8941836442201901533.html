      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Salt Lake City could elect its first Latina mayor if a state senator wins a race Tuesday against a city councilwoman who rose to prominence fighting pollution.</p>
      <p>Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luz-escamilla/">Luz Escamilla</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/erin-mendenhall/">Erin Mendenhall</a> are already in the first all-female race to lead the capitol city, a liberal island in deeply conservative Utah where no Republican has been elected mayor in four decades.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luz-escamilla/">Luz Escamilla</a>, 41, has touted her decade of experience as a senator working with lawmakers in the GOP-dominated the state Legislature, and said she’d bring an important perspective coming from the city’s traditionally working class west side.</p>
      <p>She grew up in Mexico, came to Utah as a college student and became a citizen in 2004. Along with being the first ethnic-minority mayor, she’d also be the first member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to serve in the role in more than three decades. The issue surfaced when former mayor Rocky Anderson raised concerns she could be deferential to the conservative Utah-based faith. It’s headquartered in Salt Lake, but many residents don’t agree with its leaders politically.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luz-escamilla/">Escamilla</a> called Anderson’s criticism insulting and pointed to her progressive record at the Legislature.</p>

      <p>Her opponent didn’t capitalize on the dust-up, instead condemning “attacks on faith,” and saying they had no place in politics. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/erin-mendenhall/">Mendenhall</a>, 39, has argued her two terms on the council have given her a deep understanding of city government. She also points to her record as an activist for clean air in a valley where weather conditions can cause pollution to become trapped and temporarily make the city’s air the dirtiest in the country.</p>
      <p>She won a crowded primary after deploying a strong get-out-the-vote effort, with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luz-escamilla/">Escamilla</a> coming in second. Both have pledged to tackle issues like homelessness and affordable housing. They also both oppose a massive planned distribution hub known as the inland port that’s drawn fierce protest for its potential environmental impact.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/luz-escamilla/">Escamilla</a> has critiqued <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/erin-mendenhall/">Mendenhall</a> on the inland port, saying her votes on the city council helped make it possible. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/erin-mendenhall/">Mendenhall</a> has pushed back, calling that criticism “revisionist history.”</p>

        <p>The winner will replace Jackie Biskupski, the city’s first openly LGBTQ mayor. She decided not to run again, citing an unspecified family situation.</p>
