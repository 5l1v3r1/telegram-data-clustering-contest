      <p>“I’d rather just say it feels like it’s going to be a great anniversary for the album.</p>
      <p>“We’ll call it a birthday.</p>
      <p>“It’s not that it scares me, it’s just if you don’t acknowledge time, you don’t have to deal with it.”</p>
      <p>The singer, who is mother to eight-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe, said Christmas is an important time for her and that her “childlike love” of the festive season that “saved” her.</p>
      <p>“Growing up I had a very dysfunctional family,” she said.</p>
      <blockquote>You know, I think it’s this kind of childlike love of Christmas that saved me</blockquote>
      <p>“I always wanted to have a really good time at Christmas and they would ruin it, so I vowed in my own life I would make sure every Christmas was great.</p>
      <p>“I want to make it magical for my kids.</p>
      <p>“You know, I think it’s this kind of childlike love of Christmas that saved me.</p>
      <p>“I go through so much all year long just to have a great Christmas.”</p>
      <p>The singer spends the festive season in Aspen, Colorado.</p>
      <p>“When I get off the plane, our drivers have All I Want For Christmas playing, we have hot cocoa and some butterscotch schnapps,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Then we’ll go through the woods on a two-horse open sleigh with blankets and real reindeer.</p>
      <p>“It’s freezing cold but it’s beautiful and you’re looking at the stars.</p>
      <p>“It’s an incredible moment I love every year.”</p>
      <p>The full interview is in the December issue of Cosmopolitan, which is on sale now.</p>
