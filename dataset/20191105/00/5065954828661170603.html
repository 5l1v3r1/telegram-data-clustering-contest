      <p>MAJORITY and minority senators, voting 21-0 at Monday’s session, passed a Joint Senate-House Resolution mandating major government departments and local government units to help promote the rice subsidy program.</p>
      <p>As passed, the Joint Resolution directs the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), the Interior and Local Government (DILG), National Defense (DND), Transportation (DOTR), Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and the local government units to coordinate with the National Food Authority (NFA) and the Department of Agriculture.</p>
      <p>The Joint Resolution effectively required the Executive departments listed in the congressional resolution to “directly purchase palay from the local farmers for the rice subsidy program.”</p>
      <p>Pressure has mounted in past weeks for the government to speed up assistance to farmers, who have been reeling from the eight-year record low palay prices in the months following the implementation of the rice trade liberalization law.</p>
