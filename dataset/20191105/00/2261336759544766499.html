      <h1>UFC president Dana White says ‘big fights’ await Francis Ngannou in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T00:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Expect a big 2020 for UFC heavyweight Francis Ngannou.</p>
      <p>Although Dana White wouldn’t confirm a title shot for the Cameroonian knockout artist, the UFC president said he has some ‘big fights’ lined up for ‘The Predator’ in 2020, teasing of a main event slot in France, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/6/25/18716023/france-to-legalize-mma-in-january-2020">where MMA will be recognized as an official sport by January</a>.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, exciting year for Francis, too, because, not only big fights for him, and potential title fight, but France,” White said in a recent interview with TMZ Sports (<a href="https://www.lowkickmma.com/dana-white-tease-big-fights-francis-ngannou-2020/">h/t Jon Fuentes of The Low Kick MMA</a>). “We finally got France done. We’ve been working hard for a long time to get that place open for MMA, and we’ll do a fight there that, obviously, Francis will probably headline.</p>
      <p>“And I don’t know if you watched the fight last weekend from Singapore, but the kid, [Ciryl] Gane, big badass heavyweight from France. No [they won’t fight each other], but they’ll both fight on that card.”</p>

      <p>When asked about a potential opponent for Ngannou, White responded with the following statement.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know right now. I don’t know. I don’t have an answer to that question right now.”</p>
      <p>Ngannou, 33, has been itching for a rematch with Stipe Miocic ever since his knockout win over Junior dos Santos at UFC on ESPN 3. The MMA Factory product lost in a title bout to Miocic last year but feels he has done more than enough to earn a rematch after netting three-straight knockout victories Curtis Blaydes, Cain Velasquez and JDS. The UFC, however, is looking to book a championship trilogy bout between Miocic and Daniel Cormier, which means Ngannou could be forced to accept another fight in the new year.</p>
      <p>Expect an official fight announcement in the coming weeks.</p>
