      <p><b>Topline</b>: Gordon Sondland, a U.S. ambassador to the European Union, reversed his initial testimony to a House committee investigating impeachment, saying foreign aid to Ukraine was contingent on Ukrainian officials announcing an investigation into Burisma Holdings and the Bidens, making him the third Trump administration official to confirm a politically based quid pro quo imposed by the Trump administration on Ukraine.  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The addendum to Sondland’s original testimony was released by House Democrats Tuesday at the bottom of nearly 400 pages of testimony.</li>
        <li>In his revised testimony, which was submitted November 4, Sondland said the opening statements of other U.S. diplomats had “refreshed his recollection about certain conversations.”</li>
        <li>Sondland said he told a Ukrainian official during a September meeting in Warsaw that the resumption of U.S. aid “would likely not occur until Ukraine provided the anti-corruption statement that we had been discussing for weeks.”</li>
        <li>Initially, Sondland told House investigators that he wasn’t aware of any conditions attached to the Ukraine aid.</li>
        <li>He added that Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had made clear he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens for corruption in Ukraine and a debunked conspiracy theory about the 2016 election, and that satisfying Giuliani was a condition for scheduling a White House visit with Ukraine’s president.</li>
        <li>Sondland is the third person to publicly confirm that the White House attempted to withhold aid from Ukraine unless it carried out investigations into Trump’s political rivals (Trump Chief of Staff <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/17/trump-chief-of-staff-admits-to-quid-pro-pro-with-ukraine/#7f1340f40a45">Mick Mulvaney</a> though he later walked back his remarks, and U.S. diplomat <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2019/10/22/white-house-tied-ukraine-aid-to-biden-investigation-diplomat-reportedly-testifies/#4c5145cf1031">Bill Taylor </a>preceded Sondland).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: When the impeachment inquiry started, a key GOP talking point defending Trump was that there was no quid pro quo. But as evidence quickly surfaces to the contrary, Republicans, behind-the-scenes, have begun to admit that while a quid pro quo occurred but claim that it’s not an illegal or impeachable offense, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/us/politics/trump-republicans-impeachment.html">reported</a>. </p>
      <p><b>Chief critic(s):</b> Representative Ted Lieu, D-Calif., <a href="https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/1191801167350652928">tweeted</a>: “Pleased he added to his testimony &amp; now confirms, again, the quid pro quo by<a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump"> @realDonaldTrump</a>. You can also call it extortion, bribery and abuse of power.” Meanwhile, Senator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., dismissed Sondland’s reversal, and <a href="https://twitter.com/kathrynw5/status/1191824848978358274">said</a>, “I've written the whole process off ... I think this is a bunch of B.S." </p>
      <p><b>New peg</b>: House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions in response to a phone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky. On the July call, Trump directed Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption. Trump and Rudy Giuliani claim that then-vice president Biden pushed for the resignation of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in an effort to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a board seat.</p>
