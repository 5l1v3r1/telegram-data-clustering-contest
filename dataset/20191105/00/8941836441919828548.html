      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Scientists and leaders from New England and Canada are gathering in Maine this week for an event focused on what the warming of the ocean will mean for the region.</p>
      <p>The event’s called the Gulf of Maine 2050 International Symposium, and it’s taking place in Portland until Friday. Organizers say the purpose of the event is to “increase our collective understanding about how the Gulf of Maine is expected to change over the next 30 years and to promote regional resilience in the context of those changes.”</p>
      <p>The Gulf of Maine’s warming faster than most of the world’s oceans. It’s also home to some of America’s most important fisheries, such as the lobster harvest.</p>
