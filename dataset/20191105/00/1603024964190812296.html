      <p>Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on November 5 said it was "very understanding" of the BJP to broach the subject of sharing of Maharashtra CM's post for 2.5 years.</p>
      <p>Reacting to comments made by BJP leaders after a meeting of that party's state core team here, Raut also said imposition of President's rule will be an insult to people of Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>"I haven't heard what they (BJP) leaders said. But if they have indeed spoken about discussing the sharing of CM's post, then I must say it is very understanding of them," Raut told a Marathi TV channel.</p>

      <p>The Sena leader said, "we want a written assurance from BJP (over sharing the CM's post) as has been our stand from day one."</p>
      <p>The BJP and Shiv Sena are locked in a bitter tussle over the issue of chief minister's post, resulting in a stalemate in government formation despite results of the Assembly polls giving the BJP-Sena alliance a combined seat strength of 161, way past the 145 majority mark in the 288- member House.</p>
      <p>In the polls, the BJP won 105 seats, Shiv Sena-56, NCP-54 and the Congress won 44 seats.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
