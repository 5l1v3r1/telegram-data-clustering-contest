      <p>To celebrate his 50<sup>th</sup> birthday, the American actor announced that he’d decided to follow in Jennifer Anniston’s footsteps and start an Instagram account, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/matthew-mcconaughey-takes-inspo-jennifer-aniston-joins-instagram-50th-birthday-11042382/"><b>Metro</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>In his first <a href="https://www.instagram.com/officiallymcconaughey/?utm_source=ig_embed"><b>Instagram</b></a> post, Matthew explains why he decided to open an account.</p>
      <p>"When people come to my page, I want them to see me," the 50-year-old said in the video.</p>
      <p>"Look, this is my first venture into sharing myself and my views with the world and I’m a little bit nervous about it because quite frankly, I know I want to have a monologue.</p>
      <p>"I’m not quite sure I want to have the dialogue. But I know I have to have the dialogue, too. So I’m looking forward to it, I’m looking forward to it.</p>

      <p>"I’m looking forward to sharing who I am with you, to seeing if who I am translates, if what I want to share translates. If it tickles your funny bone, if it makes you think a second, if it makes your heart swell up a little bit, if it makes you take a quiet moment and go for a walk, let’s have some fun with it though," he said.</p>
