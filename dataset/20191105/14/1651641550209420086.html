      <p>Zack from JerryRigEverything has been testing phones for quite some time now and his videos are usually geared towards the durability aspect of smartphones. While extreme sometimes, his tests usually simulate the kind of abuse a smartphone might endure in its entire life.</p>
      <p>Today, Zack shared a new video which pushes <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/google-officially-unveils-the-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl/">Pixel 4 XL</a> to its limits and the phone cracked under pressure, literally. JerryRigEverything’s video gave customers another reason why they should skip the Pixel 4 XL. While Pixel 4 XL is certainly not the first device to crack, it’s one of the few flagships to not make it to the end of the test in one piece.</p>

      <p>As Zack pointed out in the video, the reason for multiple cracks is the bad antenna placement which reduces the structural integrity making it susceptible to bends and cracks. Unfortunately, the device developed four cracks on four sides which is definitely not good especially for a phone that costs $800. As Zack said, “Pixel tried to copy iPhone’s homework without changing anything and still managed to get all the answers wrong”.</p>
