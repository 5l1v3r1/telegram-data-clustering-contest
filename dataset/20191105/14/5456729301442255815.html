      <h1>Premium Times seeks collaboration with NAN to curb fake news</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:25:07+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/361117-premium-times-seeks-collaboration-with-nan-to-curb-fake-news.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Executive Director of Premium Times, Dapo Olorunyomi, on Tuesday reiterated the need for media organisations to deploy facts-checking techniques to check the spread of fake news in the country.<br/>Mr Olorunyomi made the call when he visited the headquarters of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He solicited partnership between NAN and Premium Times Centre on Investigative Journalism in order to set up a fact-checking platform with a view to mitigating the effects of fake news in the country.</p>
      <p>Mr Olorunyomi, who blamed the rising wave of false information on digital evolution, pointed out that it could be of great consequences to the society.</p>
      <p>According to him, dealing with truth in the media industry has become a huge challenge.</p>
      <p>“Part of it is as a result of digital transition which is affecting our profession and now we have to wrestle with the terrain of just being factual.</p>
      <p>“Our coming today is to share with you the footprints of our work and how NAN can be a partner.</p>
      <p>“The problems of fake news or what we professionally will call disorder in the information ecosystem has really made things tough.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, not everybody has the tools to understand this process very well.</p>
      <p>“Those tools are something we have to understand their origin and see how they constitute serious dangers.</p>
      <p>“We all know now that on account of fake news, elections are being decided in some of the most advanced democracies in the world.</p>
      <p>“A new pattern of warfare has also moved into the terrain which affects us,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Olorunyomi said the centre was willing to provide training for NAN reporters as well as share tools for specialised form of journalism.</p>
      <p>According to him, NAN is the most influential newsroom in the country and improving its operations helps everyone get better..</p>
      <p>“So it seems quite sensible in our own opinion if NAN is taking leadership on this, it helps every other person if NAN gets fact-checking right,’’ Mr Olorunyomi said.</p>
      <p>Responding, Ibrahim Mammaga, the Acting Managing Director, NAN, expressed the agency’s commitment to professionalism and to always publish stories that are factual.</p>
      <p>“Since we are dealing with clients both within and outside the country, we need to dish out what is more factual and that will satisfy their quest for credibility.’’</p>
      <p>Mr Mammaga said that speed and accuracy remained the focus of the agency, adding that the proposed training is apt to inculcate in reporters the ability to always be factual.</p>
      <p>According to him, there is always a need for right information so as to enable the society make the right decisions.</p>
