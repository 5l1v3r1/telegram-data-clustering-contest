      <p>(Reuters) - Tapestry Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TPR.N">TPR.N</a>) on Tuesday forecast lower-than-expected profit for the current quarter, citing weak demand at its millennial-focused Kate Spade brand and the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>
      <p>Shares of Tapestry erased gains from earlier in the morning, dropping 7% before the opening bell.</p>
      <p>Chief Financial Officer Joanne Crevoiserat, on a post earnings conference call with analysts, said she expects same-store sales at Kate Spade to fall at a high-single-digit rate.</p>
      <p>The handbag maker projected earnings between 95 cents per share and $1 per share, well below analystsâ€™ estimates of $1.09, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the company beat quarterly profit estimates on demand for its high-margin Coach handbags and apparel in China and Europe.</p>
