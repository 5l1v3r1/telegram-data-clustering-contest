      <p>MILAN (Reuters) - Italian broadcaster Mediaset (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MS.MI">MS.MI</a>) is ready to modify the governance of its pan-Europe TV reorganisation in order to reach a compromise with hostile shareholder Vivendi VIV.PA&gt;, a source said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Italyâ€™s biggest commercial broadcaster is seeking to merge its domestic and Spanish businesses into a Dutch entity called MediaforEurope to pursue pan-European tie-ups.</p>
      <p>But Vivendi, the second largest shareholder in the group controlled by the family of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has challenged the plan.</p>
      <p>A Milan court was expected to rule as early as this week on a request from Vivendi to freeze the corporate overhaul.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Tuesday Mediaset said the court had extended the deadline to Nov. 22 to give the two sides time to try and reach an agreement.</p>
