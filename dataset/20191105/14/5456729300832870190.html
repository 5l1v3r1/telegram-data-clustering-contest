      <p>International superstar and Grammy award-winning rapper, Cardi B, will be visiting Africa for the first time this December.</p>
      <p>The self-proclaimed Queen of the Bronx is expected to make her first visit to West Africa at the Livespot X Festival.</p>
      <p>Her first stop will be Lagos on December 7 before heading to Accra, Ghana, on the 8th.</p>
      <p>The show in Lagos, which will hold at the Eko Atlantic City, Victoria Island, will see the vivacious rapper joined on stage by some of Nigeria’s biggest artistes.</p>
      <p>The organisers say the event will feature an exciting mix of incredible live performances, great lighting, illusionists, top DJs, food, drinks, and festivities.</p>
      <p>They also added that the names of the Nigerian artistes who would perform alongside the American rapper would be revealed in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Since her break-out single, ‘Bodak Yellow’, Cardi B has become one of the leading women in Hip-Hop.</p>
      <p>Her burgeoning reputation was further cemented with a Grammy Award win earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Her vibrant personality and social commentary have made her one of the most influential entertainers in the world.</p>
      <p>Cardi B has, over the last few years, become a social media phenomenon, and her latest Halloween antics rocked the dailies when her choice of costumes grabbed headlines worldwide.</p>
      <p>Cardi B’s trip to Lagos and Ghana is an indication of her ambitions to conquer the world and cement her status as a global star.</p>
