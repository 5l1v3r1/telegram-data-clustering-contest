      <p>Emma Watson has gone from being a fictional childhood hero to an IRL adult one, working as an activist and UN ambassador alongside her flourishing Hollywood career. But, as with anyone who has a public platform, her love life has always been a hot topic of speculation. But <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/11-books-like-little-women-for-meg-jo-beth-amy-devotees-19277422">Emma Watson has said she identifies as self-partnered</a> after years of feeling totally differently about being single. There’s no denying that, when it comes to relationship labels, "single" is still a pretty loaded terns, but Watson has flipped it on its head and proven how outdated it is to still be fixated on whether someone is "with" someone.</p>
      <p>Watson chatted with <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/writer-paris-lees-on-why-representation-matters-the-transformative-power-of-hair-19272813">Paris Lees</a> for <i>Vogue</i> on the run up to the release of <i>Little Women</i>. Speaking about her relationship status, Watson said:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-on-fame-activism-little-women">“I never believed</a> the whole ‘I’m happy single’ spiel. I was like, ‘This is totally spiel.’ It took me a long time, but I’m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.”</blockquote>
      <p>While she has been linked to a few people in the past (including <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/tom-felton-just-posted-a-pic-emma-watson-took-of-him-at-the-beach-omg-my-heart-18669770"><i>Harry Potter</i> co-star Tom Felton</a>), she has confirmed she isn’t seeing anyone romantically right now and couldn’t be happier.</p>
      <p>However, she also revealed she isn’t totally exempt from societal pressures. She said in <i>Vogue</i>, “I was like, 'Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30? This is not a big deal' .... cut to 29, and I’m like, 'Oh my God, <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-on-fame-activism-little-women">I feel so stressed and anxious</a>.' And I realise it’s because there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around.”</p>

      <p>She continued:</p>
      <blockquote>“If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or you’re still figuring things out … There’s just this incredible amount of anxiety.”</blockquote>
      <p>It would seem that no matter how far we’ve come, the pressure to couple up by a certain age is still there. Statistics from eHarmony reveal that 81% of singles in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties feel pushed into settling down. "With [these stats] in mind, we need to support our single friends and relatives and stop stigmatising their experiences," says relationship expert Rachael Lloyd. "To echo Emma Watson’s sentiments – independence is an individual choice and you can find happiness and fulfilment without rushing into a hasty relationship."</p>
      <p>Watson continues to be a pretty inspirational gal and you can catch her alongside equally phenomenal women, Meryl Streep, Saoirse Ronan, and Laura Dern, in<i> Little Women</i>, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09ld2ht/broadcasts/2017/12">which airs Dec. 26-28 at 8.30 p.m. on BBC One</a>.</p>
