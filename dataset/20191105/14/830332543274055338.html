      <h1>NBA releases streaming service for live games, shows</h1>
      <h2>Service costs $6.99 a month</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - Basketball is shooting for more subscription revenue.</p>
      <p>The National Basketball Association is launching a streaming service on Tuesday that lets people pay a monthly or annual fee to access more than 100 live NBA games, past programming, and original shows.</p>
      <p>The subscription service is a direct-to-consumer version of NBA TV, the television channel managed by the NBA and Turner Sports, which like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.</p>
      <p>In addition to live games, subscribers to NBA TV will have access to programming like pregame show "The Warm Up," nightly show "NBA Crunchtime" and weekly franchise "Shaqtin' A Fool." The app will also offer old games, including NBA Finals games from 2000 to 2019.</p>
      <p>NBA TV costs $6.99 per month or $59.99 per year. The app is accessible on connected devices like Roku and Apple TV and mobile devices. The service is also available on NBA.com for viewing on a web browser. People who pay for cable can access the app's content by signing in through their pay TV provider.</p>
      <p>Streaming news blog <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/nba-tv-is-now-available-ott-as-part-of-nbas-new-digital-offers">The Streamable</a> first reported on the new service after it soft launched at the start of this year's NBA season.</p>
      <p>The NBA's offering follows a series of developments by legacy broadcasters, including sports leagues, to expand digitally and appeal to cord-cutters. The NFL Network launched a $4.99-per-month subscription version of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/media/nfl-ratings-analysis/index.html">NFL RedZone</a> last year, though the content is only available on mobile. MLB offers <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/04/02/media/espn-plus-launch-date/index.html">MLB.TV</a> for $25 per month. Though, some cord-cutters, such as YouTube TV subscribers, already have the NBA TV channel.</p>
      <p>"NBA TV is the ultimate destination for around-the-clock access to premium NBA games and programming," Chris Benyarko, the NBA's senior vice president, direct to consumer, said in a statement. "We are thrilled to offer more ways than ever to access NBA TV and provide a preview of the future live game viewing experience."</p>
      <p>NBA TV's price point makes it competitive with the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/18/media/streaming-wars-scorecard/index.html">increasing number of subscription services</a> vying for consumers' limited time and money. Apple TV+ launched last week with its own lineup of original shows, while Disney+ is launching on November 12.</p>
      <p>This product isn't the NBA's first foray into subscription services. The NBA League Pass, offering hundreds of live games, costs $199.99 per year.</p>
