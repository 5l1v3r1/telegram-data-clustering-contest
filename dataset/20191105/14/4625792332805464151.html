      <p>One of Jimmy Fallon's <i>Tonight Show</i> producers is reportedly ditching the program amid plunging ratings in hopes of joining a 2020 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Executive producer Jim Bell, who has a Harvard degree in political science and government, is leaving the late-night show on Thursday and is in talks to join a 2020 Democrat's campaign, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/04/outgoing-jimmy-fallon-producer-jim-bell-hoping-to-join-presidential-campaign">according to</a> Page Six. Bell has pitched himself to several Democratic hopefuls about a role most likely centering on creating media content and messaging, but it is unclear whose campaign may pick him up.</p>
      <p>Rumors swirled in May that Bell had clashed with NBC producer Lorne Michaels, but sources told Page Six that "Lorne had absolutely nothing to do with Bell’s departure."</p>
      <p>While he has worked with the network for several years, including for <i>Today</i>, Bell has spent just one year with Fallon's program, which has continued trail behind other late-night shows such as those of CBS's Stephen Colbert and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel in ratings.</p>
      <p>"The past year with Jimmy and the terrific team at the show has been a blast," Bell said in a statement. He added that he has a “strong desire to delve into something new … so I can broaden and deepen my leadership role in the content universe.”</p>
      <p>Fallon has used his show to take aim at President Trump on numerous occasions and the pair have traded jabs back and forth.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, Fallon indicated he regrets a 2016 interview in which he ruffled the then-presidential candidate's hair. Trump, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-slams-jimmy-fallon-for-not-being-a-man-after-hair-interview">in turn, slammed</a> the "whimpering" host and told him to "be a man." Fallon <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jimmy-fallon-response-trump-tweet">responded on his show</a> by poking fun at first lady Melania Trump's anti-bullying campaign and pointing to the president as proof that it hasn't been effective.</p>
      <p>Around the same time, Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-roasts-no-talent-jimmy-fallon-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel">bashed Fallon and his fellow late-night hosts</a> as having "no talent."</p>
