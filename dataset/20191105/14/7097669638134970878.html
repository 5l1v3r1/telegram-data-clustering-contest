      <h1>Democrat Castro to fire staff in two states to focus on Iowa, Nevada</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Julian Castro will fire his campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina to focus on the other early voting states of Iowa and Nevada, a person familiar with the campaign's plans said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The employees were notified on Monday and will cease their work next week, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity. Politico news outlet first reported the move.</p>
      <p>The former U.S. housing secretary, who was also San Antonio mayor, has struggled to raise money in his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination to face Republican Donald Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>He issued a fundraising appeal to supporters in late October, saying his campaign needed $800,000 to stay in the race as the large Democratic field of candidates begins to narrow before the first presidential nominating contests in February.</p>
      <p>Rival Democrat Kamala Harris last week announced her campaign was trimming staff and restructuring to focus more on a make-or-break effort in the kickoff nominating contest in Iowa.</p>
      <p>Castro may be hoping to appeal to voters who had supported the other Texan in the Democratic race, former U.S. Representative Beto O'Rourke, who dropped out last week.</p>
      <p>Politico said Castro had invested $50,000 in a television advertisement that will start airing in Iowa on Tuesday morning.</p>
