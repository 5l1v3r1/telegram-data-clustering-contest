      <h2>Report recommends creating office to advocate for climate change action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/katya-slepian/" target="_blank">Katya Slepian</a></address>
      <p>The fossil fuel industry’s lobbying transcends governments and is more common than that of other groups, a new report from the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives suggests.</p>
      <p>The report, released Tuesday by the left-leaning Ottawa-based think tank, looked at lobbying of the federal government by the fossil fuels field between 2o11 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Nicolas Graham, co-author and University of Victoria lecturer, said the time range helped researchers compare the lobbying of government under two different prime ministers: Conservative Stephen Harper and Liberal Justin Trudeau.</p>
      <p>Oil and gas lobbyists focused on elected officials more under Harper, and more on senior public servants or mid-level staff when Trudeau was in office.</p>
      <p>Graham said that could be because a Conservative government is typically more sympathetic to oil and gas interests.</p>
      <p>“The main people to be targeted are people who are seen as allies or closely on board, or people who are potentially fence-sitting.”</p>
      <p>When the Liberals took over, the oil and gas lobby continued targeting bureaucrats with whom it already had a connection, he said.</p>
      <p>The report was part of the Corporate Mapping Project, which looks at the fossil fuel industry’s influence and compares it to three other industries – automotive industry, forestry and renewable energy – as well as to environmental groups.</p>
      <p>“We did find that the fossil fuel industry was the far most active lobbyist,” he said, adding that organization calling for action on climate change were lobbying five times less.</p>
      <p>“It is a very powerful economic sector,” he said. “There are also really high stakes for [that] industry at this point in time, around climate action questions, so they’re particularly active in lobbying.”</p>
      <p>The current federal lobbyist’s registry is a good first step, he added, but it could be better if it had more information, such as finances and what’s discussed at meetings.</p>
      <p>“We think that shining a light on lobbying a little bit more could be a way of limiting corporate influence and limiting the sense of backroom dealing.”</p>
      <p>A watchdog-type model could help level the playing field, he suggested, and address how the system favours corporations.</p>
