      <h1>Leeds identify on-loan Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah's return date after injury</h1>
      <h2>Nketiah missed Leeds' win over QPR with a stomach injury suffered in training on the eve of the game</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:20:51+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:20</time> by <a rel="author">David Anderson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-anderson/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds</a> hope Eddie Nketiah will be back in action before the end of the month after the hitman was ruled out with a stomach injury.</p>
      <p>Nketiah could be missing for three weeks with the abdominal problem he suffered in training on the eve of Leeds’ win over QPR.</p>
      <p>Leeds are not putting an exact timescale on how long the on-loan <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> striker will be absent and hope he will return before November finishes.</p>
      <p>In addition to the victory over QPR, Nketiah is also expected to miss Saturday’s clash with Blackburn and the trips to Luton and Reading.</p>
      <p>Leeds hope he may be back for their match against Middlesbrough on November 30 at Elland Road.</p>

      <p>Nketiah’s loss is a blow to Leeds’ promotion bid and the 20-year-old is their top scorer with five goals from his 12 appearances for the Yorkshire outfit.</p>
      <p>Leeds are struggling for goals this season and have netted just 19 times in their 15 league games.</p>
      <p>They are particularly goal shy at Elland Road and have managed just seven in their seven home matches.</p>
      <p>Fans have big hopes for Nketiah and were desperate to see him start in the Championship because all 10 of his appearances have come from the bench.</p>

      <p>Coach Marcelo Bielsa has resisted the growing clamour from the stands to stand him, preferring Patrick Bamford up front.</p>
      <p>Nketiah was pushing hard for his first league start before his injury and scored a hat-trick for England Under-21s in their Euro 2021 qualifying win over Austria last month</p>
