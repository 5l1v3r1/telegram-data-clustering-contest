      <h2>Inside the treatments and tactics Pride of Britain host Carol Vorderman employs to keep her face and body in tip top shape</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:51:54+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Frances Kindon</a></address>
      <p>With her glowing complexion and enviable figure, Carol Vorderman is as stunning now as she was when she first found fame on Channel 4's Countdown in 1982.</p>
      <p>Filling in for Lorraine Kelly on her ITV show today, fans were in awe of her smooth visage, with many asking what her secret is.</p>
      <p>And the star - who will present the The Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards tonight on ITV at 8pm - previously revealed she's a big fan of treatments such as plasma showers, which used ionised gas to strip bacteria from the skin and encourage the growth of new cells.</p>
      <p>She hasn't been under the knife but does have botox injections once a year in her neck and around her eyes.</p>
      <p>She also has derma roller treatment, whereby micro-needles are rolled across the skin to stimulate collagen.</p>

      <p>She also tackles her looks from the inside out, taking vitamins A and D, omega 3, fish oils, calcium, pro-biotics and cider vinegar.</p>
      <p>"And I eat well. I cut down on sugar and cut down on carbs long before it became fashionable, and most of the week I drink very little alcohol. Your tolerance goes down after the menopause. Two glasses of wine and I feel it the next day. But I do love to party!" she told the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>Then there's that sensational figure.</p>

      <p>To maintain her 25-inch waist, Carol - who hasn't weighed herself since 1999 - does a staggering 15,000 steps a day and hikes more than 50 miles a week.</p>
      <p>She also hits the gym three days out of seven and does three open-air circuit training sessions.</p>
      <p>"I’m probably about a size 8 to 9 at the moment. I’ve always had a small waist, I think I’m about 25 inches around my waist. If I put on a bit of weight, I know I have, and I go up to a size 11," she recently told Lorraine.</p>
      <p>"A larger size 10, that’s kind of my boundary for where I’m happy."</p>

      <p>As for her award-winning bottom - which won Rear of the Year in 2011 and 2014 and earned her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> comparisons - that, too, is hard-earned.</p>
      <p>"I promise I haven’t had bottom implants. It’s the same old bottom. In my family, loads of us have it: the Vorderman a**e... And I’ve been working out for decades, so the shape of mine is down to years of keeping fit," she told the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>To achieve her look, she does 20,000 squats a year and is a huge fan of 'goblet squats' with a kettle bell.</p>

      <p>Carol started using hormone replacement therapy three years ago and believes that has also changed the shape of her body, increasing her bust from a size 36 to a 38D.</p>
      <p>"I think your bust does grow with hormonal changes. And we all know you put on weight when your bust grows. You have babies; it grows. Then you go through the menopause - I had my last period about a year ago - and it grows a bit more," she added.</p>
