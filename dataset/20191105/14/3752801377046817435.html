      <h1>French arms dealer Thales approaches ConCourt for leave to appeal stay of prosecution</h1>

      <p>French arms dealer Thales has approached the highest court in South Africa to extricate itself from former president Jacob Zuma's criminal trial. </p>
      <p>Thales confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it approached the Constitutional Court on November 1 for leave to appeal a ruling by the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg dismissing its application for a permanent stay of prosecution.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Zuma filed his papers in the High Court on November 1, also seeking to appeal the court’s decision. </p>
      <p>On October 11, judges Thoba Poyo-Dlwati, Bhekisisa Mnguni and Esther Steyn dismissed both Zuma and Thales’ applications for a permanent stay of prosecution with costs. </p>
      <p>The court found that Zuma should be prosecuted for a corruption case that had been hanging over him for almost two decades, News24 earlier reported. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Zuma, however, in a lengthy notice of 48 points, argued the ruling was biased and aimed at assisting the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in violating his constitutional rights. </p>
      <p>The charges against Zuma, 16 in total, date back to 2005 relating to 783 payments he allegedly received in connection with the controversial arms deal. </p>
