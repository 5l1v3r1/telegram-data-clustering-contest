      <p>Ahead of <b>The World/Inferno Friendship Society</b>‘s annual Hallowmas show in Brooklyn, we premiered a stream of the band’s new <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/worldinferno-unearth-early-demos-for-limited-halloween-comp-stream-it/">demos collection</a> and mentioned they’d have a new album called <i>All Borders Are Porous to Cats</i> out on January 17 via Alternative Tentacles (<a href="https://alternativetentacles.com/product/all-borders-are-porous-to-cats/">pre-order</a>). Now they’ve released the first single off the album, “Freedom Is A Wilderness Made For You and Me,” which the band calls “New Romantic 2 Tone ska,” which is pretty much the perfect description of what this song sounds like. Listen for yourself below.</p>
      <p>World/Inferno have West Coast dates coming up this month, followed by NJ (Stanhope house on 12/7) and Long Island (Amityville Music Hall on 12/8) shows in December, and then a <b>New Year’s Eve</b> show in Brooklyn at <b>The Kingsland</b>. That also doubles as their album release show, and <b>Funkrust Brass Band</b> are opening. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nye-with-worldinferno-friendship-society-rec-releasefunkrust-brass-band-tickets-79775527751"><b>Tickets</b></a> for the NYE show are on sale now.
