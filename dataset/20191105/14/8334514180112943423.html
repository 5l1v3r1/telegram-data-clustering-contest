      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced a Jehovah’s Witness adherent on Tuesday to six years in jail on a charge of organizing an extremist group, said the Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes.</p>
      <p>Russia has targeted followers of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, a denomination of Christianity, since a 2017 ruling by the Supreme Court declared the group an extremist organization and ordered it to be disbanded.</p>
      <p>Sergey Klimov, 49, was head of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Siberian city of Tomsk, the Investigative Committee said in a statement.</p>
      <p>He is the eighth Jehovah’s Witness member to receive a prison sentence since the law came into effect, the group said. A total 284 adherents are under investigation, of whom 46 are in detention and 23 are under house arrest.</p>
      <p>Six Jehovah’s Witness followers were jailed in late September for extremism, receiving jail sentences of between two and three-and-a-half years, while a Danish builder, Dennis Christensen, was sentenced to six years in February.</p>
      <p>284 adherents are under investigation, with 46 being held in detention and 23 under house arrest</p>
      <p>The U.S.-headquartered Jehovah’s Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin.</p>
      <p>Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject.</p>
