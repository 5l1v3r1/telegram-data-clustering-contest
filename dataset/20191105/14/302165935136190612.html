      <p>FRANKFURT, Nov 5 — Adidas has revealed a new addition to its 4D range — the new reflective ALPHAEDGE 4D running shoe.</p>
      <p>ADIDAS 4D was first launched back in 2017 as part of FUTURECRAFT, a programme created by the brand to explore innovative new materials, technology, and craftsmanship in sportswear.</p>
      <p>The ALPHAEDGE 4D is now the latest addition to the collection, and has been printed using digital light projection and oxygen using Carbon Digital Light SynthesisTM technology from Silicon Valley-based company, Carbon. This technology enables adidas to print high-performance, durable polymeric products, which the brand says will eventually enable it to create personalised footwear based on specific sports and individual needs.</p>
      <p>Adidas has also used a reflective Primeknit fabric on the upper for a more striking design and increased visibility on dark winter days. Each thread of the knit is also individually constructed millimetre by millimetre with FORGEDMESH, a process which uses TPU-coated yarn and maximises performance when stitched at various angles and layers, producing a stronger but still flexible fabric. This seamless sock-like fit offers the support and comfort needed during running, particularly during any tight turns.</p>
      <p>Marco Kormann, Director Platform Innovation, adidas, commented on the launch saying, “We are proud to have taken a FUTURECRAFT concept and scaled it up significantly across our business within two years. ADIDAS 4D marks a shift in the way we approach the design and creation of our products. With the support of our partner, Carbon, we have shown the possibilities of data-driven-design and digital manufacturing on a global scale. The next iteration of the technology will be to develop how it can be used to produce footwear that is tailored to specific sports, and even individual athletes.”</p>
      <p>ALPHAEDGE 4D FW19 will be available globally across adidas.com, the adidas app and select retailers from November 11, 2019. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
