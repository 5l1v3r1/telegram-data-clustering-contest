      <p>Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko’s daughter Saumu Mbuvi has scolded women in relationships with married men.</p>
      <p>The businesswoman in an Instastories post lashed out at the women for getting involved with these men. She referred to the behavior as “stupid.”</p>
      <p>“Ladies no offense but the highest form of stupidity, is a single woman being loyal to a married man,” she wrote.</p>

      <p>The mother of one is said to be involved with Lamu senator Anwar Loitiptip who apparently is a married man. He has on his part denied these allegations.</p>
      <p>In September, Saumu was embroiled in a nasty social media spat with a woman who accused the legislator of using and dumping her.</p>

      <p>Hanifa Were told reporters that she is with child following a one night stand with the first time lawmaker.</p>
      <p>“He never got in touch with me again. After three weeks, I started feeling unwell and when I took a test, I found out I was pregnant,” she narrated.</p>
      <p>Ms Were took the fight a notch higher by taunting an outspoken Saumu.</p>
      <p>In one post seen by <i>Kahawa Tungu</i>, Were who goes by the username Hanny Fyn says, “Tena sana…nangoja leo saumu anistaki akiniface nitajua kweli anapenda mbilikimo mwenzake.”</p>
      <p>In another post, she refers to Loitiptip as a philanderer who “confused” her into getting pregnant.</p>
      <p>“Oooh mayoo my shitombi wacha tungoje harusi.”</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether the three have since settled their differences.</p>
