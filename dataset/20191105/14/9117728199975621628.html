        <b>Mercedes have opted for a more conservative tyre approach for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix next weekend, as they look for their third victory in a row.</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the weekend, we saw another (nearly!) tyre masterclass from Lewis Hamilton, as he went for the one-stop strategy as opposed to Valtteri Bottas (eventual race-winner) and Max Verstappen (third-place), who were both on two-stop strategies.</p>
      <p>It's the penultimate race of the season next weekend in Brazil and Mercedes (and McLaren) have both opted to take just eight sets of the C3 softs.</p>
      <p>However, the likes of Ferrari, Red Bull, Haas, Renault and Racing Point will all take the full sets of the red-banded rubber compounds, bringing 10 to Interlagos, with Williams, Alfa Romeo and Toro Rosso all taking nine sets of the soft.</p>
