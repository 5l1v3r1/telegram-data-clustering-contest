      <h2>As the roles are being handed out to budding Marys, Josephs and Gabriels across the land, new figures show the part we played can say quite a lot about where we end up late in life - and starring isn't always the best bet</h2>

      <p>Adults who played one of the oxen in their primary school nativity play end up earning more as adults than any of the rest of the cast.</p>
      <p>That's according to new research that asked people some basic questions about their life - along with which part they had in the festive classic.</p>
      <p>Brits who played the part of an ox now earn a cool £43,000 a year on average, more than double what people who played a sheep or a lamb now make, figures from Virgin Media show.</p>
      <p>But while cattle aren't low-earning, it was Marys who ended up with the most social media followers, while narrators were most likely to get jobs as teachers.</p>

      <p>The study found Marys were also most likely to be content in their adult life, with 92% of people who took the lead female role saying they are now happy with their lot. Josephs followed soon after, with 91% happy where they ended up.</p>
      <p>There was also worrying signs of inequality among the heavenly horde, with former angels earning an average of £25,000 as adults but Gabriels making far, far more at £40,000 each.</p>
      <p>And beating classmates to the prime parts isn't something we forget, either.</p>
      <p>Some 22% said their role made them feel proud, one in five said it gave them confidence and 7% said starring in the play changed their life. </p>
      <p>Being passed over for the role of donkey isn't something we forget quickly, either.</p>
      <p>While one in three said they were happy to hide in the chorus as they would have hated the attention, 9% admitted to wishing one of the stars fell ill so they could step in and the same number said missing out meant they never acted again.</p>
