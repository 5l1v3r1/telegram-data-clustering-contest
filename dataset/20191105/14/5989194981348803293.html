        <b>Women from Srebrenica gathered outside the Swedish embassy in Sarajevo on Tuesday to protest the controversial award of the Nobel Literature Prize to Austrian writer Peter Handke.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The women from the site of the worst massacre during Yugoslavia's bloody collapse, accused Handke of being a Serb apologist during the 1990s wars.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thelocal.se/tag/nobel+prize+2019">The Swedish Academy's pick last month</a> triggered outrage in the Balkans and beyond because of Handke's admiration for late Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s, the Austrian writer emerged as a vocal defender of Serbs as Yugoslavia broke apart.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday several dozen women gathered in protest outside Stockholm's embassy in Sarajevo, where Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria and her husband Prince Daniel are currently paying a visit.</p>
      <p>The women plan to protest weekly until the Nobel ceremony on December 10th when Handke, 76, will receive his prize.</p>
      <p>Some women held up photos of the writer from a personal visit he made to Srebrenica, the hamlet where some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered by Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995.</p>
      <p>The novellist is seen standing in front of a sign at the entrance to the town, less htan a year after the killings, according to the women.</p>
      <p>The group also gave the Swedish ambassador a letter for the king and queen, asking them to "prevent the shame, not only of the Swedish people", but also "shame of civilization".</p>
      <p>"We do not agree with awarding of the prize to someone who supported crimes and genocide," Munira Subasic, president of the association of mothers of victims from Srebrenica, told reporters.</p>
      <p>"The Nobel Prize for Handke is a vote in support of our humiliation" by genocide deniers, the letter said.</p>
      <p>In 1997 Handke was accused of minimizing Serb war crimes in his book A Journey to the Rivers: Justice for Serbia.</p>
      <p>He also drew criticism for speaking at the 2006 funeral of Milosevic who died awaiting trial for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
