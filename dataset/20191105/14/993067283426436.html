      <p>The world’s oldest working post office has been put up for sale with a £275,000 price tag.</p>
      <p>Sanquhar Post Office in Dumfries and Galloway opened in 1712, eight years before the second oldest one in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
      <p>It comes with a three-bedroom cottage, a courtyard and some outbuildings that were originally the home of the Mail Coaches Horses, according to the estate agent listing.</p>
      <blockquote>I hope someone will come along and buy it and keep it going because this is Scotland's heritage and more particularly Sanquhar's<cite>Seller Nazra Alam</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Current owners Nazra Alam, 67, and her husband Dr Manzoor Alam, 77, took over the business in 2015 but have now put it on the market as they are retiring.</p>
      <p>They are hopeful someone will buy the property and save the post office from closing after more than 300 years in operation.</p>
      <p>Mrs Alam said: “I hope someone will come along and buy it and keep it going because this is Scotland’s heritage and more particularly Sanquhar’s.</p>
      <p>“The post office has been in operation since 1712 so it would be a shame to have to shut it down.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of the community, we offer full postal services, banking and we’ve got stationery and a gift section.”</p>

      <p>The mother-of-two added: “I’ve enjoyed every moment of running it.</p>
      <p>“The last five years has been a remarkable journey and I’ve enjoyed it, it’s a nice area and nice people and we have visitors from all over the world.”</p>
      <p>The post office is recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest one in operation.</p>
      <p>The second oldest, located in Stockholm, opened in 1720 while the third, in Santiago, Chile, opened in 1772.</p>
      <p>A Post Office spokesman said: “We are proud of the heritage of Sanquhar Post Office and are committed to preserving it into the future.</p>
      <p>“Post Office will be working with the local community to try to find a new postmaster to take on the branch and ensure it remains part of the Post Office network and Sanquhar’s unique place in postal history is retained.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime, the branch remains open for business as usual.”</p>
