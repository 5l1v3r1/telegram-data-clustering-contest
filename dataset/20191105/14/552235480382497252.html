      <p>An aggressive Airdrie man who frightened petrol station staff with his “bizarre” behaviour has narrowly avoided a prison sentence.</p>
      <p>Mark O’Brian was holding a fire extinguisher and a rock as he yelled abuse at two employees at Peggy White’s garage in Newhouse.</p>
      <p>O’Brian, 33, of St Andrew’s Gardens, appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court last week.</p>
      <p>He admitted threatening or abusive behaviour which caused staff fear and alarm on September 29.</p>
      <p>O’Brian also owned up to throwing an apple which struck one employee on the face and throwing the rock which hit him on the body.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Diarmid Bruce said his client has had psychiatric treatment in the past and suffers from “episodes” which results in “bizarre behaviour on his part”.</p>

      <p>Mr Bruce added: “On this occasion he had been drinking.</p>
      <p>“He says he has not had a drink since; he certainly appears contrite.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Allan McKay told O’Brian: “Given the terms of the criminal justice social work report, and on a margin, I’m prepared to make a community payback order as an alternative to custody.”</p>
      <p>O’Brian will be under supervision for a year and must attend counselling as directed by his social worker.</p>
      <p>He was also ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid community work within six months.</p>
