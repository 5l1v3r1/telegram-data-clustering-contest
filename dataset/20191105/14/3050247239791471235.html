      <h1>Peter Schiff: China's Gold-Backed Crypto Would Be Bearish for Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T14:39:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/china">China</a> launching a digital counterpart of the yuan backed by <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/gold">gold</a> puts Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) at a disadvantage, veteran gold bug <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/peter-schiff">Peter Schiff</a> claims. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1190391860541435904">tweet</a> on Nov. 2, Schiff, notorious for his <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-will-never-hit-50k-gold-bug-peter-schiff-tells-tom-lee">cynicism</a> when it comes to Bitcoin, attempted to counter criticism of his stance by Keiser report host, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/max-keiser">Max Keiser</a>. </p>
      <h3>Schiff tells Keiser: gold backing beats BTC</h3>
      <p>“According to @maxkeiser I'm an idiot because I think #gold is better money than #Bitcoin,” he wrote. </p>
      <p>Schiff also repeated his oft-quoted idea that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value: </p>
      <blockquote>“He also claims China is about to launch a crypto currency backed by gold. This is bullish for gold and bearish for Bitcoin. A crypto backed by gold is much better than one backed by nothing!”</blockquote>
      <p>Keiser did not respond publicly, having kept a markedly low profile on social media throughout October.</p>
      <h3>Official hints at gold role</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-to-be-first-to-launch-digital-currency-says-think-tank-exec">reported</a>, China appears to be advancing efforts to issue a digital currency in the wake of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/facebook">Facebook’s</a> own token, Libra. </p>
      <p>Its backing remains uncertain, with an ex-Congress official last month <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/blockchain/roll/2019-10-28/doc-iicezuev5447326.shtml">suggesting</a> it would come in the form of a peg to China’s gold reserve among other factors. </p>
      <p>China’s recent <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-wechat-searches-for-blockchain-and-a-share-stocks-skyrocket">endorsement</a> of blockchain technology meanwhile appeared to have an instant positive impact on Bitcoin markets. Nonetheless, local media subsequently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-warns-against-cryptocurrency-speculation-amid-blockchain-hype">tempered</a> the hype, advising citizens not to take the support as proof of a change of stance regarding cryptocurrency. </p>
      <p>Beijing outlawed cryptocurrency trading in September 2017, a situation which officially remains the same despite rumors that investors are using <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/alipay-denounces-bitcoin-otc-trading-regulatory-gray-area-in-china">different on-ramps</a> to gain access.</p>
