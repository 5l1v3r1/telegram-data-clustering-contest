      <p>Madrid - World No 1 <b>Rafael Nadal</b>, recovering from injury, confirmed on Tuesday he will compete at the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London from November 10-17.</p>
      <p><b><i>"Yesterday I had an MRI in Majorca and despite a slight strain to the left abdominal muscle I will go to London,"</i></b> tweeted Nadal, forced out of last week's Paris Masters by the same injury.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>"Thursday or Friday I will start hitting services. The idea is to play the ATP Finals. Thanks for your support."</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Nadal took over as world No 1 this week from Novak Djokovic who went on to win the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>The eight top-ranked players in the world gather in London for the ATP Tour Finals where Nadal's world No 1 ranking will be under threat from Djokovic.</p>
      <p>The Serb would be sure of reclaiming the year-end top ranking should he win the tournament and Nadal fail to reach the semis.</p>
      <p>If Nadal fails to win even one round robin match, Djokovic could be crowned world No 1 simply by reaching the final after two group-stage wins.</p>
