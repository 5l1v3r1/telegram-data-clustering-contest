      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): No thanks to lower average selling price and increase in packaging and fuel costs, Hartalega Holdings Bhd experienced a 13% drop in its net profit to RM103.87 million in its second financial quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (2QFY20), from RM120.22 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>The lower average selling price dragged the group’s quarterly revenue marginally lower to RM709.42 million, from RM714.24 million in 2QFY19, the nitrile glove manufacturer’s exchange filing today showed.</p>
      <p>Despite lower profitability, Hartalega’s board declared its first interim single-tier dividend of 1.8 sen per share in respect of the financial year ending June 30, 2020 (FY20). The dividend is payable on Dec 27.</p>
      <p>For the first half of FY20 (1HFY20), Hartalega’s net profit came lower at RM197.93 million, down by 19% compared with RM245.09 million in the same period a year ago. Cumulative revenue, meanwhile, dropped 5.3% at RM1.35 billion, against RM1.42 billion in 2HFY19.</p>
      <p>Hartalega in its filing said the group will continue with its next-generation complex (NGC) capacity expansion plans, in line with growing global rubber glove demand, besides taking steps to address rising operating cost.</p>
      <p>Shares of Hartalega closed seven sen or 1.26% lower today at RM5.47, bringing a market capitalisation of RM18.45 billion. The stock has fallen 10.9% or 67 sen year-to-date.</p>
