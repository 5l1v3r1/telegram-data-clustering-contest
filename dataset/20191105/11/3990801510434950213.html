      <h1>Porcelain business raises suspicion amid China’s blockchain renaissance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:45:39+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:45</time> by <a rel="author">Yessi Bello Perez</a></address>
      <p>A porcelain and education business has attracted the suspicion of Chinese regulators after its stock recently boomed, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-regulator-investigates-companys-blockchain-pivot-amid-stock-surge">CoinDesk reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Guangdong Great Wall Group’s stock price rose for five consecutive days after Chinese President <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/28/moonday-morning-china-goes-crazy-over-blockchain/">Xi Jinping encouraged</a> civilians to embrace blockchain technology — and is now under investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).</p>
      <p>Founded in 1996, Great Wall Group started off as a creative porcelain business. However, <a href="http://www.szse.cn/disclosure/listed/bulletinDetail/index.html?4af73164-c033-4e71-bd9a-cf5608499d41">its 2018 annual report</a>, featured details about six blockchain projects.</p>
      <p>Investigators are keen to find out whether the company‘s blockchain drive is indeed genuine.</p>
      <p>“According to the Securities Law of the People’s Republic of China, the committee of CSRC has decided to open an investigation against the firm,” the filing reads.</p>
      <h3>Chinese authorities are right to be concerned</h3>
      <p>In August last year, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/08/02/sec-cryptocurrency-blockchain-subpoena/">Hard Fork reported</a> on how Long Island Tea Corp changed its name to Long Blockchain Corp. Although it may have seemed like a minor change at the time, it caused the company‘s share price to rise from $5 million to almost $70 million in a matter of days.</p>
      <p>This prompted the US Securities and Exchange Commission to serve it with a subpoena.</p>
      <p>It’s an interesting time for China, as the country is gearing up to<a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/28/chinas-tech-race-with-the-us-heats-up-as-it-readies-to-launch-its-digital-currency/"> launch its own digital currency</a> as Facebook‘s <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/10/24/zuckerberg-tells-congress-hell-delay-cryptocurrency-libra-until-regulatory-issues-are-sorted-yeah-right/">struggles to convince regulators</a> that its controversial ‘cryptocurrency’ Libra is both safe and necessary.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, regulators are right to look into companies purportedly using the technology — better to be safe than sorry!</p>
