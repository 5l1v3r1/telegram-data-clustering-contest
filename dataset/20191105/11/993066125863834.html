      <p>Emily Maitlis has said her “heart goes out” to colleague Samira Ahmed during her employment tribunal.</p>
      <p>The Newsnight presenter voiced her support for the Newswatch host, who is pursuing an equal pay complaint against the BBC.</p>
      <p>Maitlis said the issue of pay equality is not confined to the BBC and is an international problem.</p>

      <p>Ahmed claimed during her tribunal that she was paid “a sixth” of what Jeremy Vine earned while he was presenting Points Of View.</p>
      <p>Maitlis, speaking on Good Morning Britain, said salary issues are not limited to Vine, or the much-discussed earnings of Gary Lineker, and that broader injustices should be tackled.</p>
      <p>She said: “As somebody who’s been in a similar position, my heart goes out to her.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s a really important thing that she’s doing, fighting for other people who’ve got unjust and unequal imbalances.”</p>
      <p>She added: “Presumably it is a nationwide or an international problem that we’re all trying to understand and get to grips with, and whether we need more transparency or not is clearly the big issue.”</p>

      <p>Maitlis said Ahmed would not have chosen to take her complaint to a tribunal immediately, and believes broadcasters need to look at equalising the pay between those deemed entertainers and those involved in news.</p>
      <p>The Newsnight host said: “I don’t think it’s a Jeremy Vine problem. I think, from what I understand, Samira has gone to a tribunal – anyone who goes to a tribunal does not do so willingly.</p>
      <p>“They don’t do it because it’s their first recourse. They do it because they’ve tried everything else and it hasn’t worked.</p>
      <p>“I do think one of the things that’s thrown up is the difference between news and entertainment.</p>
      <p>“It would be nice to have those two recognised equally.”</p>
      <p>She added: “The Gary Lineker thing is very different because you have been an expert in your field.”</p>
      <p>Maitlis’s book, Airhead: The Imperfect Art Of Making News, is being adapted into a TV series, but she does not yet know which actress will take the starring role.</p>
      <p>Asked who she would prefer to play her, Maitlis said: “I love Carey Mulligan, I love Jessie Buckley.”</p>
