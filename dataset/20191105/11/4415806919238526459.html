      <h1>'This is simply obscene': 679 patients waiting on trolleys in Irish hospitals, highest figure of 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:53:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/steve-neville/" target="_blank">By Steve Neville</a></address>
      <p>There are 679 patients waiting on trolleys in Irish hospitals today, the highest figure of the year so far.</p>
      <p>The INMO's Trolley Watch figures found that 481 patients are waiting for beds in the emergency department with 198 waiting in wards elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The figure is the second-highest ever recorded.</p>
      <p>The worst-affected hospitals include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>University Hospital Limerick: 63</li>
        <li>University Hospital Cork: 60</li>
        <li>Letterkenny University Hospital: 47</li>
        <li>South Tipperary General Hospital: 40</li>
        <li>Sligo University Hospital: 39</li>
        <li>University Hospital Waterford: 39</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Phil Ní Sheaghdha, INMO General Secretary, said the numbers were "simply obscene".</p>
      <p>"Winter has not even started, and Irish hospitals are overwhelmed. Our members are faced with an inhumane working environment, while patients are put at ever-increasing risk.</p>
      <p>"50,000 people marched to support nurses and midwives during the strike. They did so for an end to short staffing and a better health service.</p>
      <p>"The government’s delay in implementing the strike settlement, along with the recruitment freeze, has driven more nurses and midwives out of the public health service.</p>
      <p>"It’s time for extra emergency staffing, an end to the recruitment ban, and for hospitals to curtail services until safe patient and staff levels are reached."</p>
      <p>The INMO highlighted South Tipperary General as a hospital in crisis.</p>
      <p>They say that despite it being one of the country’s smaller hospitals, it has more patients on trolleys than some of the largest.</p>
      <p>The 679 patients waiting on trolleys is up on <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/nearly-600-patients-waiting-for-beds-in-irish-hospitals-961693.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">yesterday's figure</a> which stood at 595.</p>
      <p>Last week, the INMO stated that last month was the worst-ever October for overcrowding and the second-worst month since records began.</p>
      <p>There were <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/11452-on-trolleys-inmo-warns-of-risks-following-worst-ever-october-for-overcrowding-960867.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">11,452 patients on trolleys in Irish hospitals over the course of the month</a>.</p>
      <p>They warned that due to the overcrowding and "chronic understaffing" patients are at "grave risk".</p>
