      <h1>UPDATE | Jacob Zuma calls in sick for state capture inquiry on Monday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:09:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jeanette Chabalala</a></address>
      <p>Former president Jacob Zuma will no longer appear before the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture on Monday. </p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Tuesday afternoon, the commission said: "The Commission has been informed by the legal representatives of the former President, Mr JG Zuma, that he is ill and unable to attend the hearings scheduled for 11-15 November 2019."  </p>
      <p>"Dates for further hearings will be communicated in due course," the commission said.</p>
      <p>Zuma first appeared before commission chairperson, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, in July.</p>
      <p>He previously told the commission that Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) council chairperson, General Siphiwe Nyanda, and Ngoako Ramatlhodi were spies, News24 earlier reported.</p>
      <p>Both men hit back, with Ramatlhodi challenging Zuma to a lie detector test and Nyanda saying he would consider cross-examining Zuma at the commission.</p>
      <p>The commission has also announced that Lord Peter Hain would appear on November 18.</p>
      <p>"Lord Hain has volunteered to give evidence before the commission," the statement read.</p>
      <p>Hain, who was born in South Africa, is a former UK Labour party Cabinet minister.</p>
      <p>He has written to the UK's finance minister, Sajid Javid, to follow the US' lead and impose a series of debilitating sanctions against the controversial Gupta family, according to <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/british-finance-secretary-asked-to-impose-us-style-sanctions-on-the-guptas-20191011">News24.</a></p>
      <p>Last month, the US Treasury announced that the three Gupta brothers – Ajay, Atul and Tony – as well family lieutenant Salim Essa, have been blocked from transacting, doing business or engaging in any financial dealings with any US entity or person.</p>
