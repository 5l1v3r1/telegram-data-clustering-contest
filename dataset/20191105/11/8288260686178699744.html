      <h2>The fire tore through the HGV near Coventry in the early hours of November 5. Part of the southbound carriageway remains shut.</h2>

      <p>This is what remains of the lorry that sparked a lengthy closure of the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/m6">M6</a> - after it was torn apart in an overnight inferno.</p>
      <p>The HGV - carrying hazardous materials - was gutted in the blaze which rocked the southbound carriageway, between J1 (Rugby) and J2 (Coventry).</p>
      <p>The fire tore through the lorry at around 3am on November 5 and led to the closure of both the north and southbound stretches of motorway.</p>
      <p>As of midday, northbound had reopened but southbound remained shut and is expected to stay so 'for some time'.</p>

      <p>Highways England tweeted: "M6 southbound J2 to J1 is closed due to an earlier lorry fire that was carrying a hazardous substance.</p>
      <p>"Specialist teams are on the scene removing the contents of the lorry safely.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"There are delays of 15 minutes approaching J2."</p>
      <p>Images showed the charred shell of the lorry on the hard shoulder, with drums of hazardous materials and debris littering the road.</p>

      <p>Warwickshire Fire and Rescue sent appliances from Bedworth, Nuneaton and a water bowser from Coleshill.</p>
      <p>The fire service remain on scene managing the incident, but the blaze continues to have a huge knock-on effect on surrounding roads.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Delays of around 15 minutes remain and congestion is spanning several miles.</p>
      <p>A Highways England spokesman said: "The M6 in Warwickshire is closed southbound between J2 and J1 due to a HGV trailer fire.</p>

      <p>"Warwickshire Fire and Rescue are on scene managing the incident.</p>
      <p>"There are delays of at least 15 minutes above usual journey times on the southbound carriageway between J3 (Bedworth) and J2, with congestion spanning several miles.</p>
      <p>"The lorry involved was carrying a hazardous substance, due to this specialist teams are in attendance to ensure the contents are removed safely.</p>
      <p>"For traffic approaching the delays locally, you are advised to expect disruption with extra journey time and you may wish to re-route or delay your journey.</p>
      <p>"Road users are advised to follow the 'Hollow Triangle' diversion route."</p>
