      <p>Sports radio broadcasting great Kevin Harlan had some fun Monday night when a black cat invaded MetLife Stadium during the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a>’ game against the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a>.</p>
      <p>The cat was spotted at midfield toward the end of the second quarter. Referees stopped play for about 2 minutes before the cat cleared the field.</p>

      <p>While fans at the stadium and on social media were mystified by the feline, Harlan made sure the radio audience got the full dramatic experience.</p>
      <p>Harlan called the cat’s invasion as if the animal was running a football into the end zone. He even threw in a sponsor during his broadcast call. He also likened the cat’s elusiveness to star running backs <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/saquon-barkley">Saquon Barkley</a>, of the Giants, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/ezekiel-elliott">Ezekiel Elliott</a>, of the Cowboys.</p>

      <p>At this point of the game, the Giants were leading 9-3. The cat left the field and New York’s hopes and dreams went with it, it seemed.</p>

      <p>New York would allow 10 points in the quarter to end the half down 13-12. Dallas then outscored the Giants 24-6 in the second half and won the game 37-18.</p>
      <p>Giants safety Jabrill Peppers knew something would go awry once he saw that cat.</p>

      <p>“I ain’t superstitious or nothing but any time I saw a black cat or it went across me growing up, something bad happened,” Peppers said, according to the New York Post. “I kinda grew out of it now, but I still don’t like ’em. I wasn’t gonna go out there and get it.”</p>
