      <p>She said about the reunion: "There's nothing I can share, but I'm staying optimistic about it all. I'd definitely be up for it. I'm a mum of three now, so getting back up on stage would be a lovely thing to share with them. The first time I was on stage with the Pussycat Dolls was the most empowering moment of my life. To live in that space again and show my children what that means to be would be a dream."</p>
      <p>While speaking about the rumours to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1079285/nicole-scherzinger-reacts-to-those-pussycat-dolls-reunion-rumors"><b>E!

      <p>However she added: "But I can't confirm anything right now. Because I'm so busy, I'm doing three different shows on three different continents."</p>
