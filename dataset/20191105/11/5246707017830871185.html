      <p>Seemingly being made up of a mix of different genres, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balthazars_dream"><b>Balthazar's Dream</b></a> is just days away from launching on Nintendo Switch. The best news? You play the whole thing as a dog.</p>
      <p>The game follows the story of Dustin, a boy who goes into a coma after a tragic incident. His injuries are serious, but his faithful dog Balthazar remains by his side, lying and sleeping alongside him at all times. One day, though, Balthazar has a dream where he senses the presence of two entities. He recognises one as Dustin, but the other presence lurks menacingly in the darkness; Balthazar is sure that it is here to take Dustin away.</p>
      <p>And so, our dog protagonist em-<i>barks (ahem)</i> on a quest to save his owner, making his way through all sorts of dreamy landscapes containing platforming, adventure, and even shooter gameplay sections. Here's a quick feature list to tell you a little more:</p>
      <blockquote>FEATURES<br/>• 10 levels<br/>• 3 dogfights with bosses<br/>• 5 different dog breeds to play with<br/>• Launching your dog into space<br/>• Emotional soundtrack<br/>• Challenging platformer segments</blockquote>
