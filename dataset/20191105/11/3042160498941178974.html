      <h1>‘Rodney Reed is Innocent’: Attorney Calls for Mass Showing at Texas Governor’s Mansion to Fight Execution of Man Believed to be Wrongfully Convicted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:33:18+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://atlantablackstar.com/author/laurenf/" target="_blank">Lauren Floyd</a></address>
      <p>Rapper <b><a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/tag/meek-mill/">Meek Mill</a></b> joins a host of celebrities and others fighting to save the life of a Black man facing execution this month in a murder even the victim’s family reportedly believes he is innocent of.</p>
      <p>Rodney Reed, 51, is set to be executed Nov. 20 in the strangulation death of Stacey Stites, a white woman, April 23, 1996, in Bastrop County, Texas, according to the Innocence Project.</p>
      <p>“16 days left and he will be executed for a crime he didn’t commit .. get more info here! #freerodneyreed,” the rapper said in a tweet Monday and linked to a petition site for Reed. Other celebrities like <b>Rihanna</b>, <b>Kim Kardashian</b>, <b>T.I.</b>, and even the European Union have taken to social media to direct their concerns to Texas Governor Gregg Abbott and push the petition.</p>

      <p>The man was convicted by an all-white jury when DNA from Stites’ body matched Reed’s, but he admitted he was having an affair with the woman, according to The Guardian.</p>
      <p>Attorney Lee Merritt is promoting a rally set for Saturday to urge Gov. Abbott to stay Reed’s execution.</p>
      <p>“We will (be) joined by Rodney Reed’s family AND the family of the VICTIM, Merritt said. “We are all saying the same thing RODNEY REED IS INNOCENT.”</p>

      <p>Merritt has helped circulate <a href="https://www.freerodneyreed.com/">petitions</a> gaining more than one million signatures combined to urge the governor’s support, he said on Twitter Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Our attorneys are working nonstop to secure a stay. We need to match these efforts with a strong physical presence! #itsonus,” Merritt said in the tweet.</p>
      <p>Shaun King, an activist who has also taken up Reed’s cause, said Tuesday on Twitter that 26 Texas legislators signed an emergency <a href="https://twitter.com/shaunking/status/1191724882356293633?s=20">letter</a> to Abbott urging he grant a stay of Reed’s execution and consider commuting his sentence.</p>
      <p>“This is progress,” King said in the tweet. “PLEASE do this @GovAbbott.”</p>
      <p>The Innocence Project, which is representing Reed, said on its website that Reed’s legal team filed an application for clemency Thursday with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.</p>
      <p>Reed’s attorneys asked in their application that the board recommend to Gov. Abbott a commutation of the inmate’s death sentence in light of “mounting new evidence of his innocence,” the Innocence Project said.</p>

          <b>Rodney Reed, Convicted by All-White Texas Jury, Nears Execution Despite Dirty White Ex-Cop Allegedly Bragging About Committing the Crime</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Cited in the application is a new sworn affidavit by fellow prison mate and neo-Nazi gang member, Arthur Snow of the Aryan Brotherhood.</p>
      <p>Snow, who was in prison for forgery, stated that the victim’s fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, bragged about Stites’ murder while Fennell was serving a 10-year prison sentence for kidnapping and sexual assaulting a woman in his custody in 2007, according to the Statesman.</p>
      <p>“He was talking about his fiance with a lot of hatred and anger,” Snow said in the three-page affidavit. “Jimmy said his fiance had been sleeping around with a black man behind his back.” </p>
      <p>So Fennell killed her, Snow alleged. He is the fourth new witness defense attorneys produced to halt Reed’s execution, the Statesman reported.</p>
      <p>Other factors pointing to a miscarriage of justice include this from the <a href="https://www.innocenceproject.org/stand-with-rodney-reed-on-texas-death-row/">Innocence Project:</a> “Furthermore, three forensic experts have submitted affidavits recanting their original testimony and stating that the original time of death is inaccurate, making the timeline for Reed killing Stites implausible.</p>
