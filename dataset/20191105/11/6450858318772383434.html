      <p>Google launched a more affordable version of its flagship Pixel 3 at Google I/O on 7 May.</p>
      <p>The mid-range phones cost £399/US$399 for the 3a and £469/US$479 for the 3a XL at launch, much cheaper than the regular models which have an RRP of £739/$799 and £869/$899, respectively. See our full comparison <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/pixel-3a-vs-3a-xl-3696457/">here,</a> as well as our reviews of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/google-pixel-3a-3696430/">3a</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/pixel-3a-xl-3696476/">3a XL</a>.</p>
      <p>However, now the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/google-pixel-4-3776096/">Pixel 4</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/google-pixel-4-xl-3776327/">Pixel 4 XL</a> have arrived, there are some good discounts around. Check out our round-up <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/news/mobile-phone/google-pixel-3a-xl-deals-3696459/">here</a>. </p>
      <p>Despite the lower price, you still get the rear camera from the premium range, which is rare for mid-range phones. You also get a 5.8in screen on the 3a and 6in screen on the 3a XL, which you'll want to keep safe from damage.</p>
      <p>(Read more about the phones' technical specifications <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/new-product/mobile-phone/google-pixel-3a-3694714/">here</a>.)</p>
      <p>While we haven't tried all these cases before, we have been impressed with these brands in the past and so can recommend their products with confidence. </p>
