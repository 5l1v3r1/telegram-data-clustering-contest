      <p>Throughout November, you can find weekly deals at Tesco Mobile on Samsung, Huawei, and Apple phones.</p>
      <p>Black Friday isn't until the end of the month (ish) but that's not going to stop retailers from rolling out deals as early as possible to tempt you into parting ways with your paycheck already. Tesco Mobile is getting its foot in the door by offering a series of one-week exclusive deals all month long, but it's kicking off the festivities with the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-an-android-champ-to-get-excited-about/">Samsung S10</a> for £29.99 a month, down from £35.99, with 2GB of data, 5000 minutes and 5,000 texts. If that tickles your fancy, you have until December 1 to nab it at that price.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.tescomobile.com/black-friday">first week of deals</a> includes discounts on three handsets over the course of a 36-month contract:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/09/the-iphone-xs-is-forever/">iPhone XS Max</a></b> - £41.49 per month down from £46.49, saving a total of £180, with 2GB of data, 5000 minutes 5000 texts,</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/samsung-galaxy-a50-review-the-new-budget-smartphone-to-beat/">Samsung A50</a></b> - £17.49 per month down from £18.99, saving a total of £54, with 1GB of data, 5000 minutes, 5000 texts</li>
        <li><b>Huawei Y7</b> - £11.99 per month down from £12.99, saving a total of £36, with 500MB of data, 250 minutes, 5,000 texts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There's also a super early Christmas deal on the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/07/the-super-cheap-nokia-2-2-launches-today/">Nokia 2.2</a> which sees the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/06/nokia-2-cheapes-android-q-phone/">£100 handset</a> on offer for just £8 a month with 500MB of data, 250 minutes and 5000 texts. Tesco is even throwing in a free Juice Marshmallow Bluetooth speaker which usually retails for £15. The offer is hanging around until December 1.</p>
      <p>If you're all set for a handset, there's always the SIM only double data Black Friday bundles; for £20 a month you can get 16GB of data (instead of 8GB), 500 minutes and 5000 texts.</p>
