      <p>Security experts <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/experts-dont-reboot-your-computer-after-youve-been-infected-with-ransomware/">don't recommend that users reboot their computers after suffering a ransomware infection</a>, as this could help the malware in certain circumstances. From a report:<i> Instead, experts recommend that victims power down the computer, disconnect it from their network, and reach out to a professional IT support firm. Experts are recommending against PC reboots because a recent survey of 1,180 US adults who fell victim to ransomware in the past years has shown that almost 30% of victims chose to reboot their computers as a way to deal with the infection. But while rebooting in safe mode is a good way of removing older screenlocker types of ransomware, it is not recommended when dealing with modern ransomware versions that encrypt files. <br/><br/>"Generally, the [ransomware] executable that actually encrypts your data is designed to crawl through attached, mapped and mounted drives to a given machine. Sometimes it trips, or is blocked by a permission issue and will stop encrypting," Bill Siegel, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Coveware, a company that provides ransomware data recovery services told ZDNet in an email this week. "If you reboot the machine, it will start back up and try to finish the job," Siegel said.</i></p>
