      <p>McConaughey continued: “This is my first venture into sharing myself and my views with the world and I’m a little bit nervous about it because quite frankly.</p>
      <p>“I’m not quite sure I want to have the dialogue. But I know I have to have the dialogue, too. So I’m looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>The message continued: “I’m looking forward to sharing who I am with you, to seeing if who I am translates, if what I want to share translates…</p>
      <p>“If it tickles your funny bone, if it makes you think a second, if it makes your heart swell up a little bit, if it makes you take a quiet moment and go for a walk.”</p>
      <p>He concluded: “Let’s have some fun with it though.”</p>
      <p>McConaughey’s latest role comes in new indie film <i>The Beach Bum</i>. In <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-beach-bum-review-matthew-mcconaughey">a four-star review of the film</a>, <i>NME</i>‘s Ella Kemp says: “<i>The Beach Bum</i> is a film of vignettes, of cartoonish coincidences that link arms and stroll down promenades together. It roams, and has the best time doing so.</p>
      <p>“It’s refreshing to experience a film fuelled by its prohibited life supplies, that so rarely feels anything less than tremendous fun.”</p>
