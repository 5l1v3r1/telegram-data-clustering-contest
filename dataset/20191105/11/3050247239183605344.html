      <h1>President Erdogan: Turkey to Finish Testing Digital Lira in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:51:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:51</time> by <a rel="author">Helen Partz</a></address>
      <p>Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan directed that the government should finish testing the national central bank digital currency (CBDC) in 2020. The country’s national blockchain-based digital lira is planned to be issued by the Central Bank in accordance with the 2020 Annual Presidential Program, Cointelegraph Turkey <a href="https://tr.cointelegraph.com/news/turkey-plans-to-issue-central-bank-digital-currency-in-2020">reported</a> on Nov. 5.</p>
      <h3>Digital lira ‘instant payment’ pilots should be finalized by the end of 2020</h3>
      <p>Published on Nov. 3, the Presidential Program specifies that the first trials of the digital lira should be conducted and finalized by the end of 2020, according to a <a href="https://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2019/11/20191104M1-1.pdf">document</a> published by Turkey’s official national publication Resmi Gazete on Nov. 4.</p>
      <p>Within the pilots, the government reportedly plans to develop a software platform for instant payments based on the digital lira. Alongside the central bank, the project will also involve the national tech innovation agency — the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey, also known as TUBITAK.</p>
      <p>As reported by Cointelegraph Turkey, the launch of the digital lira is part of the country’s objective to strengthen the local economy. The document reads:</p>
      <blockquote>"The main objective is to establish a financial sector with a strong institutional structure that can respond to the financing needs of the real sector at a low cost, offer different financial instruments to a wide investor base through reliable institutions and support Istanbul's goal of becoming an attractive global financial center."</blockquote>
      <h3>Industry adoption rises in Turkey</h3>
      <p>The inclusion of the digital lira in the 2020 Annual Presidential Program of Turkey follows previous plans outlined by the state in the country’s 2019-2023 economic roadmap <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/turkey-puts-central-bank-digital-currency-on-new-economic-roadmap">issued</a> in July 2019. In addition to a CBDC, the government is interested in implementing blockchain technology for transportation and customs as well as public services and administration.</p>
      <p>In September, the government of Turkey <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/turkey-announces-plans-for-a-national-blockchain-infrastructure">announced</a> plans to set up a national blockchain infrastructure to deploy distributed ledger technology in public administration.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-to-speak-at-turkish-summit-alongside-govt-bigwigs">reported</a> Nov. 1, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, will be a speaker at the Turkish Capital Markets Summit 2019 in Istanbul from Nov. 19–20, 2019.</p>
