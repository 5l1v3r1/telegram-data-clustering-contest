      <p>Launching later this week on Nintendo Switch is <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/football_game"><b>Football Game</b></a>, but despite what the title might suggest, you won't actually be playing much football.</p>
      <p>Instead, this one is a point-and-click thriller inspired by the classics of the genre released back in the '80s and '90s. You'll be joining Tommy, a local high school football hero, as he wakes up before a big game. He had planned to meet up with his girlfriend before the match, but something isn't quite right.</p>
      <p>You'll soon find yourself exploring the environment by interacting with objects and inspecting them to solve puzzles, all in the hope of finding Tommy's sweetheart.</p>
      <blockquote><b><u>Features:</u></b><br/>- Traditional point and click adventure game aesthetic with puzzles and dialogue interactions<br/>- Meet a cast of characters including friends, foes, teachers, and a concerned mother<br/>- An award-winning OST by UK duo JUPITER-C</blockquote>

      <p>The game arrives on Switch this Friday, 8th November. You'll be able to pick it up from the eShop for $4.99 / 4.99€.</p>
