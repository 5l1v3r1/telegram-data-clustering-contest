      <p>Chrome OS just became more useful if you rely on it for getting work done. Google is rolling out a Chrome OS 78 update that more formally introduces the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/14/chrome-os-76-virtual-desktops/">virtual desktop support</a> seen in August. Anyone can create "Virtual Desks" that organize app and window layouts as separate spaces. You could have an all-business desktop for when you're trying to finish a report, and a leisure desktop when you want to watch videos and catch up with friends. You only have to open Overview and hit New Desk to create a space.</p>
      <p>There are some fresher additions as well. If you use an Android phone and have Chrome syncing enabled, you can right-click phone numbers on your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-google-pixelbook-go-review.html">Chromebook</a> to send them over and start calls. Supported printers now show up automatically, so you won't have to walk through setup just to print a copy of a travel itinerary. And if you think Google could do better, a brief press-and-hold of the power button will show a feedback option. To put it another way, this update could ensure that future upgrades are more to your liking.</p>
