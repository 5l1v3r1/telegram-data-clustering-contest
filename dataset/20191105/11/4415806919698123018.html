      <h1>Green Party throws weight behind SDLP in South Belfast</h1>
      <address>

      <p>The Green Party has become the latest in Northern Ireland to announce that it will stand aside in a constituency to back another party’s candidate in the UK General Election.</p>
      <p>The Greens’ South Belfast MLA Clare Bailey said she will not be a candidate in the December 12 poll, and instead urged her supporters to back the SDLP’s Claire Hanna.</p>
      <p>South Belfast is expected to be a close race between Ms Hanna and DUP incumbent Emma Little-Pengelly.</p>

      <p>Ms Bailey, who leads the Green Party NI, said she wants to see a pro-Remain MP in the seat.</p>
      <p>“These are extraordinary times that demand an extraordinary response,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Almost 70% of the people of South Belfast voted to remain in the EU and it is vital that a pro-Remain MP is returned.</p>
      <p>“This is a first-past-the-post election and Claire Hanna is best placed to take the South Belfast seat from the incumbent pro-Brexit MP based on previous results.”</p>

      <p>Ms Little-Pengelly won South Belfast at the 2017 general election, polling 13,299 votes, ahead of nearest rival Alasdair McDonnell of the SDLP on 11,303.</p>
      <p>However, she is likely to come under pressure if many of the 7,000 Sinn Fein votes and 2,000 Green Party votes at the 2017 poll are lent to Ms Hanna.</p>
      <p>The move is the latest in a series of announcements by parties lending support to rivals.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Sinn Féin said it would not run candidates in South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down.</p>
      <p>It will instead back pro-Remain parties, including the SDLP in South Belfast, Alliance in East Belfast, and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon in North Down.</p>
      <p>The SDLP said it will not run candidates in North Belfast, East Belfast or North Down, and asked its supporters to vote for other pro-Remain candidates.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, unionists are also preparing to stand aside to support rivals.</p>
      <p>Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster announced that her party will not run in Fermanagh South Tyrone, and will instead back former Ulster Unionist MP Tom Elliott in a bid to unseat Sinn Féin’s Michelle Gildernew.</p>
      <p>Mr Elliott has declined to say whether he intends to run.</p>
      <p>Incoming Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken appeared to make a U-turn on the issue over the weekend.</p>
      <p>He had previously indicated that his party will stand in all 18 constituencies in the region.</p>
      <p>However, on Sunday he announced that the UUP will not field a candidate in North Belfast, where DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds is expected to come under pressure from Sinn Féin candidate John Finucane.</p>
