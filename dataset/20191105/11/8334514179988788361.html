      <p>FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss banking software company Avaloq is starting preparations for a 2020 sale or initial public offering as its private equity shareholder Warburg Pincus seeks an exit, people close to the matter said.</p>
      <p>The buyout group, which owns 45% of Avaloq, is expected to mandate advisers soon to handle the divestiture, the sources said, adding that an auction could launch in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Avaloq founder Francisco Fernandez, management and employees also hold shares in the company.</p>
      <p>Avaloq and Warburg Pincus declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Avaloq Chief Executive Juerg Hunziger had said this year that the company was preparing for an IPO or sale within the next two to four years.</p>
      <p>Avaloq, founded in 1985 as BZ Informatik, supplies software for financial institutions such as Barclays, BBVA, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Rothschild, Societe Generale and Vontobel. Its software programmes manage $4.5 trillion in client money.</p>
      <p>In the first half of 2019, Avaloq posted a 5% year-on-year increase in revenues as well as core earnings, to 288 million francs in sales and adjusted EBITDA of 38 million.</p>
      <p>Larger and more profitable peer Temenos trades at 25 times its expected core earnings.</p>
