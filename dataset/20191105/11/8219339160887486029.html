      <h1>Apple TV+ praised for its high bitrate streaming video quality</h1>

      <p>Whatever you think of the material on offer, you can’t really deny that Apple TV+ shows look amazing. With most TV+ content offering 4K HDR video and Dolby Atmos sound, Apple is flexing its CDN muscles with its new streaming service.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/flatforums/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=12779">In a forum post</a>, FlatpanelsHD editor-in-chief Rasmus Larsen has now put some numbers to the claims.</p>
      <p>Rasmus Larsen writes that TV+ shows have the highest streaming quality for 4K out of all the services on the market at the moment, and eclipses most iTunes movies in bit rates.</p>
      <p>Apple TV+ drama <i>SEE</i> hit highs of 41 Mbps with an average bitrate of 29 Mbps when streaming using an <a href="https://amzn.to/36wh1JP">Apple TV 4K</a>. Even the Snoopy cartoon recorded a 13Mbps average, which is high given it is a 2D cartoon with a relatively limited color palette.</p>

      <p>This is about half the size of a Hollywood movie recorded on UHD Bluray media. Blurays have always offered the best quality and lowest compression but the stats for Apple TV+ really are impressive for a streaming service.</p>
      <p>Whilst maximum quality is mostly a benefit, we have received some complaints about the lack of a Low Data Mode. Apple’s streaming technology ramps up and down depending on available network conditions but there’s no way to force the device to use a lower quality stream at all times.</p>
      <p>In countries like India, where mobile data is vastly prevalent compared to home broadband, low data modes help to conserve data usage. As it stands today, TV+ can very quickly blow through a data cap.</p>
