        <b>RCEP deal: Japan keen on having India aboard</b>
      </p>
      <p>India’s exit from RCEP regional trade talks appeared to leave China and Japan at odds over whether to press ahead with the remaining members, or to try to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/rcep-deal-japan-keen-on-having-india-aboard-says-will-find-a-workaround-119110500452_1.html">find a workaround</a> that includes PM Modi’s government. India announced Monday it was withdrawing from the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, citing the deal’s potential impact on the livelihoods of its most vulnerable citizens. China said that the 15 remaining countries decided to move forward first and India is welcome to join RCEP whenever it’s ready. Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said Tuesday that Tokyo would work toward a deal including India. This would keep the world’s largest democracy within the RCEP framework and be in line with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policy of bolstering ties with India in order to balance Beijing’s growing power.</p>
