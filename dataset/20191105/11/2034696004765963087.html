      <p>Damon was a guest on Conan O’Brien’s late night TV show last night (November 4) and recalled the last fight he’d been a part of, and that Affleck was the one who helped him out of it.</p>
      <p>“I mouthed off to this kid that I knew, but he was like your height,” Damon said to Conan, “like six foot six, and I might have been 5’3 at the time, and I said something.</p>
      <p>“I’d scored on him or something, and I don’t know, I said something but he came for me. And it was like this mountain of a guy came at me and I was like, ‘Oh man.’ So before I knew it, it was like I was on the ground, he was above me, and I was like, ‘This is gonna be bad.'”</p>

      <p>Damon continued: “It was right then that little five foot two Ben Affleck tackled this dude off of me, like out of nowhere. I was, like, a junior and he was, like, a freshman, and he tackled this kid off of me, literally at the risk of his own life.”</p>
      <p>“I remember that was a big moment,” Damon reflected, “going like, ‘This guy, he will put himself in a really bad spot for me.’ Like, ‘This is a good friend to have.'”</p>
