      <h2>Black Friday is not here yet but a price war has already started for the Nintendo Switch</h2>

      <p>Black Friday has not arrived yet but Argos has joined a price war on the Nintendo Switch gaming console.</p>
      <p>Last week Very launched a bundle deal to get the Nintendo Switch for less than £300 with a game and now Argos has joined the battle by offering the Lite version of the device for under £200.</p>
      <p>The Nintendo Switch Lite is a stripped-down version of the system and the main difference is that it cannot be played on TV. Instead it is a portable version offering all of the same games as the standard Switch.</p>
      <p>Argos has cut the price of the Nintendo Switch Lite for just £199 via its <a href="https://fave.co/2JNXhY3">eBay store</a> but users of deals website HotUKDeals have found you can get a further 10% off using the code PRISTINE.</p>
      <p>The code brings the price of the Switch Lite down to just £179.99, which makes it one of the cheapest deals around in the run up to Black Friday.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It compares to the Currys PC World, where the <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=1599&amp;clickref=Birmingham-Switchdeal&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.currys.co.uk%252Fgbuk%252Ftv-and-home-entertainment%252Fgaming%252Fgaming-consoles%252Fnintendo-switch-lite-mario-kart-8-deluxe-bundle-turquoise-10198471-pdt.html%253Fawc%253D1599_1572952096_8ddf1efc74365b40057d103eb9b92e19%2526srcid%253D369%2526xtor%253DAL-1%2526cmpid%253Daff%7EConsole%252520Deals%7EComparison%252520Engine%7E88269%7ERazor%252BCreations%252BLtd%5D%5D">Nintendo Switch Lite is currently £219</a> - but that deal does come with Mario Kart 8. It stocks the Nintendo Switch Lite without any games for £199.99.</p>
      <p>Very is also selling the <a href="https://fave.co/2WR7Vms">Nintendo Switch Lite for £199.99</a> while Amazon has the turquoise version <a href="https://amzn.to/2WL84rB">for £197</a> for Prime members with next day shipping.</p>
      <p>For those who want the full Nintendo Switch, Very is selling a <a href="https://fave.co/34jAiMz">Nintendo Switch grey console</a> with Lego Move 2, Lego DC Super Villians and Lego Worlds for just £329.99 online, which is down from £369.99.</p>
      <p>The £40 saving makes it one of the best Nintendo Switch bundle deals on the market today and the retailer is also offering ways to save an extra £50 with a discount code that can be found on the deal page, bringing the overall price down to £280.</p>
      <p>You can get the <a href="https://fave.co/34jAiMz">deal here</a> until 7 November.</p>
