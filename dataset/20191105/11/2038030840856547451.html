      <p>Cape Town - Less than a year after tying the knot in 1982, Prince Charles and Princess Diana were expecting their first child together.</p>
      <p>Just two years after welcoming their firstborn, Prince William, the late Lady Diana was carrying another royal – only this time she kept the baby’s gender a secret from her husband, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/princess-diana-kept-secret-charles-20797617"><b>Mirror News</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>Journalist Andrew Morton revealed in his explosive autobiography <i>Diana: Her True Story – In Her Words</i>, that the Princess of Wales kept Harry’s gender a secret because her husband wanted a girl.</p>
      <p>Andrew says Lady Di knew Harry was a boy.</p>
      <p>“I knew Harry was going to be a boy because I saw on the scan. Charles always wanted a girl,” he penned were her words at the time.</p>
      <p>“He wanted two children, and he wanted a girl,” she said.</p>
      <p>Despite knowing the baby’s gender she kept it a secret from him until Harry was born in 1984.</p>
      <p>When the Duke of Sussex was born, the Prince of Wales was unimpressed with the fact that it was a boy, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7646559/Princess-Diana-kept-Prince-Harrys-gender-secret-biographer-claims.html"><b>DailyMail</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>“Oh God, it’s a boy,” were allegedly Prince Charles’ first words at the time of Harry’s birth. To which he added, “And he’s even got red hair!”</p>
      <p>Although the now 70-year-old insists he was joking, it’s alleged he also told Diana’s mother, Frances Kydd, at Harry’s christening that they were hoping for a girl, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10269290/princess-diana-harry-gender-secret-pregnant-girl/"><b>The Sun</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>“We were so disappointed – we thought it would be a girl,” Andrew noted were Prince Charles’ words to his mother-in-law.</p>
      <p>To which she allegedly responded, “You should realise how lucky you are to have a child that’s normal.”</p>
