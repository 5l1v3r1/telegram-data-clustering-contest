      <h1>Saracens issue statement in wake of massive fine and points deduction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T11:53:41+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 11:53</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Saracens have claimed <a href="https://www.saracens.com/club-statement-salary-cap/">they will appeal Tuesday’s “heavy-handed” Premiership Rugby Limited decision</a> to fine them £5,360,272.31 and deduct 35 league points.</p>
      <p>In a statement released shortly after PRL <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/saracens-salary-acing-potential-35-point-reduction-and-a-real-threat-of-relegation/">confirmed last Sunday’s <i>RugbyPass</i> story</a> that the London club would be severely sanctioned following salary cap breaches, Saracens said: “We are shocked and disappointed by these heavy-handed sanctions and will launch an appeal against all the disciplinary panel’s findings.</p>
      <p>“The club is pleased the panel acknowledged it did not deliberately attempt to breach the salary cap and steadfastly maintains that player co-investments do not constitute salary under the regulations. This view is supported by independent legal and professional experts.</p>
      <p>“The club will continue to vigorously defend this position especially as PRL precedent already exists whereby co-investments have not been deemed part of salary in the regulations.</p>
      <p>“As previously stated, the club made administrative errors relating to the non-disclosure of some transactions to PRL and for this, we apologise. We are pleased to confirm we now have a robust governance framework in place and this will be overseen by an external counsel to ensure the club follows best practice.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Furthermore, it is the club’s belief that the panel’s narrow interpretation of the regulations is detrimental to player welfare across the league and is damaging the development of elite-level rugby in the UK.</p>
      <p>“Saracens is proud of its pioneering, innovative approach to player welfare, developing their talents and supporting their entrepreneurial spirit for life beyond rugby.”</p>

      <p>Saracens’ feisty response came after the PRL’s penalty initially left them on -26 points in the relegation spot on the early <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> table, 30 points adrift of 11th place Bath. Having announced they will appeal, they were restored to fourth spot on the table with nine points subject to review.</p>
