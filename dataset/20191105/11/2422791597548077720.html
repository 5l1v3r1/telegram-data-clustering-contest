      <p>A Louisiana man was arrested after stealing an electric powered shopping cart from Walmart to avoid getting a DWI, police said.</p>
      <p>Brice Kendell Williams, 32, was charged with felony unauthorized use of a moveable<b> </b>after driving the motorized shopping cart over half a mile away from one bar to another, according to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1379937678905532/photos/a.1382270915338875/2510688362497119/?type=3&amp;theater">Terrebonne Parish Sheriff's Office</a>. His bond was set at $2,500, police said in a statement.</p>
      <p>A deputy with the sheriff's office responded to a bar in Houma, Louisiana, around 12:30 a.m. Sunday after receiving a complaint about someone arriving to a bar in a shopping cart, according to the statement. The town is about 60 miles southwest of New Orleans.</p>
      <p>When the deputy arrived, he found the shopping cart parked between two cars in the bar's parking lot.</p>
      <p>Williams told the responding deputy that he was at a different bar and thought that if he drove his car, he could get charged with a DWI, the sheriff's office said. Instead, Williams opted to steal the electric shopping cart, which is meant for disabled people, and drive it to a different bar, the sheriff's office said.</p>
      <p>CNN has not determined whether Williams has legal representation at this time.</p>
