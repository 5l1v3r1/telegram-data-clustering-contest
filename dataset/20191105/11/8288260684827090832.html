      <p>The world's first and oldest Post Office is on the brink of closure - after more than 300 YEARS.</p>
      <p>Sanquhar Post Office in Sanquhar, Dumfries and Galloway opened its doors in 1712, and is recognised by the Guinness World Records as the first post office in the world.</p>
      <p>It has become an unlikely tourist attraction for stamp collectors, as well as being a ‘lifeline’ for elderly people in the community who depend on it for banking.</p>
      <p>But the accolade could be lost if the 307-year-old institution closes, as its owners plan to retire, and the title could be conceded to a branch in Stockholm, Sweden, which opened in 1720.</p>

      <p>The Post Office bounced back from the brink of closure in 2015, when it was taken over by Dr Manzoor Alam, 77, and his wife Nazra, 67.</p>
      <p>But the couple are now planning to retire, and are hopeful a new owner could be found to keep it open when they step down at the end of May 2019.</p>
      <p>Nazra said: “It’s breaking my heart but I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do.</p>

      <p>“If my health was better I’d carry on but I’ve got to call it a day now - it’s really sad.</p>
      <p>“It served the community well.</p>
      <p>“It’s up for sale and I’ve put in my notice with the Post Office.</p>
      <p>“At the end of May should be my last working day.</p>
      <p>“What happens between now and then we’ll just take it as it comes.</p>

      <p>“It’d be nice if we could find a buyer.</p>
      <p>“We’re doing it because my husband’s and my health isn’t great.</p>
      <p>“Next year it’ll be five years since we’ve had it.</p>
      <p>“I’d hate to think it’ll shut down and become a supermarket or something.</p>
      <p>“The last four years was remarkable, every bit of it.”</p>

      <p>The branch is on the market for £275,000, and comes with a three bedroom cottage.</p>
      <p>The Post Office is popular with its banking service as Sanquhar, which is home to around just 2,000 people, only has one bank - after the closure of the town’s RBS in 2014.</p>
      <p>The branch is also an attraction for tourists, post enthusiasts and stamp collectors, who seek to have their letters hand stamped at the world’s oldest Post Office.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Nazra formerly worked as a nurse before taking over the branch with two part-time assistants.</p>

      <p>But she now wants to live closer to her family in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Nazra said: “We’ve got a lot of banking taking place in the Post Office.</p>
      <p>“We’ve only got one other bank, the Bank of Scotland.</p>
      <p>“We get a lot of tourists during the summer as well.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Chairman of Sanquhar and District Community Council, Duncan Close, said: “We were been in this situation five years ago.</p>
      <p>“It changed hands and was reasonably secure for a bit.</p>
      <p>“We called a public meeting to discuss the matter and see what we can do.</p>
      <p>“We will do everything we can to ensure the place does find a buyer.</p>
      <p>“We’re sorry to see them go but it’s sad at the same time to think we could lose our Post Office.”</p>

      <p>Andrew Wood, SNP councillor for Dumfries and Galloway, said: “It’ll be a sad day if it does close.</p>
      <p>“What we’re finding in a lot of rural places like Sanquhar is they’re struggling to keep their post offices open.</p>
      <p>“They’re a lifeline for the elderly.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just about collecting their pensions, it’s about meeting other people.</p>

      <p>“I was wondering if the community could arrange a buy out but it shouldn’t come down to that.</p>
      <p>“We’re a wealthy country and should be able to have them in good sized towns.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know why they've went down the road of being in shops - we’ve got to stop this centralisation.”</p>
