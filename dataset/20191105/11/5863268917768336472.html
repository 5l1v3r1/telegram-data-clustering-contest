      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – In another step closer to digitalising the real estate sector of Pakistan and facilitating the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) in tax collections, the government has approved conducting a digital survey on sale and purchase of the properties in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Sources familiar with the matter told the media on Tuesday that the survey which aims to collect maximum possible accurate data of the properties would be completed within two years.</p>
      <p>A Chinese-style ‘Digitised Land Survey’ has been suggested and upon completion of the survey, all information of properties will be computerised.</p>
      <p>The exact calculation of the sale and purchase of the properties will be in accordance with current rates.</p>
      <p>Importantly, the move will significantly help the FBR in property tax collection.</p>
