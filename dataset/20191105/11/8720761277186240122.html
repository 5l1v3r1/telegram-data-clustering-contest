      <p>The German government and car industry have <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-government-expands-subsidies-for-electric-cars/a-51113225">agreed to increase joint subsidies for the purchase of electric cars</a> on the same day automobile giant Volkswagen began production of a new all-electric vehicle. From a report:<i> The agreement between the government and the automobile industry was reached following a Monday evening "car summit" aimed at fostering the mass production of cleaner transportation. Under the agreement, consumer subsidies for electric cars costing less than $44,500 will increase to about $6,700 from from $4,400. Purchasers of plug-in hybrids in this price range would be given a subsidy of $5,000, up from $3,320. For electric cars over $44,500, there will be an increase in the subsidy by 25%. Industry and government will evenly split the cost of the subsidies. The subsidies will also be extended from the end of 2020 to the end of 2025. In addition to the subsidy issue, the two sides discussed ways to expand infrastructure for electric cars.</i></p>
