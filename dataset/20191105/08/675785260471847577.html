      <h2>Lewis Hamilton became Formula 1 World Champion for the sixth time on Sunday - but Mercedes' season was struck by tragedy following the death of an employee</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> achieved his sixth Formula 1 World Championship in the wake of a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mercedes-f1">Mercedes</a> employee’s tragic death.</p>
      <p>Hamilton’s second-place finish at the US Grand Prix on Sunday was enough to secure the title but his team have been left devastated by the fatality last month.</p>
      <p>A 29-year-old employee was on his way home from the team’s Brackley HQ in Northamptonshire in the early hours of October 15 when tragedy struck.</p>
      <p>The unnamed employee was travelling in a Mercedes 300 AMG which came off the A422, mounted a grass verge and crashed into a tree.</p>
      <p>He was confirmed dead at the scene.</p>

      <p>Northamptonshire Police are currently preparing a file for the coroner.</p>
      <p>The force have called for anyone with information to get in contact.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: “Just after midnight on Tuesday, October 15, a White Mercedes 300 AMG travelling in the direction of Farthinghoe left the carriageway, for reasons yet unknown, mounted the grass verge and collided with a tree.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the collision, the driver, a 29-year-old man, died at the scene.”</p>

      <p>A Mercedes spokesperson said: “We can sadly confirm that a team member lost his life in a road traffic accident when returning home on the evening of Monday 14 October.</p>
      <p>“The team is in contact with the family and supporting them at this difficult time.”</p>
      <p>The fatal incident happened less than 48 hours after Mercedes won the Constructors’ Championship.</p>
      <p>Valtteri Bottas’ victory in the Japanese Grand Prix combined with Hamilton’s podium finish was enough to clinch team success.</p>

      <p>Hamilton’s latest title puts him second on the all-time list behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/michael-schumacher-ski-accident-10360005">Michael Schumacher</a> .</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old dedicated his win to his family and the late Niki Lauda.</p>
      <p>Hamilton's family including father Anthony, the driving force behind Lewis' career, step-mother, Linda and paternal mother Carmen were there to watch his coronation in Austin.</p>
      <p>Hamilton said: "It's hard to understand what I'm feeling right now. Naturally, it's just pure happiness and I feel more humble than ever.</p>

      <p>"I just saw my parents as I came in and just looking at my dad's smile says it all.</p>
      <p>"He supported me from day one - as did Linda, as did my mum. They've worked so hard for me to be here so I really wanted them to come out together.</p>
      <p>"I think this the first race I can remember for a long, long time that they've been together and us being united as a family.</p>
      <p>"Cloud nine doesn't even get close to where I am. I'm somewhere far above that."</p>
