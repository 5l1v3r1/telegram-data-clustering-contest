      <h1>Liam Payne says his mum was furious about 'soft porn' shoot with Stella Maxwell</h1>
      <h2>The former One Direction star transformed into a hunky model for a raunchy shoot with the Victoria's Secret Angel</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:48:01+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Wallis</a></address>
      <p>Former One Direction star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liam-payne">Liam Payne</a> left little to the imagination as he stripped off for his latest campaign with fashion giant Hugo Boss.</p>
      <p>The singer, 26, bared all for the raunchy photoshoot as he rolled around in bed with Victoria's Secret model Stella Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The hunky pop sensation has since admitted that he didn't expect the shoot to be so explicit and likened the ad to shooting "soft core porn".</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/gq-hype/article/liam-payne-interview-2019">GQ Hype</a> , Liam spoke about getting naked and admitted things got "very raunch very quickly".</p>
      <p>He said: "There was a real hollow moment afterwards where I was sitting outside smoking a cigarette thinking, 'I have basically just shot soft-core porn'."</p>
      <p>The star also revealed his mum wasn't going to be impressed.</p>

      <p>He continued: "For one, my mum is going to kill me. For another thing, I don’t know how far this is going to go... That was just the first shot!</p>
      <p>"There’s this really raunchy shot of me and Stella, and I showed my mum. She took one look at it and gave me a clip round the ear.</p>
      <p>"All I was thinking was, 'I better not tell her about the London buses!'"</p>
      <p>Liam also confessed it took him more than 10 months of gruelling training in total to prepare for the campaign.</p>

      <p>In one nude black and white snap, the butt-naked star gazes seductively at the camera while propping up his head on one bulgingly muscled arm.</p>
      <p>With his gym-honed thighs falling apart, Stella - wearing nothing but a pair of tight white Hugo boxers - straddles the length of his torso with her topless body.</p>
      <p>Liam recently admitted the modelling shoot got slightly out of hand as he and Stella downed tequila shots before getting down to their saucy antics.</p>
