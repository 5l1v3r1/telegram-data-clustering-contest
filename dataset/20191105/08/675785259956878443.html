      <h1>Ed Woodward skipped Man Utd's defeat to Bournemouth for Rugby World Cup final</h1>
      <h2>The United executive vice-chairman is a huge rugby fan, and was determined to catch England's game against South Africa</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:35:07+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>If you were expecting the closing stages of Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> on Saturday to feature shots of Ed Woodward's pained expressions, then there's a good reason why you were left disappointed.</p>
      <p>The United executive vice-chairman was some 6,000 miles away.</p>
      <p>A goal from former Red Devils youngster Josh King was enough for the Cherries to inflict what is already a fourth Premier League defeat of the season on United, who are now down in 10th place in the table.</p>
      <p>Shots of Woodward in the stands have become commonplace during United matches of late, especially when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have suffered another damaging result.</p>

      <p>Back in September the cameras appeared to catch <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/what-really-happened-between-ed-20147656">Woodward issuing a telling off to United defender Phil Jones</a> when he seemed to have mouthed something less than complementary about Solskjaer towards the end of a 2-0 defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , although this was later denied.</p>
      <p>He was nowhere to be seen on Saturday though, as he was instead taking in another disappointing defeat in Yokohama.</p>

      <p>As per the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-7645297/SPORTS-AGENDA-Jurgen-Klopps-fixtures-strop-shock-UEFA.html?ito=amp_twitter_share-top">Mail Online</a> , Woodward and United managing director Richard Arnold had jetted off to Yokohama to watch England's Rugby World Cup final clash against South Africa.</p>
      <p>The pair are both huge rugby fans, but they were left disappointed as Eddie Jones' men went down 32-12 to the Springboks, who deservedly became world champions for the third time.</p>

      <p>Woodward might have felt as though he was leaving United in good hands after a run of three successive victories in three different competitions, with Partizan Belgrade, Norwich and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> all beaten on the road in the run-up to the south coast visit.</p>
      <p>United are back at Old Trafford this week when they host Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday.</p>
