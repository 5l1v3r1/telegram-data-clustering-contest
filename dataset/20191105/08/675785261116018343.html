      <p>A boyfriend has been cleared of attacking his girlfriend after telling a jury that she was injured during "rough sex."</p>
      <p>Kane Elliott, 26, was accused of assaulting his naked partner before stamping on her and slashing her back with knives.</p>
      <p>But Elliott told a court it happened during "a really weird sex game" after the pair had been drinking heavily.</p>
      <p>He denied wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, unlawful wounding and making a threat to kill and was found not guilty by a jury.</p>
      <p>Cardiff Crown Court heard his partner wanted to "try something new" and asked him to "strangle her then slapped him across the face".</p>

      <p>Giving evidence at the trial, he said: “We were drinking heavily then the sex games began. She was very much into very rough sex.</p>
      <p>“She said she wanted to try some new sex stuff. It got really weird. I did not know what to think.”</p>
      <p>“From there it just got violent. Her idea was to involve the violence with the sex. She insisted on strangulation. She just wanted more and more and more.</p>
      <p>“She slapped me across the face. I was not expecting her to hit me. I realised I was not enjoying it. I pushed her off and told her to stop.”</p>
      <p>The court heard Elliott stopped and pushed her away, causing her to "go mad and start smashing up the flat".</p>
      <p>Elliott said his girlfriend destroyed a wooden table - and used a table leg to beat herself up before swinging it at him.</p>
      <p>He added: "I was knocked unconscious and came round to see blood and her playing with a knife. The next thing I remember was the police arriving."</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Meirion Davies, said: "When police arrived they found his partner naked and showing signs of heavy bleeding and injuries to her face which was swollen. She had two black eyes.</p>
      <p>"There were a number of slash marks on her back. There was bruising on her legs and arms. This was a savage battering.</p>
      <p>Mr Davies said that when police entered the flat Elliot became "very aggressive" and "began frothing at the mouth".</p>
      <p>Mr Davies said: "He kept shouting "who is she, get her out of my flat" and "she's been in here beating herself up".</p>
      <p>"He was arrested and during his police interview denied assaulting Miss Davies.</p>
      <p>"He told them she had assaulted herself as part of having rough sex."</p>
      <p>His partner told police Elliott asked her to cut herself with a knife but when she refused he cut her.</p>
      <p>Mr Davies added: "She also references being slashed in the back. She described Elliott strangling her while she was on the floor.</p>
      <p>"She was begging him to stop. She tried to escape but was dragged back.</p>
      <p>"She tried to deceive him, telling him she was pregnant. But he punched her to the stomach anyway.</p>
      <p>"At one point when she was being strangled she felt like her eyes would pop out." <br/>The court heard his partner eventually escaped and ran outside to call for help</p>
      <p>Elliott, from Cwmbran, was found not guilty of all the charges against him after a week-long trial.</p>
