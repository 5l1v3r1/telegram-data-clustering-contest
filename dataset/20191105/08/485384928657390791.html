      <p><a href="http://theconversation.com/">The Conversation</a> By Mike Berry and Ian Lowe</p>
      <p>Australia was already <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44609144?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">one of the most urbanised nations</a> by the end of the 19th century.</p>
      <p>Unlike European and North American countries, Australia's pattern of settlement did not have a neat urban hierarchy. The gap between the large and small towns was huge.</p>
      <p>These patterns have intensified in the decades since federation, especially after the World War II.</p>
      <p>International and internal <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3218.0">migration trends have driven rapid growth</a> in the big cities, especially Melbourne and Sydney. This has created major problems with providing adequate <a href="https://theconversation.com/housing-policy-reset-is-overdue-and-not-only-in-australia-112835">housing</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/congestion-busting-infrastructure-plays-catch-up-on-long-neglected-needs-114598">infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/some-suburbs-are-being-short-changed-on-services-and-liveability-which-ones-and-whats-the-solution-83966">services</a>.</p>
      <p>The fundamental issue is the reluctance of urban communities and their leaders to discuss what might be sustainable populations.</p>
      <h3>The folly of unlimited growth</h3>
      <p>No Australian city has a long-term vision showing how a future stabilised population might be supported with the essential resources of food, water and energy. No Australian city has faced up to the inevitable social tensions of <a href="https://theconversation.com/what-did-the-rich-man-say-to-the-poor-man-why-spatial-inequality-in-australia-is-no-joke-73841">increasing inequality</a> between a well-served inner-urban elite and an increasingly under-resourced urban fringe.</p>
      <p>Leaders in cities that have not grown as rapidly, such as Adelaide, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/as-the-east-coast-struggles-with-population-numbers-south-australia-is-desperate-for-a-boost/news-story/5ebca065ebe3f975ed83827d2373db37">lament their failure to grow like Sydney and Melbourne</a>, despite all the associated problems. All implicitly believe unlimited growth is possible.</p>
      <p>In reality, the expanding ecological footprints of the large cities have created unsustainable demands on land to support urban dwellers.</p>
      <p>And the wastes the cities produce are straining the capacity of the environment to handle these.</p>
      <p>Given the many unpriced flow-on effects from dense urban growth and market-led development, governments are struggling to deal with the undesirable consequences.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theconversation.com/australian-city-workers-average-commute-has-blown-out-to-66-minutes-a-day-how-does-yours-compare-120598">Congestion</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/walking-mightnt-be-good-for-you-if-its-through-australias-polluted-city-streets-88772">pollution</a> threaten to overwhelm the many social and economic benefits of urban life.</p>
      <p>The growth and concentration of populations are also driving chronic excess demand for appropriate housing. The result is <a href="https://theconversation.com/affordable-housing-lessons-from-sydney-hong-kong-and-singapore-3-keys-to-getting-the-policy-mix-right-123443">serious affordability problems</a>, which are adding to inequality across society and generations.</p>
      <p>In 1970, urban historian <a href="https://theaimn.com/book-review-ideas-for-australian-cities-by-hugh-stretton/">Hugh Stretton pointed</a> to the role of Australia's widespread owner occupation in offsetting the inequalities generated in labour markets and by inherited wealth. This is no longer the case.</p>
      <p>The dominant neoliberal economic ideology has resulted in a <a href="https://theconversation.com/australia-needs-to-reboot-affordable-housing-funding-not-scrap-it-72861">retreat from providing public housing</a>.</p>
      <p>Abandoning would-be home owners to the market has produced a situation in which urban land and house ownership is <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-the-housing-boom-is-remaking-australias-social-class-structure-66976">reinforcing class-based inequalities</a>.</p>

      <p>Home ownership is increasingly the preserve of the affluent and their children.</p>
      <p>Housing-related inequality is also seen in the geography of our cities.</p>
      <p><a href="https://theconversation.com/city-by-city-analysis-shows-our-capitals-arent-liveable-for-many-residents-85676">Poorer households are priced out of locations with better access</a> to good jobs, schools, transport, health care and other services.</p>
      <h3>Failures of governance</h3>
      <p>Governments in Australia's federation are poorly placed to respond adequately. <a href="https://theconversation.com/metropolitan-governance-is-the-missing-link-in-australias-reform-agenda-55872">Responsibilities and fiscal resources are divided</a>, creating obstacles to effective planning and infrastructure provision.</p>
      <p>The main factor driving urban population growth is an unprecedented <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1617/Quick_Guides/MigrationStatistics">rate of inward migration</a>.</p>
      <p>The national government <a href="https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/what-we-do/migration-program-planning-levels">sets large migration targets</a> as an easy way of creating economic growth. This leaves state governments with the impossible task of meeting the resulting demand for infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Jane O'Sullivan <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/135517/subdr156-infrastructure.pdf">has shown</a> each extra urban citizen requires about $250,000 of investment. The total sum is well beyond the capacity of state and local governments.</p>
      <p>Arguments between federal and state governments are heavily politicised, especially when it comes to major transport investments.</p>
      <p>Even within single jurisdictions, complex demands and unexpected consequences prevent effective action. The <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-recycling-crisis-may-be-here-to-stay-112055">waste recycling crisis</a> is a prime example.</p>
      <p>State governments must also deal with difficult trade-offs between, for example, allowing further <a href="https://theconversation.com/living-liveable-this-is-what-residents-have-to-say-about-life-on-the-urban-fringe-111339">development on the edges of cities</a> or <a href="https://theconversation.com/becoming-more-urban-attitudes-to-medium-density-living-are-changing-in-sydney-and-melbourne-84693">encouraging higher density in built-up areas</a>.</p>
      <p>This often involves <a href="https://theconversation.com/vested-interests-behind-city-shapers-often-subvert-higher-density-policies-74244">conflicts</a> with local governments and communities, concerned to protect their ways of life.</p>

      <p>Australian planners and governments have long tinkered with <a href="https://theconversation.com/making-small-cities-bigger-will-help-better-distribute-australias-25-million-people-101180">policies to encourage decentralisation to smaller cities</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite these attempts, the dominant pattern of urbanisation with its seemingly intractable problems has hardened, a triumph of reality over rhetoric.</p>
      <h3>What needs to change?</h3>
      <p>To get beyond the rhetoric and make our cities more sustainably liveable requires a much more deliberate and interventionist role for government.</p>
      <p>It also requires residents of our cities and suburbs to be willing to allow their governments to interrupt business as usual.</p>
      <p>This, we know from experience, is a big ask. It will step on the toes of the <a href="https://theconversation.com/housing-policy-is-captive-to-property-politics-so-dont-expect-politicians-to-tackle-affordability-55384">property lobby</a> and ordinary home owners.</p>
      <p>In some cases, for example, the short-term financial interests of property owners are leading local authorities to ignore scientific warnings about the impacts of climate change on coastal development.</p>
      <p>Major changes are also needed in how urban land is taxed and the proceeds invested.</p>
      <p>"Simple" reforms like <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-way-australia-taxes-housing-is-manifestly-unfair-58421">replacing stamp duty on land transfer with a universal land tax</a>, as the <a href="http://www.taxreview.treasury.gov.au/content/Content.aspx?doc=html/home.htm">Henry Tax Review</a> recommended, will take political courage that has been absent to date.</p>
      <p>More complex policies like finding ways of diverting population growth to non-metropolitan regions will take careful thought and experimentation.</p>
      <p>This might include relocating government agencies to provincial cities. This has been tried sporadically in the past at the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-04-19/decentralisation-push-for-federal-government-departments/8453816">federal</a> level and in states such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/04/victorian-public-service-jobs-to-move-to-ballarat-and-latrobe-valley">Victoria</a> and <a href="https://psa.asn.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/NSW-Decentralisation-Taskforce-Report-April-2013-FINAL.pdf">New South Wales</a>.</p>
      <p>However, such cases tend to be one-offs and do not reflect an overall strategic plan.</p>
      <p>Future generations will inevitably be critical of the complete failure of current leaders to plan for sustainable development.</p>
