      <p>SINGAPORE: Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), Singapore's second-biggest listed bank, said on Tuesday (Nov 5) its quarterly profit fell 6 per cent, hurt by a one-off charge for its Indonesian unit that overshadowed growth for its wealth management and lending businesses.</p>
      <p>In particular, higher wealth management fees helped offset a challenging environment as <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singapore-economy-grows-0-1-in-q3-avoids-technical-recession-11997366">Singapore narrowly dodged a recession</a> in the third quarter due to the trade war between the United States and China - two of its biggest export markets.</p>

      <p>"Our performance for this quarter underscored the competitive strength of our diversified business franchise," CEO Samuel Tsien said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Global and regional economic growth continued to slow, and geo-political event risks have increased. We shall remain vigilant and will maintain prudent risk management practices while exercising disciplined cost management."</p>
      <p>Net profit came in at S$1.17 billion for the July to September quarter, the lowest level in three quarters but in line with a S$1.19 billion average estimate of five analysts, according to data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Excluding the one-off charge at its Indonesian unit which was related to changes in expected credit loss modelling, OCBC's core net profit was S$1.26 billion, slightly higher than the S$1.25 billion booked a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Net wealth management fees rose 11 per cent year on year, while OCBC's net interest income grew 6 per cent to S$1.6 billion and net interest margin rose 5 basis points to 1.77 per cent.</p>
      <p>After clocking robust growth rates in recent years, Singapore's banks face a challenging outlook as interest rates soften and loan growth moderates. Its <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singdollar-mas-reduces-appreciation-currency-monetary-policy-11996054">central bank eased monetary policy</a> for the first time in three years last month.</p>

      <p>The sector is also facing its biggest shake-up in two decades after the central bank in August kicked off the application process for new digital banking licenses. Ride-hailing firm Grab and Singapore Telecommunications have expressed interest in applying for the licences, sources have said.</p>
      <p>OCBC shares were down 0.7 per cent in Tuesday morning trade, underperforming a broader market that was up 0.2 per cent.</p>
