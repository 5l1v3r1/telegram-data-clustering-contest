      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 5): A Sessions Court judge who had presided as a coroner in a highly charged inquest into the death of a political aide 10 years ago, will face a graft charge, along with a deputy public prosecutor (DPP) and a lawyer.</p>
      <p>The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) said in a statement today that it has obtained permission from the attorney-general to charge the three tomorrow at the Sessions Court in Shah Alam.</p>
