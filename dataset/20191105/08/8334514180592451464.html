      <p>Only 29% percent of Canadians view China favorably and more than half worry about possible Chinese cyber attacks, according to a poll released on Monday at a time when the two nations remain locked in a diplomatic dispute.</p>
      <p>The University of British Columbia survey also found half of Canadians did not want Huawei Technologies Co Ltd to play a major role supplying next-generation 5G network equipment.</p>
      <p>Relations between Beijing and Ottawa have been frozen since Canadian police detained Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou last December on a U.S. arrest warrant.</p>
      <p>“The chill is real,” concluded the survey. China is now viewed favorably by 29% of Canadians, down from 36% two years ago but up from 22% in February, it concluded.</p>
      <p>That said, respondents wanted commercial exchanges with China to continue, with 62% supporting the negotiation of a bilateral free trade agreement.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Meng’s arrest China blocked imports of Canadian meat products and canola seed. It also arrested two Canadians on state secrets charges.</p>
      <p>“Worries about China’s domestic impact in Canada are increasing, especially about cyber-attacks and espionage,” the survey said.</p>
      <p>The Chinese embassy in Ottawa did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The online survey of 1,503 Canadian adults - the fourth the university has done over the past two years into attitudes towards China - was carried out between Sept. 26 and Oct. 3, 2019 and is considered to have a margin of error of 3%.</p>
