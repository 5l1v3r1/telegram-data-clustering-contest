      <h1>Watch Wilco Play “Love Is Everywhere (Beware)” On <i>Seth Meyers</i></h1>

      <p>There’s something almost anti-glamorous about the way Wilco handle late-night TV performances. Other artists treat televised performances as make-or-break events, and they do everything they can to make an impression. Wilco roll up, rumpled and bedraggled, play some pretty music, and bounce This isn’t new for them.</p>
      <p>Last month, Wilco released their newest album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2059238/wilco-ode-to-joy-review/franchises/album-of-the-week/">Ode To Joy</a></i>. And last night, they were the musical guests on <i>Late Night With Seth Meyers</i>. On <i>Seth Meyers</i>, Wilco played the stately single “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2051192/wilco-love-is-everywhere-beware-ode-to-joy/music/">Love Is Everywhere (Beware)</a>.” They sounded lovely. And they looked the same as they did when they were <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2059891/watch-wilco-play-everyone-hides-on-colbert/video/">on <i>Colbert</i></a> last month. Jeff Tweedy may even have been wearing the exact same thing. Watch it below.</p>

      <p>Wilco were not the only veteran ’90s-vintage band on <i>Seth Meyers</i> last night. The Roots’ ?uestlove and Black Thought were also guests, coming upstairs from their regular home at the <i>Tonight Show</i> studio. They were there to promote <i>Hip Hop: The Songs That Shook America</i>, their new documentary-series TV show that adapts my friend Shea Serrano’s <i>The Rap Year Book</i>, and they talked about coming together as a band, traveling in tour buses that they’ve named Gryffindor and Slytherin, and all the times that Black Thought gets mistaken for Rick Ross. Here’s that interview:</p>

      <p><i>Ode To Joy</i> is out now on Wilco’s dBpm label. <i>Hip Hop: The Songs That Shook America</i> airs Sunday nights on AMC. Let’s all have fun imagining the conversation that Jeff Tweedy and ?uestlove had about producing comeback albums for aging soul/gospel legends in the green room.</p>
