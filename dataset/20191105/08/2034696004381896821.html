      <p>One half of duo <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/krept-Konan">Krept &amp; Konan,</a> Krept was assaulted back stage at BBC’s 1Xtra Live event at Birmingham Arena last month (October 5). The event, which featured a line up including  <a href="http://nme.com/artists/aj-tracey">AJ Tracey,</a> <a href="http://nme.com/artists/french-montana">French Montana</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/aitch">Aitch</a>, <a href="http://nme.com/artists/ms-banks">Ms. Banks</a>, Wizkid, DaniLeigh and <a href="http://nme.com/artists/headie-one">Headie One</a> was cancelled mid-way following the incident.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50287192">BBC</a>, Krept revealed he was left with slash wounds to his leg and neck following the assault. According to a hospital report, one wound was “1mm away” from being fatal.</p>
      <p>He said: “I got a report back saying if [the knife] was a millimetre deeper, it could have been fatal.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m just grateful to even be here. It could have been a lot worse. Thank God.”</p>

      <p>Last month, Krept &amp; Konan announced <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/krept-konan-postpone-revenge-sweet-tour-backstage-assault-2561082">that they were postponing their forthcoming UK tour after the incident.</a></p>
      <p>The rapper confirmed that their November will now take place in January 2020, after he sought advice from his doctor.</p>
      <p>He said: “My doctor has told me if I tour next month, I could risk more complications. I need to make a full recovery because you know on tour it gets wild and what we have planned requires 100% strength. My health is priority, so I know you’ll understand. 7 shows back to back in November is not physically possible for me. I don’t wanna collapse on stage lol.”</p>
      <p>The duo will still perform their biggest show to date at London’s O2 Arena on December 5.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/krept-and-konan-revenge-is-sweet-review#2jy0WzPWjBd0cgEh.99">In a four star review of Krept &amp; Konan’s latest album, NME wrote</a>: “These two rap entrepreneurs have proven that it was worth the wait for another studio album.</p>
      <p>“The years between ‘Revenge Is Sweet’ and their debut ‘Long Way Home’ have been fruitful for the duo, but – for all their dabbling – this is a welcome return to their roots.”</p>
