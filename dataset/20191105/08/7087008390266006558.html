      <h1>HODL Wins: The Majority Would Prefer Holding Bitcoin Than Gold</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:35:15+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Lyanchev</a></address>
      <p>When it comes down to investing, Bitcoin and gold have been heavily compared. According to a new poll initiated by the former Congressman of Texas, however, Bitcoin is seriously preferred over Gold and other investment options.</p>
      <h3>10-year Investment Survey</h3>
      <p>Ron Paul, the former congressman from Texas, initiated a <a href="https://twitter.com/RonPaul/status/1191384535755317249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">poll</a> on Twitter asking people what they would invest in if a wealthy person gifted them $10,000. The voters can choose between 4 options – 10-year US Treasury Bond, Federal Reserve Notes, Gold, and the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization – Bitcoin.</p>

      <p>At the time of this writing, Federal Reserve Notes have received the lowest number of votes with just 2%, and the 10-year US Treasury Bond follows with 7%. The battle for the top comes between gold and Bitcoin. While the former represents 33% of all votes, the latter is far ahead with 58%. Even though the poll is still not over, there are more than 64,000 people who have voted already.</p>
      <p>Since the poll asked about 10-year investments, the results are showing that people would rather choose Bitcoin as a long-term holding option.</p>
      <h3>Why Bitcoin Over Gold?</h3>
      <p>Over the last several years, these two assets have been compared numerous times. Many people have said that they have similarities, mainly being a store of value. Bitcoin was even officially <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-new-gold-cftc-defines-bitcoin-as-a-commodity/">defined as a commodity</a> recently – the same category as gold.</p>
      <p>Another comparison can be made in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-scarcity-can-it-eventually-catch-up-with-gold-and-silver/">the scarcity</a> of both assets. Only a finite supply of gold exists in the world and the same is true for Bitcoin. Yet, there are some notable differences as well.</p>
      <p>While we don’t know how much gold there is, Bitcoin’s protocol stipulates that only 21 million will ever be in circulation, making it the first-ever scarce digital object. Additionally, the online currency can also be easily transferred online, while gold, being a physical asset, could present <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/11/04/bitcoin-is-better-than-gold-for-one-simple-reason/amp/?__twitter_impression=true">transportation and protection issues</a> due to its weight in larger quantities.</p>
      <p>The total supply could be viewed from a different perspective, as well. Bitcoin is preprogrammed to cut in half the rewards given to miners every four years in a process called <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-bitcoin-halving-will-it-trigger-the-next-bull-run/">Halving</a>. Basically, every time this event takes place, the speed of creating new bitcoins will decrease with 50%, meaning that in just 12 years, that speed will be 90% less than what it is now. Simple economic principles dictate that when the supply of a certain asset decreases while the demand for it remains the same or increases, its price should go up. Two halvings have occurred so far, both pushing <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-chart-analysis/">Bitcoin’s price</a> to go up, and the next one <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/recent-hash-rate-acceleration-suggests-bitcoin-halving-could-take-place-in-april-2020/">will happen</a> in 2020.</p>
