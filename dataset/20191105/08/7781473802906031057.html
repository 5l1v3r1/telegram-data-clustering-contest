The diesel engine has been detuned slightly to offer 115PS, the torque output is 300Nm.

      <p>The XUV300 has been a reasonable seller in its segment, which <a href="http://overdrive.in/reviews/hyundai-venue-vs-mahindra-xuv300-vs-tata-nexon-vs-maruti-suzuki-vitara-brezza-vs-ford-ecosport/">includes cars like the Hyundai Venue, Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza, Tata Nexon and Ford Ecospor</a>t.
