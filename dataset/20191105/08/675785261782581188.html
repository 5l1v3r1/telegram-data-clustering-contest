      <h1>Facebook unveils new logo in desperate attempt to rebrand - but users are unimpressed</h1>
      <h2>Facebook has changed its name to FACEBOOK, and has replaced the distinctive blue logo with a multicolour alternative</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:44:32+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>In a desperate attempt to rebrand itself, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> has unveiled a new logo and changed its name to ‘FACEBOOK’.</p>
      <p>While the site claims that the change is ‘a way to better communicate our ownership structure’, it’s been widely mocked by confused users.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> ’s Chief Marketing Officer, Antonio Lucio, announced the change in a blog.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “We’re updating our company branding to be clearer about the products that come from Facebook.</p>
      <p>“We’re introducing a new company logo and further distinguishing the Facebook company from the Facebook app, which will keep its own branding.”</p>

      <p>The new branding changes Facebook to FACEBOOK, and sees the distinctive blue design to a new multicolour alternative.</p>
      <p>This new branding will appear not only on the Facebook app, but also across several other Facebook-owned services, including WhatsApp, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , Messenger and Oculus.</p>
      <p>Mr Lucio added: “This brand change is a way to better communicate our ownership structure to the people and businesses who use our services to connect, share, build community and grow their audiences.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The change comes amid a storm of negative coverage for Facebook.</p>
      <p>For example, co-founder Mark Zuckerberg recently spoke before the House Financial Services Committee, where he sparked serious concerns about Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, Libra.</p>
      <p>And Facebook was also widely criticised for its political ad policy, which Zuckerberg stood by, despite rival <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> ’s decision to ban political ads.</p>
      <p>Many users have also been quick to mock the new branding, with some taking to Twitter to discuss the change.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: “I’m not mad about the Facebook rebrand, just sad I wasn’t on the team that did as little as humanly possible and walked away with a criminal amount of money.”</p>
      <p>Another joked: “Wow, they took this rebrand seriously! I just tried typing "facebook . com" into my browser, and got a 404. I had to type "FACEBOOK . COM" in all caps, and it worked.”</p>
      <p>And one added: “Facebook’s move to FACEBOOK is clearly a rebrand for their boomer base that can’t figure out how to turn off caps lock.”</p>
