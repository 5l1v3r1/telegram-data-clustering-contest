      <h1>Call for inquiry into Dublin's water quality as boil-water notice re-issued</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:30:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A Green Party MEP is calling for the Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy to order an inquiry into water quality in the greater Dublin area.</p>
      <p>Last night, <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/boil-water-notice-re-issued-for-600000-people-961807.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">a boil water notice for 600,000 people in Dublin, Meath and Kildare was re-issued</a>, two weeks after it was first put in place.</p>
      <p>Irish Water expects the notice to be in place for a number of days after heavy rain affected water quality at the Leixlip Treatment Plant.</p>
      <p>The utility said that due to heavy rain, turbidity in the source water for the old Leixlip Plant exceeded acceptable levels.</p>
      <p>They added that plant operators reacted quickly before alarms were activated and shut down the old plant to stop this water entering the network.</p>
      <p>Turbidity is cloudiness in water due to suspended particles.</p>
      <p>MEP Ciarán Cuffe wants Mr Murphy to establish an inquiry to look into the agencies responsible.</p>
      <p>"I think he should look at the competencies within all three organisations," said Mr Cuffe.</p>
      <p>"Are we losing a lot of senior staff? Do we have people with the right qualifications overseeing the production of water in the Leixlip plant?</p>
      <p>"Or have we simply lost out on a level of competency with retirement and with changes in personnel?"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, TDs will be told today that several alarms at the Leixlip plant “were not responded to”, leading to the country's largest-ever boil water notice last month.</p>
      <p>The Oireachtas Housing Committee will tomorrow hear evidence from Irish Water, the Environmental Protection Agency and Fingal County Council as to how the catastrophic failure first occurred last month.</p>
