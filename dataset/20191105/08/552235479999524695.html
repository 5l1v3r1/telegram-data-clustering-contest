      <h1>Charlie Nicholas makes Celtic vs Rangers call as he delivers Betfred Cup prediction</h1>
      <h2>The pundit has outlined why he believes Neil Lennon’s side will win their 10th straight trophy.</h2>

      <p>Former Celtic striker <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charlie-nicholas">Charlie Nicholas</a> can’t wait for his old team and Rangers to meet at Hampden.</p>
      <p>The two Glasgow giants will face off at the National Stadium in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup Final</a> on December 8 for the chance to win the first silverware of the season.</p>
      <p>Nicholas doesn’t see much between the sides – but he reckons <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> will edge out <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .</p>
      <p>He knows the situation could change in the four weeks between now and the showdown but has explained why he feels Neil Lennon’s side will win their 10th straight trophy.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old, writing in his <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/">Daily Star</a> column, said: "The Betfred Cup Final between Rangers and Celtic should be some game.</p>

      <p>"It was hardly a surprise to see Celtic and Rangers cruise through their semi-finals against Hibs and Hearts.</p>
      <p>"As is stands, the final looks a very evenly-matched encounter.</p>
      <p>"There doesn't seem to be much between either side and they are both in good form.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We just have to wait and see what the next few weeks bring, in terms of injuries, form and their European involvement.</p>
      <p>"If I was to have to make a call on it right now I would go Celtic.</p>
      <p>"I would only edge towards them because I think they have more strength in depth.</p>
      <p>"It really is a meeting of two giants.</p>
      <p>"It is also the chance for Steven Gerrard to pick up his first silverware although the league is the prize he really craves."</p>
      <p>Rangers travel to face Aberdeen four days before the Hampden showpiece while Celtic are at home to Hamilton.</p>
