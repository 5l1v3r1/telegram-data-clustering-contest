      <h1>Netflix introduces button to skip Trump jokes in new Seth Meyers comedy special</h1>
      <h2>New feature is perfect if you're tired of hearing about the US president</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:11:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Stolworthy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/netflix?CMP=ILC-refresh">Netflix</a> has introduced a button that lets viewers skip jokes about US president Donald Trump on a new comedy special from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a>.</p>
      <p>The comedian and chat show host’s new comedy special, titled <i>Lobby Baby</i>, sees him take aim at the president, whom he previously branded a “racist gargoyle”.</p>
      <p>Meyers told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html"><i>CNN Business</i></a> that it was his idea to introduce the feature, deeming a politics joke-avoiding button as “a funny and innovative way” to “take advantage of the Netflix experience”.</p>
      <p>“It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, ‘Oh, let me guess, there’s going to be jokes about the president’,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meyers described the button as a “joke”, adding: “I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they’ll put parsley on your plate and you’ll think, well, that’s a nice touch, but you’re not going to eat the parsley.”</p>
      <p>The host is a frequent critic of Trump. In July, Seth Meyers devoted eight minutes of his talk show condemning him for his spate of racist tweets aimed at progressive Democratic congresswomen <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ilhan-omar">Ilhan Omar</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ayanna-pressley">Ayanna Pressley</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rashida-tlaib">Rashida Tlaib</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Lobby Baby</i> will be available to stream on Netflix later today (5 November).</p>
