      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T08:19:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author">Louise Randell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/louise-randell/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/emma-watson">Emma Watson</a> has declared she's happily "self-partnered" and doesn't need a man to make her happy as she prepares for her upcoming 30th birthday.</p>
      <p>The Harry Potter star insisted she's not worried about the milestone, and has come up with a new phrase to describe her circumstances.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.vogue.com/magazine">Vogue</a> , Emma, 29, explained she's not worried about finding a man right now as she's perfectly content being partnered with herself.</p>
      <p>She said: "I was like, “Why does everyone make such a big fuss about turning 30? This is not a big deal”.</p>
      <p>"Cut to 29, and I’m like, 'Oh my God, I feel so stressed and anxious'.</p>
      <p>"And I realise it’s because there is suddenly this bloody influx of subliminal messaging around.</p>
      <p>"If you have not built a home, if you do not have a husband, if you do not have a baby, and you are turning 30, and you’re not in some incredibly secure, stable place in your career, or ‘I felt so stressed’ you’re still figuring things out...</p>

      <p>"There’s just this incredible amount of anxiety.</p>
      <p>"I never believed the whole 'I’m happy single' spiel. I was like, 'This is totally spiel'. It took me a long time, but I’m very happy [being single]. I call it being self-partnered."</p>
      <p>Although Emma has insisted she's single, just two weeks ago she was spotted kissing a mystery man outside a bakery in London.</p>

      <p>Her last boyfriend is said to have been Dominic Piazza after the pair were seen together in Los Angeles several in August.</p>
      <p>She's also said to have dated former Oculus chief executive Brendan Iribe, 40, and her former Potter co-star Tom Felton.</p>
      <p>Last year, she romanced actor Chord Overstreet for six months.</p>
