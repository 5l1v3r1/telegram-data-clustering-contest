      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/richard-gere">Richard Gere</a> is reportedly set to become a father again at 70.</p>
      <p>The Pretty Woman star is said to be expecting his second child with his wife Alejandra Silva, 36.</p>
      <p>Magazine <a href="https://www.hola.com/actualidad/20191104153134/richard-alejandra-gere-esperan-segundo-hijo/">Hola!</a> , in Alejandra's native Spain, reports that the couple are due to welcome another baby just nine months after the birth of their son Alexander.</p>
      <p>The publication reports she's three months down the line, having welcomed her and her husband's firstborn in February.</p>
      <p>They both have children from previous marriages, with Alejandra sharing six-year-old Albert with ex-husband Govind Friedland, and Richard already dad to Homer James Jigem, 19, who he shares with ex-wife Carey Lowell.</p>

      <p>Richard and Alejandra are yet to share their pregnancy news publicly, but last time they announced they had a baby on the way it was pretty special.</p>
      <p>Alejandra shared a snap of the Dalai Lama blessing her bump, writing: "Getting blessings for our precious to come… We couldn't announce it before telling HH Dalai Lama."</p>
      <p>Richard married Alejandra in April, last year, in a civil partner ceremony in Spain before celebrating with friends and loved ones back at the actor's ranch just outside New York City.</p>

      <p>The happy couple shared their wedding pictures with Hello! magazine.</p>
      <p>Alejandra said at the time: "I feel like I'm in a true fairytale. Without a doubt, I feel like the luckiest woman in the world."</p>
      <p>Richard, who won Alejandra over by repeatedly sending her flowers until she agreed to go on a date, added: "I'm the happiest man in the universe.</p>
