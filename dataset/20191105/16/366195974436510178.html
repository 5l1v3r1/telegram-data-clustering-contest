      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/berner/profile">Berner</a> and Mozzy joined forces earlier this year for their joint project, <i>Slimey Individualz</i>. The California natives came through with a dope project from top to bottom but following its release, they continued to release their own solo work. Now, they've returned together at least for a new single off of Berner's forthcoming project, <i>La Plaza</i>. Over chilly yet soulful production, the two rappers detail a bleak reality while flexing their storytelling skills on "3 Deep." Berner and Mozzy share tales of robbing and running through the streets.</p>
      <p>Berner's new project dives deeper into his Latin heritage with appearances from Jon Z, De La Ghetto, and Nengo Flow. Other features on the project include <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/SnoopDogg/profile">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/WizKhalifa/profile">Wiz Khalifa</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ChrisBrown/profile">Chris Brown</a>, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/FatJoe/profile">Fat Joe</a>, Cypress Hill, Mozzy, OMB Peezy, Nef The Pharaoh, Lil Pete, and more.</p>
      <p><u><b>Quotable Lyrics<br/></b></u>They say the out of town plays are the move<br/>I'm on my way to the A<br/>Three deep in a van, the whole thing full of weight<br/>No smokin' in the whip, the small towns feel sketchy<br/>We should open up a bag, yeah I know, it sounds tempting</p>
