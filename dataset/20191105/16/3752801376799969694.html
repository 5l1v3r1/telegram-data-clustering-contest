      <p>No arrests have yet been made after a 13-year-old girl was hit and injured by a stray bullet in Hanover Park, Western Cape police said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The girl had been walking from the shop in Athburg Walk around 14:00 on Monday when she was wounded in the arm and stomach, said Sergeant Noloyiso Rwexana.</p>
      <p>She was rushed to a medical facility for treatment.</p>
      <p>Rwexana said the circumstances surrounding the shooting were being investigated.</p>
      <p>Last month, a 15-year-old girl was injured after being hit by a stray bullet just a few roads away in Rywood Road.</p>
      <p>She had apparently been standing on the street corner with two people - one an alleged gangster - when a rival group spotted him and opened fire, <a href="https://ewn.co.za/2019/10/24/hanover-park-girl-15-shot-in-gang-crossfire">Eyewitness News</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Philippi community police forum chair Ebrahim Abrahams said the girl was recovering.</p>
      <p>He said it had been a gang shooting and that the area was a hotspot for this activity, with two law enforcement officers shot dead in the same vicinity.</p>
      <p>The Philippi policing precinct was identified as one of 10 crime hotspots and the South African National Defence Force was deployed in July to help curb the high murder rate.</p>
      <p>According to police crime statistics for 2018/2019, the Philippi police station saw a 55.3% increase in attempted murder cases.</p>
