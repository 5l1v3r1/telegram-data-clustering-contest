      <h1>Almost half of California Republicans may flee state over high taxes and liberal policies</h1>

      <p>Over half of registered voters in California have seriously considered leaving the state largely because of its liberal policies and high taxes.</p>
      <p>The U.C. Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-04/california-conservatives-republicans-leaving">polled</a> registered voters across the Golden State on how seriously they have considered joining the exodus to new states, according to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. The poll found that over half of registered voters have seriously considered moving, and that right-wing voters are three times more likely to consider moving than left-wing voters.</p>
      <p>The poll found 40% of Republican and conservative voters have considered relocating to redder states, citing solid Democratic control of the government and the state's high taxes. Comparatively, 14% of Democratic and liberal voters have seriously considered moving.</p>
      <p>"We're moving to redder pastures," said 71-year-old Judy Stark as she and her husband left California for a new home near Dallas, Texas. "We're getting with people who believe in the same political agenda that we do: America first, Americans first, law and order."</p>
      <p>Residents have <a href="https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/265">flooded</a> out of California in recent years as housing costs and general expenses continue to grow for people living in the state. From 2007 to 2016, 1 million residents left California destined for states such as Texas and Idaho, according to a 2018 state Legislative Analystâ€™s Office report on domestic migration in and out of the state.</p>
