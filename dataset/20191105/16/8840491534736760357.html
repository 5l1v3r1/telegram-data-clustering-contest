      <p>THE ongoing Mayo GAA dispute took another turn today (Tuesday) when Charlestown Sarsfields GAA issued a statement in response to last night's county board meeting.</p>
      <p>They say a motion of confidence was not voted on at the meeting, and the club also hit out at the exclusion of the press from the meeting.</p>
      <p>The full statement from the club – published on its website and social media platforms - reads:</p>
      <p>“Following a county board meeting held last night, the 4th of November 2019 in McHale Park, a statement released by the PRO stated that a motion of confidence in the Executive had been passed with the 'overwhelming support' of the delegates.</p>
      <p>“We have been contacted by a number of club members in relation to this issue. It is our understanding that a motion was proposed by an honorary county board officer who is not a club delegate and seconded by a delegate, but that no vote was held on this very important motion.</p>
      <p>“Our club delegate did not vote on this proposal nor was he given the opportunity and we would ask the County Board Executive to clarify last night's statement.</p>
      <p>“We also cannot condone the exclusion of the media from last night's meeting and the proposal to ban then from all future meetings.”</p>
