      <p>MELBOURNE:Â Australian gelding Vow and Declare won the coveted A$8.0 million (US$5.5 million) Melbourne Cup at Flemington on Tuesday as revelations about the grim fate of retired racehorses were put to one side as punters streamed through the turnstiles.</p>
      <p>With veteran jockey Craig Williams in the saddle, the four-year-old ended a decade of international domination in a thrilling finish to edge out Prince of Arran, Il Paradiso and Master of Reality in a thrilling finish to the famous 3,200-metre (two mile) "Race that stops a nation".</p>

      <p>Twilight Payment set the pace until the Danny O'Brien-trained Vow and Declare got up on the line to upset a field packed with overseas runners and containing only two Australian-bred horses.</p>
      <p>"I was lucky enough to sit on Vow And Declare. A credit to Danny O'Brien," said Williams, who has now won the Melbourne Cup to go with the Cox Plate, Caulfield Cup and Golden Slipper during an illustrious career.</p>
      <p>"It was a privilege to ride him today. We had a difficult barrier draw but we trusted him. We knew what we can do. Great to be associated with a horse like this."</p>
      <p>
        <b>STEWARDS PROTEST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Master of Reality, ridden by Frankie Dettori, crossed the line second in a photo finish ahead of British raider Prince of Arran and American stallion Il Paradiso.</p>
      <p>But a stewards' protest over interference by Dettori in the final 100 metres was upheld with Prince of Arran elevated to second, Il Paradiso to third and Master of Reality relegated to fourth.</p>
      <p>O'Brien, who gave Vow and Declare a light spring campaign of just two runs before Tuesday, paid tribute to Williams.</p>
      <p>"An amazingly special thing to happen," he said.</p>
      <p>"I feel incredibly blessed to have a horse good enough to be in it and then for him to be ridden so beautifully by Craig.</p>
      <p>"He rolled the dice like he does, he's an outstanding jockey."</p>
      <p>First staged in 1861, the Melbourne Cup has been run on the first Tuesday of November since 1876, and the winning horse instantly becomes a household name in Australia.</p>
      <p>It is a cultural institution and tens of thousands of well-dressed punters flock to Flemington, with boozy parties held nationwide.</p>
      <p>The race was run this year with the industry under extreme scrutiny following damning revelations about the fate of retired racehorses.</p>

      <p>While slaughtering horses instead of rehoming is not illegal in Australia, an undercover probe by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation alleged the practice was far more widespread than acknowledged.</p>
      <p>It detailed healthy horses being brutalised at one abattoir before being killed on an "industrial scale", with their meat shipped overseas for human and pet consumption.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FANS UNDETERRED</b>
      </p>
      <p>It sent shockwaves through the industry, which pledged to do better.</p>
      <p>But racegoers seemed largely undeterred as 81,408 packed into heaving grandstands, slightly down on last year's attendance of 83,471, with bookmakers predicting more than three million Australians would have a flutter.</p>
      <p>The Melbourne Cup was not directly linked to those slaughterhouses though the race had already been a target of animal rights activists because of the deaths of six horses at the race meeting since 2013.</p>

      <p>There were no fatalities on Tuesday but Irish five-year-old Rostropovich pulled up lame with a fractured pelvis after finishing last.</p>
      <p>Racing Victoria said in a statement that she was "comfortable and receiving the best veterinary care".</p>
      <p>It is not just in Australia that horse racing is feeling the heat - a thoroughbred was euthanised after being injured in the US during the high-profile Breeder's Cup Classic at Santa Anita at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Mongolian Groom was the 37th horse to die since December at the California track, a grim toll that has sparked outrage, an investigation by law enforcement authorities and dire warnings about racing's future from federal legislators.</p>
