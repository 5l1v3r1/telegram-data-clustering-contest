      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Passengers and the driver of a Madison Metro bus were startled Monday afternoon when a man ran into the road, jumped into the window of a bus and ran away, police said.</p>
      <p>According to an incident report, the bus driver spotted the man running in traffic down the middle of the road on N. Lake Street at 3:55 p.m. When the driver stopped the bus, 32-year-old Jeffrey Jefferson jumped up, seriously damaging the front window of the bus. Jefferson ran away, seemingly uninjured, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Police said surveillance footage helped them identify the man as someone they had dealt with earlier that day in a downtown panhandling and trespassing complaint. According to the report, Jefferson was spotted outside the Madison Public Library on Mifflin Street. He struggled with officers before being taken into custody.</p>
      <p>Jefferson was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct, damage to property, resisting/obstructing and bail jumping.</p>
      <p>The damage to the bus is estimated to be $1,200, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Police said the passengers on the bus were loaded onto a different bus to continue their travel.</p>
