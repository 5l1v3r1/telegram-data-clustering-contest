      <p>A man allegedly ran the "Deliveroo of sexual services" by transporting vulnerable women to meetings across Northern Ireland, the High Court has heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed six victims have now emerged in a case which involved them being advertised online for unprotected, risky sex.</p>
      <p>Some of them were homeless, spent time in care or addicted to drugs, a judge was told.</p>
      <p>Details emerged as Martin Heaney was refused bail on human trafficking and controlling prostitution charges from which he is suspecting of amassing up to £140,000.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old, of Maypole Park in Dromore, Co Down, denies the offences, telling police he was just an unpaid driver.</p>
      <p>He was arrested on September 29 as part of a major probe by the PSNI's modern slavery unit.</p>
      <p>The investigation centres on activities over a two-year period stretching back to October 2017, when adverts appeared on a website allegedly linked to Heaney.</p>
      <p>During that period nearly £140,000 was deposited into his bank accounts, the court heard.</p>
      <p>He currently faces three counts of human trafficking and three counts of controlling prostitution for gain.</p>
      <p>Further charges include acquiring criminal property, brothel keeping and paying for sexual services.</p>
      <p>The alleged offences involve driving women to encounters in Omagh, Dungannon, Limavady, Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus.</p>
      <p>With inquiries ongoing, Crown lawyer Samuel Magee said: "At present there are six victims, each of whom has co-operated with the police investigation."</p>
      <p>During questioning Heaney insisted his only involvement was to collect and take some of them to destinations around Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>But according to the prosecution he can be "overwhelmingly" linked through CCTV and telephone evidence, along with financial documents and website information.</p>
      <p>Peter Coiley, defending, stressed his client denies any involvement in sexual activities.</p>
      <p>"He indicated his role was simply an unpaid driver," counsel submitted.</p>
      <p>The court was also told that cash found in the accused's bank account can be explained from the £130,000 sale of his late father's home.</p>
      <p>Bail was refused.</p>
