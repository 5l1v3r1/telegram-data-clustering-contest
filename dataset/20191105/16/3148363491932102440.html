      <h1>Nearly 500 Convicts Freed in Oklahoma in Largest Jailbreak in History</h1>
      <h2>Close to 500 convicts in prison across the state of Oklahoma were released in the largest single-day jailbreak in United States history.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:54:37+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">John Binder</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, state officials in Oklahoma <a href="https://www.koco.com/article/more-than-400-oklahoma-inmates-to-be-released-from-prison-monday/29683036">released</a> 462 inmates who had their sentences commuted after Republican and Democrat lawmakers passed criminal justice reform legislation this year.</p>
      <p>In total, nearly 530 inmates have already had their sentences commuted by the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board. Those released were in prison after being convicted for “non-violent crimes” such as drug possession.</p>
      <p>Critics of jailbreak, though, have long argued that supposed “non-violent” convicted criminals have often committed violent crimes and merely pleaded down to misdemeanors to escape hefty prison sentences.</p>
      <p>The mass release of convicts in Oklahoma comes as jailbreaks increasingly occur in the U.S., led by the “First Step Act,” which President Trump signed into law this year following a huge lobbying effort by Republicans, Democrats, progressives, libertarian think tanks, and celebrities like Kim Kardashian West.</p>
      <p>The First Step Act, as Breitbart News has <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/29/accused-murderer-freed-by-first-step-act-instantly-returned-to-drug-life/">chronicled</a>, released a former “Latin Kings” gang leader, Joel Francisco, who immediately returned to a life of drugs after being freed from federal prison. Now, Francisco has been <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/25/latin-kings-gang-leader-freed-by-first-step-act-arrested-for-murder-after-nationwide-manhunt/">arrested</a> for murdering a man in Rhode Island.</p>
      <p>In November 2018, Breitbart News reported that the First Step Act would result in the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/11/14/prison-release-legislation-to-reduce-sentencing-for-drug-traffickers/">release</a> of thousands of drug traffickers from prison despite their dealing deadly drugs such as fentanyl and heroin. A report this year by Fox News’s Tucker Carlson stated that the First Step Act had successfully <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/07/26/report-first-step-act-frees-hundreds-of-sex-offenders-convicted-murderers/">released</a> about 240 sex offenders, nearly 60 convicted murderers and assailants, as well as almost 1,000 inmates convicted for drug crimes.</p>
