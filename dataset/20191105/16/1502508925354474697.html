      <p>Senior off-spinner <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ravichandran-ashwin">Ravichandran Ashwin </a>is all set to join <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-capitals">Delhi Capitals </a>in a trade off with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kings-xi-punjab">Kings XI Punjab </a>for the upcoming season of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indian-premier-league">Indian Premier League </a>in 2020.</p>
      <p>Ashwin, who had captained the KXIP for two seasons without much success, was supposed to join <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-capitals">Delhi Capitals </a>earlier but once Anil Kumble came on board, it was learnt that KXIP weren't ready to release their senior bowler.</p>
      <p>"Yes, Ashwin is joining <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-capitals">Delhi Capitals.</a> The deal had earlier fell through as KXIP didn't get the two DC players that they wanted in a trade-off with Ashwin. Now they are getting those two players and it's 99 percent done," a senior BCCI official, privy to IPL trade-offs, told PTI on conditions of anonymity.</p>
      <p>However it couldn't be confirmed as to which two players Delhi will be trading.</p>
