      <p>MilanÂ  - Italian club<b> Verona</b> announced on Tuesday they have banned the leader of their hard-core ultras supporters group until June 2030 for saying that <b>Mario Balotelli </b>would never be "completely Italian".</p>
      <p>Verona said that Luca Castellini was barred from their stadium "based on considerations and expressions seriously contrary to those that distinguish the ethical principles and values of our club".</p>
      <p>Brescia forward Balotelli threatened to leave the pitch on Sunday after being targeted by monkey chants from a section of Verona's supporters during a Serie A game.</p>
      <p>Castellini made racist comments on Monday directed at the 29-year-old Italian forward during a radio interview.</p>
      <p>"Balotelli's Italian because he has Italian citizenship, but he can never be completely Italian," said Castellini.</p>
      <p>When asked if Verona fans were racist, Castellini added: "We have a negro in our team and he scored yesterday and all of Verona applauded."</p>
      <p>Despite denials of abuse from Verona, a video published on Twitter showed a number of supporters directing abuse at Balotelli before the forward booted the ball at them in the stands.</p>
      <p>Balotelli, who was born in Palermo to Ghanaian parents but was raised just outside Brescia, had to be held back by players from both teams to stop him leaving the pitch.</p>
      <p>"Balotelli's a clown. He only heard it in his own head," continued Castellini.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester City and Inter Milan striker Balotelli, who obtained Italian citizenship at the age of 18, has been capped 36 times for Italy.</p>
