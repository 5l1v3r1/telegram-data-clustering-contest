      <p>The separated directional buttons found on the Nintendo Switch's left Joy-Con have been something of talking point ever since the console launched in 2017 - some people like them, some <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/08/soapbox_seriously_nintendo_its_time_for_a_switch_joy-con_with_a_proper_d-pad"><i>really don't like them</i></a>, and some simply put up with them because single Joy-Con multiplayer would be impossible without them.</p>
      <p>The 'really don't like them' camp has definitely been the most vocal over the past couple of years, though, and demand for an official Joy-Con with added D-Pad is pretty high (although you can pick up <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/08/hardware_review_hori_d-pad_joy-con_controller_for_nintendo_switch">third-party alternatives</a>). Hopping on that demand is accessory maker, Nyko, which has now released its 'Dockable Protective Case with D-pad Cover for Nintendo Switch', <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/01/this_new_switch_case_protects_your_console_and_gives_it_a_proper_d-pad_at_the_same_time">first revealed</a> back in January.</p>
      <p>It's pretty obvious how it works from the images, so we'll let those do the talking:</p>

      <p>You can get your own for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nyko-Dpad-Case-Dockable-Protective-Nintendo/dp/B07SRWGH38/?tag=nlife-20">$12.99</a> at the time of writing, although the singular review found on the product's store listing was less than happy with the product they received.</p>
