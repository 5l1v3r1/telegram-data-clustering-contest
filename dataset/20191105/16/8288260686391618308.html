      <p>Rangers fans are having their say on the future of in-form striker Alfredo Morelos, as speculation continues to link him with Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The Colombian took his eye-catching tally for 2019-20 up to 20 goals from 24 matches on Saturday, netting twice in a 5-2 Scottish League Cup win over Hearts.</p>
      <p>Gers boss <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alfredo-morelos-aston-villa-transfer-17193842">Steven Gerrard responded</a> to talk of a potential move away from Ibrox for Morelos on BT Sport recently, saying: "I'm not confident, I'm sure. I'm 100 per cent sure he's not going anywhere."</p>
      <p>Former Rangers and Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Alex Rae took to Twitter after Gerrard's comments to celebrate the hopes of Morelos staying in the Scottish Premiership, amid the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> rumours.</p>

      <p>"Beaming Rangers boss Steven Gerrard has delivered an emphatic transfer message and insists star man Alfredo Morelos is going nowhere in January. That will be that then."</p>
      <p>Rangers fans have since taken to social media to give their thoughts on Morelos' future.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's a selection of what they have been saying...</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>John-o'neill:</b> All Rangers fans know he's gonna get sold but hopefully not in January still better things to come</p>
      <p><b>Craig Braid:</b> He’ll be away in the summer he’s going nowhere this season</p>
      <p><b>James Moore:</b> Music to many ears the boy is on course for 40 this season</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@andyb29:</b> Money talks tho Alex....... hope not!</p>
      <p><b>@Testerofwells:</b> It won’t be that, if someone comes in and sends us the valuation he’s gone</p>
      <p><b>Lawrelos:</b> £20m bid, he will be off!</p>
      <p><b>MartyFunkhouser:</b> Shows his naivety (and yours). If a club comes in and Morelos wants to go then it will not be so simple.</p>
