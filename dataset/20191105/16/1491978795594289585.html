        <i>• Deal lasts two seasons for 58-Test former All Black<br/>• Toronto expected to confirm signing in London next week</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/sonny-bill-williams">Sonny Bill Williams</a> will be unveiled as the highest-paid player in the history of either code of rugby next week after agreeing a two-year deal with Toronto Wolfpack. The 34-year-old has agreed to return to the 13-man code with the Super League newcomers, who will pay him a reported £2.6m annual salary – a figure which exceeds the total annual spend of every other league club in the northern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>Only £150,000 of Williams’ wages will count on the salary cap due to the marquee-player ruling, which was implemented to attract major signings into the competition. The dual-code international’s signature for the Wolfpack supersedes any other deal struck in the competition’s history.</p>
      <p>Toronto, who have made no secret of their desire to revolutionise league since their formation in 2017, are expected to confirm his signing in London next week, having spent weeks negotiating a deal with Williams, who featured for New Zealand at the World Cup where the All Blacks lost to England in the semi-finals. The Wolfpack coach, Brian McDermott, met him midway through the tournament to try to convince him to sign for 2020.</p>
      <p>Williams’s return to league – the sport in which he began before departing for rugby union in 2008, then returning to league in 2013-14, winning the NRL title twice – means almost every single team the Wolfpack visit in 2020 receive a boost in gate receipts. Williams’ debut would probably come in a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/04/toronto-wolfpack-headingley-home-game-castleford-super-league"> double-header </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/04/toronto-wolfpack-headingley-home-game-castleford-super-league">at Headingley in February</a>, as the Wolfpack start against Castleford alongside a game between Leeds and Hull.</p>
