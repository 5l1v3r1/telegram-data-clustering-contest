      <h1>Middendorp Distances Himself From Chiefs History</h1>

      <p>Kaizer Chiefs coach Ernst Middendorp stopped short of distancing himself from the club’s current trophy drought, though he was already in charge when the Glamour Boys failed to beat TS Galaxy in the Nedbank Cup final last season.</p>

      <p>Middendorp is again edging ever closer to bringing a trophy to Naturena, having led Chiefs to victory over their bitter rivals Orlando Pirates to progress to the semifinals of the Telkom Knockout later this month.</p>
      <p>But the German born mentor said he was not getting carried away, and neither was he thinking too much about the past.  </p>
      <p>“I have nothing to do with the past five years. I came in during the December 2018 and I have only been here for 11 months,” Middendorp, who is in his second stint as Chiefs coach, told reporters after the Pirates win.</p>
      <p>“We certainly had some changes to make and there was a clear target to do better, much better. We worked on it, and at the moment I am not dreaming, but thinking already about Chippa United (tomorrow night).”</p>
