      <p>MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s federal police said on Tuesday that they had registered 42 new cases of bank fraud amounting to about 72 billion rupees ($1.02 billion) after conducting searches in 187 places across the country.</p>
      <p>The primarily loan fraud cases were detected at 15 banks, including the country’s largest state-run lender - State Bank of India, according to a statement by the Central Bureau of Investigation.</p>
      <p>State Bank of India was not immediately available for comment outside business hours.</p>
      <p>The police said of the 42 cases, four involved a fraud amount of more than 10 billion rupees each.</p>
      <p>A number of fraud cases have come to light at both state-run and private banks in India over the past two years, where the banking industry has already been grappling with nearly $150 billion in bad loans</p>
      <p>Last month, police alleged that Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC) had used more than 21,000 fictitious accounts (<a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-banking-pmc/indias-pmc-bank-created-over-21000-fake-accounts-to-hide-loans-complaint-idINKBN1WG43V">here</a>) to hide loans it made to a single real estate firm.</p>
      <p>Last year, India's second-biggest state-controlled lender, Punjab National Bank was hit by a $2 billion (<a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/india-fraud-punjab-natl-bank-exclusive/exclusive-lapses-at-many-levels-of-bank-led-to-indias-huge-pnb-fraud-internal-report-shows-idINKBN1JG009">here</a>) fraud after two jewelry groups used fake bank guarantees to raise billions of dollars in foreign credit.</p>
      <p>The alleged fraud cases registered by CBI on Tuesday mostly involved companies borrowing money using falsified accounts and forged documents and then siphoning off funds and defaulting on the repayments.</p>
      <p>“During searches, incriminating documents have been recovered so far,” CBI said in a statement.</p>
