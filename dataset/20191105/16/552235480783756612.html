      <h2>Victoria Watson feels learning the dance style will help to empower women.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:58:34+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Geddes, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jonathan-geddes/</a></address>
      <p>The organiser of a new dance class coming to Rutherglen believes it will tear a strip off the competition.</p>
      <p>And Victoria Watson feels her cheeky burlesque classes will help to empower women too.</p>
      <p>Victoria has been running the lessons in Bellshill for more than a year, and they will commence <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">in Rutherglen</a> this Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old – who goes by the stage name of Frivolity Vixen – spent her early childhood in Rutherglen. She first became interested in burlesque through visits to popular Glasgow club night Club Noir.</p>
      <p>After taking part in workshops organised by the club, Victoria, who has been a keen dancer since childhood, discovered she had a passion for the saucy style.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’d always danced, but obviously as you get older you start to do it less and less.</p>
      <p>“I really enjoyed doing it, and it allowed me to carry on dancing. It’s really gone from there and was something I wanted to do more of.”</p>
      <p>Some years later, Victoria, who is a logistics specialist with an IT company in her day job, decided it was time to establish her own classes.</p>
      <p>Victoria currently holds two in Bellshill, with 24 women in each, and she believes there are some misconceptions about the dance form that need to be cleared up.</p>

      <p>She explained: “People sometimes hear burlesque and think it’s the same as strippers, but it’s not – we are dancers first and foremost, and it’s very tongue in cheek.</p>
      <p>“Yes, it’s naughty but it’s without really exposing anything and it is more about having fun than anything else; from the dances to coming up with stage names.</p>
      <p>“This is something that is suitable for all ages, shapes and sizes.”</p>
      <p>Victoria says that many women who take up burlesque go on to develop improved confidence, while also socialising more.</p>
      <p>She added: “This can be really empowering.</p>
      <p>“You get young mums coming along who have had a health issue or perhaps who, have become a bit socially isolated since giving birth, and they feel that they are part of a family now because this brings them together.</p>
      <p>“I think that with burlesque it can give women their femininity back, because when you are performing it makes you feel good about yourself, about your body and who you are.</p>
      <p>“There’s a confidence you gain as you do this – you have girls who at the first class are sitting terrified at the back and then they’ll be up doing a striptease a few weeks later. </p>
      <p>“I hope I can bring some of that to Rutherglen.”</p>
      <p>As for her stage name, there’s an obvious reason for that...</p>
      <p>“Well, Vixen comes from Victoria, and Frivolity is because my mum always said I was too frivolous growing up.”</p>
      <p>Victoria’s first class will take place this Saturday, at 10am in the No 18 venue on Farmeloan Road.</p>
