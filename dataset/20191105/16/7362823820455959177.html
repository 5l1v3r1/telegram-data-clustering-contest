      <h1>Liberal Christian group attacks Barr speech as 'toxic Christianity'</h1>

      <p>U.S. Attorney general William Barr has come under fire from a liberal Christian group for a speech he made at Notre Dame University Law School. The group claims he violated his oath to defend religious liberty for all Americans.</p>
      <p>The group, called Faithful America, said Barr's speech was too focused on Christianity. They've filed a formal complaint with the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.</p>
      <p>Christopher Hale, a former Obama faith adviser, said while he supports the group, he contends they might have gone a bit far.</p>
      <p>"I'm friends of Faithful America. They're a good group, but I'm not with them on this," Hale said. "The progressive movement, the left, we oftentimes swing at every pitch. And I do not know why we're going after this, in particular."</p>

      <p>During Barr's <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-remarks-law-school-and-de-nicola-center-ethics">speech</a> delivered on October 11, he talked about how religion promotes moral discipline and virtue needed to support a free government.</p>
      <p>"First, it gives us the right rules to live by. The Founding generation were Christians. They believed that the Judeo-Christian moral system corresponds to the true nature of man," he said. "Those moral precepts start with the two great commandments – to Love God with your whole heart, soul, and mind; and to Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself."</p>
      <p>The group labeled Barr's speech "toxic Christian nationalism" and demanded that the DOJ remove the speech from its website and that Barr apologize and give a new speech outlining steps to combat "right-wing attacks on the religious liberty of Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, progressive Christians, American Indians, and atheists."</p>

      </p>
      <p>So far, the DOJ has not responded. But the group claims it's collected more than 14,000 signatures for its petition.</p>
      <p>The Rev. Frank Pavone, the founder and national director for Priests for Life, said: "They're talking about the defense of religious liberty. And it seems to me they're taking away some religious liberty from Attorney General Barr. I mean, religious liberty does not mean that everything that everybody says has to be somehow neutral or given equal time to every religion under the sun."</p>

      <p>Hale also added that this kind of attack could backfire and bleed over into the Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>“If the Democratic Party is made to be the party against God, the godless party, we are going to be in the minority," he said. "We have to be a party that has acceptance of people of all faith and people of no faith.”</p>
