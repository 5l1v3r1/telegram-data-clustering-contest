      <h1>European Union Drafts Law Suggesting Consideration of Eurocoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:52:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>A draft document issued by the European Union suggests that the union should consider issuing its own digital currency.</p>
      <h3>Will the EU wage war on crypto?</h3>
      <p>Reuters <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-eu-cryptocurrency-regulations/alarmed-by-libra-eu-to-look-into-issuing-public-digital-currency-draft-idUKKBN1XF1VC">reported</a> on Nov. 5 that the draft in question — which is still subject to amendments — urges member states to develop a common approach to cryptocurrencies, possibly banning high-risk projects.</p>
      <p>If the draft in its current form is approved, which could happen as early as next month, it could have far-reaching consequences. More precisely, Reuters suggests that such a law could escalate into an EU regulatory campaign against cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <h3>European Central Bank to consider Eurocoin</h3>
      <p>The draft prepared by the Finnish EU presidency also suggests that the European Central Bank should consider issuing its own digital currency:</p>
      <blockquote>“The ECB and other EU central banks could usefully explore the opportunities as well as challenges of issuing central bank digital currencies including by considering concrete steps to this effect.”</blockquote>
      <p>The draft will be discussed this Friday, and perspective on its adoption will be presented on Dec. 5.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/eu-and-libra-facebooks-project-getts-challenged-as-eurocoin-looms">reported</a> in a dedicated analysis in late September, Europe’s digital currency is being increasingly seen as an answer to Facebook’s Libra stablecoin.</p>
