      <p>A man with a gun barricaded himself inside a home on Marshall Road causing a stand-off with Abbotsford police on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>“A 6 ½ hour standoff ensued with the suspect eventually emerging from the residence. The suspect was taken into custody without further incident,” said an Abbotsford Police Department social media post.</p>
      <p>The stand-off began at 12 a.m. and appeared to stem from a mental health issue, according to Const. Rob Dyck, media officer for the Abbotsford Police Department.</p>
      <p>“He initially called us for help and now he doesn’t want to come out,” Dyck said before the man was taken into custody.</p>
      <p>Neighbours reportedly heard police using a megaphone to try and get the man to come outside.</p>
      <p>The man faces numerous weapons charges and the investigation is ongoing, according to the police department’s social media post.</p>
      <p>Marshall Road was cordoned off from Old Yale Road to McMillan Road by emergency crews for hours but is now clear.</p>
