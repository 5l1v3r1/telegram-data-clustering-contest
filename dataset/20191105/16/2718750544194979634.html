      <p>Just in time for your 4:45 p.m. sundown-induced seasonal affective disorder comes the sunniest, most alliterative letter-B trailer since <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/beach-bum-movie-martin-lawrence-dolphins.html"><i>Beach Bum</i></a><i>: </i>It’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/bad-boys-for-life-trailer-martin-lawrence-will-smith.html"><i>Bad Boys for Life</i></a><i>. </i>Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are partnered up and buddy-copping all over again, and they look positively California radiant as they crack jokes and take down the Romanian mob. This <i>Bad Boys </i>threequel trailer shows Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowery (Smith) getting saddled with a hot young special-ops team called “AMMO,” which Smith calls “a <i>High School Musical </i>boy band with guns.” First, take note, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/disney-reveals-catalogue-of-streaming-movies.html">Disney+</a>. Second, AMMO includes Charles Melton and Vanessa Hudgens, which begs the question: If <i>High School Musical </i>exists in the <i>Bad Boys-</i>verse, but Vanessa Hudgens doesn’t, who played Gabriella Montez? Did AMMO agent Maya “Lethal Gun” Dunsmore get her start as a teen triple threat? Internal logic aside, this trailer shows us a more mature, grown-up version of the <i>Bad Boys: </i>Lawrence says “family is the only thing that matters,” like some kind of a <a href="http://vulture.com/2019/08/fast-and-furious-movies-ranked.html"><i>Fast and Furious</i></a><i> </i>character. He calls his wife! He worries about the extent of the damage that action sequences do to his wife’s car! More like Bad Boys for <i>Wife! </i>The trailer also has that greatest of all sight gags, a <a href="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/3/39/Aristocats-disneyscreencaps_com-2080.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130720155318">dog in a sidecar</a>. Until its release on January 17, 2020, we’ll leave you with one more gleeful gem from the trailer, courtesy of Smith doing wheelies in a Porsche: “Even the Batmobile don’t hold the road like this bitch!” You hear that, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/robert-pattinson-on-batman-anxiety-the-lighthouse.html">Robert Pattinson</a>?</p>
