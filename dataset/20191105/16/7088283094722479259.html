        <b>Nigerian police have released 259 people held captive at an Islamic rehabilitation center in the southwestern city of Ibadan, a police spokesman said on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oyo state police spokesman Fadeyi Olugbenga said the facility was raided on Monday. “Yesterday, 259 persons were released,” he said, adding that they were locked in a building and some were chained.</p>
      <p>He said nine people including the owner had been arrested and were under investigation.</p>

        <b>One meal a day</b>
      </p>
      <p>Images from local <a href="http://wwitv.com/tv_channels/b6607-TVC-News.htm">TV station TVC</a> taken shortly after the captives were released showed a group of mostly young men and teenaged boys. An infant was also among the group. Many were emaciated.</p>
      <p>“We eat one meal a day,” one of the men told TVC.</p>
      <p>Many captives have said they were physically and sexually abused and chained up to prevent them escaping.</p>
      <p>The raids are increasingly embarrassing for President Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim who has called on police to crack down on such centers.</p>

      <p>More than 1,000 people have been<a href="http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20191018-nigeria-shock-police-free-hundreds-boys-koranic-school-horror-almajiri-torture-abuse"> released from such centers </a>in Nigeria in the last few weeks. However, the others have been in the predominantly Muslim north of the country, rather than the southern states that are mostly inhabited by Christians.</p>
      <p>The raid will increase pressure on <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/africa/20190426-nigeria-s-president-commissions-unfinished-projects">President Muhammadu Buhari</a> to take action on loosely regulated centers that offer rehabilitation services and often an Islamic education. He has already called on police to shut down such centers.</p>
