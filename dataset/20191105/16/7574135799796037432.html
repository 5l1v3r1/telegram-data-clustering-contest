      <p><b>My Chemical Romance</b> recently revealed they’d be <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/what-are-my-chemical-romance-teasing/">reuniting this year</a>, and they announced one show happening in LA on December 20, which <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tickets-for-my-chemical-romances-la-reunion-show-on-sale/">sold out immediately</a>. We figured more dates would be announced soon, and today that turned out to be true. MCR have expanded their reunion to include a headlining slot at Australia’s <a href="https://www.moshtix.com.au/v2/download-festival?skin=Download"><b>Download Festival</b></a> in March (alongside Deftones, Jimmy Eat World, and many others), and right after that they’re playing a headlining <a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www.ticketmaster.co.nz/event/2400576580E5143F">New Zealand show</a> on 3/25 with Jimmy Eat World, Midnight Youth, and Miss June. Presumably even more shows (including more US dates) will be announced soon. Stay tuned!</p>
      <p>Update: They’re also playing <a href="https://www.downloadfestivaljapan.com/ja"><b>Japan’s Download Festival</b></a> with Jimmy Eat World, The Offspring, At The Gates, and more.</p>
      <p>As for Jimmy Eat World, they have a <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/tours-announced-korn-jimmy-eat-world-the-raconteurs-gif-from-god-more/">bunch of tour dates</a> coming up in support of this year’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/muffs-jimmy-eat-world-common-holly-from-indian-lakes-battles-floating-pointsreviews/"><i>Surviving</i></a>, including NY/NJ shows this month and the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/vampire-weekend-jimmy-eat-world-more-playing-alt-92-3-show-at-barclays/">ALT 92.3 holiday show</a> at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center with Vampire Weekend in December.</p>
