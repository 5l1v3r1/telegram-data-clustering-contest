      <p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” An ambush near the United States-Mexico border Tuesday morning <a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/kck-attorney-says-family-among-those-killed-in-mexico">claimed the lives of family members of a Kansas City, Kansas, attorney.</a></p>
      <p>Denise LeBaron-Ramos, who has offices near downtown Kansas City, Kansas, released as statement Tuesday afternoon saying that her family members were among the three women, four children and two infants killed.</p>
      <p>LeBaron-Ramos planned to make a statement to the media later Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Nine members of a Mormon family were killed on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border, and authorities are investigating whether the attack was the result of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>The victims include three women, four small children and two infants, family member Alex LeBaron said from Mexico. All nine were dual US-Mexican citizens, he said.</p>
      <p>The victims were "all shot while in vehicles while driving," LeBaron told CNN. Several children survived the attack.</p>
