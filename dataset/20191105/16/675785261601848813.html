      <h1>Man Utd eye Dwight McNeil transfer swoop - after releasing Burnley winger five years ago</h1>
      <h2>After being released by Manchester United aged 14, Dwight McNeil went on to join Burnley where he has impressed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T16:16:51+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 16:16</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly keen on bringing Burnley's teenage winger Dwight McNeil back to Old Trafford - after releasing the youngster five years ago.</p>
      <p>After being axed by United's youth side aged 14, McNeil went on to join the Clarets where he has developed into an integral part of Sean Dyche's first-team squad.</p>
      <p>McNeil, 19, has played in all 11 of Burnley's Premier League matches this campaign and scored one goal. - performances that have seemingly impressed United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10283752/man-utd-transfer-interest-dwight-mcneil-35m-burnley-winger/">The Sun</a> , the Norwegian boss has ordered United scouts to watch the England U21s international on numerous occasions this season.</p>

      <p>That is despite the fact he was released by the club for not being up to standards, while United's youth-team chiefs also had reservations about his ability on set-pieces.</p>
      <p>It is understood that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> are in no mood to sell their prized asset, who they value at around £35million.</p>
      <p>McNeil is a huge Red Devils fan and last month opened up on his release by United.</p>
      <p>He told The Sun: "I was released by Man United when I was 14.</p>

      <p>"Funnily enough, one of the reasons I got released was because my set-pieces weren’t the best.</p>
      <p>"It was quite an upsetting time for me. I was still at school as well, I was still learning.</p>
      <p>"I came to Burnley, got put on a six-week trial and signed just before the end of the season.</p>
      <p>"I’m a Man United fan, despite what happened. I’ll always be a Man United fan. I just wasn’t up to their standards."</p>
