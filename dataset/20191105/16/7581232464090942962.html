      </p>
      <p>This webinar will focus on how advanced technologies from SCIEX, both within the mass spectrometer itself and companion technologies at the front end of analysis, can be used to address today’s common analytical problems of sample throughput, ease of extraction and matrix interferences. <br/><br/>Emphasis will be placed on microflow chromatography, ion mobility separations and linear ion trap (QTRAP) technologies. Attendees will discover how these technologies assist with real-world analytical challenges, facilitating ease of use and simplicity of workflow advancements in the modern clinical laboratory.<br/><br/>Key learning objectives:<br/>- Sample preparation and matrix interference issues, and how they manifest<br/>- Chromatography and throughput issues and how they manifest<br/>- Theory and applications of microflow chromatography, ion mobility and QTRAP technologies</p>
