      <p>Former chancellor Philip Hammond has announced he will be standing down as an <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/tory-toff-jacob-rees-mogg-20815835">MP</a> .</p>
      <p>Mr Hammond had the whip removed by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-shuts-down-nicola-20801072">Boris Johnson</a> after voting to block a no-deal Brexit and he was not one of the 10 Tories to be reinstated before last week's General Election announcement.</p>
      <p>It means he would not have been able to have stand as a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/tories-refuse-sack-candidate-who-20807809">Conservative</a> candidate at the upcoming December 12 election or else face total expulsion from the party he has "supported all my adult life".</p>

      <p>With Parliament being dissolved for the election campaign just after midnight, Mr Hammond has called time on his two decades in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>He previously served as foreign, defence and transport secretary under David Cameron before being given the keys to Number 11 Downing Street by Theresa May.</p>
      <p>He resigned the role after Conservative MPs chose Mr Johnson to replace Mrs May as Prime Minister and has been a critic of the new administration's tactics since becoming an Independent.</p>
      <p>Mr Hammond, who has been MP for Runnymede and Weybridge in Surrey since 1997, said he felt "aggrieved" at the loss of the whip.</p>

      <p>"The Conservative Party that I have served has always had room for a wide range of opinions and has been tolerant of measured dissent," the Remain campaigner said in his resignation letter to constituents.</p>
      <p>"Many parliamentary colleagues have defied the party whip on occasions without any action being taken against them.</p>
      <p>"But however aggrieved I feel at the loss of the whip, and however strongly I believe that we must deliver Brexit through a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU to protect British jobs and prosperity, I remain a Conservative and I cannot, therefore, embark upon a course of action that would represent a direct challenge in a General Election to the party I have supported all my adult life."</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old said he would remain an "active party member" and thanked his constituents for allowing him 22 years of service.</p>
      <p>"It has been a pleasure to serve you and I wish you all every good fortunes for the future. I shall miss you greatly," he said.</p>
