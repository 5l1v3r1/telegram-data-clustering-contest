      <h1>Hero Xpulse 200 Rally Kit announced at EICMA 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:16:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:16</time> by <a rel="author">Vishal Venugopal</a></address>
      <p>The Rally Kit is ready-to-fit but has not been homologated for road use.</p>
      <p>Hero has revealed two new products at EICMA 2019 â€“ the 1.R Concept and this, the Rally Kit for the Xpulse 200. Hero has said that the Rally Kit has been designed to serve as a catapult for young talents across the globe for improving their off-road riding, as well as to participate in rally events. However, the kit is not homologated for use on the road.</p>
      <p>The kit includes fully adjustable, taller suspension at either end, a flatter seat, extended gear lever, handlebar risers, and dirt tyres to improve its off-road prowess. The engine remains unchanged and continues to be the 199.6cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled motor that produces 18.4hp and 17.1Nm of torque. However, the sprockets have been changed to a 12T front and a 40T rear. From the looks of it, the kit appears to be similar to <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/bike-news/2019-hero-xpulse-200-spied-before-launch-411912">the one on the Xpulse that was spied a couple of weeks before its official launch</a></b> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The Rally Kit is a ready-to-fit unit that's compatible with the Xpulse 200. Prices and further details on availability will be known in the near future.</p>
