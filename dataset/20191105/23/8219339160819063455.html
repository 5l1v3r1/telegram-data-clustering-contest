      <h1>PSA: Apple releases critical Xcode 11.2.1 update for developers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:30:36+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/filipeesposito/" target="_blank">Filipe Espósito</a></address>
      <p>Apple has just released an emergency Xcode 11.2.1 update for developers — the tool used to create iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS apps. That comes a week after the official release of Xcode 11.2, which featured SDK support for <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/28/ios-13-2-now-available-emoji-more/">iOS 13.2</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/29/apple-releases-macos-catalina-10-15-1-update-with-new-emoji-homekit-secure-video-support-and-more/">macOS Catalina 10.15.1</a> and other updates released last week.</p>
      <p>According to the company, today’s update fixes a critical issue that could cause apps using UITextView to crash when run on previous versions of iOS, iPadOS, or tvOS. With the latest Xcode update, Storyboards containing a UITextView will no longer cause the app to crash on operating system versions earlier than iOS 13.2 and tvOS 13.2.</p>
      <p>Developers facing this issue should update Xcode now. The new version is only available on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/">Apple Developer</a> website for now, but it should be available on the Mac App Store anytime soon.</p>
