      <h1>Emmerdale fans disgusted over Moira's 'low' excuse for cheating on Cain</h1>
      <h2>Emmerdale's Moira Dingle claimed she was using sex as a form of self-harm, before also revealing her mental health struggles</h2>

      <p>Emmerdale's Moira Dingle likened her fling with Nate Robinson to "self-harming", as she gave husband Cain Dingle her reasons for cheating on him.</p>
      <p>Cain finally allowed Moira to have her say in the latest episode, weeks on from him discovering her fling with his secret son Nate Robinson.</p>
      <p>An emotional Moira begged for another chance, as he refused to hear her out.</p>
      <p>But as she returned to their home during Tuesday's episode of the ITV soap, she told him why she really cheated on him before opening up on her secret struggles.</p>
      <p>Sat down, Moira burst into tears before revealing how she has felt "numb" for a while, also confessing she felt the need to be "punished".</p>

      <p>After the death of her daughter Holly and ex James Barton in 2016, she ended up murdering sister-in-law Emma Barton a year later.</p>
      <p>Her son Adam Barton was forced to flee the village early last year after he took the blame for the murder.</p>
      <p>Since then her and husband Cain had been on and off, with his own torment after believing he'd killed Joe Tate last year sending him off the rails.</p>

      <p>But the pair soon got back on track, until Moira cheated on Cain with Nate - tearing them apart for good.</p>
      <p>After opening up on her losses, Cain refused to allow her to blame Holly's death or Adam's departure on her betrayal.</p>
      <p>It's then that Moira claimed she was punishing herself and "sticking the knife in" before life got the chance, not being deserving of happiness.</p>

      <p>She told Cain that she slept with Nate "because she wanted to", before declaring she could only describe it as "self-harming".</p>
      <p>Moira confessed: "I'm selfish and I’m messed up but for a while it took me somewhere else... is that what you wanted to hear?"</p>
      <p>She added: "The only way I can describe it is like self-harming. I feel like I should be punished and I don’t deserve to be happy.</p>

      <p>"The part of me that does this, she doesn’t care, she knows the hurt she’s causing but does it anyway.</p>
      <p>"I think I did it because it forces me to feel something, because most of the time I just feel numb, like my life is on autopilot and I’m just going through the motions and it's only when I risk it all that I realise how much I love."</p>
      <p>Cain wasn't buying her excuses though, telling her she'd already lost him despite her pleas to let her get counselling and try to work on their marriage.</p>
      <p>Viewers were also having none of it, with some even blasting Moira for comparing her fling to self-harm - while one viewer suggested that Moira wasn't wrong in her claims and even praised the soap for shedding light on the idea that sex is a possible form of self-harm.</p>

      <p>One fan said: "Can't believe Moira just compared cheating with self-harming, that's so bad, how low can u get."</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "Did Moira really use self-harm as an excuse wow that’s low!"</p>
      <p>A disagreeing viewer commented: "Sex can be used as a form of self harm. Quite powerful for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emmerdale?src=hashtag_click">#Emmerdale</a> to point it out."</p>
