      <p>All-Ireland football winners Frank McGlynn of Donegal and Dublin’s Eoghan O’Gara have called time on their inter-county careers.</p>
      <p>McGlynn was part of the Donegal set-up for 14 seasons, during which he won an All-Ireland SFC medal and All-Star in 2012, as well as five Ulster medals.</p>
      <p>As for O’Gara, he pocketed seven Celtic Crosses and 10 Leinster medals from his 11 years in the Dublin camp.</p>
      <p>The 2017 final win over Mayo was the sole All-Ireland decider O’Gara started during his time in blue.</p>
      <p>He was used off the bench in the final wins of 2011 and 2013, while also seeing game-time during the 2016 drawn decider against Mayo.</p>
      <p>He did not feature in Dublin’s two most recent All-Ireland final triumphs.</p>
      <p>O’Gara paid tribute to Dublin legend Anton O’Toole, who died earlier this year, in his parting statement.</p>
      <p>“I have spent 11 years living out my dreams as a kid growing up in this great city,” began the 34-year old.</p>
      <p>“To ‘The Blue Panther’ Anton O’Toole, a man who inspired me and showed me the way to the top via my actions, not my words. A man who embodied all the values a sportsperson and a person should have.</p>
      <p>“To get to follow in his footsteps and then share the field with my club-mates Denis [Bastick] and Niall [Scully] in a blue jersey was an absolute honour and privilege.</p>
      <blockquote>“To every one of my team-mates past and present, there aren’t words to describe my gratitude and love for you.”</blockquote>

      <p>McGlynn’s retirement, meanwhile, reduces to six the number of survivors still involved with Donegal from their 2012 All-Ireland final winning team. They are Paul Durcan, Paddy McGrath, Neil McGee, Leo McLoone, Paddy McBrearty, and Michael Murphy.</p>
      <p>“I have experienced so much during my career and I will be forever grateful for this,” said McGlynn.</p>
      <p>“From great victories to heavy defeats, I have enjoyed every minute of it. I have shared a dressing room with some of the best Donegal players ever.</p>
      <blockquote>“There are memories both on and off the field that I will never forget.”</blockquote>
