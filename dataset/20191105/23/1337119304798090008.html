      <h1>The threats against TikTok are beginning to add up</h1>
      <h2>Regulation, competition, and a tongue-tied chief executive are making life hard at the fast-growing app</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/casey-newton" target="_blank">Casey Newton</a></address>
      <p>For the past 10 years, any regulation of social media companies in the United States has moved at a glacial pace. But when it comes to TikTok, the government is moving with unusual speed.</p>
      <p>It has been less than two weeks since two senators first asked the director of national intelligence to look into whether TikTok, the looping short-form video app owned by Chinese company ByteDance, <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/issues/the-hammer-comes-down-on-tiktok-206601">poses a security risk to the United States</a>. On Friday, the investigation entered phase two: an inquiry into whether ByteDance might be forced divest Musical.ly, an American app that ByteDance acquired in 2017 for $1 billion and helped form the basis for TikTok.</p>
      <p>Greg Roumeliotis, Yingzhi Yang, Echo Wang, and Alexandra Alper <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-cfius-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-opens-national-security-investigation-into-tiktok-sources-idUSKBN1XB4IL">had the exclusive at Reuters</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security risks, has started to review the Musical.ly deal, the sources said. TikTok did not seek clearance from CFIUS when it acquired Musical.ly, they added, which gives the U.S. security panel scope to investigate it now.<br/>CFIUS is in talks with TikTok about measures it could take to avoid divesting the Musical.ly assets it acquired, the sources said. Details of those talks, referred to by CFIUS as mitigation, could not be learned. The specific concerns that CFIUS has could also not be learned.</blockquote>
      <p>(I’m told that a formal inquiry has not been opened, but that CFIUS <i>has</i> begun asking questions.)</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Congress will hold a hearing on privacy, security, and censorship concerns created by Chinese apps. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/03/tiktok-declines-testify-congress-about-china-move-that-threatens-stoke-lawmakers-ire/">Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) invited TikTok, but the company elected not to participate</a>, Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report at the <i>Washington Post. </i>(Apple declined to participate as well, for what it’s worth.)<i> </i>“We appreciate Sen. Hawley’s invitation. Unfortunately, on short notice we were unable to provide a witness who would be able to contribute to a substantive discussion,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20947850/tiktok-bytedance-josh-hawley-china-app-government">the company told my colleague Makena Kelly</a>.</p>
      <p>How serious is this CFIUS investigation? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/3/28/18285274/grindr-national-security-cfius-china-kunlun-military">The Grindr case from earlier this year</a> may offer a useful precedent. The popular gay hookup app had been acquired in 2016 by Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd. Because of its nature, the app obtained some of the most sensitive user data imaginable, from real-time location to nude photos and videos. Some of those users worked in the US government and the military, creating the possibility that the app could reveal troop movements or offer useful material for blackmail. CFIUS ordered Kunlun to sell the app — a sale that appears to still be pending.</p>
      <p>At first blush, data shared in TikTok would appear to be far less sensitive than data shared in Grindr. But as Chinese censorship demands roil more American companies — and given Congressional Republicans’ hair trigger for anything resembling the stifling of conservative speech — it’s easy to imagine the case for divestment that CFIUS could build here.</p>
      <p>And as regulatory pressure on TikTok grows, so too does competitive pressure. Jack Nicas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/technology/tiktok-facebook-youtube.html">rounded up some of the threats over the weekend in the <i>New York Times</i></a>, including some comments from Mark Zuckerberg’s leaked audio that we broke last month. Those threats include: Facebook’s clone, Lasso; a forthcoming Instagram feature called Clips; and an app called Firework that Google considered buying. I’d also add an app called Triller, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8540314/triller-overtaking-tiktok-with-hollywood-investor-13m-monthly-users">which raised $28 million last month</a> and says it already has 13 million users; and <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2019/05/31/alibaba-invest-tiktok-competitor-vmate-app-india/">the Chinese app VMate</a>, which Alibaba sunk $100 million into earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The competitive threat is especially interesting when you consider that TikTok’s user retention — the percentage of users who return to the app every week — still falls short of Facebook or Instagram. The number of new users has declined since ByteDance ratcheted down the amount of money it spent advertising to new users on other social platforms. And the basic idea of an entertainment app powered by machine learning that shows users a bunch of fun videos punctuated by ads may ultimately be easy to clone — which is why you see so much venture capital flooding into rivals at the moment.</p>
      <p>A final growing threat to TikTok is what you might call narrative risk — or, the likelihood that the company won’t be able to overcome shifting public opinion about Chinese-owned apps in America. ByteDance CEO Zhang Yiming rarely gives interviews, and to my knowledge has never spoken on the record to an American journalist about TikTok. Nor has Vanessa Pappas, the company’s well respected US general manager, who joined the company in February after a long career at YouTube. To date, TikTok has been loath to speak up for itself — and it’s hard to win a public-relations battle from the sidelines.</p>
      <p>ByteDance has begun to deploy a phalanx of spokespeople to push back on allegations of censorship and promote a more positive view of the company. Last month, it also announced <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-commitment-to-our-users-and-the-tik-tok-experience?mod=article_inline">it had hired an independent American law firm</a> to review its content moderation practices. It also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/technology/tiktok-national-security-review.html">hired an American firm to audit its security practices</a>, which found that TikTok would have been unable to transmit user data to China during the period it surveyed. And the company is reportedly <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/468884-tiktok-seeks-to-join-tech-fight-against-online-terrorism">making plans to join the industrywide Global Industry Forum to Counter Terrorism</a>,</p>
      <p>Still, it’s not too early to ask whether TikTok can survive outside the arms of its wealthy benefactor. The app grew to prominence in no small part because ByteDance spent more than $1 billion advertising it. TikTok has now been installed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/14/tiktok-hit-9m-in-in-app-purchases-last-month-up-500-over-last-year/">more than 1.2 billion times around the world</a>, and it’s likely that only a giant would be able to afford it, if CFIUS makes ByteDance sell it. But such an acquisition would put TikTok on a collision course with Congress over its other pet issue of the moment: antitrust.</p>
      <p>No matter what happens to TikTok, ByteDance will be fine. The company is valued at $78 billion, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20947721/tiktok-bytedance-smartisan-jianguo-pro-3-release-date-china-price-features">just put out its first smartphone in China</a>. (It comes preloaded with TikTok’s Chinese-language sibling, Douyin.) Maybe ByteDance will go to war to protect its American investment — the most successful American consumer internet product ever created by a Chinese company.</p>
      <p>But as pressure escalates on TikTok, the company may find that it has few levers of support to pull on. Putting its executives forward outside the friendly confines of a press release would be a start. But so long as the Chinese government is looming behind the company’s business practices, TikTok faces a credibility gap — and it’s not clear what, if anything, can close it.</p>

Former <b>Obama</b> campaign manager David Plouffe is advising the effort, with the goal of competing with the president on his own terms. Shane Goldmacher at <i>The New York Times </i>explains how the campaign will work:</p>
      <blockquote>The effort will feature advertisements across multiple digital platforms, including Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Hulu and Pandora. There will be original content, such as videos and animations, as well as boosting local news coverage that portrays Mr. Trump, his administration and his agenda in a harsh light.<br/>Ms. McGowan said that for months her group had been raising the alarm about Mr. Trump’s early online spending advantage.<br/>“It started to feel as though we were really screaming into the abyss,” she said. So they decided to take matters into their own hands.</blockquote>

Kurt Wagner talks to the company’s chief marketing officer at Bloomberg:</p>
      <blockquote>The point is to ensure that people who use those products know they’re owned by Facebook, said Chief Marketing Officer Antonio Lucio.<br/>“All the research that we’ve had from Generation Z and millennials was all very emphatic as to they need to know where their brands come from,” Lucio said in an interview. “We needed to be more transparent with our users in showcasing that everything is coming from the same company.”<br/>Lucio said most people don’t know that Instagram and WhatsApp are Facebook-owned — he cited a Pew research study that found only 29% of Americans knew Facebook owned both apps. When people find out, Lucio said it improves that person’s perception of Facebook as a company.</blockquote>
