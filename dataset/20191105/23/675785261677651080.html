      <h1>Frank Lampard hails Chelsea's spirit after dramatic Ajax comeback</h1>
      <h2>The Blues fought back from 4-1 down against last season's Champions League semi-finalists</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:46:53+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard praised the spirit of his Chelsea heroes after their epic comeback to deny nine-man Ajax.</p>
      <p>The Blues boss, whose team fought back from 4-1 down, said: “Our spirit and character was something that the fans loved. We need to tighten up for sure but with that spirit we can go places.”</p>
      <p>Lampard’s team looked dead and buried against last season’s semi-finalists with just over half an hour remaining.</p>
      <p>But they somehow escaped with a point after a crazy contest which also saw both Ajax centre-backs sent off and two goals disallowed.</p>
      <p>Lampard added: “I don’t think I’ve been involved in a game like that. The two own goals from us were the story of the first half.</p>

      <p>“We were in it at half time. I said to the players we will draw this game at least 3-3 or even 4-4, it could even be 4-3 to us, we could win it.</p>
      <p>“If we get rid of those moments that gave them the crazy goals, some misfortune on our part, we could go places.”</p>
      <p>Tammy Abraham had gifted the Dutch side a second-minute lead when he turned a Quincy Promes cross into his own net.</p>
      <p>Promes then headed home in the 20th minute to put Ajax after Jorginho had equalised from the spot. Hakim Ziyech forced Blues keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga into an own goal from a corner and the Moroccan then teed up Donny van der Beek ten minutes after the break to make it 4-1.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> captain Cesar Azpilicueta, however, appeared offside as he made it 4-2 from close range in the 62nd minute.</p>
      <p>Ajax then imploded with both their centre-backs sent off with just over 20 minutes left.</p>
      <p>First former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> star Daley Blind received a second yellow card for a foul on Abraham.</p>
      <p>Then Joel Veltman saw red for handball. Jorginho pulled it back to 4-3 from the spot before substitute Reece James rammed the ball home through a crowded penalty box for a dramatic equalizer two minutes later.</p>

      <p>Azpilicueta believed he had won the game for his side with an angled drive with just 12 minutes left. But VAR ruled his effort out for handball.</p>
      <p>Lampard went on: "I know we had 4-4s with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and some crazy games, but the red cards and the VAR....I can't give you a dissection of those because I need to look back with a calm head and see them. When you are on the sidelines, it’s very difficult to grasp it straight away."</p>
      <p>With nine men Ajax still attacked, with full-back Noussair Mazraoui forcing a fine save from Arrizabalaga. Substitutes Callum Hudson-Odoi and Michy Batshuayi also blew chances to grab a winner for the home side.</p>
      <p>It leaves Chelsea second in Group H on seven points with Ajax top. Chelsea next travel to Valencia - 4-1 winners over Lille - on November 27.</p>
