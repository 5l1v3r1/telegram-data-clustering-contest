      <p>There may be no better way to celebrate<i> The Voice</i>’s latest Mega Mentor Taylor Swift<b> </b>than by watching <a href="https://www.kellyclarksonshow.com/video/delicate-taylor-swift-cover-by-kelly-clarkson-kellyoke/4061736">Kelly Clarkson’s cover of “Delicate” by Swift</a>. At the top of the Tuesday, Nov. 5 episode of <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show, </i>Clarkson<i> </i>opened the show as she always does: with a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/kelly-clarksons-hocus-pocus-tribute-does-bette-midlers-character-justice-19285849">segment where she sings other artist's songs called "Kellyoke."</a> On this particular episode, she belted out the sixth single off of <i>Reputation </i>in honor of her <i>Voice</i> colleague. <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyClarksonTV/status/1191497856156344322">Swift retweeted the video of the performance</a>, suggesting that she approves of this cover. Granted, it is the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/58470-21-of-kelly-clarksons-best-live-performances-to-tide-you-over-until-piece-by-piece-arrives">one and only Kelly Clarkson</a> nailing one of Swift's most intimate tracks.</p>
      <p>Clarkson's rendition of "Delicate" is not her first time covering a Swift song. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu6aNnv3A7I">She has covered "Blank Space,"</a> "Shake It Off," and other songs during her concerts, and naturally, Swift sure seems to be all about it. Per Elite Daily, after she <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/music/kelly-clarkson-crushes-blank-space-cover-video/1146321">saw one of Clarkson's covers in 2015</a>, the "You Need to Calm Down" singer tweeted, "Kelly Clarkson covered Blank Space and YES." The two shared another special cover moment when Clarkson included a snippet of one of Swift's tunes in the medley of popular singles she <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/bbma/8456910/kelly-clarkson-medley-bbmas">performed at the top of the 2018 Billboard Music Awards</a>. During the "Look What You Made Me Do" segment, the camera cut to <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/kelly-clarksons-2018-billboard-music-awards-song-medley-mashup-got-the-crowd-on-their-feet-rightly-so-9150993">Swift in the crowd as she jokingly rolled her eyes</a>, checked her nails, sang along, and then burst into laughter.</p>
      <p>The Kelly Clarkson Show on YouTube</p>
      <p>Now the two are officially costars on the 17th season of <i>The Voice </i>with Swift acting as a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-is-a-mega-mentor-taylor-swift-is-returning-to-the-voice-for-a-crucial-role-18756923">mentor to all four teams</a> and Clarkson being one of the four main coaches. While both have appeared on <i>The Voice</i> before, this is the first time they have been part of the same roster: <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/38009-taylor-swift-joins-the-voice-as-an-advisor-shell-be-great-because-she-gives-good">Swift was an advisor on Seasons 4 and 7,</a> and before Clarkson became a coach in Season 14, she helped out on Seasons 2 and 13.</p>
      <p>Recently, Swift and Clarkson's names ended up in headlines together when one reached out to the other via social media about music rights. Following the news that <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/taylor-swift-plans-to-re-record-her-masters-after-all-the-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-drama-18689190">Scooter Braun bought the master recordings</a> of Swift’s first six albums in June, Clarkson offered up a supportive piece of advice. On July 13, the original <a href="https://twitter.com/kellyclarkson/status/1150168164853882880?lang=en"><i>American Idol</i> winner suggested to Swift on Twitter</a> that she re-record all of the songs, writing, "I'd buy all the new versions just to prove a point." When Clarkson appeared on <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> in September, she shared that while she does not care about owning her own masters, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRPmVeN19LY">she understands why Swift feels differently</a>. Clarkson explained to Jimmy Fallon, "I write a little more than half of my stuff, but hers is a hundred percent of it, so it's hers, so I can see how it would matter."</p>
