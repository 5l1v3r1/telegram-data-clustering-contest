      <h1>Who are the best English speakers in Europe?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:34:48+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:34</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>The Dutch are the most proficient English speakers in the world, a global study of English skills has found.</p>
      <p>Swedish education company Education First used an online language proficiency test to rank countries where English is not the most spoken language. They tested 2.3 million people across the world.</p>
      <p>In Europe, English proficiency skills are rising, <a href="https://www.ef.se/__/~/media/centralefcom/epi/downloads/full-reports/v9/ef-epi-2019-english.pdf">the study found</a>.</p>
      <p>France improved its position in this year's report, but Spain and Italy fall behind the rest of the EU, the report says, a finding consistent with other reports. Of the Eurozone's four largest economies, only Germany "speaks English well".</p>
      <p>English is widely spoken around the world with the third most native speakers after Chinese and Spanish. Over a billion people speak it as a first or a second language, according to Education First.</p>
      <p>Sweden, Norway and Denmark followed the Netherlands as having the top English skills in the world.</p>
      <p>However, those who took the test were "self-selected" in that they were people interested in learning English or curious about their language skills.</p>
      <p>The entire format was also online and tested reading and listening skills.</p>
