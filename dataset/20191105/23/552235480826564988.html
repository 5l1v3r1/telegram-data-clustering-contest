      <h1>Steve Clarke targeted by Stoke City as Potters make shock 'bid' for Scotland boss</h1>
      <h2>The Championship side are looking for a new manager after sacking Nathan Jones last week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:06:44+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Stoke City have reportedly made a shock 'bid' for Scotland boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> to become their new manager.</p>
      <p>The Championship side are looking for a new gaffer after sacking Nathan Jones last week.</p>
      <p>And according to the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4920551/steve-clarke-stoke-city-target-scotland-job/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1572993048">Scottish Sun</a> , the Potters have made an ambitious move for the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> man.</p>
      <p>The same report claims that Clarke has knocked back their approach.</p>

      <p>The Championship side targeted Preston's Alex Neil at the weekend, but were also unsuccessful with their attempts.</p>
      <p>Clarke took charge of Scotland in May but has suffered a frustrating spell on the Hampden touchline, with only two wins from six games.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> failed to qualify from their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> group, but have a chance to reach the tournament with a play-off tie in March.</p>
      <p>Clarke named his 25-man squad for their two remaining group games against Cyprus and Kazakhstan as they look to build momentum for the crucial game next year.</p>
