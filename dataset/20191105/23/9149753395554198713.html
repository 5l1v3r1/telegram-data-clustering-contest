      <h1>Rockstar Games Launcher update will hopefully fix some Red Dead blues</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:30:46+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/anchalk/" target="_blank">Andy Chalk</a></address>
      <p>Rockstar has rolled out an update to its launcher that, among other things, fixes some crashes that can occur when starting <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-release-date/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, including the Epic Games Store version.</p>
      <p>Here's the full <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/360037932234/Rockstar-Games-Launcher-Release-Notes-v1-0-9-164">changelog</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed an issue that resulted in the Rockstar Games Launcher returning the error "The Rockstar Games Launcher failed to initialize" on startup</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that resulted in the Rockstar Games Launcher preload decryption getting stuck and not completing</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that resulted in the Rockstar Games Launcher returning the error "The Rockstar Games Launcher exited unexpectedly" when launching Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that resulted in crashes when starting the Rockstar Games Launcher from the Epic Games Launcher</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue that resulted in the Rockstar Games Launcher returning the error "Unable to launch game, please verify your game data" when launching Red Dead Redemption 2 from the Epic Games Launcher</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To update the launcher, close any Rockstar games that may be running, and then close the launcher itself by right-clicking the icon in the Windows taskbar and selecting exit. Then restart it (I always like to wait a beat first) and the update should apply automatically.</p>
      <p>Some users <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1191855189390766081">on Twitter</a> are saying that the update has not corrected their issues, but if you're having troubles it's worth a shot. We've also got an ongoing rundown of other possible fixes and workaround that you can keep up with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-bugs-crashes-fixes/">here</a>.</p>
