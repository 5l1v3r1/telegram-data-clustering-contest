      <p>At Logan Airport Terminal E, families of fallen police officers united, not by grief this time, but by the possibility of healing. They are taking part in a free Heroes Cruise of Germany courtesy of Vantage Deluxe World Travel.</p>
      <p>"We are a police family my goal is to never let Jerry's memory go," said Cynthia Hurley.</p>

      <p>Hurley's husband was Boston Police officer Jeremiah Hurley, who was killed in the line of duty in 1991.</p>
      <p>Cynthia is going on the trip to help others.</p>
      <p>"I don't think you can ever put it aside, we are here and hopefully we are going to have a good time," said Hurley.</p>
      <p>Falmouth Police officer Ryan Moore was shot on the job in July 2018. </p>
      <p>"I was shot. But fortunately, I made it out unlike a lot of other officers," said Moore. </p>
      <p>He's retired now but his road to recovery is long.</p>
      <p>"After the incident, you think everybody is evil and you forget there are still good people out there," said Moore. </p>

      <p>This group will spend a week together cruising Germany's Rhine River but it is the process of recovery that really binds them.</p>
      <p>"It's a family and it is something special that we have something in common. And that our loved ones paid the sacrifice. They are all heroes," said Doris Beauregard Shecrallah.</p>
      <p>In a little over a week, these families will return to Boston. It's hoped this experience will strengthen bonds and help these heroes heal.</p>
