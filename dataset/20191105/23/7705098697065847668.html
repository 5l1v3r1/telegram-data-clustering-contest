      <h1>Andy Serkis Might Be The Batman’s Alfred Pennyworth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T23:48:09+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 23:48</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>Every Bruce Wayne needs his Alfred, and it looks like Matt Reeves has just recruited another big name to fill this role in the character’s next film. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/andy-serkis-alfred-pennyworth-batman/">The Wrap</a> brings word that Andy Serkis is currently in talks to play the Dark Knight’s butler in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Serkis is obviously no stranger to superhero movies, having played Ulysses Klaue in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But right now, he’s gearing up to re-enter the comic book fold in a much different capacity. This summer, he was hired to direct <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/venom-2"><b>Venom 2</b></a>, which will hit theaters next year. <b>The Batman</b> will mark Serkis’ third collaboration with Reeves after he played Caesar in <b>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes</b> and <b>War for the Planet of the Apes</b>.</p>

      <p>Much like Batman himself, plenty of actors have brought Alfred to life over the last several decades. Jeremy Irons starred as the latest big-screen iteration of the character in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice"><b>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice</b></a> and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/justice-league"><b>Justice League</b></a>. Irons was preceded by Michael Caine in Christopher Nolan’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-dark-knight"><b>Dark Knight</b> </a>trilogy and Michael Gough in the Burton/Schumacher series. Alfred has also shown up on the small screen as well. There, he’s been played by the likes of Ian Abercrombie (<a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/birds-of-prey"><b>Birds of Prey</b></a>), Sean Pertwee (<a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/gotham"><b>Gotham</b></a>), and Jack Bannon (<a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/pennyworth"><b>Pennyworth</b></a>).</p>
      <p>If everything goes according to plan, Serkis would join a star-studded cast that also includes Robert Pattinson (Bruce Wayne/Batman), Zoe Kravitz (Catwoman), Paul Dano (the Riddler), and Jeffrey Wright (Commissioner Gordon). <b>The Batman</b> flies into theaters on June 25, 2021.</p>
