      <p>BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic had to use a side entrance to access the state television building on Tuesday evening after around 200 angry opposition supporters blocked the main door in a protest over what they said was government control of the media.</p>
      <p>Protesters, shouting “Vucic, thief!”, began gathering around about an hour before a Vucic live interview was due to start on Serbian state broadcaster RTS TV. The protesters accuse Vucic of staging his media appearances and not taking difficult questions, accusations he denies.</p>
      <p>A special police unit stepped in to prevent violence between the opposition protesters and around 100 of Vucic’s supporters.</p>
      <p>Vucic posted a photo on Instagram from inside the RTS studio, saying he had gone in via the side entrance.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank everyone for their support,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Most opposition parties are set to boycott next year’s parliamentary elections over accusations that there is not a level playing field for the campaign. European Union-mediated talks between them and Vucic’s Serbian Progressive party have not yet reached agreement.</p>
      <p>The Alliance for Serbia, a loose grouping of opposition political parties and movements, have been staging weekly rallies for almost a year to protest the rule of Vucic’s Progressive Party of Serbia, which they say is autocratic, corrupt, and stifling media freedoms and democracy.</p>
      <p>Vucic and his party have denied the allegations. </p>
      <p>Serbia has dropped 14 places on the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, ranking 90th of the 180 states.</p>
