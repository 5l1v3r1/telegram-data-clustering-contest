      <p>Hollywood stars focused much of their social media energy Tuesday on Virginia, where all 140 seats in the state Senate and House are up for grabs. Republicans have held onto slim majorities in both houses as Democrats have gained significant ground in the most recent elections.</p>
      <p>“Virginia — you’re just two seats away in the Assembly to gain Democratic control and just one seat in the state senate,” Moore tweeted on Tuesday. “Dems in charge means VA can pass the Equal Rights Amendment for women’s rights! VOTE!”</p>

      <p>Midler encouraged voters to turn out in Virginia, Louisiana, and Mississippi, in order to flip the legislatures in those states toward the Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>“On the eve of Election Day, I send this out to all the good and decent people who want to see a different outcome from the one they’e [sic] been living in,” the actress tweeted.</p>
