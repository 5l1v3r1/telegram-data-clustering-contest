      <p>COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — USA Swimming has named Catherine Kase as open water head coach for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>

      <p>It’s Kase’s third Olympic open water coaching stint. She worked with Tunisia in 2012 and the U.S. in 2016.</p>
      <p>Kase, who previously went by her maiden name Vogt, is an associate head coach of Southern California’s swimming and diving team.</p>
      <p>Her assistant will be named later.</p>
