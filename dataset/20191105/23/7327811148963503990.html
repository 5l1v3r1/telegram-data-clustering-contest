      <p>NEW YORK (WABC) -- Starbucks has opened its first mobile pick-up store in the United States, located near Penn Station in New York City.</p>
      <p>Customers on the go can use the Starbucks app to order and pay.</p>
      <p>The chain, which already has mobile ordering, is taking it to the next level with its pick-up spot.</p>
      <p>At just 400 square feet, there's no real space for chilling over your latte there. Instead, it is like an express espresso.</p>
      <p>You order through the app before you arrive, look for your name on the board, grab your order and leave.</p>
      <p>The baristas work mostly behind the scenes. The store is in the pedestrian alleyway between West 33rd and West 34th Streets.</p>
      <p>There are a number of other full-service Starbucks blocks away, and two right below ground, inside Penn Station.</p>
      <p>"They're a zoo," said one customer. "So the idea to come in, have a coffee waiting for you, pick it up and go, is perfect."</p>
      <p>Expect to see more pick-up spots soon in busy areas. The next one is planned for near Grand Central Terminal.</p>
