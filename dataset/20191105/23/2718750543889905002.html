      <p>Boyfriend <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/video-randall-otiss-asmr-for-white-liberals.html">ASMR</a>, or the type of video where a cute boy looks directly at the camera and talks feather-soft through a role-play scenario so it feels like audio Xanax, is having <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/style/asmr-boyfriend-sleep-videos.html">something of a moment</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelFails/status/1191387356181520384">Lanky bois</a>, the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/nicholas-braun-succession-cousin-greg-encounter.html">Cousin Gregs</a> and <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zach-woods-in-the-woods">Zach Woods</a> of the world, are also (meekly, awkwardly, humbly) a bit of a thing right now. What perfect timing, then, for the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/joe-pera-talks-with-you-returns-for-second-season.html">season-two</a> trailer for <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/mike-obrien-joe-pera-talks-with-you-interview.html"><i>Joe Pera Talks With You</i></a> to drop. By any definition, Joe Pera is the gangly-sweet clown prince of Boyfriend ASMR, and his warmly funny, charming Adult Swim series features him talking to not just anyone, but to <i>you, </i>the viewer, about such mercifully low-stakes scenarios as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5x5CB7wjygs">going for breakfast</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSUilYKcRMA">falling back asleep</a>. In this trailer, Pera talks to you from a beauty parlor, where he gets to use his <a href="https://vimeo.com/170977560">famous beauty-parlor line</a> on the be-curlered elderly ladies. Such a nice young man! Watch this trailer and you’ll be as tickled as Nana, Carol, Lulu, Jane, Donna, Rho, and Louise, whose best friend is wine. <i>Joe Pera Talks With You’</i>s new season premieres December 6 on Adult Swim. Until then, there’s always the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91wX0NRjJqg">ten-hour YouTube loop</a> of his very festive animated special.</p>
