      <p>Pitso Mosimane had some emotional words to say about Benni McCarthy’s departure from Cape Town City.</p>
      <p>The Citizens shockingly announced at midnight on Sunday that they’ve terminated the contract of McCarthy, with Vasili Manousakis taking over the helm of the team in the interim.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The timing of their announcement took the entire football fraternity by surprise, with many revealing their disappointment, especially Pitso Mosimane.</p>
      <p>“I am very, very saddened by the Benni McCarthy sacking. I was his biggest fan, admiring how he taught his team to play the right way of playing football,” Mosimane said on his official Twitter account.</p>
      <p>“His team could build up play from the back like what big teams do in Europe (Man City, Bayern, Liverpool etc.)</p>
      <p>“A typical example of his work was the goal that Cape Town City scored against Kaizer Chiefs. A coaching clip for coaches and those who believe in good football. </p>
      <p>“(He is) a big loss to SA football (and) I hope he remains in the Premier Soccer League to transfer his philosophy to another team. </p>
      <p>“Some players went to play for Cape Town City just to play for him. (He is) a very good coach (and) I salute you Benni. You can walk away with pride especially after delivering a trophy in just a year and half,” Mosimane concluded. </p>
