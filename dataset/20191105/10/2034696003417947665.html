      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart">The Pains of Being Pure at Heart</a> have announced they’re breaking up via a statement from frontman Kip Berman.</p>

      <p>The group, who were founded by Berman in 2007, consisted of singer and keyboardist Peggy Wang, bassist Alex Naidus and drummer Kurt Feldman. They released their self-titled debut in 2009 together with three further full-length albums, 2011’s ‘Belong’, 2014’s ‘Days of Abandon’ and 2017’s, ‘The Echo of Pleasure.’</p>
      <p>In a statement released yesterday (November 4) via Instagram, Berman said: “My life has changed radically from the time I started Pains with Peggy, Alex and (soon after) Kurt in 2007, and I’ve decided to focus on a new project <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_natvral/">@the_natvral</a>.</p>
      <p>“Pains was a distinct moment in my life. I started the group when I first moved to New York and completed our last record, ‘The Echo of Pleasure,’ shortly before my daughter was born and I moved to Princeton, NJ. From that time forward, I never really felt the same – and the music I was creating didn’t feel the same either. But this is good, both for my heart and my music.”</p>

      <p>He continued: “I know some of you equate ‘PAINS’ with a particular lineup of people, but I’ve always felt that whoever I collaborated with has been ‘the real band,’ because what animated the music was so consistent.</p>
      <p>“But now, that strange something that inspired what we were able to create is absent. What has taken its place feels very different, and I have to express it in a different way.”</p>
      <p>In October 2018, Berman released his first EP as the Natvral, ‘Know Me More’ and has confirmed that he’s in the process of making a new record.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “I’ve spent this past year making a new record, and hope to share it sometime next year.” He also shared a new cover of a song he’s been working on recently, ‘You Looked Like a Portrait’ which you can listen to here:</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5de0xMNSVBycBsvUf6GJvG?si=as7vpiYLQU66QL07tHqH-A">You Looked Like a Portrait<br/></a>We and our partners use cookies to personalize your experience, to show you ads based on your interests, and for measurement and analytics purposes.

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-the-pains-of-being-pure-at-heart-10138#Rkl1EL6mkj5R44Ju.99">Writing about the band’s debut album in a four star review, NME said</a>: “This time last year it was as if someone had been leaving copies of ‘Graceland’ in every thrift-store in Brooklyn. Now it seems like someone has come across a job lot of NME’s legendary ‘C86’ tape of fey indie bands, because they’re all at it – Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts and now this lot.</p>
      <p>“Everything from the oh-so-twee name to singer Kip Berman’s affected English accent screams wrong, but it sounds so right; a bit of Mary Chain here, a withering Moz-esque turn of phrase there and a lot of early, jangly My Bloody Valentine everywhere else. But it’s much more than the sum of its parts and too effortlessly effervescent to be studied. Pure indie-pop to hold close to your heart.”</p>
