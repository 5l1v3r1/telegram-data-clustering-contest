      <h3>A soldier was killed when he was hit by a landmine allegedly planted by suspected members of New People’s Army (NPA) while on his way back to their patrol base on Sunday in Lopez, Quezon.</h3>
      <p>The victim was identified as Private Kim A. Veluz, 23, native of San Francisco, Quezon and member of  85th Infantry Battalion of Philippine Army.</p>
      <p>According to Col. Norwyn Romeo P. Tolentino, commander of the 201st Infantry Brigade , the incident occurred on Sunday at Barangay Sta. Rosa, Lopez, Quezon.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, Private Veluz was wearing civilian clothes and was on his way to his Temporary Patrol Base when the attack was launched by the terrorists belonging to Milisyang Bayan.</p>
      <p>During the attack the victim hit the landmine planted by the terrorist and exploded hitting him directly.</p>
      <p>The military condemned the act of the rebels adding that it is in violation of the “Mine Ban Treaty” which was signed and ratified by 156 states, including the Philippines, in 1997 at Ottawa, Canada.</p>
      <p>“it is unfortunate that a human being has to die in a manner that is internationally considered as inhumane yet continuously being utilized by a rag tag band of terrorists desperate for our people’s attention and relevancy in the community,” Tolentino said.</p>
