      <p>ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turks’ support for President Tayyip Erdogan surged last month, when Ankara launched a military incursion in northeastern Syria to clear the Kurdish YPG militia from near its border, a survey by Metropoll showed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Erdogan’s approval rating rose by 3.7 percentage points in October to 48%, the survey showed, its highest level since shortly after presidential elections in June of 2018, which were held before last year’s currency crisis took hold.</p>
      <p>His disapproval rate fell 9.3 percentage points to 33.7%, its lowest level since a failed coup in July 2016. Some 18% of participants did not respond to the survey question or said they had no idea.</p>
      <p>Since the worst of the crisis, which knocked 30% off the value of the lira last year, Erdogan’s support had eroded as inflation and unemployment surged and the economy dipped into a recession.</p>
      <p>Ankara, as well as most Turks, see the YPG as a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in Turkey. The PKK has waged a separatist insurgency against the state since 1984 and some 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.</p>
      <p>Four of the five political parties in the Turkish parliament have strongly supported Turkey’s operation against the YPG. The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) opposed it and said it was aimed at boosting dwindling support for Erdogan and his AK Party.</p>
      <p>Ankara launched its operation on Oct. 9, days after President Donald Trump abruptly decided to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria following a phone call with Erdogan. The attacks were met with international condemnation.</p>
      <p>Turkey later reached separate agreements with Washington and Moscow and stopped its operation after YPG militants withdrew from a border strip inside Syria.</p>
