      <p>Dramatic CCTV footage has shown the moment a rail worker pulled a passenger from the tracks one second before a train was about to hit him.</p>
      <p>John O’Connor, a supervisor on San Francisco’s Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), was helping manage crowds at the Coliseum station in Oakland when a man fell on to the tracks.</p>
      <p>Mr O’Connor’s remarkably quick reaction meant he managed to pull the passenger back on to the platform just as a train pulled into the station.</p>
      <p>Colleagues have since described the rail worker as a hero, but he said he was just doing his job.</p>
      <p>“John is a transportation supervisor and has worked at BART for more than 20 years. An amazing rescue,” the rail operator said.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr O’Connor said the CCTV footage appeared much slower than it actually felt.</p>
      <p>“I was fortunate that God put me there and he got to see another day. When I spoke to him later, I told him, ‘Hey, pay it forward’,” Mr O’Connor was quoted by CBS SF as saying.</p>

      <p>Fellow passenger Tony Badilla filmed Mr O’Connor hugging the rescued man as those on the platform applauded.</p>
      <p>“I was watching John work as I was waiting for the train before this happened,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Badilla added: “He demonstrates passion in his work and we all should extend our gratitude to those we encounter who do the same on a daily basis.”</p>
