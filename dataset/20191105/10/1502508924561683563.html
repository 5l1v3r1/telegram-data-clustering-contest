      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:07:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Nussey | Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>Group Corp and its founder Masayoshi Son face a day of reckoning on Wednesday when the investment juggernaut is likely to post weak quarterly results, hit by hefty falls in the valuation of some of its biggest tech bets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>has come under renewed investor scrutiny after it was forced to bail out one of its best known portfolio <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>- the cash-burning, office-sharing firm <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>- for $10 billion (£7.8 billion).</p>
      <p>That has deepened concern about Son's strategy of pouring billions of dollars into unproven, money-losing startups at a time it is getting squeezed by a sell-off in most of its listed bets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uber-technologies">Uber Technologies </a>Inc posted on Monday a wide quarterly loss, sending its shares sliding in after-hours trading. SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund has a $7.7 billion investment in the U.S. ride-hailing firm.</p>
      <p>SoftBank's quarterly results come at a crucial time for Son, when he is trying to raise capital for a successor to the Saudi Arabia-backed Vision Fund.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/softbank">SoftBank </a>is expected to post an operating loss of 48 billion yen (£342 million) for the July-September quarter on Wednesday, according to the average forecast of four analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>That would be its first quarterly loss in 14 years, Refinitiv data shows, and compares with an operating profit of 706 billion yen a year earlier.</p>
      <p>SoftBank has delivered multiple quarters of sector-beating gains driven by internal revaluations of tech bets by the Vision Fund, which had its first major close in May 2017.</p>
      <p>Analysts estimates vary widely, in part because SoftBank provides little detail on how it accounts for those gains or losses on its books.</p>
      <p>A further lack of disclosure over valuations on Wednesday would "risk losing the trust of investors," said Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors.</p>
      <p>Given its falling share price - down around 30% since July - the conglomerate may unveil a share buyback of around 500 billion yen to try and stem the slide, Anvarzadeh said. SoftBank announced a 600 billion yen buyback in February.</p>
      <p>
        <b>UNUSUAL STEP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Investors will be looking closely at how SoftBank accounts for the value of its stake in WeWork, into which it has poured $13 billion to take a majority stake. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>was valued by SoftBank as high as $47 billion as recently as January, but is currently valued at just $8 billion.</p>
      <p>The Japanese company is expected to announce on Wednesday a writedown of at least $5 billion due to a slump in values of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/wework">WeWork </a>and some other top holdings, Bloomberg reported late last month.</p>
      <p>SoftBank has taken the unusual step of structuring the bailout to avoid having to consolidate WeWork on its books, despite taking an 80% stake, reducing its disclosure requirements as it tries to avoid liability for the startup's onerous lease obligations.</p>
      <p>Dan Baker, analyst at Morningstar, said he is marking the value of WeWork at zero until SoftBank's restructuring has demonstrated a clear path to profitability.</p>
      <p>SoftBank said last week it will post a $2.6 billion gain on the value of its stake in Son's most acclaimed tech bet, Alibaba Group Holding .</p>
      <p>With the Vision Fund facing headwinds, sellside analysts are emphasising the value of other parts of SoftBank's portfolio, including telcos SoftBank Corp, which on Tuesday reported a 9% rise in second quarter profit, and Sprint .</p>
      <p>Sprint has been struggling to close its $26 billion merger with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/t-mobile">T-Mobile </a>due to legal hurdles, in a deal which if successful will remove the telco's debt from SoftBank's highly leveraged balance sheet.</p>
      <p>SoftBank also owns chip designer Arm, for which Son paid a large premium in a $32 billion deal in 2016, banking the company, which is dominant in the mobile sector, could repeat its success in nascent sectors where it lacks critical mass.</p>
      <p>Arm, which under SoftBank ownership has become money losing, plans to return to the public markets by 2023.</p>
