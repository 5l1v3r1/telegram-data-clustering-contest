      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:47:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Top Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg today issued a grovelling apology after making "disgraceful" and "insensitive" comments about the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>
      <p>The Leader of the Commons had been condemned by victims' families after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jacob-rees-mogg-urged-apologise-20812090">saying the “common sense” reaction</a> would be ignore 'Stay Put' advice and flee a fire.</p>
      <p>In comments reported by the Evening Standard, Mr Rees Mogg said: “I profoundly apologise.</p>
      <p>“What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade’s advice to stay and wait at the time. However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn’t and I don’t think anyone else would.</p>
      <p>“What’s so sad is that the advice given overrides common sense because everybody would want to leave a burning building.</p>

      <p>“I would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments. With hindsight and after reading the report no one would follow that advice. That’s the great tragedy.”</p>
