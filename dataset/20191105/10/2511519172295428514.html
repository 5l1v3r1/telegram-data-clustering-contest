      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AngelinaJolie">Angelina Jolie</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/richard-madden">Richard Madden</a> were among the cast members evacuated from the set of Marvel film <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-eternals"><i>The Eternals</i></a> after a bomb was found, according to reports. </p>
      <p>The cast and crew of the movie were taken to safety in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, after the unexploded device was found and bomb disposal experts were called to the scene.</p>
      <p>A source from the set told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10278659/richard-madden-angelina-jolie-bomb-scare/"><i>The Sun</i></a>: “It was obviously terrifying – the bomb could have been there for decades untouched but who knows what might have happened if it was disturbed.”</p>
      <p>It is not yet known where the bomb originated or how it came to be in Fuerteventura. However the island was previously used as a German military base during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>The forthcoming film, which also stars Kit Harington, centres around a race of immortal beings who lived on Earth and shaped its history and civilisations.</p>
      <p><i>The Eternals</i> will be released in UK cinemas on 6 November 2020.</p>
