      <h2>One of the key features of the new Act is intercepted telephonic conversations would now be considered as a legitimate evidence</h2>

      <p>President <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ram-nath-kovind">Ram Nath Kovind </a>has given his assent to 'the Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime (GCTOC) Bill', a controversial anti-terror legislation passed by the BJP-ruled state in March 2015.</p>
      <p>One of the key features of the new Act is intercepted telephonic conversations would now be considered as a legitimate evidence.</p>
      <p>The announcement on the Presidential assent was made by Gujarat Minister of State for Home, Pradeepsinh Jadeja, in Gandhinagar on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The bill, earlier named as the Gujarat Control of Organised Crime (GUJCOC) Bill, had failed to get the presidential nod thrice since 2004 when Prime Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/narendra-modi">Narendra Modi </a>was the chief minister of the state.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/gujarat-government">Gujarat government </a>re-introduced the bill by renaming it as the GCTOC but retained the controversial provisions like empowering the police to tap telephonic conversations and submit them in court as evidence.</p>
      <p>Jadeja said the provisions of the bill will prove crucial in dealing with terrorism and organised crimes such as contract killing, ponzi schemes, narcotics trade and extortion rackets.</p>
      <p>"The dream of PM Modi was finally fulfilled today," he said.</p>
      <p>"One of the key features of this bill is that the intercepted telephonic conversations would now be considered as a legitimate evidence. This bill also provides for creation of a special court as well as appointment of special public prosecutors. We can now attach properties acquired through organised crimes. We can also cancel transfer of properties..," said Jadeja.</p>
      <p>Other provisions of the act is admissibility of confession made before a police officer as evidence.</p>
