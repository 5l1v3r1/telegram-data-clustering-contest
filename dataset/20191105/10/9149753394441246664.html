      <h1>The first Red Dead Redemption 2 mod turns Arthur into the Joker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:44:52+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-release-date/">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> is finally launching on PC today, but ahead of that launch you can already download the first Red Dead Redemption 2 mod. With it, Arthur can cosplay as another wanted criminal: Batman's old pal, the Joker. </p>
      <p>The mod changes Arthur's default face so that he's smeared with paint and ready to clown around. Red Dead Redemption 2 can get a bit dour, but this will surely cheer everyone up. You can download it on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/6">Nexus Mods</a>.</p>
      <p>The team behind the mod, RedDeadModders, hasn't provided installation instructions because the game isn't out yet—it's a mystery. It's not clear how RedDeadModders managed to get access to the game, but hopefully this means Rockstar gave more modders an opportunity to play around with it.</p>
      <p>The team's also working on a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4X3KWZBzJi/">Terminator</a> mod, an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4NiPJFhebR/">undead horse</a> and plenty of guns. Check out the lot of them <a href="https://www.reddeadmodders.com/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>As I was writing this, another mod also popped up. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption2/mods/4">RDR2 Photorealistic Reshade</a> is a reshade mod that enhances the game's colours, shadows, tone mapping and sharpness. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we'll have to wait a few more hours to find out if they're any good, but at least we'll have a few things to test out straight away when Red Dead Redemption 2 launches later today. </p>
