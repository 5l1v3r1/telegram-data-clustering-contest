      <h1>2 arrested over murder of Indonesian activist journalists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:55:22+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Two men have been arrested in connection with the <a href="https://coconuts.co/jakarta/news/2-activist-journalists-mediating-land-dispute-involving-palm-oil-company-stabbed-to-death-in-indonesia/">brutal murder of a pair of Indonesian activist journalists</a> who were mediating in a land dispute between a palm oil company and locals, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Maraden Sianipar’s body was found last week in a ditch near a palm plantation in Labuhan Batu, an eight-hour drive from the capital of North Sumatra province.</p>
      <p>Police found the remains of his colleague, Maratua Siregar, in the same area a day later.</p>
      <p>Both had been stabbed multiple times.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday police said they had arrested two suspects and were seeking four more, adding they could face the death penalty if charged and found guilty of murder.</p>
      <p>“The motive was revenge and was linked to the palm plantation land dispute,” local chief detective Jama Kita Purba told AFP.</p>
      <p>“We are still investigating the details,” he added.</p>
      <p>Sianipar and Maratua worked together for a local online news portal before going freelance in 2017.</p>
      <p>A friend of Siregar said the victims had recently become known for their activism in land disputes — a common source of conflict across the resource-rich Southeast Asian archipelago.</p>
      <p>The friend said Siregar was active in an organisation that advocated for residents in the land dispute.</p>
      <p>Indonesian journalist associations condemned the deaths and demanded authorities investigate thoroughly.</p>
      <p>Many cases of violence against journalists in Indonesia go unsolved, according to the Independent Journalists Alliance, which has reported at least two dozen cases this year alone.</p>
      <p>Indonesia is ranked 124th out of 180 countries on the 2019 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.</p>
