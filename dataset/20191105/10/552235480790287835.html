      <h1>Fine after dog bites woman, Perth Sheriff Court hears</h1>
      <h2>Animal subsequently put down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:45:39+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author">Perthshire Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/perthshire-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A woman suffered at least eight deep puncture wounds after a Staffordshire bull terrier sank its teeth into her knee while she was out for an early morning run.</p>
      <p>The animal was subsequently put down by its owner, 34-year-old Debbie Bennett, of Myrtle Park, Blairgowrie.</p>
      <p>But she was ordered to pay victim Alison Lee £600 in compensation when she appeared for sentence at Perth Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>The accused was also given a community payback order, with 18 months’ supervision, after she admitted the animal was “dangerously out of control” in Rie-Achan Road, Pitlochry, on February 23 this year.</p>
      <p>She also pled guilty to failing to comply with a September 4, 2014, dog control notice requiring the dog to be muzzled when it was outside.</p>
