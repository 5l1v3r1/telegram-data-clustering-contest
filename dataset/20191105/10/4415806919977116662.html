      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has called on Jacob Rees-Mogg to apologise for suggesting Grenfell victims should have used “common sense” and ignored fire service guidance not to leave the burning tower block.</p>
      <p>Speaking on LBC about the public inquiry report into the blaze, Mr Rees-Mogg discussed London Fire Brigade’s “stay-put” policy, which the report said cost lives.</p>
      <p>The UK Commons leader said on Monday: “If you just ignore what you’re told and leave you are so much safer.</p>
      <p>“I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building.</p>
      <p>“It just seems the common sense thing to do, and it is such a tragedy that that didn’t happen.”</p>
      <p>The UK Labour leader said Mr Rees-Mogg should apologise for the “crass and insensitive comments immediately”.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: “What possesses someone to react to an entirely avoidable tragedy like Grenfell by saying the victims lacked common sense?</p>

      <p>“People were terrified, many died trying to escape.”</p>
      <p>His sentiments were echoed by shadow housing minister, Sarah Jones.</p>
      <p>She said: “These are appalling comments.</p>
      <p>“Jacob Rees-Mogg should retract them and apologise immediately.</p>
      <p>“Statements like this just go to show how out of touch the Tories are and are a glaring admission of their failure to act in the interest of the Grenfell victims and their families.”</p>
