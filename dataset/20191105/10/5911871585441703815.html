    <meta property="og:description" content="Lana Del Rey's Norman Fucking Rockwell! tour rolled through Denver, CO last night at the Bellco Theatre and Del Rey had a couple special guests on-hand. Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard played a solo set before Del Rey's show, and then she brought him out during her set so that they could cover &quot;I Will Follow You Into The Dark&quot; together, the enduring hit from the band's 2005 album Plans. Australian musician Julia Jacklin — who put out an excellent new album, Crushing, earlier this year — was also there, and Del Rey brought her out to duet on Jacklin's own song &quot;Don't Know How To Keep Loving You.&quot; Watch videos of both performances below. @LanaDelRey and Ben Gibbard @BellcoTheatre tonight in Denver ❤️ pic.twitter.com/iERkwIDp6g— Caroline Danielson (@CarolinemarieD) November 5, 2019 Denver we’ve arrived xBen Gibbard from Death Cab is doing a set before us so make sure to see that x Julia Jacklin is singing a couple of her tunes as well pic.twitter.com/1icsoGDKEB— Lana Del"/>
