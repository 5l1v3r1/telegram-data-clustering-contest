      <p>After making the initial tackle that resulted in Andre Gomes breaking his ankle, Tottenham Hotspur star Heung-min Son has been accused of going over the top with his reaction to the Everton midfielder's nasty injury.</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old South Korean clipped the former FC Barcelona man before the latter landed awkwardly and crashed into right-back Serge Aurier, suffering a dislocated fracture on his right ankle.</p>
      <p>It was not until Son walked over to Gomes to apologise for the tackle that he realised the <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/heung-min-son-devastated-after-andre-gomes-ankle-break/666665">extent of his opponent's injury</a>, and reacted by throwing his hands over his head with a look of shock on his face. The attacker then burst into tears, before being consoled by those around him.</p>
      <p>However, former Premier League striker Stan Collymore believes Son, who was sent off in the aftermath of the challenge, overreacted because of the repercussions he was about to face.</p>

      <p>"I am not saying (Son and Aurier) shouldn't have been upset or shown distress, because these are normal human emotions," he wrote in a column for the <i>Daily Mirror</i>.</p>
      <p>"The way Son reacted made it look like he thought football — the referee, the authorities, fans at home and in the crowd, opponents – was going to come down on him like a ton of bricks, even though we could all see he didn't deliberately go out to cause Gomes' injury.</p>
      <p>"For a while now, I have been bothered that players and managers seem to think they must show an extreme version of their emotions because of the comeback they will get if they do not.</p>
      <p>"Nowadays, footballers seemingly have to go over the top to present themselves before the court of public opinion and that needs to stop."</p>

      <p>Everton have since confirmed that Gomes' surgery on Monday was successful, although it remains to be seen how long he will be out for.</p>
