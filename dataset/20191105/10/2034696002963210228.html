        <b>Tired of hearing about the President? Netflix can help</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> is introducing a button so you can skip all the <a href="http://nme.com/tag/Donald-Trump">Donald Trump</a> jokes in the new Seth Meyers comedy special.</p>
      <p>New show <i>Lobby Baby, </i>which launches today (November 5) sees the comedian take aim at the President, who he has repeatedly criticised in the past.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/04/media/seth-meyers-skip-politics-button-netflix/index.html"><i>CNN Business</i></a>, Meyers said that it was his idea to introduce a button that allows you to skip mentions of Trump in the show.</p>
      <p>The comedian calls it “a funny and innovative way” to “take advantage of the Netflix experience”.</p>

      <p>He continued: “It was a way to build in the response to anyone who would say, ‘Oh, let me guess, there’s going to be jokes about the president’.”</p>
      <p>Meyers describes the feature as a “joke”, saying: “I think, look, sometimes at a fancy restaurant they’ll put parsley on your plate and you’ll think, well, that’s a nice touch, but you’re not going to eat the parsley.”</p>
      <p>The late-night TV host has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/oct/31/seth-meyers-donald-trump-stephen-colbert-samantha-bee-trevor-noah">publicly criticising the President</a> again recently, saying: “Every minute with Donald Trump feels like a horror movie.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/carly-simon-meeting-donald-trump-2563996">Carly Simon also recently reflected on the time she met Donald Trump</a>, saying he was “all over me like ugly on an ape”.</p>
