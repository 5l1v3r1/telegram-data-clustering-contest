        <b>A new survey suggests that Swedes are no longer the world's best non-native English-speakers. But is that cause for concern?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ef.se/epi/">English Proficiency Index (EPI)</a> by global language training company Education First (EF) ranked Sweden second out of 100 countries of non-native English-speakers.</p>
      <p>The country <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20181031/swedes-regain-title-of-worlds-best-non-native-english-speakers">lost last year's lead</a> to one of its main rivals for top spot, the Netherlands, while fellow Nordic nations Norway and Denmark, followed by Singapore, completed the top five.</p>
      <p>Sweden has never been ranked outside the top five in the nine years the survey has been published, and was number one in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2018.</p>
      <p>But if you look at the total score – 68.74 this year – it is Sweden's worst performance in more than five years.</p>
      <p>In fact, the country saw the second-largest decline out of all European countries with its score falling 1.98 points compared to last year. Luxembourg, in ninth place, had the largest drop, declining by 2.30 points.</p>
      <p>Malin Ankarberg, EF's Sweden director, said that perhaps the result indicated that Swedes were becoming somewhat complacent about their level of English, which has been at a high level for years.</p>
      <p>But she also said one year of a slightly worse score than normal was not a major concern.</p>
      <p>"What we're seeing is a small step back, but perhaps it is needed to make the public aware of the fact that we can do better," Ankarberg told Swedish news agency TT.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Swedish women outperformed men, with a score of 69.44 compared to the male 67.45.</p>
      <p>The EPI report is based on a comparison of English skills measured by testing 2.3 million people in 100 countries, ranking their proficiency from "very high" to "very low".</p>
      <p>Fourteen countries were placed in the "very high" category: The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Singapore, South Africa, Finland, Austria, Luxembourg, Germany, Poland, Portugal, Belgium and Croatia. The average European score was 56.71.</p>
