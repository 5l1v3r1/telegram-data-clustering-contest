      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T10:33:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith says Jack Grealish is fit and ready to join up with the England squad if he is called up by Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <p>The Three Lions host Montenegro in a Euro 2020 qualifier on November 14 before travelling to Kosovo three days later.</p>
      <p>Grealish has been touted for the next England squad following his excellent displays for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> in recent weeks, the captain netting his first goals of the season for the club last month.</p>
      <p>He was instrumental in the 2-1 defeat of Brighton and Hove Albion on October 19, scoring the equaliser before setting up Matt Targett's last-gasp winner.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old was also on the scoresheet in the 5-1 rout at Norwich at the start of last month.</p>
      <p>However, he has been out since he injured his calf in the final few minutes of the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-17191487">missed the 2-1 defeat to Liverpool last time out</a> , but should he be included when the England squad is announced for the Euro qualifiers Smith says he will pass him fit to join up with the national team.</p>
      <p>"He's available for (England) selection that's for sure," Smith said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After the Liverpool game, Smith addressed the fitness of his talisman for the visit of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> on Sunday (2pm).</p>
      <p>He missed the Carabao Cup clash between the two sides at Villa Park last month, watching his side record a 2-1 win over their West Midlands rivals to set up a quarter-final tie with Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"I said to him I need you 100 per cent, we're playing against one of the top teams in the world," <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/basics-everything-dean-smith-said-17191467">Smith said</a> .</p>
      <p>"We need players who are 100 per cent and he held his hand up.</p>
      <p>"He'll be good for next week against Wolves."</p>
