        <b>At least five members of a family in northern Mexico, including two infants, were killed on Monday in an attack by unknown gunmen, a government source and local media said, in the latest case of grisly violence to hit the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mexican media reported that the victims belonged to the LeBaron family, associated with a break-away Mormon community that settled in northern Mexico decades ago, and that the dead as well as additional missing family members may all be US citizens.</p>
      <p>The governments of Chihuahua and Sonora states, both of which border the United States, issued a brief, joint statement late on Monday saying an investigation into the incident had been launched and that some people were presumed dead and others missing.</p>
      <p>The statement, which noted that additional federal and local security forces were being sent into the area near the border between the two Mexican states, did not provide further details.</p>
      <p>Local television showed images of a burnt out vehicle that may have belonged to the family, and local activist and family member Julian LeBaron was quoted as describing the incident as a "massacre," adding that some family members were burnt alive.</p>
      <p>The press office of the US embassy in Mexico did not immediately respond to request for more information after hours.</p>
      <p>The US Ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, travelled to Sonora earlier on Monday for work meetings, he posted on Twitter.</p>
