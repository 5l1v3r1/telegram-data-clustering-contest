      <p>Demand for new cars in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> fell 6.7 percent last month, the automotive industry said.</p>
      <p>Some 10,348 fewer cars were registered in October than during the same month in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).</p>
      <p>The figure reflects a tough environment for businesses and consumers as economic and political uncertainty continue to hit confidence, the trade association said.</p>
      <p>The decline was driven by a 13.2 percent drop in demand from private consumers.</p>
      <p>Sales of diesel models were down 28.3 percent, while petrol cars fell by 3.2 percent.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, fuelled cars such as hybrids and battery electrics took a market share of 9.9 percent, which is the highest on record.</p>
      <p>Year-to-date figures shows that the new car market declined 2.9 percent during the first 10 months of the year compared with 2018.</p>
      <p>SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said: "The growth in alternatively fuelled cars is very welcome, showing increasing buyer appetite for these new technologies.</p>
      <p>"The overall market remains tough, however, with October now the year's eighth month of decline.</p>
      <p>"Whether the General Election delivers a bounce to the economy remains to be seen, but with attractive deals and an ever-greater choice of low, ultra-low and zero-emission models arriving in the UK's showrooms, consumers have every incentive to consider buying a new car."</p>
      <p>Alex Buttle, director of car selling comparison website Motorway.co.uk, said: "The UK car industry will surely look back at 2019 as one of its gloomiest on record.</p>
      <p>"It's unlikely new car sales are going to pick up materially before the end of the year, with consumers also now having a General Election to get their heads around.</p>
      <p>"All the market can hope for is that the perceived disaster of a no-deal [<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/events/brexit.html">Brexit</a>] has been averted."</p>
