      <p>Celtic midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/olivier-ntcham">Olivier Ntcham</a> could switch allegiance from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/france-football-team">France</a> to Cameroon after being placed on standby for their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against Cape Verde and Rwanda.</p>
      <p>The Parkhead star has been capped by France at all youth levels and has won 18 caps for the French Under-21s team and even played for them in this summer's European Under 21s Championship Finals where they reached the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>But he's set to play for the Indomitable Lions now and is on the waiting list for their double-header next week in Yaounde against Cape Verde and then in Kigali where they will face Rwanda.</p>
      <p>Cameroon boss Toni Conceicao has been attempting to persuade the midfielder, whose parents are both from the African nation, to play for his side and ditch the World Champions.</p>

      <p>Last year after signing a new deal with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a>, Ntcham admitted he had a decision to make regarding his international future.</p>
      <p>He said: "Cameroon have been in contact with me but, to make a good decision, you have to take your time. They are happy for me to do that.</p>
      <p>"Even if they weren’t, it’s me who is going to decide what happens. They haven’t given me a time for when they want me to decide. In life you have to take your time when you make a decision like this. Is it a decision from the heart or the head? Both.</p>
      <p>"My parents are both from Cameroon but they haven’t said anything to me about it. It is my decision. My friends and family all have an opinion on the situation but I don’t want to say what it is."</p>
      <p>Ntcham has made 17 appearances for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a>'s side this season, scoring three goals.</p>
