      <p>Residents in Strathaven have been left sickened after cattle skulls were dumped next to a bin.</p>
      <p>The extreme fly-tipping saw two skulls ditched along with household waste just outside the town.</p>
      <p>Doreen Dodds made the gruesome discovery near Caldermill and spoke with the News about the issue.</p>
      <p>She said: “These are definitely not fake.</p>
      <p>“They looked like the heads of bulls, with big thick horns. They looked rotten.</p>
      <p>“But there they were, in amongst household rubbish and all. I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s pretty scary.”</p>
      <p>A volunteer with Cat Concern and Cat Action, Doreen says there is a larger problem with animal abuse in the South Lanarkshire area.</p>

      <p>She added: “I saw a grouse just dumped recently and a cat at the side of the road.</p>
      <p>“Then there was the four starved puppies cruelly dumped at the side of a road in Dungavel.</p>
      <p>“There’s a real problem here.”</p>
      <p>Reacting to Doreen’s post on Facebook, Peter Kinnon wrote: “What an absolute disgrace this is, and fly-tipping in general.</p>
      <p>“Our local MP and SLC need to look at this urgently, and initiate the appropriate actions and penalties against all those involved.”</p>
      <p>Claire Shearer added: “Shocking, disgusting – also shows that the bins are not emptied enough.”</p>
      <p>And Carol Brogan gave credence to some of Doreen’s concerns about a bigger issue.</p>
      <p>She wrote online: “That is really shocking.</p>
      <p>“I was out running last week in Strathaven and ran past a bin bag full of game birds at the side of the road on the stretch of road from Sandford to Strathaven.”</p>
      <p>Doreen – who works at the Royal Infirmary Hospital – reported the matter to the SSPCA who said they were looking into the matter.</p>
      <p>Scottish SPCA inspector Dawn Robertson told us: ‘We have been made aware of this incident and are investigating.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with any information is urged to contact our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”</p>
