        <i>A station employee saved a passenger who had fallen on to the tracks just before a train was about to hit him. John O’Connor was making sure passengers stayed away from the yellow safety strip when the man accidentally fell on to the tracks as the southbound train was approaching the Coliseum station in Oakland, California, on Sunday. Speaking after the incident, O’Connor said he would ‘like to think anybody else standing there would have done the same thing’</i>
