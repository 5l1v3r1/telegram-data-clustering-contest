      <p>Although there are a few markets tucked away throughout the city, Prague has two main Christmas markets. The good news? They're just a five-minute walk from each other.</p>
      <p>The first is on <b>Wenceslas Square</b> (a pretty fitting name if you ask us!), the second is on the <b>Old Town Square</b>.</p>

      <p>Both markets offer up heaps of stalls where you'll find everything from delicious foodie treats to arts and crafts, clothes and Christmas decorations.</p>
      <p>There are also plenty of fun events including carol singing around the Christmas trees, dance performances and even some fun workshops for kids.</p>
      <p>The markets tend to be open from around 10am to 10pm, although the food stalls close at midnight.</p>
      <p>If you've got a while longer in Prague and want to check out more markets, you can also find festive offerings at <b>Republic Square</b> or in front of the <b>St George's Basilica</b> at Prague Castle (there may be an entrance fee for the latter).</p>
