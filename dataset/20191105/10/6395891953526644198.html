      <p><b>CLEVELANDÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say a man suspected in a shooting that left three people dead in Cleveland has pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five-year-old Kielonte Harris pleaded not guilty Monday to one count. His bond was set at $1.5 million. Court records don't show an attorney who could speak for him.</p>
      <p>Authorities say they found 36-year-old April Magana's body inside a home and 31-year-old Joseph Meeks III dead in an alley Saturday.</p>
      <p>An injured Muriel Tursivio was found in a nearby vacant lot and died at a hospital.</p>
      <p>Police say all three had been attending a party and were shot in the head after a verbal altercation.</p>
      <p>A prosecutor said at Monday's hearing that he expects additional charges to be filed against Harris.</p>
