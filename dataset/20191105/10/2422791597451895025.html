      <p>MILAN -- The Prada fashion group has signed what is billed as the first business loan in the luxury goods sector linking the annual interest rate to practices that help the environment.</p>
      <p>Prada said Tuesday that the five-year, 50 million-euro ($55-million) loan with Credit Agricole Group will see interest rates lowered based on "achievement of ambitious targets related to sustainability."</p>
      <p>The targets include the number of stores that meet defined standards for "green" buildings, education workshops for employees and the use of regenerated nylon in collections.</p>
      <p>The fashion world, recognized as the second most polluting industry after oil, has been working in recent years to adopt more environment-friendly practices. Prada's efforts include a project, called Prada Re-Nylon, to use recycled nylon made from plastic recovered from oceans in its trademark nylon bags.</p>
