      <p>BENGALURU (Nov 5): Southeast Asian stock markets closed higher on Tuesday, with Philippines rising the most, as risk appetite was boosted by a report that the United States was planning to drop some tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>
      <p>Global equities rose after the Financial Times reported that the United States was considering rolling back levies on US$112 billion of Chinese imports as a concession to a partial deal, which could be signed this month, according to US officials.</p>
      <p>"If the US does roll back existing tariffs, the positive spillover will extend beyond financial markets, as such a move would alleviate the downwards pressures on global trade conditions as well," said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM in a note.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the central bank of China cut interest rates on its medium-term lending facility loans to support economic growth and tackle any fallout from the country's trade dispute with the United States.</p>
      <p>The Philippine bourse closed at its highest level in more than three months, rising for a second consecutive session. A bulk of the bourse's gains came from last minute buying into heavyweight stocks.</p>
      <p>The country's annual rate of inflation eased for a fifth straight month in October and was within the central bank's target for the month.</p>
      <p>Financials and consumer firms lifted the index, with Bank of the Philippine Islands and SM Investments Corp rising 2.8% and 6.4%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Indonesian shares snapped their three-day streak of losses, rising the most in over three weeks as financial and consumer sectors rose.</p>
      <p>Bank Mandiri (Persero) and poultry feed producer Charoen Pokphand Indonesia were up 4.7% and 6.6%, respectively.</p>
      <p>The country's economy grew at its weakest pace in over two years in the third quarter, signalling the possibility of further stimulus measures.</p>
      <p>An index of the country's 45 most liquid stocks ended 2.4% higher.</p>
      <p>Singapore's benchmark index closed at its highest in over three months, rising on the back of consumer and industrial firms.</p>
      <p>Industrial conglomerate Jardine Strategic Holdings added 2.2%, while auto manufacturer Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage rose 1.8%.</p>
      <p>Malaysia's benchmark index ended slightly higher after the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Tuesday, as forecast by a Reuters poll.</p>
      <p>Thai stocks closed at their two-week high, ahead of a Bank of Thailand policy meeting on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The central bank is expected to stand pat on its benchmark interest rate, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
