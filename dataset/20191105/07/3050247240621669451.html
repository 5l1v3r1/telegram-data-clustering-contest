      <h1>Bitcoin Ban Means India Will Get More Corrupt Under Modi — Tim Draper</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:56:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:56</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/india">India</a> is leaving itself vulnerable to corruption by attempting to ban <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a> such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), says <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tim-draper">Tim Draper</a>. </p>
      <p>Speaking to California-based media outlet <a href="https://indicanews.com/2019/10/31/use-tech-back-bitcoin-to-clean-up-indias-economy-vc-tim-draper-tells-modi/">Indica</a> on Oct. 31, the pro-Bitcoin VC investor called on prime minister Narendra Modi to rethink the current hostile environment towards crypto. </p>
      <h3>Draper to Modi: don’t “go back to old ways”</h3>
      <p>India banned banks servicing industry businesses in 2018, with government think tanks now recommending a full crackdown on ownership and use. A court battle to decide the final outcome saw its latest <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/supreme-court-of-india-postpones-cryptocurrency-ban-hearing-to-november">delay</a> last month. </p>
      <p>“I am hoping Modi becomes the honest politician, but when he shut down Bitcoin I thought he is going back to the old ways,” Draper said. </p>
      <h3>“Creating more corruption”</h3>
      <p>It remains uncertain how the Indian state would implement a crypto ban should one come into law. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-prints-new-1000-rupee-note-3-months-after-banning-it">reported</a>, the country’s disastrous 2016 currency reform, which saw the value of some paper notes disappear in holders’ pockets overnight, added to the demand for Bitcoin investment. </p>
      <p>Proponents argue cryptocurrency aids criminal activity such as money laundering, whereas reducing or even eradicating cash allows for a more transparent economy. </p>
      <p>Draper likewise praised the concept of currency reform but added that outlawing Bitcoin leaves the door open for more, not less, corruption. </p>
      <p>“I thought it was a good move; he is getting rid of corruption and trying to create a corruption-free state, but by blocking Bitcoin, he is creating more corruption and I think that is very dangerous for the country,” he added.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/pathetic-and-corrupt-tim-draper-slams-proposed-bitcoin-ban-in-india">noted</a>, Draper previously gained mixed reviews when he delivered considerably more vocal comments about India’s stance on crypto. </p>
      <p>In July, he described the Indian government as “pathetic and corrupt.”</p>
      <p>Delhi meanwhile remains keen on blockchain, with defence minister Rajnath Singh on Monday describing it as having <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-and-ai-have-revolutionized-war-india-defence-minister">transformed</a> the face of warfare.</p>
