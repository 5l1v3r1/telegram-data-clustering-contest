      <h1>Illinois State Lottery Winner Puts Half His $500,000 Into Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:28:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:28</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>An Illinois resident who won $500,000 in a state lottery has revealed he put half of it into Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) back in May. Redditor “Joxnlol,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/drm3de/did_this_then_put_half_into_btc_in_may_remind_me/">posted</a> an image of himself clutching the Illinois state lottery cheque on Nov. 5, with the caption: “Did this. Then put half into BTC in May. Remind me in 8 months if I f****d up.”  </p>
      <h3>65% gain to date</h3>
      <p>Joxnlol’s winning ticket sealed him the $500,000 bounty on April 19: given he converted half of it in early May, his investment has so far seen close to a 65% gain, as Coin360 data shows:</p>

      </p>
      <p>In a subsequent post, Joxnlol indicated that he plans to HODl the investment for a minimum of one year, revealing:</p>
      <blockquote>“I don't intend to touch any of it for at least another year. I set aside money for emergencies, I set aside money for myself, and I set aside money for tattoos. The only major purchases I've done is [...] bought a new car for myself and put a downpayment on a house.”</blockquote>
      <p>Notably, Joxnlol’s $500,000 was reduced to roughly $357,000 after taxes, he revealed — meaning he would have invested $178,500 in BTC.</p>
      <p>Thread contributors were virtually unanimous on two points: that if Joxnlol had f****d up in any way, it was by not having invested 100% in BTC, and second, that he was tempting fate by publicizing his face and winnings on the net, making him a potential target for criminals.</p>
      <p>Joxnlol also indicated he was storing his Bitcoin on trading app Robinhood, arguing that for him, personally, the risk of losing a cold-storage wallet outweighed the security risks of trusting his coins to a centralized third-party.</p>
      <p>Crypto community member @BashCo, who <a href="https://twitter.com/BashCo_/status/1191447980848615425?s=20">tweeted</a> a link to Joxnlol’s thread, remarked that:</p>
      <blockquote>“The popularity of this tweet makes me question if average people still falsely associate Bitcoin with lottery. Bitcoin is sound money. But if I tweet that, it will only get 20 likes.”</blockquote>
      <p>By press time@BashCo’s tweet has garnered 630 likes and Joxnlol’s original Reddit thread has 2,700 upvotes.</p>

      <p>Bitcoin’s current market cap of approximately $167.8 billion represents around 73% of state and local lottery revenue between 2008-2017, which totaled $228.8 billion, according to Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/249128/us-state-and-local-lottery-revenue/">data</a>. </p>
      <p>A new <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/number-of-americans-owning-crypto-doubled-in-2019-finder">survey</a> of United States residents estimated that 36.5 million of them now own some form of cryptocurrency — representing a twofold increase, from 7.95% in 2018 to 14.4% in 2019.</p>
