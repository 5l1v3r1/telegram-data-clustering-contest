      <p>BENGALURU (Nov 5): Asian stocks saw a rise in valuations in October as equities surged on signs that Washington and Beijing were nearing a truce in their 16-month-long trade war amid upbeat third-quarter earnings by heavyweights.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-pacific shares rose more than 4% in October, pushing its 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio to a 20-month high of 13.6 times by October-end. The ratio stood at 13.1 at the end of September.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump announced a "Phase 1" trade agreement on Oct 11, and has said he hoped to sign the deal with China's President Xi Jinping in November at a summit in Chile.</p>
      <p>A better-than-expected earnings performance for Asian firms also boosted the regional shares last month. Asian companies topped the average earnings estimates by about 5.5% in the third quarter, as per Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Due to the rise in the P/Es, regional shares are catching up with the valuations of their global peers, Refinitiv data showed.</p>
      <p>India and Malaysia were the most expensive in the region, with ratios of 17.22 and 15.95, respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China, Hong Kong and South Korea were the lowest-cost shares in the region, with P/E multiples of about 9.55, 11.17 and 11.3, respectively.</p>
      <p>In October, Japan, Taiwan and Singapore shares rose 5.4%, 4.9% and 3.5%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Losses in the region were led by Thailand and New Zealand, which dropped 2.2% and 1.3% respectively.</p>
