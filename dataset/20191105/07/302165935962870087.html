      <p>PONTIAN, Nov 5 — Claims that some fishermen in Tanjung Piai are to be paid compassionate payment of RM1,000 as promised previously will be looked into, said Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry Minister Datuk Seri Salahuddin Ayub.</p>
      <p>He said this is because it involves financial resources or allocations from the federal or state government.</p>
      <p>“I will obtain more information on this matter from the mentri besar... we’ll discuss first and try to settle it soon,” the Pulai member of parliament told reporters after a walkabout at the Serkat market near here, today.</p>
      <p>Salahuddin said if the claim is true, the financial aid would certainly be distributed based on the list of eligible recipients determined by the fishermen’s association involved.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Salahuddin mingled with residents of Serkat, a town which is increasingly becoming a centre of attraction ahead of the Tanjung Piai by-election scheduled for November 16. — Bernama</p>
