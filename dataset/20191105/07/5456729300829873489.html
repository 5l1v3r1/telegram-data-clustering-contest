      <h1>Nigeria yet to settle N150 billion judgement debt - AGF - Premium Times Nigeria</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:09:25+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/361059-nigeria-yet-to-settle-n150-billion-judgement-debt-agf.html" target="_blank">Adejumo kabir</a></address>
      <p>Abubakar Malami, the Attorney General of the Federation, has said Nigeria is owing over N150 billion in judgement debt.</p>
      <p>Mr Malami disclosed this while speaking on Channels Television Newsnight on Monday.</p>
      <p>Judgement debt is a damage or other monetary award pronounced upon by a court of competent jurisdiction. According to the law, there are two parties in the enforcement of a judgment.</p>
      <p>The judgment creditor (any person/group/government for the time being entitled to enforce a judgment) and the judgement debtor (a person/group/government liable under a judgment).</p>
      <p>Speaking on Monday, Mr Malami said: “there exists over N150 billion judgment debt against the interest of the federal government, as at 2015, when this government came into being”.</p>
      <p>He added that, “Our national assets all over the globe are experiencing one threat or the other, targeted at enforcing these judgments.”</p>
      <p>According to the minister, some judgement debts are obtained through “compromise, fraud and corrupt practices” and as such “the Federal Government has the responsibility of striking a balance between genuine judgments (and) fraudulent judgements.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on the P&amp;ID gas deal, which included the award of a $9.6 billion judgment debt, Mr Malami argued that it was “illegal”.</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari, according to the AGF, has ordered “an investigation, directing agencies of government, including to look into the circumstances that led to the (P&amp;ID) award.”</p>
      <p>Mr Malami said the report has shown that “the tribunal was misled into making an award because of the inherent falsehood in the witness deposition.”</p>
      <p>“Arising from the conduct of investigations, we have, as a nation this time around, decided to initiate an action seeking to nullify the contract, having been obtained and executed in material breaches.</p>
      <p>“The principal characters in P&amp;ID Nigeria admitted to wrongdoings and they were charged to court, pleaded guilty and were convicted. Arising from that conviction there was an incidental order winding off P&amp;ID Nigeria and forfeiture of their assets. We are also taking steps to give effect to these orders,” Mr Malami said.</p>
