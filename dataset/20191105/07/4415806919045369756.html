      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:43:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Online CAO applications open at midday today for students looking to attend third level next year.</p>
      <p>From now until January 20, students can set-up their accounts at a reduced cost.</p>
      <p>The applications process will then close on February 1, but students can still make changes to their course choices up to July.</p>
      <p>Mullingar guidance counsellor Betty McLaughlin says it is a simple process, so it is worth setting up early.</p>
      <p>She explained: "What you do is simply go onto www.cao.ie and click the button that says apply."</p>
      <p>"There you will be asked to enter your personal details. You will then generate an account for yourself.</p>
      <p>"You will pay the fee. You put in a password, then make sure it's a password you will remember carefully.</p>
      <p>"You can log back in at any time then to put in your courses."</p>
