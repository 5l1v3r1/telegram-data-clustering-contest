      <p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A Utah man who served as a local leader for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has pleaded guilty to illegally taking photos of a woman inside a dressing room at a popular Tennessee mall.</p>
      <p>News outlets report 55-year-old Steven Murdock was convicted of unlawful photography Monday and sentenced to a year of supervised probation. A judge also ordered him to undergo counseling.</p>
      <p>A Nashville Metro police affidavit from August states a woman accused Murdock of leading her into a changing room at the Opry Mills shopping mall where she undressed and noticed a phone pointing into her stall. She says she confronted Murdock as he was deleting photos of her.</p>
      <p>A church spokesman previously said Murdock was removed from his volunteer position as a high councilor for Salt Lake City congregations.</p>
