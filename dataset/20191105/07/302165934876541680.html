      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 5 ― US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said today that very good progress was being made towards completing a phase one trade agreement with China and he was hopeful that it would be a precursor to a much more robust agreement.</p>
      <p>A phase one US-China trade deal is under discussion and may be signed later this month.</p>
      <p>“We're hopeful that phase one will be the precursor of a much more robust set of agreements,” Ross said during a call with reporters during a visit to Thailand for regional meetings.</p>
      <p>He said the phase one agreement would reduce tensions and build trust between the United States and China and would also increase global trade confidence.</p>
      <p>“If we resolve phase one, that will calm people down a lot because they'll see an end point is hopefully within sight,” he said. ― Reuters</p>
