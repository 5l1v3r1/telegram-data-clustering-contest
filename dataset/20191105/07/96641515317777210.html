      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>Monday started the week with some key announcements from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/adobemax2019/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">Adobe</a> and Microsoft that will affect how we work across all kinds of devices. Also, researchers have uncovered an unsettling method that could allow an attacker to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/lasers-voice-commands-smart-speaker/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">exploit your voice-controlled smart speaker without making a sound</a>, and we took a spin in the $150k Polestar 1 hybrid coupe.</p>

      <p>If you must have Microsoft's software to get work done on the go, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte/">the Surface Pro X is a solid choice</a>. But the entire Windows on Snapdragon platform is plagued by limited app compatibility and bugs. Plus, adding the Slim Pen stylus and keyboard -- you won't want to use Windows on a tablet without it -- bumps its $999 price to $1,270.</p>

      <p>While a $155,000 vehicle that's only one of 1,500 ever built seems like an odd commuter, it can do the job and probably handle most of that drive in electric mode. The downside is that while its plexiglass-framed wiring looks cool, a triple-battery setup severely cuts into the available trunk space.<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/05/polestar-1-first-drive/"> This grand tourer is a halo car that works better as a concept</a>, and with good reason -- only 450 are coming to the US. Even for big EV fans, it probably makes sense to wait a little longer for the $60k Polestar 2.</p>

      <p>Instead of grabbing separate apps for Word, Excel and Powerpoint (aka the Office Triforce), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-office-app-mobile-word-excel-powerpoint/">Microsoft's new Office app puts them all together</a>. The Office app also makes better use of your phone's talents, with the ability to take a photo of a document and turn it into an editable Word file on the fly or even do the same with printed-out tables in Excel. It's <a href="https://aka.ms/OfficePreviewforAndroid">available for public testing on Android</a>, while an iOS test group is already full.</p>

      <p>To get around the small sensor, narrow lens and shallow depth of smartphone cameras, companies have had to get creative. The biggest advances all come from ways to stack or combine multiple images in the phone using specialized software. Computational photography is using algorithms and even machine learning to stitch together multiple photos to yield better results than were previously possible -- <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/04/upscaled-computational-photography-pixel-deep-fusion-explainer/">here's how it works</a>.</p>
