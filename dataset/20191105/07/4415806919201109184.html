      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T07:08:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 07:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A book of condolence will open for Gay Byrne in Dublin's Mansion House this morning.</p>
      <p>The legendary broadcaster <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/we-will-never-see-his-like-again-tributes-paid-as-gay-byrne-dies-aged-85-961747.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">passed away at the age of 85</a> following a long illness.</p>
      <p>The public will be given the chance to pay their respects from 11am to 5pm and tomorrow between 10am and 5pm.</p>
      <p>President Michael D Higgins led the tributes describing Mr Byrne as a man of great charisma, who was possessed of effortless wit, charm, and who had a flair for broadcasting.</p>
      <p>Colleagues, journalists and entertainers from home and abroad shared their thoughts on a media legend.</p>
      <p>Mr Byrne's <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/if-youre-not-getting-in-trouble-youre-not-doing-your-job-right-tubridy-and-kenny-recall-a-legend-and-icon-961829.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">successors on the Late Late Show have reflected on their relationships with the broadcasting icon</a>, and recalled the advice he dispensed to them throughout their career.</p>
      <p>Pat Kenny, who took over from Mr Byrne as Late Late Show host in 1999, said he visited him a day before he died “when it was quite apparent that there weren't too many days or hours left”.</p>
      <p>“But a few weeks ago myself and Harry Crosbie had lunch with him. He was in great form, and had his usual whiskey and enjoyed lunch, a great appetite.</p>
      <p>"So I had hoped that he would overcome the current bout of illness, but alas, it wasn't to be,” Mr Kenny told RTÉ Radio 1’s Drivetime.</p>
      <p>Current host, Ryan Tubridy, said on social media that the nation "lost an icon and I lost a friend. He was a once-off and everyone will miss the inimitable Gay Byrne."</p>
