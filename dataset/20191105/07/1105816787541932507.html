      <p><b>NEW DELHI: </b>India’s Commonwealth Games weightlifting gold medal winner Ravi Kumar Katulu has been banned for four years after failing a drug test, a top anti-doping official told AFP on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Kumar, who won the 69kg title at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and a silver in 2014 (77kg), tested positive for Ostarine, media reports said.</p>

      <p>Ostarine helps increase muscle mass though is not available to the public.</p>
      <p>“Ravi Kumar has been suspended for four years,” National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) director general Navin Agarwal told AFP without naming the substance involved.</p>

      <p>Ostarine is a “selective androgen receptor modulator”, or SARM, which doping experts say has been increasingly used as an alternative to steroids. No country has yet allowed its use as a medicine but it is widely available on the black market.</p>
      <p>The ban is a new blow for scandal-tainted Indian weightlifting, which has been restricted to only four Olympic places — two men and two women — in Tokyo next year because of its high number of doping cases.</p>
