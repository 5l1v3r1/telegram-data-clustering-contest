      <p>UNIONDALE, Long Island (WABC) -- The Long Island Music Hall of Fame is still looking for a building to permanently set up shop, but in the meantime, organizers are getting creative and improvising.</p>
      <p>A tiny Winnebago parked outside Nassau Coliseum gives a much larger sense of Long Island's musical history and made its debut on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Long Island Music Hall of Fame has a long list of inductees beyond Piano Man Billy Joel.</p>
      <p>"We have Gershwin from here, Barbra Streisand, the Ramones -- you have the Stray Cats, you could go into classical, you could go into jazz, you could go into hip hop -- Kurtis Blow," said Kelly Leung with the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.</p>
      <p>The inductees - who are also from Brooklyn and Queens - include Harry Chapin, whose Congressional Medal of Honor is on display.</p>
      <p>Even though the museum is a walk through music's past, the mobile museum is staying current, and also interactive, with a selfie booth.</p>
      <p>Those attending Tuesday night's Dead and Company concert at the Coliseum took a peek and found some random Long Island relics from the past.</p>
      <p>No matter your taste, chances are you'll find something that interests you in the Winnebago.</p>
      <p>The mobile museum's next stop is The Space at Westbury.</p>
