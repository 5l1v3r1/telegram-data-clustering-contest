        <i>The acclaimed, award-winning novelist was known for his stories of the African American experience in the south</i>
      </p>
      <p>The novelist Ernest J Gaines, whose poor childhood in a small Louisiana plantation town germinated the stories of black struggles that grew into universal stories of grace and beauty, has died. He was 86.</p>
      <p>The Louisiana governor’s office on Tuesday released word of his death.</p>
      <p>“It is with a heavy heart that we say goodbye to Ernest J Gaines, a native Louisianan who used his immense vision and literary talents to tell the stories of African Americans in the south,” <a href="https://twitter.com/LouisianaGov/status/1191812818674302977">a tweet</a> from the office of John Bel Edwards read.</p>
      <p>A Lesson Before Dying, his eighth novel, was published in 1993 to great acclaim. It was loosely based on the story of Willie Francis, a black man sentenced to death by the electric chair twice. It won the National Book Critics Circle Award for fiction and that year, Gaines was awarded a genius grant by the MacArthur Foundation, receiving $335,000 to spend over the next five years.</p>
      <p>He was also awarded the National Medal in Arts in 2012</p>
      <p>“Aside from the fact that he was so immensely talented, he was a good person,” his wife, Dianne Gaines, said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A Lesson Before Dying was also adapted into an Emmy-winning TV movie starring Don Cheadle. Two of his other books, The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman and A Gathering of Old Men, also became films.</p>
      <p>“A towering man with a gentle voice, Dr Gaines was an inspiration to generations and his death will be felt deeply by family, friends, and his university family,” read a statement from the Ernest J Gaines Center.</p>
