      <p>A woman who scooped £2.1m alongside her husband still likes to pinch the pennies despite her jackpot win.</p>
      <p>Back in 2012 Marie Kibler and her husband Paul got lucky on the lottery and their life changed forever.</p>
      <p>They were able to immediately pay off their £50,000 mortgage, purchase a Mercedes each and his and hers Rolex watches, reports <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/meet-millionaire-lottery-winner-who-17205364">BirminghamLive.</a></p>
      <p>Yet while they continue to enjoy some of the finer things in life one thing will never change for Marie and that is her love for bargain shop Poundland.</p>
      <p>Marie, 72, said: "I have always loved Poundland and I always will. I sometimes pop in there two or three times a week. I may have won the lottery but one thing will never change and that is my love for a bargain.</p>

      <p>"I will go in there and I will stock up on toiletries, batteries and cleaning materials. Before I won the lottery I would still be careful about how much I spent in there but now I can buy it in bulk, whole job lots.</p>
      <p>"That's the difference but I will always shop in Poundland.</p>
      <p>"I am down to earth and I will always be down to earth. I don't think we will ever lose that. When you have been careful with your money it is difficult to go and be reckless.</p>

      <p>"The money we won, £2.1 million, sounds a lot of money and it is. However, we have both given up our jobs and have no income coming in so we can't go out and be totally reckless."</p>
      <p>Paul, 59, who ran a gardening business, even worked for a further four years after the win to keep active before deciding to call it a day.</p>
      <p>The couple regularly give to charity and carry out voluntary work.</p>
      <p>Marie added: "The proudest thing I have done with the money is to buy my grandson’s school a defibrillator."</p>
      <p>Paul added: "It is a special school and we were over the moon to give them that."</p>
      <p>The couple also raise money for Cancer Research as their daughter suffered from ovarian cancer and Paul volunteers his services looking after Lichfield War Memorial.</p>
      <p>The couple spoke on the 20th floor of a penthouse suite at the Rotunda in Birmingham city centre as part of the National Lottery's 25th anniversary celebrations.</p>

      <p>Birmingham was chosen as the National Lottery's location to celebrate the milestone because of West Midlands' B postcode has proved to be the luckiest in the UK.</p>
      <p>Since the National Lottery began back in 1994 an incredible 168 millionaires have been made - equivalent to one every two months.</p>
      <p>And in total 1,277 top tier prizes of at least £50,000 have been banked by lucky players in the B postcode.</p>
