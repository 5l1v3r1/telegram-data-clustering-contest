      <p>A dog which fell through ice into a frozen lake had a lucky escape after being saved by rescuers.</p>
      <p>In a video posted on Facebook, rescuers from the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service in Canada can be seen boating out into the middle of the lake through a layer of ice before taking the dog back to land.</p>

      <p>As the dog bounded on to the snowy ground, one rescuer could be heard saying: “Wow, he’s doing great!”</p>
      <p>The City of Winnipeg wrote: “Dog owners are reminded to keep their dogs on leash around frozen waterways to prevent them from chasing geese onto the ice – ice surfaces are thin and fragile, and falling into ice-cold water can be deadly.”</p>
