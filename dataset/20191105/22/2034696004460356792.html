      <p>“It is truly unbelievable to us the happiness we have experienced over the past two days,” the post began. “From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for the warm welcome back. We truly did not expect this. See you soon. Xoxo, MCR.”</p>
      <p>UK fans, meanwhile, eagerly await news on My Chemical Romance’s return to these shores.</p>
      <p>In the years since their split, MCR band members Gerard Way, Ray Toro, Mikey Way and Frank Iero have all enjoyed success with solo and side projects.</p>
