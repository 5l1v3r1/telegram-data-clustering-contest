      <h1>'Whistleblower' must testify under oath and in person: Rep. Jim Jordan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:56:56+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/opinion/" target="_blank">Jim Jordan, Opinion contributor</a></address>
      <p>There are 435 members of the House of Representatives. Only one knows the “whistleblower’s” identity: Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff.</p>
      <p>Democrats are trying to impeach President Donald Trump less than a year before the election based on claims from this anonymous individual who has no firsthand knowledge of the president’s phone call with Ukraine’s president, but who admitted <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-biden-worked-with-whistleblower-when-he-was-vice-president-officials-reveal">a political bias and reportedly worked with Joe Biden</a>, a 2020 presidential candidate.</p>
      <p>Six weeks ago, Schiff said the “whistleblower” would testify. He has now changed his mind. What happened in the interim? Just two things: We learned the individual <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2019/10/schiff-wrong-on-whistleblower-contact/">met with Schiff’s staff</a>. And we learned about their political bias.</p>
      <p>The “whistleblower” only knew about the call from the characterizations of others. He waited 18 days before filing a complaint with the inspector general. During those 18 days, the “whistleblower” met with Schiff’s staff but <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-whistleblower-did-not-disclose-contact-with-schiffs-committee-to-intel-inspector-general-sources-say">failed to disclose this communication to the inspector general</a>. Schiff also hid this meeting.</p>
      <p>Americans understand fairness. They know when someone is getting a raw deal. The Democrats’ impeachment push, based on this anonymous and secondhand complaint, is fundamentally unfair.</p>
      <p>
        <b>OUR VIEW: </b>
        <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/11/04/dont-reveal-whistleblower-donald-trump-phone-call-ukraine-editorials-debates/4157167002/">Don't reveal the whistleblower</a>
      </p>
      <p>Despite Schiff’s biased process, four fundamental facts have not changed:</p>
      <p>►President Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed there was no quid pro quo and no pressure.</p>
      <p>►The transcript of the call shows no conditionality.</p>
      <p>►At the time of the call, <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/zelenskiy-says-didnt-know-us-was-withholding-military-aid-ahead-of-trump-call/30209432.html">Ukraine did not know security aid was delayed</a>.</p>
      <p>►Ukraine never took any of the actions it was supposedly under pressure to take.</p>
      <p>Government whistleblowers should be protected. But a fundamental tenet of due process is the ability to confront one’s accusers. On a matter as grave as impeachment, Americans should assess for themselves the credibility and motivations of the individual who initiated the inquiry.</p>
      <p>That is why the “whistleblower” must testify under oath and in person.</p>
