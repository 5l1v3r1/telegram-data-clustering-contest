      <p>A runaway Brexit rollercoaster featuring a frantic-looking Boris Johnson has been paraded through the streets as part of Bonfire Night festivities.</p>
      <p>The giant sculpture depicting the Prime Minister and Jacob Rees-Mogg was carried through Lewes as the town celebrated November 5.</p>
      <p>The East Sussex town is famous for burning effigies of controversial politicians and celebrities every year on Bonfire Night.</p>

      <p>They are paraded along the narrow streets of Lewes before being burned in front of thousands of onlookers.</p>
      <p>This year marks the second in a row that Boris Johnson has featured among the effigies created by the fireworks societies that take part in the festivities.</p>
      <p>Last year he was depicted holding an axe and Theresa May’s severed head. The piece was later set on fire to the delight of the chanting crowds.</p>
      <p>This year’s rollercoaster creation is complete with broken rails and signpost pointing separately to “deal”, “no-deal” and “ditch”.</p>
      <p>Leader of the House of Commons Mr Rees-Mogg is shown lounging on his roller coaster car – likely a tongue-in-cheek tribute to his demeanour during an emergency Brexit debate in September.</p>
