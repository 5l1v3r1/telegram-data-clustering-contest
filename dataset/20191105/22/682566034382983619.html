      <p>Milan - <b>Pep Guardiola</b> said his side were expecting a tough clash against <b>Atalanta </b>at the San Siro on Wednesday as<b> Manchester City </b>look to wrap up qualification for the <b>Champions League</b> knockout rounds with two games to spare.</p>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions thrashed Atalanta 5-1 at home last month to make it three wins from three in Group C.</p>
      <p>"Although it may seem the opposite given the result, we saw in Manchester that Atalanta is a very good team," Guardiola told reporters Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The last time we met the match was very even in the first half.</p>
      <p>"Before the first fixture there might have been a danger, but they know now what to expect, they have experienced exactly what it takes to come up against them."</p>
      <p>City top their group with maximum points while Atalanta have lost all their three games in their Champions League debut.</p>
      <p>A win would also be a boost before next weekend's top-of-the-table clash with Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"It's a great week for us because we come to Italy and face Atalanta and then face Liverpool on Sunday," said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>"But after that there's still three quarters of the season to play."</p>
      <p>"I want to qualify as soon as possible. Try to win tomorrow to be already there, one more year that would be incredible.</p>
      <p>"But if not, there is Shakhtar at home and Dinamo Zagreb away and we will see."</p>
      <p>Atalanta will again be without influential striker Duvan Zapata, but coach Gian Piero Gasperini still believes they can get a result.</p>
      <p>"For us it represents an opportunity for us to stay in the competition," said Gasperini.</p>
      <p>"It's important to get a result.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be a very tough match but thankfully we start again at 0-0.</p>
      <p>"We're going to stay true to the brand of football that has got us this far. Going to try and harness all our ability tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"No-one likes conceding a whole lot of goals but we're going to stay true to our brand of football in a prestigious stadium like the San Siro which is known all around the world.</p>
      <p>"For us, it represents an opportunity. With a positive result we'll stay in Europe, even if it's in the Europa League."</p>
