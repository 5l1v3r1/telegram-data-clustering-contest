      <h1>'Electric' atmosphere at Mosaic Stadium resonates with Saskatchewan Roughriders president-CEO Craig Reynolds</h1>
      <h2>Saskatchewan Roughriders president-CEO Craig Reynolds is the special guest on the latest Rider Rumblings video podcast.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/saskatchewan-roughriders-president-ceo-craig-reynolds-is-accountable-once-again">Craig Reynolds</a> wanted “sustained success” and, sure enough, everything is trending in that direction.</p>
      <p>Every year since 2015, when Reynolds debuted as the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ president-CEO, the community-owned CFL team has improved its victory total — going from three to five to 10 to 12 and, now, 13.</p>
      <p>The 13th victory, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-found-a-new-way-to-win-the-west">a 23-13 conquest of the Edmonton Eskimos</a> before 29,156 spectators at 33,350-seat Mosaic Stadium on Saturday, enabled Saskatchewan to clinch first place in the West Division for only the second time in a span of 43 seasons.</p>
      <p>Next up for the Roughriders is the West final, to be held Nov. 17 at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
      <p>Leading up to that game, Reynolds visited Leader Place on Tuesday to be the special guest on the Regina Leader-Post’s latest Rider Rumblings video podcast. Here is an edited transcript of his conversation with sports writers Rob Vanstone and Murray McCormick.</p>

        <b>Q: What do you make of this season? Does it qualify as a surprise to you or what’s your general take on it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I probably wouldn’t call it a surprise. I think some aspects of the season have been surprising. No one would have predicted some of the results of the season. I think at the beginning of the year, we knew we had a good football team. We had a good football team last year. We were 12-and-6. Did I think we’d be 13-and-5 (in 2019) and hosting the West final? I’m not so sure. But we set the goal every year of hosting a home playoff game. As the season went on, obviously a lot of things went our way. Obviously, full credit to the coaching staff. Those guys work tremendously hard. I’m very, very proud of the work that they do. And then, full credit to <a href="https://o.canada.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-begin-a-new-day-under-oday/wcm/55242794-88f6-4cd2-ac0d-46baa637f44b">Jeremy (O’Day, general manager).</a> There were lots of moves in the off-season that really paid dividends. Finding <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/riders-cody-fajardo-vows-to-be-ready-for-west-final">Cody Fajardo</a> was amongst that. I’m really, really proud of the entire organization.</p>

        <b>Q: What did you think when you saw <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-zach-collaros-deal-creates-an-unsettling-feeling">Zach Collaros</a> go down with a concussion, the result of an illegal hit, just three plays into the season?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: It’s one of those moments where you’ll never forget where you were. I was actually in Hamilton. I wanted to go on that particular road trip just because it was (head coach) Craig (Dickenson’s) and Jeremy’s first game. I was with Jeremy when it happened. At first, you’re angry, because of the hit. Once you calm down a bit, you’re really, really curious about what you have behind Zach. Not many people know this, but I remember in the off-season talking to Jeremy. There was obviously lots of conversation around the backup quarterback. I remember talking to Jeremy about that position and he indicated that he was going to go hard after Cody Fajardo. I’ll never forget it. He said, “I really think he can be a starter in this league.” So that gave me confidence, obviously. It’s a bit of a funny story. After the injury (to Collaros), after we sort of calmed down, I said, “Are you pretty confident in Cody being a starter in this league?” He said, “Well, we’re about to find out.” You never want that (injury) to happen to anybody. We think the world of Zach, and that was a very, very unfortunate incident. But my initial thoughts were that Jeremy had confidence in Cody and let’s see what we have here.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: Did you ever imagine anything like this, though?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I think you’d be lying if you said you predicted it. I had confidence in Jeremy and the things he said and why he believed he could be a capable starter. Getting to know the team and hearing about him at training camp, you understand the type of person he is, but I don’t think anybody could have predicted what we’ve seen. He’s just an incredibly quality human being. We see it day in, day out. He resonates so well in this market and that’s for good reason. It’s the way he is — his humility, his honesty, just the way he approaches things. He’s hard-working. He’s extremely tough. Every quality that you could imagine that’s going to resonate here in Saskatchewan, he has. On top of that, he has played so, so well. He has set so many first-year records and he has been a joy to watch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: You look up in the stands after that game (against Edmonton) and you see the people partying. Fans had been waiting 10 years to see first place.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: Absolutely. The atmosphere was electric. I’ll never forget that “Let’s Go Riders!” chant that broke out spontaneously. Those moments are what make sports so fantastic — the spontaneous fan moments. We do a lot on game day to try to generate something, but when you get our fans chanting like that … and it was so loud. I was in a booth and you can’t hear the announcements, but we could hear that. The whole stadium felt like it was vibrating. Unfortunately, finishing first in these parts doesn’t happen as often as it probably should. Since I was born, this is only the third time that it has happened, so I think you feel that from the fan base. It was really cool to watch them. Then we had a bunch of our fans on the field afterwards and our players came out in waves and were engaging with them. There was a roar every time a player came out. You could just tell they wanted to celebrate and I think we all felt that.</p>

        <b>Q: How do you balance that against the fact there were 29,000 people and change? I would have thought that for a game of such magnitude, 33,350 would have been automatic.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A: I can’t tell you how much time we’ve spent looking at this. It’s not just us. I know the league spends a ton of time as well. Thinking even broader, it’s an industry-wide trend. You see it in sports, but you also see it in entertainment. If I had the answer, I’d have this incredible consulting business, because you’d be out working with sports and entertainment organizations around this. So I don’t, and we don’t, have all the answers. But I can tell you what I do know — that it’s not just one thing. Is weather a factor? Yeah, weather is definitely a factor. Was it the only factor Saturday? No, absolutely not. But why do I know it was a factor? Because when we get the schedule out, we track daily sales of tickets, and that game just was not selling. The (Sept. 14) game against Montreal, which historically is a poorer draw, was selling at a great rate. (Saturday’s) game was against Edmonton, a traditional rival. When you look at the schedule (earlier in the season), it could be a very meaningful game, but it wasn’t selling. Obviously, people look at Nov. 2 and they think, “Maybe … maybe not.” We don’t need to talk about it too much, but the economy just being a little softer in Saskatchewan (is a factor). As much as we like to think that we’re a required spend, it’s a discretionary spend at the end of the day. I had lunch yesterday day with someone who is in the discretionary-spend business as well and they talked about how their business is down a fair bit, because people are just choosing how and when to spend their dollars, so there’s a bit of that. There’s increased competition that we’ve sort of seen over the number of years that continues to grow — the number of events, the number of activities, the number of options for your discretionary spend. I also think time is a factor nowadays. Time is the most valuable resource people have, and they’re stretched with their time, so Saturday at 2 o’clock is a busy time. Obviously, we wanted Saturday at 2 o’clock, because it helps with the weather challenge, but it also sort of hampers you on another side. We have incredible fans. Even though it was 29,000, it sounded like 33,000 in there, and they make such a difference. So we’re pushing really hard for the playoff game to sell that out. Tickets are moving very, very fast, so we’re excited about that.</p>
