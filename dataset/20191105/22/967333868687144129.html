      <blockquote>​Video shared on social media by Indiana resident Cindy Saucier shows <a href="https://twitter.com/Brat1st/status/1191706926423433217?s=20">Max and Leo</a>, her two six-month-old black kittens, running toward the television and later jumping onto the TV stand after the game’s coverage turned to a fellow black cat as it ran across the field.</blockquote>
      <p>However, these Indiana kittens weren’t the only members of the cat or dog communities to tune in.</p>

      <p>​As for the football field-storming black cat, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/monday-night-football-cat-takes-over-monday-night-football/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=76481813">reported</a> that it is one of the stadium’s “resident stray cats,” and that venue officials intend to capture it before transporting the feline to the veterinarian.</p>
      <p>Forget Air Bud, it’s all about Football Cat now, folks.</p>
