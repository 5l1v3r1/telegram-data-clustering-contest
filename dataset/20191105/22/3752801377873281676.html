      <p>Hundreds of Indian police staged a rare and angry protest on Tuesday after a row with lawyers that initially started over a parking space degenerated into ugly clashes.</p>
      <p>The two groups - who usually rub along in India's vast court system - have been at loggerheads since the weekend.</p>
      <p>The original dispute - over who had rights to a particular Delhi parking spot - escalated on Saturday with barristers setting fire to a police van and other vehicles as officers ransacked lawyers' chambers.</p>
      <p>Three advocates were shot, media reports said, as baton-wielding police charged gangs of learned men and women. In total at least 30 people were hurt.</p>
      <p>Video footage later emerged showing a fully-robed advocate punching and slapping a policeman as he attempted to flee on a motorbike, prompting Tuesday's protest.</p>
      <p>"We want justice. We also have human rights, the guilty lawyers must be punished severely," one of the protesting policemen told reporters.</p>
      <p>Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik urged demonstrators to resume work and promised to address their concerns.</p>
      <p>"The government and the people expect us to uphold the law, it is our big responsibility," Patnaik said.</p>
      <p>Lawyers, for their part, have also been protesting, with some threatening to go an indefinite strike.</p>
      <p>Social media users mocked the showdown between those tasked with upholding the law.</p>
      <p>"What times we are witness to! Agents of law and order - lawyers and police - are up against each other. This would go down in history," tweeted a former radio presenter.</p>
      <p>"I thought if police unnecessarily beat up someone, lawyers are there to demand justice. Now, lawyers are doing the beating up, and police are demanding justice," tweeted Ramesh Srivats.</p>
