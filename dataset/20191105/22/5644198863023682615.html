      <p>Federer has won the ATP Finals a record six times in his career - last winning the title in 2011 - while Djokovic has won it five times. Nadal has never won the tournament, losing in the final to Federer in 2010 and Djokovic in 2013.</p>
      <p>Nadal, who dethroned Djokovic at the top of the ATP rankings on Monday, pulled out of the semi-finals of the Paris Masters last week due to an abdominal injury but the Spaniard confirmed he is set to travel to London after undergoing a scan.</p>
      <p>The ATP finals take place between Nov. 10-17 and it is played in a round robin format, with the top two players from each group advancing to the semi-finals.</p>
