      <p>On a night that saw a Republican lose a governor's race, Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves is projected to defeat Democratic Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood on Tuesday to be the state's Mississippi's next governor.</p>
      <p>Reeves was leading Hood by 53-46 margin Tuesday with 94% of the vote tabulated. The race was expected to be a tight one, like the one that that saw Democrat Andy Beshear defeat Republican Matt Bevin in Kentucky.</p>
      <p>Polling conducted last month had Reeves winning by just 3 points.</p>
      <p>Despite its status as one of the most Republican states in the US, Hood has never lost a statewide race. He has won four times as state AG, all by double digits.</p>
      <p>Reeves and Hood were vying to replace Republican Phil Bryant, who has been term limited from running again. Republicans have remained control of the governor's seat for 16 years.</p>
