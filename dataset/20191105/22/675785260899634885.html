      <h1>Murderer Michael Stone loses freedom bid after trying to pin crimes on Levi Bellfield</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Michael Stone was jailed for life for the murder of mum and daughter Lin and Megan Russell in Chillenden, Kent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:10:19+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:10</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Young, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-young/</a></address>
      <p>Convicted murderer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-stone">Michael Stone</a> is set to lose a bid for freedom after failing to convince investigators that Levi Bellfield was the real killer of mum and daughter Lin and Megan Russell.</p>
      <p>Stone, 59, was jailed for life in a 2001 retrial for the brutal hammer attack on Lin and her six-year-old child.</p>
      <p>He has always protested his innocence and in 2017 his legal team launched an appeal with evidence of a “full confession” by Bellfield, the killer of schoolgirl Milly Dowler.</p>
      <p>But this week the application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission was denied an Appeal Court hearing, subject to a final ruling on December 2.</p>
      <p>The CCRC said last night: “We are effectively inviting applicants to make arguments to try to persuade us that our decision not to refer the case for appeal is wrong and should be changed.”</p>

      <p>Lawyers are understood to be meeting with Stone this week before they react to the CCRC response.</p>
      <p>The 1996 murder of Lin and Megan shocked Britain.</p>
      <p>The attack left Lin’s other daughter, Josie, then nine, with severe head injuries.</p>

      <p>Stone’s legal team claimed they had evidence of a “full confession” by Bellfield, in which he described to a fellow prisoner how he came across Lin and her children in Chillenden, Kent, and attacked them with a hammer.</p>
      <p>Stone’s lawyer Paul Bacon said in 2017: “We have identified forensic material from the scene of the murders which corroborates the confession.”</p>

      <p>Serial killer Bellfield, 51, is serving a whole-life tariff for abducting and killing Milly, 13, near her school in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in 2002.</p>
      <p>He was convicted of Milly’s murder while already jailed for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and Marsha McDonnell, 19, and attempted murder of Kate Sheedy, then 18.</p>
      <p>Stone failed in a previous application to the CCRC in 2010.</p>
