      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - A judge is expected to rule on a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on the sale of flavored vaping products.</p>
      <p>Superior Court Judge Brian Stern is slated to rule Tuesday afternoon on a temporary restraining order sought by the Vapor Technology Association and the owner of RI e-Cig and Vapes.</p>
      <p>The order would bar enforcement of the September ban.</p>
      <p>The Washington-based industry group argues that only state lawmakers have authority to ban the products. It also says the ban will hurt over 400 local businesses licensed to sell e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Gov. Gina Raimondo says she signed the executive order to protect children.</p>
      <p>The state plans to appeal and say the ban is still in place for nicotine products and recreational pot users.</p>
      <p>State health officials said that two residents have been treated for confirmed or probable cases of vaping-related lung illness.</p>
