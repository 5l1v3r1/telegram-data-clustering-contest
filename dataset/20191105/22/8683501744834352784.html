      <p>Last week, Sony announced that <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i> <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483678/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2s-official-release-date-has-been-announced">would arrive in theaters in spring 2022</a>, meaning it will probably be a while until we learn any specific plot details. However, just days after that release date information came in, it’s been revealed who <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2463571/what-spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2-will-be-about">the sequel</a>’s first new Spider-Man will be: Takuya Yamashiro, the main protagonist from the 1970s live-action Japanese Spider-Man TV series.</p>
      <p>This update comes straight from producer Phil Lord, because when a fan on <a href="https://twitter.com/philiplord/status/1191546906884788229">Twitter</a> offered to design the Japanese Spider-Man if he was written into <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i>, Lord responded:</p>
      <blockquote>He’s designed!</blockquote>
      <p>When we’ll see how <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i>’s version of Takuya Yamashiro looks remains to be seen. His original costume was just the traditional Spider-Man suit with thinner eyes, but it’s possible <i>Into the Spider-Verse 2</i> could give him a radically different look to make him stand out more.</p>
      <p>Either way, Japanese Spider-Man’s inclusion in <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i> isn't a complete surprise. At the beginning of this year, Phil Lord promised that if <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> crossed $200 million domestically, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464382/into-the-spider-verse-2-could-include-japanese-spider-man-on-one-condition">he would include this particular Web-Slinger in the sequel</a>. <i>Into the Spider-Verse</i> ended its theatrical run with a little over $190 million domestically, so it didn’t quite reach Lord’s goal, but evidently he and the other creative minds involved decided it was worth including Japanese Spider-Man regardless.</p>
      <p>Although Takuya Yamshiro may look like the traditional Spider-Man when suited up, that and the traditional spider-powers are all that he shares in common with Peter Parker. In the Japanese Spider-Man TV series that aired from 1978 to 1979, Takuya gained his special abilities through a blood transfusion from Garia, the dying warrior from Planet Spider.</p>
      <p>Takuya also received a special bracelet that contained his Spider-Man costume, his web-shooters and the ability to control Garia’s ship, The Marveller, which could transform into a giant humanoid robot named Leopardon. Takuya has also appeared in the Spider-Verse and Spider-Geddon comic book events, and Leopardon appears in the <i>Ready Player One</i> novel. It’s a good bet that <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i> will have Takuya piloting Leopardon too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462208/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-2-and-a-spinoff-are-already-happening">Sony gave the green light</a> to <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462932/why-spider-gwen-should-lead-the-planned-spider-verse-animated-spinoff">a female-led spinoff</a> in November 2018, a month <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> was released, due to the “incredible buzz” surrounding it. That proved to be the right call, as <i>Into the Spider-Verse</i> was <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2462587/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-review">met with critical acclaim</a> and later walked away with many accolades, including a Golden Globe and Academy Award.</p>
      <p><i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</i> will swing into theaters April 8, 2022, with Joaquin Dos Santos directing and David Callaham tackling the script.
