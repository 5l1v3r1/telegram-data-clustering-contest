      <h1>Joe Biden acknowledges he's losing ground to Democratic rivals</h1>

      <p>Joe Biden predicts reporters and pundits will go easier on him now that the Democratic race for the White House has tightened.</p>
      <p>The former vice president and White House hopeful teleconferenced with donors on Tuesday as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, both of whom outraised him by about $10 million over the summer, inch closer to him in the polls.</p>
      <p>Per a pool report, Mark Stutzman of New York, pressed Biden during the call on how the 36-year Delaware senator can convince Democrats he is both liberal enough to excite the party's activist base and a centrist able to appeal to independents and moderates so Democrats are best positioned to beat President Trump next year.</p>
      <p>“Well, I think what’s starting to happen, is the press is now starting to, I think it's fair to say, I'm not complaining and it's just a reality, that the press has spent an awful lot of time the last five months, challenging me," he responded, with a laugh. "Going after me. And now I think you see that change, now that other candidates have risen. Although we are still above 30% in the national polls, in almost every one. I think you're going to see more focus on the reality, and in the efficacy, and the straightforwardness of the plans being put together by other candidates. And I think we're now going to get into a comparative notion of who's for what and what can get done."</p>
      <p>Just two weeks ago, Biden insisted he was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joe-biden-i-know-im-the-frontrunner">the front-runner</a> for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
      <p>"I know I'm the front-runner. Find me a national poll with a notable — a couple exceptions — but look, this is a marathon," he told CBS' "60 Minutes" in October.</p>
      <p>Biden also inflated his support in the polls. Although he continues to lead Warren (20.6%) and Sanders (16%) in RealClearPolitics' averages with 29.1% of the vote, his popularity falls below his own 30% watermark. In the 24 surveys aggregated by RealClearPolitics last month, the former vice president only scored 30% or greater in 11, not even half.</p>
      <p>Last month, Biden's campaign finance woes were exacerbated by a backlash over his super PAC position reversal, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-says-i-didnt-change-my-opinion-after-reversing-position-on-dark-money-super-pac-cash">denying he'd shifted his stance</a> from condemning "dark money" political action committees to accepting their help.</p>
