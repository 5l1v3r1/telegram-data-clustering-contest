      <h1>Hootsuite CEO Ryan Holmes to step down, take on executive chairman role</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:49:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>VANCOUVER -- Hootsuite Inc. CEO Ryan Holmes says he plans to step down as head of the company.</p>
      <p>He says the Vancouver-based company has started a search for his replacement and that once found he plans to step into the role of executive chairman.</p>
      <p>Holmes, who <a href="https://twitter.com/invoker/status/1191779460619677697">announced the news on Twitter</a>, did not say why he had decided to step down.</p>
      <p>He founded the social media management company in 2008 and says it now has more than 1,000 employees supporting over 200,000 organizations.</p>
      <p>The company, which allows users to manage multiple social media accounts and provides analytics on them, announced some job cuts earlier this year as part of a realignment of its strategic priorities.</p>
      <p>The value of the private company has been a source of speculation, but Holmes said in 2017 that it was worth over a billion dollars.</p>
