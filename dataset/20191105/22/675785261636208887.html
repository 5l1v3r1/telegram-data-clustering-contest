      <h1>Chelsea must consider signing Hakim Ziyech after he leaves their defence in tatters</h1>
      <h2>The Moroccan forward was in dazzling form to provide two assists and force another error in a showcase of his talents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:32:12+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:32</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Lewis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-lewis/</a></address>
      <p>When the dust settles on this remarkable contest the man in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> notebook must surely be <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hakim-ziyech">Hakim Ziyech</a> .</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old who so tormented the home side here has already been recommended to the Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago Levy's former player, Rafael van Der Vaart, gave an interview to Dutch publication Voetbal Primeur revealing he is on a mission to get his countryman to White Hart Lane.</p>
      <p>"I really hope he goes to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ,” said Van der Vaart. “I sent a message to Levy. I said: ‘Get Ziyech after this season.’ I am convinced that he becomes a sensation in London.”</p>
      <p>Well he was right about that.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ajax-fc">Ajax</a> magician has either scored or assisted in nine of his last 12 Champions League appearances - four goals and 5 assists.</p>
      <p>This season he has scored seven times in all competitions. He didn’t add to that tally here but he did leave a talented Chelsea team in tatters with his skill, creativity and his delivery from the wide areas.</p>
      <p>It was his sumptuous, 20th-minute heat-seeker which found the head of Quincy Promes as he ghosted inside Cesar Azpilicueta to beat Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>
      <p>Ziyech then left the Chelsea keeper wondering, quite literally, what had hit him to put Ajax 3-1 up.</p>

      <p>Ten minutes before the break the Morocco international powered in a corner which cruised over every head waiting in the box, smacked the back post, rebounded into Kepa’s face and nestled in the back of the net.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes after the break Ziyech teed up Donny van der Beek to break home hearts again, this time from close range.</p>
      <p>Spurs fans must surely be licking their lips at the thought of Harry Kane feasting on his ammunition.</p>

      <p>Chelsea fans must be wondering whether their club will get in on that action with the prospect of their transfer ban being lifted in January.</p>
      <p>The years are catching up with Pedro (32) and William (31).</p>
      <p>Ziyech, however, has just under three years remaining on his current Ajax contract. The chase for his signature will be a hot one.</p>
