      <h2>Former Liverpool striker Michael Owen says Mohamed Salah has transformed in recent years and become "obsessed by goals"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:40:09+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:40</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Mohamed Salah has become "obsessed by goals", according to former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> striker Michael Owen.</p>
      <p>And the ex-England star believes Salah's success has transformed his mindset and style of play since he first arrived in England.</p>
      <p>Salah has come in for criticism for being greedy in front of goal at times this season, including a high-profile row with team-mate Sadio Mane which has since been resolved.</p>
      <p>And Owen, known for his prolific goalscoring during his stint at Anfield, outlined the "intriguing" transformation of the Egyptian ace after his performance against Genk in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Salah was unable to get on the scoresheet in a 2-1 win as he took a number of efforts in a bid to get back firing after scoring just five Premier League goals in 10 games so far this season, a low return by his remarkably high standards.</p>

      <p>Owen told BT Sport: "The way I read his game is I think you can tell his game has changed over the years.</p>
      <p>"Five years ago, watching him play, he would be beating players out wide, he'd be laying balls on.</p>
      <p>"He got the assist tonight, but he just looks to me nowadays like a really, really hungry player for goals, almost to the state where he's obsessed by goals.</p>

      <p>"That's definitely developed over the years with him. He never used to be obsessed with goals.</p>
      <p>"But now he's getting a taste of it. Now he's won Golden Boots, now he's been the main man, it's almost as if he feels a huge pressure to score all the time.</p>
      <p>"That's how I read him when I watch him play. I never, ever think he's going to pass in front of goal, it's almost as if he's got a one-track mind.</p>

      <p>"There's nothing wrong with that, it's certainly not a criticism, it's just intriguing how he's evolved over the years into being this real hungry goal-getter now.</p>
      <p>"Five years he certainly wasn't like that, and now you're watching him thinking 'wow, he's just zoned in on scoring goals'. He's such a goal-getter."</p>
