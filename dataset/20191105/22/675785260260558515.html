      <h1>Arsenal 'make transfer promise' to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang amid Real Madrid interest</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal's new captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is being linked with a transfer exit if the club don't return to the Champions League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T22:22:26+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal have reportedly promised Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang they will listen to offers if he decides he wants to leave the club.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang is yet to commit his long-term future to the Gunners and reports suggest he will consider moving on at the end of the season if they cannot secure a return to Champions League football.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://eldesmarque.com/madrid/real-madrid/noticias/174929-florentino-perez-mete-a-james-rodriguez-en-la-operacion-ultima-hora-en-el-real-madrid-ed">El Desmarque</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> president Florentino Perez is keen on a Â£69million move for the Gabonese striker, with the possibility of including James Rodriguez in a swap deal to lower the price.</p>
      <p>And they claim <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> chiefs have told Aubayemang they will be open to offers if he decides his future lies elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Aubameyang, who is under contract until the summer of 2021, is said to be keeping his options open rather than rushing into signing a new deal at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>He was named as the new Arsenal captain by manager Unai Emery on Tuesday after Granit Xhaka was sacked from the role over his outburst at fans when substituted against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>The striker was already involved in the leadership group at the Emirates, although a vote amongst players saw Xhaka given the nod before the season started.</p>

      <p>Aubameyang captained the side at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> on Saturday and opened the scoring, his 50th goal for the club, before they were pegged back and held to a 1-1 draw.</p>
      <p>The result means the Gunners are winless in their last three Premier League games, leaving them fifth in the table and looking set to face a huge battle to get back into the top four.</p>
      <p>They take on Vitoria in Guimaraes on Wednesday afternoon with Aubameyang not making the trip to Portugal for the Europa League game.</p>
