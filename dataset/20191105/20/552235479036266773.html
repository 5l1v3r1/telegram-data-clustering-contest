      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:08:57+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Granit Xhaka has been stripped of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> captaincy following his fallout with fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a> told Xhaka he was no longer part of the Gunners' leadership group as he named Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the new skipper.</p>
      <p>The Emirates boss said that the Swiss midfielder "accepted" his decision.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old was left out of his side's squad for their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> tie with Vitoria on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for the club since he told fans to "f*** off" when he was booed following his substitution against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>
      <p>He revealed death threats against his wife and messages wishing his daughter got cancer pushed him to "boiling point" and that is why he lashed out at fans.</p>
      <p>He said on Instagram: "My feeling of not being understood by fans, and repeated abusive comments at matches and in social media over the last weeks and months have hurt me deeply."</p>
