      <p>(CN) – Public opinion on President Donald Trump and his job performance remains hyperpolarized along party lines. And according to a poll released Tuesday, voters on both sides wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_110519/">Monmouth University poll</a> found most Americans’ opinions of Trump are unlikely to change, regardless of Trump’s actions. Over half (62%) of Trump supporters say they can’t think of anything Trump could do or say that would cause them to change their support, while 70% of those who disapprove of Trump say there is nothing he can do to earn their support – except resign from office.</p>
      <p>Both figures are notably up from earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, said this is the consequence of increased partisanship on both sides of the political spectrum.</p>
      <p>“These results suggest that the partisan tribes on both sides are digging in as the impeachment spotlight intensifies,” Murray said with the release of the poll.</p>
      <p>The impeachment inquiry continues to divide the public, with 44% of Americans believing Trump should be impeached and removed from office and 51% saying impeachment would be inappropriate. These results are virtually identical to impeachment numbers from September.</p>
      <p>Trump’s approval rating overall remains largely stable as well. The poll shows that 43% of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing while 51% disapprove, also little change from September’s polling data.</p>
      <p>A possible explanation for the static numbers: Most Americans regardless of party affiliation say they are not surprised by Trump’s conduct in office. Nearly 80% say Trump’s behavior does not surprise them, while just 7% say they have been somewhat surprised.</p>
      <p>Only 12% say Trump’s behavior over nearly three years in office has greatly shocked them.</p>
