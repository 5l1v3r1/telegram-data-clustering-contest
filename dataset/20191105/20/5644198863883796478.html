      <p>The World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) wants commercial sponsors to contribute financially to the fight against doping in sport as part of their corporate responsibility, the next WADA President said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>KATOWICE, Poland: The World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) wants commercial sponsors to contribute financially to the fight against doping in sport as part of their corporate responsibility, the next WADA President said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Witold Banka, Poland's Tourism and Sports Minister who will take over the WADA leadership from Craig Reedie on Jan. 1, said the organisation urgently needed to increase revenues and being a sponsor of sports events came with a responsibility.</p>

      <p>"I am not the Christopher Columbus of anti-doping policy. It is not a new idea to engage big sponsors as part of their corporate social responsibility," Banka told an international anti-doping conference.</p>
      <p>"That will be one of the biggest tasks: to convince the big companies to join the Olympic anti-doping solidarity fund," he added.</p>
      <p>WADA has a budget of about US$35 million (Â£27 million) annually while the overall spending on anti-doping around the world, including by national anti-doping agencies, does not exceed US$260 million.</p>
      <p>In comparison, broadcasters pay billions of dollars to secure rights of major sports such as the soccer World Cup and the Olympics.</p>
      <p>Olympic sponsors will pay the International Olympic Committee more than one billion dollars for the 2017-2020 quadrennium to be associated with the Games while broadcasters will pay about US$5 billion for Games rights for the same period.</p>
      <p>Banka said WADA had to find new streams of revenue if it was to continue its fight to root out cheats.</p>
      <p>WADA has been struggling with a vast Russian doping scandal for more than four years in a process that has required considerable funds.</p>
      <p>Russia's track and field team was banned from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016 while the entire Russian Olympic team at the Pyeongchang winter Games competed as independents as a result of that scandal.</p>
      <p>"We cannot keep raising contributions. We need to find some alternative solutions how we can increase the budget for anti-doping," said the 35-year-old Banka, a former European junior 400m champion.</p>
      <p>"We have to convince the biggest partners that if you are a sponsor of sport you have to be a sponsor of clean sport."</p>
