      <p>Mbappe has long been linked with a move to Real, but the LaLiga giants focused on other players in the most recent window.</p>
      <p>However, it seems Mbappe could become the club's main target after the 2019/20 campaign, with Zidane, who is usually very coy when it comes to discussing players from other clubs, recently stating that the French wonderkid has made no secret of his desire to play for the Spanish club.</p>

      <p>"At the moment, Mbappe is a Paris Saint-Germain player, and we will see in the future what will happen," he said, as quoted by <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"Mbappe always said that his dream was to play at Real Madrid."</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old, whose current deal only expires in 2022, joined Les Parisiens on an initial loan deal in August 2017 before the French giants made the move permanent the following campaign.</p>

      <p>Overall, they paid a reported €180 million (R2.95 billion) for his services, and Real will be expected to smash this fee if they want to lure him to the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
