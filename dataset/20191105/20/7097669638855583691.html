      <h1>Passenger dies at Penn Station despite rescue efforts by doctor on train</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T20:40:53+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 20:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.usatoday.com/travel/" target="_blank">Colleen Wilson, North Jersey Record</a></address>
      <p>A man who might have suffered a heart attack after boarding an NJ Transit train last night died while the train was at the New York Penn Station platform, according to the agency.</p>
      <p>NJ Transit is a New Jersey state-owned public transportation system. The man was Alfred Wood, a 63-year-old Middletown, New Jersey, resident, according to Amtrak.</p>
      <p>"At approximately 5:05 p.m. Monday, a conductor on board (North Jersey Coast Line) train 3363, which was loading customers at Track 7 at PSNY, was notified by a customer that a male customer in the third car did not feel well," NJ Transit spokesman Jim Smith wrote in an email to the <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/transportation/2019/11/05/nj-transit-passenger-dies-penn-station-despite-doctors-effort-save-him/4165748002/">North Jersey Record</a>, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.</p>
      <p>The Amtrak Police Department and EMS were notified by a train conductor that there was a possible heart attack in progress.</p>
      <p>"An on board announcement over the PA was immediately made asking for a medical doctor to come to the third car," Smith wrote.</p>
      <p>Smith said that a doctor responded to the announcement and was able to briefly revive the individual, but he later died. The train remained at the station until about 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Peter Martino witnessed the incident and the doctor's attempt to help the man.</p>
      <p>"He was performing CPR on the man and said he was breathing. When the doctor asked the NJ Transit conductor if they had, I believe he said mask, the conductor said, 'No,'" Martino said. "Then he asked if they had a BAG or anything, the conductor said, 'No, nothing.'"</p>
      <p>When asked whether NJ Transit trains are required to have resuscitation masks onboard, agency spokeswoman Nancy Snyder said they are not required, nor are defibrillators.</p>
      <p>Amtrak Police closed their investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>Federal Railroad Administration guidelines from the late-1990s require that "intercity" trains have a first-aid kit that includes a resuscitation mask, but that is not required of "commuter" trains, which is what NJ Transit is classified as.</p>
