      <h2>Partnership aims to fund academic research in 5G applications and applied sciences</h2>

      <p>What’s believed to be Canada’s first 5G-powered smart campus has gone live at the University of British Columbia.</p>
      <p>A statement from Rogers Communications said Tuesday university researchers can use it to test real-time 5G applications, as the company prepares to unveil a national network of the ultra high-speed mobile wireless system next year.</p>
      <p>The system is the fifth generation of mobile wireless, offering speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, making it about 100 times faster than 4G technology.</p>
      <p>It also has the potential for nearly instantaneous links between devices and cellphone towers.</p>
      <p>The university’s Point Grey campus includes several 5G towers and a computing and data storage facility similar to the cloud, but it saves time and bandwidth because it’s closer to where it’s required.</p>
      <p>The smart campus initiative is part of a multimillion-dollar partnership with Rogers aimed at funding academic research in 5G applications and applied sciences.</p>
      <p>Rogers said several research projects are underway, including development of earthquake and tsunami detection technology that takes advantage of the one- to two-millisecond connection time between transmitters and devices.</p>

      <p>The company said it’s continuing to test 5G in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Vancouver.</p>
