      <p>REUTERS: Steve Easterbrook, the chief executive officer of McDonald's Corp who was dismissed over the weekend, has resigned from Walmart Inc's board, the retailer said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, McDonald's, the world's biggest fast-food chain, said it had dismissed Easterbrook over a recent consensual relationship with an employee, which the board determined violated company policy.</p>

      <p>"Easterbrook's decision to resign was not due to any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to its operations, policies or practices," Walmart said in a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000010416919000077/form8-kx1142019.htm.</p>
      <p>Easterbrook joined Walmart's board in 2018 and was a part of the compensation and management development, strategic planning and finance committees.</p>
