      <p>MADISON, Wis. - An Alert Day is in the forecast for Wednesday morning. </p>
      <p>An Alberta Clipper system will move across the northern tier of the United States, bringing yet another round of light snow to southern Wisconsin. </p>
      <p>The snow will develop late Tuesday night and continue into Wednesday morning, with the heaviest snow between 3-9 a.m. Wednesday, right during the morning commute. </p>
      <p>With temperatures in the mid 20s during this time, impacts to travel will be likely as morning commuters will face snow- and ice-covered roads.</p>
      <p>Conditions begin to improve by the lunch hours, with mostly clear roads by the early afternoon. </p>
      <p>As the snow comes to an end, it's possible for some light rain to mix in across the south.</p>
      <p>This could be the case for places such as Janesville, Beloit and Monroe. The latest forecast models are bringing up to 4 inches of new snow to the area. </p>
