      <p>London - <b>Everton </b>midfielder <b>Andre Gomes</b> has been discharged from hospital just two days after suffering a horrific ankle break.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international had surgery on Monday on the fracture dislocation of his right ankle that he suffered during the second half of Sunday's 1-1 draw with Tottenham.</p>
      <p><b><i>"Following a successful operation yesterday, Andre Gomes has now been discharged from hospital and will continue his rehabilitation under the care of our medical team," </i></b>Everton said in a statement posted on the club's Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>Gomes fell awkwardly after being tackled from behind by Son Heung-min, who was subsequently sent off.</p>
      <p>The South Korean was distraught when he saw the extent of the damage to Gomes, but his red card was overturned on appeal on Tuesday.</p>
