      <p>Twenty-five years after releasing the ultimate holiday classic, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a29574761/mariah-carey-december-interview/?utm_campaign=likeshopme&amp;utm_term=www.instagram.com/p/B4ekS7Kl3Bu/&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=instagram&amp;utm_content=post">Mariah Carey is looking back at how she wrote "All I Want For Christmas Is You".</a> To hear her tell the story, it sounds rather easy to create one of the best selling Christmas single of all time. All she needed was a bit of Christmas cheer, and a little help from Jimmy Stewart.</p>
      <p>Carey told <i>Cosmopolitan UK </i>that to write the song, which, last Christmas Eve, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=all+i+want+for+christmas+is+you+spotify+streaming+record&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS724US724&amp;oq=all+i+want+for+christmas+is+you+spotify+streaming+record&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33l5.7270j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">set a one-day streaming record</a> on Spotify, she "just sat down, decorated a little tree and put on <i><i>It’s A Wonderful Life</i></i> and tried to get into that mood." The next day, she sat down with a keyboard and work on "little melodies and stuff. I was going over all the things I think about at Christmas time that make me happy," she continued, "and how to turn it around and make it into a love song."</p>
      <p>It's just as simple as that, Carey said. What isn't so easy for the pop star is celebrating the song's 25th anniversary. “I don’t acknowledge time,” Carey told <i>Cosmo UK</i>. "The more I hear [that it’s turning 25], the more I freak out. I’d rather just say it feels like it’s going to be a great anniversary for the album. We’ll call it a birthday."</p>
      <p>While calling this milestone a birthday rather than an anniversary might just seem like semantics to some, Carey swears it helps tamper her fear. "It’s not that it scares me," she says of "All I Want For Christmas Is You" turning 25. "It’s just if you don’t acknowledge time, you don’t have to deal with it.” A valuable life lesson from the Xmas queen who also taught us that saying <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2016/09/mariah-carey-i-dont-know-her-meme">"I don't know her" is enough to forget someone</a> you most definitely do know.</p>

      <p>At least, Carey is willing to remember this anniversary, er, birthday. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/mariah-carey-is-re-releasing-her-christmas-album-with-a-twist-18796136">she re-released her Christmas album</a>, with a bonus disc of new goodies like remixes and previously-unreleased live tracks from <a href="http://mariahcareynetwork.com/music/l-christmas94.html">Carey’s 1994 performance at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine</a> in New York City.</p>
      <p>Carey also dropped a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_aiaYkcSDo">new video for "All I Want For Christmas Is You,"</a> featuring unreleased footage of her prancing around in the snow. She might not acknowledge time, but the singer is, at the very least, happy to keep singing "All I Want For Christmas Is You" all season long.</p>
