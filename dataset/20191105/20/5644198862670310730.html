      <p>The Saudi government will be subject to a one-year restriction on selling additional Aramco shares in the oil company after a planned initial public offering (IPO), three sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>DUBAI/RIYADH: The Saudi government will be subject to a one-year restriction on selling additional Aramco shares in the oil company after a planned initial public offering (IPO), three sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>The government is looking to list 2per cent of the company on the Saudi bourse rather than listing the entire share capital on the exchange, the sources said.</p>

      <p>Normally public companies list the entire share capital on the exchange and have a portion of that as free float.</p>
      <p>Aramco was not immediately available to comment.</p>
      <p>Aramco, the world's most profitable company, fired the starting gun on a domestic IPO on Sunday, in what could be the world's biggest listing as the kingdom seeks to diversify its economy away from oil.</p>
      <p>Sunday's statement said Aramco and the selling shareholder will be subject to restrictions on the sale, disposition or issuance of additional shares, but did not provide the lockup period.</p>
      <p>Aramco roadshows will begin Nov. 18 and final pricing is scheduled for Dec. 5, sources said, adding Aramco is expected to start trading on Dec. 11.</p>
