      <p>Players have been exploring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/apex-legends/40486"><i>Apex Legends</i></a>’ new map for a few weeks now, and Respawn is finally ready to release its first balance changes. In the latest patch for <i>Apex Legends</i> season 3, Respawn adjusted the damage on a few weapons, and made some quality of life changes, but the biggest addition that <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/3-1-Patch-notes/td-p/8387933">patch 3.1</a> brings is the game’s new Firing Range mode.</p>
      <p>The Firing Range is exactly what it sounds like: a spot for you to practice your aim. The mode will let players load into a small arena, either alone or with a squad, where they can practice using all of the weapons in the game. There are target dummies spread around the arena, and weapons attachments for players to try out as well.</p>
      <p>A practice mode like Firing Range has long been one of <i>Apex Legends</i>’ most-requested features. As with most battle royale games, it’s hard to practice your aim during a normal match, where you may get a different gun every time you drop, or might only have one fight before you’re sent back to the lobby to start again. Thankfully, the Firing Range should provide a safer place for players to work on their aim, without the pressures of enemies who are actually trying to kill you.</p>
      <p>This patch also adds a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/30/20940470/apex-legends-duos-mode-release-dates-pc-ps4-xbox-one">Duos queue to<i> Apex Legends</i></a> which will be available from Nov. 5 to Nov. 19. For a full look at all of the changes coming to the game with patch 3.1 you can see the full patch notes below.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Apex Legends patch 3.1 notes</h3>
      <h3>WELCOME TO THE FIRING RANGE</h3>
      <p>From the lobby you can now select the firing range. Here you can practice playing around with all the weapons, items, and Legends.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can enter the firing range solo or with your squad.</li>

      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Weapons</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Wingman</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced the headshot multiplier: 2.15 -&gt; 2.1</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Changes to Projectile Collision:</b> We’ve increased the projectile width on the some weapons so they are easier to hit with. We made this change to the TripleTake in Season 2 and the following will be updated for this patch:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Shotguns:</b> All shotguns will have projectiles with a small amount of width.</li>
        <li>
          <b>L-STAR</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Snipers:</b> The Longbow DMR, Kraber, and G7 Scout.</li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Quality of life</b>
      </p>
      <p>In an effort to surface easier challenges to players more often and offer a balanced set of challenges each day, Daily Challenge distribution has been adjusted so players are guaranteed to receive 1 easy, 1 medium, and 1 hard challenge.</p>
      <p>You can now spend Legend Tokens to reroll Daily Challenges.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First reroll: 200 Legend Tokens</li>
        <li>Second reroll: 500 Legend Tokens</li>
        <li>Third or more reroll: 1000 Legend Tokens for each reroll.</li>
        <li>Cost increases with each purchase before capping out at 1000 Legend Tokens.</li>
        <li>Cost resets every day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can now adjust the game cursor velocity in Settings -&gt; Controller. This will apply to cursor velocity in all menus including the Lobby, Pause/Inventory menus, and Death Box inventories.</p>
      <p>We now show you what Music Pack you have selected while dropping into the map. If you only have the “default” Pack selected you won’t see anything.</p>
      <p>Improved flow from Lobby to Match that fixes some minor bugs and will hopefully get players into matches a bit faster.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Disabling pregame spawning of players before character selection. This will address cases where players might hear someone voice comms or other sounds before the Legend selection starts.</li>
        <li>The “Waiting for Players...” transition now shows the game world instead of a black screen.</li>
        <li>Removed the 5 second countdown that would start at the beginning of Legend selection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Player will now be able to view the ammo types of their squadmates equipped weapons when in the inventory menu.</p>
      <p>[Controller] you can now open the quip wheel by holding down on the dpad (you can still do it the old way - open ping menu and press Y)</p>
      <p>[PC] Quick Chat binding should now auto bind to F1 if it isn’t bound to anything (assuming nothing is already bound to F1)</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Ranked Mode</h3>
      <p>Players will no longer receive a penalty for abandoning a match if they leave after 2 and a half minutes have passed since their Banner was picked up after dying. As a reminder: players will be warned via the menus if their leaving may trigger abandon penalties; if the warning does not show up players are free to leave.</p>
      <hr/>

      <ul>

      </ul>
      <hr/>
