      <p>“We said we’ve got to do the minimum of three films [together], we don’t know what the next one is yet, we have done two and we still have the next one to go,” he explained.</p>

      <p>The pair first worked together on <i>Eddie The Eagl</i>e in 2016 before reuniting for this year’s <i>Rocketman</i>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the chat, Fletcher discussed Egerton and John’s close bond. “They admired each other’s talent and they’re friends, there is a friendship there, it’s very real, and it’s very lovely to be around and see,” he said.</p>
      <p>Upon <i>Rocketman</i>‘s release, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-praises-taron-egerton-singing-rocketman-soundtrack-2491639">Elton John praised the lead actor’s “extraordinary” singing on the film’s soundtrack</a>. He added that said Egerton’s work “blew his mind” when he heard the results on record.</p>
      <p>“What he’s done is quite extraordinary because he sounds like me, but he also sounds like Taron,” he said. “And that’s down to Giles [Martin, producer] giving him the confidence in the studio as well.”</p>
