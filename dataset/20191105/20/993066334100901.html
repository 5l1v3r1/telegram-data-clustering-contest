      <p>Facebook has faced calls to ban all political advertising ahead of the forthcoming General Election, after a number of misleading ads were taken down from the platform.</p>
      <p>The social network’s rules require all political advertising to be labelled, so users can get information about who paid for them.</p>
      <p>However, in the past three days several adverts have been taken down for being incorrectly labelled, including some paid for by the Government.</p>

      <p>Ian Lucas, an outgoing member of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) sub-committee on disinformation, said: “I think it’s very difficult to see how Facebook can adequately prevent misinformation.</p>
      <p>He told the PA news agency: “I think they are going to see a considerable number of complaints about misleading advertising throughout this election, and it does concern me – it’s an issue I have seen growing.</p>
      <p>“One of the big debates we are having is around targeted ads. The danger of these adverts is being dismissed.</p>
      <p>“Removing political adverts is the right decision for democracy.”</p>
      <p>Facebook has faced increasing pressure to remove political ads after Twitter announced it would do so from November 22.</p>
      <p>One advert taken down in recent days was published by a page called the Fair Tax Campaign, a lobbying group run by former Boris Johnson aide Alex Crowley.</p>
      <p>The sponsored advert asked: “Could you afford an extra £214 each month? That’s what Labour’s tax plans would mean for EVERYONE.”</p>

      <p>However, Labour has yet to publish its tax plans or manifesto ahead of the election.</p>
      <p>Between £400 and £499 was spent on the advert, which largely targeted men over the age of 65 in England. It was seen up to 40,000 times.</p>
      <p>When contacted by the BBC, Mr Crowley said the ad was based on a New Economics Foundation report from August, adding that his campaign had no links with the Conservative Party.</p>
      <p>Last Friday the Government was accused of misusing taxpayers’ money to target voters in key swing constituencies with Facebook ads.</p>
      <p>At least 17 adverts, promising up to £25 million investment in towns across the UK, were deactivated after they were not correctly labelled. However, a Government spokesman said the adverts had been due to expire anyway.</p>
      <p>They went live on the day the General Election was announced.</p>
      <p>Unlike traditional advertising, there is no way of regulating what is said on targeted Facebook ads.</p>

        <figcaption>Last Friday a series of adverts from the My Town campaign were taken down for not being labelled political adverts (Facebook)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>These ads only appear in specific newsfeeds for profiles they are targeting.</p>
      <p>If they are not correctly labelled political adverts – as was the case with both the Fair Tax Campaign and My Town adverts – it is difficult to know who is seeing them.</p>
      <p>After the Fair Tax Campaign ad was removed, Conservative Damian Collins, who chaired the DCMS sub-committee, tweeted: “First strike in the campaign against sketchy political ads on Facebook.</p>
      <p>“People shouldn’t be able to place political adverts online if we can’t see who is paying for them. The same rules that apply offline should apply on the internet.”</p>
