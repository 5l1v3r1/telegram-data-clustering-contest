      <h1>Rob Reiner: 'Breathtaking' Number of Americans Support This 'Lying Racist Criminal'</h1>
      <h2>Film director and far-left activist Rob Reiner believes a “breathtaking” number of Americans support the “lying racist criminal” of President Donald Trump.</h2>

      <p>Posting his rant to Twitter and while never saying the president’s name, Reiner argued that despite his large base of support, Trump supporters still remain in the minority.</p>
      <p>“There has always been racism. There has always been ignorance,” the <i>When Harry Met Sally </i>director said. “There have always been people subject to the lure of a cult. The sheer volume of Americans who willingly follow this Lying Racist Criminal is breathtaking. But they are still the minority. We will win.”</p>

      <p>It is not the first time that the 72-year-old filmmaker, who takes to Twitter practically every day to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/09/19/rob-reiner-donald-trump-defecating-on-our-constitution/">rant and rave</a> about Trump and the current administration, has complained about the behavior of his fellow Americans.</p>
      <p>In July, Reiner declared that Trump’s supporters are racist, presumably including the millions of black and ethnic minorities who support his agenda.</p>
      <p>“The President of the United States is a racist. He’s made it abundantly clear his re-election is based on white nationalism,” the Hollywood director said at the time. “If you support him, there can be no distinction between you being a racist and a racist enabler. They are the same.”</p>

      <p>In March, Reiner also described Trump’s supporters as “insidious,” declaring that they condone his so-called belief in “white supremacy.”</p>
      <p>“The President of the United States is a racist. He supports and promotes white supremacy &amp; white nationalism,” he wrote. “If you are part of this insidious cult, you condone that. Period.”</p>
