      <p>After some excitement about a new logo for the Edge browser, Microsoft has finally pushed out<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Discussions/Dev-channel-update-to-80-0-320-3-is-live/m-p/984711"> a new Edge Dev build</a>, taking the browser to build 80.0.320.3.</p>
      <p>The Edge Dev Build 80.0.320.3 changelog brings the following new features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-is-rolling-out-the-new-edge-logo-to-the-canary-dev-and-beta-channels/">new Edge logo for Windows 10 Insiders</a></li>

      </ul>
      <p>The official Edge Dev Build 80.0.320.3 changelog  also notes the following known issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extensions that are installed from the Chrome Web Store aren’t getting automatically updated. We expect the fix for this issue to be in today’s Canary and next week’s Dev.</li>
        <li>The fix for the issue where Edge’s first launch leads to a blank white window didn’t make it into this week’s build. We now expect it next week.</li>
        <li>There are some issues where users with multiple audio output devices sometimes don’t get any sound from Edge. In one case, Edge becomes muted in the Windows Volume Mixer and unmuting it fixes it.  In another, restarting the browser fixes it.</li>
        <li>At certain zoom levels, there is a noticeable line between the browser UI and the web contents.</li>
        <li>Some users were still seeing screenshots that are automatically taken by the feedback tool turn out garbled or all black. Another potential fix for this is expected next week.</li>
        <li>Jumplist entries are not consistent between the Start Menu and the Task Bar for some users. We believe this is due to the shortcut on the Start Menu not getting migrated properly after an Edge update and are working on a fix.</li>
        <li>Sometimes the browser will appear to not respond to any user input (clicking or scrolling in webpages doesn’t do anything, hovering over UI doesn’t make it change), but clicking on certain buttons still works (like the … menu). The cause of this is due to an error in the GPU process, and opening the browser task manager (right-click near the window minimize/maximize/close buttons or hit shift+esc on the keyboard) will open a window that will allow you to end the GPU process, which will fix the issue.</li>
      </ul>
