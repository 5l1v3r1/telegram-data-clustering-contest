      <p>Knicks rookie RJ Barrett isn’t the face of New York sports, at least not yet, but he does appear to be enjoying life in the Big Apple.</p>
      <p>Not only that, Barrett is doing a great job of getting accustomed to the sports scene in and around NYC, which is what he did on Monday night, when he attended the Cowboys-Giants game at MetLife Stadium.</p>
      <p>A number of NYC’s stars hit up the primetime showdown, with Barrett among them. He even showed his support for the G-Men with this video message on the field before the game.</p>
