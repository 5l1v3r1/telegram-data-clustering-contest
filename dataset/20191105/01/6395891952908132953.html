      <p><b>LEXINGTON, Ky.Â (AP)</b> - The Latest on President Donald Trump's rally in Kentucky (all times local):</p>
      <p>8 p.m.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is praising an ally's call to unmask the intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint served as the catalyst for Democrats' impeachment probe.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a rally in Kentucky Monday, Trump says GOP Sen. Rand Paul's call for the whistleblower to be publicly named was "excellent."</p>
      <p>Paul claimed at the rally that the whistleblower's identity is known, adding, "I say to the media, do your job and print his name."</p>
      <p>U.S. whistleblower laws exist to protect the identities and careers of people who bring forward accusations of wrongdoing by government officials. Lawmakers in both parties have historically backed those protections</p>

      <p>7:55 p.m.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is calling incumbent Gov. Matt Bevin a "pain" on the eve of Tuesday's Kentucky gubernatorial election, but he says he means it in the nicest way.</p>
      <p>Addressing a campaign rally Monday in Lexington, Kentucky, Trump said Bevin has frequently prodded him to help court businesses to relocate in his state and bring federal dollars to the state.</p>
      <p>Trump says, "He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want."</p>
      <p>The Republican Bevin is facing Democratic state Attorney General Andy Beshear in Tuesday's election.</p>
      <p>The bitter Kentucky contest is being watched closely for early signs of how the increasingly partisan impeachment furor in Washington might affect Trump and other Republican incumbents in 2020.</p>

      <p>Republican Gov. Matt Bevin gets to bask in the campaign finale he wanted - an election-eve appearance with President Donald Trump just hours before Kentucky voters choose between him and Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear.</p>
      <p>The Monday evening rally at Rupp Arena in Lexington will reinforce one of Bevin's main themes throughout the bitter gubernatorial campaign - his alliance with Trump, whose popularity eclipses the governor's in the Bluegrass State.</p>
      <p>Trump tweeted support for Bevin on Monday morning, saying he "has worked really hard &amp; done a GREAT job." Thousands of people, many wearing Trump shirts and hats, gathered inside Rupp Arena hours before the rally.</p>
