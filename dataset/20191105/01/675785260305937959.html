      <h2>Footage of the disturbing 'prank' shows the man putting himself at risk when the firework is lit while between his cheeks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T01:14:40+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 01:14</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A man was caught on camera launching a firework rocket from his backside in a dangerous stunt. </p>
      <p>Safety experts slammed the reckless behaviour after footage circulated on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>The video shows another man lighting a firework held in the other's bottom.</p>
      <p>As the fuse is burning, sparks appear to melt his top, with a friend shouting 'it's burned up your back, your t-shirt's wrecked'.</p>
      <p>When the main charge ignites, the man sprints forward and desperately throws his arms back to knock the pyrotechnic away.</p>

      <p>It appears the firework burned his backside as it launched.</p>
      <p>The rocket then explodes on the ground after the man successfully hits it off him.</p>
      <p>It's not known when or where the clip was filmed but a man off camera can be heard speaking in a Scottish accent.</p>
      <p>The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10279221/rocket-between-bum-cheeks/">The Sun</a> : “It doesn’t take a bright spark to know not to toy with fireworks.</p>

      <p>“Historically, around 1,000 people visit A&amp;E for treatment of a firework-related injury in the four weeks around Bonfire Night.</p>
      <p>“We recommend families enjoy fireworks at an organised display and follow the Firework Code, which can be found on our website.”</p>
      <p>The clip appears to have been posted on Twitter by a Swedish user, who captioned the post: "Remember remember the 5th of November by doing stupid s*** like this."</p>

      <p>Several Twitter users blasted the man for his behaviour, with one commenting: "Again.. proof as to why women live longer than men."</p>
      <p>Another added: "Probably wouldn’t quite have killed him but could easily have blown a massive chunk of his back off."</p>
