      <p>MSNBC's <i>Morning Joe </i>hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski spent only four seconds on their show to mention President Trump was leaving New York to avoid the steep taxes.</p>
      <p>Brzezinski mentioned the move in a brief of morning headlines but failed to mention where and why the president was leaving New York.</p>
      <p>Trump announced Thursday that he was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-becomes-florida-man-after-declaring-mar-a-lago-his-permanent-residence">moving his permanent residency</a> from New York to Florida to avoid paying more in taxes.</p>

      <p>Page Six <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/01/26/the-tax-strategy-behind-joe-and-mikas-florida-studio/">reported</a> in January that the hosts of <i>Morning Joe</i> had also moved their legal residency to Florida in order to save over $500,000 a year in taxes. Scarborough registered to vote in Florida in October 2018.</p>
      <p>The couple have a home studio they film in with a Washington, D.C., backdrop in order to meet residency requirements.</p>

      <p>The two have been fierce critics of the president, but neither has offered any commentary of what they think of his move to Florida to avoid a higher tax burden.</p>
