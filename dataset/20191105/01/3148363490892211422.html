      <h1>Paul Torches Media on 'Whistleblower': 'Do Your Job and Print His Name'</h1>
      <h2>Senator Rand Paul criticized the establishment media on Monday, demanding that they report on the “whistleblower” who kicked off the impeachment inquiry with his complaint.</h2>

      <p>“We also know the name of the whistleblower, the whistleblower needs to come before Congress as a material witness because he worked with Joe Biden at the same time Hunter Biden was getting money from corrupt oligarchs,” Paul said.</p>
      <p>Trump invited Paul to the podium to address Kentucky Republicans at his rally at Rupp Arena in Lexington, Kentucky.</p>
      <p>Paul said that Hunter Biden was getting $50,000 a month from a corrupt Ukrainian gas company simply because of his connections to Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>“I say tonight to the media, do your job and print his name!” Paul shouted as the crowd cheered.</p>
      <p>The identity of the so-called “whistleblower” was <a href="https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2019/10/30/whistleblower_exposed_close_to_biden_brennan_dnc_oppo_researcher_120996.html">publicly revealed</a> in October by Real Clear Investigations, but the establishment media has not reported it.</p>
      <p>He praised President Trump for continuing to fight the media, despite the ongoing obsession with coverage about impeachment.</p>
      <p>“President Trump has great courage, he faces down the fake media every day,” Rand Paul said.</p>
      <p>The senator of Kentucky urged his Republican colleagues to have “equal courage” to fight the Democrat effort to impeach the president.</p>
      <p>Both the whistleblower and Hunter Biden should be subpoenaed, Paul said, in order to get the truth.</p>
      <p>“I say to my colleagues, if Shifty Schiff will not let Hunter Biden come, and will not bring the whistleblower forward, every Republican in Congress should take a walk and say, ‘This is a farce,'” Trump said.</p>
