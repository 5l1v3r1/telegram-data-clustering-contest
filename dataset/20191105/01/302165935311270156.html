      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 5 — Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades said his country should terminate the passport of fugitive financier Low Taek Jho if reports of its existence are verified.</p>
      <p>Anastasiades’ country came under global attention after it was alleged that Low, or Jho Low, used its so-called “golden passport” scheme to effectively purchase his citizenship there.</p>
      <p>“Absolutely yes,” Anastasiades told reporters yesterday, according to the <i>Cyprus Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>“And there may well be others [requiring review] which have not come out in public.”</p>
      <p>However, he said this would only be after a full investigation is carried out with respect to due process.</p>
      <p>Anastasiades also sought to contain the fallout over the “golden passport” programme that also allegedly benefited eight Cambodian elites with ties to the country’s authoritarian regime.</p>
      <p>Cyprus previously launched an investigation into those cases specifically as part of a system-wide audit announced following the revelations.</p>
      <p>The president of Cyprus reiterated that any citizenship issued as a result of violations would be cancelled, before saying that the matter should not be exaggerated.</p>
      <p>“If, for example, among the some 4,000 citizenships granted, it is found that 10 or 15 may not be up to par, I don’t think that it justifies all this uproar so that — and it might be down to honest mistakes — we drag our country’s name through the mud.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday, another Cypriot news outlet, <i>Politis</i>, revealed that Low applied for and secured the passport through the government-backed Cyprus Investment Programme (CIP), with the alleged endorsement of the country’s Christian Orthodox Archbishop Chrysostomos II.</p>
      <p>Until recently, Low had been thought to be hiding out in China and controlling his remaining business interests from various parts of the country.</p>
      <p>After his US$1 billion (RM4.15 billion) settlement with the US Justice Department last week, however, a spokesman of Low appeared to taunt authorities by saying he was offered asylum “by a country that acts in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Convention on Human Rights.”</p>
      <p>Low remains wanted by authorities in Malaysia, the US and Singapore.</p>
