      <h1>Anthony Davis doesn't rule out signing with Bulls in free agency</h1>

      <p>Most people would assume that Anthony Davis is a virtual lock to re-sign with the Lakers in free agency after he and his agent basically expedited a trade from New Orleans to Los Angeles this past offseason, but not so fast.</p>
      <p>Asked at a Nike event in Chicago if he’d ever sign with the Bulls, Davis, a Chicago native, didn’t rule it out:</p>

      <p>When Davis was traded from the Pelicans to the Lakers last June, he didn’t commit to re-signing with the team even though his agent, Rich Paul, also represents fellow Laker LeBron James. The rebuilding Bulls probably wouldn’t present Davis an opportunity to win a ring like the Lakers could, but we’ve seen players choose to play for the hometown team before.</p>
      <p>This isn’t what Lakers fans probably want to hear from Davis, but it’s possible he may have been just playing to the crowd.</p>
