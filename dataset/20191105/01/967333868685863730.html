      <p>Spain’s National Security Department website <a href="https://www.dsn.gob.es/es/actualidad/sala-prensa/ciberataques-ransomware-04-noviembre-2019">announced on Monday</a> that a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201907051076159454-spain-detains-biggest-cybercriminal/">virus attack targeted</a> a number of Spanish companies, including the Cadena SER radio network, a chain of local and countryside radio stations. The cyberattack has affected local SER broadcasts, but has not affected its national output.</p>
      <blockquote>“We have been recommended not to work on our computers in a network environment,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-cyber-ransomware/cyber-attack-hits-spanish-companies-including-radio-network-idUSKBN1XE1YJ">Reuters quoted a source</a> at the station.</blockquote>
      <p>The Spanish National Security Department has not identified additional victims of the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201908011076432063-raunchy-bait-brand-new-android-ransomware-targets-porn-lovers/">reported ransomware attack</a>.</p>
      <p>Everis, a Spanish IT company, reportedly was also targeted in the cyberattack, after which it informed employees to turn off computer devices before sending them home. A spokesperson for the company has refused to comment about the claims, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>Spain’s National Security Department <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201905191075126154-instagram-hackers-got-hacked/">published a warning about the ongoing ransomware attack</a> and recommended preventive measures for users to follow.</p>
      <blockquote>“Among the recommended measures which several companies and organizations are carrying out, is to disconnect from networks that equipment that does not have the latest updates to prevent new infections,” a Security Department announcement read.</blockquote>
