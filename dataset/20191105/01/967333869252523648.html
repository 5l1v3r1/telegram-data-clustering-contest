      <p>With both the Conservatives and Labour having pledged to significantly increase the funds available for various social programmes thus far. But will said levels of spending; actually be possible without severely <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911031077214718-britain-boris-johnson-brexit-interview/">increasing taxes and damaging business</a>? Or is this merely an example of two sides vying for vital political capital?</p>
      <p>Journalist David Lindsay shares the views on the matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sputnik: Could pledges for further investment in public services made by both the Conservative and Labour Parties realistically be carried out?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>David Lindsay:</b> It can be done. A sovereign state with its own free floating currency has as much of that free flowing currency as it chooses to issue to itself.</p>
      <blockquote>The election will result in a hung parliament, beyond that I will predict absolutely nothing, that’s become a fools game now, but there is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911031077214690-effort-to-instigate-propaganda-lawmaker-calls-out-soros-over-educational-anti-brexit-initiative/">going to be another hung parliament</a>, I’ve no idea who’s going to be the largest party; it would be either the Conservatives or Labour, but I’ve got no idea which one.</blockquote>

        <b>Sputnik: Could a second Brexit referendum be on the cards now that Article Fifty has been postponed until January 2020?</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote><b>David Lindsay:</b> A second referendum is now really very likely because the extension period has now gone into 2020, and if that happened, as it now has; there was always a very high chance of a second referendum taking place.</blockquote>

        <b>Sputnik: What would the British public’s reaction be if a second Brexit referendum was held and the UK’s departure from the EU was ultimately cancelled?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>David Lindsay:</b> There would be great anger among many of the leave voters, but it’s very difficult to say what anyone could really do about it, and it would leave a scar that would last for the rest of many people’s lives, it <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911041077218984-jeremy-corbyn-boris-johnson-brexit-debate/">would be definitive of British political activity</a> for as long as I was left alive.</p>
