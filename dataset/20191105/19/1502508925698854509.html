      <h1>Offshore derivatives: Sebi eases guidelines for hedging instruments</h1>
      <h2>The eligibility norms for NRIs/OCIs, however, have been retained according to the erstwhile circular.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:41:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Coutinho</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/securities-and-exchange-board-of-india">Securities and Exchange Board of India </a>(Sebi) on Tuesday issued operating guidelines for overseas investors, largely in line with the recommendations in the HR Khan Committee report.</p>
      <p>The regulator has eased conditions for hedging offshore derivative instruments (ODIs), allowing <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/foreign-portfolio-investors">foreign portfolio investors </a>(FPIs) to issue these instruments with derivatives as underlying if they take up separate registration specifically for ODI issuances.</p>
      <p>The eligibility norms for NRIs/OCIs, however, have been retained according to the erstwhile circular. Earlier, ODI issuers were co-mingling their proprietary and hedging positions, and it was difficult to establish one-to-one linkage, said experts.</p>
      <p>The norms say FPIs won’t be allowed to issue ODIs referencing derivatives, and that no FPI shall be allowed to hedge its ODIs with derivative positions on Indian bourses.</p>
      <p>However, derivative positions taken on exchanges for ‘hedging of equity shares’ held by FPIs in India, on a one-to-one basis, will be permitted through a separate registration by an ODI-issuing FPI, under Category-I. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>has clarified that “hedging of equity shares” means taking a one-to-one position in only those derivatives that have the same underlying as the equity share held by the FPI in India.</p>

      <p>“An ODI-issuing FPI may hedge the ODIs, referencing equity shares with derivative positions in Indian stock exchanges, subject to a position limit of 5 per cent of market-wide position limits for single-stock derivatives. The permissible position limit for stock index derivatives is higher of Rs 100 crore or 5 per cent open interest,” said the guidelines.</p>
      <p>“The guidelines are a step in the right direction for realising the dream of ‘ease of access’ for FPIs, by simplifying registration and KYC requirements,” said Suresh Swamy, partner at PwC India.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>has reiterated that only FPIs domiciled in regions under the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) can get Category-I status and issue ODIs. Officials from Mauritius’ Financial Services Commission had recently asked <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>to reconsider its stance of allowing only FATF members to be eligible for category-I status.</p>
      <p>FSC officials had also asked Sebi to tweak the guidelines to allow funds from FATF-compliant regions to register as category-I FPIs.</p>
      <p>Regulated entities such as banks and asset managers may undertake investments on behalf of clients — only as Category-II FPIs, and only if those clients are individuals or family offices.</p>
      <p>Central banks that are not members of the Bank for International Settlements will be allowed to register as category-II FPIs, provided the applicant is regulated by the banking sector regulator in its home jurisdiction. This would enable central banks from Mauritius, Cyprus, and West Asia to invest as FPIs.</p>
