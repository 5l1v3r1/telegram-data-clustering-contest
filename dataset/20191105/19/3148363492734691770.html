      <h1>Antifa Viciously Beat Female Real Estate Employee in Her Own Home</h1>
      <h2>German far-left Antifa extremists broke into the apartment of a real estate company employee and viciously beat her in an ongoing war against a luxury apartment development in Leipzig.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:05:50+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Tomlinson</a></address>
      <p>The attack saw two far-left extremists invade the apartment of the 34-year-old real estate worker at around 7 p.m. on Sunday and hit her in the face with their fists several times, according to police spokesman Andreas Loepki, German tabloid <i>Bild</i> <a href="https://www.bild.de/regional/leipzig/leipzig-news/gewalt-linke-chaoten-ueberfallen-und-verpruegeln-frau-34-65805320.bild.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>After the attack, Loepki said that the Antifa extremists told the woman: “Goodbye, ‘Greetings from Connewitz.'”</p>
      <p>The Connewitz area of Leipzig has long been <a href="https://www.zeit.de/2017/36/leipzig-connewitz-autonome-linksextremismus">associated with Antifa</a>, as the group even boasts its own <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AntifaConnewitz/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
      <p>The Antifa group has been at war over the development of several construction sites across Leipzig this year, setting two cranes on fire on October 3rd at a site run by the same company the 34-year-old female victim works for and causing an estimated ten million euros in damages.</p>

      <p>According to police spokesman Loepki, the home invasion and assault is an entirely new tactic from the far-left extremists.</p>
      <p>“There were already comparable home visits from the left spectrum. But they have always been against right-wing extremists,” he said.</p>
      <p>Leipzig Lord Mayor Burkhard Jung, a member of the left-wing Social Democrats (SPD), also condemned the violence saying: “A line has been crossed: the militant left scene does not even shy away from attacks on defenceless women.”</p>
      <p>“The line spread by the extreme left-wing scene, that they are violent only against things and state institutions, but not against people, is exposed for what it always was: a lie,” he added.</p>

      <p>“The rule of law must be applied consistently. We have to be careful that in the current debate about right-wing terrorism, we do not lose sight of left-wing extremism and its contempt for humanity, which is not inferior to that of the right-wing,” he said, warning that political murders by the left could be on the horizon.</p>
      <p>The extremists involved in the attack took credit on the far-left publishing platform Indymedia, saying they “decided to meet those responsible for building a problematic project in the south of Leipzig where it really hurts: in their face”.</p>
      <p>Indymedia has been used time and time again by Antifa extremists in Germany to take credit for acts of violence and sabotage including the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/01/10/alleged-antifa-confession-to-attack-on-german-populist-mp-emerges-online/">attempted assassination</a> of populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) MP Frank Magnitz earlier this year in Bremen.</p>

      <p>Antifa extremists also published an <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/02/02/assassination-guide-directed-at-german-populists-posted-on-antifa-linked-site/">“assassination guide”</a> on the platform in February with tips on how to kill AfD politicians and other political enemies.</p>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/08/29/german-police-alt-left-extremists-committed-2000-crimes-hamburg-g20/">over 2,000 crimes</a>, including the assault of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/07/11/500-police-injured-g20-german-leaders-vow-clamp-left-wing-terror/">hundreds of police officers</a>, by black bloc Antifa extremists at the Hamburg G20 in 2017, the German government<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2017/08/27/germany-shuts-major-alt-left-extremist-website/"> shut down</a> the notorious “Linksunten” site hosted on Indymedia.</p>
      <p>The site was well-known as a place not only for extremists to brag about attacks, but also to give each other advice on how to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/05/22/german-antifa-far-left-extremists-release-riot-tourist-instructional-terror-handbook/">sabotage infrastructure</a> and build weapons, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2018/03/17/police-uncover-antifa-hoard-chemicals-high-explosives-mobile-bomb-factory-germany/">including explosives</a>.</p>
