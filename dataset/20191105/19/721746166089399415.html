      <h1>Teamfight Tactics patch 9.22 change list</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:01:30+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.polygon.com/users/Julia%20Lee" target="_blank">Julia Lee</a></address>
      <p>Teamfight Tactics’ patch 9.22 is a big one, as it’s bringing Set 2, Rise of the Elements, with it.</p>
      <p>There is so much to cover in this patch that they’re not even in the notes. If you want a list of all the new units, elements, and classes, <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/teamfight-tactics-lol/2019/10/21/20925184/tft-set-2-units-origins-classes-list">we have that in a different place</a>.</p>
      <p>The patch notes below features all of the other sweeping changes, including tweaks to items, the ranked system, and the champion pool numbers. This set of Teamfight Tactics is definitely going to require even more brain power than the last set, so make sure you keep your eyes on your enemies.</p>
      <p>This patch also comes with a new set of cosmetics for Teamfight Tactics: buyable map skins! The skins are Freljord-themed, and you can pledge allegiance to Sejuani, Ashe, or Lissandra.</p>
      <p>As usual, you can check out Riot Games’ <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/teamfight-tactics-patch-922-notes">full patch notes</a> or <a href="https://www.riftherald.com/lol-patch-notes/2019/11/5/20950006/league-of-legends-patch-9-22-notes-changes-senna">our <i>League of Legends</i> notes</a>, if you were looking for Summoner’s Rift changes.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>General Game Changes</h3>
      <p>We made a few systemic changes in preparation for Rise of the Elements. The board size change will allow for additional options and decisions to make the optimal formation for any given situation. Many of the other changes account for the champions and synergies in the new set.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Board size: 3 rows of 7 hexes &gt;&gt;&gt; 4 rows of 7 hexes.</li>
        <li>Player Damage: 3/3/3/4/5/6 &gt;&gt;&gt; 2/3/4/5/6/7</li>
        <li>Summoned units don’t deal player damage by themselves, but they count as as if their Summoner was alive if at least 1 of them survives the round.</li>
        <li>Level 8 Champion drop chances per Tier level: 15/20/35/22/8 &gt;&gt;&gt; 15/20/35/24/6</li>
        <li>Once you pick up a champion from the carousel, your Little Legend will no longer collide with your opponents.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Ranked Changes</h3>
      <p>New season, new rules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ranked is off during patch 9.22, it will return with patch 9.23.</li>
        <li>Placing 4th or better will never deduct LP. Placing 5th or lower will never reward LP.</li>
        <li>We’re slightly decreasing the number of challenger and grandmaster slots in many regions in order to make sure that the master to challenger ranks have the appropriate distribution of players.</li>
        <li>Korea, Vietnam, China: 300 Challengers, 700 Grand Masters.</li>
        <li>EU West and North America: 200 Challengers, 500 Grand Masters.</li>
        <li>All other regions: 50 Challengers, 100 Grand Masters.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Champion Pool Changes</h3>
      <p>We’re decreasing the number of each champion in the pool. It will be much more difficult for multiple players to build similar teams. Keep an eye on what your opponents are building and find the open synergies for maximum success.</p>

        <li>Tier 1: 39 &gt;&gt;&gt; 29</li>
        <li>Tier 2: 26 &gt;&gt; 22</li>
