      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/six-year-old-boy-helping-20816636">Edinburgh's</a> world famous Christmas Market will not open until it's deemed safe, council officials confirmed.</p>
      <p>Worrying footage of wonky scaffolding balancing on a slope in Princes Street Gardens sparked outcry on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Corstophine Climate Action shared the concerning snap on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The post read: "Apparently no planning application or safety inspection - Christmas Market platform.</p>
      <p>"Will you risk it?"</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/news/edinburgh-news/edinburgh-councillors-not-shown-controversial-17166443">Edinburgh Live told</a> how the company behind the Capital’s Christmas market was handed a two-year contract extension, without councillors being shown the design of a controversial steel platform structure yet to receive planning permission.</p>
      <p>It was signed off by the culture convener and his deputy.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh City Council have since launched an investigation into whether correct processes were followed.</p>
      <p>Droves of punters from all over the world head to the Christmas Market over the festive season, generating millions for the local economy.</p>
      <p>The platform needs to be sturdy enough to hold thousands of people at the one time, with over 100,000 visitors per day.</p>
      <p>The 2019 market is set to open on November 16.</p>

      <p>Labour councillor Gordon Munro told BBC News: "I would like assurances that this work, that has obviously been rigorous, in taking four months to be undertaken, also takes into account the figures that are being talked about - up to 124,000 people accessing the Christmas market.</p>
      <p>"Is that structure able to cope with that load-bearing should those numbers be replicated? Does it take into account the weight of the goods that will be there as well? We need reassurances in that regard."</p>
      <p>A City of Edinburgh Council spokesperson said: "The latest stage is that a building warrant application has been submitted and is currently being assessed.</p>
      <p>"The application includes an SER certificate from an approved certifier of design of building structures, which demonstrates compliance with the regulations."</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman from Underbelly, the firm behind the market, said: "The structure in East Princes Street Gardens is safe.</p>
      <p>"The design has been signed off and certified by independent engineers who have issued an SER certificate, and it has also been agreed by the council's engineers.</p>
      <p>"It has been designed in accordance with the appropriate codes to comfortably accommodate the capacities expected by Edinburgh's Christmas through its busiest periods and in all weathers.</p>
      <p>"The installation is also subject to a building warrant and is therefore compliant with the Building (Scotland) Regulations."</p>
