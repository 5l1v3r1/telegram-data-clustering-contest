      <p>Rangers will travel to Dubai as the club revealed their plans for the winter break.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> will try to prepare his side for what will be a crucial second half of the season.</p>
      <p>And he hopes a trip to the UAE for a warm-weather training camp will stand them in good stead.</p>
      <p>The first team will travel to Nad al Sheba Sports Complex from January 6 to 12, a place where the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, AC Milan and Juventus have trained.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> will conclude their time abroad with a friendly, but the club have yet to confirm who they will face.</p>
      <p>The Ibrox side will join Celtic as Neil Lennon's squad will also jet out to Dubai with their time off in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Last season Gerrard's men were top of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> table on goal difference going into the winter break, after a win over their rivals, but surrendered that marginal lead in their first game after the restart.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock came from behind to win 2-1 at Rugby Park as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> came flying out the blocks to regain control at the top thanks to an eight-game winning streak.</p>
