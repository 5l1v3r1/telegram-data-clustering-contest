      <p>SOMERVILLE, New Jersey (WABC) -- The New Jersey Department of Health issued an alert after a case of hepatitis A was confirmed in a supermarket worker in Somerset County.</p>
      <p>Officials say the worker is a food handler at a ShopRite on Davenport Street in Somerville, and they are working to notify people who shop at the store.</p>
      <p>The person reportedly worked during the time when they were able to spread the virus to others, also known as the infectious period, from October 13 to October 30.</p>
      <p>The health department recommends that anyone who thinks they may have been exposed should contact a health care professional immediately, and any items purchased from the in-store deli during that time should be thrown away.</p>
      <p>Anyone who ate items purchased there during that time and who was not previously vaccinated against hepatitis A was advised to get the hepatitis A vaccine.</p>
      <p>Experts say that to be effective, the hepatitis A vaccine should be received as soon as possible, but no later than two weeks after eating food from this deli. For most people, this date would be November 13.</p>
      <p>Hepatitis A is usually transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or consumption of contaminated food or water. Most adults with hepatitis A have symptoms including fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice, which usually resolve within two months of infection. Most children less than 6 years of age do not have symptoms or have an unrecognized infection.</p>
      <p>Anyone who used the restrooms at the ShopRite should also consider getting vaccinated.</p>
      <p>The Somerset County Department of Health will host a special walk-in clinic to provide free hepatitis A vaccinations at the county Human Services Building, 27 Warren Street, Somerville, from noon to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 6, and Thursday, Nov. 7. Free parking is available in the parking deck next to the building.</p>
      <p>For additional questions, call the Somerset County Health Department hotline at 908-203-6014.</p>
