        <figcaption><b><a href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/6098711514001">2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 test drive<br/></a></b>The 2020 Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 is no one-trick pony. The most powerful Ford ever is as happy on a twisty track as it is on a drag strip, Fox News Automotive Editor Gary Gastelu says.</figcaption>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/make/ford">Ford</a> decided to shock this year’s SEMA auto show in Las Vegas with an all-electric Mustang concept.</p>

      <p>The prototype coupe features a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/auto/attributes/electric">battery-powered</a> drivetrain from automotive sunroof and electric drive system supplier Webasto.</p>

      <p>The Mustang Lithium has a 900 hp motor pack with 1,000 lb-ft of torque under its windowed hood and uses a next-generation 800-volt electrical system designed to handle gobs of power while reducing the amount of heat produced. To put that in perspective, the most powerful conventional Ford ever made is the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/auto/test-drive-the-2020-ford-mustang-shelby-gt500-is-the-most-powerful-ford-ever">2020 Mustang Shelby GT500</a>, which has a supercharged V8 rated at 760 hp and 625 lb-ft of torque.</p>

      <p>While Ford didn’t release any performance numbers for the Lithium, one feature should spark the interest of car enthusiasts: a six-speed manual transmission. Electric cars typically don’t have--or even need--more than one gear, so the inclusion of a stick is all about adding a fun-to-drive element.</p>

      <p>The body and suspension are equipped with various parts from the Ford Performance bin and the otherwise stock Mustang interior is accented with electric blue trim. There is also a tech-forward 10.4-inch infotainment screen that can be used to select from four driving modes labeled Valet, Sport, Track and Beast.</p>
