      <p><b>Muscat:</b> Indian nationals and Persons of Indian Origin in Oman who have low incomes can apply for higher education scholarships for their children under the Sponsorship Programme for Diaspora Children (SPDC)<br/><br/>The programme is open to all those families that earn less than $5,000 per month (about OMR 2,000), but preferences will be given to families with lower incomes. For more information, and to apply online, candidates are requested to visit <a href="http://www.spdcindia.gov.in/">www.spdcindia.gov.in</a><br/><br/>A statement from the Ministry of External Affairs of India said, “The government of India offers scholarships to Persons of Indian Origin (PIOs), Non Resident Indians (NRIs) and Overseas Citizens of India (OCIs) and workers in Gulf countries, to pursue undergraduate courses in Indian universities and institutes in different fields.”<br/><br/>The scholarship programme, however, is not valid for those who wish to pursue degrees in the medical and other related fields. Financial assistance up to 75 percent of the tuition fee will be provided, up to a total of $4,000 per annum. The scholarship includes payment of tuition fee, admission fees and post-admission services.</p>
      <p>“150 scholarships with 50 earmarked for children of Indian workers in ECR (emigration check required) countries will be allocated,” added the ministry. “One-third of these 50 scholarships will be reserved for those students of workers in ECR countries who are already studying in India.”<br/><br/>Scholarships will be offered to courses run in the central universities of India offered undergrad courses, as well as institutions that have been granted an A grade from the National Assessment and Accreditation Council.</p>
