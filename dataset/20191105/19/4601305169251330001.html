      <p>This is the easiest way to weigh your luggage at home, before you get to the airport and find out your bag is too heavy and have to pay a hefty overweight fee. To use it, you place the strap around a handle on your luggage and lift. The weight is displayed on an illuminated readout (you can switch it between lbs and kgs). I've had one since 2015 and it's much better than trying to weigh your luggage on a bathroom scale. Amazon sells them for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backlight-Display-Dr-Meter-Electronic-Temperature/dp/B00XVB48E4?SubscriptionId=AKIAI7YNKHYQQBPVQ3WQ&amp;tag=boingboing&amp;linkCode=alb&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B00XVB48E4">$7.79</a></p>
