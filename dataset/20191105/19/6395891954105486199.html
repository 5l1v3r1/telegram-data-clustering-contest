      <p>Wilmer Abrego, 22, of Lake Worth, was charged with grand theft auto and two counts of kidnapping, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.</p>
      <p>According to an arrest report, Abrego saw a Toyota Highlander parked in front of a West Palm Beach mobile home park Friday night, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/pbso-man-stole-car-with-two-children-inside-from-mobile-home-park">WPTV</a> reported. The vehicle was running and there were two children inside, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>According to the Sheriff's Office, Abrego crashed the vehicle and tried to flee on foot before he was arrested, <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/man-admits-to-stealing-womans-car-with-two-children-inside">WPEC</a> reported. </p>
      <p>There were no injuries, the Sheriff's Office said.</p>
      <p>Deputies said Abrego admitted he stole the SUV but denied knowing there were two children inside, <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/pbso-man-stole-car-with-two-children-inside-from-mobile-home-park">WPTV</a> reported.</p>
      <p>According to deputies, the mother of the children said she left her SUV running around 9:30 p.m. and went into her home, heard a noise and then saw her vehicle pull away, <a href="https://cbs12.com/news/local/man-admits-to-stealing-womans-car-with-two-children-inside">WPEC</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Abrego remains in the Palm Beach County Jail, ineligible to post bail because he missed a court hearing on an unrelated case, according to court records.</p>
