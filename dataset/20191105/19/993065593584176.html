      <p>Gemma Atkinson will return to the Strictly Come Dancing ballroom for the show’s Christmas special just six months after giving birth.</p>
      <p>Mark Wright, Joe Sugg, Debbie McGee, Chizzy Akudolu and Richard Arnold will also dust off their dancing shoes for the all-star festive episode on BBC One on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>The former soap star, who welcomed Mia with Strictly professional Gorka Marquez in July this year, was runner-up in the 2017 series.</p>

      <p>Atkinson, 34, and 29-year-old Marquez met on Strictly in 2017, when she was partnered with Aljaz Skorjanec and he was dancing with Alexandra Burke.</p>
      <p>Atkinson said she was “overjoyed” to be returning to the show that “changed my life”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I had the absolute best time on Strictly and it completely changed my life so I am absolutely overjoyed to be returning to the dancefloor this Christmas with a new challenge, and of course to be back with the gang!”</p>

      <p>Sugg, who competed last year, said: “I’m really excited to have a go on the Strictly ballroom floor again this Christmas.</p>
      <p>“Strictly feels like a home away from home for me so I will be giving it my best shot and ending the year on a high.”</p>
      <p>Reality star Wright said: “It’s been a while since I was on the dancefloor but I’m very much looking to forward to dusting off the dance shoes for Christmas!</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait to be back – let’s get going!”</p>
      <p>The social media star found romance with his professional partner, Dianne Buswell, and the pair are still together.</p>

      <p>The special episode will also see the return of McGee, who reached the final of the 2017 series, and Akudolu, who became the first celebrity to be eliminated that year.</p>
      <p>McGee, who rose to fame alongside magician husband Paul Daniels, said: “I thought all my dreams came true two years ago when I was asked to do the series, but to be one of the rare people to be invited back to do the Christmas Special is the icing on the cake.</p>
      <p>“I can’t wait to be back dancing with my Strictly family”.</p>
      <p>Akudolu said: “I am so excited to be coming back to Strictly this year, and being able to get back on the dancefloor once again!</p>
      <p>“I’m still the biggest fan of Strictly so it’s wonderful to be back with old friends, in front of and behind the camera, and hopefully some new ones for Christmas.</p>

      <p>“Bring on the sparkle, and maybe an odd 10 – it is Christmas after all…!”</p>
      <p>Celebrity journalist Arnold added: “I can’t wait to get back out on the dance floor and throw shapes beneath the glitter ball once again.</p>
      <p>“I just can’t promise you’ll recognise them or that they’ll be in any particular order.</p>
      <p>“What I can promise is that one of us will be a professional.”</p>
      <p>The programme will be hosted by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, with Craig Revel Horwood, Motsi Mabuse, Bruno Tonioli and head judge Shirley Ballas dishing out the critiques.</p>
      <p>The professional dancers and pairings will be revealed in due course.</p>
      <p>The Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special will air on BBC One on Christmas Day.</p>
