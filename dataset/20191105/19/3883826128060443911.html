        <b>Tottenham forward Son Heung-min's red card for his tackle on Andre Gomes has been overturned by the Football Association.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tackle led to the Everton midfielder's <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50283980">horrific ankle injury,</a>.</p>
      <p>Referee Martin Atkinson initially showed Son a yellow card before he changed it to red.</p>
      <p>The South Korea forward was sent off for serious foul play but an independent regulatory commission has upheld a claim of wrongful dismissal.</p>

      <p>"Son was devastated after the action," said Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>"It was a mix of everything; it was a mix of the injury, a mix of the red card, the situation of the game - it was an emotional moment for everyone.</p>
      <p>"Now after a few days, everyone is available to play. He is in a very good way. He feels sorry like everyone, but he is in good form."</p>
      <p>Television replays suggested that Gomes suffered the injury after Son's tackle and before he collided with full-back Serge Aurier.</p>
      <p>Gomes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50303433">has been released from hospital</a> after surgery to repair a fracture dislocation to his right ankle.</p>
      <p>Explaining Atkinson's decision, the Premier League said: "The red card for Son was for endangering the safety of a player, which happened as a consequence of his initial challenge."</p>
      <p>Pochettino said the forward had no intention of injuring Gomes and believed the video assistant referee system should have been used to overturn the sending off.</p>
      <p>"I was confident," said Pochettino about the decision being overturned. "We were all confused after the game. I was talking with different people and the referee, too.</p>
      <p>"There was confusion, but now it is completely fair that in the end he is not going to be suspended.</p>
      <p>"But we cannot change the result. Playing with 10 men opened the game for them and we ended losing the two points."</p>
