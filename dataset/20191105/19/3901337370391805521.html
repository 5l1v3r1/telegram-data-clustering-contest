      <p>Daniel Akpeyi, the penalty shoot-out hero for Kaizer Chiefs in their victory over rivals Orlando Pirates at the weekend, has once again come in for praise from his coach Ernst Middendorp, who described him a special player.</p>
      <p>Following a 2-2 draw in open play of the Telkom Knockout quarterfinal between the two Soweto giants, it was left to Akpeyi to see Amakhosi through.</p>

      <p>Akpeyi hasn’t always been the flavour of the month for club supporters, who took time to warm up to the Nigerian keeper after he joined from Chippa United in January.</p>
      <p>“He is very grown up and he always performed. I understand why there was criticism in the beginning. He arrived to help the club with Itumeleng Khune injured and that was enough to make him a bad goalkeeper,” Middendorp told reporters.</p>
      <p>The coach also gave credit to goalkeeper coach, Lee Baxter.</p>
      <p>“I think there’s always an element of working on it too, but as I said he is very grown up, experienced and knowing where he has been – the World Cup – he talked a lot about it. And don’t forget it, the work that was done by goalkeeper coach Lee Baxter is very qualified – and that has helped with this outside drama. He has done well, is performing and is something special,” said Middendorp.</p>
