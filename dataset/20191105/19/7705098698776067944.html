      <h1>Anthony Daniels Is Open To Someone New Playing C-3PO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:27:15+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:27</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Next month, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b></a> will mark the end of an era. That means saying goodbye to old friends fans grew close to over the years — including C-3PO. However, Anthony Daniels recently spoke to <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2019-11-03/star-wars-actor-says-he-wont-be-the-last-to-play-c-3po-hes-too-big-of-a-character-to-die-with-me/">Radio Times</a> about the possibility of someone new taking over the role, no matter what happens. He believes his character shouldn’t simply fade away.</p>
      <p>“There are people wandering around Disney theme parks, dressed in better suits than mine,” explained Daniels. “They seem to move a lot more easily. And quite right: he is too good a character, too big of a character, to die with me. And Disney paid a lot of money for him! You know what I mean? They’ve got to get their money back somehow.”</p>
      <p>C-3PO’s fate hasn’t been decided yet, but the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/469912-final-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-ends-the-saga">latest trailer for <b>Rise of Skywalker</b></a> indicates he’s ready to accept it. When asked what he’s doing, he replies, “Taking one last look, sir…at my friends.” </p>

      <p>Disney hasn’t really made any future plans with <b>Star Wars</b> outside of the latest movie. <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/game-of-thrones"><b>Game of Thrones</b></a>’ David Benioff and D.B. Weiss <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/470400-breaking-david-benioff-d-b-weiss-depart-star-wars-trilogy">recently backed out</a> of directing a new <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> trilogy.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, Daniels is thankful for this time in the role. <a href="https://twitter.com/ADaniels3PO/status/1089990744855728130?s=20">Earlier this year on Twitter</a>, he expressed gratitude in working with him one last time. </p>
      <p>“Today was 3PO’s last on <b>Episode IX</b>,” wrote Daniels. “He’s sad – so am I. But we’re so proud to have worked with such a lovely, talented cast &amp; crew lead by J.J. &amp; Kathy. I’ll miss everyone but I’m glad to know that we’ve been making something exceptional together, to share with the waiting world.”</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b> opens in theaters on December 20.</p>
