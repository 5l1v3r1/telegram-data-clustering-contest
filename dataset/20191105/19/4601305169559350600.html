        <b>Man used electric shopping cart to get from one bar to another</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Louisiana gentleman who enjoys consuming large amounts of alcohol tried a novel way to avoid drunk driving charges or a DUI conviction.</p>
      <p>Go barhopping in an electric shopping cart.</p>
      <p>His method does not seem to have entirely worked out for him, despite being clever.</p>
      <p>The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office in Louisiana reports in this news release that one Brice Kendell Williams, 32, is charged with having removed the cart from a Walmart in Houma to a bar about half a mile (0.8 kilometers) away, during a drunken spree last Sunday.</p>

      <blockquote>Col. Terry Daigre says a deputy found the cart parked between two cars in the bar’s parking lot.<br/><br/>The sheriff’s office says Williams told the deputy he thought he might get charged with DWI if he drove his own vehicle from bar to bar.<br/><br/>Williams was arrested nevertheless, and charged with felony “unauthorized use of a movable.” It’s unclear whether he had an attorney to speak for him.</blockquote>
