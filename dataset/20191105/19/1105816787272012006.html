      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Despite assurances by the Afghan foreign ministry, Pakistani diplomats continued to be harassed by intelligence officials in Afghanistan even after Islamabad conveyed its concerns to Kabul, sources told <i>The Express Tribune</i> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>After frequent reported cases of Pakistani diplomatic personnel’s harassment in the war-torn country, the Pakistan Foreign Office on Sunday summoned the Afghan chargé d’affaires and conveyed serious concerns over the safety and security of embassy staff in Kabul and its sub-missions.</p>
      <p>Diplomatic sources said that the visa section of the Pakistan embassy in Kabul remained closed for the third consecutive day which came as a huge blow for many Afghans, hundreds of whom apply daily for permits to travel to Pakistan where they seek medical treatment, goods and university educations.</p>
