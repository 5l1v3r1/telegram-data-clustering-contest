      <h1>Report: Omari Akhmedov meets Ian Heinisch at UFC 245 in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:00:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lucas Rezende</a></address>
      <p>A middleweight bout has been the latest addition to the already stacked UFC 245 card. Per <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/">ESPNâ€™s report</a>, Ian Heinisch will take on Omari Akhmedov at the upcoming Las Vegas card.</p>
      <p>Undefeated in the Octagon for the past three years, Akhmedov (19-4-1) defeated the likes of Kyle Noke, Abdul Razak Alhassan, Tim Boetsch and most recently Zak Cummings. He won those bouts by decision and also fought Marvin Vettori to a majority draw back in 2017. The last man to defeat the 32-year-old was Elizeu Zaleski in April 2016.</p>
      <p>After two successful UFC outings, in which he defeated both Cezar Ferreira and Antonio Carlos Junior via unanimous decision, Heinisch (13-2) hit a bump in his last fight, dropping a unanimous decision to veteran Derek Brunson, back in August.</p>
      <p>Now, Akhmedov is expected to meet Heinisch at UFC 245, on December 14, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The card is scheduled to be headlined by a welterweight title fight between the champion, Kamaru Usman, and former interim title holder Colby Covington.</p>
      <p>Additionally, two more title bouts are scheduled on the same night. Featherweight king Max Holloway will fight Alexander Volkanovski, and champ-champ Amanda Nunes will defend her featherweight belt against former title holder Germaine de Randamie.</p>
