      <p>The actor was snapped as he stepped out with his father <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rishi-Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a>, mother Neetu Kapoor, sister Riddhima Kapoor Sahni with her daughter. It was the first time that the whole family was snapped together.</p>
      <p>For the night, Ranbir and Rishi were twinning in blue while Neetu opted for a black and Riddhima was in pink. The family was all smiles for the pictures. The 'Jagga Jassoos' actor looked cool as he was sporting glasses.</p>
