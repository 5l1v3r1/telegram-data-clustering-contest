      <p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 6 November.</p>

      <p><b>The world’s people face “untold suffering due to the climate crisis” unless there are major transformations to global society</b>, according to a stark warning from more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/climate-crisis-11000-scientists-warn-of-untold-suffering">11,000 scientists</a>. There is no time to lose, they say: “The climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected. It is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/05/most-countries-climate-plans-totally-inadequate-experts">more severe than anticipated</a>, threatening ecosystems and the fate of humanity.” The scientists say the urgent changes needed include ending population growth, leaving fossil fuels in the ground, halting forest destruction and slashing meat eating. Meanwhile, the economist Ross Garnaut says Australia could set a path to 100% renewable electricity, a highly reliable grid and significantly cheaper wholesale prices by introducing a handful of policies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy">consistent with the </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/ross-garnaut-three-policies-will-set-australia-on-a-path-to-100-renewable-energy">government’s election platform</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The NSW police performed strip-searches on more than 100 girls in the last three years</b>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/06/revealed-nsw-police-strip-searched-more-than-100-girls-including-12-year-olds">including two 12-year-olds</a>. After the police watchdog’s investigation into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/21/police-strip-searched-16-year-old-girl-at-splendour-music-festival-inquiry-hears">allegedly illegal strip-search of a 16-year-old girl at a music festival</a>, data obtained under freedom of information laws show she was just one of 122 under 18 who have been forced to undergo the controversial practice since 2016. The revelations come after the watchdog revealed last week that it had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/03/nsw-police-watchdog-fully-investigated-just-2-of-firehose-of-complaints">investigated six </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/03/nsw-police-watchdog-fully-investigated-just-2-of-firehose-of-complaints">allegations of misuse of strip-search powers </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/03/nsw-police-watchdog-fully-investigated-just-2-of-firehose-of-complaints">last year</a>.</p>

      <p><b>The Australian National Audit Office has blasted the administration of a $200m program </b><b>to boost regional jobs and growth</b>, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/05/coalitions-200m-regional-jobs-and-investment-program-fails-to-meet-audit-standards">an audit found</a> found that ministers declined to fund 28% of grants recommended by officials, and approved 17% that had not been recommended to them.</p>

      <p><b>Governments seem intent on trashing John Howard’s legacy when it comes to water reforms</b>, writes John Williams. “At a time when the World Economic Forum continues to urge that water be given high-level strategic attention as one of five global issues, it appears our Australian governments are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/06/governments-seem-intent-on-trashing-john-howards-legacy-when-it-comes-to-water-reforms">walking away from water reform</a> and its strategic management and reverting to myths and delusions. Yet for over a quarter of a century, Australia has been at the forefront of progressive water reform from policy to implementation and the evolution of institutional governance. Not any more.”</p>

She’s Lebanese after all and, like millions of other Arab families – especially in the diaspora – our food is an integral part of our cultural identity.”</p>

But perpetual sunshine can feel relentless, oppressive even. Everything is washed out in its yellow glaze. In the build-up there is tension, and a longing for release. How long can we go without rain? It happened on Sunday … a massive, game-changing and hugely joyful amount of rain. It smells like childhood and high summer, relief and restoration.”</p>

      <p>Bita is an Iranian refugee who came to Australia by boat and was sent to Nauru. She has chronic back pain and mental health issues and her doctors on Nauru recommended she be transferred to Australia for medical treatment. While waiting, her back pain became so severe she had to use a wheelchair. Under the medevac law passed last year, Bita was transferred to Australia for care. But the government is intent on repealing medevac. What does the law actually do and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/nov/06/the-fight-over-medevac-and-the-people-caught-in-the-middle">what will happen to people like Bita if it is repealed</a>?
