      <p>For the Independent</p>
      <p>PatchouliMint Spa Ltd. in Stettler has been honoured with the 2019 Customer Service Award, being nominated for creating a supportive and helpful environment at the spa.</p>
      <p>PatchouliMint Spa Owner Julie Mack says that the whole team is “honoured and thankful” about the recognition.</p>
      <p>“I cannot accept this award alone by any means; it’s all six of us who got that award,” Mack said of her staff and co-workers.</p>
      <p>“The girls I have here are awesome, as well as our clients and customers,” she added.</p>
      <p>PatchouliMint Spa Ltd., located in the upstairs of 5004 – 50th Ave., started two years ago and has a large clientele base. Mack has been a massage therapist for the past 14 years, with a cohort of employees who have between eight to 10 years of experience.</p>
      <p>“As an owner, I feel very lucky to have the people I have working with me,” she said. “We, as a whole group, all deserve this award, each and every one of us.”</p>
      <p>PatchouliMint Spa Ltd. is a full day spa with an array of services, such as manicures, artificial nails, pedicures, massages, facials, body waxing and eyebrow microblading, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>“The award means a lot because we want to make people happy and want to provide services that make them feel comfortable and welcome,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It means a lot that we are being recognized for our attitude here and that people are noticing it.”</p>
      <p>When asked how she came up with the name for her business, Mack says she actually got the idea from her daughter who was 12-years-old at the time. Patchouli-Mint is an essential oil blend, which was in a hand cream favoured by Mack.</p>
      <p>“So she said, ‘You should name it that’,” Mack said acknowledging her daughter’s suggestion.</p>
      <p>Mack says that they are looking to expand in the future, possibly finding a location on a lower level on Main Street.</p>
      <p>“We want to be bigger and offer more services,” she said, further thanking the community for its support.</p>
