      <p>London - <b>Scotland</b> manager Steve Clarke said he had omitted <b>Kieran Tierney</b> from the squad for their final two <b>Euro 2020</b> group qualifiers because of a request from the full-back's club Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old underwent a double hernia operation in the summer.</p>
      <p>He eventually made his debut for Arsenal in the 5-0 thrashing of second tier Nottingham Forest in the League Cup on September 24.</p>
      <p>A couple of Europa League matches followed and he has played in their last four games.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal asked us not to select him (Tierney)," Clarke said.</p>
      <p>"Kieran has an ongoing issue that Arsenal are keen to address in the next international break.</p>
      <p>"It's a little bit frustrating. It's obviously frustrating for Kieran as well, but we've got good cover in that position."</p>
      <p>Clarke would not be drawn on what the issue was.</p>
      <p>"That's a question for Arsenal."</p>
      <p>Tierney will miss two effectively dead rubbers - Cyprus away on 16 November then Kazakhstan at home three days later - as Scotland cannot qualify from Group I.</p>
      <p>Clarke's side can still reach the finals via the play-offs in the spring, and he has made finishing third in the group a "minimum requirement", with Cyprus a point above his side.</p>
