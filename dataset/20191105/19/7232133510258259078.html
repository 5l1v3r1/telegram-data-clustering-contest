      <p>The cryptocurrency market is currently undecided on if <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> is about to embark on its next bull run, or if it’ll fall back further into a bearish trend in the short-term.</p>
      <p>The neutral market could finally have its decision, if a “life-changing” golden cross occurs in Bitcoin price charts, according to one crypto trader and analyst.</p>
      <h3>Golden Cross Forming on Weekly Bitcoin Charts</h3>
      <p>During the second quarter of 2019, the market was convinced that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> had begun its next bull run, and would soon reach <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/03/01/crypto-bitcoin-price-long-term/">price projections of $100,000 per BTC and higher</a> in the coming years as the bull market comes to a peak.</p>

      <p>But a fall from a triangle at the top of the early 2019 rally caused market sentiment to turn bearish, with many fearing that Bitcoin’s bear market isn’t actually over.</p>
      <p>However, an important <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldencross.asp">golden cross</a> is close to happening on Bitcoin weekly price charts, and if it occurs, it could “change your life,” according to one crypto trader and analyst.</p>

      <p>In a chart shared by the analyst, a black box depicts where the golden cross is about to occur, along with a comparison demonstrating the powerful rise following the last time such a life-changing golden cross played out.</p>
      <p>The golden cross is of the 100-week and 50-week moving averages – two important long-term moving averages that often signal to investors that a trend has legs.</p>
      <h3>Life-Changing Money: 3,900% ROI Following Last Cross on Weekly</h3>
      <p>The last time a golden cross of the 100-week and 50-week moving averages happened, was back in mid-2016, just before <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> really began to skyrocket and a bubble formed.</p>
      <p>Back then the price of Bitcoin was roughly $500 per BTC, and the golden cross kicked off a powerful rally that took the price of the asset to an all-time high price of $20,000 per BTC at its peak.</p>
      <p>It’s incredible to think that even a $500 investment could turn into $20,000, but that’s the power of Bitcoin. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/04/24/tech-stocks-gold-oil-bitcoin/">No other asset has ever performed as strongly</a> and offered such enormous “life-changing” returns for investors. The entire move represents a 3,900% ROI – a number that’s unheard of in other asset classes over an entire lifetime of an investment, let alone the year or two it took Bitcoin to reach such astronomical returns.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If Bitcoin rises another 3,900% from the golden cross that is about to happen, it would take the price of Bitcoin from today’s prices at $9,250 to $370,000 per BTC – and there’s no denying that is life-changing money, especially if an investor holds more than one BTC.</p>
