      <h1>Chris Evans Prefers Thor’s Hammer to Captain America’s Shield</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:58:55+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>While it’s been a few months since <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a>’s release, there are many moments that still stick with fans — like Captain America finally wielding the power of Mjolnir.</p>
      <p>Chris Evans actually had something to say about that moment when he recently stopped by <b>The Tonight Show</b>. Evans admitted he likes Thor’s hammer more than Cap’s shield. When Fallon asked about which of the two Evans preferred, he answered quickly: “Hammer.”</p>
      <p>“Well, you know, the shield was destined for the character,” explained Evans. “The hammer was kind of this period at the end of a sentence in terms of his worth, and it was nice. And the (film directors Joe and Anthony) Russos really know how to build those moments. I’ll say the hammer.” </p>

      <p>Evans also shared another humorous story about how he spoiled a key moment for co-star Anthony Mackie.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know he didn’t know what was going to happen,” said Evans, regarding the passing of Cap’s shield. “And I said, ‘Hey, man, isn’t that scene fantastic?’ He was like, ‘What scene?’ I said, ‘The scene where I give you the shield.’ He said, ‘You’re giving me the shield?!’ And I said, ‘Oh, no!’” </p>
      <p><b>Avengers: Endgame </b>is available now on 4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, DVD and digital formats.</p>
