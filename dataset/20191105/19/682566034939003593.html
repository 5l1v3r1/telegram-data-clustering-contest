      <p>London - Spectators will be hoping for a mini repeat of this year's epic Wimbledon final between <b>Novak Djokovic</b> and <b>Roger Federer</b> after the two tennis legends were drawn in the same group for next week's climax to the season, the <b>ATP Finals</b>.</p>
      <p>Djokovic, who could finish the week as world No 1, and Federer fought out a thrilling five set final at Wimbledon with the Serbian coming from a break down in the final set to win it 7-6 (7/5), 1-6, 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 13-12 (7/3) in what was at four hours and 57 minutes the longest final in the tournament's history.</p>
      <p>Their group clash in London will only be the best of three sets - Austria's two-time French Open finalist Dominic Thiem and Italian Matteo Berrettini make up the quartet.</p>
      <p>World No 1 Rafael Nadal is in a group with this year's US Open finalist Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece and Germany's Alexander Zverev.</p>
      <p>Nadal declared himself fit for the finals on Tuesday after he pulled out of last week's Paris Masters semi-finals - a scan revealed a "slight strain to the left abdominal".</p>
      <p>Nadal had still replaced Djokovic - who won the Paris Masters - as world No 1 but the Serbian can reclaim it.</p>
      <p>Djokovic will take top spot if he wins two group-stage matches and reaches the final and if the 33-year-old Spaniard - who has yet to win the finals - does not play or fails to win a round-robin match.</p>
      <p>Djokovic will also finish the year as No 1 if he wins the tournament and Nadal does not reach the semi-finals.</p>
