      <h1>Pixel 4 90Hz display: Here’s how much of a difference November’s update makes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:33:48+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>One of the most exciting features of the Pixel 4 was its 90Hz display, but Google made the decision to limit that higher refresh rate in many scenarios. Now, an <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/first-pixel-4-update/">update is promising to expand</a> how often your Pixel 4 uses its 90Hz display, and we’ve got some numbers to compare to see if it really made a difference.</p>
      <p>Rewinding a little bit, it was discovered not long after the Pixel 4 was announced that Google limits the 90Hz refresh rate not just in certain apps, but <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/25/google-pixel-4-drops-90hz-lower-brightness/">also when the brightness is below 75%</a>. Backlash followed, and Google promised that a future update would solve the problem and expand 90Hz to more settings.</p>
      <p>Alongside November’s security patch, Google is also pushing that 90Hz update to the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL. <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/pixel-4-90hz-update-reports/">Early reports have already confirmed</a> there’s a noticeable difference in how often 90Hz is active on the device, but we wanted to quantify exactly how much of a difference that is.</p>
      <p>To do that, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/04/pixel-4-90hz-update-reports/">we’re using an ADB command</a> that shows exactly how much time Pixel 4’s 90 Hz display is active between reboots. We’ve got three data points to look at as well.</p>
      <p>The first data point is my own. Before the November update, my Pixel 4 XL was using its 90 Hz refresh rate only 5% of the time. Specifically, it spent just a measly two hours at 90Hz over the course of 70 hours of uptime. How has that improved after the update? After roughly 24 hours, my Pixel 4 XL spent nearly three hours at 90Hz. That’s a <i>huge</i> difference.</p>
      <p>Using an ADB command, we did the math that shows the device was at 90Hz for 5% of its total uptime previously, but after the update, 37% of the time. That’s an encouraging total, but the results are going to vary from user to user.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Summerson">Cameron Summerson</a>, editor-in-chief of <i><a href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/">Review Geek</a></i>, was kind enough to share his numbers with me before updating to the November patch. In his case, his Pixel 4 XL was at 90Hz for just 42 minutes before the update — roughly 5% of the total uptime time, just like my own device. In his case, though, the first 24 hours only saw a jump to about 16% of the total uptime. His device spent a little over two hours at 90Hz.</p>
      <p>Finally, let’s look at a much less common scenario in our own Abner Li. Abner <i>locks</i> his Pixel to 50% brightness (or lower) at all times, well below the 75% threshold. Before the November update, Abner’s device never activated the 90Hz refresh rate but after, it actually did turn on while on the same settings. Specifically, about 20% of his usage time. Notably, Abner’s device is the smaller Pixel 4 which means its brightness level <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/november-update-makes-90hz-smooth-display-behave-differently-pixel-4-pixel-4-xl/">still affects</a> the refresh rate.</p>

      <p>What’s the conclusion? Google’s changes in the November update for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL makes a pretty big difference in how often 90 Hz is used. For the Pixel 4 XL specifically, the 90Hz refresh was used pretty much at all times. The specific figures here might not be exactly the same for all users, but it’s clear Google’s changes have made a significant difference. How will that affect battery life? That remains to be seen…</p>
