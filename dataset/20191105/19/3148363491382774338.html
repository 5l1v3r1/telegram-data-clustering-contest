      <p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFUNxRhVPAg">video</a> of the incident showed that the man stepped the wrong way on the yellow safety strip as the subway car approached.</p>
      <p>KPIX <a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/11/04/hero-worker-who-saved-fallen-man-from-approaching-bart-train-to-speak-to-reporters/">reported</a> that the incident took place at 5:20 p.m. on Sunday at the BART Coliseum station when BART Transportation Supervisor John O’Connor was working that evening to help with crowd control after the Oakland Raiders game.</p>
      <p>As the train zoomed by, O’Connor grabbed the man using his shoulders and yanked him back up onto the platform, according to the video.</p>

      <p>“He was sitting right there and he put his hand out and that’s when I gave him a hug. I’m like, Dude, you almost didn’t make it,” O’Connor told KPIX.</p>
      <p>O’Connor told reporters at a press conference Monday that he was “thankful” to be put in a position where he could save the man’s life.</p>
      <p>“I was fortunate that God put me there and he go to see another day. When I spoke to him later, I told him, ‘Hey, pay it forward,’” said O’Connor. “There was really no time to make a decision. I just looked, and it just happened. You know, when you look at police, fire, military, we’ve got heroes on a daily basis. It really feels awkward to be called a hero.”</p>
