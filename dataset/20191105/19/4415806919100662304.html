      <h1>Dundalk CEO to step down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T19:12:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/liam-mackey/" target="_blank">By Liam Mackey</a></address>
      <p>Dundalk have announced that Chief Executive Mark Devlin is to step down from his role.</p>
      <p>The former Brentford CEO, who joined the club in succession to Mal Brannigan in April, will leave Oriel Park in mid-November to return to the UK.</p>
      <p>“I may only have been here a relatively short period of time, but I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience and time in Dundalk,” said Devlin.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been fortunate to meet many fans and the passion they have for their club is clear to see. The club is fortunate to also have a very dedicated set of staff and volunteers and a playing squad which represents the club so well on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>“It has been a pleasure to work here and I wish the club every success in the future. However, family issues mean the time is right for me to return to the UK and seek a new challenge.”</p>
      <p>Dundalk chairman Mike Treacy said: “We would like to thank Mark for all of his efforts during his time at Dundalk. His experience in football has been invaluable and we wish him well for the future.”</p>
      <p>The news comes in the wake of the League and League Cup winners missing out on a treble with defeat to Shamrock Rovers in Sunday’s FAI Cup Final and just ahead of their season-concluding United The Union Champions Cup games against Linfield.</p>
