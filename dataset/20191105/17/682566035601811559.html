      <p>Milan -Â Italian club <b>Verona</b> were on Tuesday given a one-match partial stadium closure for monkey chants from their fans directed at <b>Brescia</b> forward <b>Mario Balotelli </b>during a Serie A game at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Italian international Balotelli scored in Sunday's 2-1 defeat but his performance was overshadowed by his fury at the racist abuse from a section of Verona's supporters.</p>
      <p>Serie A's disciplinary commission on Tuesday said the chants "were clearly perceived, in addition to the player, also by the federation representative positioned nearby."</p>
      <p>The commission found "after these cries... there were also cries of support followed by long applause".</p>
      <p>As a result they ordered that a section known as the "Poltrone Est" in the Bentegodi Stadium, which can host around 3,500 spectators in the 30,000-capacity ground, be closed for one match.</p>
      <p>Despite denials of abuse from Verona, a video published on Twitter by a fan showed a number of supporters directing abuse at Balotelli before the forward booted the ball at them in the stands.</p>
      <p>The match was suspended for a few minutes around the hour mark as Balotelli tried to force himself from the field before a message was read out on the stadium loudspeaker threatening that both teams would leave the field if there was a repeat of any abuse.</p>
      <p>The message was whistled loudly by a large number of the home fans.</p>
      <p>Verona coach Ivan Juric insisted he heard "no racists chants, nothing at all," adding that "to say otherwise is a lie".</p>
      <p>Earlier Verona announced they have banned Luca Castellini, the leader of their hard-core ultras supporters group, until June 2030 for saying Balotelli would never be "completely Italian".</p>
      <p>"Balotelli's Italian because he has Italian citizenship, but he can never be completely Italian," Castellini said in a radio interview on Monday.</p>
      <p>When asked if Verona fans were racist, Castellini added: "We have a negro in our team and he scored yesterday and all of Verona applauded."</p>
      <p>Verona barred Castellini from their stadium "based on considerations and expressions seriously contrary to those that distinguish the ethical principles and values of our club".</p>
      <p>Balotelli, 29, who was born in Palermo to Ghanaian parents but was raised just outside Brescia, had to be held back by players from both teams to stop him leaving the pitch.</p>
      <p>"Balotelli's a clown. He only heard it in his own head," continued Castellini.</p>
      <p>According to the Italian Ansa news agency, the Verona public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into Castellini's remarks for a potential crime of "incitement to racial hatred".</p>
      <p>A motion was also put forward to the Verona city council by four councillors calling for any footballer "defaming" the city to face legal action.</p>
      <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, whose side are in Italy to face Atalanta in the Champions League on Wednesday, expressed his support for ex-City striker Balotelli.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately these things happen a lot and often the innocent party is blamed," said Guardiola at a San Siro news conference.</p>
      <p>"I hope Mario Balotelli is not punished because sometimes strong steps are needed to make progress.</p>
      <p>"It is a problem throughout Europe and not only in Italy. We have to fight day after day, at home and in schools."</p>
      <p>Balotelli, who obtained Italian citizenship at the age of 18, has been capped 36 times for Italy.</p>
