      <h2>Angelo Alessio is coming to terms with the extended loss of his star centre-back Findlay due to a hamstring tendon injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:15:59+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Lochlin Highet, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/lochlin-highet/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/angelo-alessio">Angelo Alessio</a> could be without Stuart Findlay for up to three months, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-news">Kilmarnock Standard</a> can exclusively reveal.</p>
      <p>The Italian boss has been facing a defensive crisis as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> headed to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> with all four centre-backs unavailable.</p>
      <p>He hopes to have Dario Del Fabro back along with Alex Bruce who has completed his suspension, Connor Johnson is unlikely to be fit due to a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Injured midfielder Mohamed El Makrini should be available for selection as he returned to training on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But now the gaffer is coming to terms with the extended loss of his star centre-back Findlay due to a hamstring tendon injury.</p>
      <p>He told the Standard: “Stuart’s is a bad injury, he will be out for a long time.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I don’t expect to have him available before Christmas or the New Year, it’s a serious injury.</p>
      <p>“I think he will be out for two or three months.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I was disappointed with the result against Aberdeen, we will be working on the mistakes in training.</p>
      <p>“It was tough without and natural centre-backs, but we will address it anyway so that it doesn’t happen again.</p>
      <p>“I hope to have two of my centre-backs available, Bruce will be back and I hope that Del Fabro will too.</p>

      <p>“Connor Johnson probably won’t be available as his knee injury has stopped him from training. He will have a scan this week.</p>
      <p>Alessio is getting his side prepared for a clash against Hamilton as he hopes to avenge their league defeat earlier this season.</p>
      <p>The Lanarkshire side ran out 2-0 victors on the second day of the season, before Killie knocked them out of the Betfred Cup a week later.</p>
      <p>But Alessio won’t be taking Brian Rice’s men lightly.</p>
      <p>He said: “I always say it, but these games are tough, it’s true.</p>

      <p>“Hamilton are a good team, they are compact and they have already beat us.</p>
      <p>“We know their style and I expect a hard game, especially when we have players unavailable.</p>
      <p>“We are working hard to make sure we are ready to get the win on Saturday.”</p>
