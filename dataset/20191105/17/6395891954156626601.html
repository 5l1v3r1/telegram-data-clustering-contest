      <p>Jordan's aunt, Taaka Jordan, posted photos on Facebook of Smith walking over to Ty Jordan, embracing him, and then kneeling in prayer with his opponent. The post was shared more than 159,000 times before the it was removed from public display late Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Smith said he knew Ty Jordan because both players competed on a select 7-on-7 team, <a href="https://www.kxii.com/content/news/Sherman-football-player-prays-with-opponent-564323201.html">KXII </a>reported.</p>
      <p>"I just had a moment with him praying over him, his mom, and his family," Smith told the television station reported.</p>
      <p>Sherman football coach J.D. Martinez called Smith "a true leader" on and off the field.</p>
      <p>"He has compassion, and it followed through for a lot of the guys on the team," Martinez told <a href="https://www.kxii.com/content/news/Sherman-football-player-prays-with-opponent-564323201.html">KXII.</a></p>
      <p>"To see that it (photograph) blew up I was very surprised by it, and I wasn't expecting it to be like that,,you know," Smith told the television station, "I was just doing it for him and doing it for his mom and his family."</p>
      <p>Martinez said his wife snapped the viral photographs and sent them to Smith's mother, who in turn passed them along to Jordan's family, <a href="https://www.kxii.com/content/news/Sherman-football-player-prays-with-opponent-564323201.html">KXII</a> reported.</p>
      <p>"It's pretty special that kind of everybody gets to see really what he is. He's that type of kid all the time, it's just not in front of the cameras or anything like that, he's like that every day," Martinez told the television station.</p>
      <p>"Football brings people together in so many different ways, and that was just one example of it that night," Smith told <a href="https://www.kxii.com/content/news/Sherman-football-player-prays-with-opponent-564323201.html">KXII.</a></p>
