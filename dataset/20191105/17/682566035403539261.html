      <p>Cape Town - Former Olympic gold medalist <b>Ryk Neethling</b> believes the South African swimming team will win medals at next year's <b>Tokyo Olympics</b>.</p>
      <p>At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Team SA took home three silver medals.</p>
      <p>In a blow to their medal chances, Cameron van der Burgh announced his retirement from competitive swimming in 2018.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, SA's most decorated swimmer, Chad le Clos, will compete in his third Olympics in 2020.</p>
      <p>SA's newest swimming star Tatjana Schoenmaker is one of the country's strongest medal contenders in Tokyo after winning gold at this year's Commonwealth Games in the 200m breaststroke.</p>
      <p>Neethling, who won gold at the 2004 Athens Games in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay, expressed his excitement at South Africa's female swimming prospects.</p>
      <p>"Yes, it's very exciting, I think our female swimmers haven't really been tested on the very intense international stage but someone like Tatjana (Schoenmaker) has been doing really well," said Neethling at the <i>Night with Ronan Keating</i> charity event at Val de vie Estate this past weekend.</p>
      <p>"Obviously Chad (le Clos) is the old experienced guy now, it's hard to believe that he has come so far from those days in 2012, but I definitely think we'll leave Tokyo with a couple of medals."</p>
      <p>The 2020 Tokyo Olympics is scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9.</p>
