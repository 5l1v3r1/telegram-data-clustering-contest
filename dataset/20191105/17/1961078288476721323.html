      <p>We invite our readers to try new forms of expressing your opinion beyond the usual letter format. How about a limerick or haiku? Or change the lyrics of a song or words of a nursery rhyme? Channel your inner Dr. Seuss?</p>
      <p>We’d like you to weigh in on any aspect of current affairs: the Democratic race, Congress, international relations, the economy, climate change, etc. And please, we implore you, consider topics that go beyond, you know, our president.</p>
