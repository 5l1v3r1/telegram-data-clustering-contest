      <p>LONDON (Nov 5): Germany's 20-year bond yield rose into positive territory on Tuesday for the first time since July, tracking moves on debt markets across the developed world on optimism around U.S.-China trade talks and robust U.S. service sector data.</p>
      <p>China is pushing U.S. President Donald Trump to remove more tariffs imposed in September, according to overnight reports, while Beijing and Washington spoke of progress in the talks.</p>
      <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross meanwhile, said licences for U.S. companies to sell components to China's telecoms giant Huawei will come "very shortly”.</p>
      <p>Investors reacted positively — rushing into stock markets, boosting China's offshore yuan to a three-month high against the dollar and dumping safe-haven bonds.</p>
      <p>This was followed by data from the U.S. services sector, which came in higher than consensus.</p>
      <p>Across the euro area, most 10-year bond yields climbed around 3 basis points to their highest levels since mid-July.</p>
      <p>Germany's 20-year bond yield rose to 0.001%, before falling back to -0.02%.</p>
      <p>The yield has risen 40 bps since early-September in line with a significant upward move in yields across the euro zone in this period. Germany's 30-year bond yield rose into positive territory in October.</p>
      <p>Next in line is the French 10-year bond, which is hovering close to a return to positive territory, after rising as high as -0.006%.</p>
      <p>"Since last week positive headlines on China-U.S. trade, markets has supported this sell-off as well as a steepening of global rates across the board," said TD Securities rates strategist Pooja Kumra.</p>
      <p>"Today's stronger data in US as well as the spring of issuance is also adding to the steepening pressure."</p>
      <p>In a sign that hopes for progress in U.S./China trade talks have boosted optimism about the global growth outlook, a key gauge of long-term euro zone inflation expectations rose above 1.25% to its highest in more than six weeks.</p>
      <p>"People are trading the trade headlines like the sunny side up — they are tending to see the positive side," said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed income strategist at Rabobank in London.</p>
      <p>Analysts said fresh bond supply from the United States and Europe added to upward pressure on yields. Austria sold almost one billion euros of five and 10-year bonds.</p>
      <p>Spain, which holds an election on Sunday, also moved into focus.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the main candidates to become Spain's next prime minister clashed over how to handle Catalan separatism, as they tried to woo voters ahead of a repeat election that opinion polls show could be as inconclusive as the one in April.</p>
      <p>The closely-watched gap between Spanish and German 10-year bond yields on Monday widened to around 67 bps, its highest level since mid-October — suggesting some unease among investors as Sunday's election draws closer.</p>
      <p>"An election should add uncertainty as to the future trajectory, in turn pushing forward spreads wider," analysts at Mizuho said in a note.</p>
      <p>But other peripheral sovereigns outperformed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The gap between Irish and German 10-year bond yields fell to its tightest level since April 2018 at 36 bps, while the gap with Portugal is at its lowest level since December 2009, at 55 bps.</p>
