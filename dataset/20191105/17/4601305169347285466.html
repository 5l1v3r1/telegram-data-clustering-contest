      <h1>One ton boulder mysteriously missing from Arizona forest has mysteriously returned</h1>

      <p>Last month, the "Wizard Rock," an iconic 1-ton boulder, mysteriously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/wizard-rock-1-ton-stolen-trnd/index.html">vanished</a> without a trace from Arizona's Prescott National Forest. It was the third boulder disappearance in the region over the last few months. Now, Prescott National Forest officials report that the Wizard Rock has mysteriously returned. From <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/wizard-rock-returned-trnd/index.html">CNN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The slab of black rock with streaks of white quartz holds special meaning to local geology enthusiasts, forest officials said. It's greeted passing motorists along scenic Highway 89 for years and makes for a strong selfie setting.<br/><br/>Its disappearance confounded rangers. The stunning chunk of stone weighs about the same as a small car, so discreetly lifting it would've required some extreme effort.</blockquote>
      <p>Seems to me they should check with the local interdimensional Bigfoot.</p>
