      <p>With <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/red-dead-redemption-2/39461"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></a> now available on Windows PC, graphics card manufacturer Nvidia has announced its <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fred-dead-redemption-2-pc-nvidia-recommended-gpus%2F&amp;referrer=polygon.com">guidance for hitting 4K at 60 frames per second</a>. Turns out that even its most expensive consumer-level GPU, <a href="https://amzn.to/33jHOHh">the roughly $1,200 GeForce RTX 2080 Ti</a>, can’t get there at the highest settings. That means there’s plenty of headroom for driver optimizations, and/or the next generation of GPUs.</p>
      <p>Those lucky folks who aren’t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20949555/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-crash">dealing with crashes</a> are already <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/5/20949510/red-dead-redemption-mod-pc-release-nov-11-joker-shaders-mods">off and running</a>, and most seem pleased with the results. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20942406/red-dead-redemption-2-rdr2-pc-impressions">We certainly were</a> during our controlled 4K60 demo last month. But, as it turns out, we weren’t actually playing at the highest settings. <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fred-dead-redemption-2-pc-nvidia-recommended-gpus%2F&amp;referrer=polygon.com">As Nvidia revealed in its blog post</a>, the press was working with a mix of medium and high settings at 4K.</p>

      <p>If you’re dead-set on goosing all the bells and whistles, Nvidia rendering at a lower resolution, either 3264x1836 or 2880x1620, and upscaling to 4K for “a sizeable performance improvement, and only a minimal reduction in image clarity.” Coupled with the company’s new <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fgeforce-gtx-16-series-super-game-ready-driver%2F&amp;referrer=polygon.com">latency and sharpening tech</a>, it sounds like a decent solution. At the very least, be sure to update your drivers, as Nvidia thoughtfully dropped a day-zero patch on Monday.</p>
