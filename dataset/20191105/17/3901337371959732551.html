      <p>Mane was left furious during the Reds' match against Burnley earlier in the campaign, and erupted on the touchline following his substitution.</p>
      <p>However, the duo have long settled the incident, and he says they have a great relationship, even though they do not always agree on things.</p>
      <p>"He's a crazy goalscorer and an exceptional player who can do everything," Mane told <i>France Football</i>.</p>
      <p>"We have sometimes had our disagreements, but it remains a great pleasure to play besides him because I have the feeling we speak the same type of football."</p>

      <p>The 27-year-old also spoke about Jurgen Klopp's relationship with his players, saying the German tactician is like a father to him.</p>
      <p>"His secret, I think, is to be the team's dad. Between us, everything clicked straight away," Mane added</p>
      <p>"We all love him like a father and we fear him like one too.</p>
      <p>"He takes up a lot of space in my life, and not just in football. He's great as a person.</p>
      <p>"I trust him blindly, like most of the dressing room, I think."</p>
