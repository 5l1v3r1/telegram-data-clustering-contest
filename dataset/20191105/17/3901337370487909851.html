      <p>Another trophy slipped away from the Buccaneers, who suffered a penalty shoot-out loss to Soweto rivals Kaizer Chiefs in the quarter-finals over the weekend.</p>
      <p>In the league though, Pirates will be aiming for back-to-back victories for the first time this season after they defeated Highlands Park 1-0 seven days ago in Tembisa.</p>
      <p>Rhulani Mokwena is forced in to a change for tonight's encounter as Thembinkosi Lorch will be suspended after picking up his fourth yellow card of the season against Chiefs on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pirates will be coming up against a Maritzburg outfit in superb form as the penalty shoot-out triumph over Highlands Park in the Telkom Knockout extended their winning run to five matches in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Maritzburg's league form has certainly picked up after a slow start, as they have won their last three matches without a conceding a goal.</p>
      <p>The last time these two sides met, the Buccaneers walked away with a 1-0 victory at the Harry Gwala Stadium.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
