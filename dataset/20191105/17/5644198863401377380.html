      <p>SINGAPORE: A man was sentenced to three years' jail on Tuesday (Nov 5) for setting a fire at a void deck that spread, prompting an evacuation.</p>
      <p>The blaze, which he started with a lighter, "seriously damaged" the block and led to repairs that cost about S$33,000.</p>

      <p>Jamil Kamis, 63, was found guilty of one count of mischief by fire after a trial.</p>
      <p>He had been smoking at Block 14A Lorong 7 Toa Payoh in the early morning of Jun 20, 2017, when he set alight a mattress that was placed among some discarded items.</p>
      <p>About 50 people were evacuated from the second to sixth floors, and one woman was taken to hospital for smoke inhalation.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Based on closed-circuit television footage, Jamil was the only one at the scene moments before the fire began.</p>
      <p>Knowing that he had sparked it, he ran back up to his flat when he saw Singapore Civil Defence Force officers battling the flames. </p>
      <p>He denied being at the block or knowing about the fire when confronted by police.</p>
      <p>When interviewed by the police, he first said he was at home, and admitted to smoking at the block only when shown CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Jotham Tay asked for at least three years' jail based on similar cases. </p>
      <p>He pointed out Jamil's list of previous convictions starting with theft from when he was a teenager, with the heftiest jail term meted out for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.</p>
      <p>The defence highlighted that Jamil lives in a two-room rental flat and suffers from several health issues including diabetes, a heart condition and kidney problems.</p>
      <p>The judge agreed with the prosecution, and the defence said her client intends to appeal against conviction and sentence.</p>
      <p>He granted Jamil bail pending appeal.</p>
      <p>For mischief by fire, he could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined.</p>
