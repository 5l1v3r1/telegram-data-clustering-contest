      <h1>Head-on crash in South Africa kills Edmonton family of four</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:49:00+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Lawrence, CTV News Edmonton</a></address>
      <p>A family of four from Edmonton was killed in a car crash in South Africa while on a missionary trip, according to family friends.</p>
      <p>Melissa and Brendan Perrott, their children Evelyn, 5, and Colton, 3, were killed in a head-on crash near Bulembu, Swaziland on Nov. 3, says a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/in-remembrance-of-the-perrott-family">GoFundMe campaign</a> titled "In Remembrance of the Perrott Family."</p>
      <p>A fifth person in the vehicle, Sabelo Sibeko, was also killed in the crash, as were four people in the vehicle they collided with, <a href="http://www.times.co.sz/news/125895-family-of-5-killed-in-sa-car-crash.html">according to local newspaper the Times of Swaziland.</a> It reportedly occurred between the towns of Harrismith and Qwaqwa in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Global Affairs Canada said it was aware of the deaths in a statement provided to CTV News.</p>
      <p>"Consular officials are in contact with the family in Canada and are providing consular assistance," a spokesperson said. Officials are also in contact with local authorities to find out what happened. </p>
      <p>Family friends say the Perrotts were volunteering with <a href="https://www.bulembu.org/">Bulembu Ministries</a> in Swaziland.</p>
      <p>The non-profit group's website says it provides care for some 350 orphans and vulnerable kids in Swaziland and operates Bulembu Christian Academy.</p>
      <p>The group Church Family, which organized the GoFundMe campaign, posted a letter written by the family prior to them embarking for Africa in 2017.</p>
      <p>"Our Lord has had us on an emotional journey of surrendering control and letting go of so much of what we have placed our 'identity' in," it reads.</p>
      <p>"From simple things like vehicles, furniture, horses and toys, to more complicated things like our jobs, our home, our small group, our church and our community. It has been a process of being stripped away from the things that we thought made us who we are."</p>
      <p>A family friend told CTV News Edmonton that the Perrotts impacted "so many people's lives" during their time with Bulembu Ministries, which they said is "devastated" over the deaths.</p>
      <p>The fundraising campaign was launched to help relatives cover the costs of traveling to Africa and transporting the family's bodies and personal items home, as well as funeral costs.</p>
      <p>It had raised over $19,000 as of Monday at noon, shattering its $5,000 goal.</p>
