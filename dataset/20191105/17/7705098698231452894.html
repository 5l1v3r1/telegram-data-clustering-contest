      <h1>Hailee Steinfeld May Not Play Hawkeye’s Kate Bishop After All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:21:28+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>It seems that the wait to know who will portray Kate Bishop in <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/hawkeye"><b>Hawkeye</b></a> is far from being over. In the last few weeks, <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/bumblebee">Bumblebee</a> </b>star <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/465455-hailee-steinfeld-might-be-joining-marvels-hawkeye-series">Hailee Steinfeld has been reportedly attached</a> to the character who will inherit the title character’s mantle from Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton. Speaking with <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-11-02/hailee-steinfeld-hawkeye-cast-disney/">RadioTimes.com</a>, though, Steinfeld has cast some doubts on her future involvement in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
      <p>“That’s not something that’s necessarily happening,” Steinfeld said. “We’re going to wait and find out, I guess.”</p>

      <p>Steinfeld will next appear as poet Emily Dickinson in an Apple TV+ series. Her role in <b>Dickinson</b> could leave her unable to take on another big TV role, though. According to Radio Times, Marvel is still negotiating with Steinfeld’s team to have her on board.</p>
      <p>Should they seal the deal, this will hardly be Steinfeld’s first foray into the comic-book movie universe. She recently lent her voice to 2018’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse"><b>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</b></a> as Gwen Stacy, and she will likely reprise her role in the film’s upcoming sequel.</p>
      <p>The <b>Hawkeye</b> series will see Jeremy Renner reprising his role as Clint Barton. Additionally, the story will introduce his protege Kate Bishop as a possible successor. Disney is developing multiple limited series featuring characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier"><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b></a>, <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/loki"><b>Loki</b></a> and <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/wandavision"><b>WandaVision</b></a> being three of the shows in development at the moment. Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen will reprise their roles for their respective series as well.</p>
      <p><b>Hawkeye</b> is currently targeting a Fall 2021 premiere date. Would you like to see Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop on Marvel’s <b>Hawkeye</b> series? Let us know in the comment section below!</p>
