      <h1>Uber Reports $1.16 Billion Quarterly Loss, Shares Plummet | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>Shares of Uber Technologies Inc. plummeted in after-hours trading Monday and into Tuesday after the ridesharing company reported that it lost a whopping $1.16 billion in the third quarter, exceeding losses from the same quarter last year by 18 percent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:49:45+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author">David Ng</a></address>
      <p>For the quarter, Uber reported a loss per share and revenue that beat analyst expectations, but the company’s worsening prospects for eventual profitability sent the stock to a near-record low since Uber went public in May.</p>
      <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/04/uber-uber-q3-2019-earnings.html">interview</a> with CNBC that he is looking to right the ship in two years’ time.</p>
      <p>“We know there is the expectation of profitability, and we expect to deliver for 2021,” Khosrowshahi told the cable network.</p>
      <p>Uber shares are facing more downward pressure on multiple fronts, including the end of the employee lock-up period next week, which will allow Uber employees to sell their shares.</p>
      <p>The company is also facing a significant legal battle in California over the recent passage of a law, <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/09/11/california-senate-passes-gig-employment-bill-that-could-threaten-uber-lyft/">formerly known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB5)</a>, that would entitle gig economy workers to perks, including minimum wage and overtime.</p>
      <p>The law represents an existential threat to Uber’s business model, which relies on drivers being classified as contract workers.</p>
      <p>Uber, Lyft and other ridesharing and food delivery companies <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/30/uber-lyft-unveil-ballot-measure-to-fight-california-gig-workers-law/">have promised to spend</a> $90 million to combat the law.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Uber <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/10/18/uber-lays-off-400-u-s-employees-imports-hundreds-of-foreign-workers/">laid of 400 employees</a> at its California offices while seeking to import hundreds of foreign workers through the H-1B visa program.</p>
      <p>Uber’s Khosrowshahi said in an <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/11/04/uber-technologies-inc-uber-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx">analyst call</a> Monday that he is realigning the company’s priorities.</p>
      <p>“This company grew very fast… And so there wasn’t a lot of focus on how do you make sure that you work efficiently,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It was absolutely the right set of priorities for the time. Our priorities are changing.”</p>
      <p>Shares of Uber were down nearly 8 percent in Tuesday morning trading.</p>
