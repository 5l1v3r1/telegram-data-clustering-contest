      <p>PHNOM PENH: Cambodia has deployed troops and held live firing drills in preparation for the possible return of an opposition leader who is an arch-rival of the country's strongman premier.</p>
      <p>Sam Rainsy, who has lived in France since 2015 to avoid jail for convictions he says are politically motivated, has promised a dramatic return on Nov 9, Cambodia's Independence Day.</p>

      <p>But Prime Minister Hun Sen has warned Rainsy will be arrested on sight and police have rounded up dozens of opposition activists in advance.</p>
      <p>Defence Minister Tea Banh told reporters Monday night (Nov 4) that troops are in place at the Thai-Cambodian border.</p>
      <p>"We consider this a coup attempt," Tea Banh said.</p>
      <p>Firing exercises with live rounds were held in border provinces, a government spokesman told AFP Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But Rainsy doubled down on the homecoming in a video released on Tuesday, and called for Cambodians to be "united to remove the traitor Hun Sen".</p>
      <p>Observers are not convinced Rainsy will attempt the return without Hun Sen's sign-off, as he has done in the past.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen, who has ruled for 34 years, has widened his grip on power after an election last year in which his ruling party swept all seats.</p>
      <p>The poll, widely derided as a sham, was held after Cambodia's Supreme Court dissolved the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party and arrested one of its co-founders.</p>
