      <h2>Fears for future of 79 stores and 2,500 employees as chairman says brand is 'far from immune' to the headwinds that are battering the high street</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:45:19+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">David Bentley, https://www.facebook.com/davidbentleybm/</a></address>
      <p>Mothercare UK has confirmed the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as administrators, raising fears over the future of its 79 stores and 2,500 employees.</p>
      <p>It said that having taken insolvency and legal advice, the board has "decided that there was no reasonable alternative but to appoint administrators".</p>
      <p>Clive Whiley, chairman of Mothercare, said: "It is with deep regret and sadness that we have been unable to avoid the administration of Mothercare UK and Mothercare Business Services, and we fully understand the significant impact on those UK colleagues and business partners who are affected.</p>

      <p>"However, the board concluded that the administration processes serve the wider interests of ensuring a sustainable future for the company, including the wider group's global colleagues, its pension fund, lenders and other stakeholders."</p>
      <p>He added: "Despite the changes implemented over the last 18 months contributing to a significant reduction in net debt over the same period, Mothercare UK continues to consume cash on an unsustainable basis.</p>
      <p>"The action announced today has been carefully thought through and without it, the existence of the wider group would be threatened."</p>
      <p>The chairman blamed high levels of rent and rates and a continuing shift in consumer behaviour from high street to online.</p>
      <p>He said the high street was facing a "near existential problem" with intensifying pressures and Mothercare UK was far from immune to these headwinds despite the strength of the brand.</p>
