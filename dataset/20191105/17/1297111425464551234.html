      <p>A veteran Regina police officer is on the mend and eager to return to work after being repeatedly stabbed on the weekend in a downtown parkade, while the man accused of wielding the knife remains in custody on an attempted murder charge.</p>
      <p>Cpl. Justin Duck was rushed to hospital on Sunday with multiple stab wounds, including a serious injury to his lower body that came very close to hitting an artery. Duck was attempting to arrest a man during a call to investigate a report of a stolen vehicle.</p>
      <p>“There was a fair bit of blood loss at the scene, and of course our officers were very worried for his safety,” Chief Evan Bray told a news conference Monday.</p>
      <p>Bray said Duck is still feeling sore, but is doing OK after being “stitched up” and sent home to recuperate.</p>
      <p>“This is an officer who’s a very experienced police officer, 17 years of service, worked frontline uniform patrol. He’s done a lot of investigative work in our police service, and so he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to him and to his team. I think that that speaks to the worry and concern and the compassion that his teammates are showing towards him as well,” said Bray.</p>
      <p>While Bray indicated Duck wants to get back on duty as soon as possible, the officer won’t return until police have ensured he is physically and mentally ready. He expected Duck could be back at the Regina Police Service (RPS) in as little as a month.</p>
      <p>Jordan Stirling, 29, has been charged with attempted murder, possession of a weapon (knife) dangerous to public peace, theft of auto, possession of property (vehicle) obtained by crime under $5,000 and breach of undertaking.</p>
      <p>He made his first appearance at Regina Provincial Court on Monday afternoon on a swath of charges, many pre-dating the Sunday allegations. Among his other charges are fraud, possession of stolen property, possession of a drug, mischief and breaches. Stirling is also charged with several unrelated weapons offences, alleging he possessed knives, bear spray and ammunition for a .22-calibre firearm and a 12-gauge shotgun.</p>
      <p>The previous charges span a range of dates between July 23 and Oct. 2, with the next set of alleged offences being the stabbing incident. Court heard he was the subject of a bench warrant, having failed to appear in court on the October date.</p>
      <p>Stirling seemed confused when the Crown opposed his release from custody.</p>
      <p>“I recently got a new job doing roofing,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But you’ve got to understand, this is a serious charge,” Judge James Rybchuk explained.</p>
      <p>Stirling persisted, telling the judge he was “trying to stay away from drugs” and looking to turn his life around.</p>
      <p>When he was unable to persuade anyone to release him, he asked to speak with a Legal Aid lawyer prior to his next appearance, set for Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>At about 3:45 p.m. Sunday, officers responded to a report of a stolen vehicle at a parkade on the 2100 block of Saskatchewan Drive. As officers confirmed the 2005 GMC Jimmy — which was parked and unoccupied — was indeed stolen, a man returned to it.</p>
      <p>Police said Duck challenged the man who had climbed into the driver’s seat, which is when the officer was allegedly attacked. Bray contended it was as if someone was trying to get away “at all costs”.</p>
      <p>Duck retreated, and was joined by two other officers. The suspect allegedly attempted to flee, at which point officers deployed a Taser, made an arrest, and administered emergency first aid treatment to Duck.</p>
      <p>EMS paramedics transported Duck to hospital, where staff stabilized him and determined his wounds were not life-threatening despite the severity of the attack.</p>
      <p>Bray commended the swift actions of the officers on scene who “kicked into gear,” rendering immediate aid to Duck and managing to safely apprehend a suspect.</p>
      <p>Later that night, the officers who rushed to help Duck visited him in the hospital, along with RPS senior members and Bray.</p>
      <p>Bray said the incident shows the unpredictability of policing.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t have to be the middle of the night in a dark alley,” he added. “Sometimes it can be something that appears to be just a very routine call for service that can escalate very quickly. And that’s what happened in this case.”</p>
      <p>Police have spoken with another male suspect, a youth who walked away from the scene. On Tuesday, RPS said the teen, whose age wasn’t released, had been charged in connection with the vehicle theft but not the attack on the officer.</p>
