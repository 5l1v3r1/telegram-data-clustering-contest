        <b>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has ordered officials to stop the same companies from winning government contracts repeatedly and allow new contractors to get jobs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>She issued the orders at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council or ECNEC on Tuesday weeks after a number of government work fell into limbo following the arrest of controversial contractor SM Golam Kibria Shamim.</p>
      <p>“The prime minister asked that to tender documents ne prepared in such a way so that any particular firm will not get work repeatedly and new contractors can get the contracts.</p>
      <p>The prime minster has ordered for creating opportunities for the new contractors to work,” Planning Minister MA Mannan said.</p>
      <p>GK Shamim allegedly won the contracts of the Public Works Department worth tens of billions of taka by influencing dishonest officials with his identity as a Jubo League leader.</p>
      <p>He was initially charged under illegal arms and drugs laws.</p>
      <p>GK Shamim’s firm GKB and Company Pvt Ltd has failed to complete 24 projects of the PWD in designated time, a bdnews24.com investigation has revealed recently.</p>
      <p>The planning minister said Hasina also ordered identification of the projects that have missed the deadline due to lack of workforce or other reasons.</p>
