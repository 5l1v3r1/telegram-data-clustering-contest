      <p>My weekend with the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA17718_00-NIOH2BETANA00000"><i>Nioh 2</i> beta</a> did not go as smoothly as I hoped it would, but I'm not giving up yet – it's not over until November 10. I don't know if I'll "get good" in time, but I'll settle for adequacy.</p>
      <p>If you're struggling to survive against that dang weasel, or the no-good snake, or any of the other monstrous threats staring you down in <i>Nioh 2</i>, I feel you. Here's enough inspiration for both of us: a complete beta boss rush cleared with Level 1 character stats and gear. No armor, no magic, no problem.</p>

      <p>"Some sloppy runs, but eh, I'm still getting used to the new stuff," said player <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=24&amp;v=gmzo0uBu6xc">Poto2222</a>.</p>
      <p>If anyone has a Hyperbolic Time Chamber they'd be willing to rent out, hit me up. Otherwise, I'll practice the hard way (and then try to use a bunch of cheap talismans to bring these bosses down).</p>
      <p>For many of us, this beta is a firm reminder that we're not as good at <i>Nioh </i>as we thought we were.</p>
