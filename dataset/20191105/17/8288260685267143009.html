      <p>Aston Villa’s Carabao Cup quarter-final with Liverpool will take place on Tuesday, December 17 (7.45pm).</p>
      <p>Uncertainty had surrounded the last-eight clash due to the Reds’ involvement in the club World Cup during December.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side play in the semi-final a day after the scheduled quarter-final against <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc?0">Villa,</a> and Liverpool today (Tuesday) confirmed their intention to play one team at Villa Park and another 24 hours later in Qatar.</p>
      <p>“As a result, we will be utilising two playing squads simultaneously, with one squad participating in the FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar and another in the Carabao Cup,” <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-liverpool-carabao-cup-17205750">a Liverpool statement read.</a></p>

      <p>Here’s what the Liverpool fans have made of the decision.</p>
      <p><b>@Luke_Chidlow4:</b> We’re definitely playing a youth team in the quarter final.</p>
      <p><b>@SamueILFC:</b> Can’t wait to beat Aston Villa with our under 18’s and Andy Lonergan.</p>
      <p><b>@LFCAaron_:</b> Joke.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>@rauidri:</b> Punished for being successful.</p>
      <p><b>@zerscna:</b> So we’re actually splitting the team wow.</p>
      <p><b>@socallfc:</b> Would be a great statement if we just withdraw lol.</p>
      <p><b>@ijc:</b> Laughable. Field an under 18's. Exactly the reason why no-one cares about this tin pot cup anymore. This is a joke.</p>
