      <p>(CNN) - First, let's take a moment to marvel over the tiny, wide-eyed wonder that former US Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson and her husband, Andrew East, just brought into the world.</p>
      <p>Awww!</p>
      <p>The couple announced the latest addition to their family through social media on Monday --- after months of pregnancy updates.</p>
      <p>"She's the best thing ever," Johnson said in an Instagram video. The gymnast said she was excited "to be home and to have the greatest little daughter ever."</p>
      <p>Johnson won four Olympic medals and also came out a winner in a season of "Dancing with the Stars." In 2012, she said she would be retiring because of recurring knee problems.</p>
      <p>The past few days of enjoying their daughter have been "heaven," East said.</p>
      <p>"We've just been cuddling and talking and having family time."</p>
      <p>The couple also teased they'll release a birth vlog for Baby East -- after the early cuddles are over.</p>
      <p>"We think the birth vlog will be live this week," Johnson said. "I was completely against birth vlogs until (we were) in the moment and I was like 'we need to capture this.'"</p>
      <p>The happy news comes about two years after Johnson announced she had a miscarriage only days after learning they were first expecting.</p>
      <p>In an Instagram post in October, she said: "2 years ago today our world was turned upside down when we lost our first pregnancy... 2 years later we were anxiously awaiting the arrival of our rainbow baby."</p>
