        <b>Everton midfielder Andre Gomes has been released from hospital after surgery to repair a fracture dislocation to his right ankle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gomes, 26, suffered the injury during <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50197735">Sunday's 1-1 Premier League draw</a> with Tottenham at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>The Portugal international will now continue his rehabilitation under the guidance of Everton's medical team.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50293214">A club statement</a> on Monday said that surgery "went extremely well" and Gomes is "expected to make a full recovery".</p>
      <p>The incident, which involved Tottenham forward Son Heung-min, initially looked innocuous, but the mood immediately changed among the players and crowd as the full extent of the injury became apparent.</p>
      <p>Son, who was clearly distressed after seeing the severity of Gomes' injury, was sent off by referee Martin Atkinson for the challenge.</p>
      <p>The red card was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50309594">overturned on appeal</a> by the Football Association's independent regulatory commission on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Turkey forward Cenk Tosun scored a 97th-minute equaliser to earn a point for Everton after Dele Alli's second-half opener.</p>
