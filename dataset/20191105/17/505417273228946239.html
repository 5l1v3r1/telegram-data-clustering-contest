      <p>Klopp said after Liverpool <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/caoimhin-kelleher-save-liverpool-penalty-shootout/">beat Arsenal on penalties</a> in the previous round of the EFL Cup that they would not play both fixtures in such a short space of time.</p>
      <p>However, Liverpool announced on Tuesday evening that they will use two entirely different squads for the ties.</p>
      <p>It will be the first time since December 1986 that the club have played two games in two days.</p>

      <p>Liverpool released a statement on the situation, which <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/372222-club-statement-carabao-cup-aston-villa">reads</a>:</p>
      <p>“We would like to thank the EFL for their efforts to accommodate us and we can confirm alternative dates were discussed, but ultimately none were considered suitable without compromising the scheduling of the competition itself or placing an undue strain on our playing staff.</p>
      <p>“As a result, we will be utilising two playing squads simultaneously, with one squad participating in the Fifa Club World Cup in Qatar and another in the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>“The club would like to take this opportunity to underline that while this is not an ideal scenario, it is an outcome which was arrived at with the best interests of the competition, our fellow clubs and ourselves as the sole motivating factor.”</p>
