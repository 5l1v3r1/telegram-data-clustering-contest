      <h1>Ten reasons why the West Midlands is lighting the way to a digital revolution</h1>
      <h2>Birmingham and the wider region are at the pulsating heart of innovations in fields ranging from the advent of 5G to driverless cars - with our innovators set to change everyday life forever</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-05T17:19:01+00:00">05 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Layton, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/josh-layton/</a></address>
      <p>To find the way to the future, look no further than Birmingham, Coventry and Leamington Spa.</p>
      <p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, the West Midlands is propelling the country into a new age of technology ranging from virtual reality to remote-controlled cranes.</p>
      <p>If that sounds like a grand claim, consider the thousands of visionary start-ups across the region, the gaming hub in Leamington Spa and the advent of high-speed 5G.</p>
      <p>There’s a wealth of dynamic talent among the entrepreneurs, small enterprises and multi-national companies in a pioneering region with a £128billion economy.</p>
      <p>In 2019, the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/special-features/birmingham-business-regeneration-city-centre-16094643">Region in Renaissance networking event</a> , Birmingham Tech Week and the <a href="https://www.business-live.co.uk/sponsored/everything-you-need-know-linn-16768911?fbclid=IwAR0dLhq11stuxxegV3hzo7G3qquJYjnrmnjoCfByECaTrVwPiJtpnjBsNHY">Linn Academy at the ICC</a> have all provided forums for innovators, adopters and disruptors to shape the future.</p>
      <p>There’s much more to look forward to, including the <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/special-features/gabby-logan-hosts-commonwealth-games-16001418">Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games</a> , which is expected to further drive business, skills and transport network growth as it brings more than a million visitors to state-of-the-art venues across the region.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Even setting aside HS2, which is facing questions over its viability, transport links including the Midland Metro are in for a major upgrade in future years, further enhancing a dynamic, fast-moving region.</p>
      <p>BirminghamLive and our sister website CoventryLive are also running an award scheme to celebrate the best tech and digital companies across the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>The event will gather together some of the finest tech talent when it takes place at the ICC on December 12, 2019. For more information and to buy tickets click <a href="https://reachplcevents.com/events/westmidlands/techawards/">here</a></p>
      <p>Here are 10 reasons why the West Midlands is truly future-proof:</p>
      <h3>1 Enter 5G...</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/article16991760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Huawei27-9-1902_result.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Superfast broadband and mobile coverage is one of the benefits of 5G.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The West Midlands is the UK's first large-scale 5G 'test bed' - paving the way for the roll-out of the high-speed network across the country.</p>
      <p>The multi-million pound trial, announced by the government in September 2018, is driving a hotbed of innovation. Meaning Fifth Generation in full, the high-speed mobile networks are heralding a wave of new technology with speeds up to 10 times faster than 4G.</p>
      <p>Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, the Internet of Things and autonomous vehicles are among the areas being pushed into the mainstream by the advance. </p>
      <p>Some of the potentially game-changing uses were demonstrated by West Midlands 5G (WM5G) at Birmingham City University in September 2019, including virtual reality goggles that ‘see through walls’, an interactive sporting experience and autonomous robot arms.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>WM5G was set up after the region’s successful bid to become the UK’s first test bid, with the organisation aiming to make the region the most advanced in the country. Many business and civic leaders regard 5G as the most profound step-change in communications ever – with the West Midlands in prime position to benefit when the 5G tech hits the mass market in 2020.</p>
      <p>Huawei has opened a 5G training centre in Birmingham to bring local businesses and the education community together in driving the West Midlands forward. More than 150 5G-ready engineers have graduated from the centre, spreading innovation throughout the region.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>A major new business and leisure district is being realised at Paradise Birmingham, luring some of the biggest and most dynamic companies to the region.</p>
      <p>The new city centre area will include shops, restaurants, high-spec office buildings, public squares and a four-star hotel.  Being completed in phases, the £700million scheme is at the core of the city’s wider long-term regeneration. Once completed, it will be an entirely new urban neighbourhood attracting millions of visitors every year.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Leamington Spa area has emerged as a global engine room for the computer gaming industry. The town’s prolific success has earned it the name ‘Silicon Spa’, which also includes Warwick and Southam, where Codemasters has its headquarters.</p>
      <p>Around 130 of the UK's best gaming companies are based in the West Midlands, employing a total of around 3,500 people full-time. In the Silicon Spa cluster, around 75% of the digital media companies are in the gaming sector, employing around 10% of the total UK games development workforce. Playground Games, Ubisoft and Hardlight, a division of gaming giant Sega, also call the cluster home. Hit games that the town has been pivotal in creating include Sonic the Hedgehog, Formula One, Forza Horizon, Guitar Hero Live and Micro Machines.</p>
      <p>Codemasters, makers of the award-winning Colin McRae rally series, has been at the heart of the success story after being set up by the Darling brothers more than 30 years ago.  </p>
      <p>One of the brothers, David, went on to found Kwalee, which specialises in apps and mobile gaming, creating games such as ‘Jetpack Jump’ and ‘Shootout 3D’. In September 2019, Codemasters announced two new partnerships with major Chinese company NetEase Inc, ensuring Silicon Spa remains part of global sector’s DNA.</p>

        <figcaption>South and City College Birmingham launches drone tech course with demo used by rap megastar Drake for video</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Flying drones, tackling cyber-crime and creating the next generation of advanced robots.</p>
      <p>These are among the innovative courses for young people aspiring to be part of an exciting digital future - and they are being offered for the first time in the West Midlands at South and City College Birmingham (SCCB).</p>
      <p>With a lack of digital skills expected to cost the UK economy as much as £145 billion over the next decade, such specialisms are in high demand.</p>
      <p>SCCB is helping students to counter this shortage and win opportunities in their future careers by launching the first ever emerging technology courses in the West Midlands at its Digbeth campus.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A huge shortage of drone operators, in particular, has prompted a call out for talented students to master tech that has been used for everything from monitoring football crowds to filming rap superstar Drake's music videos. The new generation of skilled workers is also being fostered at the Institute of Coding at Coventry University, which has been nominated in our <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-midlands-tech-awards">Tech Awards 2019.</a></p>
      <p>Tomorrow’s digital talents are being developed in the initiative involving 25 Higher Education Institutes and more than 60 industry partners</p>

        <figcaption>David Hardman MBE, of Innovate Birmingham, believes Birmingham offers a wealth of opportunity. (Image: Birmingham Mail)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Visionary digital businesses and entrepreneurs are hitting the ground running in the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>The region is home to more than 13,000 tech companies, worth around £5billion to the local economy. The scene is rapidly growing, too, and the cluster of business in Birmingham have earned it a ‘Silicon Canal’ nickname. Many of the newcomers to the tech scene gather at the annual Birmingham Tech Week, where they consider everything from drone racing to space-age ways to power businesses. The next event is already slated for October 2020, with a promise to “demonstrate why Birmingham is at the heart of innovation”.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>David Hardman MBE, of Innovation Birmingham, which supports the city’s tech and start-up community, told <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/special-features/birmingham-business-regeneration-city-centre-16094643">Region in Renaissance</a> the region offers a wealth of exciting prospects, including blue chip companies relocating to the city.</p>
      <p>He said: “The opportunity is in the city today as a consequence of timing. I’ve been here now 11 years and for the past five years it’s woken up. There is the inward investment with HSBC and the likes, all the building that’s going on and the skills and talent that are here. </p>
      <p>"The start-up community is huge and I’m in digital space, and the digital community is growing. To me, the key thing is opportunity.”</p>

      <p>Creating a thriving community where eCommerce businesses can share ideas, gain practical skills and speak with experts, the gathering put the spotlight on a world-class line up of speakers and business representatives, including Lady Karren Brady.</p>
      <p>The talks were complemented by a varied program including ‘seller panels’ with entrepreneurs who have mastered eBay and Amazon, workshops with leading international businesses offering practical advice and face-to-face sessions with industry professionals.</p>
      <p>More than 1,000 guests included PayPal, eBay and the Department of Trade and Industry. They joined a high-calibre roll of attendees in recent years also including ASOS, ShipStation and Shopify Plus. Founded in 2013 by Linnworks, an eCommerce platform, the academy banishes feelings of isolation and uncertainty among online traders, allowing them to connect offline and flourish in an industry worth more than £137 billion in the UK alone last year, according to the ONS. If you sell online, then you can’t afford to miss this unique eCommerce event.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Digbeth has always been slightly ahead of the curve, and the digital industries are no exception.</p>
      <p>Birmingham’s evolution into a heaving industrial powerhouse in the 18th Century stemmed from an initial flush of endeavour in Deritend.</p>
      <p>The shadows of Digbeth’s industrial heritage remain defined by the area’s architecture and old brick buildings. But the suburb is being reborn a creative and digital hub, branching out into fields such as holographics, 3D printing, virtual reality and mobile technology.</p>
      <p>Leading digital names in Digbeth include creative agency Digital Glue and Fazeley Studios, a community of tech businesses. Part of the iconic Custard Factory, Fazeley Studios joined fellow Digbeth venues Millennium Point and STEAMhouse lab to host a BBC digital skills day in September 2019. Among the innovators, free spirits and disruptors is Maryan Mohammed.</p>
