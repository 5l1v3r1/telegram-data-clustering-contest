      <p>(CNN) - A small black and white pup is continuing her road to recovery after being rescued just in time from a freezing Illinois lake over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Dory was inside a cage when Bryant Fritz spotted her floating in the lake and jumped in to save her.</p>
      <p>She'll remain with animal control services until a police investigation wraps up, the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine said.</p>
      <p>Once she's up for adoption, Fritz says he wants to bring her home with him.</p>
      <p>"I'm so happy she made it," he told CNN.</p>
      <p>When he spotted her in the water, no one was around, the middle school science teacher said. He took his sweater off and jumped in.</p>
      <p>"I thought about calling someone but I didn't think she had an extra five or 10 minutes," he said. "I just didn't know."</p>
      <p>He put her in a car, wrapped her in a blanket and took her to the animal hospital.</p>
      <p>The dog arrived at the University of Illinois Veterinary Teaching Hospital hypothermic and was so cold, thermometers couldn't get a reading, the facility said. It took about three hours of warming efforts to get her temperature up to normal levels.</p>
      <p>"She also needed care for wounds that do not appear to be related to being in the lake," the hospital said.</p>
      <p>Fritz hasn't seen the dog since but wants to be her forever home.</p>
      <p>"We are the first ones on the list," he says.</p>
