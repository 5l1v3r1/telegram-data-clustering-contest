      <p>Students at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) are demonstrating against the institution's draft dormitory manual which has proposed introducing changes like raising dormitory fees, enforcement of dress codes, imposing a curfew on students and barring students from participating in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911051077226880-indian-policemen-protest-in-new-delhi-after-multiple-officers-beaten-by-lawyers/">protests</a>.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of students have gathered at the university premises and raising slogans while playing trumpets and beating drums and carrying banners, and posters.</p>
      <p>The protesters have blasted the draft dormitory manual, saying it goes against the idea of the institution of higher education.</p>
