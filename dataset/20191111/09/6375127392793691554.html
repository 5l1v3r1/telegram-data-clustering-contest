      <h3>THE “sound economic policy” of the Duterte administration, which ends at 12 noon on June 30, 2022, continues to play a key role in ensuring the Philippine economy’s astonishing growth.</h3>
      <p>And we are made to believe that Filipinos, particularly the poor, see a brighter future under the government of President Duterte, the first Mindanaoan to hold the country’s top political post.</p>
      <p>House Majority Leader and Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez, a lawyer and banker by profession, attributed the faster economic growth in the third quarter of 2019 to this “sound economic policy.”</p>
      <p>The United States-educated Romualdez noted that since taking over the presidency in 2016, Duterte has been pursuing structural reforms needed to guarantee the economic takeoff.  </p>
      <p>Official records show that the Philippine economy, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), registered 6.2 percent growth during the third quarter of 2019 (July-September.)</p>
      <p>The 6.2 percent growth rate was faster than the 5.5 percent and 6 percent GDP growth rates recorded in the second quarter of 2019 and third quarter of 2018, respectively.</p>
      <p>The House, led by Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, is determined to pursue vital economic measures aimed at sustaining higher productivity growth, said Romualdez, chair of the rules committee.</p>
      <p>Deputy Speakers Mikee Romero and Raneo Abu and Rep. Sonny Lagon joined Romualdez in citing Duterte, the economic team and other lawmakers for working in unison to ensure the passage of vital bills.</p>
      <p>With the country’s “impressive” economic growth, various sectors, including some critics, are likely to support government programs and initiatives, as Duterte nears the end of his six-year presidency.</p>
