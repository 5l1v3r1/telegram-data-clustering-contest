      <p>"First and foremost, thank God because I definitely don't have to be here," Kevin said. "Being that I am, it makes me appreciate life even more. It makes me appreciate the things that really matter. Family. I want to thank my wife and kids, who really stepped up to the plate for me."</p>
      <p>Thanking his fans he continued, "You have no idea the effect you have on us as entertainers... your energy, your support... it means the world. And I truly want to thank you guys for being there for me in my difficult time."</p>
