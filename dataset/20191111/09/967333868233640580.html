      <p>​The hit Aamir-Kareena duo is returning to the silver screen after the 2009 hit movie “3 Idiots” that became the 10th-highest-grossing Indian film in overseas markets, where it made $30.5 million.</p>
      <p>After back to back international hits, Aamir’s last film “Thugs of Hindostan” proved to be a box office disaster despite a dazzling star cast which included screen luminary Amitabh Bachchan and actress Katrina Kaif.</p>
      <p>To play the character’s younger incarnation in the movie, the 54-year old actor reportedly dropped nearly 40 pounds (20 kg).</p>
