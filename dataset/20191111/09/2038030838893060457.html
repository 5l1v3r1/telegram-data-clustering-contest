      <h1>Here's why Meghan and Kate were on different balconies for Remembrance Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:59:15+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Bashiera Parker (@bparks_)</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town – There's no feud here – though Meghan and Kate were on two separate balconies for Remembrance Day on Sunday, and pretty much everyone picked up on it, there's a simple reason for the separation.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29750184/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-different-balconies-remembrance-day/"><b>Elle</b></a>, the royals are grouped according to precedence – so of course, the wife of the future king would stand next to the queen. And because the balcony isn't quite as big as the one at Buckingham Palace where all the royals watch the annual Trooping the Colour, they were separated.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019110980396/meghan-kate-william-harry-sit-separately-festival-remembrance/"><b>HELLO! Magazine</b></a>, precedence is also the reason the Sussexes and Cambridges sat on either side of the queen for the Festival of Remembrance on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The royals spent the weekend honouring the men and women who'd dedicated their lives to their country – and it was the first time Harry, Meghan, William and Kate were seen together publicly since the royal charity polo in July, and since <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/prince-harry-on-rumoured-rift-with-william-were-certainly-on-different-paths-20191021"><b>Prince Harry spoke candidly about his rumoured rift with Prince William</b></a>.</p>
      <p>In the ITV documentary that followed the Sussex Royal Tour of Africa, Harry told Tom Bradby, "The majority of stuff is created out of nothing. As brothers, we have good days, and we have bad days.</p>
      <p>"Inevitably, stuff happens. But we're brothers, we'll always be brothers."</p>
      <p>He admitted: "We're certainly on different paths at the moment, I'll always be there for him and as I know, he'll always be there for me. We don't see each other as much as we used to because we're so busy, but I love him dearly."</p>
      <p>Prince Harry may have been referring to the different paths they've taken work-wise. Earlier in the year, they announced The Royal Foundation – the joint charity established for both The Cambridges and The Sussexes – would become William and Kate's alone, while <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/name-of-prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-new-foundation-revealed-20190718"><b>Harry and Meghan went on to create Sussex Royal The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, while many are convinced the fab four have entirely split, it seems there's a reason behind every royal formation and every appearance. There's no feud here.</p>
