        <b>Angad Vir Singh Bajwa and Mairaj Ahmad Khan won gold and silver medals respectively, as they sealed Olympic quota places at the Asian Shooting Championships in Doha on Sunday. Meanwhile, Aishwarya Pratap Singh Tomar won the Olympic quota place in the men’s rifle 3-position event with a bronze medal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A qualifying shoot-off on 120 with six others was followed up by the Asian champion Angad pipping Olympian Mairaj 6-5 in the tie-shoot for the gold after the two had tied on 56. Along with Aishwarya’s Olympic quota place, the tally for the country has gone up to 15 for shooting.</p>
      <p>It was a fitting climax for the day for India, in which the young Aishwary Pratap Singh Tomar clinched the men’s rifle 3-position Olympic quota with the bronze medal.</p>
      <p>“15 quotas and a very special 1st &amp; 2nd in Skeet. Angad and Mairaj - Bravo boys super proud of you two. Way to go team India you exceeded my estimate by an additional quota!,” Raninder Singh tweeted, reported Sportstar.</p>
      <p>The trio of medals overshadowed the brilliant performances by Manu Bhaker and Abhishek Verma, who won the mixed air pistol gold, beating the other Indian pair of Yashaswini Singh Deswal and Saurabh Chaudhary 16-10. </p>
      <p>Even the juniors were not to be left behind with Esha Singh and Sarabjot Singh bagging the mixed air pistol junior gold with a 16-10 win over Korea. Priya Raghav and Akash, the other Indian team in the event, finished fifth in the second phase, narrowly missing a medal, after having topped qualification in the first stage with 580.</p>
