      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:56:16+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/4660/sports-desk/" target="_blank">Sports Desk</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan’s most successful cueist Muhammad Asif on Monday received a warm welcome at the Karachi airport after he won his second world title.</p>
      <p>Asif defeated Jeffery Roda eight frames to five in the final of the World Snooker Championship in Antalya, Turkey.</p>
      <p>He had earlier won the world championship in 2012.</p>
      <p>Asif, who hails from Faisalabad, while talking to media in Karachi said: “I am thankful to Allah for the win. He helped me to this big victory. I was hopeful that I will win the title. The people have showered a lot of love on me.”</p>

      <p>He continued by ruing the lack of support from the government of Pakistan. “The government doesn’t motivate us. I am thankful to the Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Association for their support and help.”</p>
      <p>He added that the win was not alone his to take credit for. “This is not an individual victory, this is Pakistan’s victory. I am happy that I was able to raise Pakistan’s flag high one again.”</p>
      <p>Asif then made a humble request to the government of Pakistan. “I would request the government to support us. I didn’t receive the legal winning prize of Rs10 million when I first won the world title, however that is an old story.”</p>
      <p>He then dedicated the win to the “Kashmiri brothers and sisters”.</p>
