      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s ticket to London for medical treatment has been canceled today (Monday) due to delay in excluding his name from Exit Control List (ECL). <br/><br/>Nawaz Sharif was scheduled to travel UK on Qatar Airways flight QR629 today. However, his ticket has been canceled as the authorities have not removed his name from ECL yet. <br/><br/>Party sources told that Nawaz Sharif’s daughter Maryam Nawaz, his brother Shehbaz Sharif and personal doctor Dr Adnan were also due to leave Pakistan along with the ex-PM. <br/><br/>They further told that arrangements for best medical treatment for Nawaz Sharif have been completed at Harley Street Clinic in London by his son Hussain Nawaz.</p>

        <b>Nawaz’s deteriorating health</b>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The doctors at the Sharif Medical City Hospital recommended shifting the erstwhile premier abroad for treatment as his platelets count has dropped below 30,000.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz said her father, Nawaz Sharif, must go anywhere around the world where his treatment is possible.</p>
      <p>Maryam Nawaz talked to media outside an accountability court (AC) in Lahore and maintained that it is another debate whether Nawaz Sharif is willing for treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>She told that the PML-N supreme leader’s health is still very critical as his platelets count is not getting stable despite medication.</p>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday had been discharged from Lahore’s Services Hospital, where he was undergoing a medical treatment for 16 days due to fluctuation in his platelets count.</p>
