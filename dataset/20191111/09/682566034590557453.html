      <p>Cape Town -<b> Adam Gilchrist </b>has backed <b>Tim Paine </b>to continue as Australia Test captain, saying the current national skipper is still the best wicketkeeper in the country.</p>
      <p>Paine took over the Australia leadership role after the ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town in March 2018 and in one year has helped the Aussies retain the Ashes urn in England.</p>
      <p>While his skills behind the stumps has not been questioned, Paine's batting form is a concern as he only scored one fifty in England at an average of 20.</p>
      <p>Australia's limited-overs gloveman Alex Carey is knocking hard on the door for a Test call-up but Glichrist feels the Australia selectors should stick with Paine.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event in Mumbai, Gilchrist said: "(If you look at) what he took on, when he took it on, he in partnership with (coach) Justin (Langer) and all the players have done a remarkable job over the past 12 months to just get a nice, stable balance back.</p>
      <p>"I can't see any rush to push him out, as long as he's still performing, like we all had to, to stay in the team.</p>
      <p>"Like every other player, he's got a hold of his spot in the team as being selected as the best available option for that player type.</p>
      <p>"I think he's doing a wonderful job (as captain)."</p>
      <p>Australia have a busy home summer ahead in the longest format as they host Pakistan in a two-match series later this month and then welcome New Zealand during traditional Christmas and New Year period.</p>
