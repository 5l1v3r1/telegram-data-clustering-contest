      <p>The big news from this past weekend’s Camp Flog Gnaw festival is going to be <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2064549/drake-booed-offstage-in-surprise-appearance-at-camp-flog-gnaw/video/">Drake getting booed offstage</a>. But last night, Tyler, The Creator’s annual festival also brought us another fun story. YG performed his immortal 2016 truth-to-power anthem “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/1872163/yg-nipsey-hussle-fdt-fuck-donald-trump-video/video/">FDT (Fuck Donald Trump)</a>.” And he had help from Stormy Daniels.</p>
      <p>Stormy Daniels is, of course, the porn star who had an I-guess-I-have-to-say-alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2011. Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen paid her $130,000 in hush money, and the ensuing story — which included Cohen claiming that Trump hadn’t paid him back — landed Cohen in prison and briefly positioned Daniels’ lawyer as a Democratic presidential contender.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, while playing Camp Flog Gnaw, YG — possibly riffing on the moment from a couple of weeks ago where he <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063035/yg-brings-fan-onstage-kicks-him-off-when-he-wont-yell-fuck-donald-trump/video/">kicked a fan offstage</a> for refusing to say “fuck Donald Trump” — brought Daniels to the stage and said, “I want you to state your name. I want you to yell out, ‘Fuck Donald Trump!'” Daniels responded, “My name is Stormy fucking Daniels, and I am the reason Donald Trump <i>is</i> fucked.”</p>
      <p>YG feigned shock, and this exchange happened: “You the one that fucked Donald Trump!” “I wouldn’t really call it fucking.” “No, you really fucked Donald Trump, though!” “No, I just laid there.” Then YG hugged her and performed “FDT” while she danced. It was… cute? Watch it below.</p>

      <p>I look forward to YG doing this bit with every disgruntled member of Trump’s cabinet. The Jeff Sessions one is gong to be fun.</p>
