      <p>Aston Martin’s share price climbed today after HSBC advised investors to buy the troubled luxury car maker’s stock despite its latest loss.</p>
      <p>The manufacturers of James Bond’s favourite ride swung to a £13.5m loss in its latest quarter as Brexit fears dampened demand in the UK and EMEA.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But HSBC gave the company’s stock a ‘Buy’ rating. The firm has said 2020’s Bond movie, No Time to Die, should give sales a lift in the key market of China. </p>
      <p>Aston Martin’s share price rose 3.9 per cent to 485.3p in early trading, after sharp rises at the end of last week despite an underwhelming set of results.</p>
      <p>But Markets.com’s chief market analyst, Neil Wilson, expressed scepticism of HSBC’s new rating.</p>
      <p>“On a purely valuation basis there is an argument, but debt levels are a worry,” he said.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin is sitting on an £800m debt pile, up a third from last December’s £560m. Meanwhile third quarter revenue slumped 11 per cent, while car production sank 16 per cent.</p>
      <p>The firm has seen its share price plunge 75 per cent since its October 2018 debut of 1,900p to today’s 485.3p value.</p>
      <p>Last week it warned that demand for its least pricey model, the Aston Martin Vantage, remains below its original targets.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It is now pinning its hopes on its first SUV model, the DBX, as part of a plan to launch seven cars in just seven years. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, April’s Bond movie release will feature four Aston Martins – the FB5, the V8 Saloon, the new DBS Superleggera and the Valhalla.</p>
