      <h3>MORE than a month after Philippine National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa issued his series of directives, the good news is that police officers and men appear to be strictly complying with his orders with PNP intelligence agents yet to spot or apprehend any violators to date, the Journal Group learned yesterday.</h3>
      <p>First, police officers and men have strictly followed Lt. Gen. Gamboa’s directive that there should be no golf during weekdays and it may only be allowed during holidays and weekends. PNP intelligence agents have been posted in golf courses ready to take photos and videos of violators of the said directive.</p>
      <p>2nd, there have been no apprehension yet of police personnel with unauthorized presence in places of ill-repute, gambling joints, casinos, cockpits, public drinking places or those places analogous to this unless they are authorized to conduct law enforcement function.</p>
      <p>3rd, there have been no reports yet on violators of the ‘no-take’ in whatever form of material or monetary consideration from operators of illegal gambling, drug dealers, including any form of bribe, grease money or “kotong” from analogous illegal sources which was declared by Gamboa.</p>
      <p>4th, Gen. Gamboa’s directive against the use of recovered or evidence motor vehicles/motorcycles appear to be holding with the PNP Highway Patrol Group headed by Brigadier General Dionardo B. Carlos strictly implementing the directive with the help of the PNP Integrity Monitoring and Enforcement Group headed by Colonel Ronald O. Lee.</p>
      <p>Last but not the least, police are strictly enforcing Gamboa’s order which prohibited the use by PNP personnel of PNP or PNP personnel’s private vehicles without plate number or conduction sticker number. In Camp Crame, the PNP Headquarters Support Service headed by Brig. Gen. Dennis L. Basngi has strictly barred the entry of private and government vehicles without plate numbers or conduction stickers.</p>
      <p>Gen. Gamboa has reiterated the directives he want to be fully complied with by all members of the 195,000-strong police force under pain of criminal and administrative offenses should they violate it.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIAC said he wants all policemen in the country to follow the directives and guidance that he personally issued directly to unit directors if only to be more emphatic with the authority vested him by the National Police Commission to decisively effect implementation of the Internal Cleansing Program and all other related issuances on organizational discipline and bureaucratic conduct:</p>
      <p>“Furthermore, all PNP personnel should serve the public with a smile and with utmost courtesy. We are public servants. All personnel should render salute to superior officers and show utmost respect. All leaders should look after the welfare of their men,” he said.</p>
      <p>The PNP-OIC likewise said he wants ‘Tamang Bihis’ to be strictly enforced with corresponding stiffer penalties for infractions.</p>
      <p>“All PNP personnel must not tolerate lawlessness or disorder and must be tough against criminals without fear or favor,” he added.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said he has directed concerned Directorial Staff to reduce this series of directives and instructions into a Command Memorandum Circular to be circulated to all PNP units through official channels.</p>
      <p>He also said that despite the 20 years of institutional reforms, a vision of a highly capable, effective, credible PNP has yet to become a reality.</p>
      <p>“There are still legal, policy and systematic dysfunctions that need to be addressed particularly in our disciplinary mechanism. Short of working for its total independence, we will resolve to make sure the PNP Internal Affairs will have the necessary resources and policy support to make it more fit for its purpose.</p>
      <p>We have also started to closely review other systems and procedures to identify chronic weaknesses that hinder the organization from being truly effective in delivering its mandate. Once again, we assure our people that the PNP remains on track with renewed vigor to reform itself into the ideal shape to fight crime, illegal drugs and corruption. We cannot do this alone. We need all the help we can muster to win and  achieve a safer and more secured community every Filipino truly deserves,” he said.</p>
