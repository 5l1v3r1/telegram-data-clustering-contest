      <p>We love <i>Katamari Damacy</i>, and I'm confident we'll also love Keita Takahashi's latest oddball, <i>Wattam</i>.</p>
      <p>It's been such a long time coming, but the friend-making puzzle-adventure game is about to launch. Look for it to land on PlayStation 4 and PC (via the Epic Games Store) on December 17, 2019.</p>
      <p>"Six years constipation has been relieved finally," <a href="https://twitter.com/KeitaTakahash/status/1193932407457497090">the creator said</a>.</p>

      <p>It'll run $20, normally â€“ but folks who pre-order <i>Wattam </i>on PS4 or PC can shave off 15%.</p>
      <p>It's a game about "more than 100" toy-like characters and the strange and often laugh-out-loud-funny bonds they can form. I feel like people are either capital-I Into It, or they never want to hear about this silly game again. No middle ground. Even if it seems mechanically simple, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../katamari-designer-s-new-game-wattam-is-all-warm-and-fuzzy-293122.phtml">I wouldn't write it off</a>.</p>
      <p>If I had kids, I would play the absolute <i>heck</i> outta <i>Wattam </i>with them on Christmas day. Is that even a thing? Video games that play best on Christmas day? I don't know. But if it is, <i>Wattam </i>qualifies.</p>
