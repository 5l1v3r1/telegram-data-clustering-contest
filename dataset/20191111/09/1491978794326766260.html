        <i>After years of negotiation and Brexit still looming on the horizon, publishers are split on how to engage with opposing views. Are they doing enough?</i>
      </p>
      <p>When you ask publishing insiders to paint a picture of the impact of Brexit, they tend to produce something that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/16/the-scream-edvard-munch-ultimate-image-political-age-british-museum">looks like Munch’s </a><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/16/the-scream-edvard-munch-ultimate-image-political-age-british-museum">The Scream</a></i>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrew-franklin">Andrew Franklin</a>, the managing director of Profile, sums it up thus: “The only upside I can see is that broccoli is apparently going to be in shorter supply.” He cites the rising cost of paper and printing, concerns over intellectual property rights, difficulties with exports and the potentially devastating economic effect on the high street bookshops that are so crucial to the trade.</p>
      <p>But while publishing is far from the only industry that fears the economic impact of Brexit, it faces an additional, very particular challenge: its products are responsible for helping the British public make sense of the deeply divided country in which we find ourselves. How can an industry so fervently remainer in spirit engage with the arguments in favour of leave? How can it reach the people who voted for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a> – and to what extent does it want to?</p>
      <p>It is a dilemma I became uncomfortably aware of as literary programmer for the Brighton festival in 2018, as I considered how to reach out beyond the cosy pro-remain bubble. I remember watching Ali Smith deliver a talk on her highly regarded “Brexit novel” <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/autumn-ali-smith-review">Autumn</a></i>. It was clear from the audience response that the vast majority – if not all – were remain voters. When I invited a pro-leave speaker to take part in a political debate, he had to contend with a room filled with people who regarded him as something close to the antichrist.</p>
      <p>With a divisive election looming and rising rates of hate crime, the question of how best to engage with opposing views is, says David Shelley of the publishing giant Hachette, hotly debated in acquisitions meetings. “It’s important to uphold free speech, but social justice is also a big part of our mission,” he says. He is proud that Hachette publishes authors from across the political spectrum, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/06/everywoman-by-jess-phillips-review-a-life-less-ordinary-empowering-labour-mp">Labour’s Jess Phillips</a> to the controversial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/17/great-betrayal-rod-liddle-brexit-review">rightwing commentator Rod Liddle</a>. “But we wouldn’t want to publish any book that played a part in oppressing minorities, or went against our inclusive ethos.” Other publishers, however, take a strong anti-leave line. Franklin, for example, told me in no uncertain terms that leavers are not the sector’s target market. “What would we be publishing? Fantasy histories of a Britain in which servants doff their caps?”</p>

      <p>This kind of attitude should be understood as a reaction against the UK’s largely rightwing press, much of which has so powerfully campaigned for leave. But nevertheless it is fuel for the fire of those pro-Brexit writers whose claim to represent the marginalised is often based on their feeling that they are looked down on by lefty metropolitan types who are the arbiters of culture. The Bookseller recently reported that some <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/indie-booksellers-split-david-cameron-memoir-1078736">independent bookshops have been refusing to stock David Cameron’s memoir</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/14/iain-dale-quits-blogging">Iain Dale</a>, a conservative commentator and former director of Biteback, tells me that he often found bookshops would take the position that “anything to the right of Tony Blair wasn’t for them”. Biteback published the US lefty <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/19/bernie-sanders-profile-democrat-presidential-candidate">Bernie Sanders </a>as well as the commentator Katie Hopkins (Dale says that Hopkins has subsequently lurched into bigotry, and he would not publish her now). He laments the lack of books explaining the arguments in favour of Brexit: “There is a real thirst for knowledge and understanding about what is happening to this country. And that is not being well served by British publishing at the moment. Both sides lose, because if you don’t understand the other argument, you are never going to be able to persuade people.”</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/08/visas-refused-for-a-dozen-authors-invited-to-book-festival">Nick Barley</a>, director of the Edinburgh international book festival, the greatest challenge facing publishing is how to bridge this cultural divide. “People talk about the economic impact, but the cultural issues are much more important.” In a charged political climate, publishing needs to focus on enabling people to listen to one another, and to respect each other’s opinions – and that means inviting leavers to the party. “Some people on the remain side have not afforded dignity to those who voted leave.” He questions whether the industry’s drive towards greater diversity has been wide-ranging enough: “If we are to be truly inclusive, we need to include people whose views we don’t find palatable.”</p>
      <p>This point is echoed by the agent Toby Mundy, who has represented authors across the political spectrum from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/oliver-letwin-the-unlikely-brexit-rebel">Oliver Letwin</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardreeves">Richard Reeves</a>. He argues that the industry’s “definition of pluralism can often be narrow and metropolitan” – while publishers have largely recognised the need to increase racial diversity in the industry, attitudes towards political diversity are more complicated. “There are certain kinds of narratives that most of the industry is reluctant to publish and promote.” Mundy says he has noticed a difference between two visions of liberalism within publishing: “There’s an older generation of commissioning editors who are more inclined to take the view that any argument can be valuable, as long as it is interesting, well expressed and adheres to basic values of tolerance and decency. Many younger editors are more passionate about contemporary political struggles and take a narrower view about what they and their colleagues should publish.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/18/sharmaine-lovegrove-if-you-dont-have-diverse-workforce-wont-exist-dialogue-books-interview">Sharmaine Lovegrove</a>, the publisher at Dialogue, has been a powerful voice calling for greater diversity in the books world. For her, the arguments in favour of leave are anathema, as they are “rooted in negative perceptions around immigration – although there is a lot of denial about that”. She also takes issue with the idea that the problem is that the industry is too metropolitan. “It doesn’t represent London – this city is 46.2% BME [black and minority ethnic], and I’m the only black person running a list in corporate publishing.” But she agrees that since Brexit the industry is asking itself more complicated questions about identity. “I’m really aware that many people vilify working-class white men, assuming that they are racist. As a black woman, I know how it feels to have people make assumptions about you before you have opened your mouth. So I’m certainly open to those narratives, too.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, as these debates rage around them, writers have been setting about the hard work of reimagining what it might mean to be British. Although many editors say that it’s too early to judge how Brexit is going to play out in fiction, you could argue that British authors have been engaging with deep issues around place and identity for many years.</p>
      <p>A strong canon of work has emerged that subtly illuminates our national identity crisis. As well as the more overtly political “Brexlit” novels of Ali Smith and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/16/middle-england-by-jonathan-coe-review">Jonathan Coe</a>, there are many other works that engage with Britain’s changing social landscape less directly. In <i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/ghost-wall-sarah-moss-review">Ghost Wall</a></i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/28/ghost-wall-sarah-moss-review">, Sarah Moss</a> looks back into the ancient past to ask questions about oppression and masculinity. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/04/the-buried-giant-review-kazuo-ishiguro-tolkien-britain-mythical-past">Kazuo Ishiguro’s </a><i><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/04/the-buried-giant-review-kazuo-ishiguro-tolkien-britain-mythical-past">The Buried Giant</a></i>, a mythical tale of a Britain in which warring tribes have been afflicted by amnesia, was greeted with some bafflement on publication pre-referendum in 2015. But it has emerged as a prescient exploration of what the Economist has called “the violence that underpins national identity”. Nature writers including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/27/robert-macfarlane-word-hoard-rewilding-landscape">Robert M</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/27/robert-macfarlane-word-hoard-rewilding-landscape">acfarlane</a>, and novelists such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/rain-four-walks-in-english-weather-melissa-harrison-review-wicken-fen-dartmoor-darent-valley-wrekin">Melissa Harrison</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/08/beasting-benjamin-myer-review-austere-brilliantly-shocking">Benjamin Myers</a>, have helped to reinvigorate our emotional connection to the land and our environment. In the turbulent times ahead, their work will only become more relevant.</p>
