      <h1>China accuses US of using UN to 'meddle' in Tibet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T09:38:45+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 09:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>China accused the US on Monday of using the United Nations to "meddle" in Tibet, as Washington intensifies its bid to prevent Beijing from handpicking the Dalai Lama's successor.</p>
      <p>Last week, Sam Brownback, the United States' ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom, said the US wanted the UN to take up the succession issue of the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p>
      <p>The choice of the Dalai Lama's successor "belongs to the Tibetan Buddhists and not the Chinese government", Brownback told AFP.</p>
      <p>But Beijing responded angrily, saying the US is attempting to "meddle in China's internal affairs under the pretext of religious freedoms".</p>
      <p>"It is doomed to fail and will certainly be met with opposition from the international community," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing in Beijing.</p>
      <p>China -- which argues it has brought modernisation and development to the Himalayan region -- has increasingly hinted it could name the next Dalai Lama, who would presumably be groomed to support Chinese rule.</p>
      <p>The Chinese government has also indicated it is waiting out the Dalai Lama, believing his campaign for greater Tibetan autonomy will end with him.</p>
      <p>At age 84, the spiritual leader who once travelled incessantly has slowed down and earlier this year suffered a chest infection, although he is not known to have serious health issues.</p>
      <p>In 1995, the officially atheist government selected its own Panchen Lama and detained a six-year-old identified for the influential Buddhist position -- whom rights groups called the world's youngest political prisoner.</p>
      <p>Mindful of Beijing's plans, the 14th Dalai Lama has mused about breaking with the centuries-old tradition in which wandering monks look for signs that a young boy is the reincarnation.</p>
      <p>The Nobel Peace Prize winner has said that he could pick his own successor, possibly a girl, or even declare himself the final Dalai Lama.</p>
