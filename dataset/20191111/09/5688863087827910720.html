      <h3>The International sackathon</h3>
      <p>After a weekend of sensational football, a few managers find their jobs in dire trouble with <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/southampton">Southampton</a>, Watford, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/arsenal">Arsenal</a>, <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/everton">Everton</a>, and maybe even Mauricio Pochettino. But if we’re to believe the interweb then the international break will see at least three maybe four new managers walking in.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict:</b>
      </p>
      <p>This falls smack in the middle of the neutral zone because it should be some form of a sackathon if nothing more. Ralph Hasenhuttl looks out of sorts after his strong start at Southampton and with his side struggling to do more than barely survive which is cause for concern. Everton and Marco Silva look like a relationship on the verge of imploding. The other three, however, is an overreaction.</p>
      <p>Arsenal and their board have already backed Unai Emery, Mauricio Pochettino has too much of history and support within the Tottenham ranks to be sacked. But Watford! the Watford rumour is simply ridiculous. While their results haven’t gone their way, the Hornets have been a class apart compared to their initial Javi Gracia time. Sacking Quique Sanchez Flores now makes no sense and that’s the story.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_united">Manchester United</a> are back</h3>
      <p>Just one loss in their last seven games in all competitions, a convincing win against Brighton and Partizan Belgrade, and that draw against Liverpool has seen Manchester United fans exude incredible optimism.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Are they title contenders?? Not even in their dreams. Top four contenders?? Questionable but not out of the realm of possibility and that’s only if they keep this run going. It’s hard, especially given their fixtures over the next month or so. But it’s far from an overreaction and maybe it’s time for Red Devils to finally have some hope for the future.</p>
      <h3>Leicester are title contenders</h3>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers and his <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/leicester_city">Leicester City</a> side sit second in the Premier League, their highest spot since that 2015/16 title win, and look like one of the best sides in England. That has seen the hype train charge down the rails with many predicting a three-way title battle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Foxes are flying and their performances have been beyond exceptional and there’s no denying that but they’re far off from title challengers. Yes, they have a better side than the one that won the 2015/16 season, are playing gorgeous football and look like a top-four contender. But a title challenge?? That’s beyond their scope and it’s not an insult because <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/team/manchester_city">Manchester City</a> and Liverpool have spent years building their teams which is something that Leicester will take time to do. But if this is their base, then they’re on the verge of world dominance.</p>
      <h3>Tammy Abraham and <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/marcus_rashford">Marcus Rashford</a> debate</h3>
      <p>Tammy Abraham has equalled Marcus Rashford’s best scoring season and that has brought about debates as to who’s better and whether the Mancunian is actually worth all the hype.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oh internet, you never really fail to stop providing do you?? A myriad of opinions and for a writer, it’s a goal-mine. But this debate is simply nonsensical especially given the fact that they are two different men and on the opposite end of the spectrum as attackers. Tammy, while he has been brilliant, is an out-and-out goalscoring penalty box poacher. Yes, he does contribute to the build-up play but he’s a pure, un-adulterated goalscorer. Marcus Rashford, on the other hand, is more of a complete forward.</p>
      <p>Think <a href="https://sportscafe.in/football/player/sergio_aguero">Sergio Aguero</a>, at the same age, or Gabriel Jesus-esque which is exactly what Manchester United are hoping Rashford becomes. That on its own should put an end to any discussion.</p>
      <h3>VAR in general</h3>
      <p>Another weekend of controversial decisions, VAR decisions and more importantly another weekend of the on-field referees not looking at the screen. All this has lead to the question, is VAR really worth all that money and trouble??</p>
      <p>
        <b>Verdict:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tough question and it’s, to say the least, a bit of an overreaction. The VAR or video assistant referee is a brilliant tool when used correctly. That last part is the key portion and that’s something the Premier League haven’t done. Add that to a slew of keyboard warriors and the world comes crashing down. But given this is the first season, things will take time to bring about change before England truly adapts to their brand new robotic overlords. Till then, take the hits with the misses?</p>
