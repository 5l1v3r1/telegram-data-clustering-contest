      <h1>Saints striker Danny Mullen admits capital goal meant nothing after Hearts demolition</h1>
      <h2>Mullen levelled for the Buddies before Hearts ran out 5-2 winners in Gorgie.</h2>

      <p>Saints goalscorer Danny Mullen admits he couldn’t even savour his second <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> strike of the season.</p>
      <p>It was the second time that he and Jon Obika hit the back of the net in the same game, having managed that last month in a 2-0 win over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-johnstone-fc">St Johnstone</a> .</p>
      <p>After shipping five at the other end in Gorgie though, the 24-year-old former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> hitman admits the humbling scoreline was a sore one to take for every Saint in the dressing room.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a tough one to take. We’ll be hurting over the international break.</p>
      <p>“We scored two goals and we’ve still not at least drawn the game which is hard to take.</p>
      <p>“Now I’m in the team I want to keep playing well. When I went through I’m confident in my ability. But scoring today hasn’t come to anything.”</p>
