        <b>It is fair to say <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo's</a> first season with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> hasn't quite gone to plan but the Australian has admitted he doesn't regret his decision to move, despite not closing the gap to the top three.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ricciardo moved to Renault for the 2019 season after failing to agree on a new deal with his former team <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a>. The aim of the move was to help Renault close the gap to the top three teams but they have failed to do so, slipping behind <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> in the midfield battle.</p>
      <p>Despite not achieving everything they had set out to, Ricciardo does not regret his move to Renault.</p>

      <p><i>"Coming from Red Bull, I hoped we could reduce the gap to the top three teams, which we did not succeed in. It takes us at least another year to do that, I want to be better, that's clear, but it does is not that I regret the change,"</i> Ricciardo said as quoted by <a href="https://www.motorsport-magazin.com/formel1/news-259842-formel-1-ricciardo-auch-ohne-erfolge-gluecklicher-als-2018/">Motorsport-Magazin</a>.</p>

        <i>"I was pretty frustrated last year, I had some technical problems and needed a change I always leave the racetrack happy and fulfilled when I have achieved what was possible for me It is enough for yourself that you know you have done everything there have already been podiums with me was not satisfied."</i>
