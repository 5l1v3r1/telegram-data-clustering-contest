        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 11 – Majid Al Futtaim has launched its loyalty program across all its Carrefour stores in Kenya.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The MyCLUB program, which is present in several markets, is fully digital and accessible through the Carrefour Kenya App, allowing users to collect points based on their purchases at the retail stores.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>As such, for every Sh100 customers spend, they receive 2.5 points in return, while they also stand to gain additional points based on selected promotional items.</p>
      <p>Upon collecting 10,000 points, customers can either choose to redeem them instantly towards their bill or continue to accumulate points for a larger reward later.</p>
      <p>The app, which is available for download on Google Play and the App Store, also allows customers to get access to their digital receipts, regular updates, as well as information on upcoming offers.</p>
      <p>Franck Moreau, Country Manager of Carrefour in Kenya and Uganda at Majid Al Futtaim Retail said the move comes in response to changing consumer preferences for a more personalized approach while also tapping into the new digital shift in the retail space.</p>
      <p>The launch of MyCLUB demonstrates our commitment to our customers in Kenya, we value their loyalty and encourage them to sign up so that they gain even more from shopping at Carrefour,” he said.</p>
