          <b>RDHA Act 2019 </b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, the Act empowers the government to establish health authorities at regional and district levels. The authorities will be funded by the federal and provincial governments and report to a policy board chaired by the provincial health minister.</p>
      <p>The legislature stated that the serving doctors will continue to be regarded as civil servants and be entitled to pension and other benefits. The authority to transfer doctors as per need in healthcare in respective districts of domicile will remain with the regional health authority.</p>
      <p>The existing cadre will be treated ‘dying cadre’ and continue until the retirement of the last civil servant, following which the posts will be abolished. At this point, the regional authorities will be empowered to create new positions and hire as per regulations.</p>
