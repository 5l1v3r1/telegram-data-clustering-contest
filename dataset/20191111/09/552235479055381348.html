      <p>A former boxer attacked a shopkeeper with a Buckfast bottle in a frenzied racist attack.</p>
      <p>Aston Brown, 28, head-butted Mohammed Amin and plunged a Buckfast bottle into his face and head after racially abusing him over his ethnicity.</p>
      <p>Paisley Sheriff Court heard former prize fighter Brown had been thrown out of the Post Office shop – after loitering around and pestering staff – before he exploded in violence.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Prosecutor Keri Marshall said: “Mohammed Amin, witnesses Mohammed Sarwar and Fahid Amin were working in the shop along with another witness Kenneth Ogilvy, who was carrying out work outside the shop.</p>
      <p>“At around 7.20pm, the complainer was within the shop when the accused entered. The accused asked Fahid if he could charge his mobile phone. He was told no.</p>
      <p>“The accused then left and made his way down the side of the shop, where he continued to pace up and down.”</p>
      <p>Brown slinked back into the shop and was again asked to leave.</p>
      <p>The court heard Brown then lost the plot and started racially abusing staff at the store in Greenock Road, Inchinnan.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ms Marshall added: “The accused was shouting and swearing such phrases as ‘f****** black b*******’ and ‘P*** b*******’ as well as ‘I will f****** kill you all’ and ‘You are all dead’.</p>
      <p>“The complainer went to the shop door along with witness Ogilvy.</p>
      <p>“The accused ran back towards the complainer and headbutted him.</p>
      <p>“The complainer and Ogilvy grabbed hold of him. They were struggling with him and trying to restrain him.</p>
      <p>“The accused repeatedly punched the complainer on the body. The complainer seized hold of the accused, but stumbled and fell.</p>
      <p>“The accused then struck the complainer on the head with a Buckfast bottle, which he had removed from his jacket pocket.</p>
      <p>“The bottle broke as a result of this assault.</p>
      <p>“The accused then repeatedly tried to strike the complainer on the body with the broken bottle.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Witnesses including Fahid, who is Mohammed’s brother, and Mr Sarwar, went to the victim’s aid to help fight off Brown, who legged it from Inchinnan in the direction of Renfrew.</p>
      <p>The court heard Mr Amin was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley, were he received seven stitches to a wound above his left eye and four stitches to another gash on the back of his head.</p>
      <p>The doctor who treated the victim said the injuries will result in permanent scarring.</p>
      <p>Brown, who used to box professionally, pleaded guilty to charges of assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement, and making racially-prejudiced threats and comments to his victim on December 3, 2017.</p>
      <p>Brown, from Govan, also admitted further charges of resisting police and arrest and taking a vehicle without the owner’s permission, when he was pulled over by cops on the A8 near Bishopton on December 27, 2018.</p>
      <p>Defence agent Paul Lynch said his client realises “these are very serious matters,” and reserved his submission in defence of Brown until after the court had obtained background reports.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Tom McCartney warned “all options remain open” in sentencing him and Brown will discover his fate on December 10.</p>
