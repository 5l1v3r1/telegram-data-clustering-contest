      <p>When David Craig was just 18 his quick thinking actions helped save many lives aboard a 1943 wartime vessel.</p>
      <p>Now aged 94, the Second World War hero has spoken about the ordeal which could have cost him his life.</p>
      <p>David, along with 13 other sailors, received the King’s Commendation for getting rid of an unexploded bomb when it crashed through the deck of his ship in Russia 76 years ago.</p>
      <p>Now a great-grandfather of 10, Kilmarnock man David had joined the Dover Hill merchant ship as a radio officer.</p>
      <p>The ship, loaded with weapons, military vehicles and explosives, formed part of a 28-vessel convoy which left Scotland for Russia on February 15, 1943.</p>
      <p>The crew battled freezing conditions and storms and miraculously survived brutal attacks from the German Luftwaffe on their journey.</p>
      <p>The ship delivered its cargo to Murmansk unscathed by the barrage of bombings before anchoring in Kola inlet, where it came under attack again two months later.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>David recalled being blown across the deck as bombs fell.</p>
      <p>“A 1000-pound bomb exploded at the side nearest me,” he said. “I was blown off my feet. I wasn’t conscious of this at the time but it blew me right across the ship and I landed on the steel deck with a wallop.</p>
      <p>“Well, I think it knocked sense into me because I came to and I was starting to get up when one of the gunners came running down on to the deck and shouted ‘Are you alright, Sparks?’.</p>
      <p>“I looked behind me and there was a nice hole through the steel deck where another 1000-pound bomb had gone right through. It had gone right through the deck below it and into the coal bunkers.”</p>
      <p>The captain ordered David to signal to Murmansk and ask for bomb disposal personnel but none were available.</p>
      <p>The crew were left to decide how to handle the life-threatening situation alone.</p>
      <p>David said: “The captain gave everyone three choices: take a lifeboat to shore for safety, stay aboard and work the ship or volunteer to get the bomb out of the bunker.</p>
      <p>“I knew it was a bit of a stupid thing to do so I hesitated for a minute but the officer next to me, who had a wife and two kids, stepped forward so what could I do but also join the squad? Nineteen of us volunteered.</p>
      <p>“If the bomb had exploded I would have been blown to bits but I believe that there is always a time to be born and a time to die and I knew my time hadn’t come.”</p>
      <p>He said: “We started digging back the coal, trying to find the bomb. We didn’t know we’d have 22 feet to dig before we got to it.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the Germans discovered what we were up to and bombed us again, hoping to set off the bomb we were digging for.</p>
      <p>“Due to the bomb explosions and the concussion of our own guns, the coal fell back into the space where we were digging and things got difficult at times.”</p>
      <p>After two long days and nights the team finally got the bomb up on deck.</p>
      <p>The brave squad even precariously inscribed their names on the bomb before the disposal began.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “I couldn’t roll the bomb over in case I set it off so I wrote my name using chalk around the detonator after carefully cleaning all the muck off.</p>
      <p>“Most of the crew were Scottish or Londoners and the Londoners like a cup of tea before they do anything so, as we had the bomb on deck and had all written our names, we went for a cup of tea in the officers’ mess before we did anything else.”</p>
      <p>David was then one of three volunteers who put himself forward to sup-port a Russian air force officer and remove the detonator.</p>
      <p>He said: “He started to hammer the side of the detonator. Every time he hit it the hairs on my neck stood up straight against my duffle coat.</p>
      <p>“He got it moving and unscrewed it and said the bomb was safe so we dumped it over the side into the Kola inlet, where it probably lies to this day.”</p>
      <p>The Dover Hill finally left Kola in May and spent months in the White Sea before arriving in London in December 1943.</p>
      <p>David later worked his way up to chief radio officer and sailed all over the world during the war.</p>
      <p>When the war ended he came to settle in Kilmarnock and after leaving the Merchant Navy worked in the kiltwear industry.</p>
      <p>Originally from Nairn, Moray, the grandfather-of-four now suffers the poor eyesight and is supported by the charity Scottish War Blinded.</p>
      <p>But he still remembers his time at sea vividly.</p>
      <p>“When I was in Russia I never thought of being courageous,” David said.</p>
      <p>“All we wanted to do was to stay alive and stay in one bit.”</p>
