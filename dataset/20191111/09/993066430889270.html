      <p>Actress Tyldesley – who was eliminated earlier in the BBC One series – said she was “so delighted” to be continuing her Strictly journey.</p>
      <p>“I have absolutely fallen in love with dancing, so I can’t wait to get back on that dance floor and perform for the Strictly fans once more. Roll on January!” she said.</p>
      <p>Scott said she was hoping to perform some of her favourite routines from the competition again.</p>
      <p>“Strictly has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I’m thrilled that I’ll get to dance for everyone who has voted for me on the TV series,” she said.</p>

      <p>Bushell said he was “thrilled to be asked”.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’ve loved my journey on the TV show and have lost a stone and a half in weight – that shows how good dancing is for you. </p>
      <p>“I think I’ve shown that even a non-dancing dad in his 50s can learn some moves and hopefully I can inspire people in venues across the country too.” </p>
      <p>Barker added: “It’s been incredible, so what better way to see in the New Year than in a glittery costume, on tour, dancing for all the fans. Bring it on!”</p>
