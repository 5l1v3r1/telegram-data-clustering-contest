      <p>LONDON (Nov 11): Britain's economy grew at the slowest annual rate in nearly a decade in the three months to the end of September, as a global slowdown and Brexit worries hit business investment and manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Year-on-year gross domestic product growth slowed to 1.0% from 1.3% in the second quarter, Britain's Office for National Statistics said, its lowest since the first three months of 2010 and just below economists' forecasts in a <i>Reuters </i>poll of 1.1%.</p>
      <p>The slowdown reflected a smaller-than-expected rebound in quarterly GDP growth after a contraction in the second quarter, when businesses faced an overhang of stocks of raw materials after Brexit was delayed from the end of March.</p>
      <p>"Looking at the picture over the last year, growth slowed to its lowest rate in almost a decade," an ONS spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>During the third quarter, when Boris Johnson became prime minister, there were increasing concerns among businesses that Britain could have been heading for a no-deal Brexit on Oct 31.</p>
      <p>In the event, parliament forced Johnson to seek a delay and he has now called an early election for Dec 12 in an attempt to win a large enough majority for his preferred Brexit deal before a new deadline of Jan 31.</p>
      <p>Gross domestic product expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.3% in the third quarter of 2019, below the 0.4% reading expected by the Bank of England, as well as by private-sector economists.</p>
      <p>Britain's economy has lost momentum since the 2016 Brexit referendum, before which it typically grew more than 2% a year.</p>
      <p>Last week the BoE nudged up its growth forecast for 2019 to 1.4% from 1.3% â€” largely because of its expectation of a bigger pick-up in the third quarter than it forecast before.</p>
      <p>This would be the same growth rate as 2018 and the weakest since the financial crisis, while for 2020 the BoE expects a further slowdown to 1.3%.</p>
      <p>On top of Brexit, businesses across Europe have been suffering spill-over from the US-China trade war. Euro zone annual GDP growth slowed to 1.1% in the third quarter from 1.2% in the quarter before.</p>
      <p>Monday's data showed business investment held steady in the third quarter versus economists' expectations for a 0.5% fall.</p>
      <p>Household spending, which has been much more than resilient business investment, due to falling unemployment and rising wages, rose by 0.4% on the quarter while government spending increased by 0.3%.</p>
