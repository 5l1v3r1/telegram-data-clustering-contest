      <p>DARIEN, Conn. (AP) — A Connecticut man charged in the death of a hotel worker in Anguilla (ang-GWIL’-uh) has declined to return to the British Caribbean territory for the latest pretrial hearing.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Scott Hapgood says Anguillan officials have not given assurances that his client would be allowed to return home on bond.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Jamie Diaferia says there also have been death threats against Hapgood.</p>
      <p>Hapgood and his family say a hotel worker, Kenny Mitchel, showed up at their room unannounced during their April vacation, demanded money and attacked them.</p>
      <p>Mitchel died, and Hapgood was charged with manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Elected officials including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal had expressed concern about Hapgood’s safety.</p>
      <p>Diaferia says Anguilla officials rejected an offer for Hapgood to appear by video link for Monday’s hearing.</p>
