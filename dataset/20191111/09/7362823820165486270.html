      <p>Interior Ministry's spokesman Ismail Catakli also said on Monday that seven German nationals would be returned on Nov. 14. There was no immediate information on the IS suspects.</p>
      <p>Turkey has over the past weeks criticized European nations for refusing to take back their nationals. It has vowed to send back IS militants -- even if their citizenships have been revoked.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu has said that Turkey is not a hotel for IS militants and that Ankara would begin repatriating IS militants as of Monday.</p>
      <p>Soylu did not provide any numbers or say which countries they would be sent back to.</p>
