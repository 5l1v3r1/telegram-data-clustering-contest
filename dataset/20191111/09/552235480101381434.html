      <h1>St Mirren boss Jim Goodwin brands Hearts mauling as bad as any in his career as manager</h1>
      <h2>The five-goal demolition in Edinburgh leaves the Buddies sitting bottom of the Premiership table.</h2>

      <p>Jim Goodwin labelled the 5-2 mauling at the hands of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> as bad as any result he’s had as a manager.</p>
      <p>The Buddies usually solid defence went missing in the capital, as the goal-shy Jambos netted five to leap above <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> and send them bottom of the table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Goodwin</a> said his men were “a shadow” of the defensively-sound team that have taken to the pitch so far this season.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the match, he said: “Today is as bad a day as I’ve felt in my three years of being a manager.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been fortunate in that period with relative success with Alloa and being given the opportunity to come here. We’ve done OK.</p>
      <p>“We’ve received a lot of plaudits of how we’ve been defensively, being organised and the structure has been great. We’ve not been giving many away.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, today we were just a shadow of that organised team that we’ve been up until now.</p>
      <p>“Frustrated, disappointed, we’re all of those words but this is a sore one. It’ll take a few days to get over, there’s no doubt about that.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The high-scoring affair that played out at Tynecastle flew in the face of what had gone previously for both sides, with both teams struggling for goals so far this season.</p>
      <p>And even though St Mirren managed two goals in a game for just the second time this league campaign after Jon Obika and Danny Mullen had found the net, the manager was struggling to find the positives after yet another defeat on the road.</p>
      <p>He said: “Goals for has obviously been a problem. We haven’t scored enough and we can’t deny that.</p>
      <p>“We scored two good goals, particularly the first one, which was a really well-worked goal.</p>
      <p>“But it’s hard to look at the positives on that side of things just now because all we can think about really is the manner in which we’ve given away five goals.</p>
      <p>“I’ve sat here in weeks gone by and been frustrated because I’ve felt the result could have gone our way. There were games we were in where we just didn’t get the luck or the break of the ball.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But I can’t say that today. We’ve got to hold our hands up and say Hearts were the better team on the day.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m gutted for the supporters. They came through in great numbers as they always do.</p>
      <p>“I’m really disappointed for them that they’ve had to witness that. We owe them a performance.”</p>
