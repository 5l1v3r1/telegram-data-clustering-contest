      <p>TEHRAN, Nov 11 — Iran’s oil minister said today that an oil field whose discovery President Hassan Rouhani announced at the weekend adds only 22.2 billion barrels to the country’s estimated crude reserves.</p>
      <p>Out of the amount at the site, only a tenth — 2.2 billion barrels — can be extracted due to technological limitations, the minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganeh, told reporters in Tehran.</p>
      <p>Rouhani on Sunday announced the discovery of a field containing 53 billion barrels of oil in the southwestern province of Khuzestan, saying it was a “small gift by the government to the people of Iran”.</p>
      <p>The oil minister said the discovery added 22.2 billion barrels to the country’s oil reserves.</p>
      <p>“Considering that there was already 31 billion barrels of oil (in the region), the in situ amount added is 22.2 billion barrels,” he said.</p>
      <p>Due to the area’s “dense and stone material”, the amount that can be extracted is only “2.2 billion barrels, considering the current technology we have,” he added.</p>
      <p>The discovery spans 2,400 square kilometres (926 square miles), according to a map Zanganeh showed journalists.</p>
      <p>It could potentially be expanded towards to southwest and east through further exploration.</p>
      <p>The oil layer is about 3.1 kilometres (nearly two miles) deep, with an average thickness of 80 metres (yards).</p>
      <p>Iran is a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).</p>
      <p>It sits on the world’s fourth-biggest oil reserves, estimated by energy giant BP at 155.6 billion barrels of crude, and also has the second-largest gas reserves.</p>
      <p>Yet the Islamic republic has struggled to sell its oil since US President Donald Trump withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran.</p>
      <p>The remaining parties to the accord — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia — have worked to save it by finding ways to bypass US sanctions, but their efforts have so far borne little fruit. — AFP</p>
