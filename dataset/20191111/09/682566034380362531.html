      <p>Cape Town - <b>Orlando Pirates</b> interim coach <b>Rulani Mokwena</b> was left fuming after the Soweto derby on Saturday as he accused <b>Kaizer Chiefs</b> mentor <b>Ernst Middendorp</b> of encouraging "thuggish behaviour".</p>
      <p>A thrilling battle between the Soweto giants at the FNB Stadium ended with Amakhosi prevailing 3-2 but Chiefs defender Eric Mothoho was shown a straight red card close to the end of the game.</p>
      <p>The Bafana Bafana centre-back was given his marching orders after he was alleged to have shoved Abel Mabsao in the face as a scuffle broke between the two sets of players.</p>
      <p>Mokwena said after the game: "I'm extremely disappointed as a football lover that such a great spectacle is ruined by such thuggish behaviour.</p>
      <p>"It's okay to lose, okay let's lose but don't punch my players! I've got players that were kicked, punched in the face, I mean what do you say about these things. It's thuggish behaviour.</p>
      <p>"I mean how do we have such coaches that condone such behaviour and carry [out] such behaviour!?</p>
      <p>"I mean we can't have such things! Everybody is watching this, this is broadcast world wide, it's two of the biggest teams in the country and they play very good football and then we have coaches that encourages players to punch, foul and kick and be thugs on the pitch, it can't be."</p>
      <p>The victory for Chiefs mean they are now ten points clear at the top of the PSL table heading into the international break.</p>
