      <p>Oil prices fell on Monday on renewed caution over the prospects of a trade deal between the United States and China, with investors shrugging off comments over the weekend by U.S. President Donald Trump that talks were going well.</p>
      <p>LONDON: Oil prices dipped on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to downplay reports of an imminent lifting of tariffs in a protracted U.S.-Chinese trade war.</p>
      <p>Brent crude was down 87 cents at US$61.64 by 1030 GMT. The contract gained 1.3per cent last week.</p>

      <p>U.S. crude was 88 cents lower at US$56.36 a barrel, having risen 1.9per cent last week.</p>
      <p>Trump said on Saturday that trade talks with China were moving along "very nicely" but the United States would only make a deal with Beijing if it was the right one for America.</p>
      <p>Trump also said there had been incorrect reporting about U.S. willingness to lift tariffs as part of a "phase one" agreement, news of which had boosted markets.</p>
      <p>The 16-month trade war between the world's two biggest economies has slowed economic growth around the world and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand, raising concerns that a supply glut could develop in 2020.</p>
      <p>"We expect the sideward trading to continue for the time being, with the trade conflict headlines likely to dictate the direction," Commerzbank said in a note.</p>
      <p>Oil futures often trade in tandem with shares. Equities across the globe fell on Monday on escalating violence in Hong Kong. Asian stocks had their worst day since August.</p>
      <p>Underlining the impact of the trade war, data over the weekend showed that China's producer prices fell the most in more than three years in October.</p>
      <p>Auto sales in China fell for a 16th consecutive month in October, data showed on Monday.</p>
      <p>Investors are also concerned about excess supplies of crude, analysts said.</p>
      <p>The oil market outlook for next year may have upside potential, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said last week, suggesting there is no need to cut output further.</p>
      <p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia meet in early December. The so-called OPEC+ alliance has since January cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day under a deal set to last until March 2020.</p>
      <p>Lukoil , Russia's second biggest oil producer, expects the global oil production cut deal, known as OPEC+, to be extended, its chief said on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in North America, TC Energy Corp's 590,000-barrel-per-day Keystone oil pipeline has returned to service, operating at reduced pressure with a gradual increase of volumes.</p>
