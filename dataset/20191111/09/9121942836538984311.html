      <p>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — A plan by Chilean President Sebastián Piñera’s to draft a new constitution has been criticized by the opposition and even his own political ranks.</p>
      <p>The opposition said Monday that Piñera’s plan, one of a series of measures aimed at quelling weeks of protests, does not go far enough.</p>
      <p>The opposition says the process, as outlined by the president, is inadequate, partly because it relies on current legislators who are viewed with suspicion by protesters.</p>
      <p>Students in Chile began protesting nearly a month ago over a subway fare hike. The demonstrations morphed into a massive protest movement over inequality and other wide-ranging grievances.</p>
      <p>While most protests have been peaceful, at least 20 people have died in clashes between protesters and police.</p>
