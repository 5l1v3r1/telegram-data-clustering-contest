      <p>U.S. stock index futures fell on Monday as President Donald Trump's comments dampened expectations around a U.S.-China trade deal, while escalating violence in Hong Kong added to investor worries.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Wall Street's main indexes fell on Monday as comments by President Donald Trump dampened optimism around a U.S.-China trade deal, while escalating violence in Hong Kong added to investor concerns.</p>
      <p>Hopes of a "phase one" deal to end the damaging 16-month trade war and largely upbeat corporate earnings have sparked a rally that helped the three major stock indexes close at record highs on Friday.</p>

      <p>But Trump said on Saturday that the United States would only make a deal if it was the "right deal" for America, adding that the talks had moved more slowly than he would have liked.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors were lower, with the energy sector the biggest decliner.</p>
      <p>Technology shares slipped 0.2per cent and were among the biggest drags on the benchmark index due to weakness in chip makers, which get a sizeable chunk of sales from China. The trade-sensitive industrials sector also dropped 0.4per cent.</p>
      <p>Continuing violence in Hong Kong hit sentiment after police shot and wounded a protester in the 24th straight week of pro-democracy unrest in the Chinese-ruled territory.</p>
      <p>"You have China involved in two major variables now, which seems to be causing some nervousness," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville.</p>
      <p>"During times like these, the markets are going to be volatile and erratic, especially after coming off all time highs."</p>
      <p>The third-quarter earnings season is drawing to a close on a positive note, with nearly three quarters of the 446 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results so far topping profit estimates, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Attention will now shift to economic data as well as on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's testimonies later this week.</p>
      <p>At 10:13 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 97.34 points, or 0.35per cent, at 27,583.90, the S&amp;P 500 was down 9.39 points, or 0.30per cent, at 3,083.69 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.46 points, or 0.32per cent, at 8,447.85.</p>
      <p>Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc jumped 6.3per cent after Bloomberg reported KKR &amp; Co had formally approached the drugstore giant for what could be the biggest-ever leveraged buyout.</p>
      <p>Among other stocks, Qualcomm Inc fell 2.4per cent after Morgan Stanley downgraded the chipmaker to "equal-weight" from "overweight".</p>
      <p>Shares of Cisco Systems Inc dropped 1.2per cent as Piper Jaffray downgraded the network gear maker to "neutral" from "overweight".</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.62-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.56-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P index recorded 7 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 48 new lows.</p>
