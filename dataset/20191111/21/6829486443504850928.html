      <h1>“It’s Been Love”: Watch Drake Try To Keep It Together While Being Booed Offstage</h1>

      <p>By most metrics, Drake is one of the most successful rappers in the entire scene — a pop megastar without equal. But that doesn’t mean that he gets the royal treatment everywhere he goes.</p>
      <p>Case in point: this week, Drake appeared at <a href="https://junkee.com/tag/tyler-the-creator">Tyler The Creator</a>‘s Camp Flog Gnaw festival. An overwhelmingly popular two-day event that the young Odd Future star has curated for years, Camp Flog Gnaw is known for the sheer variety of headline acts — you can expect to see everyone from SZA to Earl Sweatshirt to Blood Orange.</p>

      <p>This year, Camp Flog Gnaw advertised itself as being headlined by a secret guest. In the leadup to the event, speculation ran wild as to who that might be, and quickly, one guess rose right to the top of the pile: Frank Ocean.</p>
      <p>It makes sense why crowds thought that the <i>Blonde </i>singer might be the one taking to the Flog Gnaw stage. Ocean and Tyler The Creator have been friends for many years — <a href="https://www.fuse.tv/2013/03/tyler-the-creator-frank-ocean-gay-pop-tarts">Tyler has one of the most memorable quotes about Ocean’s coming out</a> — and the former artist is <a href="https://twitter.com/lou_kicks/status/1192164487584894976">apparently slowly gearing up for the release of a new record.</a></p>
      <p>So, picture the scene: there stand thousands of rap fans, thrumming with energy and excitement, ready to see Ocean, when all of a sudden who takes to the stage but… Drake.</p>
      <p>Yep, the secret headline wasn’t hip hop’s most vulnerable crooner, but its biggest popstar.</p>
      <p>And fans were not happy.</p>
      <p>In fact, they were so unhappy that Drake was eventually forced to ask if the crowd wanted him to continue.</p>
      <p>“I’m here for you tonight,” the Toronto popstar told the crowd. “If you want to keep going, I will keep going. What’s up?”</p>
      <p>The answer, emphatically, was no. And so Drake took his leave, 20 minutes before his set should have finished.</p>
      <p>The video is, predictably, very hard to watch:</p>

      <p>In the hours since the event went viral, Tyler The Creator has waded into the whole mess, calling the event an example of “mob mentality” and “cancel culture” in real life, while acknowledging that he might have misread the room.</p>
