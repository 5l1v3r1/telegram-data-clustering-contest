      <p>Yeehaw, cowgirl.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/charli-xcx">Charli XCX</a> stars in Agent Provocateur’s new Christmas campaign and look book, dressed up as a sexy rodeo queen.</p>
      <p>The images are meant to “pay homage to country-western and the Deep South with a Rhinestone Rodeo,” with the 27-year-old pop star clad in a number of racy lingerie sets accessorized with bedazzled gloves, cowboy hats, lassos and bucking broncos, of course.</p>

      <p>In a press release announcing the partnership, the “Boys” singer gushed, “Being a part of AP’s Xmas campaign was iconic! Nothing says Christmas like naughty and nice with a dash of cowgirl. I love all these pieces so much and this whole shoot day was so wild… so fun, it was a pleasure to work with such a legendary brand.”</p>

      <p>“I’ve always been a huge fan of Charli’s and we couldn’t imagine anyone better to collaborate with to become our Agent Provocateur Rodeo Queen – she was a natural!,” creative director Sarah Shotton explained. “We wanted to bring some cheeky AP fun and sexiness to the holiday season.”</p>
