      <p><b>HONG KONGÂ (AP)</b> - The Latest on Hong Kong protests (all times local):</p>
      <p>6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's leader says her administration will "spare no effort" in bringing an end to anti-government protests that have wracked the city for more than five months.</p>
      <p>Carrie Lam spoke to reporters Monday during a day of spiraling violence that included the shooting by police of an unarmed protester and the setting on fire of a man during an argument over national identity.</p>
      <p>Lam said she did not want to go into details, but her comments are likely to fuel speculation that harsher legal and police measures may be in the works.</p>
      <p>Lam also said there would be no giving way to protesters' demands for political concessions.</p>
      <p>"If there is still any wishful thinking that, by escalating violence, the Hong Kong SAR government will yield to pressure to satisfy the so-called political demands, I am making this statement clear and loud here: That will not happen," Lam said, using the initials for Special Administrative Region, which describes the city's status as a semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>3:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>A man has been set on fire following an apparent dispute over national identity in Hong Kong, where police shot a protester on a day of escalating violence.</p>
      <p>The man set on fire around midday was in critical condition in a city hospital. Video posted online show him arguing with a group of young people, before someone douses him with a liquid and strikes a lighter.</p>
      <p>The police shooting was also captured on video Monday as demonstrators blocked train lines and roads during the morning commute to push their demands for democratic reforms. The Hong Kong hospital authority said the person shot was in critical condition.</p>
      <p>The violence is likely to further inflame passions after a student died Friday from injuries suffered in an earlier fall and police arrested six pro-democracy lawmakers over the weekend.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>10 a.m.</p>
      <p>A video posted online in Hong Kong shows police shooting at least one protester as demonstrators disrupted the morning rush hour.</p>
      <p>A police officer collars one protester and then shoots another who approaches in the video posted on Facebook on Monday by online video outlet Cupid Producer.</p>
      <p>The shooting occurred in a crosswalk at a large intersection strewn with debris that had backed-up traffic.</p>
      <p>The officer also fires at a third protester who approached. It was unclear if the protester was hit.</p>
