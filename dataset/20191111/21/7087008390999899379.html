      <h1>Royal Bank of Canada Looking Into Launching Bitcoin Trading Platform</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T21:49:02+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">George Georgiev</a></address>
      <p>The Royal Bank of Canada is reportedly exploring a cryptocurrency trading platform for in-store and online purchases, as well as for investments. Moreover, the bank is also supposedly looking into allowing customers to open bank accounts that contain digital currencies.</p>
      <h3>Royal Bank of Canada Explores Bitcoin Trading Platform</h3>
      <p>In what looks like a serious step forward in terms of cryptocurrency adoption, the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) is <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/rbc-exploring-cryptocurrency-trading-platform-for-investments-and-online-purchases/">reportedly</a> exploring launching a trading platform for investments which would include Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital currencies.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the bank is also looking into the opportunity of allowing its customers to open bank accounts that contain cryptocurrencies. RBC would be the very first bank in Canada to launch a cryptocurrency exchange or to offer accounts containing digital currencies.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the matter was Marc Kaufman, a lawyer from a Washington-based firm, who outlined:</p>
      <blockquote>“I can’t think of one of the big banks anywhere in the world that has a patent that directly relates to a crypto exchange.”</blockquote>
      <p>This wouldn’t be the bank’s first foray into the field of cryptocurrencies as back in 2017, RBC <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-rbc-blockchain/exclusive-royal-bank-of-canada-using-blockchain-for-u-s-canada-payments-executive-idUSKCN1C237N">announced</a> that it uses blockchain-based technology to move payments to American banks. Later on, the bank also disclosed that it was using the technology to verify the identities of its clients.</p>
      <h3>A Solution Much Needed?</h3>
      <p>Those who follow the cryptocurrency scene might have heard of the QuadrigaX scandal which took part in late 2018 and early 2019 when the CEO of the popular Canada-based exchange, Gerald Cotten, found his death in India.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, it was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/quadrigacx-190-m-loss-could-turn-into-theft-following-its-litecoin-sudden-move/">reported</a> that Gerald Cotten was the only person who had access to the cold storage of the cryptocurrency exchange and, as such, the latter owed its clients roughly around $190 million.</p>
      <p>Issues of the kind are among the main challenges that the nascent field of digital currencies needs to overcome to make adoption a plausible option.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, a huge banking institution such as the Royal Bank of Canada and its ventures into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, certainly look like a step in the right direction.</p>
