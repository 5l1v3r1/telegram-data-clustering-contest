      <h1>Bride upset friend skipped reception to go to grandma's funeral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T21:28:43+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 21:28</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Hollan</a></address>
      <p>A woman who shared her story on Reddit did not get the response she was hoping for.</p>
      <p>Normally, when the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/weddings">maid of honor</a> quits a week before the wedding, some might judge her to be rude.</p>
      <p>But what if there's a death in the family? While the bride was OK with her friend missing the ceremony for a funeral, she seemed upset that the reception was skipped as well.</p>

      <p>The post appeared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/dsuw72/shes_angry_that_her_friend_didnt_come_to_the/">Reddit’s forums</a>, where the author explained that she got married two years ago on a Friday the 13th in October. Her maid of honor was her old college roommate Annie.</p>
      <p>The bride wrote: “Two weeks before my wedding, a different bridesmaid had to drop out due to taking finals she couldn't miss. That was fine, I had another friend I asked and he accepted. Then, less than a week before the wedding, my friend Annie dropped out of the wedding because her grandmother died and the memorial was the same day a couple of hours earlier. (I found it weird they had it on Friday the 13th since her family is SUPER religious, but c'est la vie).”</p>

      <p>This is where the story starts to get strange. The author continued: “I completely understood her need to be there and know it was NOT her fault. I asked if she could try and make the reception at least, and she said she couldn't. I'll admit, I was really sad, but I got over it. However, after that, I didn't hear from her for some time. She never apologized and never initiated text conversations.”</p>
      <p>A year-and-a-half later, Annie got married. According to the post, “While I was invited to the wedding, I wasn't part of her bridal party. I decided to forgo the wedding as I knew I would just bring negative energy and didn't want to ruin her day. At this point, we hadn't spoken since MY wedding.”</p>

      <p>She concluded her post, “I want to reiterate that I am not mad at her for missing my wedding, I am hurt that she didn't make an effort to come to my reception and that she never reached out to me afterward.”</p>

      <p>Her post did not get the response she was hoping fo, thoughr. One user commented: “This lady is nuts. She makes a whole post about being hurt because the friend had to miss her wedding for a funeral. Then when everyone tells her she’s wrong, she refuses to accept it.”</p>
      <p>Another user added, “She sounds like one of those people who turn everything into a 'poor me' thing.”</p>
      <p>Others couldn’t believe that she couldn’t forgive her friend, with one posting: “She's basically still a jerk for saying that she wasn't ever going to forgive her friend. Feeling hurt and sad is one thing, but the lack of forgiveness is definitely wrong.”</p>

      <p>In an update, the original author returned to say that even though the majority of responses said she was wrong, she hadn't changed her own opinion on the matter:  Feelings are more complicated than Reddit seems to comprehend.”</p>
