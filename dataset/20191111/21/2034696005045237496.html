      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> looks to be teasing a new <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/ariana-grande-sweetener-review">‘Sweetener’</a> live album on her Instagram.</p>
      <p>The album came out last August, and was followed by another LP – <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-review-2">‘Thank U, Next’</a> in February.</p>

      <p>The new teasers follow a recent hint from Grande that a live album could be on the way. Last month, she tweeted: “so …. i got a bunch of my live vocals from tour on my laptop thanks to johnny and toby</p>
      <p>“about to start comping thru and picking my favorite adlibs / performance moments on this flight … just in case u want a live album one day.”</p>

      <p>The ‘Sweetener’ world tour kicked off in Los Angeles at the STAPLES Centre back in May.</p>
      <p>In a review of the first show of the tour, <i>NME</i>‘s Rhian Daly wrote: “By the time last year’s smash hit ‘Thank U, Next’ arrives, signalling the end of the show, Grande looks like she’s having a blast, skipping around the runway with her dancers both with and without her <i>First Wives Club</i> white blazer shrugged over her shoulders.</p>
      <p>“Where she goes from here is still unknown but, as tonight shows, she’s got a habit of exceeding herself.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, she shared her <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/listen-to-ariana-grandes-star-studded-charlies-angels-album-2563374">star-studded new soundtrack for the new <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> film</a>.</p>
