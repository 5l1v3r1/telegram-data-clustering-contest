        <b>Midfielder Robbie Benson has announced his departure from Dundalk FC.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Athlone native played and scored in <a href="https://www.dundalkdemocrat.ie/news/sport/493158/dundalk-fc-devour-linfield-to-win-the-unite-the-union-champions-cup.html">tonight's Unite the Union Champions Cup second leg</a> trouncing of Linfield at Oriel Park, going off to a standing ovation midway through the second period.</p>
      <p>He was seen embracing all members of the Lilywhites bench and confirmed afterwards that he is leaving after four seasons with the club.</p>
      <p>"There is no point in denying it now," he told RTÉ Sport.</p>

      <p>"It would be kind of insulting to people to say otherwise, but tonight was my last game for the club.</p>
      <p>"I've been very successful here over the last four years and I'd just like to say thanks to everyone - staff and players - that have been with me, and the fans as well.</p>
      <p>"I just feel it's the right time for me to move on in search of a new challenge."</p>
      <p>St. Patrick's Athletic is believed to be his destination, where he will work under former team-mate Stephen O'Donnell, but Benson stopped short of confirming that.</p>
      <p>"It's not fair of me to say anything; there's nothing decided yet, officially.</p>
      <p>"Tonight's about my last game with Dundalk, I've enjoyed my time here and am very grateful for all the success we've had."</p>
