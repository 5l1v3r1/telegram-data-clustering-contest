      <h1>GAA Central Council set to fine-tune new rules</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T21:24:06+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 21:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/john-fogarty/" target="_blank">By John Fogarty</a></address>
      <p>The small print of Gaelic football’s new playing rules will be determined at Central Council on Saturday week.</p>
      <p>The finer points of the sin bin, kick-out, and advanced mark rules have to be decided. For instance, it has not yet been agreed if a goalkeeper who is sent to the line for 10 minutes can be replaced by a substitute goalkeeper, with an outfield player making way for that period.</p>
      <p>“We have a couple of things we need to get clarified, such as if a goalkeeper can come on for an outfield player and then goes back off again,” said the GAA’s national match official manager Donal Smith.</p>
      <blockquote>“Is that an extra sub then? It becomes a real issue then, but things like that will be put to Central Council and we will take it from there.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s envisaged that if a player is sin-binned before half time, they will remain sidelined for the remainder of the 10 minutes at the start of the second half.</p>
      <p>Should a player be sin-binned close to the end of normal time in a game that goes to extra time, it is also expected that they will sit out what is left of their sin-bin time in that first-half period of extra time.</p>
      <p>As a way of ensuring the integrity of the sin bin clock, Smith would like to see it start only when play has recommenced following a player being shown a black card.</p>
      <p>“Say you are going for a goal, I pull you down and you get injured, and treatment takes five minutes,” he said.</p>
      <blockquote>“Next thing you know, half of the sin-bin time has elapsed. I would hope that the sin bin doesn’t start until the referee restarts the game.”</blockquote>
      <p>It also has yet to be confirmed whether a kick-out mark is considered a set play as an advanced mark can only be claimed from open play.</p>
