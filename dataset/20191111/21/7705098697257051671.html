      <p>There are only three episodes left in the second season of DC Universe’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/titans"><b>Titans</b></a> original series. However, the streaming service isn’t wasting any time preparing for next season. Via twitter, DC Universe has announced that <b>Titans</b> has been renewed for a third season. Additionally, <b>Titans</b> season 3 will hit in fall 2020. But it’s also unclear if the series will be shared with HBO Max like the recently renewed <b>Doom Patrol</b>.</p>
