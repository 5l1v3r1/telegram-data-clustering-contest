      <p>For a limited time, you can get <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">a month free</a> of Philo. Typically, the free trial is limited to a week, but right now, you can get your first month free. Which is a $20 value.</p>
      <p>To do so, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7692744/type/dlg/https://www.philo.com/login/subscribe">just click here</a>, and you should see the coupon automatically applied. Just enter your phone number or email address to sign up, and you'll be good to go.</p>
      <p>Philo is a lesser known streaming TV service. And that's because it mostly has Viacom channels – channels that aren't available on most other streaming TV services. With Philo, you're getting Live and on-demand TV with unlimited recording. Which sounds like a really good deal, especially since you are getting 58 channels for just $20 per month.</p>

      <p>There really aren't any catches either. As you also get ten profiles with Philo (which is pretty insane actually), as well as the ability to watch it on virtually any platform including the web, and you can stream on up to three devices at the same time. Philo is available on Android, Android TV, iOS, Roku, Fire TV and Apple TV. As well as through your web browser.</p>
      <p>Some of the channels that are available on Philo include AMC, Animal Planet, BBC: America, BBC: World News, BET, Comedy Central, Cooking Channel, Food Network, FYI, Hallmark Channel, History Channel, OWN, TLC, Viceland and many more.</p>
      <p>Now, with Philo, you aren't getting a lot of your other popular channels like CNN, ESPN, or your locals. But at $20 per month, this is a good add-on for something like Sling TV or YouTube TV. But you'll just have to remember which service has which channels, when you're looking to watch something specific.</p>
