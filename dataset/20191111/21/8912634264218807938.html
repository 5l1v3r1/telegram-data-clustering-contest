      <p>QAMISHLI, Syria: Three simultaneous bombings killed at least six civilians in the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in northeastern Syria on Monday, a Kurdish security source and a Britain-based monitor said.<br/>There was no immediate claim for the bombings, but they occurred shortly after the Daesh group said it was responsible for the killing the same day of a priest from the same city.<br/>In Qamishli, an AFP correspondent saw charred cars and smoke rise from the site of the blasts.<br/>Firefighters tried to put out the flames caused by the explosions, as rescue workers carried away the victims.<br/>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, which relies on sources inside Syria, said two car bombs and an explosives-rigged motorcycle blew up in a market and near a school in the city.<br/>More than 20 people were wounded in the simultaneous attacks, said the Britain-based monitor said.<br/>The blasts come after Daesh claimed to have killed an Armenian Catholic priest from Qamishli.<br/>The Observatory said the priest and his father were killed by gunfire as they made their way to the eastern province of Deir Ezzor to inspect the restoration of a church there.<br/>Kurdish fighters have led the US-backed battle against Daesh in Syria, expelling the extremists from the last scrap of their proto-state in March.<br/>But the jihadists have continued to claim deadly attacks in northeastern and eastern Syria ever since.<br/>In July, IS said it was responsible for a massive truck bomb that killed at least 44 people in Qamishli.<br/>A Turkish cross-border attack against Kurdish fighters on Oct. 9 heightened fears that Daesh fighters could break out in mass from Kurdish jails.<br/>But a fragile Turkish-Russian cease-fire deal has more or less halted that offensive, and seen Kurdish forces withdraw from areas along the Turkish border, except Qamishli.</p>
