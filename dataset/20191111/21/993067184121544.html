      <p>The Australian singer was radiant in a high-necked, floor-length dress, which featured a bold pattern of red flowers and a black belt.</p>

      <p>Clarke looked stunning in a black dress with ruffled sleeves, and a bare section on the front.</p>
      <p>The actress wore her hair pulled back to showcase the outfit’s neckline.</p>
      <p>Dame Emma wrapped up against the cold, looking cosy in a white top and a blue coat and trousers. Getting into the festive spirit, she wore stars in her hair.</p>
