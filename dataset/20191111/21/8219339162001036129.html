      <h1>Looking for the best Disney+ deal? Check out these bundles, promos, and more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T21:16:31+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 21:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Ready to sign up for the highly anticipated Disney+ streaming service but aren’t sure which plan is the best option? Read on for how to find the best Disney+ deal as we cover promos and bundles compared to the basic subscription plan options.</p>
      <p>Disney+ launches on November 12 with new original content like <i>The Mandalorian </i>as well as its massive catalog of popular movies and shows that includes <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/disney/">Disney</a>, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and even National Geographic content.</p>
      <p>Customers can sign up for the basic Disney+ streaming plan that costs $7/month now, but there’s likely a better option for you between a special one-year free promo, Hulu/ESPN+ bundle, and a discount on paying yearly. Follow along below to find the best deal for you.</p>
      <h3>How to get the best Disney+ deal: promo, bundle option, more</h3>
      <h4>Free year of Disney+</h4>
      <p>Disney offered D23 members a special promotion to buy two years of Disney+ and get one free back in September. That <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/28/disney-plus-discount/">promo isn’t available anymore</a>, but there is good news for Verizon customers. The carrier has partnered with Disney to give “all new and existing 4G LTE and 5G unlimited wireless customers” a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/22/disney-video-service-matches-apple-tv-free-year-promo-through-verizon/">free year of the service</a>.</p>
      <p>Verizon is also offering the deal to “New Verizon Fios Home Internet and 5G Home Internet customers.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Verizon customers can <b><a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/disneyplus/">head to this page to claim your free year</a></b> of Disney+.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you happened to get the D23 three-year deal and also are a Verizon customer, the carrier has said that it will be possible to still use the free year first, then resume the three-year prepaid subscription.</p>
      <h4>Bundle option</h4>
      <p>Another choice that will be appealing to many customers is the bundle option to get Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ for just $13/month. That’s just $6 more than the price of Disney+ on its own (and $5 less than buying them all separate).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>
            <a href="https://preview.disneyplus.com/">Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ bundle</a>
          </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Monthly vs. yearly pricing and free trial</h4>
      <p>At the time of writing, Disney is offering customers a free seven-day trial for the service. After that, it runs <a href="https://founders.disneyplus.com/sign-up?redemptionCode=DISNEY-PRESALE-MONTH">$7/month or $70/year</a>. The yearly price breaks down to be $5.83/month, saving customers $14 compared to paying monthly over the same period.</p>
      <h4>Disney+ app</h4>
      <p>Don’t forget to grab the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/disney/id1446075923?l=en">Disney+ app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV</a>.
