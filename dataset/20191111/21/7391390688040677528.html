      <p>If you're a <i>Star Wars</i> fan, you should have no problem diving right into the universe of new <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mandalorian-disney-plus-star-wars-timeline-time-line-canon-chronology-1471021">Disney+ series <i>The Mandalorian</i></a>, which picks up roughly five years after 1983's <i>Return of the Jedi </i>and 25 years before 2015's <i>The Force Awakens. </i>But even if you've never seen a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-new-star-wars-series-the-mandalorian-cast-was-revealed-with-pedro-pascal-in-the-title-role-15517624"><i>Star Wars </i>movie, you can still watch <i>The Mandalorian</i></a><i> </i>without having trouble keeping up. As showrunner Jon Favreau told <i>The Los Angeles Times, </i>"It's an invitation<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2019-11-08/disney-plus-star-wars-the-mandalorian-jon-favreau-novices"> into [<i>Star Wars</i>] </a>in a very pure way. It's the first time since <i>Episode IV </i>where it's inviting people into a whole new cast of characters that doesn't require any prerequisite understanding of the world."</p>
      <p>There is, however, a huge, giant, unavoidable caveat to the idea of watching<i> The Mandalorian</i> without having seen the <i>Star Wars </i>movies: you <i>should</i> watch them anyway. Doing so will only enhance your <i>Mandalorian</i> viewing experience, and hey, if you like the show, you'd probably like the immensely popular franchise that pre-empted its existence, too.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/the-mandalorian">official description of the show</a> puts this into perspective:</p>
      <blockquote>"After the stories of Jango and Boba Fett, another warrior emerges in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. <i>The Mandalorian</i> is set after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order. We follow the travails of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic."</blockquote>
      <p>You see, anyone could follow a story about a lone gunfighter on a fictional planet, but it would be even better with context. Without the <i>Star Wars</i> movies, "Jango and Boba Fett," "the fall of the Empire," and "the emergence of the First Order" are all totally meaningless. Watching the <i>Star Wars</i> films (or at least the original trilogy and reading summaries of the prequels, if you must) will show how <i>The Mandalorian</i> fits into the bigger picture and allow you to understand more of the references. (How else are you supposed to know the true significance of people being frozen in carbonite?)</p>

      <p>But if you don't want to do that, to put it into the most basic terms, <i>The Mandalorian </i>takes place after Darth Vader was taken down (surely <i>everyone</i> knows Darth Vader), but a couple of decades before the stuff happening in the current trilogy. The show doesn't directly involve any characters from any of the movies.</p>
      <p>Setting <i>The Mandalorian</i> even further apart from the<i> Star Wars</i> film franchise is the fact that "Mandalorians" — people from the planet Mandalore — aren't mentioned in the films. Instead, they come from the <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/mandalorian-star-wars-series-66863643"><i>Star Wars </i>expanded universe,</a> which includes books and comics not considered canon. The character Jango Fett — who is featured in <i>Episode II — Attack of the Clones —</i> has been established as a Mandalorian, and his "son" Boba Fett, who's featured in the original trilogy, is associated with the group, too. (However, because Boba is actually a clone, he's not technically a Mandalorian, and as CNET notes, Jango is <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/the-mandalorian-everything-we-know-about-the-new-star-wars-show-on-disney-plus/">not always considered a Mandalorian</a>, either. It's complicated.)</p>
      <p>If this is all still sort of confusing for you, then that's reason enough to watch the <i>Star Wars</i> movies before watching <i>The Mandalorian</i> to get a better understanding of the galaxy we're working with. Otherwise, jump right in, but just know that a few things may go over your head.</p>
