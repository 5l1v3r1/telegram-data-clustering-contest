      <p>Ibraheem Yazeed, who was captured by U.S. Marshals in Florida last week and charged with kidnapping Aniah Blanchard – the stepdaughter of UFC heavyweight Walt Harris – has been returned to Alabama and jailed in Lee County without bond, <a href="https://www.wsfa.com/2019/11/10/suspect-aniah-blanchard-disappearance-brought-back-lee-county/">according to <i>WSFA 12 News</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Blanchard, 19, and Yazeed, 30, were seen on security video in the same Auburn, AL convenience store on the evening of October 23rd. Blanchard’s friends and family have not heard from her since then. Blanchard’s vehicle, which had been damaged, was located on October 25th.</p>
      <p>Before he was apprehended and charged with kidnapping last week, Yazeed had been free on a $280,000 bond and was awaiting trial over unrelated charges of kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder. The incident those charges are connected to happened in January and, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/11/aniah-blanchard-kidnapping-suspect-ibraheem-yazeed-captured-by-us-marshals-in-pensacola.html">according to <i>AL.com</i></a>, resulted in the ‘near death’ of a 77-year-old man.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsfa.com/2019/11/08/affidavit-aniah-blanchards-blood-found-suv-witness-saw-her-abduction/">According to<i> WSFA 12</i></a><i> </i>a probable cause affidavit states that a witness saw Yazeed force Blanchard into her vehicle against her will. The witness said that Yazeed and Blanchard drove away together in that vehicle.</p>
      <p>The affidavit also revealed that blood evidence, found in the passenger compartment of Blanchard’s vehicle, “was indicative of someone suffering a life-threatening injury.”</p>
      <p>The search for Blanchard, who is from Homewood, AL and is a student at Southern Union Community College near Auburn, is ongoing. <a href="https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/2019/11/natalee-holloways-mother-joins-search-for-aniah-blanchard.html">This weekend it was reported </a>that speech pathologist and noted motivational speaker Beth Holloway had joined Texas EquuSearch group in looking for Blanchard.</p>
      <p>Holloway’s 18-year-old daughter Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30th, 2005 while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. Natalee Holloway, who lived in Mountain Brook, AL, was declared deceased on January 12th, 2012.</p>
