      <h1>Origin Access subscribers won’t get to play Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order early</h1>

        <b>Ahead of the game’s launch on November 15th, Origin has revealed that Origin Access members won’t get early access to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-targets-60fps-on-enhanced-consoles/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> in order to “reduce the risk of spoilers.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s not to say that Origin Access members won’t get anything, though. Origin Access Basic subscribers can get 10% off the game while Origin Access Premier subscribers will have the Deluxe Edition included in their membership. All Origin Access members will also get some exclusive in-game cosmetics.</p>

        <i>A galaxy-spanning adventure awaits in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order™, a new third-person action-adventure title from Respawn Entertainment. This narratively-driven single player game puts you in the role of a Jedi Padawan who narrowly escaped the purge of Order 66 following the events of Star Wars™: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith™. On a quest to rebuild the Jedi Order, you must pick up the pieces of your shattered past to complete your training, develop new powerful Force abilities, and master the art of the iconic lightsaber – all while staying one step ahead of the Empire and its deadly Inquisitors.</i>
