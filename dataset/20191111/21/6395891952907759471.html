      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Finding affordable housing in Boston can seem nearly impossible. </p>
      <p>The last time Massachusetts had a comprehensive guide to affordable housing units for rent was in 1986. Michael Dukakis was governor and of course, it was not online, it was in a book.</p>
      <p>Now 33 years later, a group of nonprofits is ready to change that.</p>
      <p>It may look like just a website, but Jennifer Gilbert says it's filling a massive void in the state. Currently, you can't find affordable unit listings in one spot, like Apartments.com or Redfin. </p>
      <p>"It's totally shocking, I know people are often surprised. One of the things I spend a lot of time doing is convincing people that this tool does not already exist," said Gilbert, Executive Director of the Kuehn Foundation and President of the "Housing Navigator."</p>
      <p>The tool, "<a href="https://www.kuehncharitable.org/housing-navigator/">the Housing Navigator</a>" will be a one-stop-shop for affordable housing listings where renters can search the state's entire inventory, as well as learn about local lotteries. </p>
      <p>"I think we're all aware there's not enough affordable housing in the Greater Boston area," said Gibert.</p>
      <p>They hope to roll out the website by next fall. It will be compatible with smartphones and will also have an eligibility calculator. </p>
      <p>"One of the things we heard very much from the renter's side was this needs to be mobile-friendly," said Gilbert. "In Boston, a family of four would be eligible all the way up to over $118,000 a year of income — and I think sometimes people are surprised by that."</p>
      <p>In an era where we can find almost everything online, it might seem like such a simple solution to a widespread problem. So, what took so long?</p>
      <p>"What took so long is I think it's hard to collect all the data. You know, a great thing Mass. does is support affordable housing in a lot of different ways and in a lot of different communities but there's not one place that funds it all, so the way that you put together a site like this is you've gotta go figure out first of all - where it all is," said Gilbert. </p>
