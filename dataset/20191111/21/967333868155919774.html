      <p>​Chicago is not the only city facing hazardous winter weather.</p>

      <p>​“The coldest surge of arctic air so far this season will bring widespread record low temperatures for much of the central and eastern US even down to the Gulf Coast. Accumulating snow is expected to impact areas from the Great Lakes to northern New England,” the <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/hpcdiscussions.php?disc=pmdspd">US National Weather Service (NWS)</a> warned Monday, also noting that the freezing temperatures, which are forecast all the way down to the central Texas coast, will “make it feel like in the middle of winter rather than in November for much or the eastern two-thirds of the country for the next few days.”</p>
