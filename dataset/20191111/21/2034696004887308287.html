      <p>‘Yo Love’ follows a recent pair of tracks from Staples shared alongside his new web TV show. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-vince-staples-show-new-episode-song-so-what-2540971"><i>The Vince Staples Show</i>’</a> debuted back in August, and its first episode also saw the rapper share a new song called ‘So What?’.</p>
      <p>At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/vince-staples-show-new-song-sheet-music-second-episode-2563359">the second episode of the series dropped and was duly joined by a new track</a> too – both the episode and song are named ‘Sheet Music’.</p>
      <p>The tracks are the California rapper’s first releases since his <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/vince-staples-fm-review">2018 album, ‘FM!’</a></p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/vince-staples-fm-review">a four-star <i>NME</i> review of ‘FM!’</a>, Dhruva Balram called the album “a compelling reminder that life isn’t always sunny.”</p>
      <p>The review continues: “One of hip-hop’s most iconic characters, Staples has set himself apart from his peers numerous times before. He makes whatever the fuck he wants and ‘FM!’ is just another example of that.</p>
      <p>“Each idea is significantly different from the last and this latest album is an immersive look at the grizzly realities of millions, a notion he re-iterates on the album’s final lines:<i> “Tryna get rich, get everybody fed / But everybody dead”.”</i></p>
