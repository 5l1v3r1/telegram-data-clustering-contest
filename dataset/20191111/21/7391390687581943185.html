      <p>Droids in the <i>Star Wars </i>universe are some of the most beloved characters and Disney+'s <i>The Mandalorian</i> may be introducing a new fan-favorite. The bounty hunter droid <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/disneys-the-mandalorian-first-look-photos-introduces-a-new-crew-of-star-wars-characters-17036387">IG-11 in <i>The Mandalorian</i></a> doesn't have a very endearing job. But the new character connects back to the original films since he is the same type of model as the bounty hunter IG-88 from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. IG-11 will also bring some levity to the new Star Wars series since New Zealand filmmaker and performer Taika Waititi provides the voice. If Waititi channels his comedy — like his performance as Korg in that <i>other</i> Disney property, Marvel's <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i> (which Waititi directed) — IG-11 is guaranteed to get some laughs when the first episode of <i>The Mandalorian</i> premieres on Disney+ on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>When it comes to notoriety or screentime, IG-88 from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> was no C-3PO. He briefly appeared in a scene with other bounty hunters (including Boba Fett) where Darth Vader was ordering them to find the Millennium Falcon. Yet, this droid's legend grew as <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/IG-88">IG-88 has appeared in animated series</a>, video games, and graphic novels. He even received his own backstory in the anthology collection <i>Tales of the Bounty Hunters</i> called <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Therefore_I_Am:_The_Tale_of_IG-88">"Therefore I Am: The Tale of IG-88,"</a> which outlines how the IG-88 droids were built to be the ultimate assassins — and <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/ig-11">IG-11 is an earlier model</a> of this deadly droid.</p>

      <p>Not all of the backstory of IG-88 is canon with some of it coming from the expanded universe called <i>Star Wars Legends</i>. But Waititi, who also directed <i>The Mandalorian</i> Season 1 finale, confirmed to the <i>Star Wars Show</i> at the D23 Expo that <a href="https://www.starwars.com/video/we-talk-to-the-cast-of-the-mandalorian">his IG-11 is related</a> to the original character. "I like to think he's made in the same factory as IG-88," Waititi said. Since he's number 11 while the movie character was 88, Waititi also explained how his character is more of a classic IG model by using a car analogy. "The later Trans-Ams were kinda cool, but the earlier Trans-Ams were like, those are the ones you want. You know? You want the <i><i>Smokey and the Bandit</i></i> one, that's what IG-11 is," he said.</p>
      <p>Yet, when creator <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Br0RONGBpv6/">Jon Favreau first teased an image of IG-11</a> on Instagram, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2464123/star-wars-the-mandalorian-just-showed-off-ig-88-and-the-droid-looks-awesome">many outlets believed it was IG-88</a> and were excited by the character's grand return. But executive producer Dave Filoni, who worked on the Legends animated series <i>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</i>, explained to IGN why <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/01/the-mandalorian-ig-11-ig-88-taika-waititi-droid-assassin-dave-filoni-star-wars-disney-plus">he didn't bring back IG-88</a> and opted for a new character. "If you know the Expanded Universe and the <i>Star Wars </i>history, there are a lot of stories around [IG-88] or what might've happened to that particular droid," Filoni said. So rather than contradict the already-established history, "It's better just to say, 'Well, there's other droids,' it's not like it was a unique assassin droid.'"</p>

      <p>While you have to be a pretty devoted<i> Star Wars </i>viewer to know all about the history of IG-88, he will come up in <i>The Mandalorian</i>. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> reported that <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/08/25/the-mandalorian-character-details/">IG-11 is often mistaken for IG-88</a> in the Disney+ series. But something that will undoubtedly set them apart is the voice acting work of Waititi. In an interview with <i>EW</i>, Waititi said <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/05/inside-the-mandalorian-star-wars/">the tone of IG-11's voice</a> is between Siri and HAL 9000 from <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. He also confirmed that IG-11 won't simply be a ruthless robotic killer. "[IG-11 is] very innocent and naive and direct and doesn't know about sarcasm and doesn't know how to lie," Waititi said. "It's like a child with a gun." Quite a fitting character to be played by <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/every-hilarious-thing-jojo-rabbit-director-taika-waititi-has-said-about-playing-hitler-19215870">the director and star of the satire</a> aimed at Nazis and the Hitler Youth, <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>.</p>
      <p>Knowing Waititi's work behind and in front of the camera in projects like <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>, <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>, and <i>What We Do in the Shadows</i>, this New Zealander is bound to make this assassin droid as lovable as possible. After all, as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1iVE9OntbG/">Waititi wrote in an Instagram post</a> sharing <i>The Mandalorian</i> trailer, "Bounty hunting is a complicated profession." So while bounty hunters like Boba Fett and the Mandalorian sometimes leave fans with complicated feelings due to their cruel profession, at least IG-11 will leave you laughing as well.</p>
