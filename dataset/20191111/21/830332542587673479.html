      <p>MADISON – Edith S. Jacobson, age 62, passed peacefully, surrounded by family, friends and most importantly love on Friday November 8, 2019.  </p>
      <p>Edy was born on March 12, 1957 in Waukesha, WI to Wayne and VernaBell Scheiwe.  She grew up in Waukesha and later moved to Madison where she attended East High School and met the love of her life Jeff.  Edy married Jeffrey Jacobson on June 27, 1981.  She enjoyed coffee, the beach, her pets, Capitolaires, Disney, and loved her Facebook Black Bear family.  She loved visiting with family and friends, especially bragging about her children and grandchildren.  Family and friends have always been so very important to Edy.  The two are synonymous.  To be a friend is to be family.  You always knew you were loved by Edy.</p>
