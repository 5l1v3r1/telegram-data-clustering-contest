      <h1>Analyst Claims $8,700 Marks Good Long Opportunity for Bitcoin Despite Overnight Plunge</h1>

      <p>After surging towards $9,300 yesterday, Bitcoin’s bulls have once again surrendered to bears, leading BTC to plummet back below its key support level at $9,000. This overnight movement has once again led the cryptocurrency back down to its previous support level at $8,700, and it is showing few signs of having any strength at the moment.</p>
      <p>Analysts are now noting that $8,700 could be an ideal region for traders to enter fresh longs, but that a decisive break below this level could spark a sharp selloff that sends BTC towards $8,100.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Plummets Below $9,000 After Fleeting Bullish Movement</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/06/01/bitcoin-btc-reclaiming-8700-sets-stage-for-instrumental-push-to-9000/">Bitcoin</a> is trading down over 1% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $8,740, which marks a notable drop from its daily highs of over $9,300 that were briefly touched during the fleeting rally that occurred yesterday.</p>
      <p>The inability for Bitcoin’s bulls to maintain the upwards <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/11/facebooks-crypto-boss-is-surprisingly-bullish-on-bitcoin/">momentum</a> that was incurred yesterday points to an underlying weakness amongst buyers and may mean that further losses are imminent.</p>
      <p>The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, explained that the rejection at $9,300 that occurred yesterday was the result of BTC hitting the upper boundary of the descending pennant that it is currently trading within.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC: And there is the rejection!” She said while pointing to chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <h3>Analyst: BTC May Be Positioned for Further Gains if it Holds Above $8,700 </h3>
      <p>Regardless of BTC’s rejection at $9,300 yesterday, it is important to note that $8,700 appears to be a strong level of support that could bolster the cryptocurrency’s price action in the near-term.</p>
      <p>Loma, another poplar <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/30/as-bitcoin-price-drops-to-9k-here-are-the-targets-traders-are-watching/">cryptocurrency</a> analyst, explained in a recent tweet that Bitcoin may surge significantly higher in the near-term if it holds above $8,700, further adding that a drop below this level could spark a significant sell-off that sends BTC reeling to $8,100.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC: Much like $9,100 was a good short R:R-wise, I think $8,700 is a good long R:R-wise. Watching this closely, if we nuke through this support I’d say we’re going to ~$8,100,” he said while pointing to the chart seen below.</blockquote>

      <p>In the coming hours and days, Bitcoin’s response to its immediate support level will likely elucidate how it will trend in the near-term, as it may be able to once again climb back above $9,000 if bulls garner enough strength to hold <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/14/bitcoin-could-soon-incur-major-volatility-as-bears-gain-upper-hand/">BTC</a> above $8,700.</p>
