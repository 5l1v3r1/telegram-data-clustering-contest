      <p>With tomorrow's launch of Disney+ just hours away, the newest entrant into the streaming wars has added just a little more incentive. Nearly a month ago a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/14/disney-plus-twitter-promotion/">mammoth video and tweetstorm previewed "basically everything" coming to Disney+ at launch</a>, but since then Disney dropped in surprise news that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/avengers-endgame-disney-plus-marvel-release-date/"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i> will be available day one (earlier than expected)</a>, and now it has filled out the MCU lineup <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/marvel-cinematic-movies-mcu-disney-plus">with a total of 16 out of 23 movies</a>.</p>
