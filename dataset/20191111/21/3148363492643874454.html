      <p>A group donning “Make America Great Again” hats participated in a flag-waving ceremony in honor of veterans “on the 12th Avenue overpass across I-84” on Sunday –  a ceremony which attracted opposition.</p>

      <p>According to officers, a woman <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/proud-boys-flag-waving-fight/283-e997f0f5-a316-4918-a440-399f7fd706fa">confronted</a> the group flag-wavers, and tensions quickly escalated between the protester and a woman participating in the ceremony. LaRosa was there <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/w/1OdJrLyYryQKX">live-streaming</a> the event. Her stream shows two women in a scuffle, with one hitting the other.</p>
      <p>LaRosa went over and can be heard urging them to stop. At that point, LaRosa’s stream went dark, as she directly intervened to split up the fight.</p>
      <p>Another video of the incident shows LaRosa on top of the woman, repeatedly telling her to “relax.” The woman, who claimed to be a professor, allegedly bit LaRosa in the chest.</p>
      <p>One individual from the group can be heard telling the protester, “You assaulted someone.”</p>

      <p>“Get off me. I’m like half-naked,” the woman bizarrely claimed.</p>
      <p>“I was just got done having brunch with my friends,” she continued, accusing them of “antagonizing the city I live in.</p>
      <p>“Stop f*ck*ng trying to fight. We’re not here to fight,” LaRosa says in the video. “We’re just here waving flags celebrating Veterans Day.</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe this. This has been my whole life. I’ve always had to be the person … to show, to fight,” the woman continued.</p>
      <p>“You don’t know what Donald Trump is,” she added.</p>
      <p>Another video shows the protester at the center of the scuffle attacking one of the flag-wavers first.</p>

      <p>“I pulled her off using jiujitsu techniques … I keep people safe; that’s what I do,” LaRosa <a href="https://www.theblaze.com/news/female-mma-fighter-takes-down-anti-trump-professor-who-allegedly-started-fight-at-flag-wave-honoring-veterans-in-portland">said</a>, explaining her decision to intervene.</p>
      <p>“Toward the end of our day, a woman came up &amp; started berating us,” LaRosa wrote on Twitter following the incident. “She didn’t get a reaction from me so she moved on &amp; attacked another women in our group. I had to break up a fight &amp; put her down till the cops came. I had just started live streaming.”</p>
