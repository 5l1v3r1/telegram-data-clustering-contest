      <h1>DC Universe's flagship show 'Titans' renewed for third season</h1>
      <h2>WarnerMedia still has confidence in Robin and crew.</h2>

      <p>DC Universe's fate is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/21/doom-patrol-season-2-and-hbo-max/">less than certain</a>, but it's clear that at least one marquee series is safe. DC and WarnerMedia have <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/titans-dc-universe-flagship-series-will-return-for-season-3-on-streaming-site-1202782967/">renewed</a> <i>Titans</i> for a third season -- the first DC Universe original to get the nod a second time. While there aren't details of what that next season will entail, it's expected sometime in fall 2020.</p>
      <p>Whether or not it remains a DC Universe exclusive in the US is equally unclear. <i>Doom Patrol</i> received a second season, but it'll also be available on HBO Max -- a sign that WarnerMedia might not be comfortable with the show as a DCU-only title. If <i>Titans</i> goes the same route, that will cast further doubts on DCU's future. If nothing else, this could reassure comic book fans worried that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/06/swamp-thing-cancelled-after-a-single-episode/"><i>Swamp Thing</i>'s cancellation</a> hinted at a grim fate for other streaming DC shows.</p>
