        <i>Climate Visuals is a project that aims to create a new visual language for climate change. Images of polar bears, melting ice and factories do not convey the urgent human stories at the heart of the issue. Based on international social research, <a href="http://climatevisuals.org/">Climate Visuals</a> provides insights for a more compelling visual language for climate change. It has recognised existing and outstanding images with impact for its inaugural photography awards. The project is run by <a href="https://climateoutreach.org/climate-communication-awards/#Award3">Climate Outreach</a>, Europe’s leading climate communication organisation, which celebrated its 15th anniversary on 7 November</i>

      <h3>Shortlisted: Looking Through The Doorway by Greta Rybus</h3>
      <p>A man looks through a doorway, which just hours before lead to another room in his home. The sea, which has been rising and eroding the shore, chewed into the home’s foundation and it crumbled into the sea. The United Nations named Saint Louis as the area most at-risk from climate change in Africa. Guet Ndar, where this family called home, is highly populated fishing community. The fishermen have noticed huge changes. They say the ocean used to be a long distance across the beach during low tides; now it laps at their homes. And, they’ve seen an increase in strange winds and storms, making their work at sea more dangerous and volatile. Many people have lost their homes. Date taken: 19/03/2015</p>

      <h3>Shortlisted: Water World Child by Jashim Salem</h3>
      <p>In the past few years, tidal surge – water levels rising significantly above the tide levels that astronomy predicts – has begun to affect the Bangladeshi port city of Chittagong as much as twice a day, resulting in frequent flooding of residential and business areas. If things continue to worsen, most areas of Chittagong could become completely submerged in the near future. Here we see Saraf, eight, sitting on a submerged car at their home flooded by the tidal surge. Date taken: 29/08/2015</p>
