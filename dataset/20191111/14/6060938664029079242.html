      <p>Farhan and Shibani are reportedly serious about their relationship and plan to get married in the first half of 2020, probably in February or March. Shibani is reportedly bonding well with Farhan’s kids and marriage seems to be the next step in their relationship now. Farhan and Shibani sparked rumours of their relationship in October last year, but the couple remained tight lipped about their romance. However now that the cat is out of the bag, Farhan and Shibani don’t shy away from posting loved-up clicks of each other on <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>Farhan and Shibani’s nuptials will be Bollywood’s first wedding of 2020 and could well be followed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Varun-Dhawan">Varun Dhawan</a> and Natasha Dalal’s destination wedding in April.</p>
