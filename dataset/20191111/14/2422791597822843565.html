      <p>TORONTO – Marlee Liss, who opted for a restorative justice process with her rapist, rather than a criminal trial, has started an organization aimed at educating other sexual assault victims about their rights and the potential benefits of doing the same.</p>

      <p>“The trial was a really awful experience,” Liss said on CTV’s Your Morning Monday. “I just found that the punitive process was the least consensual process… such a disempowering experience, to sit on the stand to be drilled with questions that are so invasive and personal to me, and to be met with disbelief.”</p>
      <p>In contrast, Liss found the process of restorative justice was “immensely healing,” and an “opportunity for reclamation” of her voice – something the court process lacked.</p>
      <p>Now she has started her own organization, called <a href="https://www.rehumanizemovement.com/">Re-Humanize</a>, to educate people on the benefits of the restorative justice process, and that the criminal justice system is not their only option when facing their abuser.</p>
      <p>The Re-Humanize organization bases their work on the eight core values of; love, empathy, repair, social context, forgiveness, authenticity, courage and pleasure, <a href="https://www.rehumanizemovement.com/about">according to their website</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think the fact that we’ve equated justice with punishment is a huge disservice to us and I would really like to make [justice] synonymous with healing,” Liss said.</p>
      <p>Liss said her rapist “experienced extensive therapy, consent education, [and] unlearning the patriarchy” as part of the process, and she feels “very reassured” he won’t re-offend and will change his life.</p>
      <p>Although Liss acknowledges that the restorative justice process “is not the right option for everyone,” she says victims of rape and other abuse “have a right to know that it exists” and that it should be “way more accessible.”</p>
      <p>“I think this actually enhances public safety, I think there are so many statistics that show that incarceration leads to recidivism, more violence and re-offence,” she said. “I think that restorative justice places incarceration rightfully as a last resort.”</p>
