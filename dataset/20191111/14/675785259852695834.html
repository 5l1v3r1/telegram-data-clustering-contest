      <p>Tamara Ecclestone is clearly already in the festive spirit - six weeks before Christmas Day is even here.</p>
      <p>The Formula 1 heiress, 35, put up her Christmas decorations last night alongside her husband Jay Rutland, 38, and their daughter Sophia, five.</p>
      <p>Their London mansion was transformed into a winter wonderland as they decorated a giant Christmas tree with white, gold and silver ornaments.</p>
      <p>Dressed in festive red pyjamas, little Sophia had to stand on a step ladder to reach the tree so she could hang up the decorations.</p>
      <p>She twinned with her proud mum, who showed off her natural beauty with no makeup on in the snaps.</p>

      <p>Both Tamara and James, who have been married for six years, posted pictures of their decorating session on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Tamara shared one of Sophia putting the first decoration on the tree, writing: "Feeling festive."</p>
      <p>She then posted a cute photo of her family sitting at the foot of the tree once it was all done.</p>
      <p>"The most wonderful time of the year," she said.</p>

      <p>Jay shared one of Sophia, who they call Fifi, hanging up baubles, and another of the trio posing by their tree together.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "Well it's thatâ€™s time of the year again."</p>
      <p>The couple's followers were baffled that they'd put the decorations up so early.</p>

      <p>One commented: "I think you're a brilliant family but it's too soon!!!"</p>
      <p>"Let's hope that is last years tree as it's too early," another posted.</p>
      <p>A third agreed: "Ridiculous...not even half way through November."</p>
