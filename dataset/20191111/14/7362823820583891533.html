      <p>Hardy resident Kenneth Meador told WFXR he heard the sirens responding to neighbor Rodney Brown’s house but didn’t think anything of it.</p>
      <p>“Then when I heard there’d been a shooting, I didn’t even think about Rodney, because I’ve known Rodney. He grew up here, I did too. We were friends, neighbors,” said Meador. “Rodney was a super nice guy. He was really polite, worked hard. Just a great guy."</p>
