      <p>At Future Publishing Limited we rely on advertising to keep bringing you the content you love to read. The majority of the content on PC Gamer is created solely by our editorial team, but on occasion we also work with external partners to create content we hope our readers will find interesting and useful. </p>
      <p>In some cases the partner provides content for us, but in others they support us in producing content but we maintain editorial independence. This additional content is labelled so you can see who has funded it and how it was created, and we have created this page to make it clear to you exactly what those labels mean about how the content you're reading was funded. </p>

        <b>Supported Editorial</b>
      </p>
      <p>Articles that are labelled as being written 'in association' with are independent editorial articles, created by writers employed by PC Gamer that have been funded through the support of a commercial partner. When planning supported content, a senior editor will agree the topic and the headline of the article with the funding partner but is not obliged to take further direction from the partner. The article is written by a PC Gamer journalist, or one under the direction of a PC Gamer senior editor, and posted to PC Gamer. It is not sent to the funding partner for approval. This content abides by the Editors’ Code of Practice from the Independent Press Standards Organisation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Advertisement Feature</b>
      </p>
      <p>Articles that are labelled 'Advertisement Feature' are paid for and controlled by a commercial partner. They may be produced by the client or by staff employed by PC Gamer. This is commercial content and so is subject to the Advertising Standards Authority and Federal Trade Commission regulations.</p>
