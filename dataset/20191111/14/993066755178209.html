      <p>Jeremy Vine will find out who would triumph between a University Challenge winner or a contestant on The Chase with a new quiz show.</p>
      <p>Quizmaster will pit winning intellects against each other to see who dominates the favourite TV format.</p>
      <p>Former contestants from Who Want To Be A Millionaire?, Mastermind, Fifteen To One, The Chase, and University Challenge will go head to head.</p>
      <p>ITV has commissioned the show, which seeks to find who is the cleverest of them all.</p>
      <p>Vine said: “How clever do you have to be to win a million on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Cleverer than a Mastermind Champion?</p>
      <p>“Or are the students on University Challenge the brainiest? Well, we decided to find out. And you could have cut the tension in the studio with a knife.”</p>
      <p>The 15 quiz champions tackle a series of rounds, with eliminations whittling the group down to just two, who face each other in the final.</p>
      <p>Daniela Neumann, of show producers Spun Gold, added: “We Brits love a quiz show – from the intellectual rigours of Mastermind to the high drama and life-changing moments of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, we are a nation of quiz addicts.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve never seen the contestants of these shows competing against each other. Quizmaster will answer the ultimate question all fans want to know – who is the cleverest of them all?”</p>
      <p>The air date for Quizmaster is yet to be announced.</p>
