      <p>Prioritising style and comfort, which of these two is a better SUV, the Jaguar F-pace and the BMW X4 20d?</p>
      <p>I am confused in between the Jaguar F-pace and the BMW X4 20d. My priorities are style and comfort.</p>

      <p><b>AAA -</b> Style is a subjective thing and both the F-Pace and X4 look good, though the coup√©-like design of the X4 makes it the more striking looking of the two. Also, the X4 is more modern and up to date, and more fun to drive. However, because of the sloping roof, the X4 has limited headroom at the rear, which you need to keep in mind if you have passengers regularly.</p>
