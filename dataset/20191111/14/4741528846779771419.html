      <p>Thousands of eager shoppers stormed the website of foremost e-Commerce giant, Konga to be among the first to grab the mega deals on offer as Konga Yakata went live by stroke of midnight on Monday, November 11<sup>th</sup> 2019. Konga Yakata, the much-anticipated Black Africa sales of Nigeria’s retail giant Konga, runs throughout the month of November and ends on Thursday, December 12<sup>th</sup> 2019.</p>
      <p>Equally important, the commencement of the massive discount sales coincides with the globally celebrated Singles Day sales popularized by China’s retail giant, Alibaba.</p>
      <p>Konga Yakata is widely regarded as the biggest sales event in Nigeria’s shopping calendar. The month-long promotion is marked by huge price slashes, rock-bottom prices and loads of deals on a wide variety of products across multiple categories.</p>
      <p>Bargain-hungry Nigerians had received a taste of what to expect at this year’s edition of Konga Yakata on Friday when a huge crowd converged on the Konga retail store at Saka Tinubu, Victoria Island to take advantage of the discount sales which marked the formal opening of the store. As a result, anticipation was sky-high for the commencement of the 2019 edition of Konga Yakata.</p>
      <p>Insights reveal that the Konga website started recording huge hits from around 11pm on Sunday night. Many Nigerians had denied themselves sleep to lay in wait on the website for the official commencement of Konga Yakata by 12am.</p>
      <p>Head of Marketing, Chidalu Ekeh, disclosed that traffic to the website @ <a href="http://www.konga.com/">www.konga.com</a> spiked astronomically from 12am.</p>
      <p>“We were recording huge hits by the minute. Apparently, a lot of our customers had stayed awake for the formal commencement of Konga Yakata by 12am. We experienced a massive upturn in traffic from around 12am as orders started dropping. However, we were able to manage the spike and attend to all the orders and enquiries that flooded in, due to the painstaking work we had put in behind the scenes in preparation for Konga Yakata.</p>
      <p>“Also, we expect the traffic to maintain its pace and grow even higher throughout the day as more people join the fun. Konga Yakata is a month-long shopping extravaganza. In fact, it is the biggest sales event of the year and we are anticipating even more turnout than the 2018 edition.</p>
      <p>“Already, we have received notices from our customers who will be storming our retail stores nationwide. Queues are expected at most of these stores today as well. But we are ready to meet and exceed every expectation,” she disclosed.</p>
