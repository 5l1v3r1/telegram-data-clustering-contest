        <i><b>Lilian Baylis Studio, London</b><br/>It’s hard not to warm to this bright Welsh company, but some of the more experimental works were confused in design and execution</i>
      </p>
      <p>It takes a lot of grit and pluck to run a small ballet company. With a fraction of the resources of a major institution, you’re never going to stage Swan Lake, or attract the top-flight talents of a Royal Ballet; you have to have a different vision.</p>
      <p>Newport’s <a href="http://welshballet.co.uk/">Ballet Cymru</a> seems to run on sheer positivity, the beaming smiles of the 12 young dancers almost disconcerting during their opening salvo, artistic director <a href="http://welshballet.co.uk/people/darius-james/">Darius James</a>’s Celtic Concerto, but they quickly get you on their side. It’s a brisk, bright and light dance to the sound of harpist Catrin Finch – a proudly Welsh endeavour. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/danilamarzilli/?hl=en">Danila Marzilli</a> is the standout dancer, with fluent, full-bodied command of the choreography.</p>
      <p>But this triple bill shows another side of the sweet and spritely Welsh Ballet. Following a not-too-subtle sketch on division and repair by <a href="http://welshballet.co.uk/people/patricia-vallis/">Patricia Vallis</a> comes a commission from up-and-comer <a href="http://charlotteedmonds.com/">Charlotte Edmonds</a>, 22. Plucked from training to a choreographic apprenticeship with the Royal Ballet, she’s now working as a freelance dance-maker across Europe.</p>
      <p>Her piece for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ballet">Ballet</a> Cymru, Wired to the Moon, comes with a blurb about functioning systems and interconnected technology. What it actually shows us is a choreographer still finding her voice on a stage dressed with various experimental tropes: set blocks that the dancers move themselves, sand pouring from the ceiling, a clock counting down, a street noise soundscape and piles of televisions (cathode ray, which doesn’t shout future tech, more degree show art installation). The dancers in black suits and bored-model stares perform casual cool, frantic gesticulation and jagged-edge moves, mixing music video vibes with ballerina pointe shoes.</p>
      <p>There’s a confusion of ideas here and a company not experienced enough to sell it. But there are signs that Edmonds is the real deal – amid a frenetic early solo, there’s a sudden slowdown and focus pull on the smallest of movements, a little ronde de jambe en l’air, toe kissing the knee, and it’s a gem of a moment.</p>
      <p>Even if this piece doesn’t come off, it’s a laudable, still enjoyable effort, and you can’t help but warm to this plucky troupe.</p>
      <p>• <a href="http://welshballet.co.uk/whats-on/tour-dates/">Ballet Cymru tours the UK</a> until 7 December.</p>
