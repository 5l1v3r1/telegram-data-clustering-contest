      <h2>The Supreme Court had on November 4 banned construction and demolition activities in the region till further orders</h2>

      <p>A CPCB-led task force on Monday recommended extending the restrictions on dirty fuel-based industries in Delhi and its suburbs till November 13.</p>
      <p>The task force also recommended the ban on hot-mix plants and stone-crushers in Delhi-NCR till Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The operation of industries may commence from November 14," it said.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court had on November 4 banned construction and demolition activities in the region till further orders.</p>
      <p>At a review meeting on Monday, India Meteorological Department officials told the 10-member task force that northwesterly winds and an increase in the incidents of stubble burning have led to a deterioration in air quality.</p>
      <p>Delhi-NCR's air quality is expected to oscillate between "very poor" and "severe" categories till Wednesday. After November 13, stronger winds are likely to reduce pollution levels, an IMD official said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, on the recommendations of the task force, the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority had ordered closure till Monday morning of all coal and other fuel-based industries, which have not shifted to natural gas or agro-residue, Faridabad, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwadi, Greater Noida, Sonepat and Panipat.</p>
