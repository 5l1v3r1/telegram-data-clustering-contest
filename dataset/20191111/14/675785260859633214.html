      <h2>Ant McPartlin's estranged wife Lisa Armstrong broke her silence to condemn the reports about their divorce talks as"lies"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:09:06+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Furious Lisa Armstrong has branded reports about her wanting more than half of Ant McPartlin's fortune as "lies" as her estranged husband prepares to host I'm A Celebrity for the first time since 2017.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> makeup artist, who split from Ant in late 2017, took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to defend herself against accusations she wants more than half of Ant's estimated £62million fortune.</p>
      <p>Weekend reports suggested Lisa has rejected Ant's settlement deal and is taking him back to court to "have her day".</p>
      <p>"What the general public and his fans don't realise is that Ant's decision to end the marriage came after years of Lisa trying to save him from himself," a source told the Mail on Sunday.</p>

      <p>"There were at least three years when she was at her wits' end and it was tough. Watching him move on was very, very difficult.</p>
      <p>"Lisa is very much aware that a judge may not award her as much as Ant is offering but she doesn't care," added the insider.</p>
      <p>But when one follower told Lisa she was being greedy on Twitter, Lisa set her straight.</p>
      <p>"How can 31million, not be enough for you?! It’s enough for both me and my family put together for life. Just sayin'," commented the follower.</p>
      <p>Lisa sniped back: "Don't believe the lies <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/justsaying?src=hashtag_click">#justsaying</a> ."</p>

      <p>One fan then told Lisa: "Let’s go to court arm in arm (see there faces )."</p>
      <p>She wrote back, "Come on then...," adding three kissing emojis.</p>
      <p>It was an unusually frank exchange for Lisa, who has mostly kept quiet about her divorce from Ant since finding out he was dating her former personal assistant Anne-Marie Corbett.</p>
      <p>Ant went public with his new romance last June, prompting Lisa to lash out at her ex on social media for not giving her the heads up he was with her ex-friend.</p>

      <p>Since then, the warring exes have been butting heads over custody of their Labrador Hurley and who should get their beautiful marital home in London's upmarket Chiswick.</p>
      <p>Last week it was claimed Ant was "desperate" to reach a divorce settlement before the launch of I'm A Celebrity on Sunday.</p>
      <p>He reportedly made a move to set up new mediation talks so they can sort it out away from court.</p>
      <p>But Lisa is refusing to be pressured into a pay-off that she she doesn't think is right and won't sign a non-disclosure agreement, claiming she wants her day in court.</p>
