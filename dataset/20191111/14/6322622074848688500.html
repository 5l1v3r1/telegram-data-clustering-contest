      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 11): United Plantations Bhd’s net profit fell 36.53% to RM60.2 million or 28.97 sen per share in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19), from RM94.85 million or 45.65 sen per share in the same period last year, as revenue declined.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue fell 18.25% to RM278.66 million from RM340.86 million last year, according to a filing to Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>The group declared dividends of 30 sen per share, comprising a 20 sen interim dividend and a 10 sen special dividend, for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019 (FY19). They will be payable on Dec 6.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine months of FY19, the group's net profit fell 28.14% to RM203.07 million or 97.73 sen per share,from RM282.6 million or 136 sen per share last year, while revenue went down 10.74% to RM871.46 million from RM976.33 million.</p>
      <p>Earnings were lower due to the decrease in revenue for the plantation and refinery segments.</p>
      <p>Under the plantation segment, the lower profit for the period was due to lower average selling prices of crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK) achieved, which declined by 10.3% and 38.7% respectively.</p>
      <p>Refinery segment’s decrease in profit before tax, on the other hand, was due to lower margins for lauric products.</p>
      <p>On prospects, with the low average selling prices seen in the first half of 2019 – of below RM2,000 per MT – United Plantations is expecting the results for its FY19 to be lower than 2018.</p>
      <p>This was despite the recovery in CPO market price – which rebounded to around RM2,200 per MT – due to lower than expected Malaysian production during July to September of this year, coupled with the higher demand from especially China and India.</p>
      <p>“Nevertheless, with the prices contracted under our forward sales policy combined with our Malaysian production improving due to further areas steadily coming into maturity from our replanted fields, the Board of Directors expects that the results will still be satisfactory,” said United Plantations.</p>
      <p>While most expert speakers expressed a bullish market view for 2020, United Plantations said it is cautiously optimistic as the company is concerned about the impact of the ongoing trade war between the US and China as well as the subdued global economy which continues to indicate uncertainties and weaknesses.</p>
      <p>Shares of United Plantations closed 38 sen or 1.49% lower at RM25.20 today, valuing the company at RM5.21 billion.</p>
