      <p>WhatsApp is continuing work on this new dark theme. Unlike with Instagram and Facebook Messenger, it seems this app will have a selection of themes. Light, Dark Grey and Night Blue. WABetainfo has uncovered further evidence in favour of this with the addition of a new Night Blue wallpaper in the new WhatsApp beta release.</p>

      <p>Following logically from the addition of this new asset into the beta files, it is also likely that WhatsApp is nearing a final release for dark mode – hopefully in time for Christmas. It is a feature that users have been loudly demanding on social media ever since iOS 13 and Android 10 dropped after all.</p>
      <p>While a dark theme may not necessarily be the best for your eyes, and<a href="https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/11/10/just-putting-it-out-there-fuck-dark-mode-sucks-worst-awful/"> some even disagree heartily</a> with the concept, there’s no denying that it does look cool. In the end, options are almost always better, and WhatsApp is opting for more, rather than less.</p>
