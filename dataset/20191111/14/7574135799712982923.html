      <p>A Canadian native who has lived in California for many years, <b>Neil Young</b> recently applied for U.S. Citizenship as he wants to vote in the 2020 election. But Young says application is being held up due to his marijuana use. From a post on Neil Young Archives titled “<a href="https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=I-Have-Been-Very-Successful-In-My-Life">I Have Been Very Successful in My Life</a>,” he writes:</p>
      <blockquote>When I recently applied for American citizenship I passed the test. It was a conversation where I was asked many questions. I answer them truthfully and past. Recently however I have been told that I must do another test due to my use of marijuana and how some people who smoke it have exhibited a problem.<br/><br/>The problem is defined in an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/policymanual/updates/20190419-ControlledSubstanceViolations.pdf">April 19, 2019 addition</a> under Attorney General Sessions. USCIS issued a policy alert which includes:<br/><br/>‘An applicant who is involved in certain marijuana related activities may lack GMC (good moral character) if found to have violated federal law even if such activity is not unlawful under applicable state or foreign laws.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope I have exhibited good moral character and will be able to vote my conscience on Donald J. Trump and his fellow American candidates (as yet un-named).</blockquote>
