        <b>Move over, modern consoles! Those who wish to get their <i>groove</i> on have decided to get Just Dance 2020 on the Nintendo Wii.</b>
      </p>
      <p>13 years after the release of Nintendo’s revolutionary motion-controlled system, gamer-dancers are still playing with the <i>ancient </i>console. With two successors already released – the Wii U and the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/the-witcher-3-switch-review-is-a-fantastically-impossible-port/">Nintendo Switch</a> – it’s impressive but not entirely surprising to see the casual title responding so well on the Wii.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://ukie.org.uk/">UK Gaming Charts</a> discovered that the Ubisoft dancing game was increasingly popular on the old Wii, selling considerably more during launch week than Xbox One and PS4.</p>
      <p>During the launch period, the title sold 21% of all copies on the Nintendo Wii. In comparison, Xbox One sold 10% whereas PS4 sold 14%. Out of every console available, Just Dance 2020 sold the most on the Switch. Nintendo Switch copies made up for 55% of all copies sold.</p>
      <p>Ubisoft has previously commented on their reasoning behind releasing the dancing game on the Wii. While this will be the last title for Nintendo’s system, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/just-dance-2020-will-be-the-last-game-for-the-nintendo-wii/">Ubisoft stated that the demand was still there</a>. With the Wii being one of the highest selling consoles in the world — with all content also playable on the Wii U — it’s no surprise that people are still buying new content.</p>
