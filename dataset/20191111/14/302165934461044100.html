      <p>LYON, Nov 11 — An unusually strong earthquake hit southeastern France today, injuring four people, one of them seriously, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The quake, with a magnitude of 5.4, was felt in a vast area between the cities of Lyon and Montelimar which are about 150 kilometres apart, the national seismological office said.</p>
      <p>“I was leaning against the oven in my mother’s bakery when I felt the tremor,” said Victoria Brielle, a resident in Privas, some 25 kilometres from the quake’s epicentre.</p>
      <p>“A customer’s crockery toppled over and everything broke,” she said.</p>
      <p>Another resident in the area, Didier Levy, who lives in a 15<sup>th</sup> century castle, told AFP that “chandeliers were still trembling” several minutes after the quake.</p>
      <p>Levy, who said his dog starting barked even before humans felt the tremors, added: “I have never experienced anything like it, I could feel the trembling even though these wall are one metre thick.”</p>
      <p>One person was seriously hurt when a scaffolding collapsed, the regional prefect’s office said.</p>
      <p>Three other people in the neighbouring Ardeche region were slightly injured. — AFP</p>
