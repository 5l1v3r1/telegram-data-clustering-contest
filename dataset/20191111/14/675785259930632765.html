      <h2>Nigel Farage's Brexit Party today bowed to pressure and pulled its candidates from every single Conservative constituency - giving Boris Johnson's Tories a free run for the general election</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:51:18+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Kevin Maguire, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/kevinmaguire/</a></address>
      <p>Establishment lickspittle “Sir” Nigel Farage’s coveted knighthood will surely finally arrive from a grateful <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> .</p>
      <p>The Thatcherite city slicker, a Tory member for a decade before switching to equally Right-wing Ukip then creating a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> Party which is really Il Duce’s personal company, yearns for a Ruritanian title.</p>
      <p>Disappointed it wasn’t conferred after the 2016 referendum, unlike the rejected peerage he claims was offered by the Tories as recently as a few days ago, the grinning bauble “Sir” Nigel wouldn’t be required to register ill-gotten financial gains. </p>
      <p>Pulling candidates out of 317 Tory seats and standing against only <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> and other opposition parties may not have a significant impact on the election result though it dashes <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> ’s hopes of picking up a few Conserative marginals.</p>
      <p>The best guesstimate is Farage’s gang attracts two Tory voters for every one gained from Labour.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>By not splitting the Brexit fanatics in Tory seats the survival chances are improved for defending Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Labour’s unspoken dirty secret is it requires Brexit Party wannabes in vulnerable seats to dampen Johnson’s blues where Corbyn’s lot are fighting off a strong Tory challenge.</p>
      <p>Private schoolboy Farage consistently misrepresented first Ukip’s and now the Brexit Party’s appeal to Labour voters to burnish his vainglorious credential as a posh-of-the-people.</p>
      <p>Multi-millionaire Home Counties property developer Richard Tice bought a flat cap for austerity-ravaged Hartlepool because the Monkey Hangers gave Ukip its best 2017 result in a Labour seat. It polled just 11.5%.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The lasting impact of bottler Farage’s surrender act, waving the white flag at Johnson without a political concession, perhaps that future knighthood his only compensation for a humiliating withdrawal agreement, is confirming his, his party and Brexit’s true colours.</p>
      <p>Brexit is a Right-wing plot by Thatcherites such as Farage to turn Britain into a deregulated Treasure Island for the world’s filthy rich as the expense of workers’ rights and public services.</p>
      <p>The charlatan who advocated privatising the NHS is wrestling Johnson to discover which climbs furthest and fastest up <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> ’s colon.</p>
      <p>Labour’s fighting Johnson’s Tory Brexit Party and Farage’s Brexit Tory Party.</p>
      <p>Chump “Sir” Nigel’s simplified those battlelines. </p>
      <p>Voters see Boris Farage and Nigel Johnson are two cheeks on the same Tory backside.</p>
