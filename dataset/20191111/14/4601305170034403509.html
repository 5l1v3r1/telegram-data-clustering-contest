      <h1>This $3.5 million mansion includes a replica of Bruce Wayne's study and so much more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T14:30:24+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 14:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/thomdunn" target="_blank">Thom Dunn</a></address>
      <p>Former Pittsburgh radio personality T.J. Lubinsky is selling his <a href="https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=xVddJawJrav&amp;amp%3Bmls=1&amp;fbclid=IwAR2F9l25E8uLWRcTlgyDGrmPZ_ygydv423pPE-1dU12CDjqU5z1TjJC0CWU">home</a>, about a half-hour outside the city in Gibsonia, Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>I'll be honest, I've never heard of this guy. But apparently he has <a href="https://www.conservapedia.com/TJ_Lubinsky">quite a resume</a>. Which I guess is how he and his wife Wenday were able to build this <a href="https://www.redfin.com/PA/Gibsonia/724-Bristlecone-Dr-15044/home/74441400">absurdly palatial estate</a> with 14 bedrooms, 10 bathrooms, a "<a href="https://www.trulia.com/p/pa/gibsonia/724-bristlecone-dr-gibsonia-pa-15044--2013775572?mid=6#lil-mediaTab">waterfall poolside oasis</a>" with a custom Lilliput playhouse for the kids, and—oh yeah, a two-story replica of the <a href="https://www.trulia.com/p/pa/gibsonia/724-bristlecone-dr-gibsonia-pa-15044--2013775572?mid=24#lil-mediaTab">Heinz Chapel</a> as well as a replica of the private study from the <a href="https://www.trulia.com/p/pa/gibsonia/724-bristlecone-dr-gibsonia-pa-15044--2013775572?mid=62#lil-mediaTab">1966 "Batman" show</a>, complete with sliding bookcases, a red phone, and Batpoles.</p>
      <p>It also contains replica rooms based on "the Queen’s residence next to the Ritz London" and "<a href="https://www.trulia.com/p/pa/gibsonia/724-bristlecone-dr-gibsonia-pa-15044--2013775572?mid=25#lil-mediaTab">the Hotel Del Coronado in California</a>." Did I mention that the whole design is based on Newport's <a href="https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/rhode-island/seaview-terrace-ri/">Seaview Terrace/Carey Mansion</a>, which was used as the exterior shots for Collinwood Manor in the classic vampire soap opera "Dark Shadows?"</p>
      <p>While I <i>personally</i> couldn't afford the $3.5 million it would cost to buy this place, but all things considered, I think that's actually a pretty reasonable price for it.</p>
