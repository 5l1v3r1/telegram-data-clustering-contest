      <p>The Congress on Monday decided to hold further talks with ally <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nationalist-congress-party">Nationalist Congress Party </a>(NCP) on whether to support the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>to form a government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>"The Congress President has spoken to Sharad Pawarji. The party will have further discussions with the NCP," a statement issued by party general secretary K C Venugopal said.</p>
      <p>After two crucial meetings, the top leaders of the party preferred to have detailed discussions with the NCP on the current political impasse in the state.</p>
      <p>"The Congress Working Committee met this morning and held a detailed discussion on the situation in Maharashtra after which a consultation was held with Maharashtra Congress leaders," the statement said.</p>
      <p>In a telephonic conversation with Sonia Gandhi, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>Chief <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/uddhav-thackeray">Uddhav Thackeray </a>sought her party's support to form government.</p>
      <p>The Sena is the second largest party in the 288-member House with 56 MLAs after the BJP (105).</p>
      <p>Given the stalemate between the two alliance partners, the role of the Congress with its 44 legislators and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nationalist-congress-party">Nationalist Congress Party </a>with 54 MLAs is crucial.</p>
