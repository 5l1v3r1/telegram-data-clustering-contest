      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday said that the war against government will continue and the opposition parties are in touch with us.</p>
      <p>Addressing the participants of the Azadi March sit-in in Islamabad on Sunday, he said that the opposition parties are holding discussions for the next course of action, adding that we will move forward after discussions between leaders.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F chief said that it is mandatory to raise voice whether a Muslim or non-Muslim forcefully come into power, adding that we have raised voices against a government which forcefully came into power.</p>
      <p>Fazlur Rehman further asked the Prime Minister Imran Khan to keep sitting on the chair but this nation doesn’t recognise you as its ruler.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that the incumbent government was afraid of his Azadi March, adding that the marchers had reduced the government’s mountain of ego.</p>
      <p>Regarding the merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said that the government promised to give FATA Rs100bn every year for 10 years and not a single penny was given, adding that no province is willing to give from its share of the federal NFC award.</p>
      <p>Fazl went on to say that the government failed to pay attention to the country’s economy.</p>
      <p>He said the wheat production has gone down by 30 percent in the past year, while rice production has declined by 30-40pc and of the cotton target of 15 million bales set, a mere 8pc was achieved."</p>
