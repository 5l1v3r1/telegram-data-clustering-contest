      <p>One of the most common additions to a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/games">gaming</a> set-up these days is undoubtedly a nice gaming chair. In this regard, while <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/corsair">Corsair</a> isn’t the best-known name in this market (despite their near dominance in every other aspect of PC components), its latest T3 RUSH <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/category/gaming-chair">gaming chair</a> will undoubtedly be looking to change that.</p>
      <p>Coming in three colour options and packing a lot of functionality, this premium-level design is certainly worth a look!</p>

      <h3>Corsair T3 Rush</h3>
      <p>With the release of the T3 RUSH, Corsair is looking to provide the market with a sleek and professional gaming chair, but of course with the assurance associated with their well-known and highly respected brand.</p>
      <p>Available in three colours, the T3 Rush designs include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Charcoal</li>
        <li>Grey/Charcoal</li>
        <li>Grey/White</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>“The CORSAIR T3 RUSH gaming chair combines racing-inspired design and contoured comfort, with a breathable soft cloth exterior, padded neck cushion and memory foam lumbar support.” – <a href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Gaming-Chairs/T3-RUSH-Gaming-Chair/p/CF-9010029-UK">Corsair</a></blockquote>

      <h3>What Do We Think?</h3>
      <p>As a gaming chair, they certainly look more than a little impressive in terms of functionality and comfort. Admittedly though, they are perhaps a little <i>too</i> understated and professional for their own good. Albeit, at least it isn’t plastered with RGB lighting.</p>
      <p>Although they have not hit retail shelves just yet, a price in the region of £250-£300 is expected and, for mid-premium level models, that is going to be competitive based on what this has to offer. For us, however, it has to be the white/grey design. You need a little bling in your life!</p>
