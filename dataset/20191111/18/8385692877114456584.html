      <p>Best Buy is selling one of LG's best-selling <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">smart TVs</a> for just $299 today. It's a 55-inch TV from the 6090 series, which is an LCD TV. And that explains why it is so cheap â€“ seeing as OLED usually rarely hits below a grand.</p>
      <p>This is a really great price for this TV from LG, and getting a 55-inch TV for this price is pretty insane. You usually don't see prices this low until January, in many Super Bowl sales.</p>
      <p>LG is pretty good at making some really incredible TVs, and this one is no exception. It's an LCD display, but it still provides a really great experience. Thanks to the quad-core processor inside, the picture looks amazing, and the operating system running on this TV, is super fast.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>There is also support for most of the HDR standards that you'd expect. That includes HDR10, HLG and more. So you're going to get some bright and crisp colors out of this one.</p>
      <p>Now, LG is running its own proprietary software on this TV. It's webOS, which is actually a really great operating system. It has most of the big name apps that you'd expect on a smart TV in 2019. That includes Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, YouTube and much more.</p>
      <p>LG also has support for both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. That way, no matter which assistant you would rather use, both are supported. And you're going to be able to use your voice to control your smart lights, from your TV, and that is a pretty crazy thing to be able to do.</p>
