      <h1>Kogi Governorship: Thugs burn SDP secretariat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:14:19+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/362218-kogi-governorship-thugs-burn-sdp-secretariat.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>Barely five days to the governorship election in Kogi State, suspected thugs on Monday set fire to the secretariat of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Lokoja.</p>
      <p>Journalists gathered that the building was razed at about 1 a.m with furniture, documents, electrical equipment and campaign materials burnt.</p>
      <p>The building, which is located a few metres from the state police command headquarters in Lokoja, was reportedly vandalised on Saturday, November 9 by suspected armed thugs.</p>
      <p>It was learnt that the SDP rented the building from Ndatsu Umaru, a former military governor of Kwara and Kano states.</p>
      <p>Akeem Busari, the state commissioner of police, confirmed the fire incident and said the police had launched an investigation into the arson with a view to identifying and bringing the perpetrators to book.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN) reports that attacks had increased in the state in the past few days, causing fear and tension among the residents.</p>
      <p>In his reaction, the state Chairman of the SDP, Mukhtar Atima, accused the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC) of being behind the attack.</p>
      <p>He said the obvious fear of defeat starring APC in the face made it to “release their boys to unleash terror on our party.”<br/>Aside from this, he said that the governorship candidate of the party, Natasha Akpoti, had been receiving threats from some quarters.</p>

      <p>“No amount of harassment and destruction will deter the party and its governorship candidate from contesting and winning the November 16 election,” he said.</p>
      <p>He appealed to party members and supporters to remain peaceful and not to be deterred by provocative and uncivil conducts of members of the ruling party.</p>
      <p>Kingsley Fanwo, Chairman, Media Committee, Bello/Onoja Campaign Organisation, denied allegations that the hoodlums were sponsored by the APC.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Bello and the leadership of the party were currently engaged in rigorous campaigns, saying “there is no time for irrelevant issues now.”</p>
