      <p>A gin shop in York has banned all Christmas music recorded after the 1960s, declaring they want their store to be a “cheese-free zone” for the sake of their staff.</p>

      <p>York Gin will not be playing so-called classics by Mariah Carey, Wham!, Slade or Live Aid, in favour of vintage songs, classical music and Christmas carols.</p>
      <p>“We’ve tested lots of songs to see which sound OK and which sound weird. And there’s a cut-off in the 1960s. Anything after that has been banned,” Emma Godivala, co-director of York Gin told <a href="https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/18025946.york-shop-bans-modern-christmas-songs---sound-weird/">York Press</a>.</p>
      <p>She says her team “are happy with the decision – they say lots of other shop staff are already going stir crazy with the same Christmas hits being played on a loop.”</p>
      <p>Mariah Carey, meanwhile, revealed last year that she won’t <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mariah-carey-wont-play-want-christmas-thanks-giving-2403842">play the festive track herself until after Thanksgiving.</a></p>
      <p>“I have this rule where I try to get through Thanksgiving. I don’t like when people rush it because once I start I don’t stop until after New Year,” she told Jimmy Kimmel.</p>
      <p>Recent reports have suggested that Mariah makes upwards of  £376,000 from ‘All I Want For Christmas’ per year.</p>
