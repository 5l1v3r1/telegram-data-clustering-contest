        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Pakistan’s department of plant protection under the Ministry of National Food Security and Research said the desert locust activity is part of the creature's migration from summer-monsoon breeding grounds towards coastal areas of Balochistan and does not pose any risk to the food supply.</b>

      <p>The capital of the Pakistani province of Sindh, Karachi, was attacked by a swarm of <a href="https://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/09/karachi-bug-invasion-part-2-attack-of-the-locusts/">desert locusts flying in from Balochistan’s</a> coastal areas on Monday.</p>
      <p>Locusts are a collection of certain species of short-horned grasshoppers. According to an expert, heavy rains in Sindh and Balochistan during monsoon forced locusts to move away from the coastal areas.</p>
      <p>An official at the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1516067">Plant Protection Department Muhammad Tariq Khan</a> said the insects, generally found in deserts, are not harmful.</p>
      <p>Khan explained that the desert locust's preferred habitat is in desert areas. Sandy soil with moisture and vegetation are required for their oviposition and breeding.</p>
      <p>He added that the department was monitoring the situation closely and that desert locust control teams were prepared to overcome any risks the species might pose as per technical guidelines.</p>
      <p>The Sindh government has also issued instructions for preventive measures in the city.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, this is the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907281076384499-grasshopper-invasion-las-vegas-social-media-reactions/">second biggest attack</a> on the port city since 1961, and experts believe that the invasion is due to recent climatic changes.</p>

      <p>​This is the third major invasion this year; the first two in September stayed in the planes of Sindh and Balochistan and destroyed the crops there.</p>
      <p>Karachi residents were quick to react with videos of concern and fear over the epidemic.</p>
