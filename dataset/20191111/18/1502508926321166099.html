      <p>Two auditors were arrested on Monday night in connection with the Rs 4,355-crore alleged Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank scam by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police, an official said.</p>
      <p>The arrested duo, Jayesh Sanghani and Ketan Lakdawala, had served as statutory auditors when the scam was committed and suspected to have played a key role in covering up the irregularities involving some top officials of the bank, he said.</p>
      <p>Police had earlier called Sanghani and Lakdawala, the proprietors of Ashok Jayesh &amp; Associates and Lakdawala &amp; co, respectively, for questionning.</p>
      <p>"They failed to give convincing replies regarding their role as the statutory auditors of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pmc-bank">PMC Bank.</a> They were arrested on Monday evening and booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code," he said.</p>
      <p>Probing the scam, the EOW suspects a nexus between some of the accused and HDIL group companies.</p>
      <p>According to investigators, a deep-rooted conspiracy caused loss of public funds.</p>
      <p>The agency had said that six people have lost their lives due to loss of money and the public is protesting over the irregularities.</p>
      <p>The police so far arrested five persons, including promoters of the HDIL and top officials of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/pmc-bank">PMC Bank.</a></p>
