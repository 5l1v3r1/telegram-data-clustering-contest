        <b>A west Belfast man has spoken of his family's lucky escape, after an automatic air freshener exploded on top of a wood-burning stove.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The explosion happened <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-50367146">in the living room of a house in the Lagmore area</a> at about 23:00 GMT on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A number of family members were in the house, including two children.</p>

      <p>"I came home on Saturday evening, came in and lit the fire, it was very very cold," said the father, who didn't want to be named.</p>
      <p>"Myself, my brothers and the wife were in the kitchen. Literally maybe 20, 30 minutes even, we just heard this almighty explosion.</p>
      <p>"The kitchen window went in. I came into the living room and the whole, front window had been blew out."</p>
      <p>The father said that they were sitting behind the door at the time and if somebody was beside the door they could have been blown "out the window with it".</p>

      <p>The two children, along with their mother, were upstairs when the explosion happened. They had left the living room minutes beforehand.</p>
      <p>As they all ran downstairs to see what had happened, the mother fell down the stairs, suffering a pelvic injury.</p>
      <p>"It blew open the door, but this is the amazing thing - there's not a pick of damage in the living room," said the father.</p>
      <p>"There's mirrors, there's pictures, there's lamps, TV - not one bit of damage. Just the windows have been blown out. I just can't get my head around it."</p>

      <p>He added: "My gas box is in the living room.</p>
      <p>"How that didn't explode - we just have to thank our lucky stars."</p>
      <p>The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service has urged people to be vigilant and always store any aerosol canisters away from any naked flames or heat.</p>
      <p>"When I lit the fire, I hadn't even realised it was even sitting on top of the fireplace," said the householder.</p>
      <p>"It's been sitting throughout summer, that's the first time the fire has been lit in months.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully, someone will learn something from us."</p>
