      <p>The billionaire creator of Big Brother, John de Mol, has successfully sued Facebook.</p>
      <p>A Dutch court has ordered the social media giant to remove advertisements that feature his likeness to promote fraudulent Bitcoin <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> investments, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/facebook-court-netherlands/dutch-court-orders-facebook-to-pull-financial-fraud-adverts-idUSL8N27R5JT?rpc=401&amp;">Reuters reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Facebook must take down the fraudulent ads or reportedly face fines of up to €1.1 million ($1.2 million).</p>
      <p>The social media giant reportedly argued that it’s simply a “neutral funnel for information” and cannot be obligated to act. Reuters noted the court said this was “not acceptable.”</p>
      <p>“The company plays too active a role with respect to advertisements, which form its primary business model to argue that,” said the court, reportedly.</p>
      <p>The court also highlighted that Facebook sets a pricing policy for ads, as well as policies for deciding on which advertisements are published on its platform.</p>
      <p>In September, Hard Fork <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/09/10/dutch-billionaire-suing-facebook-over-bitcoin-ads-says-agreement-is-impossible/">reported</a> that negotiations between Facebook and de Mol had been ongoing for three months, amounting to basically nothing.</p>
      <p>John de Mol’s legal team estimated that investors had lost €1.7 million ($1.88 million) due to the fraudulent ads.</p>
