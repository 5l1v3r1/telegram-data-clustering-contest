      <p>"You're eating. It's against the law."  That's what this white police officer told a black man who was eating a sandwich while waiting for a train in Contra Costa, California. The man purchased the sandwich in the station, and was eating it outside in the platform while waiting for a BART train. According to the person who shot the video, there are no signs stating that it is forbidden to eat food on train platforms.</p>
      <p>The officer grabbed the man's backpack and asked him for his identification. The man eating the sandwich calmly told the officer that he was doing nothing wrong and refused to show the cop his ID. The cop called for backup and four other officers arrived to handcuff the man and take him away.</p>
      <p>“Four cops for eating a sandwich?,” says the man.</p>
      <p>BART said it is investigating the incident, says <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/bart-investigating-police-confrontation-over-breakfast-sandwich/">The San Francisco Examiner</a>.</p>
