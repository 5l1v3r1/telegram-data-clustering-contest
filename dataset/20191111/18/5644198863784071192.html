      <p>BANGKOK: Sewing machines whir in a Bangkok convent as workers feverishly finish silk robes in brilliant golds and reds, made especially for Pope Francis and his entourage visiting Thailand this month.</p>
      <p>The whirlwind Nov 20 to Nov 23 trip will see the head of the Catholic Church meet top officials, host masses and visit the Catholic faithful in the Buddhist-majority country.</p>

      <p>"I feel happy and very proud that our convent has been selected to do this most honourable job," said Sister Sukanya, who oversees the tailoring.</p>
      <p>She and her team of about a dozen seamstresses have been working long days for two months on the more than 200 robes, many stacked neatly in the convent next to round handmade hats.</p>
      <p>The two most important pieces - two matching robes for the pontiff - are ready to go, displayed proudly side-by-side on a pair of mannequins.</p>
      <p>Embroidered with an intricate "kanok" pattern - a ubiquitous Thai motif seen on clothing, furniture and artwork - the custom-made gold and yellow design will be worn by the pope at his first mass on Nov 21.</p>
      <p>The following day he's set to sport a nearly identical robe in red and gold colours.</p>

      <p>"Our Thai style is a beautiful creation," Sister Saengpradab told AFP, as seamstresses hunched under a Jesus statue nearby, measuring, cutting and sewing reams of silk.</p>
      <p>It has been nearly four decades since a pontiff visited Thailand, and the trip will mark the 350th anniversary of the first official mission to the country.</p>

      <p>The Pope is set to meet Thailand's king and prime minister, hold two masses - and reunite with his second cousin, who runs a Catholic girls' school there.</p>
      <p>Today the country's 388,000-strong Christian community makes up an estimated 1 per cent of the population, the majority residing in the north.</p>

      <p>After Thailand, Francis will travel to Japan until November 26, where he will visit Tokyo, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima.</p>
      <p>Since Francis' election six years ago, he has made two trips to Asia, visiting the Philippines and Sri Lanka in 2014, followed by Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2017.</p>
