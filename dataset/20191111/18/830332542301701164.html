      <p>(CNN) - Hey, Black Crowes fans, mark your calendars. The brothers are back.</p>
      <p>Rich and Chris Robinson are getting back together to mark the 30th anniversary of their debut album "Shake Your Money Maker<i>,"</i> and they are playing the entire album.</p>
      <p>The 46-concert tour is scheduled to begin in Austin, Texas, in June and end in Los Angeles in September.</p>
      <p>The tour will include new musicians and its announcement is being marked with an intimate show in New York on Monday and one in Los Angeles on Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Turmoil in the past</h3>
      <p>The band is known for turmoil and disagreements. They <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/black-crowes-rich-robinson-the-band-has-broken-up-63250/">haven't played together since 2013</a>, a little over a year before they publicly announced they were breaking up. The band split vowing to "never play or speak again," but Rich Robinson says that's all behind them now.</p>
      <p>"We love this music. We're musicians. We're brothers. We love each other. We love this opportunity ... Changing the context with Chris and I and all new people is a much healthier place for us," he <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/black-crowes-2020-reunion-tour-dates-910124/">told Rolling Stone.</a></p>
      <p>The Black Crowes produced eight studio albums, four live albums, and sold over 35 million records in the years they were together. Now a new era can begin.</p>
