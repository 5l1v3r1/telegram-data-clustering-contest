      <h1>Madonna sued by fan for 'starting her concerts late'</h1>

      <p>It’s the Queen of Pop vs. the king of wet blankets.</p>
      <p>A Florida man is suing <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/madonna/">Madonna</a>, saying her 10:30 p.m. concert starting time is too late for his early bird schedule, according to a report.</p>
      <p>In his class action lawsuit, Nate Hollander claims he bought three tickets to see the star’s Dec. 17 show at the Fillmore Miami Beach, which was first scheduled to begin 8:30 p.m., <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/madonna-frequently-hours-late-concerts-fan-says-he-s-suing-n1079301">NBC.com reports</a>.</p>

      <p>But the Material Girl pushed back the time two hours, and he no longer wants to go, according to the outlet, which cited a lawsuit filed Nov. 4 in federal court in Miami-Dade County.</p>
      <p>“Ticketholders [have] to work and go to school the next day, which prevent[s] them from attending a concert that would end at around 1:00 a.m.,” the suit states, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>Hollander, who spent a total of $1,024.95, says it’s a breach of contract,  and that the value of the tickets plunged due to the night-owlish time change, according to the report. He says the new time makes re-selling them “impossible.”</p>

      <p>Hollander also accuses the 61-year-old pop legend of repeatedly <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/07/madonna-injured-postpones-brooklyn-madame-x-show/">arriving to her “Madame X Tour”</a> shows tardy, saying she has a “long history of arriving and starting her concerts late.”</p>

      <p>Hollander is also suing Live Nation, the events firm that’s putting on the concert.</p>
      <p>A rep for Madonna didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>
