      <p>JOHOR BAHRU (Nov 11): The Johor office of the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Corporation (SWCorp Malaysia) seized and closed four illegal dump sites in operations conducted on Nov 8 and Nov 9.</p>
      <p>The sites are located in Taman Johor Jaya, Kampung Plentong and two areas in Ulu Choh, Gelang Patah.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued today, SWCorp Malaysia's director in Johor, Cairul Hisham Jalaluddin, said the operations were conducted as a result of information received from the public and surveillance conducted over a period of two months.</p>
      <p>"We found all the sites were operating illegally," he said, explaining that enforcement action had been taken against some of them previously.</p>
      <p>One of the sites comprised a permanent dump site for construction and domestic waste.</p>
      <p>Statements were also taken from six men acting as site operators or lorry drivers.</p>
      <p>The director said an attempt by one of the six, to offer a bribe to enforcement officers during the bust, had been reported to the Johor office of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) for further action.</p>
      <p>He said, this was the first case in Johor, concerning illegal dump sites, to be referred to the MACC.</p>
      <p>Four assets including two lorries were also seized during the busts.</p>
      <p>Cairul Hisham also recommended that the state government takes stern action against all offenders, irrespective of the ownership of land that is being misused as illegal dumpsites.<i> — Bernama</i></p>
