      <p>That being said, <i>The Sun</i> has reported that the Gunners attacker was involved in an accident that saw him collide with a Mercedes-Benz near a county called Hertfordshire recently.</p>
      <p>It can be said that Auba's Lambo is one of his favourite rides, with the Gabonese having frequently customised his R4.5 million supercar.</p>
