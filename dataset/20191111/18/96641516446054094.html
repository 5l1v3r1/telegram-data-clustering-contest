      <h1>The next iPad Pro may arrive in early 2020 with 3D sensors</h1>
      <h2>Augmented reality may be the big focus.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:03:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>You might have to wait a while for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/ipad-pro-leak-suggests-tablet-photography-just-won-t-die/">the next iPad Pro</a>, although it might provide some clever features in the bargain. <i>Bloomberg</i> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">sources</a> claim Apple is planning to release the new pro tablet "as early as" the first half of 2020, and that it would include both two cameras as well as a Face ID-like 3D sensor system to help people create "reconstructions of rooms, objects and people." The rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/30/apple-iphone-3d-cameras-with-frickin-lasers/">3D sensor on iPhones</a> would come later -- you might have to get the iPad Pro if you want Apple's first crack at the new augmented reality tech.</p>
      <p>The same leak also reiterated an earlier <i>The Information</i> report claiming that Apple plans to launch a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-apple-ar-headset-2022.html">mixed AR and VR headset in 2022</a> (possibly in 2021) followed by AR glasses in 2023. The earlier scoop suggested the headset would have high-res displays and a sophisticated AR experience that would let people walk in front of and behind AR objects.</p>
      <p>This isn't great news if you were waiting for an updated iPad Pro. If accurate, the new slate would arrive roughly a year and a half after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/ipad-pro-2018-review/">the current model</a>. It does suggest the new Pro won't be just a mild refresh, though, so it might be an easier sell if you're itching for a high-end tablet and want a meaningful improvement.</p>
