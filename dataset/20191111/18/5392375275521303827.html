      <p>Singles Day is quite often the peak point of the year in terms of sales for many brands. And the famous tablet/laptop makers CHUWI are no exception to this rule, because in the <a href="https://promotion.chuwi.com/chuwi-globalshopping/">current 11.11 shopping festival on Aliexpress</a> managed to smash some records from last year. For starters it took them just 2:26 minutes to surpass $100.000 GMV (Gross Merchandise Volume) and exceed last year GMV numbers in just  1:20:94. Fairly impressive, but they are absolutely not done yet, because the promos and sales are still ticking and people are going for more.</p>

      <p>And there are even some<a href="https://promotion.chuwi.com/chuwi-globalshopping/"> extra promos</a> to help the sales so let’s take a look. The “Buy one get one free” promo is quite self-explanatory and is promising to give the customer some extra accessories for selected models, usually a free stylus pen or a handbag. There are also extra coupons for new customers and you can enter giveaway with simple comments and win a free Hi9 Air tablet. But probably most interesting promo is the 90% discount for the CHUWI CoreBook model, limited to just 6 pieces on November 12th 8:00 PT, but wouldn’t want such beauty for only $50 ?</p>

      <p>There are also special discount coupons <i><b>ILOVEAE20</b> </i>and <i><b>NOTEBOOK30</b> </i>for $20 and $30 discounts for purchases over $200 and $300 respectively, so should be a good way to slash the prices even more. And the offered selection of products is running pretty deep, because you will have a chance to see for the first time for example new CHUWI UBook Pro for just $299.99 and of course the full selection of CHUWI’s products from both tablet and <a href="http://www.gizchina.com/tag/laptop">laptop</a> categories.<a href="https://promotion.chuwi.com/chuwi-globalshopping/"> So check the offers out</a>, because if there is a perfect time to get some shiny new chinese gadget, it’s certainly in Singles Day sales.</p>
