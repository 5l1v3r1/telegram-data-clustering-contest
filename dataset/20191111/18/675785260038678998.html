      <h1>Chelsea assistant Jody Morris mocks Jose Mourinho over latest comments</h1>
      <h2>Frank Lampard's no.2 reacted sarcastically to Mourinho's suggestion that Chelsea could come unstuck against other big sides after some recent results</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:17:57+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea's</a> assistant manager <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jody-morris">Jody Morris</a> has mocked the club's former boss Jose Mourinho following his latest comments about the Blues.</p>
      <p>The Stamford Bridge club have enjoyed a decent run of form which has propelled them to joint-second in the table.</p>
      <p>Alongside manager Frank Lampard, no.2 Morris has seen the Blues win their last seven league matches, including a well-earned victory against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> still had concerns for his former employers, expressing his fears they struggle against the other top sides in the division.</p>
      <p>Mourinho said on Sky Sports: "In the first weekend I was worried and I'm still worried with the big matches."</p>

      <p>He then cited <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> 's two defeats to Man Utd, their loss at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , and the midweek draw with Ajax where they conceded four, as question marks over whether Chelsea had the required pragmatism to challenge the top teams.</p>
      <p>But Morris clearly disagreed with the Portuguese coach, sharing the video of his comments on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , adding: "Jose is still worried," followed by laughing emoji's.</p>
      <p>Mourinho claimed he was "curious" to see how Chelsea would get on in their next fixture - a difficult trip to defending champions Man City at the Etihad.</p>

      <p>It is not the first time this season that Mourinho has expressed a slightly negative opinion of the work of his former player Lampard - who admitted they had been in contact.</p>
      <p>Lampard told talkSPORT last month: "With Jose we would have texts from time to time. We had some at the start of the season around the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> game where he had a little go.</p>
      <p>"It's all good. I've sat in the punditry chair for a year or so. I understand the need to say things so I'm certainly not going to bang on too much."</p>
      <p>However Mourinho did concede that he can see success for Lampard and his young side.</p>
      <p>He added: "I'm curious to see if they found that great empathy between the good football they play and the pragmatism that the top teams must have to play against top teams.</p>
      <p>"When they find that I think they have a great team for the future. I don't believe in them to finish top two, but I believe very seriously for them to finish top four."</p>
