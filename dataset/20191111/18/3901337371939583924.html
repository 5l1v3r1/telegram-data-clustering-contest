      <p>The FC Barcelona superstar inspired his side to a 4-1 LaLiga victory over Celta with yet another hat-trick, included in which were two well-taken free-kick goals.</p>
      <p>Messi's treble saw him become the first player to reach the milestone of 40 goals in a calendar year (across club and country) for the 11th straight time, having first done so back in 2009.</p>

      <p>In doing so, the Argentina superstar also extended the gap over arch-rival Ronaldo, who has scored 40 or more goals in each of the past nine calendar years.</p>
      <p>The Juventus forward, whose own record stretches back to 2010, currently has 29 goals to his name in 2019, and looks unlikely to reach the milestone a 10th time before the year draws to a close.</p>
