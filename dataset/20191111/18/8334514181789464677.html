      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Snack maker Mondelez (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MDLZ.O">MDLZ.O</a>) will offer more treats in smaller portions and with less sugar, as the company behind Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate responds to consumer demands for healthier products, underlined by a survey released on Monday.</p>

      <p>Under pressure from governments and health advocacy groups in recent years, chocolate companies including Mondelez and Nestle (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NESN.S">NESN.S</a>) have raced to develop products with less sugar, in smaller pack sizes and with prominent portion suggestions.</p>
      <p>But sugar content in many products is still relatively high against the World Health Organization’s (WHO) suggestion that people should only consume 50 grams of total sugars each day.</p>
      <p>The online survey of 6,068 adults in 12 countries by the Harris Poll for Mondelez showed that 80% of consumers were looking for healthy, balanced snacks, although the same percentage was also still keen on indulgence.</p>
      <p>“We know consumers want options which is why we offer a range of products that taste great from wholesome to indulgent,” Chris McGrath, vice president and chief of global impact, sustainability and wellbeing, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>“Consumers appreciate choice and the majority agree there is a time and a place for healthier snacks and a time and a place for indulgent ones,” she said. “There is room for both and we see that as a growth opportunity for us.”</p>
      <p>In July, Mondelez launched a version of its popular Cadbury Dairy Milk with 30% less sugar in Britain, which McGrath said was selling well and was being extended into India.</p>
      <p>The bar still has about 39 grams of sugar per 100g, with six squares accounting for nearly 16% of the WHO daily recommendation.</p>
      <p>Mondelez lifted its 2019 sales forecast last month after reporting a 1.1% rise in third-quarter revenue, driven by higher demand in emerging markets where it has been investing heavily.</p>
      <p>It sells a thin version of its Oreo cookies with a third less sugar and a thinner, crispier version of Ritz crackers, which it markets as a healthier option to potato chips.</p>
      <p>The Mondelez survey showed 6 in 10 people prefer to eat many small meals rather than a few large ones, with the trend toward snacking even stronger among younger consumers.</p>
      <p>“We know consumers are on the go more and more and snacking delivers on the convenience they seek,” McGrath said.</p>
      <p>Mondelez has pledged to put 20% of its products in portion-controlled packs of 200 calories or less by 2025, from more than 15% now, and has also been encouraging customers to snack in a more “mindful” way, savoring each mouthful.</p>
      <p>To that end, it has given advice to nutritionists and health care professionals on promoting “mindful eating”, such as putting a portion in a bowl, not eating while also looking at a screen, and eating with your non-dominant hand.</p>
