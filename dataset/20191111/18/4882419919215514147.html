      <p>Sergio Busquets made a small analysis of the Spanish Super Cup draw that pitted Barca against Atletico Madrid on Jan 9 in Saudi Arabia, at the King Abdullah Yeda stadium.</p>
      <p>Busquets, one of the Barca captains, said: "Playing against Atletico is always difficult because they have great players and a great coach. They're a really competitive team that always give you problems."</p>
      <p>He was sad that Barca play in the second semi-final. "We have a day lest of rest before the final, but that's how the tournament is. We hope to compete to the max to win the tournament."</p>
