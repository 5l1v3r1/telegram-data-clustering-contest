      <h1>Inside home mum claims is not safe to live in - with cracked walls and no door</h1>
      <h2>The door of Amy Wilson's rental home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, collapsed and almost fell on her son</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T18:07:11+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>A mum-of-four claims her house is on the verge of collapse and she no longer feels safe living there.</p>
      <p>Amy Wilson moved into her house in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear in April, but says she has faced multiple issues since.</p>
      <p>The mum said that the lintel above her front door collapsed and almost fell on her 18-year-old son Steven in July - and she hasn't had a front door since.</p>
      <p>"It collapsed and came centimetres away from falling on his head," Amy told the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/inside-gateshead-home-mum-four-17233685">Local Democracy Reporting Service and Chronicle Live</a> .</p>

      <p>"If it had been me I would have been coming out the door with my pram."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Gateshead Housing Company , who she rents the property from, said workers are due to start repairs next week.</p>
      <p>But Amy claimed the  house in Beamish Gardens, Wrekenton, has been plagued by a long list of issues since she moved in to the rental this April.</p>
      <p>Amy said her 15-year-old daughter Sophie suffers from asthma, while four-year-old Alman and six-month-old Nikki both have bad colds.</p>
      <p>The mum also claims there are cracks throughout the property and fears that it may not be safe to live in.</p>

      <p>She said: "It needs proper structural investigation, not just slapping plaster on. I think there's something not right in the building I don't think it is safe."</p>
      <p>Amy continued: "I haven't got a front door and it is currently boarded up but it is letting the draft in, I can't keep my house warm.</p>
      <p>"I've got kids off school sick and I'm having to spend £70 a week on gas. I'm putting on £15 every couple of days.</p>
      <p>"I know there are bugs going round and they need to get home and warm, but you can't keep them warm."</p>
      <p>Amy said that her living situation is also impacting her mental health.</p>

      <p>She added: "I want to get the home nice for Christmas. I have depression and I used to be on medication but I came off it.</p>
      <p>"I can feel myself getting back down to where I was."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Gateshead Housing Company said that a structural engineer would ensure the repairs to the property are carried out safely.</p>
      <p>He said: "We are aware of the repairs and have been working with Ms Wilson.</p>
      <p>"The repair work required the involvement of a structural engineer in order to ensure that the repair is both safe and addresses the issue.</p>
      <p>"We have spoken to Ms Wilson to apologise for the delays and have agreed a start date of next week to commence the works."</p>
