      <p>Vividthree Holdings on Monday reported a net profit of S$208,187 for the second quarter ended Sept 30, compared to a net loss of S$456,659 a year ago.</p>
      <p>This came on the back of revenue more than doubling to S$1.8 million from S$670,800 in the previous Q2, attributed to the completion of post-production works in the post-production segment, which includes visual effects and computer-generated imagery for film producers.</p>
      <p>TheÂ virtual reality, visual effects and computer-generated imagery production studio said it intends to further adapt the <i>Train to Busan</i> intellectual property rights for more show concepts and immersive attractions, such as the recent<i> Train to Busan Horror House</i> immersive experience at Resorts World Genting. Shows related to the movie are expected to receive more attention as the sequel <i>Train to Busan 2: Bando</i> is slated to be released in 2020.</p>
      <p>It also intends to venture into webcomic videos, which it will launch at the Singapore Comic Con in December.</p>
      <p>Vividthree shares closed up 0.2 Singapore cent or 1.35 per ent to S$0.15 before the results were announced.</p>
