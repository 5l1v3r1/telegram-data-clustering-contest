      <h1>Bitcoin Demand Model Reveals a ‘Clear Growth Trend’ (Since 2011)</h1>

        <b>The overall chart of Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-needs-100m-positive-interest-per-week-to-keep-8k-price/">demand</a> has shown a clear growth trend, with demand in dollar terms increasing by 2.2 times each year. </b>

      <h3>BTC Demand May Become Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</h3>
      <p>The big mystery for Bitcoin is whether the <a href="https://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/">reward halving</a> would cause a significant price rally. Skeptics see the possibility as rather distant.</p>

      <p>The BTC network has grown over the years, with multiple viewpoints on real-world usage. More fiat money has flowed in the Bitcoin network, for various purposes including mining earnings, speculative trading, and some usage as a means of payment. The Bitcoin network has kept growing its active addresses and transaction count.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Halving Rally: Will It Be Different This Time?</h3>
      <p>Whether BTC will grow its popularity and invite new fund inflows is still an uncertain guess. But if a halving rally does start shaping up like the predictions on different charts, some kind of a bullish price run may materialize.</p>
      <p>The probable day of the halving, May 15, 2020, arrives with varying Bitcoin price predictions, ranging from $16,000 to as high as $60,000. The actual inflows of funds into BTC are difficult to determine, as they come from multiple sources, including fiat, but mostly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/canadian-stablecoin-cusd-officially-launched/">stablecoins</a>.</p>
      <p>It must be noted that, in the past, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-bitcoin-miners-influence-btc-price-action/">Bitcoin price</a> has always taken off significantly after block reward halving events.</p>

      <p>This time, it is uncertain if demand would enter a spiral into a self-fulfilling prophecy, or for the first time fail to give way to a proportionate rally. Currently, the Bitcoin price has failed to set a new record, but there may be signs of renewed interest and accumulation.</p>

      <p>BTC also stands a good chance for an extraordinary upside, which makes investors disregard the risk of its price going to zero or returning to a much lower valuation. The possibility for a far-reaching scenario, in which the price rallies to a new all-time record, is causing at least some traders and investors to bet on an upcoming rally.</p>
      <p>For now, Bitcoin remains subdued, sinking below the $8,800 mark, down to 00.</p>
