      <p>Publisher and events company Informa has taken a minority stake in entrepreneur network Founders Forum as it posted revenue growth for the first 10 months of the year.</p>
      <p>The FTSE 100 company’s investment will see the two firms launch a joint venture to offer “high-profile connections” in the tech industry and expand London Tech Week.</p>

      <p>It came as Informa revealed a 2.8 per cent rise in revenue for the 10 months to the end of October, pushing shares up just under one per cent.</p>
      <p>The business media group, which operates events and exhibitions across a range of sectors, also said it expected seasonally stronger trading in November and December.</p>
      <p>The two-month window is usually a key period for Informa, accounting for 20 per cent of its annual revenue. November alone contributes more than £350m in revenue, the firm said.</p>
      <p>Informa, which snapped up IHS Markit’s tech business in August, said the investment in Founders Forum will help boost its £300m tech division.</p>
      <p>Founders Forum was created in 2011 by Lastminute.com entrepreneur Brent Hoberman and media veteran Jonathan Goodwin.</p>

      <p>It has since expanded beyond its flagship London event and has welcomed a string of high-profile attendees including Sir Richard Branson, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt and media mogul Arianna Huffington.</p>
      <p>Informa chief executive Stephen Carter said: “After 10 months’ trading in 2019, despite an unpredictable economic/geo-political backdrop, the enlarged Informa Group continues to demonstrate resilience and performance, remaining on track for a sixth consecutive year of growth in underlying revenue, profit, adjusted earnings and cashflow.”</p>
