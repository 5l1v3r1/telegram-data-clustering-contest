      <h1>Only-children are 'more likely to be obese' - and their mums may be to blame</h1>
      <h2>A new study by researchers from the University of Oklahoma has revealed that only-children are considerably more likely to be obese than kids with siblings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:23:04+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Whether it’s being bad at sharing or overly-sensitive, many unfavourable traits are often associated with being an only child.</p>
      <p>Now, a new study suggests that only-children are also more likely to be <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/obesity">obese</a> than kids with siblings.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/university-of-oklahoma">University of Oklahoma</a> believe that this link to obesity may be down to the fact that only-children have less healthy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/parenting">family</a> eating practices than people with siblings.</p>
      <p>Dr Chelsea L. Kracht, who led the study, said: “Nutrition professionals must consider the influence of family and siblings to provide appropriate and tailored nutrition education for families of young children.</p>
      <p>“Efforts to help all children and families establish healthy eating habits and practices must be encouraged.”</p>

      <p>In the study, researchers asked mothers of only-children to keep daily food logs for both themselves and their child, including what they ate, and the scenarios in which their meals took place.</p>
      <p>The results showed that only-children, as well as mothers of only-children were much more likely to be obese than mothers of multiple children, and these children themselves.</p>
      <p>The findings also revealed that only-children were much more likely to eat their meals in front of the TV, and to consume sugary drinks than kids with siblings.</p>
      <p>Dr Kracht added: “Healthier eating behaviors and patterns may result from household-level changes rather than peer exposure, as peer exposure is also present in away-from-home care.”</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that the study only looked at mothers and children, and did not take into account the impact of fathers’ eating patterns.</p>
