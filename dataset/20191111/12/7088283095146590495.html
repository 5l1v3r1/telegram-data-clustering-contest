      <h1>March against Islamophobia attracts support from France's far-left</h1>

        <b>More than 10,000 people marched on Sunday in Paris denouncing 'Islamophobia' and racism in France. The government and most political parties stayed away from the event, excepting the far left.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The demonstrations against Islamophobia were called by a number of individuals and organisations, including the Collective against Islamophobia in France (CCIF).</p>
      <p>The march followed an attack last month on a mosque in the south western French city of Bayonne, where an 84-year-old man shot and wounded two men.</p>
      <p>In Paris, protesters held placards denouncing attacks on Islam.</p>

        <b>The question of the veil</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Muslim veil was a particularly sensitive theme, with a number of women taking part wearing traditional Muslim veils.</p>
      <p>Some even had veils bearing the blue, white and red colours of the French flag.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://en.rfi.fr/france/20191016-secularism-france-new-row-over-wearing-islamic-hijab-school-trips">debate over the veil</a> and the question of radicalisation has been revived in France, a country which has faced several jihadist attacks in recent years.</p>
      <p>"We want to be heard, not pushed to edge of society," said Asmae Eumosid, a veiled woman from the suburbs of Paris</p>
      <p>Nadjet Fella, a nurse who had once campaigned in Algeria against social pressure to wear the veil, was amongst the veiled women in Paris, this time supporting their cause.</p>
      <p>"I chose not to wear it, but it hurts me that those who wear it are picked on," she added.</p>

        <b>France's secular principles</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to recent studies, France has between five and six million Muslims, which makes it the largest Muslim community in Europe.</p>
      <p>However, a landmark law in 1905 decreed the separation of the Church and the French state, laying the grounds for the country's unique secular principles, called 'laicity'.</p>
      <p>For example, France prohibits the wearing of visible religious symbols in public schools, or for civil cervants while on duty.</p>
      <p>This includes the Jewish kippa, the Sikh turban or a visible Christian cross.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Politicians distance themselves, except far-left Mélenchon</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week, the Socialist party formally distanced itself from the demonstration.</p>
      <p>Several members of the government also made it clear they had no sympathy for the march, as did far-right leader Marine Le Pen.</p>
      <p>Critics also accused some of the 50 original signatories to the petition calling for the march of having links to political Islam including the CCIF itself.</p>
      <p>However, a number of far-left politicians, including Jean-Luc Melenchon, the firebrand leader of France Unbowed party, nevertheless joined the Paris rally Sunday.</p>
