      <p>NASHVILLE — To walk in any well-managed forest during November is to confront the inevitability of death.</p>
      <p>This is the month of blank, lowering skies, when the last of the leaves lift and drift away into a drizzly wind. The hardwood trees would normally be bare by mid-November, even in the South, but seasonal cues can be hard to read in this changing climate. It was 98 degrees in Nashville on October 1, and before that the usual September rains never came. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/opinion/hummingbird-migration.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline">I feared there would be no color at all this fall</a>, but I was wrong. The sugar maples have gone golden at last, though not in the bright glory of October. This year they are glowing against gray November skies, each leaf giving off its own light, a tiny sun come to earth.</p>
      <p>The forest understory has died back now, and the contours of the land are evident once more. In November I love to look at the places where rainwater flows downhill to find Otter Creek, and then the Little Harpeth River, and someday — winding through the great Mississippi River watershed — the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, the forest keeps the journey of rainwater a secret, tucks it away under a tangle of green, just as it keeps hidden all the songbird nests that are so visible now against a pewter sky.</p>
      <p>The birds themselves have largely fallen silent, their summertime music giving way to sharper calls of warning whenever a hawk is near. The hawks are always hunting on these gray days when they can fly without casting a shadow, but the chipmunks hear the blue jays’ warning jeer and take note. They stand upright, their tiny forefeet folded to their chests, to take up the cry. Soon the quiet trees are echoing with an unearthly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgoTM4RZF7o"><i>chock, chock, chock</i></a>, a call that always seems far too loud to have emerged from chipmunk lips.</p>
      <p>What happens to the woods in a late autumn drizzle, when dampness hangs in the air like a cloud, is a loveliness like no other, but almost everything in November feels mournful to me. Perhaps because late autumn is the time when my father’s cancer stopped responding to treatment, and when, a decade later, my beloved mother-in-law entered hospice care. Perhaps it is only because my own birthday falls in late October. At 58, I feel the throb of time more acutely with every passing autumn.</p>
      <p>This year that feeling was complicated by a routine medical screening. As I waited for the doctor to call with the pathology report that would clarify whether a long family history of cancer had caught up with me, I looked up his preliminary diagnosis online and scared myself to death.</p>
      <p>I mentioned this turn of events in an email to a friend, exactly my age, who I knew would understand — she had just lost her mother to their own family history of sudden cardiac arrest. “I feel like I’ve reached the age when I have to make friends with death,” she wrote back. “I want to cultivate more of my mother’s fearless embrace of death, though I’m not at all sure how to go about that.”</p>
      <p>I think about her words as I walk each day in the sepia world of November. I think, too, of the words of the poet John Keats, whose great odes were so bound up in the fleeting nature of time, the “weariness, the fever, and the fret” of human life. More than ever these days, I know what he meant when he wrote that “to think is to be full of sorrow / And leaden-eyed despairs.”</p>
      <p>But I have not found my way to being “half in love with easeful Death,” as Keats was. When my doctor called to say the biopsy had come back with no sign of malignancy, relief swept through me like a high November wind. Never mind that such news is only ever a reprieve.</p>
      <p>Maybe it was the sudden sense of death dislodged, however temporarily, that made me look at all the small, seasonal deaths with a sense of kinship. Fallen leaves soften the path I walk on, but not for my sake. The leaves fall to feed the trees, to shelter the tiny creatures who are essential to this forest in a way that I will never be. The misty rain unstiffens the wood of dead trees, making places for nesting woodpeckers to excavate next spring, making a home for the insects that will feed the woodpeckers and so many other living things. I often stop to study the woody shelf fungi growing on the deadwood. I count their rings, like the rings of a felled tree, and know how long they have been growing, how long the death of the tree has been feeding the living creatures of this forest.</p>
      <p>So much life springs from all this death that to spend time in the November woods is also to contemplate <i>im</i>mortality. On the way out of the park last week I passed a red-tailed hawk lying at the base of a power pole, apparently electrocuted, its great wing extended in death. The vultures were already beginning to circle as I passed. I drove on, knowing what would come next, what always comes next: death to life, earth to air, wing to wing.</p>
      <p>November reminds us that the membrane between life and death is permeable, an endless back and forth that makes something of everything, no matter how small, no matter how temporary. To be temporary is only one part of life. There will always be a resurrection.</p>
