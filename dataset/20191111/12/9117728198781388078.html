        <b>Lewis Hamilton says that he is not just going to sit back and relax after securing his sixth world title, with two races left to go in the 2019 season. P2 was enough in the United States for Hamilton to go one behind Michael Schumacher's all time record, but the Brit says 2019 is not over for him yet.</b>

      <p>F1 still has to travel to Brazil and Abu Dhabi before the end of the season, and Hamilton is keen to boost his stats by taking poles and wins in the final events.</p>

      <p>He said back in Austin: <i>“In my mind, I’m just too competitive, so I’m thinking okay, we’ve got two more races to go, how am I going to do a better job, how am I going to improve in qualifying. There’s two more qualifying to try and get pole, how am I going to see if I can potentially pull out a lap like I did in Singapore last year.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“How am I going to work it that I can be at the front of both of those. I’m always just looking to improve and I really love being in this sport. I’m so grateful to this sport for giving me a life and giving my life purpose.”</i>
