      <h1>Barcelona begin preparations for Wednesday's game against Cartagena</h1>
      <h2>The benefit match in the south of Spain will feature several B team players</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:33:36+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:33</time> by <a rel="author">SPORT.es</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona returned to training on Monday without 12 of their internationals but with one eye on Wednesday's friendly against Cartagena (7pm CET).</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde's side will have two training sessions ahead of the fixture, which is a benefit match for victims of the flooding in the south of Spain earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Monday's session included nine B team players: Sergi Puig, Van Beijnen, Chumi, Óscar Mingueza, Jandro, Monchu, Collado, Marqués and Carles Pérez.</p>
      <p>Perez is, of course, a regular with the first team this season, but for all the others, with the exception of Chumi, Wednesday could see them play for the first team for the first time.</p>
