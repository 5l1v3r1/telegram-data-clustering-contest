        <i>Welcome to CHEAP, our series about things that are good, but most of all, cheap. CHEAP!</i>
      </p>
      <p>Today, if you didn’t know, is Singles’ Day. While this really isn’t much of <i>a thing </i>in Europe and the US, it’s big business in China. And, because China is big business, plenty of companies are doing their best to spread it worldwide. Which is great news for you.</p>
      <p>Basically, Singles’ Day is — as the name suggests — a shopping holiday dedicated (I guess) to people who are single. Think of it as a mix between Black Friday and an anti-Valentines.</p>
      <p>And, if you’re on the hunt for a new bit of technology, the price drops that Singles’ Day brings could be enough to make a difference. So, we’ve curated a list of five great deals you can take advantage of today.</p>
