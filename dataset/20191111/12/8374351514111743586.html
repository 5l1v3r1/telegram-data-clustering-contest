      <p>Lucio “Bong” Tan Jr., the newly-appointed President of PAL Holdings Inc. and the son of taipan Lucio Tan, has passed away at the age of 53 after being hospitalized when he fell unconscious during a basketball game last Saturday.</p>
      <p>In a statement, his sister Vivienne K. Tan said: “It is with deep sorrow that I announce the passing of my brother, Lucio “Bong” Tan, Jr. this morning, November 11, 2019. He was 53.”</p>
      <p>“His untimely passing leaves a big void in our hearts and our Group’s management team which would be very hard to fill. Bong was a son, husband, father, friend and, most importantly, our elder brother whom we all relied on for advice, counsel and leadership,” she added.</p>
      <p>He is survived by his wife Julie and sons Hun hun (Lucio Tan III) and Kyle Tan.</p>
      <p>“Our sincerest thanks to all who offered prayers and shared words of comfort during this hour of grief. Our family continues to request everyone to respect our wish for privacy as we go through this very difficult time. We ask for your prayers for the eternal repose of his soul. Wake details will be announced soon,” she said. (James A. Loyola)</p>
