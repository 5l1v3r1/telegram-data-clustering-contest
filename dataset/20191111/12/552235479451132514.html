      <h1>Creetown Gala organisers appeal for new committee members to save century-old festival</h1>
      <h2>Chairman Robert C Ross has warned the event could disappear if more helpers don't come forward</h2>

      <p>Creetown Gala is in the last chance saloon, the committee behind the event has warned.</p>
      <p>The blunt message from chairman Robert C Ross comes days before the gala’s AGM in the Waverley Hall at 7pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross is appealing for more people to help run the week-long community celebration. And he fears that if his plea fails the century-old festival could disappear forever.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “Hopefully we will get a good turnout. We really need a good committee of half a dozen. I would appeal to anyone interested to come along.</p>
      <p>“Ideally we will get some younger people involved.</p>
      <p>“If there’s no committee made on the night I don’t know what’s going to happen.</p>
