      <h1>Jeff Bezos asked Michael Bloomberg to consider running for president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:23:10+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos asked former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-i-welcome-bloomberg-into-the-race">consider running for president</a>.</p>
      <p>Bezos, the world’s richest man, called Bloomberg months ago to ask him to consider entering the 2020 presidential race, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/9/20956153/mike-bloomberg-president-2020-jeff-bezos-phone-call-amazon-hq2">according to Vox</a>.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, turned down the request at the time, but months later the billionaire is preparing to enter the race. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bloomberg-files-for-2020-democratic-primary-in-alabama">He filed paperwork</a> last week with the Alabama Democratic Party to have his name on the primary ballot in the state.</p>
      <p>Despite the move, Bloomberg has yet to make a final decision on whether to join the race.</p>
      <p>The former New York politician, who is worth an estimated $52 billion, is expected to fund his own campaign if he runs for the White House.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what prompted Bezos’ call urging Bloomberg to enter the race. It’s also not known whether the conversation took place before or after Bloomberg said March 5 that he would not run.</p>
