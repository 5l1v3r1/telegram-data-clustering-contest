        <b>It comes at a hefty price</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/calvin-harris">Calvin Harris</a> has accidentally shared a sneek peak of <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/apple">Apple</a>‘s new Mac Pro.</p>
      <p>The superstar DJ and producer shared a video on his Instagram stories, which showed off his studio and eagle eyed fans spotted the new Mac Pro 2019 on the floor next to Harris’ desk.</p>
      <p>Harris doesn’t acknowledge the Mac in the footage, but the cheese-grater style design is the same as the machine and seemingly confirms that the chart-topping DJ has been given a trial run with it.</p>
      <p>When Apple announced it back in September, it had a $5999 price tag in the US. The Pro Display XDR, a new 6K external monitor with a starting price tag of $4,999, and a Pro Stand that costs $999 are expected to launch alongside the new Mac Pro.</p>
      <p>No prices for the Mac Pro have been announced in the UK yet.</p>

      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/apple-announces-airpods-pro-noise-cancellation-2562075">Apple announced AirPods Pro</a>, a new version of the company’s wireless earbuds with added noise cancellation functions.</p>
      <p>The earbuds are priced at around £193 ($249), and are now available to order on <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWP22AM/A/airpods-pro">Apple’s website</a>.</p>
      <p>Apple also recently launched the Mac software update Catalina, which <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/apple-officially-phases-out-itunes-in-new-mac-software-update-2554856">phases out iTunes</a> and distributes its functions across three different apps.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, earlier this year, Harris revealed that he used to live off <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/i-lived-on-whiskey-and-greggs-pasties-calvin-harris-on-why-he-doesnt-sing-live-any-more-2426972">whiskey and Greggs pasties</a> during his early years as a live vocalist and DJ.</p>
      <p>Responding to a fan on Twitter who said they missed the Scottish artist singing live, he wrote: “The last thing I want to do is down 2 bottles of jack daniels a night, live on greggs pasties and sleep on an absolutely stinking bus all year, scream down a mic for 55 minutes and pretend to play a keyboard 5x a week those days are behind me son.”</p>
      <p>Later in the thread, Harris said that Greggs pasties and booze “got me in a right old state” and discouraged anyone from copying his behaviour.</p>
