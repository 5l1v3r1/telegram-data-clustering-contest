      <h1>GOP Rep. Peter King Won’t Seek Reelection in 2020</h1>
      <h2>(AP) —New York Rep. Peter King announced Monday he will not seek reelection in 2020.</h2>

      <p>The 14-term Republican congressman said in a Facebook post that his commute was a main factor in his decision, saying he wants “flexibility to spend more time” with his children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>“The prime reason for my decision was that after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford,” he wrote in the post.</p>
      <p>He’s represented parts of Long Island since 1993 and is the longest-serving Republican member of New York’s congressional delegation.</p>
      <p>He has cultivated a reputation for bipartisanship while maintaining a hard line on immigration and crime — winning issues in New York’s 2nd Congressional District, which covers suburban Long Island about an hour’s drive east of Manhattan.</p>
      <p>King, 75, is the former chair of the House Homeland Security Committee.</p>
      <p>At least 20 House Republicans have announced they will not seek reelection. Three other GOP lawmakers have resigned.</p>
