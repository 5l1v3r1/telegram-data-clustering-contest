      <p>DUESSELDORF (Nov 11): Malaysia’s plastic manufacturers seem to be quickly grasping the changing needs of their customers, as well as the latest technological breakthroughs, driven by a demanding public which sees the plastics industry as one of the contributors to environmental degradation, particularly in the oceans where the sea-life faces a grim future thanks to the unscrupulous dumping of plastics in the waters.</p>
      <p>This was apparent at the recent K’19 Plastics + Rubber Fair of Duesseldorf — rated as the world’s biggest trade show for plastic and rubber industries — where members of the Malaysian plastic industry participated and fared well.</p>
      <p>“The mantra is recycling,” Andreas Rauschenbach, a Bavaria based researcher in the plastics industry told Bernama.</p>
      <p>This shift in perception of plastics is something Malaysian plastics manufacturers already seemed to be conscious of.</p>
      <p>Indeed, a Malaysian company went the extra mile and strategized its participation at the fair by creating a special theme that would appeal to buyers and the general public alike.</p>
      <p>Johor Baru-based Heng Hiap Industries Sdn Bhd, which manufactures customized polypropylene (PP) compounds used in manufacture of home appliances, automotive, construction and for other industrial applications, created the theme “Traceable Ocean Plastics” for its products at the K' 2’19 show.</p>
      <p>“We conceived the theme of ‘Traceable Ocean Plastics’ which also reflects our emphasis on reducing the toxic burden on our environment and on our planet, by emphasizing the importance of recycling,” Kian Siah, Heng Hiap’s managing director, explained in an interview with <i>Bernama </i>on the sidelines of the show.</p>
      <p>The company works with collectors, who pick and collect waste in and around the sea in Malaysia, and recycles the picked up items into sustainable PP compounds. The collectors are independent and unattached, unlike In Europe where “you have structured collectors”, as Siah put it.</p>
      <p>Plastic manufacturers worldwide are resorting to novel ways to cast themselves in an environment-friendly light.</p>
      <p>“There is a general consensus in Europe, for example, to reduce the fossil-based prime material made from naphtha, crude oil, shell oil, etc. Europeans, as we found out, are reducing the use of virgin-based materials.</p>
      <p>“The alternative is recycled material which is getting a lot of attention in the plastics industry. Malaysian suppliers are also aware of the importance of traceable material whose origin can be easily tracked down. Environmental, economic and social considerations are becoming a trend.</p>
      <p>“Traceability is the key word. We use a barcode for our products to facilitate the consumers to trace the origin of our materials. I must say that the plastics industry has moved in a dynamic manner in the last 40 years,” Siah noted.</p>
      <p>The plastics expert observed that the plastics business was transformed from a product-centric model to a live-cycle model. This, he explained, was achievable through the “4 Cs” — collection, conversion, co-creation and championing (by big brands such as Unilever, etc.). The barcode has become an important key to tracking the genesis of materials, for example, used in the lifestyle furniture and other industries.</p>
      <p>“Thus, the end product comes with a ‘birth certificate’, if you will, in the form of the barcode.”</p>
      <p>Siah was “extremely happy” with his company’s participation in the K’2019 show, which he described as the Olympics of the plastics industry.</p>
      <p>“This is an international venue where you meet visitors from around the world. Our booth attracted visitors from 43 countriesincluding Europeans, Asians and Americans,” he said.</p>
      <p>His company received confirmed orders. He said that it had been a “great advantage” for his company to have participated under the Malaysia Pavilion organized by the Frankfurt-based Malaysian External Trade Development Corp. (Matrade) because the stream of crowd that kept pouring in could see the biodegradable products under his company’s theme of Traceable Ocean Plastics. Twelve Malaysian exhibitors had participated under Matrade’s umbrella, while two participated on their own.</p>
      <p>Heng Hiap, which exports its products to 33 countries, collects some 60,000 tons of plastic scrap from domestic sources. Half of this quantity is converted into end products – high-performance plastics resins — with a large chunk shipped as end products to Europe, pan-Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Korea and Japan.</p>
      <p>Siah said his company was participating for the third time at the plastics and rubber fair, which is held every three years.</p>
      <p>“We came with low expectations because of the ongoing global economic slowdown accompanied by the sentiments against plastics which are, generally, seen as harming the environment. But I am leaving Duesseldorf with a high level of satisfaction with my company’s participation,” he said. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
