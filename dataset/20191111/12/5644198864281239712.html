      <p>ATHENS: Greece is a "natural ally" in China's global trade expansion plans, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday (Nov 11) during a three-day state visit.</p>
      <p>"Both China and Greece see each other as natural allies in developing the Belt and Road," Xi said at the start of a state visit aimed at deepening cooperation with Greece across the board, adding his desire to "keep the momentum going" and "reinforce" bilateral relations.</p>

      <p>Greece is one of the backers of China's Belt and Road plan for a massive network of ports, railways, roads and industrial parks spanning Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe that will see trillions invested in new infrastructure across 126 countries.</p>
      <p>Greek and Chinese delegations signed over a dozen agreements, including an extradition accord, agricultural export deals and an agreement to open the first Bank of China branch in Athens.</p>
      <p>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will also open a representative office in Greece, officials said.</p>
      <p>The agreements signed Monday will "unleash potential in energy, transport and financial cooperation," Xi said.</p>
      <p>"The road we open will soon become a highway," said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.</p>
      <p>The Chinese foreign ministry had earlier noted that Xi's visit to Athens will have "historical significance" for the development of China-Greece relations, and will also "inject new impetus" into the development of China-EU relations and Beijing's "Belt and Road" initiative.</p>
      <p>"Relations with Greece are a priority for China," Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias told Thema radio on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"They came and invested in Greece when others stayed away" during the economic crisis, Dendias said.</p>

        <b>'HOW CAN I HELP YOU?'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Xi's visit comes on the heels of a four-day trip to Shanghai by Greece's new conservative Prime Minister Mitsotakis last week at the head of a delegation of more than 60 businessmen.</p>
      <p>Elected in July, Mitsotakis has made foreign investment and privatisation a linchpin of his administration's policy to restore Greece's sluggish economy to growth after a gruelling 10-year crisis.</p>
      <p>"I want the first words by Greek authorities to those who come to invest to be 'how can I help you?'" said Mitsotakis, who plans to visit China again in April.</p>
      <p>Greece has been building progressively closer trade relations with China for more than a decade, spearheaded by a 2008 deal by a previous conservative government to cede container terminals at the main port of Piraeus to Chinese shipping giant Cosco.</p>
      <p>Mitsotakis was set to tour the facilities with Xi later on Monday.</p>
      <p>Cosco has already invested some €600 million (US$660 million) in Piraeus, creating 3,000 jobs, and the total could reach one billion euros, Mitsotakis said during his Shanghai visit.</p>
      <p>According to the Greek government, Greek shipowners have also built more than 1,000 vessels worth over US$50 billion (€45 billion) in China in the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'GOLDEN VISA'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Greece hopes to increase the number of direct flights between the two countries as it aims for the number of Chinese who visit to rise by more than a quarter to 250,000 per year.</p>
      <p>Over 5,000 Chinese have purchased property in Greece, taking advantage of a five-year 'Golden Visa' residence programme launched in 2013.</p>
      <p>Cosco in 2008 acquired Piraeus' two main container terminals on a 35-year lease. In 2016 it also took over the Piraeus port authority - and the third remaining container terminal - until 2052.</p>
      <p>Greece has also signed up to China's new "Belt and Road" project, a US$1 trillion global investment programme aiming to forward Chinese goods to markets further afield.</p>
      <p>After Greece, Xi will travel to the BRICS summit in Brazil from Nov 13 to 14.</p>
      <p>Xi will attend the closing ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum, the closed-door meeting of leaders from Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, as well as a public meeting, and issue a joint declaration.</p>
