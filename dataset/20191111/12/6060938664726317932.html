      <h1>This bride's white and pink sari is what dreams are made of!</h1>

      <p>Over the last few years, white colour has made its way to Indian weddings. From dreamy lehengas to saris, brides are now ditching the red shade for this milky shade. We recently came across a bride's sari look in white colour, which is just gorgeous and stunning. Bride Catherine Dayal picked up a beautiful Sabyasachi sari for her wedding in Bangalore.</p>
      <p>She looked resplendent in the white sari which had a tint of pink hue. She wore the sheer sari over a printed white skirt underneath. The pallu features 3D embellished flowers on the border. She wore the sari with a full-sleeved blouse, which featured Sabya's signature embroidery and 3D white flowers.</p>

      <p>Keeping her look minimal, the bride kept the rest of her look simple. Her look was accessorised with golden jhumkas and a long necklace. When it came to her make-up, she sported a simple look with soft shimmery eyes, a bindi and a bold lip colour. For her hairdo, she sported a bun adorned with gajra flowers.</p>
