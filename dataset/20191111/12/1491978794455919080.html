      <p>Shakhtar Donetsk’s Taison was sent off on Sunday after reacting to racist insults from the crowd. The Brazilian midfielder raised a finger to Dynamo Kyiv fans before kicking the ball into the stands. Taison, 31, has played in Ukraine since 2011, and left the field in tears with his Brazilian teammate Dentinho also visibly upset. Following Uefa-recommended protocol, the referee then took the players to the dressing room for five minutes, Fare said, before dismissing Taison and restarting the game which Shakhtar won 1-0. The third step of the protocol would have been to abandon the match</p>
