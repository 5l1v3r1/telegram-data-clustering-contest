      <h1>Watch live: Mercury transits the Sun in rare astronomical event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:59:15+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Rafael Cereceda </a></address>
      <p>A rare astronomical event is currently taking place, as the solar system’s smallest planet Mercury passes in front of the sun.</p>
      <p>The predictable phenomenon only occurs 13 times each century. It last happened in 2016, but the next time Mercury transits the sun will be in 13 years’ time in 2032.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>You can watch the event, which started at 13:35 CET (12:35 GMT), on one of the livestreams below.</i>

      <p>In Europe you will be able to see the beginning of the transit, and on the west coast of North America you will be able to see the end.</p>
      <p>It will be seen in its entirety in the Canary Islands, the east coast of the United States, Central America and South America.</p>
      <p>Space enthusiasts will want to get a glimpse of the rare phenomenon, and there are a number of ways to do so. However, it is crucial that planet-watchers don’t try to watch the event outside with their own eyes without specific equipment.</p>
      <h3>How to watch the event safely</h3>
      <p>Firstly and most importantly, looking at the Sun can cause serious damage to the eyes, and trying to capture an image on a phone can even damage the phone’s camera. Secondly, Mercury is too small to be seen with the naked eye, and it doesn’t darken the sun in the same way as a solar eclipse caused by the moon.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to watch the five-hour transit is with one of the livestreams above.</p>
      <p>You could also join a viewing event, which will have the correct equipment set up - get in touch with a local astronomy group.</p>
      <p>To watch it with your own equipment, you'll need a telescope or binoculars, with at least 50x magnification, fitted with a solar filter.</p>
      <p>This map of the Spanish National Geographic Institute shows the transit times.</p>
