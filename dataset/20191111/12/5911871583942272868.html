      <p>“Ain’t no next life, so now I’m tryna live my best life.” So goes the hook from “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058458/danny-brown-best-life/music/">Best Life</a>,” Danny Brown’s philosophical materialist anthem from the recent <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2060288/danny-brown-uknowhatimsayin-review/franchises/premature-evaluation/"><i>uknowhatimsayin¿</i></a> Like lead single “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2057272/danny-brown-uknowhatimsayin-dirty-laundry/video/">Dirty Laundry</a>,” it’s produced by Q-Tip. And like “Dirty Laundry,” it now has a music video.</p>
      <p>Unlike “Dirty Laundry,” this one is more serious in tone. As with much of Brown’s work, “Best Life” seems like a lot of fun on the surface, but the specter of death lingers. That’s emphasized by Augustin Vita’s video, a series of street-life scenes cut with images of Brown and others surrounded by floral arrangements, plus some spinning closeups of Brown that paint a more severe portrait than the wild-eyed theatrics he made his name on.</p>
