      <h1>Brexit Party will not fight seats won by Tories in 2017, Nigel Farage announces</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:38:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has said the Brexit Party will not contest the 317 seats won by the Conservatives at the last UK general election.</p>
      <p>The announcement means he has abandoned plans to contest more than 600 candidates in the upcoming ballot.</p>
      <p>Speaking to supporters in Hartlepool he said the party would not stand in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in the last election in 2017.</p>
      <p>He said he had taken the decision because he feared that if they had run it would have led to a hung Parliament with significant gains for the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>The move is a significant boost for Boris Johnson amid warnings by Conservative ministers that they risked splitting the Brexit vote.</p>

      <p>“We’ve decided ourselves that we absolutely have to put country before party and take the fight to Labour,” Mr Farage said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, millionaire and former Farage ally Arron Banks is set to advise voters in hundreds of seats to vote for Boris Johnson over the Brexit Party.</p>
      <p>Mr Banks is preparing to unveil a tactical voting app in a bid to give the Prime Minister a majority of pro-Brexit MPs in order to push his Withdrawal Agreement through.</p>
      <p>"We have to get Boris a majority so we can get Brexit done."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Boris Johnson has pledged to change the law to protect Armed Forces veterans from vexatious legal action as he announced a raft of measures to support military personnel.</p>
      <p>The Tories want to end unfair trials of veterans where no new evidence has been produced and the accusations have been questioned exhaustively in court.</p>
