      <h1>Brexit Party will not fight seats won by Conservatives in 2017, says Nigel Farage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:48:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:48</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Cordon, Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has abandoned plans for the Brexit Party to contest more than 600 candidates in the forthcoming general election.</p>
      <p>Speaking to supporters in Hartlepool he said the party would not stand in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in the last election in 2017.</p>
      <p>He said he had taken the decision because he feared that if they had run it would have led to a hung Parliament with significant gains for the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>The move is a significant boost for Boris Johnson amid warnings by Conservative ministers that they risked splitting the Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said: "I think our action, this announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening.</p>
      <p>"And that to me, I think right now, is the single most important thing in our country.</p>
      <p>"So in a sense we now have a Leave alliance, it's just that we've done it unilaterally.</p>
      <p>"We've decided ourselves that we absolutely have to put country before party and take the fight to Labour."</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said Mr Johnson's move towards a free trade deal with the European Union that did not include regulatory alignment was a "significant change" to the approach on Brexit.</p>
      <p>"He said we would negotiate a super Canada-plus trade deal with no political alignment," said the Brexit Party leader.</p>
      <p>"That is a huge change. Ever since Mrs May's abject speech in Florence, we have been aiming at a close and special partnership with the European Union.</p>
      <p>"We had been aiming to stay part of many of its agencies.</p>
      <p>"Boris last night signalled a very clear change in direction. I thought to myself overnight, 'That sounds a bit more like the Brexit we voted for'."</p>
      <p>Following today's announcement, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: "Any form of Brexit that is acceptable to Nigel Farage will be deeply damaging for Scotland.</p>
      <p>"Makes it all the more important to get rid of Boris Johnson's Tories, escape Brexit and put Scotland's future into Scotland's hands."</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tweeted: "The Conservative Party are the Brexit Party now." </p>
      <p>Supporters in the room backed Nigel Farage's announcement, calling him a "good strategist".</p>
      <p>Brexit Party supporter Rachel Swann (48) from Redcar, said: "It would be great to see him contesting every seat but this is logical, a lot of people are concerned we are splitting the Leave vote.</p>
      <p>"He is a good strategist, it's one I can live with."</p>
      <p>Robert Kenny (64) from Hartlepool, watched the speech and said afterwards: "I think he got a bit of a surprise, he might have thought the reaction in the room was going to be against."</p>
      <p>His son Christopher (39) added: "I'm pretty pleased he has done it.</p>
      <p>"We want out and that seems to be the best way of going about it, as long as Boris can keep his word."</p>
