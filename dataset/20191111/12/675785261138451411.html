      <p>The 43-year-old star, who has played Michelle Connor on the ITV soap since 2006, enjoyed a night of partying with her fellow Corrie co-stars at the Great John Street Hotel in Manchester after wrapping up her scenes.</p>
      <p>Upon her departure, the former Hear'Say singer reflected on her time on the cobbles and how the show "was a safety net during tough times."</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news">OK! magazine</a> , who were at the bash, Kym told: "When you go through bad times, you still have to go into work as life goes on."</p>

      <p>Sharing on how the cast and crew are like a 'second-family' to her, she added: "When I lost Archie [Kym’s son who died in 2009 following a premature birth at 21 weeks], I took some time off, but when I went back, the cast and crew were the people I relied on. They still know to hug me on Archie’s birthday."</p>
      <p>For the party Kym ensured she put on glamorous display in a black wrap dress embellished with sequins which she teamed with platform boots.</p>
      <p>Joining her were Lucy Fallon, who plays Bethany Platt, and Tina O'Brien, who portrays Sarah-Louise Platt.</p>
