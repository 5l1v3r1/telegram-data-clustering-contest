      <h1>Google Limits the Pixel 4's Brightness to Extend its Battery Life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:30:03+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Whenman</a></address>
      <p>Since its <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/pixel-4-pixel-4-xl-launch-announcement/">launch last month</a>, Google's latest flagship, the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/tag/pixel-4/">Pixel 4</a>, early adopters haven't been shy about highlighting its issues, including <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/google-says-it-will-fix-pixel-4s-face-unlock-fail-in-the-coming-months/">face unlock that works even when the user is dead</a>, the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/pixel-4-refresh-rate-low-brightness/">deliberately throttled 90Hz refresh rate</a> and a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/does-the-pixel-4-have-a-bending-issue/">possible bending snafu</a>. Giz UK editor <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/author/tom-pritchard/">Tom Pritchard</a> has a great rundown of these and other concerns in his <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/pixel-4-stupid-issues-google-not-trying-hard-enough/">comprehensive overview of where the Pixel 4 falls short</a>.</p>
      <p>To those issues can now be added the revelation that the smartphone has a high brightness mode it seems to have purposefully hidden from users. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-4-high-brightness-mode-fix/">Mishaal Rahman at XDA</a> dug into the Pixel 4's code and discovered Google has limited the screen's brightness to a relatively paltry 444 nits. Nits is a measurement of visible light's intensity and, for comparison, the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/tag/galaxy-s10/">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> can reach up to 1,215 nits when it needs to. 444 nits is fine for most conditions, but in direct sunlight it can make the phone hard to see, especially when watching videos or viewing photos, and reviewers have picked up on this.</p>
      <p>However, when de-limited, the Pixel 4 can reach around 610 nits, which is still lower than the competition, but an appreciable difference. The only way to access it without rooting your device is by playing HDR video, as Google decided not to offer an option to manually enable it in Settings or even trigger it through Adaptive Brightness.</p>
      <p>Google seems to have limited the Pixel 4's capabilities for one simple reason: its battery is shit. The Pixel 4 carries a battery that bizarrely is actually slightly smaller than the Pixel 3 (although the Pixel 4 XL does at least offer an improvement over its predecessor) and well behind other Android flagships, so it desperately needs to save juice wherever it can.</p>
      <p>It looks like Google will be offering a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/google-pixel-4-black-friday-sale/">hefty discount on the Pixel 4 during Black Friday</a>, but this and the smartphone's many other issues suggest you might want to think carefully before taking advantage of the upcoming deal.
