      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, Mokwena, who was on the losing side on the day, credited his players for how hard they have fought despite results not going their way.</p>
      <p>“There’s a certain way that Orlando Pirates must lose football matches, not by allowing opponents to bully them, there is a certain way that we have to respond to the game and there’s a certain way we play particularly because we have prepared in a certain way,” Mokwena told the media.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to beat ourselves up and when we lose, we lose to a better opponent and like I said, Kaizer Chiefs are good enough to beat us on tactics. They beat Sundowns six on tactics and okay, other related issues it is not my business, but this is a strong Kaizer Chiefs team. </p>
      <p>“They made rotations, eight rotations against Chippa United and they beat them. But we don’t accept to be bullied over and allowed to change. But yes, the way you lose a match, you have to lose it with dignity and pride and credit to the players for that,” he added. </p>
