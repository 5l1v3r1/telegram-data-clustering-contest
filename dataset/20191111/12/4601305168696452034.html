      <p>Uber is significantly backed by Saudi investments and the country's sovereign wealth fund controls a seat on its board. In this video, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi is asked by Axios's Dan Primack about the Saudi regime's murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S.-based journalist and dissident.</p>
      <p>"It's a serious mistake," Khosrowshahi said. "We've made mistakes too, right? With self-driving, and we're recovering from that mistake ... So I think that people make mistakes. It doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they've taking is seriously."</p>
      <p>Primack challenged his comparison of a political assassination, as described in a CIA report, to the presumptively accidental killing of a pedestrian by a self-driving car.</p>
      <p>"I didn't read that part of the CIA report," Khosrowshahi said. "You're obviously deeper in it."</p>
      <p>Khosrowshahi, however, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958976/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-saudi-arabia-murder-jamal-khashoggi-serious-mistake">is now very deep in something else.</a></p>
      <blockquote>Khosrowshahi later backtracked, telling Axios after the interview had ended that he had misspoken. “I said something in the moment that I do not believe,” said the CEO in a statement. “When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused.”</blockquote>
