      <p>SYDNEY -- Two people have been charged with first-degree murder in connection with the death of a man in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Cape Breton Regional Police say the man was found dead inside an apartment on Rotary Drive last Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>The victim has been identified as 41-year-old Stephen Richard Rose of Sydney.</p>
      <p>Police arrested a 33-year-old woman in New Waterford on Friday and a 37-year-old man in Sydney on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Jessica Anne MacDonald and Joey Frederick Evong have each been charged with first-degree murder in Rose’s death.</p>
      <p>MacDonald and Evong have been remanded to the Cape Breton Correctional Centre. They are due to appear in Sydney provincial court on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Police say the murder wasn’t a random act, as the suspects and victim are known to each other, and they aren’t looking for any additional suspects.</p>
      <p>The victim's brother, Richard Rose, says he his family are still in shock.</p>
      <p>He says what's even more shocking is that two people have been charged in his brother's death.</p>
      <p>"I'm angry of course," said Rose. "I'm sad. He's left behind four beautiful boys. That's what angers me that most. They have to grow up without him now."</p>
      <p>How Stephen Rose died that night remains a mystery to his family.</p>
      <p>Richard Rose says his brother didn't live at the apartment on Rotary Drive and was visiting a friend at the time.</p>
      <p>"His character I don't think would've ever allowed something like this and that's the real shocker for me," said Richard Rose.</p>
      <p>Funeral arrangements have not yet been finalized for Stephen Rose, but his brother says his family has already been overwhelmed by public support.</p>
      <p>"He had many people in his corner," Richard Rose said. "I've been shown nothing but love from coast-to-coast."</p>
