      <h1>Kenya Has One of the Fastest Growing Software Developer Communities on GitHub</h1>

      <p>The tech industry in Africa has seen tremendous growth over the years. We have seen the American company<a href="https://techweez.com/?s=andela"> Andela</a> set up shop in the continent to recruit developers. Google has an AI lab in the continent. <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/05/14/microsoft-adc-nigeria-nairobi/">Microsoft recently opened up an Africa Development Centre in Kenya and Nigeria</a>. <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/11/08/amazon-aws-edge-location-kenya/#">Amazon</a> is scheduled to open an AWS region in South Africa in 2020. Clearly there is a lot of potential in this content. Developer hubs are all over the continent and recently <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/09/26/nigeria-cchub-acquires-kenyas-ihub/">ccHub bought Kenya’s own iHub</a>.</p>
      <p>This potential is shown by the ever expanding developer communities in Africa. One of the well known developer communities is Github and they have interesting stats about their community.</p>
      <p>According to the Octoverse report by GitHub, Africa is doing quite well. Developers have created 40% more open source repositories than last year, which is a higher percentage growth than any other continent.</p>
      <p>In the ‘larger developer communities’ in Africa (over 10K contributors), Morocco is the fastest growing African country with a 65% rise year on year. <b>Kenya</b> is second with <b>54%</b> rise while Nigeria is third with 50%. These ‘larger developer countries’ in the continent saw a collective 70% increase in contributers year on year.</p>
      <p>Kenya is also among the top regions where open source is growing. GitHub saw a 44% rise in open source projects by Kenyans, which ties the country in second with Iran. Nigeria leads this list with 59%.</p>
      <p>African countries with less than 10K contributers has also seen a tremendous rise in the number of contributors. Mayotte leads with 638% increase, Guinea Bissau is next with a 550% increase while Seychelles is third with a 369% increase.</p>
      <p>In general, 10 million new developers joined GitHub and collectively they have contributed to over 44 million repositories across the world. 80% of these developers are contributing from outside the US</p>
