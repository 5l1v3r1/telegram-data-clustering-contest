      <p>Lucio “Bong” Tan Jr., the newly appointed President of PAL Holdings, Inc. and the son of taipan Lucio Tan, passed away on Monday at the age of 53 after being hospitalized when he fell unconscious during a basketball game last Saturday.</p>
      <p>In a statement, his sister Vivienne K. Tan said: “It is with deep sorrow that I announce the passing of my brother, Lucio “Bong” Tan, Jr. this morning, November 11, 2019. He was 53.”</p>
      <p>“His untimely passing leaves a big void in our hearts and our Group’s management team which would be very hard to fill. Bong was a son, husband, father, friend and, most importantly, our elder brother whom we all relied on for advice, counsel, and leadership,” she added. He is survived by his wife Julie and sons Hun hun (Lucio Tan III) and Kyle Tan.</p>
      <p>“Our sincerest thanks to all who offered prayers and shared words of comfort during this hour of grief.

Wake details will be announced soon,” she said.</p>

      <p>On top of that, he was also Presi­dent and COO of other members of the Lucio Tan Group of Companies, including Tanduay Distillers, Inc. and Eton Properties Philippines, Inc.</p>
      <p>He was also Treasurer and Chair­man of the Mining Committee of Mac­roAsia Corporation and a member of the Executive Committee of Foremost Farms, Inc.</p>
      <p>Tan also served on the Board of Directors of the following corpora­tions: Airport Specialist Services Corporation (since June 2000); Allied Bankers Insurance Corporation (since 1992); Air Philippines Corporation (since 2004), LT Group, Inc.

      <p>“The Palace has been informed of the passing of Mr. Lucio “Bong” Tan Jr., President and Chief Operat­ing Officer of PAL Holdings, Inc., this morning, November 11, following his admission to a hospital after he collapsed while playing basketball, a sport he dearly loved, during the weekend,” Presidential apokesman Salvador Panelo said.</p>
      <p>“The Office of the President ex­presses its deep condolences and heartfelt sympathies to the Tan fam­ily, especially to Mr. Lucio Tan, his wife and his children, on the untimely demise of Mr. Bong Tan at the age of 53,” he added.</p>
      <p>Panelo remembered Tan as a humble person “with a serious mien but with a ready smile to whom so ever he met in social events and official functions.” He added that Tan never threw his weight around and offered help to anyone in need.</p>
      <p>“He was a good friend, a kind-hearted brother to his siblings, a lov­ing and dutiful son to his parents, and an efficient and competent corporate man,” Panelo said.</p>
      <p>“As family, friends, and colleagues pay tribute to the life of Mr. Bong Tan, we fervently ask the Almighty to grant him eternal repose and pray that perpetual light shine upon him as he rests in happiness and peace,” he added.<i> (With a report from Genalyn Kabiling)</i></p>
