      <h1>Green Brigade are disrespecting lost Celtic heroes and should be ashamed of their vile poppy chants - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Gavin Berry answered your calls and many Celtic fans were unimpressed with the behaviour of their ultras group.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T12:07:51+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>The annual poppy row involving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans erupted again as the Green Brigade came under fire for their conduct during their side’s clash with Motherwell. </p>
      <p>Celtic’s ultras group opted to stay away during the Remembrance Day minute’s silence before singing an anti-poppy chant when they finally entered Parkhead. </p>
      <p>The Hoops won 2-0 against the Steelmen to remain a goal ahead of rivals Rangers, who beat Livingston by the same scoreline, at the top of the Scottish Premiership. </p>
      <p>But yet again a section of the support came under fire over a lack of respect to those who died in conflict with one Celtic supporter on the Hotline even criticising his fellow fans. </p>
      <p><b>Tomas Marshall</b> emailed: “I went to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> game with a poppy on and was slaughtered by my fellow Celtic fans. How disrespectful and ignorant these people are. </p>
      <p>“They have no place in society, never mind football. This must be highlighted because it’s a total disgrace and happens every year.”</p>

      <p><b>John Thomson</b> emailed: “At football matches all over the country at the weekend a minute’s silence silence was observed with the respect and gratitude it merited and deserved. </p>
      <p>“The vast majority at Celtic Park also observed the tribute with dignity but not long into the game we could hear the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/green-brigade">Green Brigade</a> signing vile anti-poppy chants.</p>
      <p>“This is the same group of people who unfurled a banner a few years ago stating that they did not respect the British army or their poppies. </p>
      <p>“At the time Peter Lawwell stated the club would weed out these people and ban them from Celtic Park but to date nobody has ever been banned. </p>
      <p>“Obviously money is more important than the memory of those who died in two world conflicts.”</p>
      <p><b>James Forsyth, Bellshill,</b> said: “How long can Celtic put up with the Green Brigade? Celts died in the Great War and many fans are in the forces today. </p>
      <p>“Stay away if they want but cut out the vile chants. I wonder what Sir Rod Stewart thinks of them now.”</p>

      <p><b>Samuel Logan, Peterborough,</b> said: “For a team that lost players in the Great War it is unbelievable that a section of the Celtic support disrespect Remembrance Day.”</p>
      <p><b>Jock Gray, Falkirk,</b> said: “Do the morons in the Green Brigade not realise that their poppy protest is an insult to all the Celtic fans and former players who died for them.”</p>
      <p><b>Mark Lambert, Elgin,</b> said: “I’m disgusted with the anti-poppy song that came from the Green Brigade during the Motherwell match. </p>
      <p>“They need to remember ex-Celtic players gave their lives for us during world wars.”</p>
      <p><b>Mark Watson, Rutherglen,</b> said: “Can someone explain why Celtic are practically the only team in Britain who don’t wear poppies on their shirts? It’s a disgrace.”</p>
      <p>On the park, it’s nip and tuck at the top of the table but <b>Steve McSherry, Uddingston,</b> said: “As a Celtic fan I’m disappointed that Hibs, Hearts and Aberdeen have fallen away. We need teams to present a challenge to keep us on our toes. </p>
      <p>“Rangers are giving us a bit of a challenge but I can’t see them sustaining that throughout the season.”</p>
      <p>But Gers fans are confident their team can keep pace with their rivals and <b>Alan McGaw, Alloa,</b> said: “It was a fantastic seven days for Rangers with three wins in three different competitions and no goals conceded. </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">“Alfredo Morelos</a> was once again the golden boy as he continues to do his talking with his feet. He’s doing what he’s paid to do which is score goals.</p>
      <p>“He was maybe slightly offside but I couldn’t believe he scored from what looked like an impossible angle.”</p>
      <p>Steven Gerrard called for referee protection before the trip to West Lothian after Joe Aribo picked up a nasty head knock on their previous visit. </p>
      <p><b>Harry Fitzpatrick, Canada,</b> emailed: “When will the SFA have a word with Steven Gerrard? His statements before the Livingston game regarding protection from his players were out of order. </p>
      <p>“He was trying to intimidate the referee. Who does this guy think he is?”</p>
      <p><b>Jim Robertson</b> emailed: “In the space of a week we’ve had Connor Goldson and Joe Aribo saying that Scottish football is physical. </p>
      <p>“If we want to succeed in Europe at club and international level then we have to, not abandon that aspect of our game but concentrate more on skill and quality. </p>
      <p>“People may say that is part of the Scottish game but it is also what is holding us back.”</p>
