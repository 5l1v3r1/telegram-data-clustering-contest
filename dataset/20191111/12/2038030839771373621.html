      <p>Cape Town – Lizzo is on the cover of Vogue and feeling 'Good as Hell'.</p>
      <p>The singer, rapper and songwriter appears on the December cover in a black Versace gown and an Adrienne Landau feather boa, and talks music, hard work and representation.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://theglowup.theroot.com/lizzo-on-the-cover-of-british-vogue-may-be-the-only-gif-1839708881"><b>The Root</b></a>, very few plus-sized bodies have featured on the cover of Vogue. Even <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/from-the-archives-oprah-winfrey-in-vogue"><b>Oprah dropped to a size six for her cover in 1998</b></a>, and the talk show host we know and love doesn’t really look like herself. But that’s precisely why it was so important for Lizzo to feature on the cover and the Truth Hurts singer knows it.</p>
      <p>In her <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/lizzo-british-vogue-interview"><b>interview</b></a>, Lizzo spoke about seeing women, or rather, not seeing women that look like her.</p>
      <p>"I would watch things on television and I would look at magazines and I would not see myself. When you don’t see yourself, you start to think something’s wrong with you. Then you want to look like those things and when you realise it’s a physical impossibility, you start to think, 'What the fuck is wrong with me?' I think that took a greater toll on me, psychologically, growing up than what anyone could have said to me," she said.</p>
      <p>But her attitude has since changed, though she is still sceptical about using the label "body positive".</p>
      <p>"Anybody that uses body positivity to sell something is using it for their personal gain. That’s just it. We weren’t selling anything in the beginning. We were just selling ourselves and selling ourselves on the idea – selling ourselves on ourselves, you know?</p>
      <p>"I’m not trying to sell you me," she says. "I’m trying to sell you, you."</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old shared more images from the shoot on Instagram.</p>
      <p>On one she wrote, "I’m a custom couture bad n bougeé bitch eatin maruchan ramen wit a pair of platinum chopsticks[sic]" on another she said, "Big black girls, if you’re reading this... you’re a cover star."</p>
