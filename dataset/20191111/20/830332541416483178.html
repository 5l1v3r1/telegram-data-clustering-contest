      <p>(CNN) - As a 10-year-old boy, Max Vredenburgh threw a message in a bottle into the Atlantic Ocean in 2010. His message included his home address, in the hopes his message would be found.</p>
      <p>He had to wait nine years, but he finally heard back.</p>
      <p>The now 19-year-old college student from Massachusetts says he completely forgot about sending the message in a bottle until his dad sent a photo of the letter -- and the reply -- in a group text.</p>
      <p>"My parents always saved things from our childhood, so I didn't think much about it," he told CNN on Monday. "Then I read the letter from the recipient, and my heart just dropped."</p>
      <p>Vredenburgh wrote the original letter August 21, 2010. He and his father threw the bottle into the ocean at Long Beach in Rockport, Massachusetts.</p>
      <p>He wanted whoever received his message to know a little bit about himself.</p>
      <p>"I like apples," the letter says. "I like the beach, my favorite color's blue, I like animals, I like cars, and I like outer space."</p>
      <p>It was pretty standard kid stuff, but he was smart enough to leave his address and a plea to please write back.</p>
      <p>The bottle had washed up on a beach in France, between Contis and Mimizan. "G. Dubois" wrote back after it was found on October 10.</p>
      <p>"It will have taken 9 years to cover the 6000 kms that separates us," the letter says. "You had grown a lot during that time: 10 to 19 years old."</p>
      <p>Vredenburgh was shocked. He couldn't believe someone was kind enough to give him a response back. He plans to get in touch with the letter writer and thank him for responding.</p>
      <p>"Something like this just will not happen for the rest of my life," he said.</p>
