      <h1>Apple pulls app that let you stalk people you follow on Instagram</h1>
      <h2>The potentially creepy app was called Like Patrol</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:09:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>In October, Instagram <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903080/instagram-following-activity-tab-disappearing">phased out the “Following” tab</a>. That’s because it shared a lot of information about what your friends and the people you follow were doing on the social network — maybe too much — and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/instagrams-following-activity-tab-is-going-away">Instagram said</a> some people were surprised their activity was showing up there. And now, the company is apparently keeping others from re-creating that idea: Apple has removed Like Patrol from the App Store, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-removes-instagram-stalking-app-from-app-store/">according to <i>CNET</i></a>.</p>
      <p>At the end of October, Instagram <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/instagram-is-shutting-down-a-creepy-app-that-lets-you-stalk-loved-ones/">sent a cease-and-desist letter</a> to Like Patrol, an app described by its maker as the Following tab “on steroids,” and on Saturday, Apple reportedly removed it from its iOS marketplace entirely.</p>

      <p>Like Patrol went beyond the Following tab in some potentially creepy ways, with a number of features that could let users stalk someone’s behavior on Instagram without them knowing. <i>CNET</i> reports that the app could notify you if someone you followed interacted with a post from a man or a woman, for example, and the app’s makers apparently claimed to “have an algorithm to detect if they were posts from attractive people.”</p>
      <p><i>CNET </i>reports Like Patrol was able to track Instagram users by scraping their public profiles for data — which violates Instagram’s policies, according to a Facebook spokesperson who spoke with <i>CNET</i> in October. Apple told <i>CNET </i>it removed Like Patrol for violating the company’s guidelines, but didn’t explain further.</p>
