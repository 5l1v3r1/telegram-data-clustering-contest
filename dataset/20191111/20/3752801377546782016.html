      <h1>Police slam Senzo Meyiwa 'cover-up' report, claim lead investigator is still on the case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:08:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">Kamva Somdyala</a></address>
      <p>The office of the national police commissioner, General Kehla Sitole, has slammed a Sunday Independent report on an alleged "cover-up" in the Senzo Meyiwa murder investigation as containing "myriad assumptions, untruths and innuendos".</p>
      <p>Sitole's spokesperson, Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo, said the report had "the potential of causing unnecessary uncertainties".</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/sundayindependent/inside-senzo-meyiwa-murder-cover-up-36968419">report</a> contains all manner of accusations which include that the lead investigator in the case, Colonel Bongani Gininda, withheld a crucial statement he received in 2017 on who murdered Meyiwa.</p>
      <p>He was gunned down at Kelly Khumalo's mother's home in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, in 2014.</p>
      <p>Khumalo and Meyiwa were dating at the time. </p>
      <p>Initially, it was claimed that at least two men - one of them armed – had stormed the house intending to rob its occupants. In the chaos, Meyiwa and one of the men were entangled in a struggle before the goalkeeper was shot.</p>
      <p>"For starters, Colonel Gininda is heading a team that is re-looking cold cases in the SA Police cold case intervention programme," Naidoo said in a statement on Monday.</p>
      <p>"Gininda is still the lead investigator of the team that is investigating the murder. He was never removed or replaced."</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>This as Police Minister Bheki Cele assured all and sundry the police were all over the investigation - having fanned off allegations that the <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/where-is-the-senzo-meyiwa-murder-docket-dont-ask-police-minister-cele-20191107">docket</a> had gone missing and now with the added pressure of AfriForum pursuing its own investigation into the murder. </p>
      <p>Naidoo added Sitole was being kept abreast of the investigation "and is satisfied with the work that has been done so far".</p>
      <p>A City Press report last week <a href="https://city-press.news24.com/News/senzo-meyiwa-murder-they-all-lied-in-their-statements-20191103">revealed</a> that an audio recording existed in which a senior executive in the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) told a member of Meyiwa's family that the police would again question those who were in the house at the time of his murder.</p>
      <p>"As the NPA, we suspect the shooting happened among the people who were inside the house. We need experienced police officers to go back and re-interview everyone who was in the house on the day Senzo was gunned down. We are not happy with their statements," the publication quoted the executive.</p>
