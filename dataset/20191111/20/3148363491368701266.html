      <h1>Brzezinski: Michael Bloomberg Should Buy Fox News Instead of Run for President | Breitbart</h1>

      <p>Monday, MSNBC “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski suggested former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg should buy Fox News rather than enter the 2020 presidential race.</p>
      <p>Brzezinski pointed to polling showing Bloomberg being “fairly similar” to some of the other candidates already in the race, suggesting Bloomberg has the money to buy Fox News.</p>
      <p>“I’m seeing a lot of people saying, ‘Please buy Fox News’ on Twitter to [Michael Bloomberg] — You know, ‘Please make that your first campaign move.’ He does have the money,” Brzezinski proposed.</p>
      <p>Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire, a frequent “Morning Joe” commentator, added, “[Bloomberg] could buy Fox News several times over, I think. There has certainly been some of that from the Democratic field, suggesting that if Bloomberg wanted to make a positive impact on this race he should use his money in a different fashion.”</p>
