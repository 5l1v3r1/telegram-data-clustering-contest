      <p>Dodson <a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article237237414.html">paid</a> just one dollar for the Cash 5 ticket he purchased at Sons of Nie, an Asian market in Greensboro. “I about fell over,” he <a href="https://nclottery.com/NewsBlogDetails/2019/11/11/--I-about-fell-over-Greensboro-army-veteran-said-of-winning-276688-Cash-5-jackpot">said</a> in a statement released by the lottery, the proceeds of which benefit North Carolina education. Cash 5 pulls a winner every night, with jackpots <a href="https://nclottery.com/Cash5How">starting</a> at $100,000.</p>
      <p>He already seems to know exactly where it is going: The $195,757 Dodson will bring home after taxes will pay off his house and car, with some left over. “I’m tickled to death that I can be debt free,” he said. Dodson has plans for the remainder, as well. “I’m also going to get a bigger TV so I can watch my favorite wrestling matches,” he added.</p>
