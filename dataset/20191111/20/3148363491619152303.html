      <h2>Google has secretly accessed the personal health records of tens of millions of individuals in 21 states, according to a new report from the Wall Street Journal.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:07:34+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">David Ng</a></address>
      <p>The tech giant has partnered with St. Louis-based Ascension, the country’s second-largest health system, in an initiative called Project Nightingale to gain access to lab results, doctor diagnoses, and hospitalization records, as well as other categories.</p>
      <p>Google is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?shareToken=st98ed7303aedb45d281bc0bda02eb90b4">reportedly</a> using the data in part to design new software that helps suggest different avenues of care for individual patients.</p>
      <p>Neither patients nor doctors have been notified about Google’s activity, according to the <i>Journal</i>. An anonymous source said that at least 150 Google employees already have gained access to “much of the data on tens of millions of patients.”</p>
      <p>Privacy experts told the <i>Journal</i> that Google’s actions appear to be legal under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).</p>
      <p>HIPAA rules allow hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used “only to help the covered entity carry out its health-care functions,” according to the <i>Journal</i>.</p>
      <p>A Google spokeswoman told the newspaper that the project is fully compliant with federal health law and includes “robust protections” for patient data.</p>
      <p>The <i>Journal</i> noted that some Ascension employees have raised questions about the way the data is being collected and shared, according to documents.</p>
      <p>Google has come under fire over its privacy practices that critics say often leaves users’ personal information exposed.</p>
      <p>The search engine <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/08/30/google-pay-up-200-million-child-privacy-violations/">was recently ordered</a> to pay between $150 and $200 million to resolve a Federal Trade Commission investigation into YouTube regarding its potential violation of a children’s privacy law.</p>
      <p>Google <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2019/09/23/google-changes-voice-data-rules-following-privacy-scandal/">has also pledged</a> to do more to protect the privacy of users of its voice-activated Google Assistant devices after reports said that company contractors listened in on parts of private conversations.</p>
