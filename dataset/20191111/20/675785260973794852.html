      <h1>Man City 'will not stop' Mikel Arteta from becoming Arsenal manager if Unai Emery leaves</h1>
      <h2>Arteta still holds affection for Arsenal from his time playing at the club and is one of the main contenders to take over should under-fire Emery depart</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:19:01+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Man City</a> will reportedly allow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mikel-arteta">Mikel Arteta</a> to leave the club if Arsenal make an approach for him to be their manager.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners midfielder has been working as assistant to City boss Pep Guardiola since retiring from playing at the end of his time with Arsenal.</p>
      <p>He has been linked with the managerial role at the Emirates in the past, but missed out to Unai Emery when he was appointed last summer.</p>
      <p>Emery is now under pressure though following a dismal run of form, with Arteta among the favourites to replace him should he be sacked from his post.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10324973/arsenal-man-city-mikel-arteta-unai-emery/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1573495469">The Sun report</a> that City would not stand in Arteta's way should <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> come calling, with the Spaniard keen to make the step up from assistant in the future.</p>

      <p>An Etihad source told the Sun: "Mikel loves working at City and learning from the best manager in the world in Pep.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows he wants to be his own man one day, though.</p>
      <p>"Mikel still has a lot of affection for Arsenal from his playing days there."</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was previously captain of Arsenal during his five-year spell there from 2011-2016.</p>

      <p>He has now been installed as fourth-favourite with bookmakers to take over from Emery should he depart, behind Jose Mourinho, Luis Enrique and Fredrik Ljungberg.</p>
      <p>Arsenal released a statement on Monday addressing Emery's situation at the club.</p>
      <p>The club’s head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham met staff at a pre-planned get together for 200 staff and underlined their support of the manager, but with a subtle warning.</p>
      <p>They said “We are as disappointed as everyone else with both our results and performances at this stage of the season. We share the frustration with our fans, Unai, players and all our staff as they are not at the level we want or expect.</p>
      <p>“Things need to improve to meet our objectives for the season, and we firmly believe Unai is the right man for the job, together with the backroom team we have in place. We are all working intensively behind the scenes to turn things around and are confident we will.</p>
      <p>“We never take our fantastic support for granted. We hope we can all stick together and get behind the team in this challenging period, as together we are stronger.”</p>
