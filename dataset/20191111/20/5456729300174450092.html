      <h1>60% of imported drugs to be manufactured locally - NAFDAC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:43:52+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/362276-60-of-imported-drugs-to-be-manufactured-locally-nafdac.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) said it would ensure that 60 per cent of the drugs being imported into the country were manufactured locally.</p>
      <p>Mojisola Adeyeye, the Director-General of the agency, said this at a news conference, on Monday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>She stressed the need for the agency to ensure the local pharmaceutical manufacturing sector thrived.</p>
      <p>She said a significant amount of substandard and falsified drugs were creeping into the country.</p>
      <p>“We want the local manufacturing sector to thrive; we want a situation whereby 60 per cent of the country’s products are manufactured locally,” Mrs Adeyeye said.</p>
      <p>She said that a significant amount of substandard and falsified medicines were being imported “as unregistered or registered but with compromise on the content after approval to become substandard.”</p>
      <p>“One of the drives of my administration is to encourage local manufacturing for products that can be manufactured in Nigeria,” the NAFDAC boss said.</p>
      <p>She stated that the agency now encouraged innovation from local manufacturers by giving five-year market exclusivity to the innovator- company with the capacity to meet the country’s demand.</p>
      <p>Mrs Adeyeye added that during the period, “there would be no approval of a similar product to ensure that products manufactured, imported, distributed and sold after registration or renewal of registration conformed with quality specifications”.</p>
      <p>She said that the agency had four laboratories, with ISO-17025 accreditation across the country, to test the quality of medicines, vaccines test kits and other biological products.</p>
      <p>Mrs Adeyeye said NAFDAC had overhauled its testing of products coming from China and India by re-certification of the ‘clean report’ and ‘analysis agents’ as well as laboratories from those countries.</p>
      <p>This, she said, was aimed at ensuring that the imported products were tested by qualified laboratories.</p>
      <p>The official said part of the restrictions was streamlining the pre-shipment testing, with testing done post-shipment. (NAN)</p>
