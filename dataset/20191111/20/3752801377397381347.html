      <p>Egyptian authorities on Monday opened up Tora prison in Cairo for a media tour, following a UN report on the "brutal" conditions in which jailed ex-president Mohammed Morsi was held before his death.</p>
      <p>In a rare tour of the sprawling jail complex, journalists were shown an exhibition of furniture made by inmates, a farm with cows and ostriches, and a brief football match between prisoners.</p>
      <p>The guided tour comes ahead of a mission to Geneva by Egyptian officials for a review on Wednesday before the United Nations Human Rights Council.</p>
      <p>It was arranged in response to a stinging review last week by an independent panel of UN experts that blasted conditions in Tora.</p>
      <p>The experts said the death of ousted Islamist president Morsi, who was held in Tora for five years, could amount to a "state-sanctioned arbitrary killing".</p>
      <p>The former president died in June after collapsing in a Cairo courtroom while on trial.</p>
      <p>"Morsi was held in conditions that can only be described as brutal, particularly during his five-year detention in the Tora prison complex," the experts said in a statement.</p>
      <p>His death "after enduring those conditions could amount to a state-sanctioned arbitrary killing", the experts added. They also warned that thousands are at risk of death in the same prison.</p>
      <p>On the media tour, abuse charges in Tora were dismissed by politicians and personalities that included for example retired ex-national football goalkeeper turned television pundit Ahmed Shobeir.</p>
      <p>"This prison is more of a seaside resort now compared to what it used to be," Mostafa Bakry, a pro-Sisi parliamentarian, contended.</p>
      <p>He told AFP that inmates were treated with dignity, pointing to a newly-mowed football pitch.</p>
      <p>On documented allegations of abuse, Bakry said these were foreign-originated charges designed to sow chaos, echoing the common response of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.</p>
      <p>The former head of the army turned president led the military's ouster of Morsi in 2013.</p>
      <p>"Inmates are not sitting in their cells. They can play soccer or exercise and there are a lot of activities for them," said Alaa Abed, a former policeman and current head of parliament's human rights committee.</p>
      <p>Other senior officials declined to speak on the record during the tour, while AFP was prevented from talking directly with inmates.</p>
      <p>The family of prominent human rights lawyer Mohamed el-Baqer, who was detained in September, said on social media they were prevented from seeing him Monday because of the media tour.</p>
      <p>Rights groups have regularly accused Egyptian authorities of severe violations including torture, overcrowding and medical negligence in jails.</p>
      <p>At least 4 000 people, including lawyers, activists, professors and journalists, were detained in a wave of arrests following rare anti-Sisi protests in September, according to local rights groups.</p>
