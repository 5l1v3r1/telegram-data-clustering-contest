      <h1>Kim Kardashian Adds Boob Tape and Nipple Covers to Skims Solutionwear</h1>
      <h2>The expansion is another sign of the company's rapid growth.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/market-reacts-to-kim-kardashian-shapewear-line-1203205334/">Kim Kardashian is lifting up</a> and covering up the ladies. </p>
      <p>Skims Solutionwear, the reality television star and entrepreneur’s shapewear line, is expanding yet again. This time with boob tape and nipple pasties. </p>
      <p>“This material is super soft and super stretchy. But not too stretchy, because you want it to hold,” Kardashian said on <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> Monday, showing off the products. </p>
      <p>“It doesn’t really rip off your skin like the Gaffers tape used to do,” Kardashian said. (The starlet has notoriously used the heavy-duty electrical tape — the kind used by production crews to prevent heavy equipment from moving — to hold up her bust while wearing plunging necklines and other revealing tops.) “That would give me literal scabs and burns for the longest time,” she added. </p>
      <p>Kardashian <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/kim-kardashian-wests-skims-solutionwear-launch-sept-10-1203266091/">launched Skims Solutionwear, </a><a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/kim-kardashian-wests-skims-solutionwear-launch-sept-10-1203266091/">the star’s attempt to create an inclusive shapewear collection</a><a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/kim-kardashian-wests-skims-solutionwear-launch-sept-10-1203266091/">, on Sept. 10.</a> The line was rumored to sell out within minutes, pulling in an estimated $2 million in sales. Representatives for Skims would not confirm or deny this, but Skims’ <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-yeezy-new-york-fast-company-innovation-festival-1203365773/">Instagram</a> page has been flooded with comments from would-be shoppers ever since, asking when they will be able to buy the products.</p>
      <p>In October, Kardashian <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/kim-kardashian-west-skims-solutionwear-cotton-collection-1203341693/">added the Cotton Collection</a>, an assortment of loungewear and intimates apparel. </p>
      <p>In an Instagram story on Monday, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/kim-kardashian-skims-cotton-collection-debuts-1203344515/">she said she’s been working on the body tape</a> “for a really long time and I’ve never seen it in different shades before.”</p>

      <p>She added that the nipple covers are just the right amount of stretch and coverage. </p>
      <p>“This material is amazing,” Kardashian said. “Because once you put this on your nipple — there’s a little padding here — you cannot see this through anything. This little tier drop gives this mini boob lift effect without going as hardcore as the tape might be.”</p>

      <p>Skims’ body accessories will be available in three colors on Skims.com starting Nov. 14 at 9 a.m. PST. Both the body tape and pasties are waterproof and sweatproof and last for 12 hours, according to Skims. Pasties are $12 for five pairs, while the body tape is $36 a roll.</p>
