      <p>Google has taken to its Keyword blog to reveal no fewer than 12 titles in the Stadia lineup expected to launch alongside the service's start date. For clarity, that's November 19. The search giant also <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/stadia/lineup-games-coming-to-stadia/">outlined</a> at least 14 more it also already plans for the remainder of the year.</p>
      <p>The list includes at least a dozen heavy-hitters, some of which were already known and at least a few are expected to come to Stadia before other platforms. Near the top of what's expected to be available from day-one are titles like Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The older Ubisoft title was part of a playable test demo of the service early on. That will join the pre-order bonus title Destiny 2: The Collection as part of the launch lineup for Google Stadia.</p>
      <p>The company also says that Tequila Work's dark, narrative exploration title Gylt will be available from the beginning. Red Dead Redemption 2, Mortal Kombat 11, and a swath of Tomb Raider titles will be present and accounted for. That includes Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition.</p>

      <p>Toward the indie side of the spectrum, games like Kine, Samauri Showdown, and Thumper will be playable from the beginning too. Those looking for a more laid-back experience will also find Just Dance 2020 in the Google Stadia launch lineup.</p>
      <h3>What Google Stadia games are already in the lineup for the rest of 2019?</h3>
      <p>Google isn't pulling any punches when it comes to titles still-to-come for 2019 either. While it also hasn't outlined any specific dates for the remaining titles, things will arguably only get better as the year progresses. Among the most prominent of those titles, Google lists the third entry in 2K's long-running Borderlands franchise. That's joined by other big games such as FINAL FANTASY XV, Rage 2, and Metro Exodus.</p>
      <p>Of course, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/amazon-ember-coffee-mug-smart-deal">Darksiders Genesis</a> will be arriving before 2019 is out as well. That title is one of the first that is expected to land on Stadia before any other console or platform.</p>

      <p>Those who favor shooters won't be left out of the fray either. Ghost Recon Breakpoint will be joined by the likes of Wolfenstein: Youngblood before the year's end. The action continues in DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE 2 and Attack on Titan 2: Final Battle. Both latter titles are expected to land before the new year.</p>
      <p>On the sports side of the expected 2019 games, Google plans to release Football Manager 2020, Trials Rising, NBA 2K20, and GRID.</p>
      <p>Finally, rounding out Stadia's launch lineup, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/google-news">Google</a> says that Farming Simulator 19 will arrive before 2020. The brand new farm management game should serve well for those who want something a bit less intense.</p>

      <h3>No word on the first-party titles</h3>
      <p>The list of launch titles for Stadia revealed by Google is hardly all-encompassing. But it does cover a wide band of the gaming spectrum. The company also pointed out that it still plans to launch other big names in the industry sooner than later too. Specifically, it says it plans to launch Doom: Eternal, WatchDogs: Legion, Gods &amp; Monsters and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
      <p>There is one area where the company is understandably playing things close to its chest. Namely, the search giant hasn't provided any details about the first-party <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/stadia-games-studios-japan-uk.html">game studios</a> it plans to open up in Japan and the UK.</p>
      <p>More detailed plans for those were only uncovered near the beginning of this month and the decision to open a studio was announced in late October. It may seem odd that Google wouldn't take the opportunity to provide some details about the studio itself. But games do take years to make. So it won't likely make any announcements on that front until late 2020 at the earliest.</p>
