      <h1>Coin toss could again settle Ohio mayor's race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:05:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:05</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p>A coin toss could be used to decide the winner of an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/ohio">Ohio</a> mayoral contest after each candidate received the same number of votes during last week's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections">election</a>.</p>
      <p>Travis Boyd and Grant Downes each garnered 127 votes in the tiny village of Magnolia, a town some 73 miles south of Cleveland, <a href="https://www.cantonrep.com/news/20191108/tied-mayors-race-in-magnolia-is-deja-vu">The Canton Repository</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The town, straddling Stark and Carroll Counties, has a history of using chance to select its public officials.</p>

      <p>Departing Mayor Robert Leach won his 1979 race by a coin toss. He chose not to run for reelection this year after running unopposed for nine consecutive elections.</p>
      <p>“You couldn’t have scripted it any better,” Boyd said.</p>
      <p>“That’s just the way we get new mayors here,” Downes said.</p>
      <p>Leach said the scenario is "familiar," adding that “Magnolia just can’t make up its mind.... What comes around goes around, I guess.”</p>

      <p>The coin toss will be used to determine the winner if Boyd and Downes remain tied after the election results are certified later this month.</p>
      <p>A 1923 Peace silver dollar is believed to have been used to break election ties in Stark County since the early 1940s.</p>
