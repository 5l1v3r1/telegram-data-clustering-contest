      <h1>Disney+ gets last-minute update, will have most Marvel movies at launch</h1>
      <h2>Other titles will remain on Netflix through the end of the year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:35:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Disney has apparently worked out multiple deals to get much of the MCU back at launch.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1193985534927892480?s=20">new Twitter thread from the official Disney+ account</a> lists a number of new Marvel titles that will be available to stream at launch. It explains why there are now several more Marvel titles available on Disney+ than what the company announced less than one month ago. On October 14th, Disney announced that <i>Iron Man</i>,<i> Iron Man 3</i>,<i> Thor: The Dark World</i>,<i> </i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"><i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i></a>,<i> </i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/8/8910557/ant-man-movie-review-marvel-paul-rudd"><i>Ant-Man</i></a>,<i> </i>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251874/captain-marvel-review-marvel-mcu-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson"><i>Captain Marvel</i></a><i> </i>would be available on Disney+ in the US at launch.</p>
      <p>Then, last week, Disney announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951682/avengers-endgame-disney-plus-launch-title-marvel-movies-star-wars"><i>Avengers: Endgame </i>would be available on Disney+ one month earlier than expected</a>, moving up from December 11th to November 12th. Now, the thread confirms that <i>Iron Man 2</i>,<i> Thor</i>,<i> Captain America: The First Avenger</i>,<i> Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>,<i> The Avengers</i>,<i> Guardians of the Galaxy</i>,<i> Captain America: Civil War</i>,<i> Doctor Strange</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 </i>are also available to stream on Disney+ at launch. The only films that aren’t on the service are those that will remain on Netflix until the end of 2019 (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/6/16977756/black-panther-movie-review-ryan-coogler-marvel-cinematic-universe-chadwick-boseman-michael-b-jordan"><i>Black Panther</i></a>,<i> Ant-Man and the Wasp</i>,<i> </i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17276030/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel-iron-man"><i>Avengers: Infinity War</i></a>,<i> </i>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16501108/thor-ragnarok-movie-review-marvel-chris-hemsworth-taika-waititi"><i>Thor: Ragnarok</i></a>). These four movies will become available on Disney+ beginning in 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/11/16131564/netflix-disney-marvel-star-wars-streaming-2019">once the contract with Netflix expires</a>.</p>
      <p>Rights issues are complicated. It’s why seven installments in the Skywalker saga will be available to stream on Disney+, but not <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/22/16787554/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rey-snoke-parents-questions-mysteries-rian-johnson-jj-abrams"><i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i></a>. Like <i>Black Panther </i>and <i>Infinity War</i>, it’s tied up in a deal with Netflix. <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </i>is only on Disney+ at launch because Disney entered a deal with Starz. Disney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20941540/disney-plus-starz-ads-star-wars-force-awakens-espn-streaming-wars-licensing">confirmed to <i>The Verge </i>that it will run a one-time promotional ad</a> offering for Starz that will appear during the sign-up process for Disney+ in return for <i>The Force Awakens</i>. It also explains why <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>, which debuted in 2008 after <i>Iron Man</i>, won’t be on Disney+; it’s still owned by Paramount.</p>
      <p>But who knows — never say never. Maybe <i>The Incredible Hulk </i>will be there one day, too.</p>
