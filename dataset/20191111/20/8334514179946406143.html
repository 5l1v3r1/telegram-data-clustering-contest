      <p>(Reuters) - Two horses have been euthanized after suffering injuries on Sunday in races 90 minutes apart at Del Mar racetrack in southern California, officials said.</p>

      <p>Both horses were later euthanized, track officials said.</p>
      <p>Four other horses died in training accidents during the trackâ€™s summer racing season, which ended on Sept. 2, NBCSandiego.com reported.</p>
