      <p>TORONTO -- Longtime NHL broadcaster Don Cherry has been fired after decades on Canadian airwaves over offensive comments he made about immigrants.</p>
      <p>The “Coach’s Corner” host came under fire over the weekend for comments claiming that immigrants don’t wear poppies and don’t support veterans.</p>
      <p>"You people … that come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that," Cherry said during a broadcast on Sportsnet Saturday night. "These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price."</p>
      <p>Sportsnet network president Bart Yabsley called Cherry’s comments “discriminatory” on Sunday and announced Monday that he would be no longer be on air.  </p>
      <p>“Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night’s broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down,” Yabsley said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“During the broadcast, he made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for.”</p>
      <p>Yabsley also thanked the 85-year-old Cherry for “his contributions to hockey and sports broadcasting in Canada.”</p>
      <p>Cherry specifically mentioned not seeing people wearing poppies in downtown Toronto and in his home city of Mississauga, Ont. He contrasted this to an abundance of poppies in smaller towns.</p>
      <p>More than half of all people in Toronto and Mississauga identify as a visible minority, according to census data, while smaller towns in Ontario are predominantly white.</p>
      <p>Cherry’s co-host Ron MacLean apologized Sunday for not responding live to Cherry’s comments, which he called “flat out wrong” in a statement.</p>
      <p>Cherry himself has not issued any public comment on the matter. He was reached by the Toronto Sun, <a href="https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-don-cherry-fired-over-controversial-poppy-comment">which reported</a> that he said his words were patriotic, not racist, and that “everybody in Canada should wear a poppy.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>OUTRAGE FAR AND WIDE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cherry’s comments were swiftly panned online, but also received some support, with the hashtag “Don Cherry Is Right” trending on Twitter in the country.</p>
      <p>“Coach’s Corner” has been a fixture for more than 30 years during intermissions on “Hockey Night in Canada” broadcasts. CBC produced the show until 2014, when it was taken over by Sportsnet.</p>
      <p>CBC, which still airs the show but does not earn any revenue from it, issued a statement Monday saying the public broadcaster “respect[s] Sportsnet’s decision that this is the right time for Don to step down.”</p>
      <p>Cherry has <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/don-cherry-s-history-of-controversial-comments-1.4680505">periodically attracted controversy</a> for making comments deriding Europeans, French-Canadians and people who ride bicycles. In 2003, his segment was placed on a seven-second delay after he criticized Canada’s decision not to join the Iraq War.</p>
      <p>For many, though, Saturday’s comments seemed to be a bridge too far. The Canada Broadcast Standards Council <a href="https://www.cbsc.ca/make-a-complaint/">issued a plea</a> to people to stop reporting Cherry’s comments to them, saying it had already received more complaints than it was able to process.</p>
      <p>Parminder Singh, the original play-by-play announcer on the Punjabi-language edition of Hockey Night in Canada, said he considered Cherry an idol as he was growing up and once he entered the business.</p>
      <p>He said he wants Canadians to understand that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences, and that he wished Cherry had said something less divisive.</p>
      <p>“It’s important for us to recognize that … what we’re honouring, the veterans – they come from all different backgrounds and cultures,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It should have been done in more of an embraceful manner.”</p>
      <p>Hockey journalist Bruce Dowbiggin said that he was less surprised by Cherry’s firing than by his making it this long without losing his job.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of people would have expected him to have done this already – to have said the wrong thing and gotten offside,” he told CTV News Channel.</p>
      <p>Several organizations that have traditionally supported Cherry issued statements Monday asserting agreement with his firing.</p>
      <p>“While we recognize Don Cherry’s four decades of service broadcasting NHL games, today’s decision was a justifiable response to his comments on Saturday night,” said the National Hockey League.</p>
      <p>The Royal Canadian Legion said that it appreciates Cherry’s “passionate support for veterans” but found his remarks “hurtful,” while Budweiser – the parent company of “Coach’s Corner” sponsor Labatt – called them “clearly inappropriate.”</p>
