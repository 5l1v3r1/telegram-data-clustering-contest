      <p>Home to nearly 300 species of birds, many of which come to Oman during their biannual migratory flights across the world, the Al Ansab Wetland is a nature lover’s paradise that few have heard of so far, but many will soon know of, given the area's fast-growing popularity. Sea-wading birds such as the Black Winged Stilt are full-time residents at the wetland, while many species of eagles come to Muscat during the winter months, where they fly into the Sultanate in November and leave once the cold season is over.<br/><br/>"Set in the middle of Muscat, Al Ansab Wetland is a protected area and an ornithologist’s dream," said the Ministry of Tourism. "Over 293 species of birds stop over at different times throughout the year, with over 80 resident species."</p>

      <p>"Colours and fragrance fill the air at Al Ansab Wetland where winter sees the best of plants and trees bloom. The wetland has 113 species of Omani trees and shrubs," added the organisation. <br/><br/>“The wetland has been there since mid- to late 80s but it was not the way it is now. Since 2011, we started focusing more on it and made a lot of changes. It is now all treated water and therefore you do not have any smell in the wetland areas,” said Hussain Hassan Abdul Hussain, CEO of Haya Water. “With the addition of shrubs and trees, we are attracting more birds. Initially, 150 bird species were reported. Now, it is more than 300.”</p>

      <p>The Ministry of Tourism said that the wetland had five lagoons, the biggest of which had a depth of four metres. "The water, besides attracting birds, also supports greenery. Most of the trees and shrubs are naturally grown. The Haya Water team planted 300 trees to create a forest area, which have all grown and today provide extended shade. In the process, there have been other trees that have sprouted naturally such as banyan trees and date palms. A little further away, adjacent to the nursery of the wetland, the team planted more trees."</p>

      <p>The wetland is open from 6:30am to 2pm from Sunday to Thursday. The best time to visit the site is early in the morning, between 6.30 and 9.00 a.m. Visitors should also wear comfortable shoes and carry drinking water with them.<br/><br/>A booking form is available online, at <a href="https://haya.om/en/Pages/Wetland.aspx">https://haya.om/en/Pages/Wetland.aspx</a>, where a feedback form to provide recommendations and suggestions from those who have already visited the Ansab Wetlands is also available.</p>
