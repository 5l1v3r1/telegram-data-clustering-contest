      <p>Microsoft has finally fixed a bug that caused the Windows 10 1903 settings to disappear that allowed you to defer Windows updates to a later date. This was quietly fixed in the optional KB4522355 cumulative update and will hopefully make it into tomorrow's Patch Tuesday updates.</p>
      <p>Windows 10 1903 has an advanced Windows update option that allows you to defer a new feature update for 365 days or a quality update for 30 days.</p>

      <p>An unacknowledged bug, would cause these settings to disappear on reboot if you change either of them to a non-zero value.  Even though the settings would be gone, Windows 10 would still honor the values you previously selected, but no longer provider you an easy way to change them.</p>

      <p>When users encountered this bug, the only way they could change the settings would be to do it from the Windows Registry "DeferFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays" and "DeferQualityUpdatesPeriodInDays" values under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings key.</p>

      <p>Woody Leanhord, who has been <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3452525/disappearing-windows-update-deferral-pane-suddenly-reappears.html">tracking this bug</a> for quite some time, recently learned that this issue is fixed in the latest Windows 10 1903 KB4522355 cumulative update released on October 24th, 2019.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/142625-strange-case-missing-pause-feature-update-setting.html#post1754080">TenForums user Bree</a> and confirmed by BleepingComputer, installing the KB4522355 update will fix the issue and the settings will become visible again.</p>

      <p>As the KB4522355 update is optional, it is expected (hoped?) that this fix will make it into all Windows 10 machines tomorrow on the November 12th Patch Tuesday.</p>
