      <h2>Spider-Man Far From Home is out on Blu-ray now - but do the special features provide all that a fan desires</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:39:55+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The latest Spidey outing was very popular with MCU fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/spider-man-far-from-home">Spider-Man Far From Home</a> continued the story of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tom-holland">Tom Holland</a> as Spider-Man/Peter Parker and saw him join MJ (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/zendaya">Zendaya</a>) and his friends go on a trip around Europe but face disaster from the inter-dimensional threat of The Elementals.</p>
      <p>However, the threat seemed to face being extinguished by the actions of Mysterio/Quentin Beck (<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jake-gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>).</p>
      <p>But this new hero wasn't all he seemed.</p>
      <p>The reviews were glowing for the film, but does the new Blu-ray release provide anything extra to the experience for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/spiderman">Spider-Man</a> fans?</p>
      <p>Here's what you need to know about the special features.</p>

      <p>If you are a fan of Spider-Man, particularly Tom Holland's iteration of Peter Parker then this will be a must-have.</p>
      <p>“Peter’s To-Do List” is a particularly fun little episode of Parker’s everyday double-life as Spider-Man, as Peter goes about errands for his upcoming trip, but we are then also treated to a colourful action scene previously only glimpsed in trailers. Seeing Spidey interact with the police is also a fun change-up and explores the cockier side of the character.</p>
      <p>Of the many featurettes on the disc, we also get the informative and intriguing discussions in “Stepping Up” which see Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige, Tom Holland, and other architects of this version of Spider-Man discuss his place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe going into Far From Home and where the character will go next. This future that is teased by Holland and co also feels more gratifying now that we know his place in the MCU is assured.</p>
      <p>Some of the other clips are exactly what they say on the tin, but it is exciting for fans of characters such as Aunt May Parker and Mysterio aka Quentin Beck get attention from producers and actors as they discuss their transition from comics to the film.</p>

      <p>Sadly, the features are let down by rather forgettable deleted scenes which expand on some of the comedy elements but provide no extra insight into plot or character.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, the biggest treat will be the hilarious Outtakes and Gag reel which especially utilises the fantastic chemistry Tom Holland and Jake Gyllenhaal.</p>
      <p>Overall, the Spider-Man Far From Home will be worth purchasing for fans of MCU Spidey as they will get the latest chapter of his story alongside a whole host of features that will add to understanding the web-slinger's adventure and its characters.</p>
