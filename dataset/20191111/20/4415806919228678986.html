      <p>A Tesco advert in the UK that used an image of Mel B has been taken down after the Spice Girl complained.</p>
      <p>The image of the singer, also known as Scary Spice, was used in an advert for the supermarket’s new Clubcard Plus.</p>
      <p>Alongside an image of Mel in a leopard print catsuit, taken at the Brit Awards in 1997, the advert reads: “Stop right now. You get 10% off two big shops a month for £7.99.”</p>
      <p>The advert is a play on words from the group’s hit single Stop, which contains the lyrics: “Stop right now”.</p>
      <p>The singer posted an image of a bus stop advert on Instagram and wrote: “Can the CEO OF TESCO DAVE LEWIS PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY. Thank you.”</p>

      <p>Tesco said it has now removed the image from its campaign.</p>
      <p>A Tesco spokesman said: “Here at Tesco we are really big fans of Mel B and were excited to feature her photo in our campaign.</p>
      <p>“We had authorisation to use this image, but we’re sorry Mel B is unhappy so we’ve stopped using it.”</p>
      <p>The advert was part of Tesco’s latest campaign that features British cultural references from the past 100 years for its 100th anniversary, with the tagline: “Prices that take you back”.</p>
      <p>Other celebrities, including comedy duo Morecambe and Wise, have also been used in the campaign.</p>
