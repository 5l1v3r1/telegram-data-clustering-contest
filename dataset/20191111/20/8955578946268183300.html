      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 11 – RIA Tomsk.</b> Scientists of <a href="https://tpu.ru/en">Tomsk Polytechnic University</a> (TPU) have assembled a unique generator for a water treatment plant commissioned by the Israeli company WADIS; the development of Tomsk scientists will help to introduce effective technology of wastewater treatment, the press service of the university reported on Monday.</p>
      <p>It is specified that WADIS is engaged in electric discharge disinfection of water. Employees of the Laboratory for Pulse-Beam, Electric Discharge and Plasma Technologies of TPU under the leadership of Professor Gennady Remnev assembled a high-voltage generator of nanosecond duration for the company.</p>
      <blockquote>"Generator is one of the main elements of ozonizer (water treatment device). It is the source of a high voltage nanosecond pulse initiating discharge that produces a large amount of ozone. It is planned that the generator will be used for fine purification of water from organic compounds without the use of reagents in the Israeli project", – the message says.</blockquote>
      <p>It is added that the device has already been delivered to Israel.</p>
      <p>The company commissioned Tomsk scientists to accomplish this task.</p>
      <h4>Constructive decision</h4>

      <p>"Usually, such generators form high-voltage pulses with a frequency of up to one kilohertz with an average power of 0.5-1 kilowatts, and we needed to reach three kilohertz with an average generator power of 4.5 kilowatts, at the same time the generator should operate at a load of 50 ohms", – researcher of the Laboratory for Pulse-Beam, Electric Discharge and Plasma Technologies of TPU Mikhail Zhuravlev is quoted in the message.</p>
      <p>According to him, this was possible due to special design solutions used in the creation of the generator: "It was really a non-trivial task. The developed generator is a unit, created for a specific task. We haven't made generators with so little resistance yet".</p>
      <p>Another requirement that was put before the Tomsk polytechnics is that the generator should be capable of operating 24 hours a day. It also handled this task at trials in Israel.</p>
      <p>Tomsk Polytechnic University – is the leading technical university of the country. It's founded in 1896 as Tomsk Technological Institute of Practical Engineers of Emperor Nicholas II. It became the first engineering university in the Asian part of the country. Today TPU – is the largest technical university beyond the Urals; enters the top 10 universities of Russia and the top 400 universities of the world. Since 2013 participates in the "5-100" program to increase competitiveness in the world.</p>
