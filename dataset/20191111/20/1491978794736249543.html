        <i>More than 2,000 Americans who vape have become sick since March, and at least 40 people have died</i>
      </p>
      <p>Doctors at a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/detroit">Detroit</a> hospital have performed a double lung transplant on a man whose lungs were damaged from vaping.</p>
      <p>No other details of the transplant were released on Monday by Henry Ford <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health">Health</a> System, which scheduled a news conference for Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The patient asked his medical team to share photographs and an update to warn others about vaping.</p>
      <p>More than 2,000 Americans who vape have become sick since March, many of them teenagers and young adults, and at least 40 people have died.</p>
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/08/cdc-vaping-lung-injury-breakthrough-vitamin-e-acetate">last week announced a breakthrough</a> into the cause of a vaping illness outbreak, identifying a chemical compound as a “very strong culprit”.</p>
      <p>Vitamin E acetate previously was found in liquid from electronic cigarettes and other vaping devices used by many who got sick and only recently has been used as a vaping fluid thickener.</p>
      <p>Many who got sick said they had vaped liquids that contain THC, the high-inducing part of marijuana.</p>
