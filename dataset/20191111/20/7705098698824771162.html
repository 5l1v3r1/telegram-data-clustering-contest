      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T20:07:10+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author">Maggie Dela Paz</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://collider.com/jayme-lawson-joins-the-batman/?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter">Collider</a>, recent Julliard graduate Jayme Lawson has successfully landed her first major Hollywood project as she has been tapped for an undisclosed key role in director Matt Reeves’ upcoming DC film <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a>. During her time in Julliard, Lawson has starred in various school productions including leading roles in <b>Hamlet</b> and <b>Romeo and Juliet</b>.</p>
      <p>Lawson will be joining a star-studded cast that will be led by Robert Pattinson (<b>Good Time</b>, <b>The Lighthouse</b>) as the titular Dark Knight. The film will also be featuring Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, and Paul Dano as the Riddler. <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/471115-report-colin-farrell-may-play-penguin-in-the-batman">Colin Farrell</a> and Andy Serkis are reportedly in talks to portray the roles of Penguin and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively. Early speculation about Lawson’s role has put forth the theory that she will play Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Wright’s Commissioner Gordon. However, that’s far from confirmed at the moment.</p>
