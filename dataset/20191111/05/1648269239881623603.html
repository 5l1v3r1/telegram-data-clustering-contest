      <h1>Ford Open To Bringing Back The Capri</h1>
      <h2>Please do so, Ford.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T05:40:17+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 05:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-karr/" target="_blank">Anthony Karr</a></address>
      <p>Ford’s European division has recently resurrected the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/369017/ford-puma-titanium-x-revealed/">Puma moniker</a> that was used for an affordable two-door sports car in the 90s. At our side of the big pond, the Blue Oval will very soon bring back to life another iconic nameplate, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380300/ford-bronco-r-truck-debut/">the Bronco</a>, and it turns out the company will happily revive even more of its legendary names from the past if it has the chance to and if this makes a business case.</p>
      <p>Britain’s <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/ford-capri-could-still-be-revived-says-design-boss"><i>Autocar</i></a> recently had a chat with the head of <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a>’s European design studio, Amko Leenarts, who admitted his team dreams of reviving the Capri name. As a quick reminder, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Capri">Capri</a> was basically the European equivalent of the Mustang for Europe, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/15372/ford-capri-still-looking-good-at-40/">produced between 1968 and 1986</a> and selling more than 1.9 million units. Could this model return on the Old Continent?</p>

      <p>“Who would not want to bring back the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/ford-capri/">Capri</a> as a design?” Leenarts told the British publication. “We’d love it. But it’s got to be in the zeitgeist and has to fit, and work as a plural, not just exist as something for a designer to bring back an old car. I’m amazed by the amount of names we own that spur emotions, positive and negative.”</p>
      <p>But, just like any new vehicle on the market, a resurrected Capri should make a business case before all. Leenarts gave <i>Autocar</i> the Probe as an example – a car that was believed to be the Capri’s spiritual replacement but it didn’t have great success on the market in terms of sales. Was the design to blame?</p>

      <p>“Kinetic design was the right move at the right time,” Leenarts said. “But it’s now pretty old-fashioned to have a name. It’s just to tick a box, rather than design around. We have many different vehicles in the portfolio that no single design language or philosophy could cover.”</p>
