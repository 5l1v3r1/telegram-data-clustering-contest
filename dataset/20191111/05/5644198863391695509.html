      <p>MEXICO CITY: The Mexican government invited the FBI on Sunday (Nov 10) to participate in its investigation into an attack in northern Mexico that killed nine dual citizens of the United States and Mexico.</p>
      <p>Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement it extended the invitation through a diplomatic note to the US Embassy in Mexico.</p>

      <p>"The Mexican government reiterates its commitment to investigate the facts, in order to ... offer justice to the affected families," the ministry said.</p>
      <p>The US agents must work in coordination with their Mexican counterparts and will not be armed, it added.</p>
      <p>The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>On Monday, gunmen killed three women and six children from a breakaway Mormon community in northern Mexico, prompting US President Donald Trump to offer Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador help in wiping out drug gangs he blamed for the ambush.</p>
