      <p>BANGKOK -- Shares declined on world markets on Monday as investors awaited developments in the China-U.S. trade war saga after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington had not agreed to gradually roll back tariffs as negotiations progress.</p>
      <p>Britain's FTSE fell 0.6% to 7,316.49 while the CAC 40 in Paris was flat at 5,889.57. Germany's DAX shed 0.2% to 13,196.21. Wall Street looked set for losses with futures for the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.3%.</p>
      <p>In Asia, Hong Kong led the retreat, with the Hang Seng losing 2.6% to 26,926.55 after a police officer shot and wounded a protester.</p>
      <p>Later, a man was in critical condition after he was set on fire during an argument in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Uncertainty has risen in the city after more than five months of protests that began with a fight over an extradition bill that has expanded to include demands for greater democracy and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, the Shanghai Composite index declined 1.8% to 2,909.97, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.3% to 23,331.84. South Korea's Kospi dropped 0.6% to 2,124.09 while the Sensex in India lost 0.1% to 40,287.29.</p>
      <p>Australia's S&amp;P ASX/200 was the sole major index to advance, gaining 0.7% to 6,772.50. Taiwan's benchmark dropped 1.3% and shares were lower in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Hopes for a breakthrough in the trade standoff between Beijing and Washington were shaken when Trump on Friday dismissed a Chinese official's assertion that the U.S. side had agreed to gradually lift tariffs on Chinese goods that it has imposed in the conflict over trade and technology policies.</p>
      <p>A Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesman had said Thursday that the two sides had agreed to a phased cancellation of their tariff hikes as part of an agreement now under negotiation.</p>
      <p>"They'd like to have a rollback," Trump told reporters at the White House. "I haven't agreed to anything."</p>
      <p>That raised doubts over progress officials had suggested was being made in finalizing a "Phase 1" deal that was announced on Oct. 12.</p>
      <p>A private sector source with knowledge of the talks said there is disagreement within the White House over whether and by how much to roll back 15% duties imposed on Sept. 1 on $112 billion of goods.</p>
      <p>"It will be the U.S.-China trade talks that will continue to dictate the daily swings in sentiment this week," Jeffrey Halley of Oanda said in a commentary.</p>
      <p>"What matters is getting some sort of interim trade deal across the line for both sides. President Trump's comments sounded more like a negotiating tactic than an actual threat, and Wall Street seemed to agree."</p>
      <p>Shares in New York ended last week with healthy gains, though stocks wobbled between small gains and losses on Friday amid the conflicting signals about the trade talks.</p>
      <p>In the end, the S&amp;P 500 rallied in the last hour of trading, closing at a record 3,093.08, up 0.3%. That was the fifth straight week of gains for the index, which matches its longest winning streak in the last two years.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up less than 0.1%, to 27,681.24, and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.5% to 8,475.31.</p>
      <p>In other trading, benchmark crude oil lost 75 cents to $56.49 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 9 cents on Friday to settle at $57.24 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Brent crude oil, the international standard, lost 70 cents to $61.81 per barrel. It rose 22 cents on Friday to $62.51 a barrel.</p>
      <p>The dollar fell to 109.00 Japanese yen from 109.18 yen on Friday. The euro rose to $1.1035 from $1.1021.</p>
