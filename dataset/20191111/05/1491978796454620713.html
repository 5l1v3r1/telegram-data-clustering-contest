      <h1>Carli Lloyd hits again as imperious USA overwhelm Costa Rica in 2019 finale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T05:24:07+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 05:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/11/Associated%20Press" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>Carli Lloyd, Morgan Brian score in opening minutes of 6-0 win</li>
        <li>USA finish 20-1-3 in 2019, ending on 23-match unbeaten streak</li>
        <li>Lloyd scored twice in 3-2 victory over Sweden on Thursday</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/carli-lloyd">Carli Lloyd</a> and Morgan Brian scored in the first 10 minutes and Lynn Williams came off the bench to add a pair of second-half goals in the United States’ 6-0 victory over Costa Rica on Sunday night at TIAA Bank Field in the Americans’ final match of the year.</p>
      <p>The US were 20-1-3 in 2019, finishing with a 23-match unbeaten streak.</p>
      <p>Lloyd started the scoring in the fourth minute, taking a long pass from Rose Lavelle and drilling a shot from the left side of the box past goalkeeper Noelia Bermudez. Lloyd scored twice in a 3-2 victory over Sweden on Thursday night.</p>

      <p>Brian added a goal in the 10th minute, taking Lavelle’s pass and sending a scorching shot into the corner of the net. It was especially gratifying for Brian, who grew up in nearby St Simons Island, Georgia, and conducts camps in the Jacksonville area during the offseason.</p>
      <p>US coach Vlatko Andonovski made several substitutions at half-time and it quickly paid dividends.</p>
      <p>Williams converted in the 50th minute off a pass from Tobin Heath. Williams added a second goal in the 68th minute, taking an assist from Jessica McDonald. Williams narrowly missed a hat trick when her point-blank shot was caught by Bermudez late in the game.</p>
      <p>Christen Press and Margaret Purce also added second-half goals.</p>
      <p>US goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris had a relatively easy time, needing to turn back just one shot. The closest Costa Rica came to scoring was when Melissa Herrera hit the cross bar on a shot in the 62nd minute and teammate Priscilla Chinchilla did the same in the 76th minute.</p>
