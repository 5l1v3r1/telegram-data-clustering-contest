      <p>A GoFundMe campaign raised over $30,000 to benefit Hoyt Hutchinson, a man <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911101077268416-photos-baby-trump-balloon-stabbed-beyond-repair-amid-alabama-protests-/">who recently stabbed</a> one of the notorious “Baby Trump” balloons “beyond repair,” according to The Hill.</p>
      <p>The initial target of the ‘Free Hoyt’ campaign was $6,000, but has raised five times as much. The cash will go to pay Hutchinson’s “legal fees and restitutions.”</p>
      <p>Speaking in a video uploaded online, Hutchinson pledged to donate whatever might be left to the Republican Party.</p>
      <p>Hutchinson made headlines Saturday after using a knife to stab a Baby Trump balloon displayed by demonstrators in Tuscaloosa, Florida, to protest the president’s appearance at a college football game. The vandal <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201909131076789125-protesters-inflate-huge-trump-rat-balloon-in-baltimore-ahead-of-republican-conference/">was arrested and charged</a> with felony first degree criminal mischief after attempting to flee the scene, according to The Hill.</p>
      <p>Hoyt was released from custody on a $2,500 bond, the Tuscaloosa Police Department said.</p>
      <p>The balloon characterization of the US president <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906051075632879-uk-woman-stabs-trump-balloon/">appears to be one of several copies</a> of the original Baby Trump balloon made in the UK ahead of Trump’s 2018 visit to London. Since then, US protesters have acquired permission to copy the blimp’s design, and conducted a GoFundMe campaign of their own, vastly exceeding the target of $4,500, which allowed for the purchase of six copies, available for “adoption” by different protest groups across the US. The US copies use the exact same diaper/cellphone design of the original UK balloons.</p>
