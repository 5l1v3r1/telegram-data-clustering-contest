      <p>Dalvin Cook ran for 97 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown on fourth down, and had 86 yards receiving to set up three other scores, helping the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/minnesota-vikings">Minnesota Vikings</a> beat the Dallas Cowboys 28-24 on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Cook, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl">NFL</a> rushing leader, easily outplayed two-time rushing champion Ezekiel Elliott as the Vikings (7-3) beat a winning team on the road for the first time in almost two years. Minnesota was 0-9-1 in its previous 10 such games.</p>
      <p>Amari Cooper had the most circus catches on a night full of them for both teams, including a toe-tapping TD for Dallas’ only lead in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Kirk Cousins threw for two touchdown passes, both to Kyle Rudolph, for just his second victory in nine prime-time road games.</p>
      <p>Elliott had 47 yards on 20 carries after three straight 100-yard games as the Cowboys (5-4) fell into a first-place tie with Philadelphia in the NFC East.</p>
      <p>Despite throwing for 397 yards and three touchdowns, Prescott lost to Cousins for the first time after going 4-0 against the former Washington quarterback as a division rival.</p>
      <p>Cousins, who had 220 yards passing, beat the Cowboys for the second time in eight tries as the Vikings kept pace in the NFC North, a game behind division-leading Green Bay.</p>
      <p>Trailing by four in the final two minutes, the Cowboys had a first down at the Minnesota 19 but insisted on continuing to force the ball to Elliott when the Vikings had made it clear they were stopping him first.</p>
      <p>Two runs netted minus-3 yards, and the Cowboys went to Elliott again on fourth down even though it was a pass. Linebacker Eric Kendricks broke up the sideline throw to Elliott, a dual threat like Cook but not on this night. He had two catches for 16 yards.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys got the ball back with 17 seconds left, but Jayron Kearse intercepted Prescott’s desperation pass from near midfield in the end zone.</p>
      <p>The Vikings thought they had gone ahead on what was ruled a 17-yard touchdown by Alexander Mattison, but he was ruled down at the 1 on review. After a false start and a third-down stuff of fullback CJ Ham from the one, Cook scored on fourth-and-goal from the 2 on the final play of the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Rudolph, who started the night of circus catches with a one-handed grab in the back of the end zone and scored on another short TD toss, put Minnesota up 28-21 by winning a jump ball with cornerback Chidobe Awuzie for a two-point conversion.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys had a first down at the Minnesota six, but settled for a field goal and a 28-24 deficit after one of several smothered runs by Elliott was followed by two incompletions.</p>
      <p>With the Cowboys trailing 14-0, Cooper kick-started their first TD drive with a heel-dragging catch on third-and-12, followed two plays later by Michael Gallup’s 23-yard scoring grab.</p>
      <p>Then the player Dallas gave up a first-round pick for at midseason last year had two toe-dragging catches in a row, the second a 12-yard touchdown strike that put the Cowboys in front for the first time 21-20 in the third quarter. Cooper had 11 catches for 147 yards.</p>
      <p>Randall Cobb made a lunging catch in the end zone on a 22-yard touchdown catch.</p>
