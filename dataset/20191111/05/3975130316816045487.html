      <h1>SpaceX Launches Another 60 Starlink Satellites, Sets Two Rocket Reuse Records</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from CNBC: <i>SpaceX <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/watch-spacex-livestream-launching-second-starlink-internet-mission.html">launched another 60 of its internet satellites on Monday morning from Cape Canaveral, Florida</a>, in a mission that set two new company records for reusing its rockets. Starlink represents SpaceX's ambitious plant to create an interconnected network of as many as 30,000 satellites, to beam high-speed internet to consumers anywhere in the world. This was the second full launch of Starlink satellites, as SpaceX <a href="https://science.slashdot.org/story/19/05/24/056247/spacex-launches-60-starlink-satellites-on-thrice-flown-rocket-sticks-landing">launched the first batch of 60 in May</a>. The company sees Starlink as a key source of funding while SpaceX works toward its goal of flying humans to and from Mars. <br/><br/>Monday's launch also represented the fourth mission for this SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket booster, which landed and was reused after three previous launches, making this the first time the company landed a rocket booster four times. The booster, the large bottom portion of the rocket, previously launched satellites and then landed successfully for missions in July 2018, October 2018 and February 2019. Additionally, SpaceX used a fairing (the rocket's nosecone) that the company fished out the Atlantic Ocean after a mission in April -- the first time a company has refurbished and used that part of a rocket again. The company has been working to catch the fairing halves in a net strung above the decks of two boats, using parachutes and onboard guidance systems to slowly fly the fairings back into the nets. SpaceX caught its first fairing half on a boat in June.</i> "We deployed 60 more Starlink satellites. This puts us one step closer to being able to offer Starlink internet service to customers across the globe, including people in rural and hard to reach places who have struggled to access high speed internet," SpaceX engineer Lauren Lyons said on the webcast.</p>
