      <h1>Lockdown Lite is a lightweight app to lock your Android apps behind a PIN, pattern or fingerprint</h1>

      <p>There are several reasons why a user might want to lock apps separately, even in addition to the global lockscreen. For this reason, most Android OEM UX’s now come with an app locker baked in, allowing users to quickly lock down app access without needing any extra app. However, if your phone does not have such functionality built-in, you can try any of the countless app lockers on the Google Play Store. To make your hunt easier, check out Lockdown Lite, a lightweight app that can lock Android apps behind a password or fingerprint.</p>
      <p><a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-lockx-applock-small-fast-secure-0-t3955960/">LockX</a> by XDA Member <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=10070621">_RedT_</a>, or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.lockx">Lockdown Lite</a> as it is known on the Google Play Store, is an app locker in its functionality. Lockdown Lite can lock any app on your phone, and can also prevent them from getting uninstalled. However, the standout feature on the app is its small size and negligible footprint, with the app coming in at just 1.32MB in size after installation on my OnePlus 7 Pro.</p>

      <p>The app is very easy to setup. It does need the accessibility service permission, which we advise <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/working-as-intended-an-exploration-into-androids-accessibility-lag/">not granting to any and every app</a> (so grant this permission at your discretion). Further, Lockdown Lite uses two permissions — Internet, for ads, and permission for fingerprint to enable the fingerprint unlock feature. You can use either PIN or Pattern lock as your base unlocking mechanism, and then enable fingerprint unlocking on top. For PIN, you can choose between 4, 5, or 6 digit PIN; and for pattern lock, you can choose between 3×3, 4×4, and 5×5 grids, and further customize it by choosing to not show the pattern line as you draw it. You can also choose how frequently the app locks down the target app, so you have some flexibility here.</p>
