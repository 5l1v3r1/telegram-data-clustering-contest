      <p><i>Try this parenting hack to empathy, better communication and kindness</i> <br/><br/>The birthday boy was in his 70s. As my little girl and I greeted him, he grinned widely, showing off a neat set of dentures. “You look so nice when you smile,” she told him cheekily. He frowned. She reminds me of myself, this one. Always cheeky with old folk and making them think deep. <br/><br/>He grew quiet and then a little later, went back to the topic. “You know I’ve been thinking about what you said about me smiling. I’ve heard it before. <br/><br/>People say I don’t smile. And you’re right I don’t,” he said softly. “That’s how I’ve always been. And thinking back to childhood, I don’t think I have ever had anything to smile about. As a child, my parents were always sad, and we hardly ever smiled, come to think of it!” My little girl’s eyes grew weak and she put her head on my shoulder as she listened. A lump in my throat developed, and I wondered what I should say now. You know, to make it better. <br/>Then I remembered a lesson I had taught recently on Empathy. It warned us not to try and line a grey cloud with silver; but to just listen. And if my twelve-year-old could listen, why was I all jumpy. He kept talking. “You know I grew up in a residential school,” he continued, “and our teachers and wardens were rude too. They wanted us to remain where we were – miserable and deprived. They didn’t want to help us up.” The crack in my heart <br/>widened and my little girl let out a loud – “Awwww.” <br/><br/>But his wife jumped in, to line that cloud. “Don’t ruin their mood and yours,” she advised, “it’s your birthday. Why are you telling them all this?” He replied simply, “Because they listen.” <br/><br/>If there is a parenting lesson I’m advertising today, it’s develop empathy. As a parent, all you have to do is watch a child react to something painful. You will not see cold sympathy. You will see silent empathy – the best kind. <br/><br/>As a child, I hated visiting old folk – my mum’s favourite past time. She would visit them, take them food, make conversation, play a board game with them sometimes and take me along for entertainment. I was not always happy to go. Random old people. Someone else’s parents. <br/><br/>Today, I have bitten the bug and do the same with my children. They, of course, are much warmer than I was. They enjoy the conversations, plus diabetic people know how to really enjoy a donut, or a forbidden bar of chocolate. I’ve had more wisdom come at me over a cup of coffee, than from any course I ever did. And we all appreciate life more after such senior-citizen encounters. <br/><br/>If you are inspired (and I pray that you are), a few things to keep in mind when you do: Don’t talk; listen. One thing that always helps is remembering that behind the grey, hairy face (yes, grandmas have moustaches too!) and spectacles, is an adult who can pretty much see, hear and think. Someone with dignity and intelligence. Give them that. Speak at that level without histrionics and negative assumptions. <br/><br/><br/>Keep conversations short and let the children work their magic on the old folk. A word or two about respect before the visit helps children prep mentally. Keep visits short too. Thank me later! <br/><br/>Speaking of thanking, Mum – here’s to you. <br/><br/><br/>And finally, whenever you see a child, any child – smile. It might change their life.</p>
