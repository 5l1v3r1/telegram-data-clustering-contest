      <h1>If Your Ubuntu 19.10 Or GNOME-Based Installation Keeps Locking Up, You’re Not Alone</h1>

      <p>During a recent community game night I hosted, an aggravating problem cropped up on my installation of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/11/05/my-search-for-the-perfect-linux-os-just-ended--with-an-unexpected-surprise/#f5157955cd6e">Pop!_OS 19.10</a>. <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/2208">Launching <i>CS:GO</i></a> locked up my desktop. Several community members on the stream expressed having the same issue. Despite GNOME’s historical stability (at least in my recent experience) this was a game-breaking bug, but thankfully I was able to boot into Kubuntu 19.10 and get the show on the road.

      <p>I can’t speak to the technical issues at the root of the problem, but it revolves around Mutter, the default window manager in the GNOME 3 desktop environment. From what I’ve seen, the bug is especially prevalent in gaming sessions but could extend beyond that.</p>
      <p>This bug affects any distribution shipping GNOME 3.34.</p>
      <p>The good news is that folks at GNOME, Canonical and System76 are on top of the issue.</p>

      <p>Carl Richell, CEO of System76, sent me a message this morning that only reinforces why I appreciate that company: they’re nimble and they act as quickly as humanly possible. Here’s what Richell had to say: “We pushed updates to Mutter Friday morning [from the Ubuntu proposed repository] and users have reported that it resolved the issue for them. The same updates will be in Ubuntu soon as well.”</p>
      <p>I can happily confirm that installing the latest update on my Oryx Pro running Pop!_OS 19.10 resolved the issue, so a solution is definitely headed your way.</p>

      <p>I would assume the fix is already working its way upstream to benefit all Ubuntu and GNOME 3.34 desktop users.</p>
      <p>So if you’ve switched away from any of your Ubuntu, Manjaro, Fedora or other favorite distros running GNOME 3.34, check back in for updates. Hopefully the issue gets resolved across the board soon.</p>
