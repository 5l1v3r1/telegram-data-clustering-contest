      <p>GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) - The Arizona Coyotes have signed general manager John Chayka to a long-term contract extension.</p>
      <p>Terms of the deal announced Monday were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>Chayka has built the Coyotes into playoff contenders since becoming the youngest general manager in North American major sports history at 26 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Arizona came up four points short of the postseason in 2018-19 and is off to a 9-6-2 start this year.</p>
      <p>Chayka has overhauled the Coyotes’ roster, adding players like Phil Kessel, Nick Schmaltz, Antti Raanta and Michael Grabner through trades and free agency.</p>
