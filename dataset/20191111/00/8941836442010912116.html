      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - A public health study says Native Hawaiians experience fewer years of good health compared with other ethnic groups in the state.</p>
      <p>The study by University of Hawaii researchers published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health found Native Hawaiians have 14 less years of healthy life than other groups.</p>
      <p>The study is based on a self-reported survey calculates the number of healthy years among the state’s indigenous people and those with white, Filipino, Japanese, and Chinese heritages.</p>
      <p>The study finds Native Hawaiians have 62.2 years of healthy life expectancy, compared with 75.9 years for Chinese, 74.8 for Japanese, 73.3 for Filipinos, and 72.1 years for white Hawaii residents.</p>

        <p>The authors say the analysis provides a more complete estimate of population health than life expectancy studies.</p>
