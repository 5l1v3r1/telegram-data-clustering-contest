      <p>Christian McCaffrey was getting the ball. That much the Green Bay Packers were certain of.The only questions were how? And could the Packers stop the Carolina Panthers’ all-everything running back?</p>
      <p>“He’s a stud,” Packers cornerback Kevin King told reporters. “How do you not give him the ball?”</p>
      <p>Fortunately for the Packers, they had a few studs on their side, too.</p>
      <p>On the final play of one of the most memorable games of this NFL season, Carolina sent McCaffrey off left guard from the 2-yard line. Green Bay’s Kyler Fackrell and Preston Smith combined to stop McCaffrey inches shy of the goal line.</p>
      <p>After a lengthy booth review, the call was confirmed and Green Bay left with a thrilling 24-16 win in a made-for-TV game played in a steady snow.</p>
      <p>“In situations like that, teams give the ball to their best players,” Packers safety Adrian Amos told reporters. “So, in a situation like that, maybe I didn't expect them to run it. But we stopped it and it was good.”</p>
      <p>It sure was. But the Packers might have been in trouble if it wasn’t for a last-second adjustment by inside linebacker Blake Martinez.</p>
      <p>Just milliseconds before the ball was snapped, Martinez moved outside linebacker Kyler Fackrell into the ‘A’ gap. Fackrell, now in the perfect position, bounced off a block and made immediate contact with McCaffrey. Smith arrived a split-second later and hit McCaffrey low.</p>
      <p>McCaffrey spun forward and Panthers guard Greg Van Roten tried pulling him towards the endzone. But McCaffrey landed just inches short of the goal line, and this game played in a snow globe had an ending that no one will soon forget.</p>
      <p>“We’re resilient,” Smith told reporters afterwards. “We’re going to fight ‘til the end, until the clock is at zero. We’re going to play our hearts out, we’re going to give it our all, we’re going to empty our tank out there each and every week.”</p>
      <p>The Packers certainly did that.</p>
      <p>Green Bay, which led by 14 points heading to the fourth quarter, held a 24-16 advantage when Carolina took over on its own 11-yard line with 2:25 remaining. The Panthers proceeded to march 87 yards and reached Green Bay’s 2-yard line with 4 seconds left.</p>
      <p>The Packers knew McCaffrey would get the ball. They just weren’t sure how.</p>
      <p>“It was one of the things that we communicated,” Martinez, who played for two seasons with McCaffrey at Stanford, told reporters. “We were like 50/50 wondering – 50/50 pass/run – but it was a situation where you thought there’s only 4 seconds left. Who knows if they’re going to try to run it. Maybe they want to try to get a pass play here or there. So, it was one of things that we communicated.”</p>
      <p>Martinez, who runs the Packers’ defense, got his unit set.</p>
      <p>The Panthers lined up with four receivers — two on each side — and McCaffrey one step behind Allen and to his right. Green Bay went to its dime package, along with nose tackle Kenny Clark, outside linebackers Za’Darius Smith, Preston Smith and Fackrell, and Martinez on the inside.</p>
      <p>Fackrell initially lined up over the right tackle, but Martinez moved him between the left guard and center. That move by Martinez might have been the difference between Green Bay leaving the field victorious and Carolina having a chance to tie the game with a two-point conversion.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately the play was close,” Panthers coach Ron Rivera said. “It was a game of inches.”</p>
      <p>McCaffrey is tied for the league lead in total touchdowns (14) and leads the league in yards from scrimmage (1,385). And while the Packers were certain the ball was going to the Panthers’ best player, stopping him was an entirely different matter.</p>
      <p>“When I came in and sat down I said, ‘Well, they went out with their guy. That’s the way they should have did it.’ They gave it to McCaffrey,” Packers cornerback Tramon Williams told reporters afterwards. “I think they were trying to pass it before then, all of the rest of the downs.</p>
      <p>“I guess they probably thought about it too and were like, ‘All right. 22’s our guy. If we’re going to go out, we’re going to go out with him.’ And that’s what they did. I give respect to them for that. Christian McCaffrey’s a great player. He’s tough to deal with for any defense, but we came up with a stop at the end, which was great for our defense.”</p>
      <p>Bend, but don't break has become the formula for Green Bay’s defense. That, of course, is risky business.</p>
      <p>For example, Carolina had 401 total yards and 26 first downs Sunday. But Allen fumbled the ball away once and was also intercepted by Williams.</p>
      <p>“It’s not good enough,” said Allen who threw for 307 yards and a touchdown. “I had too many turnovers today. Too many missed opportunities by me. We knew coming in against this team, they’re a team that doesn’t turn the ball over much.</p>
      <p>“Aaron (Rodgers) does a really good job of not turning the ball over and making plays when he needs to. And for me to turn the ball over twice, it put us in a bad position, and I think at the end of the day, that’s the main reason why we lost, turnovers. It’s the biggest thing in the league and for us to have two and for them to have zero is a big reason why we lost.”</p>
      <p>That — and a memorable play by Preston Smith, Fackrell and the incredibly heady Martinez.</p>
      <p>“It did take it to the limit, but we’re not trying to play like that all year,” Clark told reporters. “That’s a dangerous way to play, and it’s an emotional way to play. You don’t want every game coming down to like that, we’ve got to put games like that away. But it’s a great performance, it shows the heart of our guys, it shows the character of our guys.”</p>
