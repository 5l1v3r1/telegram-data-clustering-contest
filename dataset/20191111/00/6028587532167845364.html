      <p>The launch of Google Stadia is just over a week away on November 18, and now the company has just confirmed <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/stadia/lineup-games-coming-to-stadia/">a list of 12 games</a> that will be available to play from moment one. They include some major titles, but many on the…older side, shall we say.Here’s the full list that Google has just published today:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection</li>
        <li>GYLT</li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>
        <li>Kine</li>
        <li>Mortal Kombat 11</li>
        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Rise of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>SAMURAI SHODOWN</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Google promises 14 more games by the end of 2019, and some of those include <i>Ghost Recon Breakpoint, Rage 2, Metro Exodus</i> and <i>Wolfenstein Youngblood</i>. Past that, titles like <i>Watch Dogs Legion, Cyberpunk 2077,</i> <i>God and Monsters</i> and <i>Doom Eternal</i> are coming to Stadia, the last of which was supposed to be a launch title before a delay.</p>

      <p>But as you can see we are starting with a number of AAA titles that are at least a year or two old at this point, whether that’s <i>Destiny 2, AC: Odyssey, Red Dead 2 </i>and two <i>Tomb Raiders</i>. <i>Mortal Kombat 11</i> was released this April, so it’s one of the newer, larger ones on the list. One you might never have heard of, <i>GYLT</i>, is a smaller, Stadia exclusive puzzle game.</p>
      <p>This all does feel more like an early test run than the launch of a new console, which I think Google understands, though consumers may not. Granted, even new console launches don’t arrive with a ton of new games, but they are usually…new games, and that can only said about a couple smaller titles here with Stadia.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the goal with Stadia is clearly to get new releases arriving on the platform the same time that they arrive on PlayStation, Xbox or PC, though it may take some time to get to that point. Also, it sound be said once again, because I am still seeing people being confused, this is <i>not</i> Netflix-for-games which gets you all the titles on the list for a subscription fee. Rather, you still are buying individual games like you would on any other digital marketplace, outside of a few exceptions that <i>will</i> be offered for free when you subscribe to the 4K streaming tier.</p>
      <p>Launch is a week away, and we’ll see how these games perform soon enough. Stay tuned.</p>
