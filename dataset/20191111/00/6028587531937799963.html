      <h1>How Allstate Built An Analytics Company Anticipating Major Changes In Transportation</h1>

      <p>The average automobile in the United States is used four percent of the day. When they are used, they are extremely dangerous, with roughly 40,000 people dying in auto accidents per annum. Those who live, spend increasing amounts of time in traffic, as roads become choked with increasing numbers of commuters. In most major cities, the highway and street infrastructure did not anticipate the explosive growth in drivers. Ridesharing services such as Lyft and Uber and the promise car sharing more generally and eventually autonomous driving offer hope that there may be a more efficient and safer path forward. Among the many downstream consequences will be a major change in insurance. When the cars drive themselves, is there a need to insure human drivers? Though it appears that reality is years away, Allstate has made a number of investments anticipating great changes in property and casualty insurance.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the company created a start up called Arity. The goal was to build a team and technology to synthesize driving data to more accurately price insurance. Gary Hallgren is now the President of Arity, and he describes Arity’s founding, its mission, the advantage of being a start up under the umbrella of a $40 billion revenue company, and the progress that has been made in the nine years since the company’s founding.</p>

      <p><b>Peter High:</b> You have been the President of Arity for a bit over three years. For those who may not be familiar with Arity, please provide an overview of your business. </p>
      <p><b>Gary Hallgren:</b> Arity was founded a few years ago, and it grew out of the Allstate Corporation. Everyone knows Allstate as a large property and casualty insurance company, but there is a variety of other businesses inside of it as well. Arity is a technology and data analytics company with a focus on helping organizations through the changing pace of transportation.</p>
      <p><b>High:</b> What was the need or opportunity that Allstate foresaw in creating Arity?</p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> In 2010, there was some thinking around how transportation was going to change and how insurance pricing was going to change with it. Insurance is an interesting industry because you do not know what a product is going to cost when you sell it. Because of this, companies generally have to come up with other ways to accurately price insurance. This has traditionally been done around who you are. This can involve how old you are, how long you have been driving, and even gender. In the late ‘90s, companies started to use credit variables to score insurance, which ended up being quite predictive. This transformed the insurance industry, and as companies started to look for what was next, Allstate started thinking that there must be something better than how people drive and handle a car. It started to put devices into cars and giving people a discount for sharing data, and the company assumed this was going to be more predictive than other variables. By collecting data from millions of drivers over the course of several years, this assumption was proven to be true. Not only was this predictive, but it was the most predictive way to most accurately assess the risk of a driver. Arity’s secret sauce is having a unique ability to identify and quantify risky driving, and the quantifying part is the most important. This component proves that if someone has specific behaviors, those behaviors are going to lead to losses. That is the premise of the company from a technology standpoint. When the question of why Arity came up, the company faced two choices: they could either keep the technology for themselves or look to the industry. Allstate did the latter and realized we had a strategic asset that could be valuable to the rest of the industry, so Arity formed in 2016.</p>
      <p><b>High: </b>Could you talk about how you interact with customers? What value proposition is given back to them?</p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> The three main problems we are looking at are;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Most importantly, the average car is utilized four percent of the time. Even during rush hour, the numbers are in the small double-digits of utilization. Nobody would ever design a system that had vehicles used four percent of the time;</li>
        <li>Driving is extremely unsafe. 40,000 people die on the roads each year. While that number was going down, it is going back up again;</li>
        <li>It is extremely expensive, both in time and money. People spend a great deal of time in traffic each day, and $3 trillion a year is spent on transportation in the U.S.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>People are frustrated by this, but there have not been many options historically. This began to change when rideshare companies started coming into the picture, and people gravitated towards that. There was a great deal of pushback from insurance companies, airports, and the taxi industry because it was a change that they did not want to be disrupted. The reality is that it is good for consumers, and they want to use these services.</p>
      <p>At Arity, we looked at where this disruption was occurring and how we could help improve it. Part of this was with insurance companies because they were being disrupted. Historically, people only have one car to drive to work, but now someone might be sharing your car. You might be in a car with someone else. Your kids might be driving with someone else. We want to assess risk in a different way. For shared mobility companies, there is as interesting a proposition as there is for insurance and automobile companies. Those are the three vertical markets we focus on to make transportation safer, smarter, and more useful.</p>
      <p>Regarding your specific question, it depends on the use case. For example, I want my shared mobility driver to have five stars to prove they are a good drivers. There are opportunities for consumers to better understand that. I split my time between California and Chicago, and I have a car in both places. Because of this, the utilization of my cars is even less. It would be a great feature for me to have someone using my car in each of those locations when I am not there. However, I want to know if they are a good driver. If I can identify and quantify that level of risky driving, I will want to know who is going to be using my car. </p>
      <p>Lastly, on the insurance side, I want to get the most accurate price. I should be paying based on how I drive, not my age or credit. The value proposition to the end consumer is to share data with our customers, who are the insurance companies. The end consumer shares data with them, and we can more accurately price that insurance. I believe this delivers more transparency and more control to the customer than some of these other variables that are extremely hard to change.</p>
      <p><b>High:</b> Can you talk about the team that you have developed? Was the team largely built from people within Allstate or did you hire more people from outside of the company?</p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> We have gone through an interesting continuum. When we originally started, it was people that grew out of the Allstate Corporation because the company had been building this connected car telematics solution for a while. However, we started to bring in more from the outside as well. I never felt as if I was competing against typical Allstate competitors. Instead, I am competing with Google, Facebook, and other telematics companies in downtown Chicago. </p>
      <p>We are creating somewhat of a startup feel while bringing in the legacy of a large corporation, and I believe that is a great value proposition for employees. We have the stability, strength, and resources of a <i>Fortune </i>80 company while being able to work independently in how we operate and grow. We tie the innovation along with that. Blending those two types of cultures together is not easy, and it is always a journey to try to make a great opportunity for employees to innovate and go in amazing directions. That is what we are striving to do.</p>
      <p><b>High:</b> How do you interact with the parent company, Allstate? How often do you interact with executives as opposed to operating more independently as a separate entity? </p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> We have been extremely fortunate in the way that the structure is created. We are owned by the Allstate Corporation, and the Allstate Corporation owns many companies. They own the Allstate Insurance Company, which is their largest company, they own Esurance, which is an insurance company, and they own SquareTrade, which does warranties and are sold through large retailers. They own a dealer services business that delivers services through 10,000 dealerships. Roadside Assistance Program is another example. If you call Roadside Assistance, you are calling an Allstate company. When I think about that, I think about the Allstate Corporation, and when I think about the insurance company, I think about the Allstate Insurance Company. We think of the Allstate Insurance Company as our customer, and they are in a regulated industry. Our corporation is not in the regulated part of the Allstate corporate structure, so we must interface with them in the same way that a vendor and a customer would interface for a whole variety of legal and regulatory reasons. We have a different relationship with the Allstate Corporation. From there, we can leverage a variety of resources, especially around security and cyber. Having the backing of a [major] financial services company that takes security and cyber so seriously gives us great benefits relative to our competitors of similar size. We try to take the best from the Allstate Corporation, and we are fortunate to have customers that are siblings to us inside of the corporate hierarchy. </p>
      <p><b>High:</b> A while back, you wrote a piece called <a href="https://www.arity.com/move/call-smart-city-collaboration-coordination/"><i>A Call For Smart City Collaboration and Coordination</i></a><i>.</i> How do you think about the relationship between an organization similar to yours and the broader infrastructure of the cities in which you operate? </p>
      <p><b>Hallgren</b>: It is such an interesting problem. When you think of the evolution we are going to go through to get from one to the other, everything regarding the usage of vehicles is ridiculously inefficient. If you were running a manufacturing plant that inefficiently, you would just shut it down, retool it, open it back up, and it would be entirely different and far more efficient. No one is going to use assets four percent of the time. However, you cannot just do that in this space. I grew out of an engineering background and worked in the transportation system from the state perspective when I was just out of school. It is even more complicated than just the roads because in any given city, there are state roads, there are county roads, and there are city streets. Each of those is generally controlled by separate organizations, so trying to get stop-lights and construction projects that are synchronized together is extremely difficult. The first part of the smart phase is determining which type of infrastructure and data can be provided so those organizations can work better together. Companies such as ours have interesting insights regarding where accidents happen or where they may happen. Due to our understanding of how to identify and quantify risky driving, we know of areas where there will be accidents. We believe there is a great deal that we can do to provide data or analytics to the cities to help enable them to make that happen.</p>
      <p>The cities are going to need to adapt to when there are traditional vehicles, shared models that are different, semi-autonomous vehicles, and fully autonomous vehicles all on the road. It is a monumental problem, but it is a great problem. If there was simply a 20 percent increase in the utilization and the efficiency of the system, $3,000 would be added to every U.S. household’s pocket. This is a huge amount of money when the nationwide medium income is $56,000 per year. Tying these different modes of transportation together with all these aspects around the cities to make the system more efficient is great for society, and it is going to make consumers lives better. </p>
      <p><b>High: </b>How do you think about autonomous vehicles and semi-autonomy?</p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> My general belief is that it will take much longer than what anybody is thinking. The companies that have been working on this have been pushing out their estimates as they realize that this is an exceedingly difficult problem. I believe the technology in the vehicles is going to be here faster than what we think, but getting them deployed across multiple use-cases will be challenging. I am excited about the idea of long-haul trucks in between large metropolitan areas driving in the middle of the night in platoons. I can see the more consistent components, such as shuttles, vehicles on controlled campuses, and runs to the airport in the near term. However, once you get out of that consistency, it is going to be a much longer tail.</p>
      <p><b>High:</b> To what extent do your experiences regarding how, when, and why people have accidents color how you drive? Has the data been educational for you?</p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> 80 percent of people believe they are better than average drivers. We think about what a hard breaking event is. We are collecting a couple billion miles of driving data every few days. When we can tie that to actual claims data, we start to realize that this type of hard breaking or this type of using your phone while driving leads to accidents. To be able to truly understand that has been a game-changer. When you are driving with others, what they feel is a hard break versus what you feel is a hard break is an arbitrary feeling in people’s minds. We have been able to put the data science behind that to truly know that. I am more cautious and leave more room, but the more interesting aspect to me is the differing perceptions that people have just based upon their experiences. There is simply not much baseline to compare it to, but when you can compare it to 17 million people as we can today, you get a much better definition of what aggressive, good, and bad risk means.</p>
      <p><b>High:</b> You have been involved in many different aspects of the auto industry and the technology-centric aspects of that. Prior to your current role, you were the President of Connected Car at Allstate. Moreover, you worked at an organization called Telogis, which is a platform for location intelligence, and you were the CEO of Remote Dynamics. What drew you to this space initially? </p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> I spent time as a bridge engineer right out of [university], but I migrated into traffic. In the mid-’90s, we pulled data from sensors in the roads, and we used FM radio technology to transfer the data that would show up inside of <a href="https://www.metisstrategy.com/interview/atif-rafiq/">Volvo</a> cars. In real-time, updated every 30 seconds, you could see the roads turn red, green, and yellow based upon traffic. That is absolute commonplace today as it is on Google Maps, Apple Maps, and virtually any traffic app. However, that data did not exist back then, so it was a pipe dream to create that. At some point along the way, the critical mass hit and that suddenly became ubiquitous. The same is going to happen with AVs and pricing of insurance. It sounds brand new, but it will start to catch on a bit. Once you hit that tipping point, it will become commonplace. Much of what I worked on originally is now commonplace, but the genesis of what I have done for the past 20-plus years has been all about making transportation better, understanding data from cars and trucks, and allowing companies and consumers to make better decisions with it. It has been a unifying theme, and in some ways, it seems as if it has sped right by. However, the message I give the young people inside our organization is that what they are working on is going to be the future. However, when they look back, it will simply be commonplace. It will seem obvious that people are priced based upon how they drive and that people will manage their drivers based upon how they drive. </p>
      <p><b>High:</b> Could you give your perspective on the evolution of Chicago as a technology center?</p>
      <p><b>Hallgren:</b> We are a huge fan. Allstate has been a Chicago company for a long time, and the company is 15 miles into the suburbs. I have a personal bias towards the city. It is the right size, it is livable, and it has Midwestern values. I grew up in Minnesota, and I believe there is something great about that Midwestern work ethic. Much of our talent consists of people who have gone to school around here and want to stick around. Further, many people choose to go to another tech center, such as the Bay Area, but end up coming back for a variety of reasons. I picture Chicago being a bit more mature. There is a great deal of youth here, but the environment is less [about] chasing the startup dream and a bit more of creating companies that are creating real value. </p>
      <p>In downtown Chicago, there is an incubator called 1871 that is a few floors from us. There is a great deal of talent in and around the building, and we have created a great office setting here. When we finally get people into this office and they realize the type of data they can work with and the types of problems that can be solved, we can compete with the biggest companies. We have 75 data scientists on the team, and they are working to change transportation. In many places you go to, your job is to try to improve by 0.2 percent. That 0.2 percent might be worth a ton of money, but the fulfillment of that sense of mission that you can bring to companies such as ours is great. To rally around that and around this city is fantastic.</p>
