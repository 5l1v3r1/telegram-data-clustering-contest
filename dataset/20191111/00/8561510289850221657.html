      <h1>A Satellite That Fires Fake Shooting Stars Is Ready to Launch</h1>

      <h3>Night Light</h3>
      <p>Astro Live Experiences, the company that wants to illuminate the night sky with <a href="https://futurism.com/launch-satellite-fake-shooting-stars">artificial shooting stars</a>, is nearly ready for its cosmic debut.</p>
      <p>The tiny satellite, ALE-2, will be launched into orbit on November 25, <a href="https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-launch-shooting-star-satellite.html">according to <i>Space.com</i></a>. After that, the company will run a few final tests before preparing for its first fake meteor shower in 2020. In other words, if all goes well, the night sky is about to be illuminated by awe-inspiring space garbage igniting in the upper atmosphere.</p>
      <h3>Burning Garbage</h3>
      <p>The satellite will launch centimeter-long pellets that will incinerate upon re-entering Earth’s atmosphere. From the ground, they’re expected to look similar to slow-moving shooting stars and will take anywhere from three to ten seconds to burn away, <i>Space.com</i> reports.</p>
      <p>“With this launch, we are a step closer to realiz[ing] the man-made shooting star,” Astro Live Experiences CEO Lena Okajima said, per <i>Space.com</i>. “Please look forward to the world’s first demonstration we are aiming [for] in 2020, which will be a major milestone for ALE.”</p>
