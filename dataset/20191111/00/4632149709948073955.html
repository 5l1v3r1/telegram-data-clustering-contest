      <p>After receiving several complaints from commuters, Bengaluru netas have finally risen to the occasion and decided to link Banashankari Metro and bus stations. There is a plan to build a skywalk within six months along with an integrated mobility hub. Residents from nearby areas, Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya, and revenue minister R Ashok inspected the area on Friday. <br/><br/>Along with R Ashok, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) chairman Nandiesh Reddy, Smart City MD Hepshiba R Korlapati, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) ED Kalpana Kataria were also part of the inspection. Several officials from Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), police, traffic police, BMRCL and BMTC were also present. <br/><br/>“Banashankari is one of the most important nodal points in Bengaluru, connecting JP Nagar and Kanakapura Road. Around 50,000 commuters use the bus stand and around 25,000 use the Metro station daily. Thousands of commuters have to navigate through heavy traffic to reach the Metro station from the bus stand or vice versa. An integrated mobility hub is the need of the hour at this junction so that people can commute seamlessly. This will encourage citizens to use public transport, reducing the traffic congestion in the city,” said Tejasvi Surya.</p>

      <p>— Tejasvi Surya, Bengaluru South MP<br/><br/>Surya proposed building a skywalk connecting the Metro station and the bus stand. The project will be jointly executed by the BMRCL, BBMP and BMTC. Surya also suggested that one of these agencies take the responsibility of the project to avoid inefficiency and lack of coordination. He also asked the officials to ensure the skywalk is differently-abled friendly. <br/><br/><br/>Surya told Bangalore Mirror, “As of now, BMRCL has agreed to build the portion of the skywalk connecting the Metro station to the road. The BBMP will build the portion connection the road and the bus station, while the BMTC will be building the rest.” <br/><br/>The officials also said that a proper place to build the skywalk will be identified soon. <br/><br/><br/>During the inspection, Surya also spoke about the traffic congestion near Banashankari bus stop, on the road leading to Kumaraswamy Layout. On further inspection, it was found out that the government owns unused land next to the bus stop. This could be used for building a bus bay, to ease the traffic flow on the road. The officials were also instructed to begin working on this project immediately.</p>
