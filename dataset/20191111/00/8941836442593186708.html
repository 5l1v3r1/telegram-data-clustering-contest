      <h1>No. 21 Arizona routs Illinois 90-69 behind freshman trio</h1>

      <p>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Nico Mannion</a> dropped in floaters, got into the lane and whipped passes through traffic.</p>
      <p>Josh Green drained 3-pointers, finished at the rim and played lockdown defense.</p>
      <p>Zeke Nnaji bulled his way to the basket, knocked down midrange jumpers.</p>
      <p>It’s just the second game of the season, but Arizona’s heralded freshman trio is playing as advertised.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a> scored 23 points, Green added 20 and Nnaji had 19 in No. 21 Arizona’s 90-69 rout over Illinois on Sunday night.</p>

      <p>“The three freshman were spectacular tonight in their second game,” Arizona coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sean-miller/">Sean Miller</a> said. “Each of them were really, really good.”</p>
      <p>Arizona (2-0) was good at both ends, shooting 56% while nabbing 14 steals. The Wildcats turned a tight game at halftime into a rout with a 17-2 second-half run behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a>, Green and Nnaji.</p>
      <p>Nnaji made 9 of 12 shots, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a> had nine assists and Green was 4 for 7 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>“Everyone played sound tonight,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a> said. “We had four, five guys in double digits and the guys who weren’t in double digits were doing their thing, locking up on defense, making the right plays.”</p>

        <p>Illinois (2-1) was able to hang with the Wildcats in the first half of a high-level game with more than two dozen NBA scouts on hand.</p>
        <p>The Illini went cold in the second half and struggled holding onto the ball, turning it over 22 times.</p>
        <p>Ayo Dosunmu led Illinois with 15 points and Trent Frazier added 14.</p>
        <p>“It doesn’t matter what offense we run, we’re finding way to turn the ball over,” Illinois coach Brad Underwood said. “Arizona doesn’t pressure. They let you just run your stuff and it’s a frustrating trend.”</p>
        <p>Sunday night’s game was the first big test for both teams.</p>
        <p>Arizona used its size advantage to open the season with a blowout victory over Northern Arizona.</p>
        <p>Illinois needed overtime to beat Nicholls State at home and blew out undersized Grand Canyon in a rowdy atmosphere Friday.</p>
        <p>The GCU part got the Illini ready for another of college basketball’s best atmospheres at McKale Center.</p>
        <p>Illinois made seven of its first eight shots and Frazier had eight points in the first 4½ minutes.</p>
        <p>“This is my third year, playing in these crazy environments is nothing new to me,” Frazier said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a> matched him, scoring on a 3, a floater, a putback and set up Nnaji for a dunk with a baseball pass in traffic .</p>
        <p>The offensive show continued the rest of the half. Frazier had 12 points and Illinois hit 15 of 27 shots.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a> had 11 points, Arizona went 16 for 30 and led 39-38 on Max Hazard’s last-second 3-pointer .</p>
        <p>Arizona tightened up on defense to start the second half and went on an early 8-0 run to go up nine.</p>
        <p>Illinois answered with a 7-0 run, but Arizona’s freshman took over and the Wildcats scored 15 straight points to go up 68-52.</p>
        <p>Illinois went 5:11 without a field goal during the run and shot 10 of 26 in the second half.</p>
        <p>“When they went on that 15-0 run, that was pretty much game,” Dosunmu said.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Illinois was long and athletic enough to hold its own against a Top-25 team like Arizona, but must cut down on the turnovers and get a better offensive flow.</p>
        <p>Arizona’s talented freshman can take the Wildcats a long way if they keep playing like this.</p>
        <p>ARIZONA’S TURNOVERS</p>
        <p>Illinois wasn’t the only team to struggle with turnovers. Arizona had 16, including five by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nico-mannion/">Mannion</a>, that led to 15 points for Illinois.</p>
        <p>“Sixteen turnovers are too many,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/sean-miller/">Miller</a> said. “I would say a few of them happened because it’s only the second time we’ve played this year and we need to get used to being out there.”</p>
        <p>NO KOFI</p>
        <p>Kori Cockburn, Illinois’s 7-foot freshman, dominated against Grand Canyon, scoring 23 points and grabbing 14 rebounds.</p>
        <p>He was not nearly as much of a factor Sunday night thanks to Arizona’s defense, finishing with nine points and seven rebounds.</p>
        <p>“Kofi had that monster game and just dominated in the paint, we knew they were going to double team him,” Frazier said. “We just didn’t do a good job of pump faking and skipping it to the other side. We need to do a better job of following the game plan and executing on offense.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>Illinois hosts Hawaii on Nov. 18.</p>
        <p>Arizona hosts San Jose State on Thursday.</p>
