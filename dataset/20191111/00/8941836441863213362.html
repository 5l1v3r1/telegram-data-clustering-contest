      <p>MOSCOW (AP) - A St. Petersburg court has rejected a defense lawyer’s request for a prominent Russian history professor who’s suspected of murdering and dismembering a female student to be released under house arrest pending trial.</p>
      <p>The court on Monday ordered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oleg-sokolov/">Oleg Sokolov</a> detained for two months.</p>
      <p>The case has attracted wide attention in Russian media because of its grisly aspects.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oleg-sokolov/">Sokolov</a> was detained Saturday after being pulled from St. Petersburg’s Moika River, where a backpack containing two severed arms also was found. The arms were identified as those of the student; other body parts were found in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/oleg-sokolov/">Sokolov</a>’s home near the river.</p>
