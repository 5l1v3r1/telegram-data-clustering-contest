      <p>The threat of cataclysm in the UK’s troubled steel industry — a collapse of its second-largest producer, British Steel — has been averted, for now. Chinese steelmaker Jingye has agreed to buy the ailing company, the UK government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-steel-limited-in-liquidation-information-for-customers-employees-and-creditors">confirmed</a> today, ending weeks of uncertainty during which it had struggled to find a buyer. Although the deal still faces regulatory hurdles, if concluded it would safeguard thousands of jobs in the UK, mostly at British Steel’s Scunthorpe operations in Lincolnshire. And it would bring stability to a firm that has faced upheaval as the steel industry contends with a host of international trade challenges, not least because of Brexit. </p>
      <p>“While there remains much work still to be done, today’s announcement is a huge hurdle overcome on the way to delivering a sustainable future for this cornerstone of British industry,” said Gareth Stace of UK Steel, an industry group. </p>
      <p>For months, the fate of British Steel and its thousands of jobs has been uncertain. Hit hard by slowing demand related to Brexit, British Steel was forced into compulsory liquidation in May. The UK has sought a buyer for the ailing firm but, until now, had failed to find one. Recent talks to sell the business to Ataer, an investment arm of Turkey's military pension scheme, have come up short. </p>
      <p>Trade groups expressed relief at the prospect of long-term investment. “This is a real milestone in the campaign to ensure the long term future of British Steel,” said Steve Turner of Unite, a British and Irish trade group. “Local trade union representatives have met with officials from Jingye and received positive assurances that the company is committed to the long-term future of British Steel and is prepared to commit significant investment.” </p>
      <p>But the deal doesn’t doesn’t solve all the company’s problems. In order to remain competitive in a tough trade environment, British Steel may still need to cut costs. </p>
      <p>These have been rough years for the steel industry. A wave of cheap imports from China has washed over the market: China’s steel exports rose <a href="https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/imports/china.asp">nearly 350 percent</a> between 2009 and 2019, according to the US’ International Trade Administration. And a perpetually postponed Brexit has made it nearly impossible for buyers to anticipate the tariffs that steel products will face when crossing the border. Rather than face that uncertainty, many customers have reduced their orders. </p>
      <p>The deal with Jingye could also fan concerns of growing Chinese influence. Chinese investment in Europe has soared in the last decade. Last year China invested $4.94 billion in the UK, according to <a href="https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/newsroom/2019/01/chinese-fdi">a report</a> by law firm Baker Mckenzie. That was a sharp drop from 2017, in line with a trend of lower Chinese foreign direct investment in recent years, though still more than any other European country. </p>
      <p>Andrew Adonis, a former chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, castigated the deal on Twitter. </p>
      <p>“China destroys British Steel by dumping cheap steel, courtesy of the Cameron/Osborne government which resisted tough EU anti-dumping measures because they were sucking up to President Xi,” Adonis <a href="https://twitter.com/Andrew_Adonis/status/1193771888859897857?s=20">wrote</a>. “Now it buys the remnants for a pittance.” </p>
