      <p>Imagine being part of a field and shaping the future for everyone in it. A rare few can attest to being such pioneers. The Hollywood facialist <a href="https://sonyadakar.com/">Sonya Dakar</a> is one such person. The world-famous skincare guru changed the game back in 1983 with her groundbreaking skin care formulas. Now, over 30 years later, Dakar remains as revered as ever and is giving Hollywood stars more than just a simple makeover. Dakar prides herself on being an innovator in her line of work. Natural oils may be a trend today, for example, but she was among the first to use them back in the day. She also documented her clients’ skin with Polaroid cameras.</p>
      <p>“Nobody thought to do this,” she said, explaining just how deeply she gets into the nitty gritty of each of her clients. “This isn’t a regular facial; this is a boot camp.”</p>

      <p>Being the elite trendsetter she is, it’s no surprise that Dakar and her products still garner a reputation for being top notch in the wellness industry- even after all these years when the market is flooded with skincare lines. </p>
      <p>Of all the places where her name is plastered, however, there’s none more special than at the <a href="https://www.dorchestercollection.com/en/rome/hotel-eden/spa/spa-treatments/">Hotel Eden</a>, in Rome, widely regarded as the city’s most upscale property.</p>
      <p>At Dakar’s eponymous spa at the Eden- a chic intimate space that only accommodates four guests at a time- her oils, cleansers and techniques are featured in nearly every massage and facial. </p>
      <p>“The relationship we have with Eden is really amazing and genuine,” says Dakar.</p>
      <p>She was introduced to the Eden through the wife of the hotel’s general manager, Luca Virgilio, who tried and loved her facial at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>Soon after, the Eden called on her expertise to create innovative and effective treatments, all of which have been a huge hit with clients (make an appointment well in advance if you hope to get in). Some of these include her nano apple stem cell complex cream, which reverses the effects of aging and annihilates puffy eyes, and a head massage with Hoya flower essential oil, which rehydrates dry scalps.   </p>

      <p>Dakar now visits the hotel twice a year to train therapists on her techniques and share her newest skincare finds.  Her latest trip is this month, and on November 12th and 13th, she will also be giving hour-long consultations and facials to a select few high-profile guests. While Dakar loves her trips, she says that she wishes she had some spare time to go shopping in the Eternal City. “It’s just so incredible there,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dakar also said that she is working closely with Eden Hotels to extend her services to their properties in London and Milan in the near future. Europe will be taken by storm and look more fabulous than ever soon enough!</p>
