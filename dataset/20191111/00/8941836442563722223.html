      <p>BANGOR, Maine (AP) - The University of Maine System is rolling out rules for students who’re called up to military service.</p>
      <p>The new policy covers academic accommodations, tuition and housing rebates, and re-admission for students who are called up to active duty. It calls for a full tuition waiver for Maine National Guard members, and guarantees spouses and dependents aren’t evicted during a mobilization.</p>
      <p>Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the new policy highlights the ways the system will accommodate and support students when their military service interrupts their education.</p>
