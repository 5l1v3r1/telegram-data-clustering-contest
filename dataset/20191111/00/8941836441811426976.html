      <p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Giannis Antetokounmpo couldn’t contain his frustration after a subpar first half.</p>
      <p>Somewhere between the court and the locker room, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Milwaukee Bucks</a> star kicked - and destroyed - a sign with a Thunder logo that is part of a temporary barrier.</p>
      <p>The reigning league MVP regretted his actions.</p>
      <p>“You know, there’s no excuse there, and obviously I’ll try to pay for the sign, or I can trade you guys for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> sign when you guys come to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>,” he said. “But there’s no excuse for that. But obviously, playing basketball is a lot of frustration and a lot of emotion, and obviously, moments like that happen.”</p>
      <p>He channeled his fire in the second half. He scored 24 of his 35 points after the break to help the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Milwaukee Bucks</a> rally and beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-119 on Sunday night.</p>

      <p>His first half, by his standards, was forgettable. He scored 11 points on 4-for-8 shooting and had six rebounds. Most important, the Thunder led by six.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t playing good basketball,” he said. “I wasn’t being as aggressive as I wanted.”</p>
      <p>In the second half, he made 9 of 11 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds.</p>
      <p>Thunder guard Chris Paul said it’s a challenge to defend a 6-foot-11 player who can drive.</p>

        <p>“You think ‘back up, back up,’ but by the time you keep backing up, he’s at the rim,” Paul said.</p>
        <p>Eric Bledsoe added 25 points and nine assists for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a>, who have won five of six.</p>
        <p>Dennis Schroder scored 25 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 22 for the Thunder, who had won three straight home games.</p>
        <p>The Thunder led by nine points early in the third quarter before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> rallied and led 87-80 heading into the fourth.</p>
        <p>Oklahoma City’s Danilo Gallinari hit a 3-pointer with 32.3 seconds left to tie the game at 114, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>’s Brook Lopez made a 3-pointer at the other end with 25.4 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Gallinari missed a clean look at a 3, then <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>’s George Hill made two free throws with 10.5 seconds left to put the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> in control.</p>
        <p>“We always fought back, and we didn’t shoot the ball the way we usually do, especially me,” Gallinari said. “It was a very good game. Unfortunately we couldn’t get it done.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a>: F Kyle Korver sat out with a head contusion. … G Khris Middleton left the game with a left thigh contusion and did not return. He finished with 10 points. … Lopez was called for a technical foul in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Thunder: C Steven Adams sat out with a left knee contusion. Coach Billy Donovan said he doesn’t consider the injury serious. … G Andre Roberson (recovery, left knee) still hasn’t played this season.</p>
        <p>KEEP FIRING</p>
        <p>Gallinari was 3 for 15 from the field before he made the game-tying 3-pointer in the final minute. He finished 4 for 17 overall and 2 for 10 from 3-point range. Oklahoma City’s No. 2 scorer for the season entered the night shooting 46.9% from the field overall and 47.5% from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>SECOND HALF SWISHES</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> shot 60.5% in the second half. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> made 21 of 30 shots inside the 3-point line after the break.</p>
        <p>The Thunder shot 52.3% in the second half and made 9 of 21 3-pointers. Schroder scored 17 points in the second half on 6-for-7 shooting.</p>
        <p>QUOTABLE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> coach Mike Budenholzer on holding on against the Thunder in the fourth quarter: “They had 39 points in the fourth quarter, so we are just lucky the clock ran out, but they hit tough shots.”</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/milwaukee-bucks/">Bucks</a> host the Chicago Bulls on Thursday.</p>
