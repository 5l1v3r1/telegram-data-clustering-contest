      <h1>Digital Ad Spend Reaches A Peak – Growth Slowly Starting To Drop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ilker Koksal</a></address>
      <p>According to a <a href="http://www.iab.com/adrevenuereport">report at the Interactive Advertising Bureau</a>, the total digital ad spend for the first six months of 2019 equaled to 57.9 billion dollars. That is 17% more compared to the first six months of 2018, confirming the continuous growth in the digital advertising industry.However, it seems like there has been a shift in this space since this year’s ad spend is slightly lower compared to the second half of 2018. This is the first time these numbers are following a downward trend since 2009.</p>

        <b>Mobile and Social Advertising Sectors</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://postfunnel.com/mobile-advertising-in-2019/">Mobile platforms</a> and social media networks are two of the most popular sectors of digital advertising. Since digital marketing efforts prove to yield more results than the old-school marketing strategies, it is understandable why this area is growing continuously.</p>
      <p>However, the sudden drop in the speed of growth might indicate a change in the advertising industry. What could be the reasons why businesses and advertisers are spending less money and causing the industry’s growth to decline?</p>
      <p>It’s a fact that <a href="https://www.lyfemarketing.com/blog/what-is-digital-advertising/">digital advertising isn’t going anywhere any time soon</a>. The senior vice president of research and analytics at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, Sue Hogan, believes that these advertising categories are maturing, which is the reason why growth statistics are no longer that impressive.</p>
      <p>In other words, so many people have joined the space of digital advertising and the whole concept has grown so much that it has started reaching its peak. However, this doesn’t mean that ad spend statistics are going to drop drastically out of nowhere.</p>
      <p>On the contrary, with brands and businesses already in the game for a while, advertising teams have picked up new strategies to save money and time when running online campaigns. The decline in ad spend numbers could be a result of better organization and ad planning, not an indication that the digital advertising industry might be struggling.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What Does This Mean for the Advertising Industry?</b>
      </p>
      <p>With over four billion people actively using the internet all over the world, it is impossible for an industry such as digital advertising to die out. There will always be brands and businesses looking to expose themselves to the masses and there will always be consumers sitting behind the screens.</p>
      <p>With that said, we don’t have to worry about a small drop in ad spend numbers and its potential meaning. In fact, the digital advertising industry is still expanding and many are going in the direction of video advertising.</p>
      <p>Video advertising has gone up to 9.5 billion dollars this year, making it one of the most popular forms of advertising these days. We don’t know what the future has in store but one thing is for sure – there won’t be a day when digital advertising will no longer exist… at least not yet!</p>
