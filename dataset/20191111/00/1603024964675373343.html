      <p>Shares of <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-public-sector/bankofbaroda/BOB">Bank of Baroda</a> (BoB) jumped more than 5 percent on BSE in the morning trade on November 11 even after some brokerages cut the stock’s target price after the state-owned lender released its quarterly scorecard.</p>
      <p>The public sector lender on November 8 said its July-September quarter profit jumped 73.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 736.7 crore despite a sharp increase in provisions.</p>
      <p>The growth was driven by other income, net interest income (NII) and pre-provision operating profit (PPoP).</p>

      <p>Results are not comparable year-on-year due to the merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with BoB. Hence the sequential growth in profit was 3.8 percent and NII grew by 8 percent, with 19bps expansion in net interest margin at 2.81 percent QoQ.</p>
      <p>Citi has a buy recommendation on Bank of Baroda, with a target price of Rs 115. The global financial firm said BoB's asset quality challenges still persisted and were a binding constraint. Progress on merger integration and NPA resolutions were the key factors, Citi said.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse maintained a neutral call but cut the target price to Rs 105 from Rs 115.</p>
      <p>The foreign brokerage has cut 2020-21 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 21-30 percent on dilution and higher credit costs.</p>
      <p>Kotak Institutional Equities maintained an add rating on the stock but cut the target price to Rs 105 from Rs 135 and said that high provisions dented an otherwise better-than-expected performance.</p>
      <p>"Valuations are inexpensive but the merger process is getting along slowly. Risk-reward is still favourable at the current levels to maintain our positive view," said Kotak Institutional Equities.</p>
      <p>Shares of Bank of Baroda were trading 2.88 percent up at Rs 96.50 on BSE at 0955 hours.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
