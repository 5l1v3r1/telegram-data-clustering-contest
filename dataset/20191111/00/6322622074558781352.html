      <h1>Stocks Edge Up in Asia With S&amp;P 500 at Record</h1>

      <p>(Bloomberg) -- Stocks in Asia nudged higher and U.S. equity futures were steady as investors parsed the latest developments in the trade conflict and kept an eye on Alibaba’s Singles’ Day for a gauge of consumer health in China.<br/>Shares opened modestly higher in Tokyo and Sydney, while South Korean equities were little changed. Contracts on the S&amp;P<br/>500 were flat after the U.S. benchmark index eked out another record high on Friday, as Treasuries continued to decline.</p>
      <p>The 10-year yield ended the week at 1.94%. Veterans Day in the US means no Treasuries trading. President Donald Trump said trade talks with China are moving along “very nicely” and Beijing wants a trade deal “much more than I do.” The offshore yuan was steady after five weeks of gains.</p>
      <p>Data over the weekend showed Chinese factories are threatening to drag down prices around the world as producer<br/>prices dropped for a fourth month in October. Alibaba’s sales event kicked off with a bang, with 136 billion yuan ($19<br/>billion) of purchases in less than five hours. The world’s biggest shopping event could help investors gauge how willing<br/>Chinese consumers are to spend as economic growth threatens to slip below 6% and the trade war drags on.</p>
      <p>An easing of economic worries and signs of progress toward an interim trade deal have helped lift risk assets, with global<br/>equities rising the past five weeks. But further short-term volatility should be expected, according to Shane Oliver, head<br/>of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.</p>
      <p>“Equity valuations are OK, particularly against low bond yields, and global growth indicators are expected to improve by<br/>next year and monetary and fiscal policy are becoming more supportive,” he said. “All of which should support decent gains for share markets on a 6-12 month horizon.”</p>
      <p>In Spain, the Socialists are set to win the greatest number of votes from Sunday’s election, but the fragmented results<br/>point to weeks of negotiations for party leader Pedro Sanchez if he is to form a government.</p>
      <p>Meantime, Saudi Aramco will allow investors to start bidding for shares starting on Nov. 17. The firm said it’ll<br/>provide the number and percentage of shares sold at a later stage, with book-building kicking off this week.<br/>Elsewhere, the pound fluctuated after the U.K.’s sovereign credit rating was placed on negative outlook by Moody’s<br/>Investors Service, which said the country’s ability to set policy has weakened in the Brexit era along with its commitment<br/>to fiscal discipline.</p>
      <p>Here are some key events coming up this week:<br/>* Earnings include Tencent, Nissan Motor, Japan Post Bank and Mitsubishi UFJ.<br/>* New Zealand’s policy decision is due Wednesday, with market pricing tilting in favor of an interest-rate cut.<br/>* Fed Chairman Jerome Powell addresses the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, in Washington Wednesday. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari speaks in La Crosse, Wisconsin.<br/>* Thursday brings China retail sales and industrial production data.<br/>* U.S. retail sales on Friday are forecast to rebound in October after unexpectedly falling the prior month. The health of<br/>American spending is key to extending the record-long expansion.</p>
