      <p>DENVER (AP) - The city of Denver has agreed to pay $300,000 to a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/united-airlines/">United Airlines</a> pilot who was arrested on an indecent exposure charge that was later dismissed by a judge.</p>
      <p>KMGH-TV reports that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-collins/">Andrew Collins</a>‘ attorney, Craig Silverman, announced the settlement on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-collins/">Collins</a> was arrested in September 2018 after being accused of standing naked in front of his 10th-floor hotel window overlooking the Denver International Airport terminal.</p>
      <p>He pleaded not guilty, and a judge dismissed the misdemeanor charge in March. But the incident led to a six-month suspension from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/united-airlines/">United Airlines</a> for the pilot from Leesburg, Virginia.</p>

        <p>Silverman has said that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-collins/">Collins</a> didn’t know that people could see him when he partially opened the curtains of his hotel room.</p>
