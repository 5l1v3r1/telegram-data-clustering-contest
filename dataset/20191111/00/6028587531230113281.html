      <p>From Aspen to Gstaad, stylish women all over the world are blazing down black diamond runs in rainbow one-pieces and bombers emblazoned with stars, stripes and chevron prints. The outfitter livening up the mountain is <a href="https://www.perfectmoment.com/">Perfect Moment</a>, a heritage activewear brand that’s become the uniform of the fashion ski set with colorful, chic ski-wear that goes from on to off piste. Now, more than 30 years after its Chamonix debut, Perfect Moment is skiing into the spotlight with a collaboration with goop, which launched yesterday on <a href="https://www.goop.com/">Goop.com</a> and in the retailer’s permanent stores throughout Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, London and at the Goop MRKT Chicago and Aspen pop-up shops.</p>

      <p>The Goop x Perfect Moment collaboration is a limited-edition collection of ski styles that fuse the activewear brand’s signature aesthetic with highly functional details, like four-way stretch, flexible contour fit, protective kneepads and waterproof, breathable fabrications that offer extreme insulation and warmth. The collection includes nine women’s styles reflecting Perfect Moment’s cool, retro-inspired silhouettes in Goop signature colors, like navy, white and black, and some with nautical stripes and sporty details.</p>
      <p>“I have always admired Gwyneth and the Goop philosophy of exploring, growing, and pushing the boundaries, particularly in the beauty and wellness sectors,” says Jane Gottschalk, Perfect Moment’s creative director. “At Perfect Moment, we share the same passion for exploring the possibility of your ‘best self,’ from the daily routine to the highest mountain peak...so we bring to you a collaboration featuring high-tech, functional ski wear that will ensure you stand out from the crowd and have fun doing it.”</p>

      <p>The Goop x Perfect Moment collection is a stylish mix that’s as perfect on a trail as it is by the fire. There’s a classic Chamonix sweater with a matching jacket, a striped one-piece suit, racing pants, beanie hats, bags and helmets with the Goop logo and Perfect Moment star insignia. The collection ranges from $140 for the “Star Bum Bag” to $840 for a GT Ski one-piece.</p>
      <p>While Perfect Moment feels decidedly <i>of</i> the moment, the brand was founded in 1984 in the mountains of Chamonix, France. At the time, extreme sports filmmaker and professional skier Thierry Donard was designing apparel for expert freeride skiers and surfers for his film production company, La Nuite de la Glisse. Mr. Donard used his personal experience to create pieces that were characterized by quality, style and performance, and focused on the ultimate goal of every athlete - to experience that perfect moment. </p>

      <p>Fast forward to today and the brand’s mission remains - to create stylish, funky, ski, surf and activewear for the ultimate snow and beach lovers. Its star logo, placed on all of its garments, is inspired by the Northern Star that represents nature’s compass – a key tool for any adventurer – and a guiding celestial light for early explorers to get safely home. According to the brand, it’s also a stamp of quality that symbolizes technically exceptional, practical and stylish clothing capable of meeting the robust demands of a freerider. </p>

      <p>In 2010, Ms. Gottschalk, a former stockbroker and trader, invested in Perfect Moment and then fully acquired the business in 2013. She moved the brand’s headquarters from Chamonix to Hong Kong where she lived with her family. “My love of adventure, travel and the mountains fueled my initial attraction to Perfect Moment,” says Ms. Gottschalk. “I love the heritage of the brand - the combination of a distinctly retro sensibility and technical knowhow. We pride ourselves on being authentic, original and functional with a fun nod to fashion.”</p>
      <p>Under Ms. Gottschalk’s direction, Perfect Moment’s team of designers began creating a product line that fits seamlessly into the luxury vision of winter and summer wardrobing, complete with outerwear, swim and surf, and designing for those who want to stay stylish, whether cruising the extreme mountains of Chamonix or the big waves of Hawaii. In addition to swim, active and ski, the brand, which moved to London in 2015, also offers equally stylish collections for men and children, further emphasizing the idea that everyone in the family deserves that perfect moment.</p>
