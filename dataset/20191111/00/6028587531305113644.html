      <p>Lamar Jackson is quickly growing into one of the top players in the National Football League, and the quarterback showed his variety of skills once again on Sunday during Baltimore’s 49-13 rout of Cincinnati.<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28051772/lamar-jackson-joins-elite-club-perfect-passer-rating">ESPN</a> and various other media outlets reported after the game that Jackson finished with a perfect passer rating of 158.3 – and that’s the second time he’s done that this season. Pittsburgh veteran quarterback Ben Roethlisberger is the only other quarterback to earn perfect ratings in more than one season; he did it twice 12 years ago.</p>
      <p>Jackson completed 15 of 17 passes for 223 yards and three touchdowns. The two incompletions were on a quick spike to stop the clock and a pass that tight end Mark Andrews just missed while running in the end zone.</p>
      <p>“I'm a quarterback at the end of the day," Jackson said in that<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28051772/lamar-jackson-joins-elite-club-perfect-passer-rating"> ESPN article.</a> "I want to prove that each and every day I go out and practice. I treat it like it's a game. If I miss a pass at practice, I'm ticked off."</p>
      <p>He also earned a perfect rating in Baltimore’s 59-10 victory over Miami in the season opener two months ago. His performance in this game helped the Ravens win for the fifth straight time and improved their record to 7-2, giving them a two-game lead over Pittsburgh in the AFC North.</p>
      <p>Jackson also ran for 65 yards and a touchdown, which included a wild 47-yard jaunt where the quarterback faked out several Bengals and quickly spun to escape three Cincinnati players. The Baltimore sideline wildly cheered Jackson on as it’s a play that likely will be seen many more times, according to coach John Harbaugh.</p>
      <p>"I said to the offensive coaches on the (headphones), 'They'll be watching that run for decades and decades,” Harbaugh said in the<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28051772/lamar-jackson-joins-elite-club-perfect-passer-rating"> ESPN</a> article. “That's one that everyone in the country is going to see by tomorrow afternoon.”</p>
      <p>ESPN also reported that Jackson is the first quarterback to ever end a game with the perfect passer rating (for at least 15 attempts), at least 50 yards rushing as well as a touchdown run – according to Elias Sports Bureau.</p>
      <p>But despite the big-time passing numbers, and the fact that Jackson helped guide the Ravens to a fifth straight win, that one run is something most will remember about the second-year quarterback’s performance in this game.</p>
      <p>The quick spin move is what most will likely think of regarding Jackson’s performance in this game and could possibly become a signature for Jackson in the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>"It was multiple people that fell for the spin move,” Baltimore running back Gus Edwards said to <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/bs-sp-ravens-bengals-lamar-jackson-20191111-rmltl7dc3fhgzliqkmlsotwbuu-story.html">The Baltimore Sun.</a> “I don't think nobody saw it coming. I was ready for him to go down, but I guess you got to expect those type of things out of Lamar. He surprises you every game.”</p>
      <p>The biggest concern about Jackson when picked in the 2018 draft was if he could become a typical NFL drop-back passer. He’s clearly growing into that, but his skills as a runner added to that are making the second-year quarterback one of the most dangerous players in the NFL.</p>
      <p>And it’s a big reason the Ravens are in first place.</p>
      <p>"He's one of the most exciting players I've ever seen," Bengals coach Zac Taylor said in the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28051772/lamar-jackson-joins-elite-club-perfect-passer-rating">ESPN article.</a> "(He's) dynamic. I'm interested to see what teams do down the road here to stop him, because he certainly is hitting on all cylinders right now."</p>
