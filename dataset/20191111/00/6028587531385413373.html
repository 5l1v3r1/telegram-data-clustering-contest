      <h1>New Galaxy S11 Details Reveal Samsung’s Surprising Upgrade</h1>

      <p>With the major phone launches over for another year, the attention of the geekerati turns to the 2020 batch. The biggest beast in the first batch is going to be Samsung’s Galaxy S11 family. And it looks like the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/">South Korean company</a> has a lot of surprises in store.The latest details come from Samsung’s application for a trademark in <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2019/11/samsung-samoled-display.pdf">South Korean</a> and <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/uploads/2019/11/samsung-samoled.pdf">America</a> for ‘SAMOLED’, suggesting that a new screen technology is coming up. If so the flagship Android handsets are the likely benefactors. <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s11-samoled-display/">Ilse Jurrien reports</a>:</p>
      <p>"On November 6, 2019, Samsung Display filed a trademark in the home country of Korea with the KIPO (Korean Intellectual Property Office) for the name SAMOLED. The application is accompanied by a brief description: 'OLED display; smartphone display; monitor; television screen; digital signage; computer screen'. At the same time, the same trademark was also registered with the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office), the publication followed three days later on November 9, 2019.”</p>
      <p>Samsung has always added a little bit of emotion to go along with its additions to OLED screens - <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/technologie/samsung-dynamic-amoled-display/">with dynamic AMOLED being the most recent</a>. The trademark application says that something new is coming, but it doesn’t say what it is.</p>
      <p>But I can make a good guess.</p>

      <p>I would highlight two areas of screen technology that not only make sense for a smartphone being launched in a few months time, but also screen technology that Samsung Display will want to market and sell not just internally to Samsung Mobile, but to other manufacturers.</p>
      <p>The first is the growing popularity of faster refreshing screens. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2017/11/12/razer-phone-review-nextbit-robin-android-gaming/">The Razer Smartphone</a> kicked this off with a 120 Hz LCD screen, but 2019 has seen the rise of the 90Hz OLED based screen on handsets rom the likes of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/09/26/oneplus-7t-review-camera-macro-screen-90hz-android-10-oxygenos/">OnePlus</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-30-pro-999340/">Huawei</a>. It makes sense that Samsung would want to not only step into this market, but to become a major player with more advanced technology. That suggests a 120 Hz AMOLED screen.</p>
      <p>Secondly, will be to increase the curve on the screen. Certainly the flat Galaxy choice of the S11e was attractive to many, but it led to two different ‘hero silhouettes’ at the top. <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1192975629148475393">Noted industry leaker Evan Blass suggests</a> that all of the Galaxy S11 models will switch to a ‘curved’ display, <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-with-four-sided-curved-screen-is-stunningly-innovative">with the potential for the ‘chins’ to be replaced by a curved edge on all four sides</a>.</p>
      <p>That certainly puts the ’S’ in AMOLED, ahead of a probable launch in the week before MWC Barcelona, which is set for February 24th 2020.</p>
