      <h1>Nursery bosses want the power to ban unhealthy junk food from kids' lunchboxes</h1>
      <h2>A survey of nursery managers has shown that three quarters are in favour of being given the ability to ban unhealthy food</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:01:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Alison Kershaw</a></address>
      <p>Nursery bosses and staff believe they should be able to ban junk food and sweet treats from lunchboxes, a poll found.</p>
      <p>The latest NHS data shows 22.6% of four and five-year-olds in reception class are overweight or obese â€“ up 22.4% on the year before. Of these, 9.7% are obese and 2.4% are severely obese.</p>
      <p>The survey of 1,000 nursery owners, managers and staff by daynurseries.co.uk found 73% favoured being able to ban unhealthy food. And 27% said there were children they considered obese in their nursery.</p>
      <p>Sue Learner, editor of daynurseries.co.uk, said that nurseries should be able to advise parents on the food they provide but a ban was a step too far.</p>
      <p>She said: "It is shocking that one in 10 children start school obese. Pre-school years can be instrumental in helping form eating habits that can stay with a person for life, so it is vital nurseries play a part in educating children on healthy eating.</p>
      <p>"It can be hard for parents who are often time-poor and I am as guilty as the next parent for slipping a bag of crisps or a cookie into my son's lunchbox.</p>
      <p>"I think it is fine to discourage parents from giving their children sugary and fatty food, but relationships between the nursery and parent may be put in jeopardy by a draconian approach."</p>
