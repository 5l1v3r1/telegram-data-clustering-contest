      <p>GREER, S.C. (AP) - A Kentucky woman is charged with making a bomb threat at a South Carolina airport.</p>
      <p>Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport Police arrested <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laura-snyder-jones/">Laura Snyder Jones</a> of Anchorage, Kentucky, on Saturday, charging her with a first-offense bomb threat.</p>
      <p>Airport spokesman Tom Tyra tells local news outlets that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laura-snyder-jones/">Jones</a> became frustrated with customer service. Tyra says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laura-snyder-jones/">Jones</a> told an American Airlines employee that she had a bomb in her bag when asked if she was carrying anything hazardous. Police were called and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laura-snyder-jones/">Jones</a> was taken to the Spartanburg County jail.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laura-snyder-jones/">Jones</a>‘ bags were screened by the Transportation Security Administration, but nothing dangerous was found.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/laura-snyder-jones/">Jones</a> was released Sunday. It’s unclear if she has a lawyer.</p>
