      <p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - Blood evidence in the car belonging to UFC heavyweight Walt Harris’ missing stepdaughter shows she suffered “a life-threatening injury,” police records show.</p>
      <p>An Auburn, Alabama, police charging document released after the arrest of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Ibraheem Yazeed</a> on Friday says a state lab determined the evidence matched <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Aniah Blanchard</a>, who was reported missing on Oct. 24, news outlets reported.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was last seen at a convenience store in Auburn while suspect <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Ibraheem Yazeed</a> was there. The charging document says a witness identified the 29-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Yazeed</a> as the man he saw force <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Blanchard</a> into a car. It’s unclear if that was her car, which was later found abandoned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Yazeed</a> was arrested Friday in Florida and charged with first-degree kidnapping. He waived his extradition hearing that same day.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Blanchard</a> has yet to be found.</p>

      <p>Auburn Police Chief Paul Register said it’s not clear if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aniah-blanchard/">Blanchard</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Yazeed</a> knew each other, though authorities don’t have any reason to believe they did. And he said authorities believe <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibraheem-yazeed/">Yazeed</a> didn’t act alone.</p>
