      <h1>Cook leads Vikings to 28-24 prime-time road win over Cowboys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">SCHUYLER DIXON</a></address>
      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Dalvin Cook did plenty in the running game.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> rushing leader from Minnesota might have had his biggest plays in the passing game while easily outshining two-time rushing champion Ezekiel Elliott.</p>
      <p>Cook ran for 97 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown on fourth down on the final play of the third quarter, and had 86 yards receiving that boosted three other scoring drives, leading the Vikings over the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Dallas Cowboys</a> 28-24 on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Cook’s 183 scrimmage yards gave him the league lead in that category as well at 1,415 as the Vikings (7-3) beat a winning team on the road for the first time in almost two years. Minnesota was 0-9-1 in its previous 10 such games.</p>
      <p>“Dalvin handled everything great,” coach Mike Zimmer said. “He played outstanding. Had some unbelievable runs, tough, competitive runs. I think Dalvin believes that he’s really good. I believe that too.”</p>

      <p>Amari Cooper had the most circus catches on a night full of them for both teams, including a toe-tapping TD for Dallas’ only lead in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Kirk Cousins threw for two touchdown passes, both to Kyle Rudolph, for just his second victory in nine prime-time road games.</p>
      <p>But Minnesota’s offensive star was Cook, who set up the first two Minnesota touchdowns for a 14-0 lead with catches of 27 and 29 yards on screens and got a first down with an 8-yarder early on the third scoring drive.</p>
      <p>“We thought it was going to be a challenge to get some explosive screens and get some explosive runs in this game to have a chance, and I think we checked those two boxes,” Cousins said. “That’s a big reason why we’re standing here with a win instead of a loss.”</p>

        <p>Elliott had 47 yards on 20 carries after three straight 100-yard games as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> (5-4) fell into a first-place tie with Philadelphia in the NFC East.</p>
        <p>“From the standpoint of numbers, from the standpoint of where you stand, this was a big game for us, and it’s going to make it that much harder to get where we want to go,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> owner Jerry Jones said.</p>
        <p>Despite throwing for 397 yards and three touchdowns, Prescott lost to Cousins for the first time after going 4-0 against the former Washington quarterback as a division rival.</p>
        <p>“We had to make them be one-dimensional,” Zimmer said. “I wish we had played better in pass defense than what we did. I thought we did a really good job with our run fits and the way that we tackled.”</p>
        <p>Cousins, who had 220 yards passing, beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> for the second time in eight tries as the Vikings kept pace in the NFC North, a game behind division-leading Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Trailing by four in the final two minutes, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> had a first down at the Minnesota 19 but insisted on continuing to force the ball to Elliott when the Vikings had made it clear they were stopping him first.</p>
        <p>Two runs netted minus-3 yards, and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> went to Elliott again on fourth down even though it was a pass. Linebacker Eric Kendricks broke up the sideline throw to Elliott, a dual threat like Cook but not on this night. He had two catches for 16 yards.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> got the ball back with 17 seconds left, but Jayron Kearse intercepted Prescott’s desperation pass from near midfield in the end zone.</p>
        <p>Dallas was down by four because of settling for a field goal and a 28-24 deficit after having a first down at the Minnesota 6. Another smothered run by Elliott was followed by two incompletions.</p>
        <p>RUDOLPH’S SCORING</p>
        <p>Rudolph started the night of circus catches with a one-handed grab in the back of the end zone and scored on another short TD toss.</p>
        <p>Then the tight end put Minnesota up 28-21 after Cook’s scoring run by winning a jump ball with cornerback Chidobe Awuzie. Rudolph’s 14 points were the most in 122 career games for the ninth-year player.</p>
        <p>CIRCUS TIME</p>
        <p>With the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> trailing 14-0, Cooper kick-started their first TD drive with a heel-dragging catch on third-and-12, followed two plays later by Michael Gallup’s 23-yard scoring grab.</p>
        <p>Then the player Dallas gave up a first-round pick for at midseason last year had two toe-dragging catches in a row, the second a 12-yard touchdown that put the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a> in front for the first time 21-20 in the third quarter. Cooper had 11 catches for 147 yards.</p>
        <p>Randall Cobb made a lunging catch in the end zone on a 22-yard touchdown catch to get Dallas even at 14.</p>
        <p>BLOWOUT ON GROUND</p>
        <p>While Cook outgained Elliott by 120 scrimmage yards, the Vikings finished with 153 yards rushing to just 50 for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a>. That’s about 100 yards below Dallas’ third-ranked rushing average.</p>
        <p>INJURIES</p>
        <p>Vikings: RG Josh Kline was ruled out with a concussion in the second half.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-cowboys/">Cowboys</a>: S Jeff Heath left with a shoulder injury in the first half.</p>
