        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mike Rowe, of “Dirty Jobs” television fame, sat down with “Fox &amp; Friends” hosts on Monday, Veteran’s Day, and told the watching, listening audience to take a memo — as much as the left likes to promote tolerance and diversity and snowflake madness for all, there is really no “safe space” in the military.</p>
      <p>Don’t cry, millennials.</p>
      <p>Mama’s got a hot buttered biscuit waiting for you in the basement.</p>
      <p>“Is there a greater meritocracy in the world? Is there a better example of true diversity? The thing that I’m most proud about when I go to bases, when I visit with people, they are utterly colorblind,” Rowe said, Fox News <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mike-rowe-veterans-day-fox-friends-military-safe-space">reported</a>. “There’s no conversation about ‘trigger words.’ There’s no safe space. The military is not a safe space.”</p>
      <p>Exactly.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>That’s how it has to be.</p>
      <p>After all, what enemy of America is going to allow for U.S. troops to take a timeout from battle for a mental health day?</p>
      <p>But what Rowe described — it wasn’t always this way.</p>
      <p>The military, under Barack Obama, was turned into a social justice experiment — a ground zero, of sorts, for safe spaces.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“In 2016,” The Washington Examiner <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/how-obama-era-social-engineering-transformed-the-military">wrote</a>, “Anthony Kurta, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for military personnel policy, announced, ‘There will be mixed genitalia in military bathrooms, showers and billeting.’”</p>
        <p>That was part of the Obama-inspired new policy to let transgenders have their way and use the facilities that most corresponded with the sex they picked for that day.</p>
        <p>What a legacy.</p>
        <p>“One of the things that I published in [my] book,” said James Hasson, a veteran who <a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2019/09/10/how-the-obama-administration-made-the-military-more-politically-correct/">spoke</a> with The Daily Signal about his book, “Stand Down: how Social Justice Warriors Are Sabotaging America’s Military” in September, “was a number of pictures of Safe Space signs outside instructor’s doors at the Naval Academy, both military and civilian. … And among other things, [people I interviewed] say that the instructors have taken a course called Trans 101, which is a sensitivity course put on by contractors from Google, but that played out across all the academies.”</p>
        <p>Academies like West Point, for example.</p>
        <p>“You don’t send people to West Point to become more ‘gender-cosmopolitan,’” Hasson said. “You send them to West Point so they can prepare to lead soldiers.”</p>
        <p>Right.</p>
        <p>Right, Obama?</p>
        <p>“The Obama era is over,” Military Times <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/2017/01/08/the-obama-era-is-over-here-s-how-the-military-rates-his-legacy/">wrote</a> in 2017. “Here’s how the military rates his legacy.” How’d he do?</p>
        <p>“More than half of troops surveyed in the latest Military Times/Institute for Veterans and Military Families poll said they ha[d] an unfavorable opinion of Obama and his two-terms leading the military,” Military Times reported. “About 36 percent said they approve[d] of his job as commander in chief.”</p>
        <p>Now look at President Donald Trump.</p>
        <p>“U.S. military veterans are largely supportive of the way Donald Trump is leading the nation’s armed forces,” Pew Research <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2019/07/10/trump-draws-stronger-support-from-veterans-than-from-the-public-on-leadership-of-u-s-military/">reported</a> in July.</p>
        <p>Night, meet day.</p>
        <p>From weak-kneed Obama to strong and bold Trump. Safe spaces, be gone. </p>
