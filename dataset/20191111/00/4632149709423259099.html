      <h1>Real-time bus data at airport soon</h1>

      <p><i>Public information boards to be installed at KIA to display running information; will display advertisements as well</i> <br/><br/>Passengers heading to the city from the airport will soon be able to check real-time running information of air-conditioned Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses. The corporation is working on a plan to install public information display systems at the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) for arriving passengers to view bus timings and status, much like they check flight information. <br/><br/>In 2016, BMTC installed around 200 public information boards at a number of Traffic and Transit Management Centres (TTMCs). However, BMTC has been facing issues to provide real-time data through its app for a while and the boards have also not been displaying bus information. Now as the BMTC app is in the process of getting updated with real-time information of buses, the same information will be displayed on these boards as well. <br/><br/><br/>A senior BMTC official said, “Our IT team has been working on providing real-time information. As soon as the app is updated, the boards will be updated with the same data. Currently we have 190-200 boards and our plan is to install these at the airport too so that the passengers know which bus to take and its timings.”</p>

      <p>–BMTC official<br/><br/>The public information boards will also fetch revenue for the corporation as advertisement will also be displayed on these boards. “The agencies that are providing the boards are also paying us for advertising on them. These information boards will display both real-time data and advertisements.” <br/><br/>BMTC also plans to display the information of all bus stops, including those on the bus priority lanes for ease of commute. However, as the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) maintains the bus stops, BMTC wants to work out a plan with BBMP and call tenders to install boards at all bus stops as well. During the recent public consultation held by BMTC at its chambers in Shanthinagar for the bus priority lanes, BMTC MD C Shikha announced that real-time information will be displayed at all bus stops on the bus priority lanes.</p>
