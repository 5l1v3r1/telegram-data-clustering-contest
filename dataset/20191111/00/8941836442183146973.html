      <h1>Mulvaney to file his own impeachment lawsuit, lawyers say</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> acting Chief of Staff <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mick Mulvaney</a> plans to file his own lawsuit over testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, withdrawing his bid to join a separate case filed last month by a former Trump adviser, his attorneys said Monday.</p>
      <p>The plans were revealed in a court filing that withdrew <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a>’s earlier request to become part of a suit by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Charles Kupperman</a>, the president’s former deputy national security adviser.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> had asked Friday evening to join that lawsuit, saying his case presented similar legal issues to that of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>. But they switched course following a conference call with a federal judge. They said they instead plan to file their own lawsuit asking a court to rule on whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> must follow a subpoena from Congress directing him to testify or an order from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> that he not appear.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> faced opposition from lawyers for both <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a> and House lawmakers in his bid to join the lawsuit, underscoring the lack of a unified approach from Trump administration officials in responding to the impeachment inquiry, which enters a critical public phase this week. Several people have testified in defiance of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> orders, while others have skipped their scheduled appearances.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>’s lawsuit aims to have a court decide on compliance with congressional subpoenas and to resolve conflicting directives from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> and Congress. He asked a judge to determine which branch of government should prevail.</p>

      <p>Like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> has defied a subpoena from impeachment investigators. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>’s subpoena has since been withdrawn. His lawyer also represents former national security adviser John Bolton, who did not appear for a scheduled interview last week and has not been subpoenaed.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> had said their arguments raised similar issues that belong in the Kupperman lawsuit, since they both have been close advisers to the president and in regular contact with him.</p>
      <p>But in a court filing Monday, Charles Cooper, who represents <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a> and Bolton, said there were important distinctions between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>’s situations, including that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> has already spoken publicly about issues central to the impeachment inquiry from the podium of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> briefing room.</p>
      <p>“Plaintiff, in contrast, has never publicly disclosed information relating to any of his official duties, including the matters under investigation by the House,” Cooper wrote of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>. The attorney said there was a “serious question” as to whether <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> waived the immunity protection with his public comments.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Cooper also suggested <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> both have arguments at their disposal that the other might not be able to exploit.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a>, for instance, still works for Trump, while <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a> does not. That means that even if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a> were to be directed to testify, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a>, as a current <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/white-house/">White House</a> employee, could nonetheless look to shield himself behind a Justice Department legal opinion that says close advisers to the president should not have their attention diverted “at the whim of congressional committees.”</p>
        <p>But Cooper also suggests his clients may have other, stronger arguments for immunity than <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a> since all their duties “concerned advising the President on highly sensitive matters of national security and foreign affairs.”</p>
        <p>House Democrats separately opposed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mick-mulvaney/">Mulvaney</a>’s effort to join the suit. They said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/charles-kupperman/">Kupperman</a>’s case is moot since the subpoena directing him to appear has been withdrawn.</p>
