      <p>Well, the time has finally come. Disney+ is here at last–or very nearly so.Disney’s streaming service promises to rock the industry’s boat, though I wouldn’t call it a death blow to rivals like Netflix and Amazon Prime.</p>
      <p>Rather, Disney+ will be a compelling new streaming option for families, <i>Star Wars </i>and MCU fans, and so competitively priced that you’ll be able to keep existing subscriptions while adding this one and not break the bank.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know about Disney Plus.</p>
      <h3>When Does It Launch?</h3>
      <p>Disney Plus launches first in the US, Canada and the Netherlands on November 12th, 2019. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/11/heres-the-exact-time-you-can-start-streaming-disney-plus/#55da2753459f">You can see the exact times the streaming service goes live right here</a>.</p>
      <p>The next rollout of Disney Plus takes place on November 19th, when it goes live in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
      <p>The third–and only other announced rollout–of the service takes place on March 31st, 2020 in the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain.</p>
      <p>Other regions will just have to wait, unfortunately.</p>
      <h3>How Much Does It Cost?</h3>
      <p>In the US, Disney+ will set you back $6.99/month or $69.99/year. It’s $8.99/month or $89.99 per year in Canada.</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that this subscription comes with some very nice perks. A subscription comes with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 simultaneous streams</li>
        <li>4K Ultra HD in Dolby Vision and HDR10</li>
        <li>Dolby Atmos support</li>
        <li>Downloadable content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This puts the service in-line with Netflix’s $16/month tier but at a much lower cost.</p>
      <p>It’s also cheaper than HBO or HBO Max, though a dollar more a month than Apple TV Plus.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there will be bundle deals available. For $12.99/month you can get Disney+, ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu. You’ll also be able to add Disney+ to existing Hulu subscriptions.</p>
      <h3>What TV shows, movies and other content will be available at launch?</h3>
      <p>The short answer: A whole bunch. Content ranges from Star Wars to Marvel, vaulted Disney classics to National Geographic. And now that Disney owns Fox, that means you’ll also see shows like <i>The Simpsons </i>and films like <i>Avatar </i>join the fray.</p>
      <p>This means you’ll be able to watch the animated <i>Beauty and the Beast, Avengers: Endgame, </i>the original <i>Star Wars </i>trilogy, old <i>Herbie </i>movies and tons more starting tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Disney is sparing no expense when it comes to original Disney Plus content. From across its catalogs and brands, you’ll see original films, TV shows, documentaries and much more. Here’s a sampling:</p>
      <h4>Star Wars</h4>
      <p>The <i>Star Wars </i>universe is getting its very first live-action TV show in <b><i>The Mandalorian, </i></b>starring Pedro Pascal (<i>Game of Thrones</i>) as a bounty hunter who looks an awful lot like Boba Fett. This show launches on day one and I will be reviewing it. Feast your eyes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmI7WKrAtqs">this glorious trailer</a>:</p>
      <p>The seventh season of <b><i>The Clone Wars </i></b>is also coming to Disney+. And, at some undisclosed future time, Ewan McGregor is reprising his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in an untitled series based on his character from the prologues that takes place between the events of those films and the original trilogy. Very exciting.</p>
      <p>An untitled <b>Cassian Andor</b> series has also been announced, and one suspects very strongly it will need to be a prequel to the events of <i>Rogue One.</i></p>
      <h4>Marvel</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Marvel is getting even more original content, all of which will weave directly into the wider fiction of the MCU alongside shows like <i>Marvel Agents of SHIELD.</i></p>
      <p><b><i>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </i></b>is a new six-episode show featuring the title characters Sam Wilson / Falcon and Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier. Reportedly lands in August of 2020.</p>
      <p><b><i>Hawkeye </i></b>continues the tradition of naming the show after the character and stars Jeremy Renner as the third-best fictional Hawkeye (after <i>The Last Of The Mohicans </i>and <i>MASH</i>). Renner reprises his role as Clint Barton in a post <i>Endgame </i>timeline.</p>
      <p><b><i>Loki </i></b>sees Tom Hiddleston return as the mischievous god in his very own series, and <b><i>WandaVision </i></b>will explore the relationship between Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Paul Bettany’s Vision, and will lead into the feature film <i>Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </i>in 2021.</p>
      <p>Other Marvel shows include <b><i>Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel </i></b>and <b><i>She-Hulk.</i></b></p>
      <h4>Other</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Pixar is getting its very own TV show on Disney+. <b><i>Monsters at Work </i></b>is a spinoff of the wonderful <i>Monster’s Inc. </i>though the story will focus on new monsters.</p>
      <p><b><i>High School Musical </i></b>is also getting a Disney+ series which releases at launch.</p>
      <p>On the non-fiction side of the aisle we have, at launch, both <b><i>Marvel</i>’<i>s Hero Project</i></b> and <b><i>The World According To Jeff Goldblum.</i></b></p>
      <p>Day one also sees the release of the live-action <b><i>Lady and the Tramp </i></b>feature film.</p>
      <p>There are many, many other Disney+ Originals in the works.</p>
      <h3>Release Schedule In November</h3>
