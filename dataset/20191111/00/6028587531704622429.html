      <p><b><i>Joker </i>could be the second-biggest live-action global grosser of all time, behind <i>Titanic</i> to not be a sequel, not be a remake and not get a sequel.</b>As of yesterday, <i>Joker </i>has earned $313.4 million (31.8%) in North America, $671.2 million overseas (68.2%) and $984.6 million worldwide. At this rate, it’ll probably pass $1 billion as soon as Friday, and it’ll end next weekend with around $1.014 billion worldwide, past <i>The Dark Knight </i>and as the biggest-grossing movie ever to never play in China. I cannot say whether Warner Bros., Joaquin Phoenix and Todd Phillips will keep their unofficial word to not make a sequel and keep Arthur Fleck out of the otherwise connected DC Films universe. If Cameron Monaghan can (successfully) portray “old man Joker” in the series finale of <i>Gotham</i>, then I guess (stupid speculation) Phoenix could show up as “old-man Joker” in <i>The Batman </i>if everyone desires it. Moreover, if <i>Joker </i>really doesn’t get a sequel, it could be the second-biggest live-action grosser of all time to not get a sequel (or not be a sequel).</p>
      <p>If you look at the 44 movies that have crossed/will cross $1 billion, right off the bat, 30 (<i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, <i>Jurassic World</i>, <i>Furious 7</i>, <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i>, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II</i>, <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i>, <i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</i>, <i>Incredibles 2</i>, <i>Fate of the Furious</i>, <i>Iron Man 3</i>, <i>Minions</i>, <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, <i>Spider-Man: Far from Home</i>, <i>Transformers: Dark of the Moon</i>, <i>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</i>, <i>Skyfall</i>, <i>Transformers: Age of Extinction</i>, <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>, <i>Toy Story 4</i>, <i>Toy Story 3</i>, <i>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest</i>, <i>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides</i>, <i>Despicable Me 3</i>, <i>Finding Dory</i>, <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</i> and <i>The Dark Knight</i>) are sequels or prequels. So, <i>Joker </i>is already somewhat unique in the $1 billion club.</p>
      <p>Of the other 14 movies, eight of them were franchise starters which either received sequels (<i>The Avengers</i>, <i>Frozen</i>, <i>Jurassic Park </i>and <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>) or have sequels coming down the pike (<i>Avatar, Black Panther 2, Aquaman 2 </i>and<i> Captain Marvel</i>). Yes, I’m presuming <i>Captain Marvel </i>will eventually get a conventional sequel, but that’s for another day. That leaves six anomalies. <i>Titanic</i>, <i>The Lion King</i>, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>, <i>Aladdin, Zootopia </i>and <i>Joker </i>are all “part one” installments with no planned part two on the docket. Disney could announce sequels to <i>Zootopia </i>and/or their live-action fairy tale hits, but I’d wager that <i>Zootopia </i>and <i>Aladdin </i>(because the cast was well-liked) are the only likely candidates for another go-around. But if <i>Joker </i>doesn’t get a sequel, it’ll be the second-biggest grosser, behind <i>Titanic</i>, that is a one-and-done and isn’t an animated film or a Disney live-action remake of a prior animated smash.</p>

      <p>Look, if we’re talking pure financials, the choice to green light a second film is a no-brainer. Presuming you keep the budget under $100 million, a sequel to the $62.5 million-budgeted <i>Joker </i>could make far, far less than its predecessor and still be hugely profitable. And, yes, I would argue that a theoretical <i>Joker 2 </i>would make a lot less than its predecessor, mostly because the first one was partially spurred by curiosity, relative uniqueness in the marketplace (it was the big grown up movie, the big franchise/comic book flick and the big scary movie in a season otherwise lacking in all three departments) and pre-release controversies not likely to be repeated. But, look, <i>Joker and the Big Balloon Adventure </i>could pull an <i>Alice Through the Looking Glass </i>(from $1.025 billion for <i>Alice in Wonderland </i>to $299 million for <i>Alice 2</i>) and still earn over/under $300 million worldwide.</p>
      <p>It may well be an example of a sequel like <i>It Chapter Two </i>($468 million versus $700 million for<i> It</i>) or <i>The Secret Life of Pets 2 </i>($429 million versus $875 million for <i>Pets 1</i>)<i> </i>which technically “disappoint” by earning about as much as we expected from the first over performing installment and yet still (due to $70-$80 million budgets) end up being quite profitable. Even a drop as sharp as <i>The LEGO Movie 2 </i>($191 million versus $469 million for <i>The LEGO Movie</i>) would still give <i>Joker </i>around $427 million. This isn’t <i>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</i> where the $170 million sequel to your $160 million predecessor grossed just $385 million five years after the first one earned $529 million (and two years after <i>Kong: Skull Island </i>earned $566 million on a $180 million budget). <i>Joker </i>was so cheap, and it earned so much, that even an otherwise catastrophic downturn would be just fine.</p>
      <p>That being said, Warner Bros. could decide that <i>Joker </i>should be just another one of their “one and done” stand-alone hits. As noted many times before, the Dream Factory had a killer 2018 slate, and most of their big hits (<i>Game Night</i>, <i>Ready Player One</i>, <i>Ocean’s 8, The Meg, Crazy Rich Asians, A Star Is Born</i>) were either intended to be one-and-done pictures or weren’t explicitly designed to kick off a new franchise. Yes, we’re still probably getting <i>Crazy China Girlfriend </i>and <i>The Meg </i>is based on a book with six literary sequels, but they weren’t intended to get audiences jazzed for the next one. Likewise, <i>Joker </i>may well be a one-and-done, where (like <i>Unbreakable</i>) the end of the origin story is the end of the story. Like <i>Unbreakable</i>, a sequel to <i>Joker </i>would struggle with fans wanting to see the very things (conventional superhero/supervillain showdowns) that, by their absence, made <i>Joker </i>stand out from the pack.</p>
      <p>When you have a $62.5 million comic book flick that is going to earn around $1.05 billion worldwide sans 3-D, without China and with an R-rating, there aren’t a lot of incorrect decisions in terms of how to proceed. If Warner Bros. gives us a <i>Joker </i>sequel, it could still “underperform” and be incredibly profitable. That’s presuming it doesn’t play like <i>Deadpool 2 </i>and earn less in North America and (thanks to a safe-for-China PG-13 version) earn more overseas for a larger global total, but I digress. Or Warner Bros. could leave well enough alone, which earns them goodwill and the benefit of the doubt for future “one off” DC Films flicks. Or, they could always toss the character into a different (but tonally appropriate) DC Films flick, which is essentially having your cake and eating it too. Who wouldn’t want to see Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman kick Arthur’s entitled, delusional ass?</p>
