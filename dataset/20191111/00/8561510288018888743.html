      <h1>Uber CEO Compares Self-Driving Car Crash to Murdering Journalists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Forgive And Forget</h3>
      <p>Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, humbly requests that we forgive and forget that one of his company’s self-driving cars <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uber-ceo-says-murder-of-journalist-by-saudi-government-1839766247">killed someone last year</a>.</p>
      <p>On Sunday’s episode of “Axios on HBO,” Khosrowshahi compared the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of the Saudi Arabian government to the pedestrian who was <a href="https://futurism.com/uber-autonomous-vehicles-pittsburgh">struck and killed</a> by one of his company’s self-driving cars, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/uber-ceo-says-murder-of-journalist-by-saudi-government-1839766247">according to <i>Gizmodo</i></a>. Bizarrely, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign investment fund happens to be a major investor in Uber, and the fund’s governor sits on Uber’s board.</p>
      <p>“I think the government said they made a mistake” by killing Khashoggi, Khosrowshahi said on the program. “It’s a serious mistake. We’ve made mistakes too. We stopped driving and we’re recovering from that mistake. I think that people make mistakes. It doesn’t mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they have taken it seriously.”</p>
      <h3>180 Noscope</h3>
      <p>After the episode ran, Khosrowshahi sent a <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-ceo-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-mistake-92865f2a-d97c-4d6a-b171-5e7c0a69e77a.html">statement to <i>Axios</i></a> completely reversing what he said, presumably because Uber’s press team heard his original comments and suffered a collective freakout.</p>
      <p>“I said something in the moment that I do not believe,” Khosrowshahi told <i>Axios </i>in the statement. “When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused.”</p>
      <h3>Grain Of Truth</h3>
      <p>That’s not to say Uber didn’t make mistakes.</p>
      <p>Reports recently surfaced that Uber never programmed its self-driving car AI <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/self-driving-uber-killed-woman-jaywalkers">to detect jaywalkers</a>, an oversight that likely contributed to the death of Elaine Herzberg, <a href="https://futurism.com/ubers-self-driving-car-decided-swerve">who was killed</a> by an experimental self-driving car last year.</p>
