      <h1>Desktop Linux 101: Reinstall Your Favorite Apps With This Easy Automated Solution</h1>

      <p>My job – and sheer curiosity – compels me to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/11/05/my-search-for-the-perfect-linux-os-just-ended--with-an-unexpected-surprise/#5be3b84a5cd6">distro hop a lot</a>. You know, endlessly trying out new desktop Linux distributions to see what’s new and shiny, and learn stuff along the way. But I found myself repeatedly installing the same set of software after each “nuke and pave.” Along the way I discovered a solution that saves bunch of time: writing a simple bash script!</p>

        <b>What’s A Bash Script?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Basically it’s a text file that contains a series of commands that you can run as a program. It’s a great way to automate things that would otherwise get pretty tedious.</p>
      <p>In my case, I have a ton of staple software I like to have (like Audacity, Kdenlive, Spotify, Discord, Telegram, Steam, OBS Studio) no matter what PC or Linux distribution I’m using. Sure, I could go to the software store and install them one by one, or batch install them in a Terminal windows, but let’s streamline the process!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>For this example I’ll be using <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/10/31/heres-why-blazing-fast-linux-os-peppermint-10-just-blew-me-away/#7d9a41596d9b">Peppermint 10</a>, a great all around distro based on Ubuntu LTS. So these instructions should work on any Ubuntu-based system.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Don’t want to read this guide? Watch my video tutorial instead:</i>
      </p>
      <p>First, let’s fire up our text editor. Just hit your Menu or Super key and type “gedit” or use your text editor of choice.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc927eae0af7b0006b108d3/960x0.jpg?cropX1=0&amp;cropX2=712&amp;cropY1=220&amp;cropY2=1080"/>
        <figcaption>Just run gedit or your favorite text editor<cite>Jason Evangelho</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Every bash script starts with this string: “<i>!#/bin/bash</i>.” The exclamation point and hash symbol is known in the UNIX world as a “she-bang” and is the foundation of pretty much any UNIX-based script.</p>
      <p>Now add a new line and use the hashtag symbol to “comment out” this line and add a description of what the script does.</p>
      <p>Now we’re going to enter some commands just like we’re using a Terminal.</p>
      <p>To install software in a terminal using Debian or Ubuntu-based distros, we use “sudo apt” and then the software package name.</p>
      <p>I’m also going to install “snapd”, which adds Canonical’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/02/20/canonical-is-planning-some-awesome-new-content-for-the-snap-store/#1825083320f8">Snap packages</a> to your system. If you’re using Ubuntu, you probably already have this pre-installed. Why Snaps though? Because I want the version of OBS Studio that packs in Nvidia’s NVEnc encoder so I can make these videos (it’s also available in the Flatpak version)!</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>4 lines to save yourself a lot of time when switching distros!<cite>Jason Evangelho</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>See that double ampersand (&amp;&amp;)? That tells the script to execute one command right after the other. It also tells the script to <i>stop</i> if something goes wrong. If you used a single ampersand, the script would continue even if the first command failed.</p>
      <p>We’re doing that because snap is a different kind of package manager than apt, and pulls software from difference a different source. Therefore we need to install those snap packages as a separate command.</p>
      <p>Next, all you have to do is save the file to a location of your choice. But before we run this script, we need to make it executable. Now back in the “old days” you had to do this in the terminal. But we’re living in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, so let’s just use the desktop like normal people! Right click your script, choose “Properties” go to the permissions tab, and check “allow executing file as a program.”</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/5dc928d6e0af7b0006b108d9/960x0.jpg?cropX1=622&amp;cropX2=1920&amp;cropY1=194&amp;cropY2=1080"/>
        <figcaption>To execute your script as a program, right click it, select "Properties," click the permissions tab ... [+] and check "Allow executing file as a program."<cite>Jason Evangelho</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And when you’re ready, simply right click the script, choose open and then “Run in terminal.” All you’ll have to do is enter your password and you’re off and running. All the apps in your script will be installed, <i>and</i> they’ll get updated automatically right along with your system updates. Nice!</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Some distributions may not give you the option to automatically run your script in the Terminal. If not, open up your Terminal app (or just search “Terminal” in the activities screen or menu). Browse to the location you saved it by entering cd (which means change directory) and the folder (in my case “Desktop”).</p>
      <p>To display a list of files in your current location, type “ls.”</p>
      <p>Then to execute your script, type “./myscript”</p>
      <p>Here’s a quick GIF to demonstrate:</p>

      <p>What you’ve seen here is a super basic bash script, but these building blocks can be expanded into something that can save you not just minutes, but hours.</p>

      <p>During my Fedora Challenge, I stumbled across <a href="https://git.furworks.de/tobias/fedora-install">this elegant bash script</a> by community member Tobias. It does a number of things to springboard you from a basic Fedora Workstation install to a system loaded up with goodies. It adds the free and (optionally) non-free <a href="https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration">RPM Fusion repos</a>, completely updates your system, and then installs an extensive and useful variety of software — including developer goodies, desktop themes and audio/video codecs.</p>
      <p>You can edit existing bash scripts like this to adapt to your own needs. Speaking of which, I need to get to work writing a few more of my own, because now I’m addicted to the automation!</p>
