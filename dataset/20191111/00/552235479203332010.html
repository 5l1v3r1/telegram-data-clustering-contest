      <h1>Queen of the South star reveals Ayr United winger said sorry for horror tackle</h1>
      <h2>Goal hero Gary Oliver was the victim of a nasty challenge from Luke McCowan during Saturday's Championship clash.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:02:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 00:02</time> by <a rel="author">Colin Paterson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/colin-paterson/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Oliver revealed Ayr bad boy Luke McCowan said sorry for the horror tackle he insisted could have broken his leg.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queen-of-the-south-fc">Queen of the South</a> forward was left in agony on the artificial turf after McCowan’s mistimed lunge with the game running away from the visitors.</p>
      <p>Referee Don Robertson immediately whipped out his red card with Oliver able to finish Saturday's game following treatment.</p>
      <p>Goals from Connor Murray and Oliver secured the Robert Burns derby bragging rights for Queens who had taken the lead through Kevin Holt before Michael Moffat equalised.</p>
      <p>And Oliver later admitted McCowan held his hands up for the X-rated challenge that came three minutes after he’d made it 3-1, as the Doonhamers celebrated a crucial fourth league win.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “I was lucky and it could have been a lot worse. It was a terrible tackle actually.</p>
      <p>“He caught me on my knee and it was probably a leg-breaker, probably the worst tackle I’ve been lucky with.</p>
      <p>“The boy has said sorry and it’s football, isn’t it? You need to just move on.”</p>
      <p>Oliver climbed off the bench in the eighth minute to replace the injured Jack Hamilton and got on the scoresheet after the break when he swept home Scott Mercer’s cutback.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s always a surprise when you’re getting ready to watch the game and then someone goes down but you need to be ready.</p>

      <p>“It’s hard to come on in a game, you’re not up to match speed. It feels like everything is going at 100mph but I settled in quite well.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t expecting Scott to cut it back, I don’t think he saw me but it was a great wee reverse pass, I hit it and it’s taken a wee nick before going through the goalie’s legs.”</p>
      <p>Queens have taken seven points from a possible nine at home against the top three of Dundee United, Ayr and Dundee but dodgy results elsewhere leave them seventh in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-championship">Championship.</a></p>
      <p>Oliver admitted gaffer Allan Johnston reminded his players of the need for more consistent form as they basked in the glory of south-west success.</p>
      <p>He added: “We were the better team and deserved to win.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Teams always struggle coming here so that’s a wee mental edge we’ve got while the bigger clubs are under a bit more pressure to win.</p>
      <p>“The gaffer said after the game when we play the smaller teams we’re picking up rubbish results. It’s consistency in this league. If you can go on a run you can be in that top three.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Ayr</a> midfielder Ross Docherty isn’t relishing the three-week break due to international call-ups and not entering the Scottish Cup until the fourth round.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old said: “When you have time off, it’s always easier when you’ve won your last game. You want to play again straight away when you lose.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be hard but we just need to get on with it.”</p>
