      <p>THE National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) remains confident that the country’s economy will expand faster in the last quarter of the year, but the numbers may fall short of the government’s target.</p>
      <p>Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia told reporters recently that his “fearless forecast” is for fourth-quarter GDP to increase by 6.5 percent to 7 percent.</p>
      <p>As GDP growth in January to September averaged 5.8 percent, Pernia said the economy must grow by 6.7 percent to hit the low-end target of the government’s target of 6 percent to 7 percent for the year.</p>
      <p>The biggest threat to the Philippine economy, he said, will come from outside of the country’s borders. “I think the trade tensions, the trade war between the United States and China is really the biggest risk not just for the Philippines but also for the whole global economy.”</p>
      <p>Domestic concerns, such as the outbreak of African swine fever (ASF), will not have a big impact on GDP, according to Pernia.</p>
      <p>National Statistician Dennis S. Mapa told reporters that while the ASF has spread to other regions, the poultry sector can take up the slack in the output of the livestock sector.</p>
      <p>The livestock sector is part of the major economic sector, Agriculture, Hunting, Forestry and Fishing. These are important aspects of GDP, which is a measure of production.</p>
      <p>Mapa said the outbreak of ASF will not significantly affect farm output in Region 4A (Calabarzon) and Region 3 (Central Luzon), which are regarded as the Philippines’s major livestock producers.</p>
      <p>“Livestock production in the third quarter slowed down but it is not yet in the negative territory. Hog production grew 1.7 percent. However, this is relatively slower compared to the previous quarter,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is likely that by the fourth quarter, hog production could contract. But other livestock industries will compensate. Chicken may grow by double-digit,” Mapa added.</p>
      <p>The holidays will boost poultry production as chicken meat is a favorite food item used in whipping up Filipino dishes served during special occasions. Mapa said the holidays could cause a spike in chicken and egg prices.</p>
      <p>Chicken and eggs were more expensive in recent weeks due to the outbreak of ASF as Filipinos consider these as alternative sources of protein. PSA data showed that in the National Capital Region, the average price of whole chicken rose by 14.9 percent year on year and 7.6 percent, month on month.</p>
      <p>Data showed egg prices have been on the rise since July when they increased  by 2.6 percent, 3.8 percent in August, 4.8 percent in September and 5.2 percent in October.</p>
      <p>The average price of pure beef went up by 4.6 percent year on year and by 0.7 percent on a monthly basis in October. Beef meat with bones was even more expensive as average price rose by an annualized rate of 6.2 percent.</p>
