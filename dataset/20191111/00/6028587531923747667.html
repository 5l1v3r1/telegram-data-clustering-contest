      <h1>Cloud File Services, File Publication, Kubernetes Data Protection And Silicon Root Of Trust</h1>

      <p>This piece is about some recent news from Nasuni, Kasten, FileShadow and Western Digital about interesting cloud file services, data protection for Kubernetes environments, file publication and creating a Silicon Root of Trust (RoT).Nasuni Corporation announced the newest release of its flagship file services platform for modernizing network attached storage (NAS) infrastructure. Nasuni’s new version gives enterprises access to artificial intelligence (AI) and search analytics for unstructured data, as well as cloud migration capabilities. According to the company, “Companies gain a springboard for agile, intelligent migrations and cloud-first approaches, as well multi-cloud flexibility.”  The image below shows details on Nasuni’s file services.</p>

      <p>Nasuni says that its new release includes enhancements in three main areas:</p>
      <p><b>Unstructured data intelligence</b>: The Nasuni Analytics Connector allows customers to turn unstructured data into big data. A consolidated cloud-based file system enables customers to export a temporary second copy of their file data to use with analytics software, AI, machine learning and other data recognition tools such as AWS Rekognition and Macie. This new release also features support for leading search software, including SharePoint Search, Acronis FilesConnect, Cloudtenna, Search Blox, Graymeta, and NeoFinder.</p>
      <p><b>Cloud migration</b>: Customers can more easily start their journey from traditional on-premises NAS to the cloud with the Nasuni AWS Cloud Migration Services and Nasuni Azure Cloud Migration Services. Nasuni’s services for AWS now include both Amazon Snowball and the Nasuni Cloud Migrator for AWS. Nasuni’s services for Azure now include Microsoft’s Data Box and Nasuni’s Cloud Migrator for Azure. These new services enable customers to seamlessly move data to Amazon S3 or Microsoft Azure storage faster and with less effort than a self-driven cloud migration, enabling a successful cloud-first strategy.</p>
      <p><b>Multi-cloud agility</b>: In addition to support for AWS and Azure, new support for Google Cloud Storage extends Nasuni’s public cloud storage capabilities to all three major public cloud providers, enabling customers to implement multi-cloud strategies based on their specific business or application requirements. This new release now supports more private cloud storage solutions, including NetApp StorageGRID, Nutanix Objects, IBM COS, Hitachi Vantara HCP, Scality RING, and many more.</p>
      <p>Kasten, a provider of cloud-native data management solutions, announced the general availability of Kasten K10 2.0. Purpose-built for Kubernetes, K10 provides enterprise operations teams with an easy-to-use, scalable and secure system for backup &amp; restore, disaster recovery and mobility of Kubernetes applications. The new release includes security features and greater ease-of-use for accelerated adoption of cloud-native applications.</p>
      <p>The K10 2.0 platform comes equipped with a Kubernetes-native API, auto-discovery of the application environment, policy-driven operations, straightforward multi-tenancy support, and advanced logging and monitoring, allowing teams to confidently operate their environments while supporting developers’ ability to use best-of-breed tools of their choice.</p>
      <p>FileShadow announces FileShadow Publish — a new feature that allows users to publish collections of files from their FileShadow cloud vault by generating shareable links. FileShadow Publish is a simple and secure way for teams, professionals and individuals to curate, store and share cloud content.</p>
      <p>With FileShadow Publish, users can share files with anyone, including people without FileShadow accounts, by sending a link to any FileShadow file, folder or collection. Users simply search, select and build the results into a collection that generates a unique shareable URL.  FileShadow Publish provides copyright protection to prevent unauthorized redistribution of users’ shared files. The content owner is in complete control of who views, downloads and edits shared collections.</p>
      <p>Western Digital Corp. announced that it has teamed up with lowRISC, Google and a coalition of partners in support of <a href="http://opentitan.org/">OpenTitan</a>, an open-source project building transparent, high-quality reference design and integration guidelines for silicon root of trust (RoT) chips that can be used in data storage, compute, and other hardware platforms.  The image below shows how OpenTitan differs from a traditional hardware root of trust (RoT).</p>
