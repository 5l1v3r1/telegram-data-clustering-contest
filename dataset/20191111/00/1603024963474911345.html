      <p>Essel Group will soon begin the sale of <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/media-entertainment/zeeentertainmententerprises/ZEE">Zee Entertainment </a>shares pledged with lenders, CNBC-TV18 reported quoting sources.</p>
      <p>The pledged shares of Zee Entertainment will be sold to institutional investors via block trades.</p>
      <p>Essel Group may, however, retain a 5 percent stake in the company to retain its promoter status and keep management control.</p>

      <p>Essel has reportedly hired JP Morgan and Citi to build the book for the sale of pledged shares.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, VTB and other mutual fund lenders are transferring the shares for sale to an escrow account.</p>
      <p>Zee Entertainment told CNBC-TV18 that it aims to seamlessly distribute the sale proceeds to all its lenders and to that end it has appointed credible investment bankers to lead the divestment process.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, news reports suggested that Essel Group Chairman Subhash Chandra may soon lose control of Zee Entertainment Enterprises as the company's lenders prepare to sell their pledged shares.</p>
