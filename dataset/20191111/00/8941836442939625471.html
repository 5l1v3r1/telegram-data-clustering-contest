      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - A Las Vegas attorney who pleaded guilty to a felony charge for allowing her clients to use cellphones while in jail has been disbarred from practicing law in Nevada.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nevada-supreme-court/">Nevada Supreme Court</a> on Friday issued a decision stating that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexis-plunkett/">Alexis Plunkett</a>’s misconduct hurt the legal system, her profession and her clients.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexis-plunkett/">Plunkett</a> in March pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of a telecommunication device by a prisoner as part of a plea agreement with prosecutors.</p>
      <p>The charge stems from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexis-plunkett/">Plunkett</a>’s jail visits to two former clients, including her then-boyfriend. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexis-plunkett/">Plunkett</a> said the cellphone was used to make calls regarding bail, which she believed she was authorized to do.</p>
      <p>She told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in an email that she is devastated by the Nevada high court’s decision and her “mistaken help” cost her a career and livelihood.</p>
