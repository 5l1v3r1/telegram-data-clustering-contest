      <h1>There Are Now Nine Countries Asking For An EU Aviation Carbon Tax</h1>

      <p>The Ministers of Finance of the Netherlands, Germany, France, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Bulgaria want a tax to neutralize the environmental damages of aviation.</p>

      <p>In a joint statement, they asked the European Commission to introduce a measure to offset CO2 emissions of planes.</p>
      <p>“We believe that more coordination on pricing of negative externalities of aviation could ensure that the polluter pays a fairer price for the use of aviation transport,” the statement says. “We therefore call upon the incoming European Commission to bring the debate on aviation pricing, e.g. in the form of aviation taxation or similar policies a step further, while taking into consideration existing effective national systems and policies, the competitiveness of the sector’s concerns, the geographical position and the development of the transport infrastructure in member states.”</p>

      <p>Although air travel is the source of around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, flying is considered underpriced in comparison with other forms of transportation. Among the EU Member States, only six levy taxes on international aviation in the form of ticket taxes for passengers departing from internal airports. The highest average tax rates are in the U.K., followed by Italy, Norway, Germany and France.</p>
      <p>“The initiative for a European aviation tax is a very welcome first step towards correcting this problem,” said Gilles Dufrasne, policy officer at international NGO Carbon Market Watch. “It has been estimated that a carbon price of 40-80$/tCO2e is needed today, and 50-100/tCO2e by 2030 to help us reach the Paris Agreement climate goals. However, it must also be noted that a carbon price alone is unlikely to set a sufficient incentive to decarbonize the aviation sector.”</p>
      <p>The Netherlands did not speak out a preferred form for the European aviation tax, but the government worked out a proposal for a national aviation tax. Companies can decide for themselves if they pass this on to their customers. Prior to this, the Netherlands imposed a similar tax in 2008, which was dropped a year later as passengers began using airports in Belgium and Germany instead.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the outcomes of the new proposal, the Netherlands is ready to move per 2021 on both freight and passengers.</p>
      <p>Dutch State Secretary Menno Snel said: “I am ambitious. It may be difficult to do this for an individual member state but doing it together we will ensure a level playing field and avoid carbon leakage. Also for the industry it's key that not every member state has a different taxation regime.” And added: “We expect the new European Commission to come up with proposals soon.”</p>
      <p>EU Commissioner Frans Timmermans, who is responsible for a European Green Deal and a European Climate Law, said he will get back on the matter “hopefully” by the December 20.</p>

      <p>At the ceremony for the call for a European aviation tax last week, he said he fully agrees the sector should be taxed the same way as any other kind of transport and that taking measures on a European level would be the best solution. “The Commission will look at several possibilities,” Timmermans said. “I am personally proponent of a kerosene tax: if you put petrol in your car, you pay taxes and, if you take a train, the train company has paid taxes for the energy they use, so why aren’t we taxing the energy we put on airplanes? It doesn’t make any sense.”</p>
      <p>A Commission spokesperson also said: “The option of new aviation taxes should not be looked at in isolation but alongside other policy measures, including emission trading, offsets, fuel and aircraft standards, and operational improvements.”</p>
      <p>Airlines, however, disagree.</p>
      <p>A Ryanair spokesperson commented: “This political statement is hypocritical and self-serving. In 2019 Ryanair will pay €630 million–over €4.20 per passenger–for environmental taxes in Europe. Many of these politicians are guilty of hypocrisy because they already operate environmental taxes on aviation in their own countries (Germany, France and the Netherlands), which exempts transfer passengers who cause the most environmental damage by taking two flights to reach their destination. Perhaps they should address their own environmental double standards before calling for more taxes on ordinary people and their families taking low fare point-to-point flights on low emission airlines for work, or to visit friends and family.”</p>
      <p>A Lufthansa spokesperson suggested other ways to avoid dangerous emissions, such as more investments in CO₂-neutral fuels: “Sustainability has been part of Lufthansa's DNA for 25 years. Our central task for the future is to make air traffic CO₂ poorer. For this to succeed, everyone must assume their responsibility. Politicians should flank the airlines' commitment with an appropriate set of rules that are as global as possible. The German answer to the question of climate protection in the future must be technology and innovation, not national bans or price increases.”</p>
      <p>A report from the independent research and consultancy organization CE Delft shows that tax exemptions for the aviation sector lead to higher passenger demand, aviation sector growth (in terms of both jobs and value added) and more flights.</p>

      <p>The report also shows that a tax could result in a 10% increase in average ticket price and an 11% decline in passenger demand, but, on the other hand, CO2 emissions would decrease by 11% and the number of people affected by airport noise by 8%.</p>

      <p>CE Delft concludes that “new or increased aviation taxes would generally have a negative impact on the aviation industry, but its impact on the overall employment within a Member State, on fiscal revenue and GDP would be close-to-zero” and that “new or increased taxes would reduce the number of passengers and flights as well as the environmental impacts.”</p>
