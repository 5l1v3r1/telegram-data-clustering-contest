      <h1>Harris returns home to become new Giants GM</h1>

      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - After playing a role in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Chicago Cubs</a>‘ transformation from rebuilding club to World Series champion, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Scott Harris</a> aims to guide the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">San Francisco Giants</a> along a similar path.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> was introduced Monday as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a>‘ new general manager, the first of what should be two significant hires for the franchise in the coming days.</p>
      <p>President of Baseball Operations Farhan Zaidi said he expects to announce a new manager sometime this week to succeed Bruce Bochy, who stepped down after the season. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a> have narrowed their list of candidates to former Phillies manager Gape Kapler, Astros bench coach Joe Espada and Rays bench coach Matt Quatraro.</p>
      <p>Zaidi and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> will work in tandem atop San Francisco’s front office, though Zaidi remains the primary decision-maker.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a>, 32, had served as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a>‘ assistant general manager since 2018 after five seasons spent as the team’s director of baseball operations. He contributed to a turnaround that saw the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a> go from a 101-loss team in 2012 to winning the World Series in 2016.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a> have finished at least eight games under .500 each of the past three seasons, but they’re optimistic about a promising farm system that can help them eventually turn the corner after a 77-85 season.</p>
      <p>“One thing I will say about my experience in Chicago is it can happen really fast,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> said. “I know it’s happened really fast in Farhan’s career, too, and that’s certainly the goal for us. We’re going to try to compete as much as possible on and off the field to put us in position to transform like we did in Chicago.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> grew up in Redwood City, just 27 miles south of San Francisco, in what he called a “split household.” His father, Rob, is from Chicago and a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a> fan who steered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Scott</a> to root for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a>‘ mother, Joanne, is a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a> fan and raised <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Scott</a>’s brother, Chris, to root for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a>.</p>
      <p>Zaidi shared how <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> gave his 2016 World Series ring, won with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a>, to his father.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>“Our goal’s going to be to get a ring for Mom now,” Zaidi said with a grin.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> broke in with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a>‘ front office at age 25, an extremely young hire with little front office experience. But he quickly impressed Chicago’s head of baseball operations, Theo Epstein, with his smarts and work ethic.</p>
        <p>As detailed in a story by The Athletic, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> spent one spring training taking a red-eye flight every Saturday from Phoenix to Chicago, where he was taking weekend business school classes at Northwestern, and returning on a Sunday red-eye to resume his <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a> duties.</p>
        <p>“As we got to know each other through this (interview) process, I was just really impressed with the person, the character, the creativity,” Zaidi said.</p>
        <p>As the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-cubs/">Cubs</a>‘ assistant GM, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> was involved with player development, and amateur and international scouting among other responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Zaidi, declining to go into detail on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a>‘ managerial search, said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> has had a chance to speak with all of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a>‘ remaining managerial candidates to offer his input.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> has an interesting prior link to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a>. Through his grandmother, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> struck up a friendship with Al Rosen, who served as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-giants/">Giants</a>‘ GM from 1985-92.</p>
        <p>He considered Rosen an adviser, and Rosen once helped <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> land an internship with the Washington Nationals.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-harris/">Harris</a> thanked his family for their “relentless pursuit to get me back to the Bay Area,” and he expressed how grateful he was to land his new position so close to home.</p>
        <p>“It’s such a privilege to be here, a privilege to come back home,” he said. “It’s a privilege to work with such a flagship organization with such a passionate and deserving fan base.”</p>
