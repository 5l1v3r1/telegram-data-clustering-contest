      <p>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Although <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">Connor McDavid</a> makes amazing goals look routine, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Edmonton Oilers</a>‘ star had a big milestone night on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The All-Star center had a hat trick and became the eighth NHL player to record 400 points before his 23rd birthday in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a>‘ 6-2 win over the Anaheim Ducks.</p>
      <p>It was the fifth hat trick of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a>’s career and his first since Feb. 18, 2018, against Colorado. He also became the 13th player in league history to reach 400 points in 306 or fewer games.</p>
      <p>“It’s good. It helps when you get a win as well,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a>, who is tied for second in the league in scoring with 30 points (11 goals, 19 assists). “It’s good to shoot a couple and they were able to go in the net.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a> was one of five <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> to have a multi-point night. Leon Draisaitl had four assists to move into the NHL scoring lead with 34 points (14 goals, 20 assists).</p>

      <p>Ryan Nugent-Hopkins also scored twice for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a>, who have won four of their last six. Zack Kassian had a goal and two assists and Oscar Klefbom had a pair of assists</p>
      <p>“Tonight we were solid all the way through and capitalized on opportunities,” coach Dave Tippett said.</p>
      <p>Mikko Koskinen made 31 saves for his seventh win in 10 games. Four of the saves came when Edmonton was short handed as it killed off all five Anaheim power-play opportunities.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> were 2 for 5 on the power play.</p>

        <p>“Offense is something that hasn’t come easy to us as a group, but it is starting to pick up,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a> said. “I thought the penalty killing made the difference tonight.”</p>
        <p>Rickard Rakell and Max Jones scored for Anaheim and John Gibson stopped 25 shots. The six goals Gibson allowed tied a career-worst.</p>
        <p>“We said they were an opportunistic team. They were. We said they were good on the power play. They were. We got outplayed,” Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a> reached the 400-point milestone with 9:06 remaining in the first period when his wrist shot beat Gibson to give the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> a 2-1 lead.</p>
        <p>His second goal ended up being highlight worthy as he eluded Anaheim’s Jakob Silfverberg, momentarily lost his balanced and then deked Gibson to put a wrist shot past his stick side.</p>
        <p>“Coming out of the zone, I tried to put a play on the net. I’m always looking for the pass, probably too much,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a> said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/connor-mcdavid/">McDavid</a> then completed the hat trick with his fourth power-play goal of the season with 6:35 remaining. The fans then pelted the Honda Center ice with hats that they received as part of a Veterans Day giveaway.</p>
        <p>Nugent-Hopkins notched the 17th multi-goal game after coming in with only one goal. He put the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/edmonton-oilers/">Oilers</a> on the board 88 seconds into the game when he took advantage of a turnover behind the Anaheim net and jammed it past Gibson’s short side. Edmonton’s James Neal pressured Anaheim’s Korbinian Holzer to turn it over, allowing Nugent-Hopkins to take advantage for his second goal of the season.</p>
        <p>He then added a power-play goal at 7:45 of the second period with a snap shot the found the upper left corner of the net.</p>
        <p>Rakell tied it at one when he was able when he lifted a backhand over Koskinen’s shoulder for his fifth of the year. Jakob Silfverberg was able to gain possession behind the net and fed it to a wide-open Rakell, who was playing in his 400th NHL game.</p>
        <p>Steel got his first goal of the season early in the third with a wrist shot that beat Kosskinen on his stick side.</p>
        <p>NOTES: Anaheim placed D Hampus Lindholm on injured reserve due to a lower-body injury. Lindholm, who leads the Ducks in assists with nine, missed two games last month due to the same injury. … Rakell is the 16th player in Anaheim franchise history to appear in 400 games. … C Sam Steel assisted on Jones’ goal and has four assists in the last three games.</p>
