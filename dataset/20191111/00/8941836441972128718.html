      <p>DARIEN, Conn. (AP) - A Connecticut man charged in the death of a hotel worker he says attacked his family in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/anguilla/">Anguilla</a> has declined to return to the British Caribbean territory for the latest pretrial hearing, a spokesman said Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Scott Hapgood</a>, of Darien, is worried about his safety in light of death threats, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/anguilla/">Anguilla</a> officials have not provided assurances that he would be allowed to return home on bond after the hearing, family spokesman Jamie Diaferia said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/anguilla/">Anguilla</a> officials rejected an offer for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a> to appear by video link for Monday’s hearing, Diaferia said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a> and his family say a hotel worker, Kenny Mitchel, of Dominica, showed up at their room unannounced during their April vacation and demanded money, then attacked them. After the struggle, Mitchel died, and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a> was charged with manslaughter.</p>
      <p>An autopsy report showed Mitchel died of positional asphyxia and received blunt force injuries to his torso and other areas. Diaferia said that a toxicology report was suppressed and that Mitchel was found to have drugs, including cocaine, in his system.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a> appeared at previous hearings and had been released on $74,000 bond.</p>
      <p>The case has sparked racial tensions on an island that caters to wealthy tourists.</p>
      <p>“We understand there will be people in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/anguilla/">Anguilla</a> who say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Scott</a> is running from a trial. That is 100 percent false,” said Juliya Arbisman, an attorney for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a>.</p>
      <p>At a rally last month in Darien, supporters including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal called on <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/anguilla/">Anguilla</a> officials to provide assurances that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a> would be kept safe and allowed to remain free on bond.</p>

        <p>President Donald Trump also tweeted last month he would “be looking into” the case. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/scott-hapgood/">Hapgood</a>’s wife had appeared on “Fox &amp; Friends” and urged Trump to intervene.</p>
