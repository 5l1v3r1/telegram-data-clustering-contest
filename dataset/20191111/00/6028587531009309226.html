      <p><b>Topline: </b>As President Trump has appeared at Monday’s Veterans Day parade and at recent sporting events, he’s also ventured outside the Washington and Mar-a-Lago bubbles that limit his exposure to both public <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-veterans-day-parade-speech-watch-live-stream-as-the-president-speaks-in-new-york-city-today-2010-11-11/">protests</a> and⁠—besides his rallies⁠—<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/politics/trump-alabama-lsu-football-game/index.html">support</a> of his presidency, which is imperiled by the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>With his Monday speech,Trump became the first sitting president to kick off a Veterans Day parade, but according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/donald-trump-veterans-day-new-york-city/index.html?utm_content=2019-11-11T16%3A39%3A23&amp;utm_source=twCNNp&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=image">CNN</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-veterans-day-parade-speech-watch-live-stream-as-the-president-speaks-in-new-york-city-today-2010-11-11/">CBS News</a>, chants of “Lock him up” and “Traitor” could be heard throughout.</li>
        <li>Previously, multiple reports said Trump was <a href="https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a29677422/trump-booed-ufc-msg/">booed</a> at a November 2 UFC fight at New York’s Madison Square Garden, which Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1191033582053052416?s=20">called</a> “fake news.”</li>
        <li>During an October 27 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/isabeltogoh/2019/10/28/president-trump-faces-lock-him-up-chants-at-world-series-baseball-game/#2e2b94c21926">World Series game</a> in Washington, Trump was booed when he was shown on the Jumbotron between innings.</li>
        <li>Trump was, however, met with resounding <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/politics/trump-alabama-lsu-football-game/index.html">cheers</a> at a Saturday college football game in Alabama, with the crowd chanting “USA!” and “Trump 2020.”</li>
        <li><i>Forbes</i>’ own chief content officer, Randall Lane, was with Trump <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/randalllane/2019/11/03/this-is-what-donald-trump-actually-hears-when-he-gets-booed/#2c9aea0a4aaf">four years ago</a> on the balcony of his Manhattan tower as he waved to the crowds on the street below (who were waiting to catch a glimpse of Pope Francis during his first U.S. visit.)</li>
        <li>Trump was met with “a smattering of applause,” while “the boos overwhelmed,” Lane wrote, while the then-future president called the crowd’s reaction “90% positive.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Despite his professed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/donald-trump-veterans-day-new-york-city/index.html?utm_content=2019-11-11T16%3A39%3A23&amp;utm_source=twCNNp&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=image">support</a> for the “United States Armed Forces, the greatest warriors to ever walk the face of the earth,” Trump has long been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/10/18/i-earned-my-spurs-battlefield-mattis-jabbed-trump-critics-say-he-hasnt-gone-far-enough/">criticized</a> for his own lack of service. He infamously avoided the draft during the Vietnam War with a medical deferment for bone spurs. (According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/donald-trump-draft-record.html?module=inline"><i>New York Times</i></a>, Trump received four additional draft deferments for education.) </p>
      <p><b>Chief critics: </b>Charlotte Clymer, an Army veteran and press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, <a href="https://twitter.com/cmclymer/status/1193838328354889728?s=20">pointed out</a> Trump’s history of attacking service members and veterans, while Navy veteran and media commentator Naveed Jamali <a href="https://twitter.com/NaveedAJamali/status/1192101427922866183?s=20">questioned</a> his Veterans Day motives, saying he only sees the military “as a prop.”</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> If Trump comments about the public’s reception to him, since he’s called previous reports false. And the president’s sons. Beyond Veterans Day, there’s been debate over whether boos or cheers were more prevalent during Trump’s recent appearances. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. came to their father’s defense after the reports of boos at the UFC fight, with the former calling it <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1190833738676129792">“bulls—t,”</a> and the latter accusing reporters of being <a href="https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1190861163929784321">“dishonest people.”</a></p>
