      <p>Pop star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/charli-xcx">Charli XCX</a> has set pulses racing in incredibly saucy snaps posing in sheer lingerie for Agent Provocateur's Christmas campaign.</p>
      <p>The songstress, 27, showed off her tiny display and toned tum in revealing pictures for the lingerie brand.</p>
      <p>She was saddled up on a horse, leaving almost nothing to the imagination.</p>
      <p>Charli - real name Charlotte - was pictured in several different lingerie sets in the jaw-dropping shoot.</p>
      <p>In one snap, she's seen grabbing onto a cowboy hat while sitting on the horse, showing off her assets in a lace pink underwear set.</p>
      <p>While in another she's spotted in a sexy red set paired with stockings.</p>
      <p>She's not one to shy away from the camera - last night the star shared a sizzling swimsuit selfie to her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> page.</p>

      <p>Charli is known to show off her stunning physique and she was back to her old tricks once again.</p>
      <p>She rose to fame in 2013 with her chart-topping hit I Love It and the singer hasn't been afraid to express her larger-than-life persona through both her music and style.</p>

      <p>Amid her busy work schedule, the star revealed she and Australian songwriter <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/troye-sivan">Troye Sivan</a> used to enjoy some downtime by throwing huge house parties in LA.</p>
      <p>On her wild days, the pop star told <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/">Dazed</a>: "We went through this phase of just throwing like a f**k-load of parties.</p>
      <p>"We would just leave the doors open, send out the biggest group texts, and so many people came. Like, the police would come, it was a real nightmare. Our neighbours hated us. All our cars got keyed."</p>
