      <h1>3 Things To Know About OPEC’s Latest Oil Forecast</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jude Clemente</a></address>
      <p>OPEC’s annual<i> </i><a href="https://woo.opec.org/index.php"><i>World Oil Outlook 2019</i></a> came out this past week and as usual offers some keen insight into the global oil market. Let me make some key points on it.</p>
      <p>Oil leads and accounts for 35% of global energy supply, and OPEC supplies 35% of the world’s oil.</p>
      <p>After some hesitation, OPEC’s annual outlook has become more bullish on U.S. shale oil production.</p>
      <p>In fact, OPEC now expects that the U.S. shale boom will continue, and our light tight oil will easily be adding the majority of new production over the next five years - the main bearish factor for pricing.</p>
      <p>Even from 2019-2030, U.S. tight oil output will balloon by another 5.3 million b/d to nearly 17.5 million b/d.</p>
      <p>And a great article this past week from NYT also warned market bulls about Canada, Brazil, Norway, and Guyana.</p>
      <p>A “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/business/energy-environment/oil-supply.html">flood of oil is coming</a>” from these four that will add an additional ~2 million b/d of supply in 2020 and 2021, perhaps enough to totally cover new global demand.</p>
      <p>No wonder then that OPEC is feeling the pressure to not just extend its 1.2 million b/d production cut deal beyond March 2020, but to actually deepen it.</p>

      <p>We all know about the ongoing importance for oil in transportation, about as irreplaceable a fuel as we have.</p>
      <p>Road transport accounts for about 45% of the world’s oil demand and lacks a significant substitute.</p>
      <p>Electric cars simply aren’t realistic: the average Tesla buyer, for instance, has a household income of $400,000 per year - more than six times the national average.</p>
      <p>Indeed, some 90 million oil cars are sold globally per year.</p>
      <p>Just look around you, here in the U.S., where oil powers some 97% of transportation.</p>
      <p>At ~9.6 million b/d, U.S. gasoline usage remains <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MGFUPUS2&amp;f=A">higher than ever</a>.</p>
      <p>But it’s really petrochemicals that will quietly maintain “the oil age” for a lot longer than many are telling you.</p>
      <p>Often ignored, not just inherent to renewable energy manufacturing and development, oil is integral to literally <a href="https://www.ranken-energy.com/index.php/products-made-from-petroleum/">over 6,000 </a>products that we humans rely on everyday.</p>
      <p>Road transport and petrochemicals explain why OPEC estimates that a $10.6 trillion investment is required in the global oil upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors over the next 20 years to meet non-stop rising demand.</p>

      <p>Americans still consume four times more oil than Chinese and 18 times more than Indians.</p>
      <p>As such, the growth opportunities for oil usage in China and India are immense.</p>
      <p>These two have accounted for 55% of new oil demand since 2010 alone.</p>
      <p>China’s “down years” are when 26 million oil cars are bought.</p>
      <p>India’s oil demand is expected to double over the next two decades.</p>
      <p>Looking forward, China and India will combine to add ~9-10 million b/d of incremental oil demand over the next 20 years, compensating for any potential consumption declines in the developed OECD nations.</p>
