      <h3>Time Out Says</h3>
      <p>The whimsical interiors, endless Instagram selfie opportunities and brand-new kids’ menu make Tania’s Teahouse a dreamy destination for the whole <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/kids">family</a>.<br/><br/>The pink door, framed by blush-coloured roses, is a clear indicator of what’s to come before we even step inside (which we do after a few doorstep pictures for the gram).<br/><br/>Step into a space that wouldn’t look out of place in the pages of a fairy tale picture book. It’s as though a unicorn has waved her horn and created a magical café in a two-storey villa in <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/jumeirah">Jumeirah</a>.<br/><br/>But Tania’s Teahouse isn’t just pleasing on the eye, the food is an assault on the taste buds – in a good way too – and the staff clearly feed off the happy vibes of the eatery. The beautifully illustrated menu offers a selection of breakfast and lunch dishes as well as two afternoon tea options.<br/><br/>With fun names like “Save The Pesto For Lasto” and “Let’s <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/420968-zoco-dubai-now-offers-tacos-for-dhs10-every-tuesday">Taco</a> ‘Bout It” there’s plenty of fun involved in choosing what to eat.<br/>The presentation of the food is as Instagrammable as the décor, and so pretty are the dishes that there is even a warning on the menu advising social media-lovers not to take too long over their snaps before the food gets cold and is no longer so tasty.<br/>This little teahouse is worth a visit, it’s cute pretty and to quote Mary Poppins, “practically perfect in every way” (if pink is your vibe).<br/><br/><b>WHAT IS IT...</b><br/>A thoroughly Instagrammable coffee shop<br/><br/><b>WHY GO...</b><br/>For a hint of twee. And if you have wannabe little Princesses in your tribe</p>
