      <p>The government may extend existing anti-dumping duty on imports of a Chinese chemical used in pharmaceuticals industry as the commerce ministry insisted on continuation of the levy.</p>
      <p>The continuation of the duty on imports of 'Sodium Nitrite' from China was recommended by the ministry's investigation arm Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) after concluding a probe into it.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/chemicals/deepaknitrite/DN">Deepak Nitrite Ltd</a> had earlier filed an application before the directorate for initiating sunset review of the anti-dumping duty on the imports of the chemical from China. It had requested for extension of anti-dumping duties on the imports.</p>

      <p>"The authority recommended that revised anti-dumping duties be continued to be imposed from the date of issue of notification by the central government on imports of Sodium Nitrite," the DGTR said in a notification.</p>
      <p>The DGTR has recommended $79.58 per tonne duty on the imports.</p>
      <p>Countries carry out anti-dumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in cheap imports.</p>
      <p>As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of the World Trade Organization.</p>
      <p>The duty is aimed at ensuring fair trade practices and creating a level-playing field for domestic producers with regard to foreign producers and exporters.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
