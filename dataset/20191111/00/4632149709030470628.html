      <p><b>Every picture tells a story </b><br/>Artist George Martin’s new show So Far... So Good is inspired from the classic, satirical expression, which we use to pause and gauge our performance in the absurd theatre of life, where we put up an act of ‘being’ and ‘existing’. In all these artworks, some sort of conversation is happening through the images, illusions, forms, colours, flatness, symbolisms, pastiche and visual textures. <br/><br/>WHERE: Gallery Sumukha, BTS Depot Road, Wilson Garden <br/>WHEN: 10.30am-6.30pm, till November 30 <br/>CALL: 22292230 <br/><br/><b>Colour me happy</b> <br/>Confluence has brought together the recent works of Priya Bharat, Shipra Gupta, and Sucharita Senapati. Sucharita’s style is realism and she loves to work with watercolour, oil, and charcoal, and she is currently experimenting with textures and ink. She’s made a series on Ganesha, Shiva, elephants and fairies. Bharat’s subjects are varied – landscape, cityscape, still life, each drawn from observations of everyday life. Gupta’s paintings are characterised by nostalgic images of childhood and joys of the simple, rural life. <br/><br/>WHERE: Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath<br/>WHEN: 10.30am-7pm, till November 12 <br/><br/><b>Shoe talk </b><br/>Comic Aakash Mehta is in town with his act Dirty stans and other stories.

Drop by and find out yourself. <br/><br/>WHERE: That Comedy Club, 5th Block, Koramangala <br/>WHEN: 9.45pm, November 11 <br/><br/>Jokes apart <br/>Mondays are heavy to deal with. We know it.

It is a comic tale of a peace-loving kingdom on the planet Venus, ruled by an absent-minded king and a very patient queen, and their assistant – a military chief, who is preoccupied with making a magic potion.
