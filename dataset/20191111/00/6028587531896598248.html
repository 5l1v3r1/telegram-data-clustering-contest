      <p><b><i>(Updated: 11/13 at 12:39 p.m. PST)</i></b><b>Topline</b>: Former Democratic Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick has told allies and party insiders that he is running for president, according to multiple reports, making him the first candidate with reservations about the current crop of candidates to launch a late campaign less than three months away from the Iowa caucuses.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Patrick is a close ally of Barack Obama and was the first black governor in Massachusetts when he was elected in 2006, succeeding Mitt Romney. </li>
        <li>After two terms as governor, Patrick started working as a managing director at investment firm Bain Capital.</li>
        <li>Patrick ruled out running for president last year but has since reconsidered because he doesn’t think any of the current candidates have enough momentum.</li>
        <li>Patrick also thinks he can unite progressive and moderate Democrats across racial, economic and generation lines, the <i>New York Times</i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/deval-patrick-2020.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share">reported</a>.</li>
        <li>He is expected to launch his campaign before the end of this week in order to submit paperwork to appear on the primary ballot in New Hampshire, where the filing deadline is Friday, according to the <i>New York Times</i>.</li>
        <li>Patrick has already missed the filing deadline to appear on the primary ballot in Alabama and Arkansas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg is also flirting with the idea of a presidential bid, citing concerns that progressive candidates Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would not fair well in a general election. He has filed the necessary paperwork in Alabama and Arkansas, but has not made a final decision on whether to run yet.</p>
