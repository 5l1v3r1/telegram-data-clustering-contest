      <h1>Make it 2 in a row - takeaways help Dolphins’ turnaround</h1>

      <p>DAVIE, Fla. (AP) - The biggest takeaway from the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Miami Dolphins</a>‘ wins the past two weeks: Takeaways matter.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> had by far the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s worst turnover differential two weeks ago, when they were 0-7. But they’ve been on the plus side each of the past two games, and now can bask in the league’s most improbable winning streak.</p>
      <p>Three interceptions Sunday helped <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> rally on the road to upset Indianapolis, 16-12. Yes, the picks came against Brian Hoyer, but they were still impressive considering the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> totaled one interception in their first seven games.</p>
      <p>“Emotionally it does something to you,” coach Brian Flores said Monday. “Basically, if you get a turnover, you’re closer to winning the game. If you turn the ball over, you’re closer to losing the game. Hopefully we get more of them.”</p>
      <p>To the distress of many <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> fans, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> hurt their chances of landing the No. 1 pick in next year’s draft. But Flores doesn’t want to wait to create a winning culture in his first season.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>“Culture is something you build over time,” he said. “It’s early, but I do think we’re moving in the right direction.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> will try to make it three wins in a row Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> are six-point underdogs at home, but they were underdogs the past two weeks as well.</p>
      <p>WHAT’S WORKING</p>
      <p>As the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> trend toward mediocrity, the most dramatic improvement has been on defense, with takeaways only part of the story.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>A month into the season, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> ranked last in the league in points allowed (41 per game) and yards allowed (472). They were on pace to set league records in both categories.</p>
        <p>In the past five weeks, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> ranks 15th in scoring defense (21) and 14th in yards allowed (326).</p>
        <p>It’s a unit stripped of veteran talent by the franchise’s rebuilding project and more recently depleted by injuries.</p>
        <p>“A lot of ups and downs, but this team is really growing,” safety Steven Parker said. “I love that.”</p>
        <p>WHAT NEEDS HELP</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> netted 229 yards, their lowest total since September, and the ground game remains the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s worst.</p>
        <p>Kalen Ballage had a career-high 20 carries at Indy but totaled just 43 yards, and he’s averaging 2.1 yards per carry this year.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> have reached the 100-yard rushing mark only once this season, and they’re on pace to set teams records for the fewest yards rushing and lowest per-carry average.</p>
        <p>STOCK UP</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> went into Sunday’s game without the three best defensive backs on their Week 1 roster, but several young replacements have emerged as potential keepers. Parker, a waiver acquisition after spending last year on the Rams’ practice squad, and undrafted rookie Nik Needham each had an interception and played well.</p>
        <p>“It just felt good to contribute to the old guys,” Needham said.</p>
        <p>STOCK DOWN</p>
        <p>For the second week in a row, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>’s chances of landing a franchise quarterback in 2020 took a hit.</p>
        <p>Team owner Stephen Ross attended Saturday’s showdown between Alabama’s Tua Tagovailoa and Louisiana State’s Joe Burrow, but the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> might not get a shot at either.</p>
        <p>“It’s not something I really think about,” Flores said. “I think about this team. My job is to put this team in the best position to try to win games.”</p>
        <p>The Bengals (0-9) are now front-runners for the No. 1 pick. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> is one of four teams with two wins.</p>
        <p>INJURIES</p>
        <p>Linebacker Jerome Baker briefly came out of the game with a knee injury but returned and isn’t expected to miss practice time.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was annoyed that he was belatedly summoned for a mandatory concussion test in the fourth quarter. As a result, he missed three plays when the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> were threatening, and they settled for a field goal.</p>
        <p>The hit that raised concerns had occurred during <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>’s previous possession. Fitzpatrick said he could have been examined while the Colts had the ball.</p>
        <p>“There was a five-minute gap where I was sitting there doing nothing and they didn’t need me on the field, where I could have been checked,” Fitzpatrick said. “The timing of it was off, and that was difficult for me to understand.”</p>
        <p>KEY NUMBER</p>
        <p>Minus 12 - the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a>‘ scoring differential in the past five games. In the first four games it was minus 137.</p>
        <p>NEXT STEPS</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> have a chance to show how much they’ve improved when they face the Bills. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> gave up 22 points in the fourth quarter in Week 7 and lost at Buffalo, 31-21.</p>
