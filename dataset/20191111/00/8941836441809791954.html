      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - LSU coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-orgeron/">Ed Orgeron</a> says his boisterous and sometimes profane locker room speech after the top-ranked Tigers beat Alabama was not meant for public consumption and not meant to hurt anyone.</p>
      <p>An unidentified LSU player posted about 14 seconds of the speech on social media after Saturday night’s 46-41 victory in Tuscaloosa. A rowdy <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-orgeron/">Orgeron</a> can be heard yelling that LSU is going to beat Alabama in recruiting and “every time they see us.” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-orgeron/">Orgeron</a> also uses an expletive to mock Alabama’s “Roll Tide” rallying cry.</p>
      <p>“The things that I say outside, to the media, those are things I want to get out, and if I wanted that to get out, I would have said that outside,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-orgeron/">Orgeron</a> said Monday when asked about the social media post. “You get emotional. You talk to your team - it’s your family. Just like we all talk to our family.</p>
      <p>“We talk around the dinner table and say some things that outside the family we don’t say. It was no means to hurt anybody - nothing like that. It was just a fiery moment, a very emotional moment. I think that’s all that was.”</p>
      <p>The social media post has been taken down and LSU declined to identify the player.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ed-orgeron/">Orgeron</a> said he spoke to the player who broadcast that portion of the locker room celebration and that the player “felt bad.”</p>
      <p>The victory gave unbeaten LSU (9-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) an inside track to the SEC championship game and potential College Football Playoff berth. The Tigers play next on Saturday night at Mississippi (4-6, 2-4) in a game nicknamed the Magnolia Bowl.</p>
