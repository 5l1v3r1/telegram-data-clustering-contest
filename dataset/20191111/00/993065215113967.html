      <p>George Michael’s sister has hit back at Sir Elton John’s claims that the late star was uncomfortable with his sexuality.</p>
      <p>The singer died at the age of 53 on Christmas Day 2016.</p>
      <p>Sir Elton, 72, recently said the ex Wham! star “was so uncomfortable in his skin about being gay even though he said he wasn’t”.</p>

      <p>The Rocket Man singer also told US show The Talk that Michael “didn’t want to be here”, as he claimed he had tried to help him overcome his addictions.</p>
      <p>But Melanie Panayiotou told The Big Issue magazine that the Careless Whisper singer was “my ‘very proud to be gay’ brother, contrary to what you may have read recently”.</p>
      <p>Sir Elton and Michael both sang on the hit Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me.</p>

      <p>Michael suffered health scares and fought drug addiction for years before his death from heart disease and a build-up of fat in his liver, which can be linked to drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
      <p>He came out as gay following his arrest in 1998 for engaging in “a lewd act” in front of an undercover police officer in Beverly Hills.</p>
      <p>Some of his most famous solo work referenced his sexuality and he later said in an interview: “I never had a moral problem with being gay.</p>
      <p>“I thought I had fallen in love with a woman a couple of times. Then I fell in love with a man, and realised that none of those things had been love.”</p>
      <p>Following his death, Michael was praised for his work as a prominent gay rights campaigner.</p>
