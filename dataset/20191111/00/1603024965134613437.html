      <p>Mercedes-Benz recently launched the highest trim of its luxury MPV, the V-Class. Dubbed the V-Class Elite, the trim carries a premium of Rs 28.03 lakh over its lower variant.</p>
      <p>The MPV gets subtle changes such as a revised grille and bumper as well as redesigned alloys. The rear end, however, is completely unchanged. The most prominent changes, can be seen in the interior. These include air-conditioning vents which resemble turbines, reclining rear seats with climate control and massaging functions. The company is also offering a panoramic sliding sunroof and a set of 18-inch wheels as an option. The car also gets a 15-speaker Burmester sound system as standard though it was earlier offered as an option with the Exclusive variant.</p>
      <p>The MPV is offered with three new paint schemes including Steel Blue, Selenite Grey and Graphite Grey. It also carries forward features from its lower trims, such as a 360-degree camera, Thermotronic climate control system, Agility Control suspension, active parking assist, ambient lighting, electric sliding doors and six airbags. It also gets a long wheelbase, with a seating capacity of six passengers.</p>

      <p>The V-Class Elite has a price tag of Rs 1.1 crore (ex-showroom) and has no immediate competition in the market.
