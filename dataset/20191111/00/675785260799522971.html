      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:01:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Trapping working families in poverty is a “fundamental injustice”, the Archbishop of Canterbury claims today.</p>
      <p>The Anglican church’s most senior minister blasted wages which force households to use foodbanks and sink into debt.</p>
      <p>He spoke out as the Living Wage Foundation revealed its updated rates for the voluntary level, marking the start of Living Wage Week.</p>
      <p>Some 210,000 workers paid the rate, which is above the Government’s National Living Wage, will receive £9.30 an hour - up from £9.</p>
      <p>The level rises 20p to £10.75 per hour in London, where costs are higher.</p>
      <p>The UK-wide rate is £1.09 per hour more than the Government’s legal minimum of £8.21.</p>
      <p>Analysis from IHS Markit for KPMG found 5.2 million workers are still paid less than the Real Living Wage.</p>

      <p>Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the Real Living Wage “is about recognising and valuing every person in our society”.</p>
      <p>Insisting that “we all deserve to live with dignity, freedom and hope”, he added: “For people to be trapped in poverty, even as they work long hours to provide for themselves and their families, is a fundamental injustice.</p>
      <p>“Living Wage Week 2019 is a moment to celebrate what can be done when faith organisations, civil society and businesses pull together around values that unite us.</p>
      <p>“With thousands of employers now accredited by the Living Wage Foundation, it’s no longer just a campaign, it’s a movement that is transforming lives.”</p>
      <p>Analysts calculate the voluntary rate taking into account costs like housing, travel and healthy food, and extras like kids’ birthday presents. Bosses say it helps companies’ reputations, employee retention and boosts staff motivation.</p>
      <p>Nearly 6,000 businesses are accredited as Living Wage employers.</p>
      <p>Campaigners said the annual difference between the Real Living Wage and the Government’s legal minimum is more than £2,000 in the UK, climbing to nearly £5,000 in the capital.</p>
      <p>Living Wage Foundation Director Katherine Chapman said: “Today’s new Living Wage rates give a boost to hundreds of thousands of UK workers.</p>
      <p>“Good businesses know that the Real Living Wage means happier, healthier and more motivated workers, and that providing workers with financial security is not only the right thing to do, but has real business benefits.</p>
      <p>“This year for the first-time cities and towns have announced big plans to grow the number of Living Wage employers in their communities.</p>
      <p>“We are delighted at the ambition of Cardiff and Salford to build Living Wage cities, with Cardiff planning to double the number of workers getting the Real Living Wage to nearly 50,000, freeing many more families from the low pay trap.</p>
      <p>“We hope to see many more towns and cities follow suit.”</p>
      <p>The Mirror told in August how the Real Living Wage has pumped more than a billion pounds into the wallets of low-paid workers since it was launched 18 years ago.</p>
