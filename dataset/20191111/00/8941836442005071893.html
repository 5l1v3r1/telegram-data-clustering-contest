      <p>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) - Police have removed an unauthorized camera and apparent tripwire device from the vicinity of a Confederate monument in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
      <p>Charlottesville police spokesman Tyler Hawn said Monday that neither the camera nor the “self-made” device belonged to police. He says officers removed them soon after citizens reported their presence.</p>
      <p>Hawn declined to describe the device beyond saying it didn’t appear to present any threat. Social media posts showed what looked like a tripwire attached to a bell by the base of the statue of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson.</p>
      <p>The city has been trying to remove the statue of Jackson and another of Gen. Robert E. Lee, but a judge has prevented that amid ongoing litigation.</p>
