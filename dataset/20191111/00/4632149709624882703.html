      <p><i>At the Bangalore Mirror event, residents meet BBMP chief and raise questions about the poor state of roads and other infrastructural issues. The good news is that officials have promised that things will be set right and have also sketched a roadmap for the area</i> <br/><br/>The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike is planning to take help from all quarters to fix the city’s Rajakaluves. These storm water drains have deteriorated to such an extent that they are being used to carry untreated sewage into the lakes. Now locals, apartment complexes and corporates will be roped in to redesign them. <br/><br/>At the BM Dialogues event organised at Sobha Dream Acres on Panathur-Belagere Road on Sunday BBMP Commissioner BH Anil Kumar has asked several apartment owners and local residents to take up work on Rajakaluves and create check-dams at several points and wetlands, which will help aid the process of oxidation. <br/><br/>Anil Kumar said, “My suggestion is that the oxidation level of Rajakaluves should essentially be increase. In the natural course of the flow, it takes a long time for oxidation and we need to accelerate this process by creating aerators. A series of check bunds should be created so that when the water flows, there is a process of cleansing.”</p>

      <p>“This process should be taken up in all the Rajakaluves so that we do not allow the untreated water to flow directly into the lakes. When the water is held up more, oxidation can happen. We can also create wetlands, by planting species that can grow on the silt,” he added. He also said that Corporate Social Responsibility wings can come forward to work to improve the health of Rajakaluves. The residents can also take up work and the BBMP will not object to any kind of public partnership related to civic issues, he said.</p>
      <p>There is no proper facility for public transport and it is a huge problem to commute around here. We were promised better and cleaner roads with proper garbage disposal methods, I would like to ask when will they provide us proper roads with streetlights at the very least? ­</p>
      <p>–Kamlesh Kumar<br/><br/><br/>***** <br/><br/><b><u>Greenfield roads to connect Whitefield area<br/></u></b><br/>The Whitefield Tech Corridor will soon get two Greenfield roads so that residents can travel seamlessly from one end to the other. This was announced by BBMP Commissioner BH Anil Kumar during the BM Dialogues event held at Sobha Acres on Balagere-Panathur Road. Unarguably, most of the questions haunting the residents were as to why the roads were not being improved. Kumar said that most of these roads were part of the village roads and lacked proper connectivity. Hence, the BBMP was planning to construct Greenfield roads by acquiring land through TDR and once these roads were ready, it would provide seamless connectivity. <br/>A BBMP official explained that they planned to construct a new road that would connect the outer ring road (ORR) to the proposed location of the peripheral ring road (PRR). This road would start at Kadubeesanahalli (near New Horizon College) and connect Varthur internally. Currently, those staying in and around Panathur, Balagere and Varthur are not well connected. This proposed road which was part of the Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) would be of a length of 5.5 km and will have a width of 150 metres. “Many property owners were willing to offer their land in exchange to TDR,” a BBMP official added. <b><i>— Poojitha Girish<br/></i></b><br/>****** <br/><br/><b><u>Roads &amp; streetlights coming up soon</u></b> <br/><br/>Gaurav Mishra, a resident had raised questions about the potholed roads. The government has sanctioned Rs 250 crore for the 10 major roads of Mahadevapura zone out of which one is the Panathur-Balagere road. BBMP Commissioner BH Anil Kumar said, “We have sufficient funds for the underpasses and for the widening of the railway line. We will take up the streetlights and the footpaths work in this area and ensure that there are concrete roads from Panathur upto Balalgere area. In all, 35 km of roads in this area will be taken up for development.” BBMP is also taking up retendering of 14 roads in Whitefield, in which 48.9 km of roads leading to International Tech Park will be redeveloped.</p>
