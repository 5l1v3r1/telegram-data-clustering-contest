      <p>What does it mean to be rich? If you were to pose this question to a random sampling of folks on the street, you’d likely receive wildly different answers. Some may think of being rich as simply making a lot of money or having a lot of money. Others may not define a rich life through monetary measures at all — instead, saying a rich life is having good health, close relationships with family and friends, and a fulfilling career. Still others may say true wealth equates to freedom — being able to do what you want, when you want.  </p>
      <p>Who’s right? </p>
      <p>I recently caught up with <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/about/about-ramit/">Ramit Sethi</a>, bestselling author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-Rich-Second-ebook/dp/B07GNXPP4P/ref=sr_1_35?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538846285&amp;sr=1-35&amp;refinements=p_45%3A9%2Cp_46%3AAfter%2Cp_47%3A2018"><i>I Will Teach You to Be Rich</i></a><i>,</i> to get some answers. Sethi has a unique perspective on the definition of wealth as he’s taught hundreds of thousands of readers how to make financial choices that align with what they value most. Read on to learn about Sethi’s thoughts on what it means to live a rich life and how he himself has sought to achieve greater fulfillment while meeting his financial goals.    </p>
      <p><b>Roger Ma</b>: What does living a rich life mean to you?</p>
      <p><b>Ramit Sethi</b>: My definition of a Rich Life has changed over time. When I first moved to New York, a Rich Life was being able to take a taxi in the summer instead of sweating in a <a href="https://www.lifelaidout.com/blog/2017/7/11/should-you-still-be-getting-an-unlimited-subway-pass">subway station</a>. As I started to grow my business, that definition changed — Rich was being able to order appetizers, because I never did that growing up. </p>
      <p>Now, it’s all of those things, plus the ability to spend my time and money on the areas that are important to me: convenience (my primary <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/money-dials/">Money Dial</a>), working from home, traveling every year with my wife, and bringing our family along whenever we can. </p>
      <p><b>Roger Ma</b>: A lot of personal finance advice focuses on telling people what they <i>can’t</i> spend money on — like lattes, avocado toast, or clothes — as a way to help people gain financial stability and live their rich life. Do you think this is an effective strategy?</p>
      <p><b>Ramit Sethi</b>: So many personal finance experts start by telling you what you CAN’T do with your money:</p>
      <p>No, you can’t buy lattes.</p>
      <p>No, you can’t buy jeans.</p>
      <p>No, you can’t go on vacation.</p>
      <p>In fact, why don’t they just tell you to live in a cave for the next 75 years and hoard your money? That’s effectively what they’re saying. The great irony is that nobody listens. Americans don’t want to be told no — they want to understand how to live a Rich Life.</p>
      <p>I always encourage people to spend extravagantly on the things they love, as long as they cut costs mercilessly on the things they don’t. Ask yourself: What do you <i>love</i> spending money on? Not just “like,” but love. Now ask yourself what it would feel like to quadruple your spending in that area. </p>
      <p>When I ask people this, their eyes light up. The most common response is “travel,” followed by “eating out,” then “health/wellness” as the third. These are examples of <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/money-dials/">Money Dials</a>, or the areas we <i>love</i> to spend money on.</p>
      <p>When you ask people what it would feel like to actually spend <i>more</i> on the things they love, it’s amazing to watch. Most of us have been surrounded by so many people telling us “no” around our money that we’ve never thought about what saying “yes” would feel like.</p>
      <p>You don’t have to limit yourself to thinking that “rich” has to fit into a particular image either, like working on Wall Street or eating at certain restaurants. It’s your Rich Life — you choose.</p>
      <p><b>Roger Ma</b>: When it’s time to take action and make your rich life a reality, you talk about tackling <a href="https://podcastnotes.org/2019/07/09/ramit-5/">$3 vs. $30,000 problems</a>. Why do you think people spend more time on $3 problems, and how can they reprogram themselves to focus on the big ticket items instead?</p>
      <p><b>Ramit Sethi</b>: The media loves to tell you to focus on saving money and not buy lattes. Deciding whether to buy a latte or not is what I call a $3 question. Instead of focusing on those small wins, buy as many lattes as you want, and think bigger. Focus on the $30,000 questions, such as getting a great job, <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/guides/ultimate-guide-to-asking-for-a-raise-and-negotiating-salary/">negotiating your salary</a>, finding the right partner, and making the right decision about if and when to buy a home and save for retirement. Get these 5-10 Big Wins right and you’ll never have to worry about lattes or appetizers. It’s a lot more fun, too.</p>
      <p><b>Roger Ma</b>: When trying to tackle the $30,000 question of choosing the right career, how can people strike a balance between how much their rich life may cost and the sacrifices that may be required (in work hours) to achieve that life?</p>
      <p><b>Ramit Sethi</b>: I think it’s important to be honest with yourself. That means, being honest with the stories you tell yourself about what you want and what’s important to you. If you claim you want to achieve a certain salary or title, have you studied what other people in that title did to get there? Have you done informational interviews? Did their answers get you excited?</p>
      <p>I think it’s also healthy to challenge the status quo and not just assume a particular career path will lock you into a certain lifestyle. For example, the stereotype may be that if you want to be a lawyer, you’ll work night and day, but I know there are great lawyers that aren’t working those kinds of hours. If you want to become a lawyer, but also want a manageable lifestyle, track down those lawyers that have found a way to find balance in their lives, take them out for coffee, and ask them how they were able to do it.    </p>
      <p>I’m also a big fan of experimentation and testing. Many times, people build an entire life around a dream, whether choosing a particular career or dreaming about living in a certain kind of house. </p>
      <p>My advice is before committing to a lifestyle that you lock yourself into, try it out once and see if you like it. If your dream is to own a super high-end car, rent it for a week! Do you still want it? Turn your big dream you have into a micro reality, and see if it’s what you really want.</p>
      <p><b>Roger Ma</b>: How can someone fresh out of college who wants to pursue a less traditional career path tune out the nay-sayers, especially if those people are their friends and family? How did you overcome your parents’ expectation that you should have a safe company job?</p>
      <p><b>Ramit Sethi</b>:<b> </b>Jim Rohn said, “Don’t wish it were easier, wish you were better.” I used to think that as I became more successful that people would stop giving me advice, but the opposite is actually true. People will always have an opinion on what they think you <i>should</i> do.</p>
      <p>For those giving you advice, I’d ask myself, “Is this person in a position that I want to be in?” For example, you wouldn’t take financial advice from someone who was broke, just like you wouldn’t take career advice from someone who had a mediocre trajectory. </p>
      <p>I’d also try to harness their advice using verbal jiu jitsu. Ask them, “What would you do if you were me?” This way, instead of fighting them and getting frustrated, you seek advice from them and make them an ally. I find that a lot of my readers on <a href="https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/">iwillteachyoutoberich.com</a> get pressured from parents and revert into a parent-child relationship. It’s important to set boundaries and change your interaction, which begins with you.</p>
      <p>Nobody goes from 0 to 60 in an instant. No matter if it’s the career you choose, who you marry, where you live, or what you do — small actions make a huge difference over time. Each time you question the norm, you are building a muscle that will allow you to live your rich life.   </p>
      <p><b>Roger Ma</b>: Knowing what you know now, what advice would you give to 21 year old Ramit (and more broadly, to those that are disciplined and driven, but just starting out)?</p>
      <p><b>Ramit Sethi</b>: I’d tell myself to loosen up and have more fun. If my friends invited me to Burning Man and I was 24, I should have said yes. I should have banned the phrase, “I can’t afford that.” It’s like saying you’re too busy. When I look back, and when I was most rigid, I was less successful. When I was most flexible, those are the times when I was most successful in  relationships, finances, and careers.</p>
