      <p>On the current World Digital Song Sales chart, BTS falls from No. 1 to No. 2 with their single “Make It Right” with pop singer Lauv, making way for longtime favorite “Someone Over the Rainbow” by Israel "IZ" Kamakawiwo'Ole to return to the peak. They may not be ruling the <i>Billboard</i> ranking any longer, but the band proved their incredible popularity with their most recent leader, which granted them yet another champion in what has turned out to be the best year of the band’s career.In 2019 alone, BTS has charted an incredible seven No. 1 hits on the World Digital Song Sales ranking, which they have become used to ruling in the past several years. Seven chart-toppers on any list in a single calendar year is a major accomplishment for any act on any one of <i>Billboard</i>’s weekly lists, but the Korean septet’s success is even more impressive when compared to other acts working in their field.</p>
      <p>BTS has landed more No. 1 hits on the World Digital Song Sales chart in 2019 alone than any other K-pop has throughout their entire careers. In second place among all K-pop musicians is Blackpink, who have managed to send five tracks to the top over the years, while fellow stars Psy and Big Bang have both collected four rulers, but none of them have done so in a single year.</p>
      <p>Thanks to their seven most recent champions, BTS has now reached the summit an astounding 17 times, which is more than most of the other K-pop No. 1s combined.</p>
      <p>This year, BTS has occupied the penthouse on the World Digital Song Sales with the following seven singles: “Boy with Luv” with Halsey, “Lights,” “Make It Right” with Lauv, “Heartbeat,” “Dream Glow” with Charli XCX, “A Brand New Day” with Zara Larsson and “All Night” with Juice WRLD. </p>
      <p>Impressively, those seven singles are not all featured on one album. In fact, two are from their recent Billboard 200 chart-topper <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i> (“Boy with Luv” and “Make It Right,” though the remixed version that ruled isn’t featured on the original full-length), four are on their mobile game soundtrack <i>BTS World</i> (“Heartbeat,” “Dream Glow,” “All Night” and “A Brand New Day”) and one, “Lights,” isn’t yet attached to a project.</p>
