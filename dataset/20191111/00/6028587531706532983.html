      <p>If you ever watched the “Coach’s Corner” feature on Hockey Night in Canada on CBC, it probably comes as no surprise that commentator Don Cherry has some strongly held views. In an American context, the outspoken one-time coach comes across like a combination between Mike Ditka and Rush Limbaugh, championing an old fashioned smashmouth approach to sports combined with a self-declared “extreme right wing” cultural perspective. And in today’s cancel culture, it seemed like only a matter of time before Cherry’s militant Canadian nationalism and lack of filter would land him in the penalty box.Today, Sportsnet, Cherry’s employer, confirmed that they have parted ways with the 85 year-old commentator following a segment that aired Saturday night where Cherry lashed out at new immigrants in Toronto and Mississauga, Ontario for showing insufficient respect for Canadian military veterans.</p>
      <p>“You people, you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey... at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that [to honor veterans],” Cherry said during the broadcast. “These guys paid for the way of life you enjoy in Canada. These guys paid the biggest price.”</p>
      <p>The outcry against Cherry was immediate and overwhelming. The system set up by Canadian broadcasters to gather public comment could not keep up with the volume of negative response. The National Hockey League called Cherry’s remarks “offensive and contrary to the values we believe in.”</p>
      <p>Sportsnet, the division of Rogers Media that packages Hockey Night in Canada for CBC, issued a statement on Monday saying: “Sports brings people together – it unites us, not divides us. Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night’s broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down. During the broadcast, he made divisive remarks that do not represent our values or what we stand for.”</p>
      <p>Sportsnet went on to say that “Don is synonymous with hockey and has played an integral role in growing the game over the past 40 years. We would like to thank Don for his contributions to hockey and sports broadcasting in Canada.”</p>
      <p>The former coach of the Boston Bruins when Bobby Orr led them to the Stanley Cup in the early 1970s has been a fixture for decades, making an immediate visual impression with his flamboyant attire and offering his cantankerous commentary in a buddy-act with his more subdued co-anchor Ron MacLean. At a time when hockey was trying to clean up its violent image, Cherry consistently voiced his preference for a more physical game, showcasing the tactical contributions of “hard hat, lunchbucket” players and disdain for the showboats - particularly those from Europe. He has gone so far as to praise the cruelties of the sport, such as the hazing of first-year players, as character-building.</p>
      <p>Cherry is also an outspoken advocate for the military and veterans, a champion of Canada’s youth hockey programs, and is not shy about his conservative politics. He is known to be extremely generous with his time, always signing autographs for fans, turning up at youth hockey events to give impromptu pep talks, and supporting community events.</p>
      <p>But over the years, his perspective, like his suits, got louder and less nuanced. He often went on rants about crime, military pride, traditional values and similar topics, sometimes consigning hockey commentary to a few perfunctory observations during the 5-minute Coach’s Corner segments.</p>
      <p>While his brusque persona remains a good fit with a segment of the viewership - many of whom took to Twitter today to express outrage at his dismissal - he’s also symbolic of cultural divisions within Canada that were on display earlier this month in the national election. Immigration is a hot button north of the border as well, and slurs against new Canadians is not something Sportsnet, Rogers or the CBC could endure.</p>
      <p>Considering how central Cherry’s “red-faced uncle” persona was to his appeal, his employers surely had to expect that sooner or later, his controversial views would land him - and them - in trouble. Sure enough, Cherry finally got his game misconduct penalty this weekend, right on the eve of Remembrance Day, Canada’s national holiday honoring veterans (corresponding to Memorial Day in the US).</p>
      <p>Love him or hate him, Don Cherry put his stamp on hockey and broadcasting. It’s the end of an era, and it’s fair to say we probably won’t see his like come around again any time soon.</p>
