      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Health officials have confirmed the first two flu-related deaths this season - one each in Clark and Washoe counties.</p>
      <p>The Washoe County Health District says the unidentified patient contracted Influenza A and died between Sept. 29 and Oct. 26 of this year. A total of nine people were hospitalized with the flu in Washoe County over the same time period.</p>
      <p>The district hasn’t released any other details about the fatality.</p>
      <p>Officials for the Southern Nevada Health District say Clark County’s only flu-related death this season occurred between Oct. 27 and Nov. 2. That person was over the age of 65, but no other details have been released.</p>
      <p>The Clark County death occurred during a week when there were more than 60 hospitalizations from the flu or flu-related illness in the Las Vegas area. The number of cases there already are outpacing last year’s.</p>
