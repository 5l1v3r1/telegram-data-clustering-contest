      <h1>Jason Garrett under fire for Cowboys’ late-game choices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/matthew-paras/" target="_blank">Matthew Paras</a></address>
      <p>In prime time, Cowboys coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jason-garrett/">Jason Garrett</a> didn’t have his best showing. </p>
      <p>After a 28-24 loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jason-garrett/">Garrett</a> was heavily criticized for his team’s late-game decision making, choosing to run the ball with Ezekiel Elliott inside the red zone instead of riding Dak Prescott’s hot hand. </p>
      <p>With under five minutes left, down four, the Cowboys began a drive at their-own 26-yard line — and moved the ball effortlessly down the field. Prescott found Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and Jason Witten to get to Minnesota’ 11-yard line with 1:57 left. </p>
      <p>That’s when Dallas went to Elliott. </p>
      <p>On second and third down, the Cowboys called two straight runs for Elliott, their $90 million, to try and pick up two yards to get the first down. On the first run, Elliott failed to gain a yard and on his second rushing attempt, he was tackled for a loss of three yards. </p>

      <p>On fourth-and-5, an obvious passing situation, Prescott threw an incomplete pass to Elliott — resulting in a turnover on downs. </p>
      <p>The loss dropped the Cowboys to 5-4 on the season, and commentators were quick to point the finger at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jason-garrett/">Garrett</a> afterward:</p>
