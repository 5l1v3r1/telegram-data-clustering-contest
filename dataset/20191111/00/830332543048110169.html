      <p>GREEN BAY, Wis. - Aaron Jones scored three touchdowns in the Packers' win over the Panthers, 24-16, in a game where it was hard to see the ball towards the end.</p>
      <p>Carolina got on the board first, thanks to a touchdown pass from Kyle Allen to Curtis Samuel. But after that, it was all Green Bay.</p>
      <p>The Panthers failed to convert a two-point conversion in the 4th quarter, and the Packers defense held up at the goal line as time expired.</p>
      <p>The Packers are 8-2 heading into a bye week.</p>
