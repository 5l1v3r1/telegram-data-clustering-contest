      <h3>OBSERVATIONS FROM THE FINTECH SNARK TANK</h3>
      <p>A Wall Street Journal article titled <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-dont-know-what-to-do-with-their-branches-11573128001?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1">Banks Don’t Know What to Do With Their Branches</a> reported:</p>
      <blockquote>“A visit to two [bank branch] locations on a recent morning illustrates one of the biggest head-scratchers in the banking business: what to do with the insides of their bricks-and-mortar storefronts.”</blockquote>
      <p>The article starts by noting that “drinks are on the house” at a Capital One bank branch in Philadelphia, and that at a nearby PNC branch, “there is a Keurig machine for anyone who wants coffee.”</p>
      <p>Before you get too excited, the “drinks” at the Capital One branch are coffee-related beverages.</p>
      <p>The rest of the article relates anecdotes from an investment firm that went around town opening accounts one day, but it doesn’t really make the case that bank are “struggling” with what to do with their branches.</p>
      <p>In fact, the article states, “US banks have closed thousands of branches in recent years.” Doesn’t seem like there’s much head-scratching going on. Just close the suckers down. End of story, right?</p>
      <p>Not quite.</p>
      <p>Anti-branch pundits often think a bank can just decide to close a branch and somehow, magically, break a lease or find a buyer for the location with no trouble.</p>
      <p>Doesn’t work that way. Banks looking to downsize their branch presence have to figure out something to do with the space.</p>
      <h3>What About Co-Working Spaces?</h3>
      <p>Although coffee shops get the most attention for branch reinvention, Jim Marous, publisher of the Digital Banking Report advocates turning branches into <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/81096/banking-small-business-coworking-future-of-work-trends/">co-working community spaces</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“While organizations like Capital One have opted for a coffee shop concept, other financial institutions are beginning to sublet or create coworking spaces for small businesses not yet ready for larger facilities of their own.”</blockquote>
      <p>Marous argues that this approach can engage small businesses and become a source of new lending relationships and even cash flow.</p>
      <p>This might be a good solution for a few banks and a few (very few) branches, but let’s get realistic here: The percentage of branches that are candidates to become co-working spaces is very small.</p>
      <p>And I could argue that the majority of people hanging out in co-working spaces aren’t the ones making banking and borrowing decisions for their companies.</p>
      <h3>Bold New Ideas for Branch Transformation</h3>
      <p>We can do better than just coffee shops and hang out spots for Millennial gig economy workers. Here are some suggestions for what banks could do with their branches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Bankaurants.</b> Let’s be honest. Many bank branch employees do nothing but “take the order” when customers come in after researching their product decisions online. If they’re going to take our financial orders, then why not take our food orders while they’re at it? Reality is, at this point, consumers are more likely to go to a restaurant to eat than go to a bank branch to do their banking. But if you combine the two…</li>
        <li><b>Finspas. </b>According to one <a href="https://blog.marketresearch.com/the-growth-of-the-global-spa-industry">source</a>,<b> </b>the 120,000 spas around the world generated $99 billion in revenue in 2015, and are <a href="https://www.marketresearch.com/Infiniti-Research-Limited-v2680/Global-Spa-10915075/?progid=89756">expected</a> to grow at a CAGR of 5.66 through 2021. In contrast, bank revenues are <a href="https://www.statista.com/forecasts/409713/banking-revenue-in-the-us">expected</a> to grow at a CAGR of 2.5% over the same period. Why not train manicurists to engage customers in discussions about their financial needs?</li>
        <li><b>Medibanks.</b> People who go to the hospital spend a lot of their time there heavily medicated. What better time to sell someone banking services? [More] Seriously though, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettwhysel/2018/06/27/3-vicious-cycles/#165d1db5540d">research</a> increasingly showing the cross-effects of financial, mental, and physical health, providing all three services in a single location could make a lot of sense.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The Power of the Bundle</h3>
      <p>Laugh all you want at my suggestions, but suggestions to re-deploy branches as cafes or co-working spaces address the wrong question, which is: How do we get people back into our branches?</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Instead, banks should be asking: How can we make more profitable use of the space we have?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Cornerstone Advisors <a href="https://www.strategycorps.com/accessorizing">surveyed</a> consumers and asked them what they would do if Amazon offered a checking account bundled with services like cell phone damage protection, ID theft protection, and roadside assistance, for a $5 to $10 monthly fee.</p>
      <p>Among Millennials in their 20s, 37% said they would open that account, and 46% of Millennials in their 30s said they’d open their account.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Consumer demand for an Amazon checking account<cite>Cornerstone Advisors</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This isn’t a sign that Millennials want Amazon as a bank. It’s a signal that consumers want more value from the things they pay and that they’d be more than willing to get a checking account from someone who can bundle services they want–and pay for–with a checking account.</p>
      <p>So why not bundle checking accounts with spa services, meals, or health services in order to improve the <i>value </i>of going to a bank branch?</p>
      <h3>Silly Arguments for the Branch</h3>
      <p>Supporters of bank branches argue that consumers still want the “human touch.”</p>
      <p>They’re absolutely right.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that’s not an argument supporting bank branches. Who said the “human touch” had to be provided by someone sitting in a building called a bank branch?</p>
      <p>Why not use Facetime to allow electronically-mediated interactions between people?</p>
      <p>Here’s a radical idea: Why not provide customers with the phone numbers of bank employees they can call to ask a question and get an answer? (Crazy, I know).</p>
      <p>The Branchophiles don’t get it. Nobody cares that their bank has a “branch.” People care about having access to bank employees who can help resolve problems and answer questions.</p>
      <p>I don’t know what banks will ultimately do with their branches, but I do know this: there’s only so much coffee we can drink.</p>
