      <p>As Black Friday creeps inexorably nearer, it’s good to start your research now into what price deals are here now or coming soon. Let me help. Below, check out the best wearables and the bargains confirmed already, some of which are now live, so you needn’t wait until Black Friday itself, which this year falls at the very end of the month, on November 29. I’ll be updating this post as new deals launch, so please check back. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>The latest generation of Apple Watch, Series 5, was released in September, so it’s the one model which may not receive big discounts this year. There are some, though. And this is certainly the best watch from Apple so far, with its always-on display the main upgrade this time.</p>
      <p>Series 3, which premiered in 2017, is already a real bargain now – prices start from $199 – so there may not be huge discounts but any there are will make this already keenly priced gadget even more desirable.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The real standout this Black Friday is likely to be last year’s Series 4. It is no longer sold by Apple, so retailers will be wanting to clear remaining stock. And – get this – if you aren’t worried about the always-on display, in almost every other respect, this is as good as Series 5: same processor, same dazzling design and so on. </p>
      <p>Note that Apple only announces its special buys much nearer to Black Friday and, usually, these involve full prices but with vouchers to spend in Apple Stores. Please check back as I’ll add the deals as soon as they’re known.</p>

        <i>Best Buy</i>
      </p>
      <p>Best Buy currently has one really standout offer, for Apple Watch Series 4, GPS + Cellular in stainless steel. The 40mm size used to sell for $649. You can save $250 just now for the gold stainless-steel model in GPS + Cellular 40mm with stone sport band, reduced to $399. Buy it in gold <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-cellular-40mm-gold-stainless-steel-case-with-stone-sport-band-gold-stainless-steel/6139675.p?skuId=6139675">here</a>, space black with black sport band <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-cellular-40mm-space-black-stainless-steel-case-with-black-sport-band-space-black-stainless-steel/6139673.p?skuId=6139673">here</a> and stainless steel with white sport band <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-cellular-40mm-stainless-steel-case-with-white-sport-band-stainless-steel/6139670.p?skuId=6139670">here</a>.</p>
      <p>If you fancy the larger, 44mm size, there’s an even bigger saving, $300 as the previous price of $699 is reduced to the same as the smaller case: $399.</p>
      <p>Available in stainless steel with sport band (buy here), space black stainless steel with black sport band (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-cellular-44mm-space-black-stainless-steel-case-with-black-sport-band-space-black-stainless-steel/6139651.p?skuId=6139651">here</a>) and gold with stone sport band (<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-cellular-44mm-gold-stainless-steel-case-with-stone-sport-band-gold-stainless-steel/6139655.p?skuId=6139655">here</a>).</p>
      <p>Best Buy has Series 4, though not with the big discounts Walmart has, below. Still you can buy, for instance, a Series 4 with GPS only in 40mm size in gold aluminum and pink sand sport band for $299, a $50 saving on the $349 previous price. It’s available to buy <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-40mm-gold-aluminum-case-with-pink-sand-sport-band-gold-aluminum/5543401.p?skuId=5543401">here</a>. If you prefer a larger size, the 44mm gold aluminum with the same pink sand sport band is also $50 off at $329 instead of the original $379, buy it <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-4-gps-44mm-gold-aluminum-case-with-pink-sand-sport-band-gold-aluminum/5543802.p?skuId=5543802">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Best Buy’s Apple Watch Series 3 reductions are smaller. You can find $10 off the 38mm size, $189 instead of $199, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-apple-watch-series-3-gps-38mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band-space-gray-aluminum/5706618.p?skuId=5706618">here</a>, but no discount on the 42mm model. </p>

      <p>There are now three versions of AirPods available to buy: AirPods, now in second-generation, which is the latest model.

Read on for current or upcoming deals. </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Fitbit</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest smartwatch from Fitbit is the Versa 2 which means, you guessed it, there will be discounts on the previous model, the Fitbit Versa. If you’re eager for a smartwatch with a voice assistant built in then you need the Versa 2 with Alexa on board (or an Apple Watch for instance). There will be savings on Versa 2, but they’re not available just yet. See Best Buy, below.</p>
      <p>But if that’s not your priority, the original Versa has the same design and is still pretty capable. It comes in a regular edition and a Special Edition with a slightly different design and strap. Oh, there’s also a Lite Edition which sells for $159.99 and has fewer capabilities than the original Versa.</p>
      <p><i>Best Buy</i> has the Fitbit Versa Special Edition already reduced to its Black Friday price. That’s a drop of $80 from $199.95 to $119.95. Note that the reduced price only applies to the charcoal color. If you prefer the lavender rose gold, then it’s at the full $199.95 price. Buy the charcoal one <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/fitbit-versa-special-edition-charcoal/6203314.p?skuId=6203314">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Fitbit Versa Lite will be reduced from $159.95 to $99.95, a saving of $60, but that offer is not live yet. Similarly, the new Fitbit Versa 2 is being reduced from $199.95 to $149.95, but you’re going to have to wait a little longer for that. </p>
      <p><i>Amazon</i> has Fitbit Versa reduced from $169.95 to $135, a saving of $34.95. It’s available in black only and you can buy it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Versa-Smart-Aluminium-Included/dp/B07B48SQGT/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=fitbit+versa&amp;qid=1573404372&amp;sr=8-2">here</a>. If you fancy a regular tracker rather than a full-on smartwatch, then the Fitbit Charge 3 may suit. It’s reduced from $149.95 to $137.67, a saving of $12.28. Prefer a rose gold and blue-grey finish? That’s available for $134, a saving of $15.95 on the $149.95 price.</p>
      <p>A special edition version in either lavender or graphite and white silicone is reduced from $169.95 to $158.49, a saving of $11.46.</p>
      <p>All are available <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Fitness-Activity-Graphite-Included/dp/B07G19YRMF/ref=sxin_2_osp44-57b0abcd_cov?ascsubtag=57b0abcd-86e5-4841-a4ae-633e19e57fbf&amp;creativeASIN=B07FTN21JL&amp;cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.57b0abcd-86e5-4841-a4ae-633e19e57fbf&amp;cv_ct_pg=search&amp;cv_ct_wn=osp-search&amp;keywords=fitbit&amp;linkCode=oas&amp;pd_rd_i=B07FTN21JL&amp;pd_rd_r=a9adc003-7aec-4d57-8438-8e0961df7d2b&amp;pd_rd_w=Lfd3y&amp;pd_rd_wg=ridcl&amp;pf_rd_p=a23a388c-add5-49df-b293-a31ade89c6bf&amp;pf_rd_r=AW624471S087SZ7HBP2M&amp;qid=1573404479&amp;tag=reviewscom07-20&amp;th=1">here</a>.</p>

      <p><i>Walmart</i> has the original Fitbit Versa reduced – it’s a clearance price rather than Black Friday but at least it’s available now. In black the price drops from $199 to $169.95, a saving of $29.05. Stocks are low. But if you like the look of the peach colored version, that’s reduced by $51.93 to $147.93, and stocks are more plentiful. Both are available to buy <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fitbit-Versa-Smartwatch/673273964?selected=true">here</a>.</p>
      <p>As more offers emerge, I’ll be updating this post, so please check back. </p>
