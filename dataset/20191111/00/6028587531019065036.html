      <p>The difference between a good podcast and a great podcast comes down to the microphone being used. The same goes for Skype, recording a voiceover or just about anything else that uses a microphone. If you use the cheap mic built into a laptop, you’re likely to end up sounding as if you’re in a cupboard, plus the mic will pick up the sound of the hard drive whirring away inside your computer. You can have the most exciting content on your podcast, or even the most important things to say during your Skype call, but if the person at the other end can’t hear you clearly, you might as well use two cocoa tins and a piece of string as your method of communication.A really good microphone can pick up every emotion or nuance in a voice, and it can capture the timbre and pitch, lending a rich and warm presence that people will enjoy listening to. Fortunately, it’s not too hard to get professional-sounding voice recordings or calls on a PC or Mac, thanks to USB microphones like the Yeti X from Blue that I’m going to be reviewing here. You simply plug the microphone into the USB port of a computer, and it will be recognized as an input device and you’re ready to start recording or making that important voice call.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/">Blue</a> was originally set up in 1995 by an American session musician, Skipper Wise, and a Latvian recording engineer, Martins Saulespurens. The company’s name is short for <i>Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics</i> and it’s based in Westlake Village, California. Blue was acquired in July 2018 by American Swiss peripheral company <a href="https://www.logitech.com/">Logitech </a>– or Logi as it seems to be known these days. Blue’s Snowball mic was probably one of the most widespread mics used by budding musicians recording demo tapes in their bedrooms. It’s fair to say it has probably been responsible for launching quite a few music careers and has been incredibly popular due to its affordability, great sound, and cute design.</p>

      <p>I think I bought my first original Blue Yeti condenser mic about 10 years ago. It was a monster of a mic and the really good thing about it was the inclusion of a headphone jack that enabled me to hear myself talking through my headphones as well as the person I was talking to. Previously, when using USB headsets, I could hear the other person on a Skype call, but I couldn’t hear myself talking through the headphones too, and that made it difficult to talk at a normal level. With the Yeti I could adjust the volume of the headphones, as well as the pick-up pattern of the condenser capsules in the microphone, with choices between stereo, omnidirectional, cardioid or even bi-directional so two people could share a mic facing each other. The cardioid pattern was great as it isolated my voice coming from the front and cut out other sounds in the room. Cardioid mics are the type often used for professional radio broadcasts and they give the impression the speaker is talking directly to you and no one else. It’s a personal way of recording a message creating maximum engagement.</p>
      <p>The original Yeti was a fine mic, but it had a few reliability issues and the selector for the pick-up pattern and volume blend felt a little heavy and slightly homespun. No matter, it sounded great and lots of people still swear by this USB microphone and its professional sound. However, Blue has refreshed the Yeti line-up with a brand-new model: The Yeti X. This new condenser mic incorporates many of the original Yeti’s excellent qualities but with a more up-to-date set of controls and plenty of extra features, including the ability to use software to tweak the Yeti X’s frequency response and to store custom settings like input levels, volume and even the default pick-up pattern of the Yeti X, all with a single click of a preset.</p>
      <p>Logitech has now added Blue’s VO!CE app to its G-Hub software, a package that can control a variety of Logitech devices such as mice and keyboards. Blue VO!CE is sophisticated in how it can customize the Yeti X, it will even impress professional sound engineers. There are controls for compressor, noise reduction, limiter and lots more. If you don’t want to delve into all that, the software offers some ready-made presets to give sounds described as broadcast, warm and vintage, high voices, low voices, and just about everything in between. Each preset can be adjusted and stored as a custom setting tailored to an individual’s voice perfectly.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Yeti X looks similar in its physical styling to the original Yeti mic, except it now comes in a smart black finish. The shape is slightly squat and square and weighs in at a hefty 1.3 kg. This is one well-made piece of kit that should withstand years of use. The mic stand is a similar design to the one used on the original Yeti, and the mic can be detached from the stand and screwed onto a standard threaded mic holder if that’s required. The Yeti X connects to its host computer via a Micro USB port. I would have preferred to see the more robust USB-C used, but that’s about the only downside I can think of at the moment.</p>
      <p>At the rear of the mic there’s a push-button that cycles through the four pickup patterns that the Yeti X offers. The four patterns are stereo, omni, cardioid, plus bi-directional to pick up two speakers facing each other. The pattern in use is indicated by a backlit symbol and even this can be changed in the G-Hub software. Now that’s what I call attention to detail.</p>
      <p>At the front of the Yeti X there’s a rotary dial with a knob in the middle that has three uses: It can change the input level of the mic so that you don’t have to go into the sound settings of your PC or Mac to get the levels right; it can adjust the feedback volume going to the headphones that are plugged into the Yeti X; and it can alter the blend of the levels between your voice and the sound that’s coming in from the computer, such as the person you may be talking to on Facetime or Skype, or the remote voice coming from a radio station that you might be linked up to via something like <a href="https://sip.audio/">SIP </a>or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IpDTL">ipDTL</a>. This is the most comprehensive set of functions I’ve ever seen on a USB mic and I’m very impressed. To change between the rotary dial’s three functions, you just need to hold in the knob for two seconds and it will cycle through each function, one after the other.</p>

        <figcaption>The dial on the front of the Yeti X has multiple functions and can be customized using the VO!CE ... [+] software.<cite>Blue</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A series of 11 LEDs ranged around the rotary dial show the levels set, and the color of the LEDs can be changed to whichever color you’d like to use. Those LEDs provide real-time metering of the recording levels with indicators for when the input is peaking. If the knob is pressed in briefly, it will mute the mic and the LEDs will begin pulsing, as if they are breathing, to indicate that the mic is dead. Once again, the behavior of all the LEDs can be easily adjusted and saved in a preset for the ultimate customized set-up.</p>
      <p>The Yeti X has a warm and rich tone, capturing the smallest of details in any voice. It works equally well for recording instruments or vocals, and with the pattern setup to omni, it can be used to record everything from a small garage band to a 1,000-voice choir. The sound can be captured with almost any recording software from the excellent and free <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, all the way up to Apple’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a> or any other professional recording software. </p>

        <figcaption>The Blue Yeti X is probably the best USB condenser mic on the market right now. It's a real triumph.<cite>Blue</cite></figcaption>

      <p><b>Verdict:</b> Blue has scored a direct hit with the new Yeti X microphone. Not only does it have the classic Yeti sound, but it also has the most customizable controls that I’ve ever seen on a mic and that makes it incredibly versatile and flexible. I love the G-Hub software and how it offers so many tweaks and settings to the sound, plus the ability to customize the color of the LED lights and how they behave. Blue has thought of everything and I wouldn’t change a thing about the Yeti X except, perhaps, the Micro USB input. This is the perfect studio mic for podcasters, musicians, voiceover artists or anyone who wants to create a better impression on Facetime, Skype, SIP or any other VOIP application. This is the best USB Studio mic on the market.</p>
      <p><b>Pricing and availability:</b> The Blue Yeti X is available now and retails at $170 / £169 / €180</p>
