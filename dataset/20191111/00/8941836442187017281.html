      <p>BOURNE, Mass. (AP) - Two Massachusetts men have embarked on a 500-mile (800-kilometer) run to raise awareness about veteran suicide.</p>
      <p>Josh Milich and Brian Tjersland left Massachusetts National Cemetery in Bourne on Monday and will run to Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.</p>
      <p>Milich and Tjersland are avid runners who have finished 100-mile races.</p>
      <p>The men are aiming to raise $100,000 for Mission 22, a nonprofit organization that treats veterans who have post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
      <p>Milich, who is serving in the Coast Guard, tells WBZ-TV the purpose of this run is to “let people know there is a problem.”</p>
