        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>A great victory for freedom was achieved in Bolivia this past Sunday, after Socialist President Evo Morales resigned and fled the capital, La Paz, under pressure from armed forces Chief Gen. Williams Kalimantan. The Oct. 20 elections were found to have been rigged by Cuban and Venezuelan Communists, and election monitors said the elections were fraudulent.</p>
      <p>The armed forces declared themselves to be neutral but stepped in to restore peace after three weeks of demonstrations throughout Bolivia. The protests were over an increasingly bad economy and leftist, big-government, dictatorial policies. By taking control, the armed forces caused the resignation of one of the longest-serving Socialist presidents, who in 2006 had taken power as part of the ‘pink tide’ in Latin America, bought by Red China and Russia. Morales’ closest ally was Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro, who gave much economic and military aid to Bolivia. He is now suffering a great setback, as President Trump is opening free markets and growing prosperity in Latin America.</p>
