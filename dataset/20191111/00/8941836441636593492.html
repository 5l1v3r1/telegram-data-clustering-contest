      <p>LEWES, Del. (AP) - Delaware State Police say a driver failed to signal a lane change, and a subsequent traffic stop found the driver to be in possession of heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, opioids and prescription pills.</p>
      <p>A police statement says a trooper pulled over 51-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harry-johnson-jr/">Harry Johnson Jr.</a> after witnessing the traffic violation and smelled marijuana coming from the vehicle. It say further investigation determined that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harry-johnson-jr/">Johnson</a> was driving under the influence of drugs, and a search of his vehicle uncovered the drugs and drug paraphernalia.</p>
      <p>WBOC-TV reports <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harry-johnson-jr/">Johnson</a> was arrested last week and charged with related offense including possession of a controlled substance with an intent to deliver. It’s unclear if <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/harry-johnson-jr/">Johnson</a> has a lawyer. He was given a secured bond of about $80,000.</p>
