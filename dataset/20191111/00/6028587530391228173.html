      <p>Payments giant Visa is pushing its agenda for electronic payments in Brazil and expects local usage of cash will significantly decrease within the next year.According to the company's country manager for Brazil, Fernando Teles, the company's ambition for the medium term is to achieve a result similar to that seen in developed markets, where 60% of payments on average are made through options such as digital wallets and contactless cards.</p>
      <p>“We are entering segments where, historically, money has always been dominant,” says Teles, referring to the introduction of contactless payments in the Rio de Janeiro metro system and the trials of the technology in the São Paulo bus network, which started in September.</p>
      <p>“When it comes to public transport, we are bringing improvements to the population and offering benefits to operators with the gradual removal of cash from their ecosystem, but the main goal is to introduce a change of habit,” the executive explains.</p>
      <p>Just as in markets such as the United Kingdom, the use of contactless in public transport in Brazil will be the main driver for greater acceptance of the method as an alternative to money, according to Teles.</p>
      <p>"There is an initial acceptance curve [for contactless], which later becomes quite steep, where people start not wanting to use money anymore," says Teles. He cites the example of Australia, a market where, according to Visa, contactless represents 92% of face-to-face electronic payments.</p>
      <p>The war on money in Brazil foresees a process similar to that of other developed markets, where according to Teles, a "significant change" in payment processes occurred within 18 months after the introduction of the technology.</p>
      <p>According to the executive, the decrease in the cost of the physical elements needed to leverage electronic payments is another factor that will make Brazilians use less and less cash.</p>
      <p>“The fact that the technology needed for contactless cards and terminals is becoming cheaper will bring contactless acceptance into the mainstream. This is exactly what happened in China. ”</p>
      <p>According to Teles, Visa's electronic payment pilots in places with low technological maturity across Brazil show that the method also plays a role of social change.</p>
      <p>“Reducing [transaction] costs through electronic means means more jobs are created and the economy improves, increasing the human development rate of cities and reducing violence. It is a virtuous circle. ”</p>
