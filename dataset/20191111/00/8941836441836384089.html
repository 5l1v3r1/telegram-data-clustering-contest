      <h1>Chase Young targeted by vindictive NCAA</h1>

        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you thought a kinder, gentler, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> was emerging as it moves toward allowing athletes to monetize their own likeness, name, and image, you’re not paying attention.</p>
      <p>The letters still stand for No Compassion At All and the organization’s paradigm remains intact, despite recent pressure and threats from a few legislative bodies. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> proved as much last week, flexing its misplaced muscles against potential No. 1 draft picks in the NFL and NBA.</p>
      <p>Ohio State defensive end <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chase-young/">Chase Young</a>, a DeMatha High graduate, didn’t get to enjoy taking on the familiar colors of an old hometown favorite Saturday when the hosting Buckeyes routed Maryland, 73-14.</p>

      <p>Young was held out of the game pending a possible <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> violation. He offered an explanation on Twitter: “I made a mistake last year by accepting a loan from a family friend I’ve known since the summer before my freshman year at OSU,” he tweeted. “I repaid it in full last summer and I’m working with the University and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> to get back on the field as soon as possible.”</p>
      <p>Unlike Ohio State, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> didn’t kowtow Friday when the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> deemed that star freshman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-wiseman/">James Wiseman</a> is “likely ineligible” to play because his family received some moving expenses two years ago. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> fought back right away. It obtained a temporary restraining order to delay the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> ruling and started <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-wiseman/">Wiseman</a> later that evening. The 7-foot-1 center recorded 17 points, nine rebounds and five blocks against Illinois-Chicago.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>The family’s relocation assistance in moving from Nashville to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> came from Penny Hardaway, then a local prep coach but now the university’s head coach. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> has viewed Hardaway as a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> booster since 2008, when the former NBA star donated $1 million to his alma mater for a new sports hall of fame.</p>
      <p>“Their finding is arbitrary and capricious based on the law and the way the bylaws are written,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-wiseman/">Wiseman</a> attorney Randy Fishman told The Athletic. “Nobody would’ve dreamed Penny would be the coach in 2019. He helped somebody out when he wasn’t the coach, not knowing he’d be the coach.”</p>
      <p>Young’s reported loan for a roundtrip ticket ($400?) to fly his girlfriend to the 2019 Rose Bowl, and the Wiseman family’s reported acceptance of $11,500 in moving expenses, indicate the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a>’s wide range in harassing players.</p>
      <p>The organization is neither fair nor reasonable in determining or enforcing its nonsensical policies.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>You mean to tell me that the entire multibillion-dollar enterprise was threatened because a friend loaned <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chase-young/">Young</a> a few hundred dollars? You want to argue that the playing field was unleveled because Hardaway gave relocation assistance in 2017 and subsequently coached <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-wiseman/">Wiseman</a> in high school?</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> and its proponents insist that college athletes and non-athletes should be viewed in the same light. But the athletes consistently are treated differently, with more scrutiny and less justice.</p>
        <p>Because money.</p>
        <p>When the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> announced last month that it was changing the policy on athletes’ names and images, Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) acted like the American way was under attack. “If college athletes are going to make money off their likenesses while in school, their scholarships should be treated like income,” Burr tweeted. “I’ll be introducing legislation that subjects scholarships given to athletes who choose to ‘cash in’ to income taxes.”</p>
        <p>Sure, let’s focus on athletic scholarships, which according to one study are given to less than 1.5% of undergraduate students.</p>
        <p>If you have an academic scholarship and also “cash in” off campus, that’s great. If you have a band scholarship and also receive personal loans, good for you. If you have any niche scholarship and someone gives your parents money for any reason, no problem.</p>
        <p>Young is facing a suspension that could sideline him for another few weeks. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> is risking forfeiture of every game <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-wiseman/">Wiseman</a> plays, in addition to sanctions against the school and Hardaway.</p>
        <p>Remind me again of the similarities between athletes and non-athletes.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> looks worse than before, an astonishing feat. Several statehouses around the country already looked askance at the organization before it came down on the star athletes for highly suspect reasons. Acting in typical heavy-handed fashion is a terrible way to engender goodwill given the current climate.</p>
        <p>Truth is, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> couldn’t care less about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chase-young/">Young</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jim-wiseman/">Wiseman</a>, penalizing players like them merely to keep member institutions in line. Ohio State played along. But <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/memphis/">Memphis</a> has rolled the dice in defiance, essentially telling the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> to go be intimate with itself.</p>
        <p>Forget about kinder and gentler. With cracks in the armor finally appearing, it’s time for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ncaa/">NCAA</a> to be smarter and wiser.</p>
        <p>Don’t hold your breath.</p>
