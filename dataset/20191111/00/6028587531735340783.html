      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/first-solar/"><b>First Solar’s</b></a><b> (NASDAQ: FSLR)</b> operating expenses have dropped significantly, from $3.47 billion in 2016 to $2.2 billion in 2018, primarily due to internal restructuring and a drop in cost of goods sold, due to a drop in revenue. First Solar’s revenue dropped from $2.9 billion in 2016 to $2.24 billion in 2018, as the company scaled back on its Series 4 modules, in order to ramp up production of Series 6 panels, which were launched earlier this year. Due to this switch, there was a high one-time restructuring cost (of around $800 million) at the end of FY ’16, and also a gradual increase in production start-up costs since 2016.You can view the Trefis interactive dashboard – <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/Kxb2jGFC/First-Solar-Breakdown-Of-Operating-Expenses?fromforbesandarticle=fslr191111"><b>First Solar: Breakdown Of Operating Expenses</b></a> – to better understand how the company’s operating expenses have moved over the years and what is causing this change.</p>

      <p>Following is how each expense head has moved over the years. For more details of each expense please visit our interactive Dashboard on <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/Kxb2jGFC/First-Solar-Breakdown-Of-Operating-Expenses?fromforbesandarticle=fslr191111"><b>First Solar’s Operating Expenses</b></a><b>:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Cost of goods sold</b>, which comes to about 82.5% of total revenue, makes up the manufacturing costs of solar panels and modules. COGS as a percentage of revenue has risen from 78% in 2016 to 82.5% in 2018, but we expect this to drop to around 71.5% by 2020, as the new series 6 modules are more cost-efficient to manufacture.</li>
        <li><b>Selling, general and administrative costs</b>, which stand at around 7.9% of total revenue, include any marketing and selling expenses, advertising costs and the cost of distributing the products. We expect this metric to rise in absolute terms, to about $221.4 million by 2020, but make up just 6.1% of total revenue, due to the expected rise in Series 6 sales.</li>
        <li><b>Research and development expenses</b> make up almost 4% of total revenue, and have dropped from $124.8 million in 2016 to $84.5 million in 2018. Since the Series 6 modules have only been recently launched, we expect this metric to make up just 2.2% of total revenue going into 2020.</li>
        <li><b>Production Start-up expenses</b>, which make up around 4% of total revenue in 2018, include any costs involved in the production of new technology. This metric rose from $1 million in 2016 to $90.7 million in 2019, as First Solar ramped up its Series 6 module production. After rising a little in 2019, we expect this metric to drop to around $75 million by 2020.</li>
        <li><b>Restructuring and asset impairment expenses</b> were a major part of operating expenses in 2016, standing at about $818.8 million. This included restructuring and asset impairment costs for the company, that came in the form of making the shift from Series 4 production to production of the new, more efficient Series 6 panels.</li>
