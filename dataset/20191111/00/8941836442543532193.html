      <p>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) - A Washington county plans to establish a mental health crisis stabilization unit based on a nearby center in Idaho, officials said.</p>
      <p>The North Idaho Crisis Center in Coeur D’Alene served about 1,400 people in 2018, enabling the clients to stay out of an emergency room or jail, The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/spokesman-review/">Spokesman-Review</a> reported Sunday.</p>
      <p>Spokane County studied the Coeur d’Alene center while planning its own facility, said Ariane Schmidt, city project manager for Spokane.</p>
      <p>The county Board of Commissioners is expected to vote Tuesday on whether to grant $350,000 to Pioneer Human Services to develop an operational framework for the proposed center.</p>
      <p>The Idaho center provides walk-in service to anyone suffering a mental health or substance use crisis. Employees help draft safety plans and make references to shelters, social services or higher-level care providers.</p>

      <p>More than 700 clients left the crisis center with individual plans, often to stay with a family member or somewhere they felt supported, officials said.</p>
      <p>The center remains open 24 hours and has not closed its doors since launching four years ago. The goal is “to provide basic stabilization and de-escalation services for somebody experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis,” said Don Robinson, the center’s crisis and intervention services manager.</p>
      <p>The center served 160 people last year who were not Idaho residents, a majority of those from Spokane County.</p>
      <p>“If somebody appears at our front door, and they are in a crisis, we will bring them in,” Robinson said. “The key priority is to make them safe.”</p>
