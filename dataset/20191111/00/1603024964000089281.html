      <p>Higher agriculture losses and flood claims across India pulled down the September quarter (Q2) numbers of reinsurer <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/diversified/generalinsurancecorporationindia/GIC12">General Insurance Corporation of India </a>(GIC Re) and pushed it into the red with Rs 595.45 crore net loss for the period.</p>
      <p>The reinsurer had posted a net profit of Rs 513.84 crore for the same quarter previous year.</p>
      <p>The underwriting losses increased to Rs 2,373.25 crore in Q2 compared to a loss of Rs 2,264.88 crore a year ago. Consequently, the combined ratio rose to 111.3 percent for H1FY20 compared to 110.3 percent in the year-ago period.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Combined ratio is a reflection of whether the premiums collected versus the claims paid. A ratio below 100 percent indicates that an insurer is making underwriting profit or in simple terms premiums and claims are proportional.</p>
      <p>All segments except motor insurance, other miscellaneous and personal accident posted an underwriting loss. The fire segment had the largest underwriting loss at Rs 1,315.88 crore.</p>
      <p>Similarly, agriculture insurance underwriting loss stood at Rs 307.89 crore in Q2 which is a direct reflection of the rise in crop claims in FY20. Last year, GIC Re had an underwriting profit of Rs 191.27 crore in the crop segment.</p>
      <p>A series of small and big cyclones, floods as well as heavy rainfall has increased the quantum of crop losses in FY20 by atleast 30 percent.</p>
      <p>GIC Re provides risk cover to the insurance companies providing policies to the farmers. Hence a rise in crop losses directly impacts the reinsurer's books.</p>
      <p>In comparison to the losses, the premium saw a single-digit growth in the September quarter.</p>
      <p>The net earned premium grew by 8.2 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 11,911.06 crore in the second quarter. GIC Re's total assetsÂ increased by 6.94 percent YoY to Rs 1.26 lakh crore at the end of September.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
