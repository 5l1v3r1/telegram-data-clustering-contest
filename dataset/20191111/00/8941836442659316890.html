      <p>PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) - New Hampshire officials are going to be reopening a bridge named after a Portsmouth man who died fighting during World War II.</p>
      <p>On Monday, officials are planning to reopen the George R. Laderbush Memorial Bridge, which carries motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic over the Route 1 bypass in Portsmouth.</p>
      <p>The opening of the bridge marks the completion of the New Hampshire Department of Transportation’s $20 Million U.S. Route 1 Bypass Bridge Replacement projects.</p>
      <p>The projects included the replacement removal and rehabilitation of a number of bridges on the New Hampshire side of the Sarah Mildred Long Bridge, which crosses the Piscataqua River between Portsmouth and Kittery, Maine.</p>
