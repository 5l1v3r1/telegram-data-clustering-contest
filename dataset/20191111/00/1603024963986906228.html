      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <h4>What are the factors that banks take into consideration while approving a housing loan?</h4>
      <p>There are several factors that banks take into account while approving a home loan application. The prime factor is your credit history which is determined by your credit score. If you have maintained a good credit score by paying all your EMIs and credit card bills on time, your application is more likely to be approved.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/javascript:;">Close<br/></a>Banks also take into account your income. So if your income in the last three years has shown an increasing trend, you are an ideal candidate for a loan. Apart from that the bank will also consider your age before approving a loan. If you too young (21 years old), your repayment capacity may be lower. Same goes for people nearing retirement. The bank may decide against your application in such cases. If you are an Indian resident, you are eligible for a higher loan amount than an NRI. If you do not have many dependants to your name and your spouse has a decent income, you will be eligible for higher loans.</p>
      <h4>Will I be eligible for a home loan if my credit score is low?</h4>
      <p>If your credit score is below 750, the bank is likely to reject your loan application. You can wait a few months to improve your credit score and apply again. It is advisable to first improve your credit score and then apply for a loan. Alternatively, you can apply for a joint loan with your spouse or parents who have a higher credit score and a constant source of income.</p>
      <p>Very rarely, some non-banking financial institutions offer loans to those with poor credit score. You can try to find such a lender. However, the interest rates charged by these lenders are steep. So be careful when you apply for a loan with a poor credit score.</p>
      <h4>Is a home loan same for a flat and a piece of land?</h4>
      <p>No. Technically speaking, loans for purchasing a flat and purchasing a piece of land are generally clubbed under the umbrella term of home loans. However, the two loans are different from each other. One if for purchasing a flat and the other is for purchasing a plot.</p>
      <p>When you take a loan to purchase a home, you are availing the home purchase loan. This loan is eligible for tax exemptions. The interest on this loan is eligible for deductions under section 24 of the Income Tax Act and the principal is eligible for deductions under section 80 C. If you wish to purchase a plot to build your house later, you have to get a loan for land purchase. This loan is not eligible for any kind of tax deductions.<a href="https://transactmoneycontrol.page.link/?link=https://transact.moneycontrol.com/ux/&amp;apn=com.nw18.android.fundscontrol&amp;ofl=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nw18.android.fundscontrol&amp;isi=1310527238&amp;ibi=com.nw18.ios.fundscontrol&amp;utm_source=Articles&amp;utm_campaign=MF_PF_Articles&amp;efr=1">You can now invest in mutual funds with moneycontrol.
