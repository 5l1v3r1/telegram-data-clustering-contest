      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Two Maine artists have been commissioned to design a $1 million permanent art installation for a new convention center in Seattle.</p>
      <p>The Portland Press Herald reports Wade Kavanaugh, of Bethel, and Stephen Nguyen, of Portland, will create the installation for the Washington State Convention Center.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh and Nguyen are two of 18 artists that have been commissioned to create artwork for the building.</p>
      <p>The Maine pair is working with an $800,000 budget for their specific project. An additional $200,000 has been allocated for necessary architectural changes.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh says the two spent a few days in Washington state to “get a sense of the landscape” as they design their piece.</p>
