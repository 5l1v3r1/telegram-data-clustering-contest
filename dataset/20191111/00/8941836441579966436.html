      <p>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s president is making a new pitch to hard-liners to stay in the country’s unraveling 2015 nuclear deal with world powers: the chance to buy and sell weapons abroad next year.</p>
      <p>President Hassan Rouhani made the comments in a speech Monday in Rafsanjan in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s southwest Kerman province.</p>
      <p>Rouhani said: “If we save the nuclear deal, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a>’s arms embargo will be lifted and we can buy weapons or sell our weapons to the world. This is one of the deal’s significant impacts.”</p>
      <p>The end of the weapons embargo, imposed by the United Nations, already worries the Trump administration.</p>

        <p>All this comes a year after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the deal. In the time since, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/iran/">Iran</a> has begun breaking limits imposed by the deal to pressure Europe.</p>
