      <p>Friday afternoon, Green Bay Packers head coach Matt LaFleur stood before the assembled media and said, “The team that we’re about to play, they’re as good as anybody. And so, we’re going to have to bring our best.”They did.</p>
      <p>Green Bay defeated visiting Carolina, 24-16. And while the Packers didn’t play their best game of the year, they played extremely well against one of the NFC’s better outfits.</p>
      <p>The Packers won the turnover battle, 2-0. Green Bay ran for 163 yards and had three rushing touchdowns. And Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey, who leads the league in yards from scrimmage, didn’t kill the Packers.</p>
      <p>Green Bay improved to 8-2 and heads to its bye week with the second-best record in the NFC.</p>
      <p>Here’s the good, bad and ugly from the Packers’ win over the Panthers (5-4).</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE GOOD</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>AARON JONES: </b>Green Bay’s third-year running back continued his breakout season Sunday.</p>
      <p>Jones ran for 93 yards on just 13 carries (7.2) and scored three rushing touchdowns, marking the second time this year he’s had at last three TDs in a game. The last Packer with three touchdowns in multiple games in the same season came in 1962, when Jim Taylor did it three times.</p>
      <p>Jones now has 14 touchdowns through 10 games, which is tied for the most in team history with Taylor (1962) and Ahman Green (2003).</p>
      <p><b>BEND, BUT DON’T BREAK: </b>Green Bay’s defense gave up 401 total yards and 26 first downs. But the Packers had two huge turnovers to stymie the Panthers and stopped Christian McCaffrey inches short of the goal line on the final play of the game.</p>
      <p>Carolina led, 10-7, early in the second quarter when it drove to Green Bay’s 46. On a second-and-1, quarterback Kyle Allen fumbled after a sloppy exchange with center Matt Paradis and Packers defensive end Montravius Adams recovered.</p>
      <p>Then early in the third quarter with Green Bay leading, 21-10, Carolina drove to the Packers’ 11. Allen tried fitting the ball into a tight window to wideout Jarius Wright, but Packers’ safety Adrian Amos tipped the pass and cornerback Tramon Williams intercepted.</p>
      <p>Instead of the Panthers pulling within one score, the Panthers took over and drove for a field goal that gave them a commanding 24-10 lead.</p>
      <p>Carolina then drove to Green Bay’s 2-yard line with 4 seconds left. The Panthers gave the ball to McCaffrey, one of the frontrunners for league MVP honors. But Green Bay outside linebacker Preston Smith met McCaffrey in the hole and stopped him inches shy of a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Game, set, match Green Bay.</p>
      <p><b>RUN TO DAYLIGHT: </b>Green Bay ran just 11 times for 45 yards in a 26-11 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers last week. Packers coach Matt Lafleur admitted he made a major mistake abandoning the run after Green Bay fell in an early hole.</p>
      <p>Not this week.</p>
      <p>Green Bay ran the ball 27 times for 163 yards, an average of 6.0 yards per carry. The Packers’ commitment to the running game helped them balance the offense and defeat a solid Carolina team.</p>
      <p><b>PRESTON SMITH: </b>Smith, who signed a four-year, $52 million deal with Green Bay in March, established a new career-high with his ninth sack of the season. Smith posted eight-sack seasons twice during his four years in Washington, but has already eclipsed those totals.</p>
      <p><b>THE WEATHER:</b> Late in the first quarter, the snow started falling at Lambeau Field and it continued the next 2 ½ hours. What the Packers and Panthers experienced was a snow globe game that made fascinating viewing for a national television audience.</p>
      <p>For most of the night, the snow simply made the field slick. By the fourth quarter, though, the snow was sticking and players were slipping all over the place.</p>
      <p>Yes, the weather made things tough at times. But for fans and viewers alike, it made for a memorable game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE BAD</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>DECISIONS, DECISIONS:</b> The Packers drove to the Carolina 1-yard-line with just 2 seconds left in the first half. Green Bay head coach Matt LaFleur bypassed the field goal, and with a 14-10 lead, elected to go for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>The Packers lined up with a jumbo package and gave the ball to running back Jamaal Williams. Panthers defensive end Gerald McCoy whipped left tackle David Bakhtiari, though, and buried Williams for a 3-yard loss to end the half.</p>
      <p>LaFleur made an emotional decision to bypass a chip-shot field goal, and it blew up on him and the Packers.</p>
      <p><b>DEFENDING TIGHT ENDS:</b> The Packers have struggled defending tight ends all season, and Sunday was no different.</p>
      <p>Carolina veteran Greg Olsen established a season-high with eight receptions. And Olsen’s 98 receiving yards were his second-most of the year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE UGLY</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>OFFICIATING:</b> A phantom roughing the passer call on Carolina’s Gerald McCoy. Invisible pass interference calls on Green Bay wide receivers Davante Adams and Allen Lazard.</p>
      <p>The officiating in this once great sport has hit an all-time low. And Sunday was just another example of the mess the league has.</p>
      <p>McCoy was flagged after a clean hit on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers to keep one Packers’ drive alive. Two Green Bay receivers were flagged for pass interference despite making almost no contact with Carolina defenders.</p>
      <p>Week after week, these part time employees continue to make critical mistakes. And until the league fixes it, the paying customers and viewing audience have every reason to be outraged.</p>
