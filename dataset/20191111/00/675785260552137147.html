      <h1>Shop workers are threatened and assaulted once a fortnight by angry customers</h1>
      <h2>Retail workers are suffering at the hands of furious customers as unions call for urgent action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:01:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Ellis, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-ellis/</a></address>
      <p>Around 400 assaults are taking place every day against Britain’s shop workers.</p>
      <p>Retail staff face soaring fury over sales of age-restricted goods such as booze, cigarettes and knives, as well as being harassed by drunks and drug addicts.</p>
      <p>A shock survey shows each worker is verbally abused, threatened or assaulted around 21 times a year. The Mirror has seen the early findings from the shop workers’ union USDAW’s Freedom from Fear survey of more than 4,000 staff.</p>
      <p>Assaults are up by a third on last year with staff being headbutted, kicked, threatened with blades and syringes, groped, flashed at and stabbed with keys.</p>
      <p>Paddy Lillis, of USDAW, said: “The statistics show urgent action is required.”</p>
      <p>Pat Gibbons, 59, who was stunned by the violence she met in a shop after being a barmaid and a taxi driver in Liverpool, said: “There is no fear and no respect.”</p>
