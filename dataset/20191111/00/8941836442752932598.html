      <p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A judge has set a sentencing date later this month for an Ohio man convicted of killing two suburban police officers responding to a 911 hang-up call.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/quentin-smith/">Quentin Smith</a> was found guilty Nov. 1 of two counts of aggravated murder for fatally shooting Westerville officers Eric Joering and Anthony Morelli in February 2018.</p>
      <p>A divided jury on Nov. 6 recommended life with no parole over a death sentence. Judge Richard Frye will formally pass sentence <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/quentin-smith/">Smith</a> on Nov. 21. He can’t override the jury.</p>
      <p>Franklin County prosecutors said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/quentin-smith/">Smith</a> killed the officers in an exchange of gunfire after opening his apartment door. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/quentin-smith/">Smith</a> was shot five times.</p>

        <p>Defense attorney Frederick Benton didn’t dispute that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/quentin-smith/">Smith</a> shot the officers, but said it happened in “a moment of chaos, panic and crisis.”</p>
