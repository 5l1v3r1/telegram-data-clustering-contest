      <h1>It’s Time to Retire the Phrase: “Don’t Boil the Ocean”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">David Benjamin and David Komlos</a></address>
      <p>Everyone in business has heard the warning: “<i>don’t boil the ocean.</i>” In other words, when looking for a solution to a problem, don’t take on too much all at once or make the scope so big that it becomes difficult or even impossible to find an answer. Whether the phrase was first uttered by Will Rodgers, or Mark Twain, or Lewis Carroll (you can find all three named as sources), business people have adopted it as a universal truth, and we’ve been stuck with it ever since. Now, it’s time to get unstuck and retire the phrase altogether, because when it comes to problem-solving, “don’t boil the ocean” is terrible advice. In business, the phrase suggests that you should keep the scope of your problem-solving narrow, focus on smaller bits at a time rather than the whole, and not get too wrapped up in details across a broad array of considerations. However, when it comes to solving big problems in business, the opposite is true. In order to solve your biggest, most complex problems, you <i>must </i>boil the ocean. </p>

      <p>Every problem falls into two categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mechanistic (or “complicated”) problems that are 100% solvable by someone with the right expertise or technical skill. These are problems like repairing a car or installing a new software system; and</li>
        <li>Interconnected, dynamically changing, non-deterministic (or “complex”) problems whose solutions can only be guessed at and shown to work in retrospect through trial-and-error. These are problems like doubling your business, fending off a competitive threat, or transforming a customer experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With <i>complicated</i> problems, it’s often true that you shouldn’t try to boil the ocean. These problems are more straightforward, so you can afford to limit your focus to only a critical few areas, break big things down into smaller parts, identify a tighter scope, and rein in any attempt to expand it.</p>
      <p>When you are implementing a Customer Relationship Management system, for example, engage the right partner, give them the information they need, make clear what’s most urgent to roll out first (accounts and existing pipeline now, campaign management later), and keep a careful eye out for scope creep. That just makes sense. </p>
      <p>With complex problems, however, limiting things in this way will backfire. It’s critical to boil the ocean, because: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>You can’t limit your focus to only a few critical areas.</b> With complex problems, you don’t know what’s critical and you don’t know how those areas might be connected to each other. For example, a technology company that thinks it needs to reset its marketing strategy in light of a competitive threat may be dealing with a bigger problem: employee morale has been low since the company suffered its first significant market share loss in years. </li>
        <li><b>You can’t make progress on parts in isolation. </b>While it’s tempting to break a big, complex problem into smaller parts and tackle them in isolation, one by one<b>, </b>this will fail because different facets aren’t actually isolated from each other and doing something to one may well have an unforeseen and unintended impact on another. For example, deciding to make price cuts in an online retail channel may undermine the sales-plus-service pricing of a related but different product line in a wholesale channel.</li>
        <li><b>You can’t pick a scope in advance and shut down anyone who strays from scope.</b> With complex problems, no one knows at the start where the answers lie, what matters and what doesn’t matter, and where potential discoveries, insights, and dead ends await. For example, in a conversation about becoming more customer-centric, is a topic about Customer Relationship Management technology important or unimportant? In some situations, it might be best to leave technology out of it and talk about the idealized customer experience. In other situations, it might be critical to understand in advance what technology is available. The point is that you don’t know what matters, and you might miss something key if you are inflexibly coloring within the lines. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Pick the right approach for the problem at hand</h3>
      <p>In complicated situations, don’t boil the ocean.</p>
      <p>In high-variety, highly complex situations, boiling the ocean is your only viable option. Involve a high-variety group made up of stakeholders, decision-makers, doers, influencers, partners, and even customers in the search for answers. Instead of interviewing them and keeping them apart, put them in direct and intense contact with each other for a few days, have them first align on what they need to discuss, and then drive them to figure things out as they explore those topics together.</p>
      <p>Maybe that sounds like what you’ve been told <i>not</i> to do. A large group of people, working through a broad and self-set agenda, letting the conversation take them wherever they need to go, and being open-minded and excited about what emerges runs counter to traditional advice about problem-solving in meetings. But that’s what works when confronting complexity. If you don’t boil the ocean, you’re not going to solve anything big.</p>
      <p>Which is precisely why we should stop telling people it’s wrong.</p>
