      <p>CAIRO (AP) - Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities says local archeologists have unearthed the mummy of an unusually large animal, most likely a lion or lioness.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egypts-ministry-of-antiquities/">ministry</a> said on Monday the mummy was excavated in Saqqara, a town south of Cairo that was a vast necropolis in antiquity and is home to the famed Step Pyramid.</p>
      <p>Archeologists frequently find mummified cats but the recovery of a lion is rare. In 2004, the first lion skeleton was found, revealing the sacred status of the animal during ancient times.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/egypts-ministry-of-antiquities/">ministry</a> says it will expand on the discovery at a press conference after running radar scans.</p>
