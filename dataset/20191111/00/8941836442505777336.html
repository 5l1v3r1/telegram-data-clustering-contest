      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hawaii-department-of-transportation/">Hawaii Department of Transportation</a> says it plans to use a new type of asphalt that could extend road life by years.</p>
      <p>KHON-TV reported stone matrix asphalt may reduce the need for filling potholes, fixing cracks and performing other types of regular road maintenance.</p>
      <p>Officials say the stronger and more flexible compound could last up to 25 years.</p>
      <p>Officials say a repaving project on Oahu’s Pali Highway has added a layer of stone matrix asphalt on top of standard asphalt to make the road smoother and more durable.</p>
      <p>Transportation officials plan to expand use of the asphalt hybrid to various major road arteries.</p>
