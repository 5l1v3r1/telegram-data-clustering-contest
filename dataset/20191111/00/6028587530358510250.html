      <p>Jamal Adams caused some off-the-field drama recently. But the on-field drama Adams supplied Sunday showed why he just might be worth the occasional headaches he can bring.</p>
      <p>Adams simply was the best player on either team as he helped the struggling New York Jets to a satisfying 34-27 victory over the equally-in-distress New York Giants.</p>
      <p>Adams had nine tackles, including eight solos, two sacks, two forced fumbles and a game-changing touchdown. In fact, Jets coach Adam Gase said afterward that Adams basically called his shot before his amazing strip sack in which he literally stole the ball from rookie quarterback Daniel Jones.</p>
      <p>Gase said, “(Adams) said he was going to do it before he went out there. I (then) saw him in the end zone and said, ‘Well, I guess he was right.’ He was talking on the sidelines like ‘I’m going to make a turnover. I’m going to get a turnover.’ He was right.”</p>
      <p>Adams said, “I told him I’m going to make the turnover. It’s going to be special. Obviously, that’s just my mindset, that’s how I go out every Sunday. ...</p>
      <p>The blitzing Adams’ other strip sack of Jones wasn’t recovered by the Jets, but the play pushed the Giants back to their own 7 and set up the Jets’ second TD.</p>
      <p>“I’m trying to be the best in the field,” Adams said, “trying to be the best in the league, whatever it is, and I just hold myself to that high regard.”</p>
      <p>No, one game isn’t a referendum, just as one victory does not prove that Gase is the right coach to lead the injury-plagued Jets out of the wilderness.</p>
      <p>But for at least one day, Adams lived up to his recent quote comparing himself to living legend Tom Brady and perennial Pro Bowler Aaron Donald, when he noted the Patriots weren’t taking calls inquiring about their availability in a trade. And even after the very public spat he had with Jets’ management because general manager Joe Douglas had the audacity, in Adams’ mind, to listen to those offers for Adams’ services at the NFL trade deadline, this game demonstrated why the 2017 first-round draft pick is well worth holding onto.</p>
      <p>The Jets will have to begin to decide during the off-season whether they view Adams as part of their long-term future, and if he plays for the rest of 2019 at anywhere near the level he showed against the Giants, it will be an easy decision. By May 3, the Jets must pick up or decline the fifth-year option on Adams’ contract.</p>
      <p>Based on this projection for 2020 of a $10.771 million fifth-year option salary for NFL safeties, it’s possible the 2021 figure would be north of $11 million thanks to some of the recent mega-deals given to safeties Earl Thomas (Baltimore) and Landon Collins (Washington).</p>
      <p>Still, for the Jets to keep Adams in the fold beyond 2021, he likely will want something similar to those aforementioned mega contracts. But picking up that option at least would buy the the Jets some time to try to get a long-term deal done with Adams if they so choose.</p>
      <p>The player everyone saw Sunday certainly is worthy of a lucrative contract. The trick for Adams, or anyone, is to do it consistently.</p>
      <p>“I know what to expect from my play when I do it the right way,” Adams said, “when I do what I'm asked to do on the field by my coaches. This is nothing, man. This is just the start.”</p>
      <p>He has seven more games this season to prove that to the Jets.</p>
