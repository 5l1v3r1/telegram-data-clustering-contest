      <p>WELLFLEET, Mass. (AP) - The season’s first cold-stunned sea turtles were rescued from Cape Cod beaches over the weekend.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Mass Audubon’s Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary says juvenile Kemp’s ridley turtles were found Saturday at beaches in Brewster and Eastham. A third was found Sunday on Great Island in Wellfleet.</p>
      <p>The ridleys, the world’s most endangered sea turtles, were taken to the New England Aquarium’s animal care facility in Quincy for medical care and rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>A green turtle was found dead Saturday morning in Eastham.</p>
      <p>The turtle strandings are an annual event on Cape Cod as the reptiles suffer hypothermia-like symptoms when the weather and water turn cooler.</p>
