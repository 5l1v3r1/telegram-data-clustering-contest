      <h1>NFL draft order: Redskins benefit during bye as other bad teams win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/adam-zielonka/" target="_blank">Adam Zielonka</a></address>
      <p>Week 10 was a topsy-turvy one in the NFL, with the likes of the Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints taking losses and some of the league’s poorer teams finding ways to win.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most surprising thing of all is the Miami Dolphins’ two-game winning streak. What once was a team destined for the No. 1 overall draft pick next April might not even crack the top five by season’s end.</p>
      <p>In fact, the Washington Redskins have a little more “breathing room” in the draft order race now that the Dolphins upset the Colts, the New York Jets beat the New York Giants and the Atlanta Falcons toppled the Saints. Those three results mean Washington is the only one-win team remaining in the league.</p>
      <p>Their position in the draft order remained the same — second — and they’re still behind the worst team in the league, the Cincinnati Bengals, who already have turned to rookie backup quarterback Ryan Finley and just received a shellacking against Baltimore.</p>
      <p>The Bengals have dates with the Jets and Dolphins, plus two with the 3-6 Cleveland Browns, still ahead; if they manage to win a few of those, the Redskins could land in the driver’s seat for the first overall pick, something they haven’t owned since 1962.</p>
