      <p>PRESIDENT Duterte has called on winners of this year’s Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA) to “take this occasion to reflect on how the various forms of media affect the character formation of our people, especially the youth.”</p>
      <p>In a message to the CMMA on its 41st anniversary and awards presentation on November 13, Duterte also commended the awards body for promoting and upholding “the highest standards in traditional and social media in the Philippines through its well-regarded awarding ceremonies.”</p>
      <p>The CMMA’s “consistent efforts to honor organizations and practitioners who create truthful, responsible and values-laden communication materials are truly inspiring,” Duterte added.</p>
      <p>With the mass media’s commitment to nation-building,  he said, “we will achieve and stronger and brighter future for all Filipinos.”</p>
      <p>The CMMA awards night will be held at the GSIS Theater, GSIS Headquarters, Financial Center, Roxas Boulevard, Pasay City. The program starts at 5 p.m., with the registration of finalists for  the awards, CMMA judges and board of trustees members, church leaders and other guests.</p>
      <p>The CMMA was established in 1978 by the late Jaime L. Cardinal Sin, who was the Archbishop of Manila then, as the means by which the Archdiocese of Manila recognizes “those who are serving God through the mass media.”</p>
      <p>Through its more than four decades, CMMA has become a tradition and a prestigious event joined by some of the country’s most respected personalities in the fields of television, radio, print media, music, cinema, the Internet, as well as by students from various academic institutions vying for the Student CMMA, through the years.</p>
      <p>The CMMA is headed by D. Edgard A. Cabangon  as acting chairman of the CMMA Foundation board of trustees, Luis Antonio G. Cardinal Tagle as honorary chairman, and Rev. Fr. Rufino C. Secson Jr. as executive director.</p>
