      <p>SPORT can change lives and the work of Scottish Sports Futures has inspired thousands of young people to make positive lifestyle choices.</p>
      <p>Now the charity is set to host its first fundraising Sports Dinner, marking more than 20 years of supporting young people across Scotland.</p>
      <p>Join top football raconteur John Gahagan and Peter Martin as the event, which is set to become one of the sporting dinner events of the year.</p>
      <p>Host Peter Martin will keep guests laughing and on the edge of their seats as they enjoy a delicious three course meal whilst John Gahagan will entertain with his hilarious stories - not for the faint hearted - about sport and life as a footballer.</p>
      <p>A live auction and raffle with fabulous prizes will support the work of SSF and corporate partner Barclays has pledged to match all money raised on the night through the Barclays employees’ volunteers.</p>
      <p>Tables of 10 costs £600 and the event will take place at 200 St Vincent Street, Glasgow on 7 December.</p>

      <p>Scottish Sports Futures (SSF) work to tackle poverty and inequality through building skills, capacity and resilience, using a youth work person centred approach. </p>
      <p>In the last year the charity has worked with 8000 young people living in deprivation and facing challenges such as poverty, lack of aspiration and poor mental health.</p>
      <p>The charity has also supported young people to gain accreditation, complete training and become volunteers.</p>
      <p>In the last year they have provided 21,561 hours of volunteering which equates to £194,049 national living wage equivalent.</p>
      <p>Last year 96% of young people reported an increase in skills, 89% reported increased confidence, and 80% increased aspiration.</p>

      <p>Andrew Marley, SSF Youth Director at SSF, said: “This is an amazing charity which continues to keep young people at the heart of all it does.</p>
      <p>“I have seen the transformation which SSF has made on many other young people, lives which would be very different and a lot less positive without the work we do.</p>
      <p>“All this work would not be possible without the support of many different people so please book your tickets to our Sports Dinner in December”.</p>
      <h3>Case study</h3>
      <p>W was a shy, reserved young person, lacking in confidence, when he first joined the SSF champion programme.</p>
      <p>He attended the Active East residential where he started to come out of his shell and meet new people and since then he has gone from strength to strength.</p>
      <p>Now he is constantly beaming, he attends every volunteer event and is completing qualifications.</p>
      <p>Now he volunteers twice weekly, supporting young people and families to become healthier and more active.</p>
      <p>During the summer he dedicated 10 hours each week to delivering the programme in the Cranhill area, working with up to 40 young people each day and their families.</p>
      <p>He is so dedicated and committed to his volunteering and is the first to arrive at every session and the last to leave.</p>
      <p>He is a fantastic role model to the children and delivers fun and accessible activity sessions for the participants.</p>
      <p>A year ago, he wouldn’t have stood up and delivered engaging sessions to young people weekly or flown to Berlin to be part of young people’s steering group.</p>
      <p>All W wants to do is help people and to make a difference - and he most certainly is doing this.</p>
