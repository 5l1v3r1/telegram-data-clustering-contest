      <p>The value of a college education continues to be a hot topic, debated by policy makers and pondered by students and families. These days, a popular measure of that value is to compare the earnings of individuals who’ve earned a college degree to those who haven’t. Another measure - increasingly invoked in college rating schemes such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2019/08/15/forbes-releases-annual-ranking-of-americas-top-colleges/#519e4499924f"><i>Forbes</i></a> or by policy organizations like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/topic/higher-education/">Brookings</a> and <a href="https://opportunityinsights.org/">The Equality of Opportunity Project </a>that track college-related social mobility - is to compare the earnings of students who attended one college versus another.</p>
      <p>Two widely used alumni earnings databases are the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/">Department of Education’s College Scorecard</a> and <a href="https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report">PayScale’s College Salary Report</a>. These websites are scoured by students and families evaluating their college options relative to future earnings potential. They’re relied on by researchers studying economic inequalities and socio-economic mobility. And they’re referenced by both college leaders and elected officials to justify various educational initiatives.</p>
      <p>How comparable are these two databases? Would a prospective student reach the same conclusion about the payoff from attending Notre Dame if she consulted Scorecard or PayScale? How different would a university’s ROI look to a trustee, depending on which data source he used?</p>
      <p>It turns out the methodologies behind the two databases are very different in four major ways so it should come as no surprise that the earnings estimates vary considerably - sometimes dramatically - depending on which source is used.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Scope of Included Institutions</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maintained by the Department of Education, the Scorecard includes all degree-granting, Title IV colleges (where students are eligible to receive federal grants or loans) and some schools closely approximating Title IV institutions.</p>
      <p>In earlier years of its Salary Report, PayScale’s sample was criticized for being too small and unrepresentative. PayScale claims that its 2019-20 survey has now grown to a sample of 3.5 million respondents, representing more than 4,000 degree-granting colleges.</p>
      <p>S<b>ource of the Data</b></p>
      <p>The College Scorecard relies on the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/">Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS)</a> for much of its data. It gathers students’ earnings data from de-identified tax records and then aggregates them at the institutional level.</p>
      <p>PayScale is a voluntary system where individuals complete an online survey and self-report their earnings and other data.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Students Included</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Scorecard collects data only on students who receive federal financial aid, a group likely to be less economically secure than students who aren’t eligible for such support. In addition, the Scorecard includes salaries for undergraduates who attended a given college, regardless of whether they graduated, dropped out, or transferred to another institution.</p>
      <p>PayScale, on the other hand, includes only students who completed their bachelor’s (or associate’s) degree, and it doesn’t limit its sample to recipients of federal aid.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Time Period Covered</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Scorecard provides earnings estimates for a 6-10 year time period after a student’s attendance at given school. Typically, it is described as being a ten-year figure.</p>
      <p>PayScale reports salaries for two time periods: an <i>early-career</i> salary (average post-graduation interval: three years) and a <i>mid-career </i>salary (average interval: 15.5 years).</p>
      <p><b>How Do The Differences Matter</b>?</p>
      <p>As an illustration of how such methodological differences matter, consider the median earnings attributed to students from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/#1f4992eb1987"><i>Forbes</i> top 25 colleges</a>.</p>
      <p>The median mid-career salary for bachelor’s degree students, according to PayScale was $130,500 at Notre Dame (ranging from $112,200 at the University of Michigan to $158,200 at Harvey Mudd). The median early-career salary was $70,700 at the University of California-Berekely (ranging from $63,400 at Northwestern to $88,800 at Harvey Mudd).</p>
      <p>Using the Scorecard, the median earnings was Dartmouth’s $75,500, with a range from Swarthmore’s $56,700 to MIT’s $104,700.</p>
      <p>As would be expected, given the overlap in time frames, Scorecard figures are more comparable to PayScale’s early-career figures. But even here, the variations are considerable. In eight cases, PayScale’s early-career median was greater than the Scorecard’s, by an average of $4,738.</p>
      <p>Princeton: $75,20o (PayScale) vs. $74,700 (Scorecard)</p>
      <p>Brown: $68,200 vs. $67,500</p>
      <p>Pomona College: $63,800 vs. $58,100</p>
      <p>U. California-Berkeley: $$70,700 vs. $64,700</p>
      <p>Williams College: $67,500 vs. $59,000</p>
      <p>U. Michigan: $63,500 vs. $63,400</p>
      <p>Rice: $71,000 vs. $65,400</p>
      <p>Swarthmore: $67,500 vs. $56,700</p>
      <p>Harvey Mudd’s average salary was the same in both databases - $88,800. Across the remaining 15 comparisons (there were no Scorecard data for the Naval Academy), Scorecard’s median earnings exceeded PayScale’s early-career salary by an average of $11,900.</p>
      <p>Harvard: $89,700 (Scorecard) vs. $74,800 (PayScale)</p>
      <p>Stanford: $94,000 vs. $79,000</p>
      <p>Yale: $83,200 vs. $70,300</p>
      <p>MIT: $104,700 vs. $86,300</p>
      <p>U. Pennsylvania: $85,900 vs. $72,800</p>
      <p>California Institute of Technology: $85,900 vs. $84,100</p>
      <p>Duke: $84,400 vs. $71,100</p>
      <p>Dartmouth: $75,500 vs. $71,500</p>
      <p>Cornell: $77,200 vs. $70,100</p>
      <p>Columbia: $$83,300 vs. $71,400</p>
      <p>Georgetown: $93,500 vs. $66,400</p>
      <p>U. Chicago: $68,100 vs. $64,000</p>
      <p>Northwestern: $69,100 vs. $63,400</p>
      <p>Notre Dame: $$78,400 vs. $67,000</p>
      <p>Johns Hopkins: $73,200 vs. $67,200</p>
      <p>Given the differences in source, scope, sample and timing, differences between College Scorecard and PayScale estimates of college student earnings are to be expected. But the differences - even when restricted to similar time intervals - are often striking. Georgetown University’s Scorecard median is a whopping $27,100 greater than PayScale’s; MIT’s Scorecard median is $18,400 greater than its PayScale number. At Swarthmore, the reverse is true: PayScale’s estimate exceeds the Scorecard’s by $10,800; at Williams the difference is $8,500.</p>
      <p>Alumni compensation is just one consideration in choosing where to attend college. But it’s a contributing factor to many decisions. Consumers are therefore advised to consult both sources for estimates of future earnings potential and to remember the limitations of each one.</p>
