      <h1>Mindset Matters: Caroline Casey, The Valuable 500 And The Inclusion Revolution</h1>

      <p>Caroline Casey is truly a rare breed, whether you see her as an activist, agitator or cultural warrior she is a woman on a mission to place disability as a central responsibility of any corporate agenda. Through the creation of the Valuable 500, Casey is helping to define a global movement illustrating that disability is a critical tool for business leadership. As the Valuable 500 website states, “We need 500 national and multinational, private sector corporations to be the tipping-point for change and to unlock the business, social and economic value of people living with disabilities across the world. Because the potential of 1.3 billion should not be ignored.”What Caroline Casey genuinely understands is that the next phase of the disability inclusion journey within the business ecosystem is no longer focused solely on employment, but rather is expressed by a revolution of thought where bona fide leaders need to see disability inclusion through a much broader lens that is essential to the development of their organization and a cornerstone for driving economic growth. Through the Valuable 500 she is guiding companies to act and embrace this new business philosophy. By focusing on getting 500 corporations to join this campaign the goal is to help develop a structure of accountability amongst corporate leaders to see the inherent value that disability can play across the business landscape.</p>
      <p>  Casey is representing the evolution of disability leadership for the 21st century moving beyond a civil rights approach to an individual who has a keen awareness of the world around them and a more sophisticated understanding of the intersectionality of business, policy and culture and the impact that it plays on daily organizational life. It is this thinking along with the idea of an inclusion revolution that moves the needle forward and provides a template into what is needed to make disability part of the fabric of any business.</p>
      <p>Aside from Casey herself, the Valuable 500 campaign as a movement is a departure from causes that were led by non-profits of the past. Rather than seeing things from a perspective of need, the Valuable 500 illustrates the power of disability not only in the conversation of diversity but also the economic potential that it can serve as a value add and futurist model to see the growth of businesses from numerous avenues and a glimpse that the power of a community can be a win for all.  Currently the campaign has been based in Europe, however, the message resonates across geographic boundaries and the Valuable 500 as a movement can serve as a model that can have a global footprint creating a ripple effect that will have an enormous impact from multinational corporations down to start ups.</p>
      <p>Caroline Casey and the Valuable 500 are revolutionizing the way we are expanding the narrative of disability in real time. Casey and the campaign have understood that taking a story that resonates is essential for developing the building blocks to create a new picture of disability in the context of business. Layering that with smart marketing strategies and cutting-edge public relations techniques the Valuable 500 has made something that was invisible visible creating an environment to build a robust coalition of numerous stakeholders from businesses, advisors and other experts and allies.  Casey has a skilled understanding of who and what she needs to build a powerful sphere of influence to assemble the Valuable 500 beyond a new business model and create a movement that is larger than her so that it will take on a life of its own. That is her and the Valuable 500’s brilliance, the ability to transcend business tropes and evolve organically.</p>
      <p>Like many great leaders, Caroline Casey has an acute awareness that her legacy will far outlast her. However, her strength and drive will be a beacon not only for future leaders within the business and disability communities, but for those who believe that like the mythology of old, sometimes you have to write a new and have a fresh perspective for the world to come. Caroline Casey has developed a mechanism to harness the power of disability and refine it new ways that is essential for the growth of business in the digital age.</p>
