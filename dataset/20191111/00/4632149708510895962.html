      <h1>Puneeth Rajkumar's boxing sequence with Dhananjaya is the highlight of Yuvarathnaa: Santhosh Ananddram</h1>

      <p>Director Santhosh Ananddram has set the buzz roaring about <i>Yuvarathnaa</i> once again by announcing a set-piece fight sequence between Puneeth Rajkumar and Dhananjaya in the film. This will be a boxing sequence between the two actors and sources say this could be the epic fight in the climax. <br/><br/>This will not be the first time Puneeth will have to fight it out in the ring in a film's climax. He played a boxer in Maurya where boxing was the entire backdrop of the story. Dhananjay on the other hand played the protagonist in the film Boxer. The teaser of Yuvarathnaa showcased Puneeth playing rugby in what was depicted as a college rivalry. It has been officially announced that Puneeth will be playing a college student for at least a part of the film. It is the latest boxing angle that has come as a big surprise. <br/><br/>Untitled Carousel</p>

Three more films made under the PRK Productions will release this year itself. The big news is Puneeth himself acting in an upcoming home banner film. After a music and production company, he also has plans for setting up a distribution network for films. <br/><br/>Yuvarathnaa with an ensemble cast that includes Dhananjaya, Vasishta N Simha, Diganth, Prajaksh Raj and Saikumar among others is speculated to have an early 2020 release though no official date has been announced. While leading lady Sayyeshaa, body-builder Mamatha Sanathkumar and Bomman Irani are making their Sandalwood debuts with this film, Radhika Sarathkumar returns to Kannada after three decades. <br/><br/>Santhosh Ananddram has left no stone unturned to up the ante when it comes to this film. Each of his previous two films became the highest grosser after release. The Puneeth Rajkumar-Ananddram combination returns after Rajakumaara, which released in March 2017. The new film is therefore speculated to release to mark the third anniversary of that film. <br/><br/><br/>Untitled Carousel</p>
