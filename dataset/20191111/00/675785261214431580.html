      <h1>Declan Donnelly reduced to tears at performance of song played at dad's funeral</h1>
      <h2>Ant &amp; Dec's DNA Journey saw the pair travel to Ireland, where an emotion-heavy performance saw Dec shed a few tears</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T00:48:07+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 00:48</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>The intensely emotional Ant &amp; Dec's DNA Journey followed the pair as they traced back their ancestry and chatted candidly about the ups and downs of their lives.</p>
      <p>Ant even spoke openly about his time in rehab and the rough couple of years he had - but it was something else entirely that reduced presenting partner Dec to tears.</p>
      <p>During a segment in which both were found to have Irish ancestry, Ant and Dec jetted off the Emerald Isle to retrace their ancestors' footsteps.</p>
      <p>They made their way to a pub in Drumkeeran in County Leitrim, where a local sang for the guests something very familiar to Dec.</p>

      <p>As tears rolled down his cheeks, Dec revealed he "loved" the song and that it had also been performed at his dad's funeral.</p>
      <p>Alphonsus Donnelly died in 2011, aged 78, after a battle with cancer.</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to take to social media to discuss how powerful the show was.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Crying all the way through Ant &amp; Dec's #DNAJourney wishing they were my cousins!"</p>
      <p>"Ant crying, Dec crying I'm crying #AntAndDecsDNAourney," another blubbed.</p>
      <p>A third penned: "The boys crying left me a bit in tears...Especially when Dec told that he knew that song from his dad's funeral. Wow, this is getting not only better but so emotional. #DNAJourney."</p>

      <p>It won't be long before the Geordie duo are back on our telly screens, as they've already touched down in Australia for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/breaking-im-celebrity-2019-line-20835125">next series of I'm A Celebrity</a> .</p>
      <p>The show - which kicks off on 17th November - will be the first time Ant and Dec have reunited in the Aussie jungle after Ant sat out last year's show to focus on his rehabiliation.</p>
      <p>This Morning's Holly Willoughby stood in for him during last year's show, which saw football icon Harry Redknapp crowned the latest King of the Jungle.</p>
