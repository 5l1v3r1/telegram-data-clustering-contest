      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - An Atlanta area school district says a middle school student was diagnosed with measles.</p>
      <p>Cobb County school district officials told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Monday that the infected student attended Mabry Middle School in Marietta.</p>
      <p>The district has alerted parents and says any student who could have caught the illness will not be allowed to return to school until after Nov. 22.</p>
      <p>Measles is highly contagious and can spread through coughs and sneezes.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has experienced a resurgence of the illness that’s fueled by outbreaks in unvaccinated communities.</p>
