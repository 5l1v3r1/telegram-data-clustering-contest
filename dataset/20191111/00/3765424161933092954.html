      <h1>Edgars Stores Zimbabwe in 17 percent sales decline, blames depressed demand</h1>

      <p>Suppressed consumer spending patterns triggered by depressed salaries being paid to potential customers, has led to Edgars Stores Limited’s units experiencing a 17 % sales decline in the year’s first half.</p>
      <p>This was revealed by company’s chairperson, Thembikhosi Sibanda recently.</p>
      <p>As a result of the situation, the clothing chain sold 0.6 million units, down from 0.8 million recorded during the same period last year.</p>
      <p>However, the chain recorded a turnover of $38 million, up from $19 million recorded during a comparative period last year.</p>
      <p>While profit after tax for the period was $14 million, registering a 594 % increase from $1.9 million in the same period last year, such revenue growth was attributed to inflationary pressures and restocking strategies.</p>
      <p>Said Sibanda, “The business benefited from a leaner structure, cost inflation that was trailing top line inflation and pre-emptive stocking arrangements.”</p>
      <p>The Jet Chain sold 0.87 million units as compared to 1.04 million units sold in the first half of 2018, registering a sales decrease of 17 % despite recording an increase in revenue of 91 %.</p>
      <p>Companies within Edgars Stores category have traditionally relied on salaried customers who have been adversely affected by the depressed salary wave affecting the economy.</p>
      <p>According to information gathered by NewZimbabwe.com Business, the security sector employees are earning salaries and allowances around $414, clothing $237, Agriculture around $300 and the commercial sector is paying around $500.</p>
      <p>Civil servants, who normally buy from stores like Edgars, were recently awarded a 76% salary increase that saw the lowest paid worker in government earning about $1 023.</p>
      <p>The amount is still too little to meet basic food and household needs, let alone clothes.</p>
      <p>The trends come at a time the Zimbabwe National Statistics office recently reported that an average Zimbabwean family of five required at least $2 192 in September this year to meet its basic needs for it not to be deemed poor, a 20 percent jump from the previous month.</p>
