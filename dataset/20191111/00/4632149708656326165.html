      <p><b>Devotees flock temples as situation in Ayodhya remains normal; police patrolling continues<br/><br/>AYODHYA </b>The temple town of Ayodhya buzzed with activity on Sunday as devotees flocked various temples to offer prayers amid tight security arrangements, a day after the Supreme Court’s landmark judgment over the century-old Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. <br/><br/>The areas near Hanumangarhi and Naya Ghat were busy from the morning, as people from different walks of life arrived here to pay obeisance to Lord Ram and his ardent devotee Hanuman. <br/><br/>As the sun set, bhajans and kirtans echoed in the temple town. There was no let up in the security arrangements, with police personnel keeping a strict vigil. Intensified patrolling, frisking and searches continued in full swing. <br/><br/>Priest of Ram Lalla, Acharya Satyendra Das said Lord Ram was adorned with a new set of clothes offered by a devotee to mark the day. <br/><br/>People in the Rikabganj area of the city and other parts could be seen going through newspapers to understand the nuances of the verdict. <br/><br/>Sandeep Singh, who works as a manager at a hotel in Ayodhya, said, “This Sunday holds special significance for us, as we woke up to a new and transformed Sunday, with a feeling of relief that the lingering issue of Ayodhya dispute has been resolved once and for all.” “After the judgement in favour of Ram Lalla, we knew that we will fall short of garlands, so we had ordered additional garlands from Varanasi and neighbouring cities,” Anoop Saini said. <br/><br/>Jaipur residents Awadhesh Sharma and Kajormal Sharma said they felt proud and blessed to have been in Ayodhya when the Supreme Court delivered its judgment. <br/><br/>Rampujan and Ramvati were also "feeling happy" as they arrived in Hanumangarhi temple area after 'mundan' of their son Jankaran. <br/><br/>Later, Raju Das, along with local Muslim leader Babloo Khan, took a round of the workshop of the Sriramjanmabhoomi Nyas in Ayodhya. <br/><br/><br/>“I have been following the Quran in letter and spirit. If Kaba is sacred for the Muslims, then the Ramjanmabhoomi is equally sacred for the Hindus. <br/><br/>This is the city of Lord Ram. We welcome the Supreme Court judgment, and each and every citizen should welcome it,” Khan said. <br/><br/><br/>Traffic on the national highway linking Ayodhya to neighbouring cities of Basti, Barabnaki, Azamgarh and Ambedkarnagar and to state capital Lucknow was normal.</p>
