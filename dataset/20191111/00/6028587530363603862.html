      <p>City growth is not inevitable. Since the 1950s, several cities across the Midwest have suffered from population and job losses while overall prosperity has waned compared to their southern and western counterparts. However, past struggles don’t have to continue in the future. In <a href="https://ohiostatepress.org/books/titles/9780814255551.html"><i>Dayton: The Rise, Decline, and Transition of an Industrial City</i></a>, published by the Ohio State University Press, I examine the rise, decline, and transition of Dayton, Ohio and explain why there are reasons to be optimistic about its future and the future of similar cities.Dayton, Ohio is located in the southwest corner of Ohio, about an hour’s drive north of Cincinnati. Like other Midwestern cities, its population grew rapidly in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century as the country’s rural population left their towns and villages for the opportunities of the city. Between 1880 and 1910, Dayton’s population nearly tripled from approximately 39,000 people to over 116,000 as shown in the figure below.</p>

      <p>During this period of growth, the factories of Dayton transitioned from manufacturing iron plows, wooden boxes, pails, and wooden rail cars—products for a more agricultural age—to factories that produced more advanced products such as cash registers and electric generators.</p>
      <p>In addition to its manufacturing prowess, Dayton was also one of the country’s leading centers of innovation. In the first decade of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Dayton generated more patents per person than New York, Boston, Cleveland, Philadelphia, or Detroit. The economic environment that fostered this high level of innovation did so by allowing entrepreneurs to thrive. Creating a culture of innovation is the key to urban success, and in the beginning of the twentieth century Dayton had such a culture.</p>
      <p>Some of the major innovators that thrived in Dayton during this period are household names across Ohio and the country. John H. Patterson was born in Dayton and created the National Cash Register Company (or NCR), the country’s leading manufacturer of cash registers for years. Patterson also pioneered several innovative sales practices including exclusive territories, standardizing best methods, and holding sales conventions.</p>
      <p>Edward Deeds and Charles Kettering, both one-time employees of NCR, founded the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company, or Delco. Kettering was a serial inventor, and one of his creations was the first practical electric starter for cars. His talent eventually attracted the attention of Alfred Sloan, the then president of General Motors (GM), who insisted on acquiring all the companies owned by Deeds and Kettering in order to obtain Kettering’s undivided attention for GM. GM eventually moved Kettering and his research labs from the Dayton area to Detroit to form the backbone of GM’s research and development operations, and Kettering remained in charge of GM’s research arm until his retirement in 1947.</p>
      <p>Patterson, Deeds, and Kettering each made their mark on history, but Dayton’s most famous inventors revolutionized how the world thought about travel, making Ohio the ‘Birthplace of Aviation.’ The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, and their contributions to aviation changed the world. While their first flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina is well-known, it was on Huffman Prairie just outside of Dayton where the brothers mastered the art of flying.</p>
      <p>These are just some of the innovators and business owners who created the products and services that powered Dayton’s economy in the early 1900s. Yet the city wasn’t without problems. In the spring of 1913, a devastating flood covered much of the city’s downtown, causing $1.5 billion in damage and killing 361 people. John Patterson used his own resources to lead the rescue and recovery efforts. In the aftermath of the flood, Patterson also initiated a study for a regional flood-control plan, resulting in the formation of the Miami Conservancy District (MCD). The MCD constructed a flood protection system of five dry basins and dams to protect the region and was paid for by local funds with no financial assistance from the state or federal government. Since the MCD’s creation, the region has been flood-free.</p>
      <p>After the flood Dayton did well until the 1930s. Then, as in other cities throughout the country, the onset of the Great Depression took a toll on the city’s economy. NCR’s workforce declined from 8,500 in 1930 to 3,500 in 1933. By 1935, Dayton’s delinquent taxes totaled $150 million in today’s dollars, which would have made up over 40% of the city’s budget in 2015—a tough situation for any city. Despite the many New Deal programs enacted by the federal government—which often did more harm than good—Dayton’s economy did not recover until the onset of World War II.</p>
      <p>Dayton’s strong manufacturing industry made it a large recipient of government contracts to support the war effort. Dayton stalwarts such as NCR, Delco, Frigidaire, and others secured hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts to produce bomb fuses, rocket motors, machine guns, and bomber landing gear assemblies. By 1943, total city employment was 124% higher than ten years earlier. NCR’s workforce alone reached 20,000 at its peak.</p>
      <p>The city’s population grew during the 1940s as war-time demand attracted southern whites and blacks to Dayton’s factories, as well as those of other northern manufacturing cities. However, the surrounding county’s population grew faster than in Dayton proper. Suburbanization had begun, and over the following decades people would continue to leave Dayton for the nearby suburbs, weakening the city’s position as the area’s economic center in the process.</p>
      <p>Dayton grew for one more decade before its population peaked at just over 262,000 in 1960. Since then it has lost people every decade, and as detailed in <i>Dayton: The Rise, Decline, and Transition of an Industrial City</i>, this decline is due to four main factors: whites—especially those with more education and higher incomes—often moved from the city to the suburbs in response to blacks and poorer whites migrating in from the south; the interstate highway system decreasing the cost of commuting, making it cheaper to live in the suburbs; the relocation of manufacturing employment to lower cost areas of the country coupled with a lack of new jobs, resulting in less demand for workers; and higher crime rates compared to the suburbs deterring families from city living.</p>
      <p>While all these factors contributed to Dayton’s population loss, several have diminished in importance and may no longer be holding Dayton, and similar cities, back. First, people are <a href="https://igpa.uillinois.edu/programs/racial-attitudes">less likely</a> to discriminate based on race than in the past, meaning suburban migration for racial reasons is less prevalent. Second, many portions of the nation’s highway system need repairs or are congested, making it more costly to live in the suburbs and commute to city centers. Third, Dayton and the rest of the country have largely completed the painful transition from a manufacturing economy to a service economy. With the loss of manufacturing jobs complete, cities that relied on them are free to grow anew. Finally, since the 1990s crime has declined in cities compared to the suburbs. So, while the crime rate in Dayton is still higher than in the surrounding suburban communities, the deterrent effect of crime on city living is weaker.</p>
      <p>Still, Dayton will only grow if it does what cities do best: facilitate sharing, matching, and learning. Sharing refers to sharing the specialized inputs needed to produce goods and services. When manufacturing was the dominant industry in cities like Dayton, factories that used inputs from specialty suppliers would often locate near the suppliers to lower shipping costs and make it easier to monitor the quality of suppliers. Delco’s factories made parts for cars and its presence in Dayton made the area attractive for other suppliers and automobile plants. The result was a cluster of automobile-related manufacturing in and around the city, providing jobs for thousands of workers for decades. Today, cities are often the home of specialized services that many firms need, such as lawyers and bankers that handle initial public offerings and other specialized tasks.</p>
      <p>Matching refers to matching workers with employers. Cities are large markets filled with specialized firms not found in smaller towns, and these specialized firms need specialized workers. Having more employers and workers to choose from improves the matching process and this leads to higher productivity for firms and higher wages for workers. The larger labor market also creates a cycle of growth as both business owners and workers who want more choices continue to move to cities.</p>
      <p>Finally, learning refers to the sharing of information—or knowledge spillovers—that occurs when people are close to one another. Sharing information leads to new ideas and the rapid dissemination of best practices, which improve productivity. Firms that aren’t near other firms often fall behind since it’s hard to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change from afar.</p>
      <p>Knowledge spillovers can occur between workers in the same industry, such as the engineers at Ford and GM sharing ideas over drinks in Detroit, or across industries. Sometimes they’re the result of discovering and copying secrets from one another. When Charles Kettering and Edward Deeds were experimenting with eight-cylinder engines in 1914, <a href="https://ohiostatepress.org/books/titles/9780814255551.html">they felt</a> “it was necessary to carry on the experiments in secrecy since Detroit is a rumor factory.”</p>
      <p>Though manufacturing clusters <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.47.4.983">no longer drive</a> city growth, today’s industries that rely on information, such as finance, research and development, scientific services, and technology, still benefit from clustering. The proximity of people and firms in cities means more interactions and these interactions are how information is spread. Successful cities are those that attract entrepreneurs in industries that rely on information and then allow them to experiment and innovate. Burdensome regulations, inefficient government spending, and a climate hostile to change and innovation will repel the people and firms Dayton needs to thrive in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
      <p>As a result, cities need to be flexible and regularly reevaluate their regulations, taxes, and spending priorities. Technological innovation is increasing faster than ever, but local regulations often force entrepreneurs to fit their new products and services into a regulatory system designed for a slower-paced industrial economy rather than our modern faster-paced service and knowledge economy. At the same time, too many cities neglect important infrastructure improvements and mismanage their budgets despite growing revenue, as <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-taking-steps-to-avoid-projected-future-budget-13509714.php">in San Francisco</a> or <a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2019/02/07/bill-de-blasio-calls-for-budget-cuts-for-2020-fiscal-year-nyc-painting-grim-economic-future">New York</a>.</p>
      <p>Cities like Dayton that want to improve their economy can adopt a policy of <a href="https://techliberation.com/2017/05/18/does-permissionless-innovation-even-mean-anything/">permissionless innovation</a>. According to technology researcher Adam Thierer, “[p]ermissionless innovation refers to the notion that experimentation with new technologies and business models should generally be permitted by default.” Some regulatory action may be necessary, but incremental regulation that addresses specific, tangible, and immediate problems is less likely to stifle the development of new and better products and services than sweeping bans enacted due to fears of hypothetical, worst-case scenarios.</p>
      <p>As I discuss in my book, there is evidence that urban areas with an accepting attitude about risk are more innovative. The implication is that cities can gain a competitive edge by attracting risk-loving individuals who increase the probability of innovation occurring in the city. A citywide policy of permissionless innovation is a conspicuous sign of a city’s positive attitude toward risk-taking and can help attract the entrepre­neurs cities need to be successful.</p>
      <p>Several other recommendations are discussed in-depth in my book, but the key takeaway for officials in Dayton and similar Midwestern cities is that people are leaving colder areas of the country <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2018/06/01/southern-and-western-cities-continue-their-rapid-growth/#14b20b843d67">for warmer ones</a>, and will likely continue to do so, meaning Dayton’s climate and geography are disadvantages. Thus, Dayton will have to compensate for relatively poor weather by creating a more attractive business environment. Ultimately, cities that implement or maintain policies that make it easier for entrepreneurs to generate new activities to replace the old will have more resilient economies and a greater chance of long-term prosperity.</p>
      <p>Dayton’s downtown is already much livelier than a mere ten years ago, a phenomenon <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2018/02/16/city-living-is-back-and-immigrants-can-help-struggling-cities-get-in-on-the-action/#10579c2d4af6">widespread</a> across America. Younger, educated workers who are staying single longer than those of previous generations want to live in places with a variety of bars, restaurants, and shops where they can mingle with other singles and live a walkable lifestyle. Cities that allow developers to capitalize on these trends will create more attractive city centers that can form the backbone of their region’s economy.</p>
      <p>While city officials have a role to play in Dayton’s revival, it’s important for them to remember that they are not the ultimate cause. City policies can encourage or hinder development but as economist Ed Glaeser said, “Private entrepreneurs, not public officials, power urban economies.” Dayton’s success is contingent on its ability to attract those entrepreneurs.</p>
