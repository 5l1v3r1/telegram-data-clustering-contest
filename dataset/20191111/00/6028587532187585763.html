      <p>Last week, Selena Gomez <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/04/selena-gomez-hits-no-1-for-the-first-time-with-new-single-lose-you-to-love-me/">scored her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100</a> with her near-instant smash “Lose You to Love Me,” but it was destined to be a one-frame leader. This time around, Scottish singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi finds its way back to the throne on the most important songs ranking in the U.S. for a second nonconsecutive turn with his first big hit in America, “Someone You Loved.”Up to a new high point on the Hot 100 is Post Malone’s “Circles,” which has proven to be a sturdy giant from his most recent full-length <i>Hollywood’s Bleeding</i>, which <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/11/11/post-malone-returns-to-no-1-on-the-us-albums-chart-while-miranda-lambert-scores-the-only-top-10-debut/">returns to the peak position</a> on the Billboard 200 this week. The track looks like it may reach the summit in the coming frames, if “Someone You Loved” will step aside once more.</p>
      <p>Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello see their most recent collaboration “Senorita” rise to No. 3 once again, while Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” also lifts slightly, landing at No. 4. </p>
      <p>After vaulting from outside the top 10 to No. 1 in one fell swoop, Selena Gomez tumbles to fifth place with “Lose You to Love Me,” which is assumed to be the first taste of her highly-anticipated upcoming album. It’s not common to see a song fall so far from the top spot, but as it continues to gain in radio play, the track may advance again.</p>
      <p>Lizzo owns two spots inside the uppermost region once again, as her most recent focus “Good as Hell” holds at No. 6 this frame. Chris Brown and Drake come next with “No Guidance” at No. 7, and that successful cut is followed by Lil Nas X’s “Panini” at No. 8. Two rungs down, Dan + Shay and Justin Bieber find themselves inside the top 10 once again with “10,000 Hours,” which has bounced in and out of the region several times since it first debuted at No. 4.</p>
      <p>The sole new entrant inside the loftiest tier on the Hot 100 comes from beloved pop band Maroon 5. The group’s recent single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlPhMPnQ58k">“Memories,”</a> which has been stuck at No. 11 for a pair of frames, climbs to No. 9, entering the top 10 for the first time. The outfit has now collected 15 top 10 hits throughout their time together.</p>
