      <p>Duchess of York <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sarah-ferguson">Sarah Ferguson</a> made her fans' day when she posted an iconic video of herself avoiding the hustle and bustle of Beijing airport on a scooter suitcase.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old royal figure made a joke on how to avoid getting in the way of others by opting for a suitcase with wheels - and a motor.</p>
      <p>The former wife of Prince Andrew posted the funny video on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> wearing a smart green blazer and a long black skirt, carrying a large bag on her wrist.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "When in Beijing Airport.... 'If you can keep your head when all about you, are losing theirs and blaming it on you'.....go and get a scooter suitcase! #china."</p>
      <p>Fans were loving her video, and labelled her a "legend" for the time-saving idea.</p>

      <p>One fan wrote: "You are the best, I needed a smile today," with a heart emoji.</p>
      <p>Another gushed, "How brilliant xxx I would need a larger one than that though," with a laughing face.</p>
      <p>And a third penned: "Lol! Not very royal, but that's why we love you!"</p>

      <p>Sarah has recently faced backlash after photos of the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton were used to promote a cosmetic clinic frequented the Duchess of York in the latest royal gaffe.</p>
      <p>Fergie has had a series of procedures at the Harley Street site and last week made a video tribute about its services.</p>
      <p>But there was outrage as the Dr Gabriela clinic used old snaps of Kate, 37, in promotional posts on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>Royal sources suggested Buckingham Palace would be dismayed that the images of Kate had been misused.</p>
      <p>In the first, taken at Wimbledon in 2014, she wears very little make-up and in the second, taken two years earlier at an evening do, she has a glamorous evening look.</p>
      <p>In broken English alongside the photos were the words: “Imagination of natural look. We are doing procedures that you look like fresh you.”</p>

      <p>Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said: "What is so blatantly awful in using these images is that prospective clients may be inclined to think that Kate has had a laser facelift or other treatment from this company when she most certainly has not.</p>
      <p>"This appears to be a very ill-thought-out campaign by one of the many, many skin doctors that set themselves up in Harley Street. This is another episode in the daily life of the Yorks, I'm afraid."</p>
