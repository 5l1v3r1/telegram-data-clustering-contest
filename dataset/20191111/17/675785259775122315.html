      <p>A pet Chihuahua was grabbed by a bird of prey as it walked around a family garden, its owners said.</p>
      <p>Sheila Gillanders, 72, said her 18-month-old white Chihuahua was plucked from the ground by a "really big bird" after it swooped from the sky.</p>
      <p>Emma's horrified owners, from Aberdeen, Scotland, luckily spotted the bird trying to fly off with their beloved pet and dashed to help.</p>
      <p>Sheila said Emma was thankfully saved when her husband Robert grabbed the small dog's body and managed to pluck it from the bird's claws.</p>
      <p>Sheila said Emma's stress is now "sky-high" and she is terrified of returning to the garden, reports the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-50376499">BBC</a> .</p>
      <p>She added: "It pinned her against the fence. It only got so far up, but my husband was able to get the bird off her.</p>

      <p>"It then just looked at us. It was a really big bird, like a buzzard. It was definitely trained, as it was wearing a bell."</p>
      <p>Emma suffered injuries during her "very lucky" escape and needed veterinary treatment and medication.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a heartbroken family revealed their Chihuahua Gizmo had been grabbed by a seagull .</p>
      <p>They were not so lucky, and claimed the gull flew off with four-year-old Gizmo who was playing in the back garden of Becca Hill's house in Paignton, Devon.</p>
      <p>The brown and white dog, whose breed only grows to around nine inches high,has not been seen since.</p>
      <p>Becca, 24, issued a social media appeal for news of Gizmo, one of three chihuahuas she owns.</p>

      <p>"It carried Gizmo a fair way as we couldn't see him anymore.</p>
