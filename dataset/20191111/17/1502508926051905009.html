      <p>The share of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/direct-plans">direct plans </a>as a percentage of overall equity and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/debt-assets">debt assets </a>stood at 15.2 per cent and 62.3 per cent as on September 30, 2019. The share is up 9 percentage points and 15.6 percentage points, respectively, over a five-year period, but has not budged much in the past two years. The bulk of the money in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/debt-assets">debt assets </a>is from institutional investors.</p>
      <p>The percentage of direct investments in equity schemes may inch up further, with wealthy investors increasingly routing their money through registered investment advisers and wealth management firms.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/direct-plans">Direct plans </a>allow investors to bypass distributors and save on commission. These have a higher net asset value than regular plans, the expense ratio is also less. Investors can save 80-100 basis points in direct equity plans vis-a-vis the regular equity ones.</p>
      <p>The Securities and Exchange Board of India has, time and again, expressed concerns over the muted response to these plans. In August, the regulator said the difference between regular and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/direct-plans">direct plans </a>was not equivalent to the distribution commission in some schemes.</p>
