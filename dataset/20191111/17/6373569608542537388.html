      <p>Young children from across Plymouth have come together to mark Armistice Day.</p>
      <p>The Royal Naval Preschool Learning Organisation that runs seven childcare nurseries - known as Jack and Jill’s Childcare in Plymouth and Torpoint - today were able to join Goosewell Primary Academy’s children in paying their respects and remembering those serving who have died during both world wars and other conflicts around the world.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the nursery said: "Children from Jack and Jill’s Plymstock attended the service at the war memorial at Burrow Hill, Plymstock, along with representatives from various military organisations and councillors to hold a two-minute silence and lay wreaths and poppy crosses.</p>
      <p>"The Jack and Jill’s children attending were aged between three and four years old and were accompanied by members of the preschool staff and Trustees.</p>
