      <p>Gareth Bale is back on the grass. However not as a Real Madrid player, but for his country, Wales. Bale had no problem training with his international team-mates after missing four weeks of Madrid sessions with injury.</p>
      <p>Bale was injured during the last Wales game and since then he has not played.</p>
      <p>Now he's back with his national team to face Azerbaijan and Hungary in the Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs counts on him for the games and everything indicates Bale will play for the first time since he suffered pain against Croatia on October 13.</p>
      <p>In Spain, Bale's attitude has been heavily criticised.</p>
