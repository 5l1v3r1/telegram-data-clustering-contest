      <h1>Nawaz Sharif can receive medical treatment anywhere he wants: Yasmin Rashid</h1>

      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Punjab Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid has on Monday said that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s disease has been diagnosed and he can receive medical treatment anywhere he wants.</p>
      <p>The health minister, while addressing a press conference in Lahore, said the blood sugar levels of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supreme leader are not under control and he is being given steroids among other medicines.</p>
      <p>“Nawaz Sharif has been granted bail on medical grounds on doctors’ report. An application has been forwarded to the interior ministry for the PML-N supremo’s treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>“Nawaz Sharif’s platelets count was too low when he was admitted to the Services Hospital. Among other experts, Karachi’s Dr Tahir Shamsi was also taken on board for the erstwhile premier’s treatment.</p>
      <p>“Nawaz Sharif was discharged from the hospital on November 6 and the interior ministry summoned his medical report along with suggestion for treatment abroad from the provincial government.</p>
      <p>“The PML-N supremo has a long medical history as his sugar levels also affect kidneys and muscles. His condition was critical when he was admitted to the hospital and the medical board worked without any political influence.”</p>
      <p>Dr Yasmin Rashid further added that the medical board will deliberate on Nawaz Sharif’s health today as well in a meeting. </p>
