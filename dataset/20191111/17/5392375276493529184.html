      <p>Samsung will sell Galaxy M phone at offline retailers in India by 2020<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Samsung Galaxy M-series is alongside the Galaxy A-series the South-Korean way of reinventing its midrange smartphone division. Back in 2018, the company has seen massive losses due to the lack of interest in their midranges. With the Galaxy M and A-series, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> is bringing some features that were only present in their past flagships. The Galaxy M-series is available in some emerging markets, but it’s mainly focused in the Indian stronghold.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy M devices are available on Flipkart, Amazon and on Samsung’s own website, as well as the Samsung Experience Stores across the country. However, there’s one big field missing – the third party offline market. Indian customers, third-party retailers, it’s time to rejoice! According to a report, Samsung will fill this gap by 2020.</p>

      <p>The report comes from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/samsung-to-take-galaxy-m-smartphones-offline/articleshow/72000427.cms"><i>The Economic Times</i></a> that states that some retailers are demanding manufacturers like Xiaomi, vivo, Oppo, and Samsung, to start working with them again. This is a response to the 30-40% decline in offline sales. All India Traders and All India Mobile Retailers Association showed their concern with the predatory pricing online retailers are setting. It’s nearly impossible for third-party retailers to compete with online sales, especially during big sale events during holidays.</p>
      <p>Samsung will strive to increase its expressiveness across third-party retailers in the next year. However, only the time will tell if this will boost total sales.</p>
