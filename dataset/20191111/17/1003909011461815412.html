      <p>Calgary Opera’s production of Puccini’s imperishable La Boheme opened its 48th season last week for a three performance run at the Jubilee Auditorium. It is easy to dismiss La Boheme as an over-performed opera, but if one were to count hands, I wonder how many people in the audience were seeing their first production of this evergreen work? I had the sense that for all the old-timers in the audience there were equally as many for whom this was their time seeing the opera. And it seems that of the members of the CPO, roughly half were playing their first performance. What is old is new again.</p>
      <p>Without question the performance was a hit with the audience: the singers were all enthusiastically applauded, and the production itself was warmly received.  With work as generally familiar as this, it is natural to wonder what new or special element was brought to this particular production. This was the question posed to conductor Jonathan Brandani and stage director Brenna Corner in a local TV interview. Their response, born out in the production and performance, was to trust the composer and to endeavour to perform the opera as conceived by Puccini, if with a due sense of contemporary taste. No attempt was made to make some larger social or political comment.</p>
      <p>Essentially the opera was played as written, with the sets (from Montreal Opera) conceived to evoke a garret in 1830s Paris, the Cafe Momus, and a scene by a tavern. This evoking of a sense of period was imaginatively reinforced through images of 1830s Paris projected on-screen with the old walls easily visible and with stylized views of the Latin Quarter.</p>
      <p>A sense of period atmosphere is crucial to the ambience of this opera, and there was plenty of that to savour in the set, the action on stage, and the overall feeling of the production. From a dramatic point of view, modern audiences, raised on TV, don’t like too many blank spaces in the dramatic action. And there were definitely no blank spaces in this production. The production was filled with stage action of all kinds, especially in the well-timed comedy that opens the final act and in the dramatically complex scene at the Cafe Momus. The Cafe Momus scene is a touchstone of “realism” in opera history, and as carefully as Puccini has written it, it also takes a tremendous amount of work to realize on stage the picturing of the bustling Latin Quarter at Christmas Eve.</p>
      <p>Brenna Corner, returning for her first stint as main stage director, imbued the cafe scene, and production generally, with inner life and vivacity. There were many fine touches of detail: the actions of the waiters, the antics of Alcindoro, and the role of the children, sung by the Cantare Children’s choir, who somehow managed to keep up with the super-rapid tempo of the music. It was all champagne and fizz dramatically, and the Momus act drew a very strong audience response. This was yet another fine vocal/dramatic outing for Calgary Opera’s fine chorus.</p>
      <p>La Boheme is an opera about young people, and there is a tradition of giving operatic newcomers a chance to try their wings. New to Calgarians and making her Calgary Opera debut was Canadian-Syrian soprano Miriam Khalil as Mimi. Khalil has in the past few years moved from “promising” to a now established opera career. She was vocally the most compelling of the cast. With a voice high and strong enough to bring full emotion to the big passages, Khalil also possesses a strong middle register and a memorable beauty of tone colour. This was a portrayal of Mimi that she can, so to speak, take to the bank: many companies will be happy to have a Mimi as natural on stage as this, and who can bring a tear to the eye in moments of passion or pathos.</p>
      <p>Quebec tenor Antoine Belanger was the production’s Rudolfo. With a nicely developing career, he has the natural voice to sing lyric roles in the French and Italian romantic repertoire. Naturally a rather high voice, he had no difficulty with the high-lying role, his first act aria (Che gelida manina) free and eloquent, and building to an appropriately fine climax.  Easy on stage, he interacted well with his bohemian buddies and was all romantic effusion with Mimi. The final scene, sometimes a bit awkward in the staging, was here quite natural and unforced. Perhaps his best singing came is his fourth act aria, an aria that in its light scoring and sentimental character permitted the best of his singing to emerge.</p>
      <p>One could only admire the big, beefy baritone of Peter Barrett. The beef element was particularly welcome in the second act where Marcello has to sing Musetta’s song over an entire orchestra plus full chorus. But Barrett could be clearly heard, and without forcing, his voice rising to it top register without strain, yet remaining fully in the best baritonal fashion. Also easy on stage, this was a fine projection of the role of Marcello, one of the opera’s most human and sympathetic characters.</p>
      <p>Marcello’s love interest was Joanna Latini, the production’s Musetta. With a voice as strong as Mimi’s, but perhaps with a more innate dramatic quality, she delivered all the was needed in the famous Waltz Song in the Cafe Momus act, her infuriating actions (at least to Marcello) filled with comedy and impressive wilfulness—Musetta’s underlying quality.  Latini made a strong impression and earned her full share of applause at the end.</p>
      <p>The other singers were fully commendable, if on a vocally lower level than the four principals. Peter McGillivray as Schaunard, the musician among the bohemians, sang acceptably well, if with a less striking voice than the others. On stage, however, he was very much the catalyst of the action and the principal source of much of the comedy. Evidently experienced on stage, he was well cast in the role. He was well-matched with the more aloof Colline, sung by Neil Craighead. Colline gets the famous, if short, coat aria in the final act, sung on this occasion with feeling and emotion—not a major role, but with its own quiet inner statement. I especially enjoyed the comedy work of Stefan Szkafarowsky in the twin roles of Alcindoro and Benoit, the maximum comedy from each role extracted but without overstatement.</p>
      <p>Among the several debuts with the company in this production was conductor Jonathan Brandini, who led the CPO in a strongly characterized account of the rich orchestral accompaniment. In general, he preferred somewhat quick tempos, perhaps more so than my own personal taste. Played too quickly, Puccini’s music can lose some of its inner emotion. It is, of course, important to avoid sentimentality in this opera, but I would have preferred just a touch more. It was evident from the outset that Brandini knows the score well and has clear ideas about what he would like from the orchestra and the singers. Obviously competent and strong as a leader, he revealed a distinctive personality and affinity for this music. I hope he will return soon.</p>
      <p>In all, this is a traditional performance of a traditional opera—but this should not be taken as criticism.  More than other opera composers in the great tradition, Puccini was extremely precise about what he wanted on stage and in the music. Trusting in the genius of the composer, the stage direction and musical direction of this La Boheme provide the audience with an emotionally compelling, visually distinctive evening filled with comedy, delicate sentiment, and vocal thrills—all good reasons to attend this opera</p>
