      <h1>EastEnders' spoilers: Mel's humiliating plan to expose Sharon in front of whole Square</h1>
      <h2>Unhinged Mel Owen, played by Tamzin Outhwaite, continues to spiral out of control as she plans a nasty surprise for Louise and the rest of her family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:33:29+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:33</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Hill, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rose-hill/</a></address>
      <p>Mel Owen's twisted attempt at revenge begins to spiral out of control as she looks set to humiliate Sharon Mitchell in front of her friends and family on EastEnders tonight.</p>
      <p>The grieving mum, played by Tamzin Outhwaite, has been using Sharon's affair with Keanu (and that she is pregnant with his baby) as her ace in a bid to get what she wants.</p>
      <p>Yet a new villa in Spain and forcing Sharon to sell her half of E20 isn't enough for Mel as she begins to plan a party for Sharon and Louise.</p>
      <p>Insisting that friends and family of the pair keep it all a secret, she elaborately decorates the club with photos.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Sharon gets wind of what Mel is planning and implores Keanu to get Louise out of Walford, uncertain of what Mel's objective is.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, Louise has already found out about the bash and is busy getting ready for it.</p>
      <p>Sharon tentatively arrives for the party with Louise and Mel's plan begins to unfold...</p>
      <p>What is she up to?</p>
      <p>In an explosive trailer for this month, Sharon and Keanu are seen panicking as they make their way across the Square.</p>

      <p>Keanu demands to know what they're going to do, but soon the party is underway and Mel appears unhinged.</p>
      <p>In scenes later, the guests look horrified over an announcement made at the bash - including Louise and Lisa, who cover their mouths in shock.</p>
      <p>Will Mel tell all of their friends and family about who the real dad of Sharon's baby is?</p>
