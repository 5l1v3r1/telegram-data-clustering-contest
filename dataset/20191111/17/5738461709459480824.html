      <p>An Ardee woman has told the Dundalk Democrat she is "livid" after her car hit a 5-inch deep pothole in an estate in Ardee and busted her tyre. </p>
      <p>Ciara Courtney told how she has been quoted €165 for a new tyre which will take one week to be ordered in. </p>
      <p>The Louth lady has called on local councillors to fix the health and safety issue as soon as possible. </p>
      <p>Ms Courtney said: "I went to visit my friend on Saturday night in Rockfield Close Estate in Ardee. Just before I arrived to her house, I drove into a pothole and busted my tyre. I don’t have the car a month! Straight away I lost pressure from the tyre and as it was so dark, it was hard to see how badly the tyre was damaged.   </p>
      <p>"Next morning the tyre was indeed busted. Myself and my father went to see the pothole for ourselves and measured the depth of the pothole. </p>
      <p>"Surely this has to be a health and safety issue? People cycling around estates and children playing. Someone will get very hurt.</p>
      <p>"I am in the middle of trying to find out who covers this cost now? I have been quoted €165 for a new tyre and it takes a week to get it.</p>
      <p>"I tweeted Louth County Council at the weekend and two local councillors. One councillor did reply but I am still going to be out of pocket because of the state of that road."  </p>
