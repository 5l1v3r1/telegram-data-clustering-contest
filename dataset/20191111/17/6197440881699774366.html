      <h3>Score a Google Home Mini + Chromecast for $45</h3>
      <p>Walmart offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/11/google-home-mini-chromecast-deals/">Google Home Mini and Chromecast bundle for <b>$45 shipped</b></a>. You’d typically pay $70 for this bundle, which is in-line with our previous mentions. We are expecting to see slightly better pricing for Black Friday. Google Home Mini features always-on access to Assistant and allows you to control your smart home, adjust music playback and more. Chromecast enters the mix to bring your favorite content to any TV.</p>
      <h3>Skagen’s sleek Falster 2 Smartwatch runs Google Wear OS</h3>

That’s 50% off the typical rate found at retailers like Target and beats the lowest Amazon offer we have tracked by $30. Whether you are iPhone or Android user, this Google Wear OS smartwatch will pair nicely either way. This platform-agnostic approach allows you to keep an open mind and explore all of the latest tech without being held down by proprietary devices. This model sports a small 40mm case, ensuring a great fit for a wide variety of wrist sizes. It works with all Skagen 20mm bands, making it fairly simple to switch your style.
