      <p>Brazilian playmaker Philippe Coutinho is the loan player with the most value in the five big leagues, per the CIES Football Observatory.</p>
      <p>Their study reports that he is worth 96.5 million euros - a figure under the 120m euro option to buy that Bayern Munich have on the midfielder.</p>
      <p>He is not having a great time in Germany where he is no longer essential after a promising start tot he season.</p>
      <p>Coutinho is playing where he likes, in attacking midfield, when he does feature.</p>
      <p>He is followed by Arsenal's Dani Ceballos (65.7m euros) and Martin Odegaard of Real Sociedad (57.3m), both on loan from Real Madrid.</p>
