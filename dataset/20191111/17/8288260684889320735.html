      <h1>30 Under 30 finalists team up to host mental health workshop</h1>
      <h2>Amy Francis-Smith and Katie Buckingham met through BirminghamLive's 30 Under 30 campaign earlier this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:09:38+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author">Tamlyn Jones, https://www.facebook.com/tamlynjonesbpm/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>A workshop has been held to address mental health issues in the city's property sector which came about as a result of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/30-under-30">BirminghamLive's 30 Under 30 campaign.</a></p>
      <p>The 'Architects' Wellbeing Workshop' examined issues such as awareness in the workplace and the Architects Benevolent Society's #AnxietyArch campaign.</p>
      <p>Amy Francis-Smith, who is a committee member of the Birmingham Architectural Association, teamed up with Katie Buckingham, founder of Altruist Enterprises which advises employees on tackling mental health in the workplace.</p>
      <p>The pair met earlier this year through BirminghamLive's 30 Under 30 initiative which highlighted 30 of the most inspiring and enterprising young people currently working and making a difference in the city.</p>
      <p>Around 50 people from the built environment sector attended the workshop which also included practical tips about dealing with mental health at work and heard from Fraser Godfrey from city practice Glenn Howells Architects.</p>
      <p>Amy was a 30 Under 30 finalist <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/how-30-under-30-finalist-16128405">because of her work on inclusive property design,</a> in particular providing decent accommodation for the disabled.</p>
      <p>She campaigns on the issue through talks, national events, design projects and volunteering.</p>
      <p>Katie was just 19 when she <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/entrepreneur-katie-buckingham-blazing-trail-16200359">founded her company Altruist Enterprises</a> in Birmingham which provides resilience, stress management and mental health awareness training to organisations and schools nationally.</p>
      <p>The company was borne out of her own experiences with mental ill health and her frustration at a lack of awareness of the subject.</p>
      <p>Her aim is to see mental health being treated in the same way as physical health in workplaces and schools.</p>
