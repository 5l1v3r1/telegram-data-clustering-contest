      <p>The most recent episode of <i>Last Week Tonight</i> is John Oliver's celebratory victory lap over the end of coal giant Bob Murray's lawsuit against the show. Murray was suing for a 2017 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aw6RsUhw1Q8">episode</a> calling Murray a "geriatric Dr. Evil" and for running a scene of a man in a squirrel costume holding a large bank check that said "Eat Shit Bob."</p>
      <p>Oliver said the lawsuit was a "bullshit effort to silence us" -- in other words, a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation), which is a way for rich creeps to abuse the legal system to silence anyone who says anything negative about them. (In 2010 <a href="https://boingboing.net/2010/02/23/magicjack-dials-wron.html">Boing Boing was hit with a SLAPP</a> and the plaintiff ended up having to pay us more than $50,000 in legal costs.)</p>
