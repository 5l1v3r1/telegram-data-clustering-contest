      <p>If you’re getting a jump start on plans for Valentine’s Day next year, look no further, because horror production company <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/17/17984162/halloween-blumhouse-female-director">Blumhouse</a> have you covered.</p>
      <p>The first iteration of <i>Fantasy Island</i> debuted in 1977, with Ricardo Montalbán starring as a mysterious man named “Mr. Roarke,” who would enact the fantasies of the guests upon his island — for a price. Each episode of the show would focus on a different wish, with their results usually meant to teach a life lesson.</p>

      <p>The reboot, directed by Jeff Wadlow, is a little more vicious. Michael Peña takes on the role of Roarke, with Lucy Hale, Maggie Q, Ryan Hansen, and Jimmy O. Yang as his guests. (Roarke’s assistant Tattoo, played by Hervé Villechaize, will not feature in the new film.)</p>
      <p>At first, the island seems like a paradise, but it soon becomes apparent that the wishes they’ve made are being twisted around back upon them, and that their lives are on the line. The trailer sees each guest realizing that all is not as it seems, with even the employees of the resort suffering bloody consequences.</p>
      <p>The movie is set to his theaters on theaters Feb. 14, 2020.</p>
