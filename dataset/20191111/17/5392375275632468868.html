      <p>For Apple fans, the most powerful processor in the world is the A-line chips. This is also true for Samsung and Huawei fans that think the best chips are the Exynos series and Kirin series SoCs. And we are not talking about the whole Android camp smartphones that are mainly using Qualcomm Snapdragon chips. But all these statements are true only for mid-to-high-end smartphones. But there are other niches/categories as well. Say, the most selling smartphones belong to the low-end and regular mid-range groups. And in these niches, the Taiwanese MediaTek has no equals. Today, the company announced the October revenue report and <a href="https://m.ithome.com/html/456170.htm">it turns out</a> things are going well.</p>
