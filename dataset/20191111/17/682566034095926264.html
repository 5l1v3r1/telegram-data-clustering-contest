      <p>Sarajevo - <b>Bosnian </b>police arrested 12 people on Monday, mostly referees, suspected of match-fixing in the Balkan country's second division, a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The investigation is targeting officials and regional football association executives, the prosecutors added in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Within this operation we arrested twelve people, suspected of organised crime and abuse of power," a police spokesman told AFP.</p>
      <p>Homes of several suspects were searched in the north-eastern towns of Samac and Orasje, and in Novi Travnik, in central Bosnia, spokesman Luka Miladinovic added.</p>
      <p>They are "suspected of demanding and receiving, during 2019, gifts and other forms of benefits, to fix the results of certain matches" played in Bosnia's Muslim-Croat half, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The suspects were predominantly receiving cash but the amounts were not revealed.</p>
      <p>Bosnia has one national league while the two cultural entities that have made up the country since the 1990s war - the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbs' Republika Srpska - each have their own league.</p>
      <p>The dozen suspects will be handed over to prosecutors who will decide on whether they will be remanded in custody, Miladinovic said.</p>
      <p>Bosnia's Football Federation hailed the operation and voiced regret over "huge damages" the affair caused to the country's football reputation.</p>
