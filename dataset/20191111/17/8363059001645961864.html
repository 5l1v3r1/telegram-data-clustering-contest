      <h1>Sky Q is Adding BBC iPlayer to its Lineup</h1>

      <p>Sky is great if you have a subscription and can find something you want to watch in its catalogues, but it's never been so good for working in other streaming services. <a href="https://www.sky.com/help/diagnostics/sky-tv-apps-on-sky-q/which-app-would-you-like-help-with">Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify</a> are available through Sky Q but that's about it. Well times are changing, because iPlayer is also on the way.</p>
      <p>BBC shows have been available to watch on Sky's own catch-up services before, but those tend to be quite slow to appear. Slower than iPlayer used to be, which many people will remember was rather slow. In the days of being able to watch stuff right away, and even restarting shows that are being broadcast live, that's not good enough.</p>
      <p>So this partnership makes a lot of sense, and it's perfect for people who wouldn't want to use the iPlayer app on a separate streaming device, or through their crappy smart TV interface.</p>
      <p>To find iPlayer in Sky Q you'll need to head to the 'Catch Up' menu, and pick BBC. You'll find iPlayer right at the bottom of the BBC sub-menu. The app itself is basically the same as you'd find anywhere else, just with the added convenience of being on your Sky box.</p>
      <p>But that's not all. The deal will also see the BBC's kids programming available on Sky Kids safe mode, while BBC Sounds will also come to Sky Q in the near future. [<a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/tv/news/sky/150041-full-bbc-iplayer-finally-comes-to-sky-q">Pocket Lint</a>]</p>
