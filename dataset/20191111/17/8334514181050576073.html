      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - Three bombs exploded in Qamishli in northeast Syria on Monday, killing five people and wounding 26 in the city, which is largely-controlled by Kurdish fighters, security forces said.</p>
      <p>Two cars and a rigged motorcycle exploded near a cafe and a church, a statement from the region’s security forces said. The wounded included four security force members, it said, describing the blasts as a “terrorist operation”.</p>
      <p>With the Kurdish YPG militia at its forefront, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) defeated Islamic State across much of north and east Syria with U.S. help.</p>
      <p>A series of bomb attacks have struck towns and villages in northern Syria in the past year, including in the SDF region.</p>
      <p>Kurdish leaders say Islamic State sleeper cells still pose a threat and warn that a Turkish offensive at the border would allow a jihadist resurgence.</p>
      <p>Ankara launched its incursion last month into northeast Syria to target the YPG, after President Donald Trump’s decision to move U.S. troops out of the way. Turkey deems the YPG a threat linked to a decades-long Kurdish insurgency at home.</p>
