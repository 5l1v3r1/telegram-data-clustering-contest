      <h1>Google is testing useful pop-up clipboard suggestions on Pixel 4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:49:03+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Software is the best part of every Pixel smartphone and it seems Google has a nice addition hidden on the Pixel 4. Apparently, Google is testing pop-up clipboard suggestions on Pixel 4 devices.</p>
      <p>We’ve noticed since getting the <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/31/google-pixel-4-review/">Pixel 4</a> that the device will often suggest pasting the contents of your clipboard in text fields of various apps. For example, copying a link from Chrome and then opening a message in Discord will see the device quickly suggest pasting the link in that chat.</p>
      <p>However, this feature seems to be a bit unstable at the moment. The pop-up box only appears until you’ve tapped elsewhere on the field and only appears to work if it is used directly after copying the content.</p>
      <p>When I first spotted this feature, I assumed it was a part of Gboard or Android itself, but it seems that may not be the case. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/09/android-10-adds-handy-clipboard-pasting-pop-up-suggestions-starting-with-the-pixel-4/"><i>Android Police</i></a> cites several readers who have the feature and they’re all on Pixel 4 and only seeing it on that device. It even works with other keyboard options.</p>
      <p>While it definitely seems possible this feature could eventually make its way to more Android 10 devices, it seems that it is Pixel 4 exclusive at the moment. Whatever the case, it’s a handy feature we hope Google will continue to develop over time.</p>
