      <p>Warnock said: “Today I am leaving my beloved Bluebirds after over three years of which have been some of the best days in my long football career.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank Vincent Tan and Ken Choo for their support; Victoria my secretary who has had to look after me over the years; Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson, my ever-faithful sidekicks and friends; and all the backroom staff on both the coaching and the medical sides who have worked tirelessly to help us achieve the success we have had.</p>
      <p>“A special mention also to all of my players, past and present, who have given me everything. Thank you, you’re a great bunch.”</p>
