      <h1>Meet adorable therapy pig LiLou who's helping out stressed airport passengers</h1>
      <h2>LiLou the therapy pig is on hand to help stressed airport passengers whether she's posing for selfies or playing a tune on her piano</h2>

      <p>Pigs might not fly, but LiLou the therapy pig wants to make air travel less stressful.</p>
      <p>The five-year-old Juliana pig and her owner, Tatyana Danilova, are part of San Francisco International Airport's "Wag Brigade" - a program that brings therapy animals to the airport to cheer passengers up and help ease travel anxieties.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a pilot's cap and with toenails painted bright red, LiLou breezes through the metal detector at airport security and trots to the departure gates.</p>
      <p>She raises a hoof in greeting, poses for selfies and entertains departing passengers with a tune on her toy piano.</p>
      <p>Danilova said: "People are very happy to get distracted from the travel, from their routines, whether they're flying on their journey for vacation or work.</p>
      <p>"Everybody is usually very happy and it makes them pause for a second and smile and be like, 'oh, it's great'."</p>

      <p>When she's not delighting passengers at the airport, LiLou lives with Danilova in her downtown San Francisco apartment, where she enjoys a diet of organic vegetables and protein pellets, sleeps in her own bed and goes for daily walks around the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Danilova says LiLou loves interacting with people, but, as a prey animal, doesn't like having anyone approach her from behind.</p>
      <p>At the airport, eight-year-old Katie Schroeder, from San Ramon, California, squealed in delight as LiLou bashed out a tune on her piano, using her hooves and snout.</p>

      <p>She said: "I've never seen a pig in the airport. She can do tricks like a dog."</p>
      <p>Guest services manager Jennifer Kazarian says LiLou is the world's first airport therapy pig in a "Wag Brigade" program, which includes dogs of all breeds and sizes, that she has built a sense of community in the airport.</p>
      <p>She explained: "When we first launched the program, our main goal was to relieve stress for our passengers. However, what we have found is we have formed a connection with our passengers and it's been totally amazing."</p>

      <p>All the therapy animals take part in a training program with the San Francisco SPCA and must have a stable temperament, good manners and a friendly personality, she said.</p>
      <p>As for little 'accidents', Kazarian said there have not been any issues. All the animals, including LiLou, are house-trained.</p>
