      <p>California has the most unsheltered homeless people in the United States, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.<br/><br/>The Golden State has an estimated 130,000 homeless people, and more than half of them - about 69% - are in unsheltered locations. That means they live on the street, in abandoned buildings and other unsheltered places.<br/><br/><a href="https://files.hudexchange.info/resources/documents/2018-AHAR-Part-1.pdf">The annual estimate report that was delivered to Congress</a> shows that about two-thirds of people nationwide who are homeless live in emergency shelters and different government housing programs.<br/><br/><i>Watch Eyewitness This for more stories making headlines.</i></p>
