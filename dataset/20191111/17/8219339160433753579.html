      <h1>Hyper’s compact 100W GaN USB-C charger w/ built-in wall plug is great for MacBooks, iPad Pro, more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T17:58:14+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/michaelpotuck/" target="_blank">Michael Potuck</a></address>
      <p>Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology is what’s making it possible for manufacturers to create more compact chargers than ever before. Now, Hyper has launched what it’s calling the “world’s first &amp; smallest 100W GaN USB-C Charger” that features two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports and it looks like a great choice for MacBooks, iPad Pro, iPhone, and more.</p>
      <p>Hyper certainly doesn’t need to raise money to launch this product but the company has been known to use crowdfunding campaigns to help market its latest products like its <a href="https://amzn.to/2O2mnUp">iPad Pro hub</a> and much more. The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hypershop/hyperjuice-worlds-first-and-smallest-100w-gan-charger">100W GaN USB-C Charger is freshly listed on Kickstarter</a> with discounted pricing for backers. It seems to be very well, it’s already hit over $230K of its $100K goal.</p>
      <p>It offers 100W total power across the four ports (two USB-C, two USB-A) with a compact design about the size of a deck of cards. It addition to being able to charge four devices at once like <a href="https://amzn.to/2LS5Io4">MacBook, iPad Pro, iPhone</a>, and more, you can also power two MacBooks at a time.</p>
      <p>Unlike many third-party <a href="https://amzn.to/2X66T5T">multiport USB-C chargers</a>, the 100W GaN Charger includes a built-in foldable wall plug so you don’t have to remember an extra cable. It’s also travel-friendly as you can switch out the plugs for use in different countries.</p>

      <p>Hyper says it’s roughly 50% smaller than “current traditional chargers.” The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hypershop/hyperjuice-worlds-first-and-smallest-100w-gan-charger">100W GaN USB-C Charger is going for as low</a> as $49 to some backers (some tiers already sold out). Hyper is planning to ship this new compact GaN charger to backers starting in January 2020.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind there are inherent risks with Kickstarter campaigns. That said, Hyper is known for delivering on its crowdfunding campaigns over its years of making Apple accessories.</p>
