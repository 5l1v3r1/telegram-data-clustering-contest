        <b>It's thought fans were disappointed that Frank Ocean wasn't a surprise guest.</b>

      <p>Tyler, The Creator has responded after <a href="http://nme.com/artists/drake">Drake</a> was forced to cut short his surprise headline set at Tyler’s Camp Flog Gnaw Festival, after the rapper faced unrelenting booing from fans.</p>
      <p>The Canadian rapper made a surprise appearance at the event on Sunday evening in a headline slot which was also split between Lil Uzi Vert and A$AP Rocky.</p>
      <p>However, footage on social media seemingly shows Drake choosing to bring a premature end to his slot, after facing relentless criticism from fans.</p>

      <p>“I’m here for you tonight. If you wanna keep going, I will keep going”, Drake tells fans in one video.</p>
      <p>A large section of fans are then heard delivering a resounding “NO!”, before Drake eventually pulls the plug on the set.</p>
      <p>“Look. It’s been love. I love y’all. I go by the name of Drake, thank you for having me.”</p>

      <p>Now, Tyler has responded to the events, taking to his Twitter account.</p>
      <p>“I THOUGHT BRINGING ONE OF THE BIGGEST ARTIST ON THE FUCKING PLANET TO A MUSIC FESTIVAL WAS FIRE,” he wrote in his trademark all-caps tweeting style.</p>
      <p>“BUT FLIPSIDE, A LIL TONE DEAF KNOWING THE SPECIFIC CROWD IT DREW. SOME CREATED A NARRATIVE IN THEIR HEAD AND ACTED OUT LIKE ASSHOLES WHEN IT DIDNT COME TRUE AND I DONT FUCK WITH THAT.”</p>

      <p>Although the reason for the hostility from fans is yet to be properly established, some claim that they were expecting Frank Ocean to be the secret headliner – sparking anger at Drake’s arrival.</p>

      <p>One Twitter user wrote: “Soooo, the crowd at Camp Flog Gnaw booed Drake, Uzi, and Rocky off stage because they were mad the surprise guest wasn’t Frank Ocean? Who hurt ya’ll?”</p>
      <p>Other acts on Sunday’s line-up at Camp Flog Gnaw included the likes of Brockhampton, H.E.R, YG and Blood Orange.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was reported last week that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/drake-is-teasing-a-mysterious-new-project-2564994">Drake is starting his own cannabis company</a>, selling a varied selection of “cannabis products and accessories, medical cannabis, THC and CBD.”</p>
