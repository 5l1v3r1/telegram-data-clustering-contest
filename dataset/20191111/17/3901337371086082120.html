      <h1>Tau’s Brugge Assist Not Enough…</h1>

      <p>Percy Tau got his sixth assist of the season over the weekend, but it wasn’t enough for Club Brugge to extend their impressive run without defeat as they were finally beaten in Belgium.</p>

      <p>Tau was handed a starting berth for the Belgian giants on Sunday as they went into battle with Royal Antwerp, and they got off to a great start as the Bafana Bafana international set up Siebe Schrijvers for the game’s opening goal.</p>
      <p>But the second half didn’t quite go to plan for Philippe Clement’s side as they conceded a penalty that was slotted home by Dieumerci Mbokani, and after Percy Tau had been sacrificed for Emmanuel Dennis, an own goal from Simon Mignolet meant that – for the first time this season – they had been beaten.</p>
      <p>It’s not the result that Tau would have wanted before jetting out for this week’s crucial 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier with Ghana on Thursday night, however he will be pleased knowing that his side remain top of the Belgian Pro League with a five-point lead going into the international break.</p>
      <p>Tau has three goals and six assists across all competitions for Brugge this year, including his assist at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid, but he may be worried about his lack of goals of late having last scored for his club back in September. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Now though, the ‘Lion of Judah’ will be turning his attentions to the Black Stars of Ghana as Bafana eye a good start to their AFCON 2021 qualifiers, with the 25-year-old expected to start for Molefi Ntseki’s side in Cape Coast on Thursday. </p>
