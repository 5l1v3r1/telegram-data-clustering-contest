      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nawazuddin-Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Athiya-Shetty">Athiya Shetty</a>'s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Motichoor-Chaknachoor'">'Motichoor Chaknachoor'</a> has been the talk of the town. The film has been slated for the release on 15th November. However, according to the latest report, a civil court in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar">Bihar</a> has stayed the release of the film.</p>
      <p>According to the reports, one of the local distributors has claimed the rights to the film with relevant documents to support the claim. Reportedly, there have been a lot of complaints against the producer of the film, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajesh-Bhatia">Rajesh Bhatia</a> for not clearing the dues. If the reports are to be believed, the producer had sacked the director Debamitra of the film earlier.</p>
      <p>Also, Debamitra had filed a petition on Bombay High Court which had ordered a stay on the release of its trailer, over non-payment of dues by the makers of the film, however, the stay was later lifted by the court. There were reports that Athiya has not yet been paid fully!</p>
