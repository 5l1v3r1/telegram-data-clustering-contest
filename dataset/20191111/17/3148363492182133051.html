      <p>The GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/restitutions-for-baby-trump-stabber">account</a>, which was set up on Sunday, will offset the cost of Hoyt Hutchinson’s legal fees after he was charged with felony criminal mischief for allegedly slashing a “Baby Trump” balloon in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, during President Donald Trump’s trip to the University of Alabama vs. Louisiana State University football game.</p>
      <p>The balloon was set up in a nearby park when Hutchinson allegedly <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/news/baby-trump-balloon-slashed-at-alabama-appearance/">charged</a> at the balloon with a knife and <a href="https://twitter.com/delovelylany/status/1193261364174872576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1193261364174872576&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.al.com%2Fnews%2Ftuscaloosa%2F2019%2F11%2Ftrump-balloon-protest-over-after-man-stabs-balloon-arrest-made.html">slashed</a> an eight-foot-long gash in the back.</p>

      <p>Hutchinson, 32, then posted a Facebook Live video, allegedly announcing plans to destroy the inflatable Trump baby.</p>
      <p>“I’m going down here to make a scene, so y’all watch the news,” he said in the first video. “This is pathetic. I’m fixing to get rowdy.”</p>
      <p>Officers <a href="https://www.al.com/news/tuscaloosa/2019/11/trump-balloon-protest-over-after-man-stabs-balloon-arrest-made.html">arrested</a> him and charged him with one count of felony criminal mischief before booking him in the Tuscaloosa County Jail, “where he was held on a $2,500 bond,” a statement from Tuscaloosa police read.</p>
      <p>Left-wing donors spent $7,882 to bring the “Baby Trump” balloon to the Alabama-LSU game, the <i>Tuscaloosa News</i> <a href="https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20191109/suspect-accused-of-stabbing-baby-trump-balloon">reported</a>. The rental cost $4,500 and the remaining money would be donated to the Equal Justice Initiative in Montgomery.</p>
