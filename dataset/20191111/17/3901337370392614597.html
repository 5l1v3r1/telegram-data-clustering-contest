      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is planning a swoop for Crystal Palace winger Wilfried Zaha, who spent two years at United between 2013 and 2015.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed that the Eagles would demand a massive transfer fee to sell their star man, in the region of £70 million.</p>
      <p>Zaha joined the 20-time English champions from the Eagles six years ago, becoming Sir Alex Ferguson's last signing for the club, but only represented the senior team on four occasions.</p>

      <p>The Ivory Coast international might therefore be reluctant to return to the Red Devils, something he has previously admitted in interviews.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has been hesitant to even speak about his time at United, where he does not feel he was given a fair chance under Ferguson and David Moyes.</p>

      <p>Zaha, who was excellent for Palace last season, is yet to score in 13 matches in the 2019/20 campaign so far.</p>
