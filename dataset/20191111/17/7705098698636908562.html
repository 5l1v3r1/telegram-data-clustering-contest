      <p>While big screen characters Loki, Falcon, Winter Soldier, Wanda Maximoff, Vision and Hawkeye are heading to the small screen in upcoming Disney+ series, it’s always been a question as to whether the reverse will happen. Marvel President and Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige has now delivered the news that audiences can expect to see Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight and She-Hulk in MCU films!

      <p>The trio of upcoming characters are not the first previously unadapted or re-adapted properties to star in a streaming service with ties to the larger MCU. Before the Disney/Fox merger and the string of cancellations, Netflix had solo series for <b>Daredevil</b>, <b>The Punisher</b>, <b>Luke Cage</b>, <b>Jessica Jones </b>and <b>Iron Fist</b>, which all had connections to the MCU. Feige and the crew involved on the shows all teased potential crossovers with the films, both on the big and small screens, but with the cancellations and no confirmed future plans for the characters, the three will be the first to make that jump.</p>
      <p><b>She-Hulk</b> debuted in Marvel Comics’ “Savage She-Hulk” #1 in 1980, created by writer Stan Lee and artist John Buscema. Her alter ego is Jennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner/Hulk, who after being shot is provided a blood transfusion from Bruce that turns her into a similar green monster. She later became a member of the Avengers and briefly replaced Ben Grimm in The Fantastic Four.</p>
      <p><b>She-Hulk </b>is one of a slew of properties Marvel Studios is currently developing for the forthcoming streaming service Disney+, including <b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b>, <b>Loki</b>, <b>What If…?</b>, <b>WandaVision</b>, <b>Hawkeye, Moon Knight</b> and <b>Ms. Marvel.</b> The <b>Winter Soldier </b>series is set to be the first to premiere amongst the group, with the six-episode first season slated for an August 2020 debut.</p>
      <p>Created by Doug Moench and Don Perlin in 1975 for “Werewolf by Night” #32, <b>Moon Knight</b> is the alter ego of Marc Spector is a Jewish-American rabbi’s son who grew up to become a heavyweight boxer and then a U.S. Marine. Left for dead on a mission in Egypt, he’s taken to a temple devoted to the god Khonshu, and agrees to become the god’s avatar on Earth.</p>
      <p>British writer Bisha K. Ali (<b>Four Weddings and Funeral</b>) will reportedly write and act as showrunner for the <b>Ms. Marvel</b> series. An official announcement could come in just a few hours.</p>

      <p>Though the Ms. Marvel moniker has been around for decades, originally the superhero name for Carol Danvers, the Khan character took on the name. A Pakistani-American, Khan joined the Marvel comics universe back in 2014 as a result of the Inhumans’ Terrigen Mists being released, triggering her shapeshifing powers. Not only is she capable of stretching her limbs to great lengths and widths, but she can also grow or shrink to incredible sizes. Khan is also inspired by Carol Danvers, who at that point had been “promoted” to the role of Captain Marvel, and decides to take on her old moniker of Ms. Marvel to fight crime and do good.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear when the series will make its debut on the streaming service, with Marvel Studios previously announcing a host of shows for the streaming platform from 2020 up until late 2021.</p>
