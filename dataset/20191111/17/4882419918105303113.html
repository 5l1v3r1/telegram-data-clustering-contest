      <p>The Spanish football federation has reached a deal with Saudi Arabia for the Super Cup to be hosted there for the next three years.</p>
      <p>Barca, Real Madrid, Atletico and Valencia play there in January between Jan 8-12.</p>
      <p>The clubs will have the same services that are available at top level European tournaments and be hosted well by the country.</p>
      <p>Women will be allowed into the stadium in all areas according to a source at the federation.</p>
      <p>Women were allowed into the Italian Super Cup final between Juventus and Milan, although they had to sit in a special family section.</p>
      <p>The source said: “Access to fans will be open and ormolu without any exceptions for women, who will have the same conditions as in a European stadium.&amp;rdquor;</p>
      <p>Thus it fits the UEFA regulations that president Alexander Ceferin stated in September - clubs from the 55 nations that make up the European football governing body were recommended not to play games in countries where women would have restricted access.</p>
