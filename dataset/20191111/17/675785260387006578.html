      <p>A cult leader who killed his sister-in-law and niece has avoided being executed by firing squad by dying of natural causes in prison.</p>
      <p>Ronald Lafferty died today while on Death Row, according to the Utah Department of Corrections.</p>
      <p>He and his brother Dan Lafferty were convicted of killing his sister-in-law, Brenda Lafferty and her infant daughter in 1984.</p>
      <p>On the night of killings the brothers broke into Brenda and her husband's home and slit the 24-year-old's throat.</p>
      <p>Dan then did the same to his 15-month-old niece.</p>
      <p>While Dan was sentenced to life in prison in 1984, Ron was sentenced to death in 1996.</p>
      <p>In August it was reported that Ron was months away from being executed by a firing squad for the double murder.</p>
