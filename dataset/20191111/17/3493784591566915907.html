      <p><b>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP </b>this morning, at a wreath-laying ceremony at the New York City Veterans Day Parade: “Just a few weeks ago, American special forces raided the ISIS compound and brought the world’s No. 1 terrorist leader to justice. Thanks to American warriors, [Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi is dead. His second-in-charge is dead. We have our eyes on No. 3. His reign of terror is over. And our enemies are running very, very scared.”</p>
      <p><b>HOUSE REPUBLICAN RETIREMENT NO. 20* … “GOP Rep. Pete King says he won't seek reelection,” </b>by Quint Forgey and Steve Shepard: “King, a 14-term congressman first elected in 1992, said the ‘prime reason’ for his departure ‘was that after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home’ in Seaford, New York. …</p>
      <p><b>“While King’s seat is competitive,</b> he suggested his decision to step down was not driven by fear of a challenger in next year’s election, citing his support in public polling and a formidable campaign war chest. … King won reelection in 2018 by 6 percentage points, down sharply from his 17-point margin in 2016.” <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/11/republican-congressman-pete-king-wont-seek-reelection-069180">POLITICO</a></p>
      <p><b>*OUR RETIREMENT COUNT</b> includes people who are leaving the House and running for other offices.</p>
      <p><b>-- NATIONAL JOURNAL’S @AlexClearfield: </b>“#NY02: Email to me from former Rep. Rick Lazio (R), who represented part of this district from 1993-01: ‘I just heard the news about Pete King’s announcement and I will be thinking through what that means for the district - beyond the obvious.’”</p>
      <p><b>-- KING IS AS PART AND PARCEL </b>to the House Republican Conference as anyone. He’s been a leading voice in national security issues, and a close ally of the leadership for years. His Long Island district is going to be very competitive. It was long thought that his daughter, local pol Erin King Sweeney, would be a leading candidate for the seat. But King noted this morning that she had moved to North Carolina.</p>
      <p><b>-- @SenSchumer: </b>“Peter King stood head &amp; shoulders above everyone else […] He’s been principled &amp; never let others push him away from his principles […] He’s fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3 […] I will miss him in Congress &amp; value his friendship.”</p>
      <p><b>Good Monday afternoon. THE L.A. TIMES</b> has corrected a quote from Pete Buttigieg that we cited in this morning’s Playbook. The LAT originally misquoted him as talking about the “failures of the Obama era.” He actually referred to “failures of the old normal.” <b><a href="https://twitter.com/evanhalper/status/1193852080903065600"><i>More</i></a></b></p>

      <p><b>UKRAINE THE SWAMP -- “After push from Perry, backers got huge gas deal in Ukraine,” </b>by AP’s Desmond Butler in Kyiv, Michael Biesecker, Stephen Braun and Richard Lardner: “Ukraine awarded the contract to Perry’s supporters little more than a month after the U.S. energy secretary attended Zelenskiy’s May inauguration. In a meeting during that trip, Perry handed the new president a list of people he recommended as energy advisers. One of the four names was his longtime political backer Michael Bleyzer.</p>
      <p><b>“A week later, Bleyzer and his partner Alex Cranberg</b> submitted a bid to drill for oil and gas at a sprawling government-controlled site called Varvynska. They offered millions of dollars less to the Ukrainian government than their only competitor for the drilling rights … The sequence of events suggests the Trump administration’s political maneuvering in Ukraine was entwined with the big business of the energy trade.” <a href="https://apnews.com/6d8ae551fb884371a2a592ed85a74426">AP</a></p>

Citizens of Denmark, Germany and France would also be sent back to their countries in the coming days, he added. … Turkey said it had captured hundreds of militants over the last few weeks.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-begins-deporting-suspected-islamic-state-militants-including-us-citizen/2019/11/11/5414d4a2-045d-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html">WaPo</a></p>
      <p><b>THE BRAVE NEW WORLD -- “How GOP-linked PR firms use Google’s ad platform to harvest email addresses,” </b>by Engadget’s Sam Baker: “What’s the seventh largest purchaser of US political ads on Google right now? After the Republican Senate and Congressional Leadership Funds and the Trump campaign, comes a group called DedicatedEmails.com –- a limited-liability company specializing in digital marketing for clients looking to attract new customers via ‘opt-in email lists.’ …</p>
      <p><b>“The ads appear to be geared towards collecting</b> potential voter email addresses and directing people to questionable news sites. The emails people receive after signing up are either miracle health cures, secret new ways to boost your income or scary news about savings and the latest socialist coming to take them. According to Google’s political advertising transparency report, DedicatedEmails.com has spent over $3.5 million on more than 3,400 Google ads … to date -- promoting poll questions that ultimately ask for email addresses. …</p>
      <p><b>“In a joint Engadget and Point investigation,</b> we found at least three companies actively placing these types of ads connected to incendiary ‘news’ sites, one of which is run by a Republican donor and another that was registered by a former Trump campaign lawyer.” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/google-political-ads-polls-email-collection/">Engadget</a></p>

      <p><b>IMMIGRATION FILES -- “How the Trump Administration Eroded Its Own Legal Case on DACA,” </b>by NYT’s Michael Shear, Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Adam Liptak: “At a contentious meeting in the White House Roosevelt Room [in 2017], Elaine C. Duke, then the acting secretary of homeland security, had broken with the rest of Mr. Trump’s team and balked at its demand that she issue a memo ending Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that shields immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. …</p>
      <p><b>“Immigrant rights groups suing Mr. Trump have now zeroed in</b> on the refusal by Ms. Duke, who resigned in early 2018 shortly after a permanent secretary was named, as evidence to bolster their defense of the program. Lawyers for the groups say the back story of her memo has shaped the oral arguments they will make to the justices on Tuesday. If they are persuasive, the court could rule against Mr. Trump in June, just as he enters the final stretch of his re-election campaign.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/supreme-court-dreamers-case.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NYT</a></p>
      <p><b>-- WSJ: “Migrants Find Different Fates at Texas, Arizona Borders,” </b>by Alicia Caldwell in Tuscon: “Now some migrants are heading to Arizona as word spreads that they are far more likely to be allowed to stay in the U.S. there than if they cross in Texas, New Mexico, or California. … Customs and Border Protection, which includes the Border Patrol, confirmed that [the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy] isn’t in place in Arizona.” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/migrants-find-different-fates-at-texas-arizona-borders-11573480818?mod=hp_lead_pos9">WSJ</a></p>
      <p><b>PACIFIC TENSIONS -- “U.S. Military Chief Urges South Korea Not to Quit Pact With Japan,” </b>by WSJ’s Gordon Lubold and Alastair Gale in Tokyo: “Gen. Mark Milley, who is visiting Japan and South Korea on his first overseas trip as chairman, told reporters on a military jet before landing in Japan on Monday that strong three-way military coordination was needed to face threats in the region.</p>
      <p><b>“‘It is clearly in China’s interest, and in North Korea’s interest,</b> to separate South Korea from Japan and the United States, and it’s in our interest to keep all three of them very closely aligned,’ he said. The agreement, introduced in 2016, allows Seoul and Tokyo to directly share intelligence, such as information on North Korean missile tests, rather than going through the U.S.” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-chief-urges-south-korea-not-to-quit-pact-with-japan-11573474440?mod=hp_listb_pos2">WSJ</a></p>
      <p><b>CABINET ROUNDUP … KNOWING SONNY PERDUE -- “Trump’s trade wars are hurting farmers. Can Sonny Perdue keep them happy?” </b>by WaPo’s Annie Gowen and William Wan: “Perdue — speaking in a state that lost nearly two dairy farms a day last year — remarked [last month] that small farms would not likely survive as the ‘big get bigger and small go out.’ The remark reverberated across the country, prompting calls for his resignation from farm groups, angry editorials and even criticism from his own party. …</p>
      <p><b>“Over the last year, Perdue has emerged as</b> President Trump’s key evangelist in bruising trade wars, traveling the country to give folksy pep talks to frustrated farmers who have seen their incomes drop and exports hit hard by tariff disputes. … As the head of USDA, Perdue has been a disrupter in the Trump mold. … Internally he’s been praised for his relentless promotion of the administration’s agenda. … But patience is waning for Perdue’s sunny bromides in rural America, where farm bankruptcies and loan delinquencies are rising.” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/trumps-trade-wars-are-hurting-farmers-can-sonny-perdue-keep-them-happy/2019/11/10/d15a54d1-6102-42f5-969b-9ef73feb525d_story.html">WaPo</a></p>
      <p><b>-- KNOWING BETSY DEVOS: “Betsy DeVos Might Outlast Them All,” </b>by HuffPost’s Rebecca Klein: “For the most part, despite her wild unpopularity, [sources] chalk up DeVos’ success to President Donald Trump’s relative disinterest in education, her comparative lack of ethical conflicts and scandal, and her connections to the evangelical community, a group that serves as an important voting bloc for the president. But they also point to her wholehearted belief in the righteousness of her agenda and persistence in seeing it through.” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/betsy-devos-longevity_n_5dc59db3e4b00927b2326f99?0ld">HuffPost</a></p>
      <p><b>2020 WATCH -- “Andrew Yang’s Campaign Has a Lot of Money. Now What?” </b>by NYT’s Matt Stevens in Concord, N.H.: “Enthusiasm for Mr. Yang is probably most palpable here in New Hampshire where the entrepreneur has repeatedly polled around 5 percent, his strongest showing in an early-voting state. … He raised $10 million in the third quarter and has more than $6 million still in the bank — the sixth most of any Democratic candidate as of the end of September. …</p>
      <p><b>“[M]oving forward, Mr. Yang said he wants his message</b> to become ‘more human based’ — perhaps a necessary shift for a candidate seeking a broader audience who has thus far focused much of his attention on robots. His vision of a ‘human based’ campaign, he said, involves talking more about the way he thinks his signature pitch can really change lives.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/politics/andrew-yang-campaign.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NYT</a></p>

      <p><b>THE KREMLIN’S LONG REACH -- “How Russia Meddles Abroad for Profit: Cash, Trolls and a Cult Leader,” </b>by NYT’s Michael Schwirtz and Gaelle Borgia in Antananarivo, Madagascar: “Of all the places for Russia to try to swing a presidential election, Madagascar is perhaps one of the least expected. … But two years after the Russians’ aggressive interference in the United States, here they were, determined to expand their clout and apply their special brand of election meddling to a distant political battleground.</p>
      <p><b>“The operation was approved by President Vladimir V. Putin</b> and coordinated by some of the same figures who oversaw the disinformation around the 2016 American presidential election, according to dozens of interviews with officials in Madagascar, local operatives hired to take part in the Russian campaign and hundreds of pages of internal documents produced by the Russian operatives.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/world/africa/russia-madagascar-election.html">NYT</a></p>

The construction on Gogland, in the Gulf of Finland, adds a new military launchpad in a region that could be front line in any conflict between Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/on-a-rocky-island-russia-seeks-military-and-psychological-edge-11573480984?mod=hp_listb_pos2">WSJ</a></p>
      <p><b>BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- “New Normal in Key State for 2020 Race: Political Deadlock,” </b>by NYT’s Mitch Smith in Madison, Wis.: “The governor of Wisconsin called a special session last week to debate gun legislation. It resulted in exactly zero new laws, and it lasted less than a minute. Such is life these days in Wisconsin, a state that for much of the last decade was a laboratory for some of the nation’s most conservative policymaking and a hotbed of partisan fervor, but where pretty much everything has now slowed to a crawl.</p>
      <p><b>“Acrimonious deadlocks have become the new normal in Wisconsin,</b> one of three Midwestern states where Democrats ended full Republican control last year by flipping governorships. … Yet with attention turning to the presidential election, in which Wisconsin voters are seen as playing a decisive role, divided power has given way to frustrated impasse, with little chance for either party to hold up state policymaking as the showcase it once was here.” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/us/wisconsin-divided-government.html?action=click&amp;module=News&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NYT</a></p>
