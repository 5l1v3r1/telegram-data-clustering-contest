      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese forward has endured a tough time in Italy of late, having been substituted in both of Juventus' past two matches.</p>
      <p>On Sunday night, in the Bianconeri's 1-0 Serie A win over AC Milan, <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-hasn-t-dribbled-past-anyone-in-years/Frustrated%20CR7%20Storms%20Off%20Pitch,%20Leaves%20Stadium?%20Sarri%20Responds">Ronaldo once again reacted furiously</a> to being taken off by Maurizio Sarri in the 55th minute, heading straight down the tunnel to the dressing room after making his way off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Following the match and the 34-year-old's reaction, former Juve boss Fabio Capello praised Sarri's decision to take off the Portugal talisman.</p>

      <p>"I didn't like this, it wasn't nice," he told <i>Sky Sport Italia.</i></p>
      <p>"He (Ronaldo) must be a champion even when he comes off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"The truth is that Cristiano Ronaldo hasn't dribbled (past) an opponent for three years. I did the La Liga commentary when he usually took the double-step and left you there.</p>
      <p>"Inside him is a super-champion, the best of all, but now there is Dybala and Douglas Costa, who made two sensational goals. Dybala, in excellent condition, can make the difference, as can Douglas Costa.</p>
      <p>"They win games without Ronaldo. Juve seemed dependent on him, instead the great squad and the quality of the players helps them win anyway.</p>
      <p>"Bravo Sarri, who had the courage to take him off, it takes personality, especially thinking that all the players in the squad can play and make a difference.</p>
      <p>"Cristiano did it for a while, but now it's not him and he must recover, especially on a physical level. He does not have the speed and dynamism he has shown at other times."</p>
