      <p>DARIEN, Connecticut (WABC) -- A Connecticut man charged in the death of a hotel worker in Anguilla has declined to return to the British Caribbean territory for the latest pretrial hearing.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://abc7ny.com/man-who-killed-anguilla-hotel-worker-appears-in-court/5485335/">Scott Hapgood</a> says Anguillan officials have not given assurances that his client would be allowed to return home on bond. Spokesman Jamie Diaferia says there also have been death threats against Hapgood.</p>
      <p>Hapgood and his family say a hotel worker, Kenny Mitchel, showed up at their room unannounced during their April vacation and demanded money before attacking them. Mitchel died, and Hapgood was charged with manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Elected officials, including U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, had expressed concern about Hapgood's safety.</p>
      <p>Diaferia said Anguilla officials rejected an offer for Hapgood to appear by video link for Monday's hearing.</p>
      <p>Hapgood was vacationing with his wife and children when he says the 27-year-old Mitchel showed up claiming he needed to fix a broken sink.</p>
      <p>In a written account Hapgood provided to the New York Times, he claims soon after he let Mitchel inside, the worker "pulled a knife on me, demanding my money and my wallet."</p>
      <p>A struggle ensued, with Hapgood ultimately killing Mitchel. A toxicology report showed that Mitchel had drugs and alcohol in his system the night he died.</p>
