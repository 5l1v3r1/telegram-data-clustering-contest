      <h3>PEP TALK</h3>
      <p>Short of dashing out of his technical area to procure a tree branch with which to give Mike Dean a damned good thrashing, it’s difficult to imagine quite how Pep Guardiola could have gone more Basil Fawlty on the fourth official during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/10/liverpool-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City’s defeat</a> at the hands of Liverpool yesterday.</p>
      <p>More specifically, it was the hands of Trent Alexander-Arnold that Pep felt had cost his team, what with the young full-back pawing the ball twice in his own penalty area but getting away with it on both occasions. Harsh decisions? “That is to the referees,” said Pep. But they were harsh decisions, eh? “Ask the referees please, not to me,” he replied. But surely you must have an opinion, Pep? “Ask Mike Reilly and the guys who are in the VAR, don’t ask me,” he insisted, sounding not unlike a captive soldier refusing to divulge any information other than his name, rank and service number.</p>
      <p>While he probably won’t care, Pep learned today that he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/11/manchester-city-better-liverpool-luck-rodri">won’t face censure</a> for ostentatiously shouting “THANK YOU <i>SOOOO</i> MUCH!!!” at referee Michael Oliver while pumping the official’s hand shortly after the final whistle. Showing rare self-awareness, the FA decided that levelling a charge of “expressing sarcastic gratitude” might send him over the edge altogether, not least because it would be impossible to defend oneself against such a charge without sounding even more like Kevin The Teenager than at the time of the original alleged offence.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters after the game, Rodri claimed his side were vastly superior over the course of the 90 minutes, although it remains to be seen if the FA haul in the City midfielder to answer charges of sarcastic excuse-making. “I think we were much better overall,” he said. “We created more chances than them, but they arrive to our goal three times and scored three goals. We are leaving with a bittersweet feeling, because we wanted to win.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for Rodri and chums, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a> also wanted to win and did so in fine style, prompting their manager to sing his side’s praises. “I am so proud of my team more than ever,” said Jürgen Klopp. “To make this performance against the strongest team in Europe – so proud. I am so proud, we played so good.” Actually, hang on … it was actually Pep who said that and on this occasion we <i>think</i> he actually meant it. With sarcasm being the brain’s natural defence against the less intelligent, it’s small wonder the Fiver has spent all day feeling more than a mite confused.</p>
      <h3>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h3>
      <p>“I love my race, I fight for colour, whatever I do is for us, for love … I will never shut up in the face of such an inhuman and despicable act! My tears were of indignation, repudiation and helplessness, helplessness that I could do nothing at that moment. But we are taught very early to be strong and to fight! Fight for our rights and for equality! My role is to fight, to beat my chest, to lift my head and keep fighting always. In a racist society, it is not enough not to be racist, we must be anti-racist. Football needs more respect, the world needs more respect!” – Shakhtar’s Taison makes a statement after being sent off for responding to racist abuse from Dynamo Kyiv fans. The Brazilian player gave the crowd the finger and booted the match-ball into the stands, for which he was shown a red card.</p>
