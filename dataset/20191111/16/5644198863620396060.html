      <p>WASHINGTON: The United States urged Iraqi authorities to hold early polls and carry out electoral reforms and called for an end to the violence that has left <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/iraqi-forces-push-protesters-back-to-main-square-kill-five-12078714">hundreds of protesters dead</a>.</p>
      <p>Washington wants "the Iraqi government to halt the violence against protesters and fulfil President (Barham) Saleh's promise to pass electoral reform and hold early elections," the White House said in a statement Sunday (Nov 10).</p>

      <p>"The United States is seriously concerned by continued attacks against protestors, civic activists and the media, as well as restrictions on internet access, in Iraq," it said.</p>

      <p>Mass rallies calling for an overhaul of the ruling system have rocked the capital Baghdad and the Shiite-majority south since Oct 1, but political forces closed ranks this week to defend the government.</p>
      <p>In a televised address last month, Saleh had proposed an early vote after reforms, but the suggestion seems to have been widely rejected by Iraq's political class.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi cast them as unrealistic and even firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr, who first demanded snap elections supervised by the United Nations last month, has gone silent.</p>
      <p>In a meeting on Sunday among the country's top leaders, the president, premier and speaker of parliament agreed on reforming Iraq's electoral system but made no mention of an early vote.</p>
      <p>The initial fissures among the political elite appear to have closed this week following a series of meetings led by Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' foreign operations arm.</p>
      <p>A source close to the top decision-makers told AFP that Saleh had angered neighbouring Iran by suggesting the premier could resign.</p>
      <p>Parliament's human rights committee says that 319 people have been killed since protests first erupted, including demonstrators and security forces.</p>
      <p>The committee said snipers were active near protest sites and hunting rifles were used against demonstrators as well.</p>
