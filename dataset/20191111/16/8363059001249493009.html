      <p>OnePlus users beware: WhatsApp will (probably) drain your battery.</p>
      <p>According to posts on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dsx1zq/psa_there_seems_to_be_a_huge_battery_drain_issue/">Reddit</a> and the <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/whatsapp-uses-a-lot-of-battery-since-android-10-upgrade.1136495/">OnePlus official forums</a>, the latest version of WhatsApp (v.2.19.308, which dropped at the end of last month) is seriously eating into the battery life of a whole range of OnePlus phones, including the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/oneplus-7t-series-on-sale-now/">OnePlus 7T series</a> that only arrived in October. The issue is affecting devices running either Android 9 or 10 and those hit by it are seeing up to 50 per cent of their battery life being consumed by WhatsApp, even overnight.</p>
      <p>Users have found various workarounds for fixing something the developers should really have caught before releasing the app into the wild, including force-stopping WhatsApp when it's not being used. This admittedly defeats the purpose of the always-on messaging app WhatsApp is supposed to be, but at least stops it from killing your battery overnight.</p>
      <p>The problem seems to have been fixed in the latest version of WhatsApp (v.2.19.325), which hasn't yet hit the Google Play Store, but you can <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/android/">download it direct from WhatsApp</a> if you're one of those affected.
