        <b>Ahmed Shehzad who failed to capitalize on a couple of opportunities against Sri Lanka but failed accepted his fault as he vowed to comeback stronger. Further he requested the fans not to club him with Umar Akmal as they are two different individuals while he wondered why fans are annoyed with him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As international cricket returned to Pakistan, so did Shehzad as he returned to the side after a prolonged absence from the team due to a drug ban. But the comeback wasn't quite as expected as the opener was only able to muster 17 runs in two matches. </p>
      <p>Talking about his performance, Shehzad admitted that he has no one to blame for his failure at a press conference in Lahore.</p>
      <p>"I got two chances. I think one should be prepared enough to avail whatever chances that come their way, be it one or two,” Geo TV quoted Shehzad.</p>
      <p>“I believe that the amount of hard work I put in in the last two years, I had never done it in my entire life. It was unfortunate. I tried but it did not happen. Fair enough. Maybe God wants some more hard work from me.</p>
      <p>“I cannot give excuses. I cannot say that I only got two matches and someone else got five of 10. I will try to do more next time whenever I get the chance.”</p>
      <p>Shehzad also voiced his disappointment on being compared with his teammate <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/umar_akmal">Umar Akmal</a> saying that both of us are different individuals and shouldn't be clubbed together.</p>
      <p>“He has his own life, I have mine. I request that we be not get lumped together as a duo. I should be judged on what I do and he on his own conduct. It would also be unfair on him if I were to make a mistake but the blame was to fall on him,” he said.</p>
      <p>Shehzad was left wondering why fans are so annoyed with him. Shehzad was recently fined as his team was found tampering with the ball in a Quaid-e-Azam Trophy fixture, which he clearly denied.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes[the critics] get too harsh,” he said. “Sometimes it feels like I have come from elsewhere or I am not from this country. I have no idea why people are so annoyed with me. I have always tried to improve myself."</p>
      <p>While his critics may already think that he has played his last for Pakistan, the man himself says he still has a comeback left in him.</p>
      <p>“Some players get a match or two and then are never seen again, but I have already had six to seven comebacks. I will work even harder and come back better than ever,” he vowed.</p>
