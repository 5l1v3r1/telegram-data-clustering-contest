      <h1>Canadian company reports fatality in a rock fall at Mexican mine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:34:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>Vancouver-based Great Panther Mining Ltd. says a contractor's employee was killed at its San Ignacio underground mine in Mexico.</p>
      <p>The intermediate gold and silver mining company says the fatality occurred Friday afternoon during an isolated rock fall at the mine, which is part of its Guanajuato Mine Complex.</p>
      <p>It says the employee's family and government authorities have been notified and an investigation has been initiated to determine the cause.</p>
      <p>Great Panther says operations in the area of the incident have been temporarily suspended but the rest of the mine is unaffected.</p>
      <p>The company operates the Tucano Gold Mine in Brazil and two primary silver mines in Mexico: Guanajuato and Topia.</p>
      <p>Great Panther bought the Coricancha Mine in Peru in 2017 and is working to restart it after it was shut down in 2013.</p>
      <p>"We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our colleagues and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends," said interim CEO Jeffrey Mason in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We will commit all available resources to determine the cause of this accident so that we can work to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again. Any necessary steps to prevent the recurrence of such accidents will be taken immediately."</p>
