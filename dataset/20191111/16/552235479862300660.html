      <h1>Child and pet-proof Christmas tree that starts half-way up is on sale at Argos</h1>
      <h2>If you’re worried about decorations ending up on the floor this Christmas, this is the tree for you</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:27:27+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Linda Howard</a></address>
      <p>Most of us are patiently counting down the days until we can start looking out the Christmas decorations and begin filling our homes with festive feels.</p>
      <p>While most of us look forward to putting up the tree and buying new baubles and decorations to make it extra special, there are those out there filled with fear at the prospect.</p>
      <p>Anyone with small children or pets may be dreading this time of year as the Christmas tree becomes an unmissable attraction for those who want to grab the decorations or even pull the whole thing down.</p>
      <p>The shiny baubles can be irresistible for cats and toddlers while low-hanging chocolate lures inquisitive dogs.</p>
      <p>Well, <a href="https://fave.co/2OSJL8Y">Argos</a> has once again stepped up to the challenge and, following in last year’s footsteps, is once again selling a <a href="https://fave.co/36VL1io">Snowy Half Christmas Tree</a> .</p>
      <p>The artificial tree stands 6ft tall, the same as most standard ones and costs <a href="https://fave.co/36VL1io">£45</a> , but the branches and the decorations start half way up, reports <a href="https://www.rsvplive.ie/life/argos-ireland-selling-absolutely-genius-20823746?_ga=2.9801973.1598934564.1573459276-990669471.1561716015">RSVP</a> .</p>
      <p>The additional height means toddlers and pets can’t reach the branches which also leaves more room to pile up presents underneath.</p>

      <p>The official <a href="https://fave.co/2OSJL8Y">Argos</a> description reads: "Don't let the cat ruin Christmas! Designed with curious cats (and toddlers! ) in mind, this 6ft tree starts a little higher than most. With the first branches at 93cm, it's a great way to keep your perfectly placed baubles and twinkly tinsel out of reach.</p>
      <p>"This means that the half tree only needs half the decorating! It also means you can pile more presents underneath it! Finished with a light dusting of snow, when you've built your tree we recommend you spend a little time fluffing up the branches to make sure they're thick and full."</p>
      <p>Happy customers have been leaving positive reviews praising the design concept with one writing: "If you have toddlers you need this. No more picking up baubles and redecorating the tree numerous times a day,this is going to save my baubles....and my sanity! The tree is lovely and bushy too and easy to decorate,what more could I ask for :) "</p>
      <p>Another said: "This tree is so lovely, and cat proof!!! (well, almost) I have 5 cats and spent most of last Christmas picking ornaments off the floor. This year only one cat climbed the post and into the tree. The tree itself is well made and of good quality. I got lots of compliments from friends and family."</p>
      <p><a href="https://fave.co/2OSJL8Y">Argos</a> is also selling a <a href="https://fave.co/2Ka9IOg">6ft Half Parasol Christmas Tree for £40</a> in luscious green, without the snow-tipped effect.</p>
