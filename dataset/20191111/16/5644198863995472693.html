      <p>HANOI: A court in Vietnam sentenced a 70-year-old Vietnamese-Australian man on Monday (Nov 11) to 12 years in prison after finding him guilty of "terrorism", a lawyer who attended the trial told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on its official news website that Chau Van Kham was being tried for being a member of the US-based human rights group Viet Tan, which Vietnam regards as a "terrorist" body. It made no mention of the verdict.</p>

      <p>It said Kham had helped raised funds for anti-state activities, joined anti-Vietnam protests in Australia and recruited members for Viet Tan.</p>
      <p>Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism from both within and outside Vietnam.</p>
      <p>The People's Court of Ho Chi Mih City also ordered Kham, a retired baker from New South Wales of Vietnamese origin, to be deported after serving the sentence, lawyer Nguyen Van Mieng said.</p>
      <p>"At the trial, Kham said he loves Vietnam and doesn't have any intention to carry out terrorism activities in the country," Mieng said. "The prosecutors stuck to the idea that he's a member of Viet Tan to charge him with terrorism."</p>
      <p>"The jail terms for political prisoners are getting longer and longer," added Mieng, who is representing a co-defendant of Kham.</p>
      <p>Kham entered Vietnam from Cambodia in January this year when he gave US$400 to a man named Nguyen Van Vien to fund the operations of Viet Tan, according to the police statement.</p>
      <p>"This is a very serious case of national security infringement led by Viet Tan's key people," it said.</p>
      <p>In a statement published last week, Viet Tan dismissed the case as a "sham trial".</p>
      <p>"Viet Tan will continue to support human rights defenders on the ground. Chau Van Kham entered Vietnam to gain first-hand insight into the human rights situation in the country," the organisation's chairman, Do Hoang Diem, said in the statement.</p>
      <p>According to Vietnamese police, Kham, a navy veteran of the now defunct US-backed state of South Vietnam, sought asylum in Malaysia after leaving Vietnam in 1975 before moving to Australia in 1983.</p>
      <p>Last week, a Ho Chi Minh City appeals court upheld a 12-year prison sentence against U.S. citizen Michael Nguyen who had been found guilty of "attempting to overthrow the state".</p>
