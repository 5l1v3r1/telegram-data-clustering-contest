      <p>Obviously I’m talking about the much-awaited return of <i>You</i>, with Netflix having just announced season two will be available to watch on the streaming service on December 26.</p>
      <p>In other words, Joe will return to our screens on Boxing Day which, in case you’re wondering, is 44 days away (or 1,056 hours/633,60 minutes if you really want to get into the nitty gritty of it).</p>

      <p>As per <i><a href="https://entertainment.ie/tv/netflix/you-season-2-date-announced-netflix-429173/">entertainment.ie</a></i>, Penn Badgley will be reprising his role as Joe in the upcoming series but has headed away from the scene of his last crime towards Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>As such, and due to his last intense (stalker-ish) relationship with Beck (Elizabeth Lail) ending in her murder, season two is set to feature brand new actors – although Joe’s long lost ex-girlfriend Candace, who we only saw snippets of in season one, will be returning.</p>
      <p>The second season will see Candace (played by Ambyr Childers) attempting to teach her ex a lesson, although viewers will see Joe become obsessed with yet another woman named Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Netflix released a new poster for the upcoming series earlier today (November 11):</b>

      <p>Love, an aspiring chef who’s working in an unfulfilling job, is working through her own feelings of grief when she meets Joe in LA. According to <i><a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-11-08/you-season-2-netflix-release-date/">Radio Times</a></i>, the young woman senses Joe has also lost someone – although she could never guess the gruesome truth.</p>
      <p>Other new cast members include Melanie Field as Sunrise, ‘a stay at home mommy blogger raising a toddler’, and Marielle Scott as her partner Lucy, an ‘edgy-chic literary agent’ with a deadpan sense of humour.</p>
      <p>Magda Apanowicz will star as Sandy, described only as ‘a woman from Joe’s past’, and Charlie Barnett as Gabe, the best friend of Love Quinn. Love’s brother, Forty Quinn – ‘confident, opinionated and privileged’ – will be played by James Scully.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking at all of this and thinking season two sounds like an entirely different show, you wouldn’t be too far off from the truth.</p>
      <p>In a previous interview with <i><a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/on-demand/2019-05-03/you-season-1-ending-netflix-beck-death-elizabeth-lail-reacts/">Radio Times</a></i>, Elizabeth Lail said she was ‘sad’ to not continue the journey with co-star Penn Badgley, but admitted it wouldn’t be the same anyway.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The actor explained:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>I am sad to not continue that journey with him, but it’s only him, and I think they’re shooting it in LA, and so nothing will be the same. Hardly anything. It’ll be a whole other story.</blockquote>
