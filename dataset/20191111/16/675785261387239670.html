      <h1>Paul Pogba has ankle cast removed as Man Utd midfielder edges closer to return</h1>
      <h2>The World Cup winner has been sidelined since the end of the September, but could soon be back playing for the Red Devils</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> have been handed a big boost after midfielder <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-pogba">Paul Pogba</a> had his ankle cast removed on Monday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fifa-world-cup">World Cup</a> winner has been sidelined since the end of September after aggravating a long-standing ankle issue in Utd's 1-1 draw at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> .</p>
      <p>During the international break in October, the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> man headed to Dubai for some warm weather training in a bid to get over the niggle, but was unable to do so.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/france-football-team">France</a> international subsequently had a cast fitted around his ankle in order to aid his recovery and the 26-year-old passed a huge landmark in his rehabilitation on Monday.</p>

      <p>Pogba travelled to Amsterdam to have the cast removed and recorded the procedure, with the clip later uploaded to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman could be seen smiling as the cast was taken off using a drill, no doubt knowing a frustrating period in his career will soon be over.</p>
      <p>However, the 26-year-old is still a few weeks away from making a playing return with Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer himself admitting earlier this month that Pogba will likely not be back until early December.</p>

      <p>It means the ex-Juve man will spend the next few weeks building his fitness up, with the Manchester derby against fierce rivals City on December 7 a possible date for his return.</p>
      <p>In Pogba's absence, Scott McTominay and Fred have begun building a good partnership in the heart of the pitch for the Red Devils and the Frenchman may have a battle on his hand to regain his starting spot.</p>

      <p>Brazil international Fred has been a revelation for Utd in recent weeks and Solskjaer was full of praise for the midfielder following a win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> at the weekend.</p>
      <p>"He set us off today with his midfield play, we won the ball, had to get after them," said the Norwegian.</p>
