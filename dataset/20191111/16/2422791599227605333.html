      <p>TORONTO - Canada will not have Milos Raonic on its roster for the inaugural Davis Cup Finals next week in Madrid because of a back injury.</p>
      <p>The veteran pro from Thornhill, Ont., has struggled with injuries in recent years. Raonic missed the U.S. Open because of a back injury and has played just three official matches this fall.</p>
      <p>"It is very hard and disappointing for me that I will not be able to represent my country at Davis Cup," Raonic said Monday in a statement. "My health has continued to let me down through this entire year and now once again. I will take the appropriate time to get healthy and I look forward to being back on court next season."</p>
      <p>Brayden Schnur of Pickering, Ont., will replace the 31st-ranked Raonic. Schnur has climbed 100 spots in the rankings this year and is currently at No. 94.</p>
      <p>Schnur will be joined by No. 15 Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., No. 21 Felix Auger-Aliassime of Montreal and No. 149 Vasek Pospisil of Vancouver.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy to be able to play in the Davis Cup Finals but, of course, I first want to wish Milos a speedy recovery," Schnur said. "It's an honour for me to represent Canada in this team competition."</p>
