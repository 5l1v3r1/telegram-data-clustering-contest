      <h1>Tsitsipas battles past Medvedev as Nadal readies for ATP Finals bow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:24:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>LONDON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Stefanos-Tsitsipas">Stefanos Tsitsipas</a> broke his hoodoo against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Daniil-Medvedev">Daniil Medvedev</a> on Monday as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rafael-Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> prepared to launch his bid for a first ATP Finals title with questions over his fitness.</p>
      <p>The Greek 21-year-old came into the match at London's O2 Arena with a 5-0 losing record against his Russian opponent weighing on him.</p>
      <p>But he edged a tight first set, winning the tie-break, and a single break late in the second set proved decisive in a 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 victory.</p>
      <p>There was little to choose between the players in a match dominated by serve but Medvedev fatally chose to leave a ball in the ninth game of the second set that landed in, handing Tsitsipas a break point which he seized, going on to wrap up victory.</p>
      <p>The pair have a spiky relationship.</p>
      <p>Tensions flared between them at the 2018 Miami Open and Tsitsipas recently labelled Medvedev's way of winning as "boring" after defeat against the Russian in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>World number four Medvedev is looking to add lustre to an impressive breakout year by winning the glitzy end-of-season event in London.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old Russian has emerged as the leader of the pack of young tyros preparing to unseat the old guard of Nadal, Novak Djokovic and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roger-Federer">Roger Federer</a>.</p>
      <p>Four of the eight competitors at the ATP Finals at the O2 Arena are under 24 for the first time in 10 years.</p>
      <p>Nadal, takes on defending champion Alexander Zverev in the later match in Group <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andre-Agassi">Andre Agassi</a> with major questions over his fitness since he withdrew injured from the Paris Masters at the semi-final stage.</p>
      <p>The Spanish top seed is locked in a battle with Djokovic to finish as the year-end number one.</p>
      <p>Regardless of Djokovic's results this week, Nadal will clinch the year-end top spot for a fifth time if he reaches the final with a 4-0 record.</p>
      <p>Nadal has qualified 15 straight times for the year-end championships but he has only made eight prior appearances due to injuries.</p>
      <p>Djokovic launched his bid for a sixth ATP Finals title with a comfortable win against Matteo Berrettini on Sunday but Federer slipped to a straight-sets defeat against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dominic-Thiem">Dominic Thiem</a>, putting his hopes of progress in serious jeopardy.</p>
