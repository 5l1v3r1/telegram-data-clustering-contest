      <p>Junior finance minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/anurag-thakur">Anurag Thakur </a>on Monday asked banks to ensure smooth flow of credit to MSMEs which are in genuine need of funds.</p>
      <p>It can be noted that despite many measures announced by successive governments, small businesses continue to face funding issues, as banks don't chase them as they do with large companies for a variety of reasons.</p>
      <p>"Banks should also focus on genuine customers who need financial support to grow their businesses and the MSME sector, which is the backbone of our economy, needs a lot of support from the banking industry," he said at the 101st foundation day celebrations of the state-run Union Bank of India here this evening.</p>
      <p>Listing out the slew of reforms taken in the banking sector, he said, "we have adopted the four R approach to resolve the balance sheet issues of banks: recognising, resolving and recovering, recapitalising and reforms".</p>
      <p>As a result, bad loans have come down from Rs 10.36 lakh crore in March 2018 to Rs 9.38 lakh crore in March 2019 system-wide, while for public sector banks, the same has come down to Rs 7.9 lakh crore from Rs 8.96 lakh crore.</p>
      <p>He also asked banks to genuine commercial decisions without fear of witch-hunt later.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Union Bank managing director Rajkiran Rai G said, through the hundred years journey, the bank has been serving national priorities.</p>
      <p>The bank launched three new products--Union Sampurna- a technology to provide one-stop solution for farm sector; e- way bills and an ATM geo-locator.</p>
