      <h2>Katie Price's estranged third husband Kieran Hayler has well and truly moved on - and is fuelling speculation he and Michelle Pentecost are ready for their next chapter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:24:31+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Emmeline Saunders</a></address>
      <p>Kieran Hayler seems happier than ever now he's moved on from his turbulent marriage to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> and into the arms of new love Michelle Pentecost.</p>
      <p>And it looks like the happy couple are ready to open the next chapter of their life together, after he sparked rumours they are expecting a baby together.</p>
      <p>This weekend saw Kieran treat Michelle to a birthday pampering session, whisking her out for a romantic meal after they'd shared a pub lunch with her son and his two kids, Jett and Bunny.</p>
      <p>And he even surprised her by dressing up as a police officer - complete with bullet-proof vest and aviator sunglasses - to reprise his old stripping act.</p>
      <p>"Guess who got her own personal show tonight, back for one night only," Kieran joked on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>

      <p>The pair were spotted getting cosy in a car park after their romantic meal, where Kieran tenderly cupped his girlfriend's stomach as she smiled up at him.</p>
      <p>Birthday girl Michelle showed off her figure in a gold mini-dress, teaming it with a black faux-fur coat and a pair of teetering nude heels.</p>
      <p>She accessorised with a black designer clutch bag and delicate gold rings on her fingers.</p>
      <p>Michelle wore her long brunette locks down in loose waves and finished off her glam going-out look with a slick of raspberry lipstick.</p>

      <p>She and Kieran first got together in summer 2018, after meeting at the gates of the primary school their children all go to.</p>
      <p>It came after Kieran and Katie split, following his affair with their children's nanny.</p>
      <p>While they're yet to officially divorce, their post-split relationship has been marred by Katie's animosity towards Michelle.</p>

      <p>She was banned from contacting Kieran's new love and another school mum after being convicted of using threatening language or behaviour towards them outside the school.</p>
      <p>And Kieran recently branded his estranged wife a "disgrace" and hinted he would go for full custody of Jett and Bunny in the wake of Katie's wild summer of partying, which culminated in her dumping toyboy Kris Boyson for builder Charles Drury before taking Kris back once again.</p>
