      <p>A former Centrica executive is set to be announced as the new boss of the UK’s biggest water trade body as the industry gears up to fight nationalisation and a regulatory crackdown.</p>
      <p>Water UK is set to appoint Christine McGourty as its new chief executive, Sky News reported.</p>
      <p>The announcement of her appointment is expected later this week.</p>

      <p>McGourty was formerly the BBC’s science and technology correspondent and prior to that was a technology specialist at the Daily Telegraph.</p>
      <p>She has since worked in communications and public affairs for trade body Energy UK, British Gas-owner Centrica and engineering and technology business Laird.</p>
      <p>She will succeed Michael Roberts in the role who has run the organisation for the last four years.</p>
      <p>Her impending appointment coincides with a tricky time for the sector.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party has said it will nationalise the UK’s private water companies if it wins the upcoming General Election.</p>
      <p>Even if Labour does not win the election next month, the water industry is still facing a squeeze from politicians and regulators.</p>

      <p>Regulator Ofwat is due to issue its final price settlements with major water companies next month.</p>
      <p>The regulator stunned the industry in July, when it rejected all but three leading suppliers’ business plans for 2020-2025. </p>
      <p>Ofwat demanded water companies pay their debts faster, become more efficient and treat customers better. </p>
      <p>Ofwat’s stance sparked fury among water companies and led to accusations from major investors in the industry that the regulator was becoming politicised.</p>
      <p>A Water UK spokesperson said the body would announce its new chief executive this week but would not confirm who it would be.</p>
