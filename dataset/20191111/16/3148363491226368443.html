      <h1>Adam Schiff Has Yet to Release Tim Morrison Transcript | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>House Intelligence Committee chair Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) has yet to release the transcript of the closed-door testimony of former National Security Council senior director for European and Russian affairs Tim Morrison — just two days before public hearings begin.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:10:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak, Joel B. Pollak</a></address>
      <p>Morrison’s testimony is considered the most favorable to President Donald Trump, after he <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/31/former-nsc-official-not-concerned-that-anything-illegal-was-discussed-during-trump-ukraine-call/">reportedly</a> told the committee in late October: “I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.” Morrison also reportedly said that Ukraine was not aware of any hold on U.S. aid until Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/28/trump-ukraine-military-aid-russia-1689531">reported</a> it on August 28, 2019.</p>
      <p>Though Republicans also say many other statements by witnesses have been exculpatory, they have said Morrison’s was particularly so. Democrats were “sucking lemons” after Morrison’s testimony, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/10/31/gop-rep-meadows-dems-are-sucking-lemons-after-tim-morrisons-deposition/">said</a>.</p>
      <p>Republicans have asked that Morrison be called to testify in public — a request that Schiff has not yet approved. Under the House resolution rules, Schiff can block Republican witnesses, but they cannot block his. The rule are a departure from past precedent, in which each side could veto each other’s witnesses, subject to committee vote.</p>
      <p>Schiff has kept the transcripts under lock and key — even after House Democrats passed a resolution authorizing an impeachment inquiry, which provided for at least one public hearing and allowed transcripts to be released.</p>
      <p>Transcripts have been in the exclusive possession of committee Democrats and their staff, and Republicans say that they are not allowed to review transcripts except in a secure room and in the presence of a Democratic staffer.</p>
      <p>Democrats have given themselves time to pore over the transcripts — each of which runs hundreds of pages of long — and to cherry-pick the quotes they consider most favorable to their case, or most embarrassing to the president. They present these quotes as a “summary” of what was said — excluding quotes that include exculpatory evidence.</p>
      <p>The media use the Democrats’ summaries to construct their news stories before any of them — much less Republicans — have had an opportunity to digest the lengthy testimonial records. Partly as a result, the media narrative is driven by pro-impeachment arguments. Republicans say Democrats are deliberately trying to drum up public support for impeachment before Americans have seen all of the relevant evidence.</p>
