      <p>LUCKNOW: Stylish batsman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shai-Hope">Shai Hope</a> slammed an unbeaten century to steer the West Indies to a comprehensive five-wicket win over Afghanistan in the third ODI and complete a 3-0 whitewash on Monday.</p>
      <p>Chasing 250 for a win, Hope, opening the innings, smashed three sixes and eight fours in his 145-ball 109 not out to help West Indies overhauled the target, scoring 253 for 5 in 48.4 overs.</p>
      <p>He was ably supported by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Roston-Chase">Roston Chase</a> (42 not out), <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brandon-King">Brandon King</a> (39), <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/nicholas-pooran">Nicholas Pooran</a> (21) and skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/kieron-pollard">Kieron Pollard</a> (32).</p>
      <p>Earlier, put into bat, Afghanistan posted a competitive 249 for 7, riding on Asghar Afghan's 85-ball 86 and fifties from opener Hazratullah Zazai (50) and Mohammad Nabi (50 not out).</p>
      <p>Asghar and Nabi shared a 127-run partnership for the sixth wicket after Afghanistan slipped to 118 for 5 to lift the team to a good score.</p>
      <p>For the West Indies, Keemo Paul (3/44) snapped three wickets, Alzarri Joseph (2/59) took two, while Romario Shepherd (1/47) and Roston Chase (1/24) accounted for one each.</p>
      <p>West Indies were reduced to 4 for 2 early in their chase with Mujeeb striking twice in the third over.</p>
      <p>The spinner dismissed Evin Lewis (1) and Shimron Hetmyer (0) early but King and Hope added 64 runs before Rashid Khan cleaned up the latter.</p>
      <p>Pooran then joined Hope and the duo took West Indies past the 100-run mark before the former became a victim of Sharafuddin Ashraf in the 29th over.</p>
      <p>Pollard then shared 63 runs with Hope but the skipper was removed by Nabi in the 38th over.</p>
      <p>Chase and Hope then took the team home.</p>
