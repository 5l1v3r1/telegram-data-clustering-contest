      <h1>No light for shooting at 2022 Commonwealth Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:08:13+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Tushar-Dutt-479120230.cms" target="_blank">Tushar Dutt</a></address>
      <p>PUNE: Chances of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/shooting">shooting</a> making it to the 2022 Birmingham <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Commonwealth-Games">Commonwealth Games</a> (CWG) are as good as none.</p>
      <p>And this would be official when president of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Commonwealth-Games-Federation">Commonwealth Games Federation</a> (CGF) Dame Louise Martin and CEO David Grevemberg meet the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Indian-Olympic-Association">Indian Olympic Association</a> (IOA) chief Narinder Batra in New Delhi on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Shooting and IOA's threat to boycott the 2022 edition will be discussed in the meeting, along with 'other possibilities', when the officials meet.</p>
      <p>Talking about the meeting, CGF chief executive officer Grevemberg told TOI that shooting will be discussed but not for the 2022 edition.</p>
      <p>"I think we have been fairly clear of our constitution and the jurisdiction of the host country. The decision to drop shooting is their (Birmingham organising committee) recommendation and it is their decision. They have been very clear where they stand on this," Grevemberg told TOI over the phone, when asked about shooting's chances of making it to 2022.</p>
      <p>He said that possibility of shooting making it to the programme in the future editions of the Games will be discussed.</p>
      <p>"There may be some potential opportunities other than the 2022 CWG, like organising a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Commonwealth-Shooting-Championships">Commonwealth Shooting Championships</a>, which the ISSF (international shooting body) would need to help conduct. Also, this could be discussed for the 2026 Games and beyond," he said.</p>
      <p>When asked whether IOA's call to boycott the CWG is justified, the CEO said: "I am reluctant to think about the possibility of a boycott. I feel we have to respect each other's views, listen to each other and find solutions together. I don't think it is a win or lose situation for anyone. We have a constitution and not one nation or one sport is bigger than that. We must respect that."</p>
      <p>He added that the delegation is looking forward to the meetings.</p>
      <p>"We are confident and hopeful it will be an excellent visit and we are encouraged by the very positive dialogue between IOA president Dr Batra and CGF president Dame Louise Martin in arranging this trip."</p>
