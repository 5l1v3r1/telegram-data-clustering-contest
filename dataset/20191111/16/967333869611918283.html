      <p>A Qantas Airways A380 aircraft has been grounded after a door on the plane was almost torn off in a hangar following a routine maintenance check at Sydney Airport, according to the news.com.au, a media outlet.</p>
      <p>Flight QF7, from Sydney to Dallas, was grounded on Saturday and return flight QF8, which would have left Dallas on Sunday, have been cancelled because of the incident.</p>
      <p>The damaged A380 “sustained some damage inside the hangar” during maintenance, according to media reports.</p>

      <blockquote>​"We are working to minimise impacts to our customers and we apologise for any delays," a Qantas spokesperson said in a statement as quoted by the Gatton Star.</blockquote>
      <p>The damaged plane will be grounded for approximately 2 weeks.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred in the wake of Airbuses rival Boeing still reeling from problems with its 737 MAX series aircraft; the passenger jet was grounded due to the two deadly accidents.</p>
