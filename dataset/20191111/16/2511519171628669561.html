      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/whatsapp">latest update to WhatsApp</a> is draining the battery of Android phones, according to some users.</p>
      <p>Owners of OnePlus phones appear to be particularly affected by the issue, with reports appearing in forums, Google Play Store comments and across social media.</p>
      <p>Other problems with the popular messaging app also seem to have surfaced since the release of the most recent version for Android.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, since the last update I can't download nor send photos [or] videos," one user wrote in one of the most popular <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp&amp;reviewId=gp%3AAOqpTOHEzhpFzHLP4QmrfG22M3O6ty_n-rh_DxQU1wQqO6V6OpiaDBhcyDHBE8EEQjVB0ERhXadmbMaRTS6Ik0M">comments</a> on WhatsApp's Google Play Store page.</p>
      <p>"The screen keeps telling me that the media file doesn't exist on this device. Also, the battery drainage has exponentially grown. When I'm on the road I always need to bring my powerbank to ensure I'm reachable for colleagues when working."</p>
      <p>Other WhatsApp users shared screenshots of their battery usage on Twitter, complaining that the app was accounting for the majority of their battery use despite not using it much.</p>
      <p>One OnePlus 5T user wrote: "It really freaks me when I see the battery stats just to know WhatsApp is sucking the battery like anything".</p>
      <p>Despite being tagged in many of the tweets, the Facebook-owned app did not respond to affected users. <i>The Independent</i> has reached out to WhatsApp for comment.</p>
      <p>Reddit users reported similar issues with other devices, including the Google Pixel 3, Pixel 4, Huawei P20 Pro and certain models of Xiaomi smartphones.</p>
      <p>"WhatsApp has been draining the battery insanely," one user wrote. "I think I've seen 33 per cent of all battery consumption by WhatsApp on the stats."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/whatsapp-update-latest-feature-version-android-ios-security-a9180856.html">latest WhatsApp 2.19.308 update</a> introduced several new features, including biometric security that allows users to secure their private conversations and group chats with their fingerprints.</p>
      <p>Owners of iPhones and other iOS devices do not appear to be facing any problems with their battery when using WhatsApp. </p>
