      <h1>Rulani Takes Another Dig At Chiefs?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:09:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:09</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>Orlando Pirates interim head coach, Rulani Mokwena took another dig at Kaizer Chiefs after the game on Saturday. </p>
      <p>The young tactician was visibly furious after his side’s 3-2 defeat to Chiefs in the Soweto Derby at the weekend, calling out Amakhosi for ‘thuggish behaviour’ after a tackle on Fortune Makaringe and a scuffle which took place on the pitch before the full-time whistle. </p>
      <p>Mokwena didn’t hold back on his remarks during the post-match press conference either, after pointing out the incidents time and time again. </p>

      <p>Another thing, which ruffled the head coach’s feathers, was the penalty that was awarded to Amakhosi in the final minutes of the encounter, with Mokwena of the opinion that there was a dive in the box.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, the Pirates’ interim head coach sarcastically remarked how ‘swimming’ and ‘Judo’ will not be a part of his preparations in the FIFA break. </p>
      <p>“I am definitely looking forward to the FIFA break, fortunately or unfortunately, the doctors have to work on broken noses, bruised eyes, broken knee, that is the first thing and the second thing – what am I going to be working on? I am definitely not working on Taekwondo, Judo or swimming,” he said.  </p>
