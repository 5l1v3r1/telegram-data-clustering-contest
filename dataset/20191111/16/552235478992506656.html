      <h1>Brexit party in chaos as former MEP says Nigel Farage ignored Scotland</h1>
      <h2>Former MEP David Coburn said he's ditched support for the party in a row over support for the union.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:43:33+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Philip, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/andy-philip/</a></address>
      <p> Scotland’s first <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/brexit-1">Brexit</a> party politician has turned against his former allies in a brutal verdict on Nigel Farage’s leadership.</p>
      <p>David <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/humiliated-ex-ukip-mep-set-14836675">Coburn</a> said the party had ignored Scotland and the union - and threatened to campaign against them.</p>
      <p>Coburn exposed a party in meltdown over how to deliver its key commitment to leaving the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/eu-election-results-scotland-live-16206451">EU</a> .</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And he revealed a split on where to let Tories have a free run in constituencies.</p>
      <p>In an online backlash, the former MEP said: “I am sick and tired of Scotland being ignored and sidelined within the Brexit party and I no longer have to keep quiet.”</p>
      <p>He spoke out shortly before Farage revealed the Brexit Party won’t contest 317 seats won by Tories at the last election.</p>
      <p>But they will still contest Labour seats, potentially helping the SNP in Scottish marginals.</p>
      <p>Corburn urged voters to back the Labour candidate in his home patch, Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, previously held by Gordon Brown.</p>
      <p>Coburn said there is “no evidence” of a Labour-SNP pact to allow a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>Asked if he no longer supports Farage’s single-issue party, he replied: “Definitely I don’t.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Humiliated Farage caved in during a hasty press conference, claiming standing against Tories in their 317 seats would lead to a hung parliament, where no party has overall control.</p>
      <p>Farage said: "That action, our announcement today, prevents a second (EU) referendum. That right now is the most important single thing in our country.</p>
      <p>“In a sense we now have a Leave alliance. We’ve just done it unilaterally."</p>
      <p>Coburn was elected as a Ukip MEP under Farage’s leadership in 2014.</p>
      <p>He joined the Brexit Party in February but did not stand at the European election.</p>
