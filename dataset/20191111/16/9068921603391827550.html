      <h1>New AR Sensor Coming to 2020 iPad Pro and iPhone Models, AR/VR Headset as Soon as 2021</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:30:13+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Slivka</a></address>
      <p>Following a report from <i>The Information</i> this morning summarizing a recent internal Apple meeting that pegged the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/11/apple-augmented-reality-headset-2022/">release of Apple's augmented reality headsets</a> for the 2022–23 timeframe rather than the more aggressive 2020 window that has previously been rumored, <i>Bloomberg</i>'s Mark Gurman has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">shared additional information on the company's AR roadmap</a> that will initially focus on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and iPhone before the glasses come to fruition.</p>

      <p><i>"<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/">Apple Glasses</a>" concept</i> <br/>Gurman says Apple is working on "a range of augmented and virtual-reality devices" based around a new 3D sensor system, which will arrive first on a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> slated for release in the first half of next year, and followed by the 2020 iPhones later in the year.</p>
      <blockquote>A new ‌iPad Pro‌ for release as early as the first half of 2020 will feature a new module with two camera sensors, up from one on the current model, and a small hole for the 3-D system, letting people create three-dimensional reconstructions of rooms, objects and people. The Cupertino, California-based technology giant also plans to add the sensor to new high-end iPhones later in 2020, along with 5G networking capabilities, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced products.</blockquote>
      <p>Moving beyond existing devices, Apple is said to be targeting 2021 or 2022 for the release of a combination VR and AR headset focused on "gaming, watching video and virtual meetings." A lighter weight set of AR glasses could follow as soon as 2023. <br/><br/>The 3D sensor system to be used in the upcoming is said to be a more advanced version of the current Face ID sensor, and Apple's engineering teams are working on creating linkages to the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/08/apple-augmented-reality-headset-2020/">"rOS" operating system</a> for these headsets that will let them work with existing iOS devices. <br/><br/>For more on Apple's AR/VR project, check out the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">full report over at bloomberg.com</a>.</p>
