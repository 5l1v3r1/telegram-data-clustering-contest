      <h1>General election: 15,000 disadvantaged teens drop out of college and sixth form in one year</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Labour is blaming the removal of the £30-a-week Education Maintenance Allowance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:27:35+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Almost 15,000 disadvantaged teenagers dropped out of sixth form or college before finishing their course last year, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> analysis shows.</p>
      <p>Some 14,358 disadvantaged students failed to complete an A-level, applied general or tech programme in 2018.</p>
      <p>Just 87.3% of disadvantaged students aged 16 to 18 complete their course - compared to 92.5% of all students.</p>
      <p>Labour claimed the toll could be blamed on the Tories scrapping the £30-a-week Education Maintenance Allowance in 2011 and replace it with a less generous bursary scheme.</p>
      <p>Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: “These figures show the government is badly failing the most disadvantaged students, who are being denied access to education.</p>

      <p>“We warned the Tories that scrapping EMA was a mistake and nine years on students are still suffering as a result.</p>
      <p>“Labour will bring back EMA to ensure that further education is available for the many, not the few.”</p>
      <p>Labour analysed figures from the Department for Education, which has been compiling the data on disadvantaged students in its current form for two years.</p>
      <p>The 2017/18 figures were a drop compared to the year before, when 17,865 disadvantaged 16- to 18-year-olds failed to complete their course.</p>
      <p>Students are defined as disadvantaged if they were eligible for free schools meals at some point between Year 6 and Year 11.</p>
      <p>They are also disadvantaged if they were in the care system or adopted.</p>
      <p>EMA was introduced by Labour in 2004 and went to 650,000 young people on low family incomes each year by the time they were scrapped in 2011.</p>
