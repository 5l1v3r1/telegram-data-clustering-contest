      <p>While straightforward solutions are not anticipated, it is understood that Riley will tell clubs the on-field referee will make more use of the pitchside monitors from now on.</p>
      <p>Premier League officials had been expected to use them more often when VAR came into use at the start of the current season, but Riley had advised for them not to be used in order to prevent additional delays.</p>
      <p>He is thought to have changed his approach on the matter now though, and it is now felt that on-field referees are best placed to make the marginal calls as they are more aware of the flow of the game and the atmosphere at the time.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> boss Dean Smith put his support behind the idea of referees using the monitors after his side’s derby defeat by Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>Villa winger Trezeguet was tackled in the box by Wolves’ Jonny Otto and after referee Anthony Taylor waved away protests, the VAR backed up his decision.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But Smith felt the decision was wrong and Taylor could have used the tecnhology at his disposal.</p>
      <p>Asked if he felt it was a foul, he said: "I thought it was, but I haven't seen it back. It'll take something for the refs to go and check the pitch-side monitor, that's for sure."</p>
