      <p>Indians are expected to spend nearly $94 billion on IT next year, up a hefty 6.6 per cent over the 2019 sum of $88.5 billion, a report by market research firm Gartner <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/%20newsroom/press-releases/2019-%2011-11-gartner-forecasts-it-%20spending-in-india-to-total-us-%2094">said</a> late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>According to the report, while software technologies will see a maximum growth of 15.2 per cent, IT devices are expected to see the highest spending estimated at over $35 billion.</p>
      <blockquote>“2020 will be a rebound year for India’s IT spending as consumers return to purchasing mobile phones after sitting on the sidelines,” said John-David Lovelock, Research Vice President at Gartner.</blockquote>
      <p>Apart from software and devices, India will escalate its investments in data centre systems, IT and communication services.</p>
      <blockquote>“In mid-2019, the Indian government introduced corporate tax cuts, along with policies that were aimed at reviving the economy and bolstering consumer spending. As a result, corporate spending in software and services saw an uptick and organizations continued to invest in cloud, analytics, digital and automation,” said Arup Roy, Research Vice President at Gartner.</blockquote>
      <p>The report notes that consumer resistance to investing in devices in 2019 impacted overall IT spending in the country.</p>
      <p>However, earlier in October, a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910251077147934-smartphone-shipments-hit-record-high-despite-the-economic-slowdown---report/">report</a> by research firm Counterpoint said India defied the cloudy economic climate in the country with smartphone shipments hitting a new record high of 49 million units during the third quarter of 2019.</p>
      <p>Smartphone shipments grew by 10 per cent in India during the third quarter of 2019, driven by new product launches and special discounts.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Indian economy is going through a sluggish phase, with GDP growth the slowest in over six years, in the face of a sharp deceleration in consumer demand and lukewarm investments.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to transform India into a $5 trillion economy by 2025.</p>
