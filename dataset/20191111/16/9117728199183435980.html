        <b>Being a six-time World Champion <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> has his standards set very high, but even he thinks 2019 could be his best season as he looks to round out the season in style.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hamilton has won ten races this season and wrapped up the Drivers' Championship with a P2 at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a>, behind <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a>. Hamilton still has a chance to make his title victory even more impressive with the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/Brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/abu-dhabi-grand-prix">Abu Dhabi Grands Prix</a> left, races he won in 2018.</p>
      <p>Despite looking unbeatable it hasn't always been the easiest season for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a>. However, the Brit insists 2019 could be his best performing year.</p>

      <p><i>“I tried to make sure that I’ve started the season as I finished last year and I think that’s just stayed through the season,”</i> said Hamilton as quoted by <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/lewis-hamilton-champion-unfinished-masterpiece/4594710/?utm_source=RSS&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=RSS-F1&amp;utm_term=News&amp;utm_content=www">Motorsport</a>.</p>

        <i> “I’ve been very consistent in qualifying. I’ve not had particularly spectacular pole positions that perhaps I did last year, but it’s been second row the majority of the time.</i>

        <i>“Apart from Hockenheim [where Hamilton went off while in control of the rain-hit race] – but I’ll give myself a pass for that weekend because I wasn’t really 100% – I think it’s been the best performing year."</i>
