      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:59:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:59</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Regen, Kelly Ashmore, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/charlotte-regen/, https://www.facebook.com/dudleybclive/</a></address>
      <p>Two new stores will open at the former River Island unit at intu Merry Hill.</p>
      <p>Hobbs and All Good Things will be enticing shoppers to the upper mall of the Brierley Hill shopping centre before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Set to open later this month, All Good Things will target sustainably-conscious shoppers with ethical fashion labels, ‘red carpet’ dress rental, and a collection of end-of-the-line clothing from leading designer brands.</p>
      <p>Hobbs is also opening a 2,500 sq ft store in the next few weeks, offering its wide range of women’s clothing, footwear and accessories.</p>

      <p>Nick Round, regional managing director at intu, said: “All Good Things is an exciting and modern concept that demonstrates how retail continues to evolve and innovate in response to changing consumer behaviour.</p>
      <p>“Hobbs has also selected intu Merry Hill to target aspirational shoppers in the West Midlands and the addition of these fantastic brands will further strengthen the centre’s already strong retail and leisure mix to provide even more compelling experiences for its millions of visitors.”</p>
