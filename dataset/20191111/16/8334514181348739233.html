      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Foreign Office said on Monday it was concerned about the escalation of violence between protesters and police in Hong Kong and urged both sides to find a way forward.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong police shot and critically wounded a protester and a man was set on fire on Monday, marking a dramatic escalation in more than five months of often violent pro-democracy unrest in the former British territory.</p>
      <p>“Today’s events are deeply disturbing. We are seriously concerned by the ongoing violence, and the escalation between protestors and police,” a spokesman for Britain’s Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Protestors should avoid violence, and the police must not respond disproportionately. All sides need to find a way forward through dialogue.”</p>
