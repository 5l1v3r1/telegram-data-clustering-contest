      <h1>Mel B demands to speak to Tesco boss after discovering Scary Spice image on Clubcard ad</h1>
      <h2>The former Spice Girls left a furious message for CEO Dave Lewis across her social media pages</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:44:34+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Needham, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Mel B has demanded to speak to Tesco's CEO Dave Lewis after an image from her Spice Girls' heyday has been used in a Clubcard advert.</p>
      <p>"Can the CEO OF <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tescofood/">@tescofood</a> DAVE LEWIS PLEASE CONTACT ME URGENTLY. Thank you," Mel fired on both her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .accounts.</p>
      <p>As part of her post, Mel added a shot of a billboard showcasing her dressed in her iconic Scary Spice leopard print and performing on stage under the Clubcard logo.</p>
      <p>"Stop right now. You get 10% off two big shops a month for £7.99" says a speech bubble coming from Mel's mouth.</p>
      <p>"Thank you very much," reads the reply - in a nod to the band's 1997 hit.</p>

      <p>Mel has given no further response to her posts. Mirror Online has contacted Tesco for comment.</p>
      <p>Businessman Dave Lewis has been the CEO of Tesco since 2014.</p>
      <p>While Mel previously worked with Tesco in 2007. Along with her Spice Girls bandmates, Mel paid to be part of their festive campaign.</p>
      <p>The TV ad featured the band browsing the store as they shopped for each other's Christmas presents.</p>
      <p>It coincided with their first reunion tour that saw them perform in America and the UK before the tour was cut short in February 2008.</p>

      <p>"I wouldn’t call my dating experience bad, I’ve only been single for three and a half years. I’ve been married for ten years, then I was engaged for a few years before that so I’ve always been in long-term relationships.</p>
      <p>"The idea of dating scares me a little bit, but the dates that I have been on haven’t been disastrous because I’ve always either met them through a friend of a friend, or they’ve been in the celebrity circle, so I’ve always felt quite safe and it’s always been very respectful so, so far so good, but I’m still single, so I don’t even know if it is a good thing!"</p>
