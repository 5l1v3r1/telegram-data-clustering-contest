      <h2>Fears raised that a plans to cut £187,000 from the budget could lead to 12 jobs being lost</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T16:39:22+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author">Jenny Foulds, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jenny-foulds/</a></address>
      <p>Fears have been raised that at least 12 jobs will be axed in a bid to slash spending at community centres across West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>Council chiefs are proposing to cut £187,000 a year, which if agreed, would see a review of opening hours, charges and handing keys to regular groups using the halls.</p>
      <p>The detail is revealed in a report, which will go before councillors at a corporate services committee meeting tomorrow (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>It follows two public consultations after a budget decision was made last year to cut spending from halls across the area.</p>
      <p>The paper states there is an “overprovision” of West Dunbartonshire Leisure Trust (WDLT) staff, who work across the community facilities service.</p>
      <p>West Dunbartonshire Council say the move will ensure all 13 community centres stay open.</p>
      <p>However, opposition councillors have hit out at the plan.</p>
      <p>Councillor David McBride said: “I am very concerned regarding the latest round of SNP cuts to be decided at this week’s corporate services committee.</p>
      <p>“Not content with the services cuts they have imposed on us in recent years and one of the highest charges in Scotland for vital community alarms for the elderly, now even more cuts to jobs and services are being proposed by the SNP administration.</p>
      <p>“This time the savings will hit front line customer service staff and facilities assistants reducing the services with leisure centres.</p>
      <p>“Once again our SNP councillors are attacking low paid staff which see a minimum of 12 jobs will be lost as staff have to take on additional duties to make savings in excess of £300,000.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Jim Bollan said: “More cuts in jobs and services coming from the SNP Council with their latest attacks on the library and leisure services across West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>“Over £300,000 to be cut from these services with a minimum of 12 jobs to be cut along with more zero hour contracts and seasonal contracts to be introduced.</p>
      <p>“Many of our services require to be subsidised Libraries and Leisure are only two of them and these should continue to be supported from the council tax.”</p>
      <p>Officers have come up with three options to save the cash, with the other two suggestions recommending Bowling and Bonhill community centres are closed, as well as two in Clydebank.</p>
      <p>The third option, which chiefs are recommending is approves, would keep all of the centres open.</p>
      <p>The council employs 22 full-time equivalent facilities assistants, nine full-time equivalent pavilion assistants and 4.3 full-time equivalent (FTE) general operatives.</p>
      <p>The report states: “Given the low levels of occupancy, WDLT management has agreed with the council assessment that this 35.3 FTE represents an over provision of staffing and that there is scope to undertake a review to deliver a more efficient service.</p>
      <p>“The review would include streamlining working practices to create a more flexible and efficient staffing model.</p>
      <p>“Opening hours of centres will also be reviewed with consideration given to bespoke solutions for some centres including community keyholders.</p>
      <p>“Flexible workforce options such as term time and seasonal contracts, annualised hours and peripatetic working will be considered to ensure maximum efficiency of the staffing resource.”</p>
      <p>Council leader Jonathan McColl responded by saying that he was “delighted” that no centre would have to close. He said: “As the political leadership of the council, the SNP set officers the challenge of delivering the aspirations of the public, using better management of resources rather than simply removing facilities from our communities.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted that we will be able to make the required savings without closing any of our community centres.”</p>
