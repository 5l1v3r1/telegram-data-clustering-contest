      <h3>Today’s the day to get a $750 MacBook Air</h3>
      <p>Today only, Amazon has <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/11/macbook-air/">Apple’s MacBook Air 128GB (late 2018 renewed) in silver, space gray, or gold for <b>$750</b></a>. That’s $350 off the original price and $250 off the $1,000 going rate on this redesigned MacBook Air that debuted a year ago. Step up to the 256GB model for <b>$870</b>.</p>
      <p>MacBook Air from Apple sports a 13-inch Retina display, Touch ID, a dual-core 8th generation Intel i5 processor and 128GB of storage. Two Thunderbolt 3 ports and up to 12 hours of battery life round out the list of notable features. Includes a 90-day warranty.</p>
      <h3>Apple’s previous-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro with Cell</h3>
      <p>Target offers <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/11/apple-ipad-pro-target/">Apple’s previous-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro Wi-Fi + Cellular 64GB in space gray for <b>$480</b></a>. Originally $779, we’ve seen it fall to as low as $550 at Amazon. Notable features include a 10.5-inch Retina display, A10X Fusion chip, Touch ID, and more. This is a great tablet for on-the-go workflows and it <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/03/apple-announces-brand-new-ipados-redesigned-home-screen-multi-window-apps-richer-multitasking-more/">does support iPadOS</a>, which is now <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/24/ipados-now-available/">available</a>. Apple’s previous-generation iPad Pro is great for users that do not require the latest tech, but still want to be in Apple’s ecosystem.</p>

      <h3>iPhone SE delivers a beloved form-factor for $60</h3>
      <p>Best Buy offers <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/11/iphone-se-best-buy/">Apple’s iPhone SE in Silver with 32GB of storage for <b>$60</b></a>. This model is locked to Simple Mobile’s pre-paid service for a year. As a comparison, Apple currently <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MP7W2LL/A/iphone-se-32gb-rose-gold-unlocked">charges</a> $349 in new condition and this is $25 less than our previous mention. iPhone SE has developed a bit of a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/04/01/iphone-se-diary-day-1-first-impressions/">cult following</a> in recent years with its smaller form-factor and affordable price. Ideal for kids or grandparents, this model sports a four-inch display, 12MP camera, Touch ID and more.<i> </i>Ships with a 90-day warranty for added peace of mind. iPhone SE is iOS 13 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/19/iphone-ipad-ios-13-compatibility/">eligible</a> and is expected to receive additional updates for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <h3>NETGEAR’s 802.11ac router bundle is $95</h3>
      <p>Walmart is currently offering the<a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/11/netgear-802-11ac-wi-fi-router-r6120-bundle/"> NETGEAR 802.11ac Wi-Fi Router (R6120) bundled with the NETGEAR 802.11ac Range Extender for <b>$95</b></a>. Typically purchasing both separately would run you closer to $120, with today’s offer saving you just over 20%. This is also the best value we’ve tracked to date. Featuring up to 1,200Mb/s of network throughput across its dual-band connections, this router and range extender combo provides enough coverage to fill most homes with 802.11ac Wi-Fi. Having both devices in your setup is perfect for multistory houses or setups where just a centralized router won’t provide ample coverage.</p>
