      <h1>Sembcorp buys remaining 30% stake in gas unit from Temasek's Seletar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:21:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Fiona Lam</a></address>
      <p>SEMBCORP Industries (SCI) on Monday announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Sembcorp Utilities (SCU) has completed the acquisition of the remaining 30 per cent interest in Sembcorp Gas for S$12.1 million.</p>
      <p>SCU bought the stake from Seletar Investments, which is wholly-owned by Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings. Temasek is also a major shareholder of SCI, with a 49.5 per cent interest as at the end of 2018.</p>
      <p>With the transaction, the Sembcorp Gas, which imports and retails natural gas, is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCU.</p>
      <p>The S$12.1 million consideration was based on discounted cash flows to determine fair market value.</p>
      <p>The deal strengthens SCI’s position as a provider of integrated energy solutions and a major gas player in Singapore, the group said on Monday.</p>

      <p>The transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the earnings per share and net asset value per share of SCI for fiscal 2019 ending Dec 31.</p>
      <p>Shares of SCI were trading up three cents or 1.3 per cent at S$2.30 as at 1.13pm on Monday, after the announcement was made.</p>
