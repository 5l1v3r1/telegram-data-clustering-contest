      <p>The shooting of a protester in Hong Kong has marked an escalation in the violence that has rocked the city for weeks, as pro-democracy activists clashed once again with police, this time in broad daylight.</p>
      <p>In one incident, footage from social media shows a police officer drawing his gun, and firing at a masked protester who was advancing towards him. He is in a critical condition in hospital.</p>
      <p>More than 60 people were wounded in the violence on Monday, which the territory's chief executive Carrie Lam addressed in a televised appearance.</p>

      <p>“The violence has far exceeded the call for democracy and the demonstrators are now the people’s enemy,” she declared.</p>
      <p>“If there’s still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong ... government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I’m making this statement clear and loud here: that will not happen.”</p>
      <p>Protesters threw petrol bombs at police after a weekend of clashes across the Chinese-ruled territory, marking a dramatic escalation in more than five months of often violent pro-democracy unrest.</p>
