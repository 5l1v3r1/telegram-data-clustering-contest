      <p>"I also will be launching my book and artwork to stop the young generation getting caught up in crime and instead focus on their pathways.</p>
      <p>"I really believe it’s my must to bring back to the community, world. I’m so so sorry. Rest in peace."</p>
      <p>Koh's boasts have been slammed by supermodel Leomie Anderson, who had previously dated Harry.</p>
      <p>Victoria's Secret model and fashion designer, Leomie, wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : The boy who murdered my ex and close friend Harry Uzoka should NOT be given air time. <a href="https://twitter.com/ITV">@ITV</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RossKemp">@RossKemp</a> what the hell is this s***???</p>

      <p>"Have you no respect for his family?? Please retweet to have this stopped, his family have suffered enough.</p>
      <p>Sorry but he hasn’t even been in jail 2 years yet he’s allowed to paint himself as reformed???</p>
      <p>"He killed him out of pure obsession and jealousy so him even speaking on the situation makes no sense to me as it’s not a path many can even relate to."</p>
      <p>Cheyenne Joseph replied: “Book a visit to see me” like if he’s some celeb doing meet and greet. This is making me SICK."</p>
      <p>Actor Monel Bailey added: "This is terrible. They need to have some decency and compassion for him and everyone that’s been affected.</p>
      <p>"It’s not fair on the family and friends that new him just for to create a story line . <a href="https://twitter.com/ITV">@ITV</a> have some respect!"</p>
      <p>Kiss FM presenter Tinea Taylor blasted: "W** is this s***! Disgusting."</p>

      <p>Tragic Harry Uzoka, 25, died at the scene  in Old Oak Road, Shepherd's Bush, London, at around 3.55pm on January 11, following the violent stabbing.</p>
      <p>He had previously been described as 'Britain's most famous black model' and modelled for GQ and Zara.</p>
      <p>But after Koh, who worked for Louis Vuitton, bragged he had slept with Harry's girlfriend, model Ruby Campbell, Harry said he wanted to settle the row "face to face".</p>

      <p>The pair then arranged to meet in Shepherd's Bush, West London, on the afternoon of January 11.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC, said Koh and pals Jonathan Okigbo and Merse Dikanda, both 24, were armed with at least two knives and a "particularly large" machete-style blade.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the court heard  that Koh said "are you mad?", produced two knives and stabbed Harry in the heart.</p>

      <p>Following the trio's sentencing, grieving mum Josephine Jackson said her son's death had left a "gaping hole."</p>
      <p>In an written statement read to the court, Miss Jackson said: "I have so much pain for the death of my Harry and I find it difficult these days to go on without him.</p>
      <p>"His departure has left a gaping hole, a gap, a void in the family that we are all finding hard to contend with.</p>
      <p>"He was due to start acting in a couple of upcoming movies but that chance has been take away from him.</p>

      <p>"My son was a beautiful boy. I would give anything to change places with Harry, to take away the horror and pain that he suffered that day.</p>
      <p>"Harry, your short life enriched the lives of many, you inspired so many people and touched them with your love.</p>
      <p>"You will never be forgotten my wonderful boy."</p>
