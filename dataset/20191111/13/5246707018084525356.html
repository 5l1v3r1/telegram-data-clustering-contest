      <p>London's pop-up Pokémon Center has introduced a new Pikachu plush for visitors to buy as other products begin to completely disappear from shelves.</p>
      <p>The Pokémon Company has revealed that, starting today, the London Guard Pikachu plush will be available in limited quantities. There is a limit of one London Guard Pikachu plush per visitor, and daily quantities will also be limited, presumably ensuring that stock lasts until the store's closure at the end of the week.</p>
      <p>While not exclusive to the pop-up store, the London Guard plush appears to have been stocked in a bid to cope with the number of visitors still arriving each day. The London City Pikachu plush sold out completely yesterday due to what the store has called "phenomenal demand", and the Grookey, Scorbunny and Sobble Varsity Hoodies also sold out at the same time.</p>
      <p>The store has been <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/pokemon_center_london_goes_from_bad_to_worse_products_could_sell_out_before_closure">struggling to cope with demand</a> ever since it opened last month, with an increasing number of Pokémon fans asking for a permanent solution in the future. We've said it before and we'll say it again: the UK could <i>absolutely</i> benefit from a full-time Nintendo/Pokémon store.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's hoping it'll happen sometime soon.</i>
