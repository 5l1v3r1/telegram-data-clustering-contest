      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> congressman Peter King will not seek re-election in 2020.</p>
      <p>At least 20 House Republicans have now announced they will not seek re-election, as the party faces strong electoral headwinds under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>. Three other GOP lawmakers have resigned.</p>
      <p>King, 75 and elected for 14 terms since 1993, said in a Facebook post he wanted “flexibility to spend more time” with his children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>“The prime reason for my decision was that after 28 years of spending four days a week in Washington DC, it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>It was generally noted that his win in the 2018 midterms was his narrowest of all, with 53% of the vote.</p>
      <p>King represents parts of Long Island and is the longest-serving Republican member of New York’s congressional delegation.</p>
      <p>He has cultivated a reputation for bipartisanship while maintaining a hard line on immigration and crime, winning issues in a district which covers suburban Long Island about an hour’s drive east of Manhattan.</p>
      <p>He is also a former chair of the House homeland security committee and a leading voice on terrorism and its threat to the US.</p>
      <p>King is a proud Irish American. But in the words of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/us/politics/09king.html?_r=1&amp;hp">the New York Times in 2011</a>, when the congressman was holding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/10/peter-king-muslim-hearings-ira-supporter">hearings on the radicalisation of American Muslims</a>: “Long before [King] became an outspoken voice in Congress about the threat from terrorism, he was a fervent supporter of a terrorist group, the Irish Republican Army.”</p>
      <p>In the 1980s, King was closely linked to the nationalist fundraising group Noraid and famously proclaimed: “If civilians are killed in an attack on a military installation it is certainly regrettable, but I will not morally blame the IRA for it.”</p>
      <p>In 2011, King likened the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ira">IRA</a> to the African National Congress and the Irgun.</p>
      <p>“I understand why people who are misinformed might see a parallel,” he said. “The fact is, the IRA never attacked the United States. And my loyalty is to the United States.”</p>
      <p>The troubles in Northern Ireland, he said, were “a dirty war on both sides”. But in the 1990s, he played a key role in talks which led to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/king-of-the-hill-changes-his-tune-1.576913">peace in Northern Ireland under the Good Friday agreement</a>, acting as a go-between for Bill Clinton and the Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams.</p>
      <p>In 2009, it was reported that Barack Obama offered King the chance to be US ambassador to Ireland but the congressman declined.</p>
