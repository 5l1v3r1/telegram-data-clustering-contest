      <h1>2020 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon Gets Minor Price Bump</h1>
      <h2>It’s the only trim seeing an increase.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:42:48+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p>Customers hoping to drive away in a new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jeep/gladiator/">2020 Jeep Gladiator</a> may have to pay a bit more. A new report from <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/the-most-expensive-jeep-gladiator-is-getting-a-price-increase"><i>Cars Direct</i></a>, citing “a recent dealer order guide,” says the truck will be a bit more expensive than before – $330 more to be exact. Starting this month, the Gladiator will start at $45,370, including the $1,495 destination charge. Previously, it cost $45,040. In the realm of price increases, the Gladiator’s $330 price bump is negligible, especially for a $45,000 truck.</p>
      <p>The Gladiator arrived earlier this year with a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/316029/2020-jeep-gladiator-pricing/">starting price of $35,040</a> for the entry-level trim. But customers had been eagerly waiting for the off-road-oriented pickup. In May 2019, customers paid, on average, <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/355267/average-jeep-gladiator-price-high/">about $56,000</a> for the Gladiator – $10k more than the Rubicon’s starting price. Even some dealerships tried to capitalize on the Gladiator’s popularity by <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/356013/jeep-gladiator-dealer-markups/">adding as much as $20,000 to the truck’s MSRP</a>. By August, the Gladiator had passed the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jeep/wrangler/">Wrangler</a> in accessory sales with <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/367030/gladiator-overtakes-wrangler-accessory-sales/">Gladiator buyers spending about $200 more</a> than Wrangler customers – $1,000 and $800, respectively.</p>

      <p>The extra $330 potential buyers will now have to pay doesn’t translate into more standard features. The truck comes with the same 3.6-liter V6 paired to a six-speed manual gearbox. The eight-speed automatic remains an option, which, when equipped, brings the 2020 model’s starting price to $47,040. However, it’s the Dana 44 front and rear axles, Fox shocks, and other off-road goodies that excite Gladiator buyers.</p>
      <p>The Gladiator, when equipped with the automatic, nears the redesigned 2020 Toyota Tacoma TRD Pro in price that starts at $47,785 when also equipped with the automatic. It’s more expensive than the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/colorado/">2020 Chevy Colorado ZR2</a> and the luxury-oriented <a href="https://www.motor1.com/gmc/canyon/">2020 GMC Canyon Denali</a>, which starts at $44,095 and $45,095, respectively. However, it's unlikely the small price increase will scare away customers.</p>
