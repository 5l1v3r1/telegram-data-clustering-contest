      <h1>Spanish elections: Citizens' Party leader Albert Rivera resigns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:03:37+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera resigned following his party's poor result in the Spanish elections on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In the April 2019 elections, the party came third, receiving 4.1 million votes and 57 seats but on Sunday, the party won just 10 seats in Spain's 350-seat congress.</p>
      <p>Rivera broke into Catalan politics when he was 26-years-old. His party Ciudadanos or the Citizens party was created as a centre-right, anti-nationalist party.</p>
      <p>"We have lost almost half of the votes," Rivera said on Sunday after learning of the unexpected result.</p>
      <p>It was instead the far-right Vox party who had a victory, becoming the third most popular party and winning 52 seats.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's party received the most votes but fell short of gaining a majority in congress.</p>
      <p>Many political observers expect the country's political stalemate to continue.</p>
