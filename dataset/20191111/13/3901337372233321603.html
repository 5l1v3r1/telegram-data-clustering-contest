      <p>On Sunday night, Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Taison was reportedly subjected to racist abuse in his team's home encounter against Dynamo Kiev.</p>
      <p>The midfielder, who was clearly triggered by chants from a certain section of the crowd, stuck his middle finger up before taking aim at them with a ball. Taison and his teammate Dentinho, who was also targeted, left the field in tears, while several Kiev players tried to console them.</p>

      <p>The match was suspended in the 77th minute as a result of the incident, with the players leaving the field.</p>
      <p>Taison, however, was given his marching orders as soon as play resumed, which reduced the left-winger to tears.</p>

      <p>Shakhtar boss Luis Castro addressed the issue in a statement after the game.</p>
      <p>"My players have once again shown their character," he said, according to <i>Sky News.</i></p>
      <p>"At this moment, I want to support absolutely everyone suffering from racism and the guys who have suffered today.</p>
      <p>"Any manifestations of racism are absolutely unacceptable. It was, is, and will be a disgrace to everyone. Together, we must fight it – every day, every minute, and every second."</p>
