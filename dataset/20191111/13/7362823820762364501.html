      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/sarah-hyland">Sarah Hyland</a> and fiancé <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sarah-hyland-wells-adams-anniversary-posts">Wells Adams</a> are receiving backlash over a photo the "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/modern-family">Modern Family"</a> actress posted on Instagram.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Hyland and Adams are depicted in a photo booth along with several friends. The photo sparked controversy as Adams and friend Matt Shively are seen grabbing their respective plus ones’ breasts.</p>
      <p>Hyland playfully captioned the photo, “We take wedding photo booths very seriously... #mcm to the men who love and treat their ladies like queens 👸🏻 💕.“</p>

      <p>The acts depicted in the photo drew a polarized response from Hyland’s 6.9 million followers.</p>
      <p>“Like queens = like objects? The dissolution of patriarchal gender relations can't come soon enough,” one user wrote.</p>
      <p>“In times of gender balance and women's rights and respect, we still see pics like this... we are not moving forward with such mentalities,” another user lamented.</p>
      <p>“This just sends the wrong message,” one user simply noted.</p>

      <p>Other fans were quick to jump to the defense of the “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/modern-family">Modern Family</a>” actress.</p>
      <p>“You all realize this is her fiancé right? there’s an extremely large difference between your fiancé grabbing your boob for a photobooth pic in a lighthearted and CONSENSUAL way - and a man treating a woman like “an object”, one user passionately noted.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Another user also noted the topic of consent and said, “People are getting so overly sensitive when this is literally just a photo of people having a good a-- time WITH THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHERS WHERE THERE WAS CONSENT.”</p>
      <p>One user criticized comparisons to the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/metoo-has-morphed-into-a-career-destroying-angry-mob">#MeToo movement</a>, stating, "Hmm if she's the one posting the pic and marrying that man this photo has no comparison to the #MeToo campaign.</p>
