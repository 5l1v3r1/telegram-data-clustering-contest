      <p>"This is as a result of flooding. It will be closed for an unknown period of time. We have reached out to the Department of Transport's engineers to assess the damage so far. I don't think the road will be opened today."</p>
      <p>He said alternate routes were the M41, N2 and the R102.</p>
      <p>Many other parts of the city - including Verulam, Amanzimtoti, Chatsworth and other low lying areas - were affected by the rains.</p>
