      <p>Amazon wants to make sure that you are prepared to cook Thanksgiving dinner this year, and have discounted a number of Hamilton Beach Thanksgiving Dinner Tools in its Gold Box Deal of the Day today. You'll be able to save up to 30-percent. This includes an electric can-opener, an electric carving knife and an electric mixer.</p>
      <p>Today, you can save big on a refurbished 2019 Macbook Air. Amazon is discounting refurbished (or "renewed") models by as much as 28-percent. So you can get one for under $750. This is a great time to pick up a Macbook Air, especially if you've been eyeing them. As you won't see them much cheaper than this, and they still come with a warranty.</p>
      <p>Some Samsung TVs are currently at their lowest prices of the year on Amazon. These are not QLED TVs, but rather LED TVs, that are still at some incredible prices. And if you think that these prices will be lower on Black Friday, you're wrong. TVs are always discounted more before Black Friday than on Black Friday. It's usually the already cheap, and not that great, TVs that are discounted heavily on Black Friday – in doorbuster deals.</p>

      <p>Amazon is discounting a number of Nikon cameras and lenses right now, in its "Happy HoliDeals" event. Allowing you to save big on some great cameras on lenses. Including the Nikon D750 which is up to 15-percent off right now. There are some really good lenses on sale, like the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens, that is just $176 today – that's the same price as a used one!</p>
      <p>These deals are all available until midnight PST on the expiration date specified below. These prices are also as up-to-date as possible, but beware that prices will fluctuate throughout the day.
