      <h1>2020 Jaguar XE sedan to be launched in India on December 4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:31:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author">Aditya Jadhav  </a></address>
      <p>The 2020 <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/jaguar/xe-m469/">Jaguar XE</a> broke cover earlier this year and now the manufacturer is all set to launch the sedan in India on December 4, 2019. For its midlife update, the 2020 XE gets cosmetic tweaks and updated interiors.</p>
      <p>Cosmetic changes include an aggressively styled fascia with all-LED headlamp units. The new car sits on a set of newly designed 18-inch alloy wheels but the company is likely to continue offering the 17-inch wheel size as well in India.</p>

      <p>The interiors are updated and the 10-inch infotainment system in the current car has been replaced for a larger 12.3-inch infotainment system. The cabin also features first in segment ClearSight rear-view mirror. Jaguar has done away with the gear selector dial and now offers a stick for the same. The artificial intelligence of the new Jaguar XE learns the preferences of individual drivers and adjusts seat, mirrors, audio and climate settings automatically.</p>

      <p>The engines on offer will be the petrol and diesel units from the Ingenium series. Internationally, the XE is available in a rear-wheel drive and an all-wheel drive drivetrain layout but the latter one is unlikely to be offered in the Indian market.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Jaguar XE is sold with two engine options - 2.0-litre petrol engine producing 200PS between 4,500-6,000rpm and 320Nm of torque between 1,200-4,500rpm. The top-spec Portfolio has a higher output of 250PS at 5,500rpm and 365Nm between 1,200-4,500rpm.</p>

      <p>The 2.0-litre diesel engine has a power rating of 180PS at 4,000rpm and 430Nm of torque between 1,750-2,500rpm. Both the engines come mated to an 8-speed automatic gearbox. The company could continue to offer the same drivetrain, however, with BSVI compliant state of tune.</p>

      <p>The 2020 Jaguar XE could ask a premium of Rs 2-3 lakh over the current car's pricing and could retail between Rs 43-49 lakh, ex-showroom. The XE will continue its rivalry in the segment with the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/audi/a4-m10/">Audi A4</a>, <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mercedes-benz/c-class-m108/">Mercedes-Benz C-Class</a> and the recently launched BMW 3 series.</p>
