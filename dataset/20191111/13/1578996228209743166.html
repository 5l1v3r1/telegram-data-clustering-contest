      <h1>How Cody Simpson Is Helping Miley Cyrus Heal During Her Weeks of Silence Post-Surgery</h1>

      <p>Miley Cyrus recently underwent vocal chord surgery, <i><a href="https://people.com/music/miley-cyrus-recovering-vocal-cord-surgery-cody-simpson-by-her-side-source/">People</a> </i>reported this weekend, and the singer will have to rest her voice for "several weeks" while she heals. But the singer's devoted new boyfriend Cody Simpson is helping take care of her during her mandatory vocal rest, a source informed the outlet.</p>
      <p>“Cody is by her side. They are still doing well,” the outlet's source said. “Miley seems very happy. Cody will make sure she isn't bored while she recovers.”</p>
      <p>Cyrus needs to stay silent because of how sensitive the recovery period is, a source explained. “The surgery went well and she is resting up at home now. [She] has known for a while that she needed the surgery," the source started, pointing out that Cyrus will be resting “her voice for several weeks while her vocal cords heal. Any strain will prolong the healing.”</p>
      <p>Simpson <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29546570/cody-simpson-miley-cyrus-ex-diss/">spoke confidently</a> about what a romantic, tender boyfriend he is to Cyrus during an interview last month with the <i><a href="https://www.kiis1065.com.au/entertainment/cody-simpson-tells-all-about-his-relationship-with-miley-cyrus/">Kyle &amp; Jackie O Show</a></i>. "I’m very, very, very romantic," he told the hosts. "I don’t think she...she’d talked about how she hadn’t had that kind of an experience in a relationship before."</p>
      <p>He also added that while they had been friends for years, there was always a romantic spark there. "I think we were interested in each other ever since we first met, even when I was like, 18, and it was just not the right time," he started. "We've just been close ever since we met and—it's weird, it's like the first time I've been with someone where it wasn't necessarily an immediate romance. It was just friendship and fun and...it just developed over like five years."</p>
