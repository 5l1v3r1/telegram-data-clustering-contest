      <h1>Apple Card faces investigation after allegations of gender discrimination</h1>

      <p>New York state regulators are investigating the algorithm used by Apple Card to determine the creditworthiness of applicants after the credit card was accused of being biased against women.</p>
      <p>David Heinemeier Hansson, a prominent software developer, called the Apple Card a “f---ing sexist program” after his wife was denied an increase in her credit limit. Hansson said his wife, Jamie Hansson, had a better credit score than him and other factors in her favor that should have allowed her a limit increase.</p>
      <p>“My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple’s black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work,” he tweeted Thursday.</p>
      <p>Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, said he was given a credit line 10 times that of his wife, despite the couple sharing bank and credit card accounts.</p>

      <p>The card, launched as a partnership between Apple and Goldman Sachs in August, is now under scrutiny by the New York Department of Financial Services.</p>
      <p>An official said the department would investigate whether the algorithm used to determine credit limits violates state laws. <br/>“Financial services companies are responsible for ensuring the algorithms they use do not even unintentionally discriminate against protected groups,” superintendent Linda Lacewell said.</p>

      <p>Hansson said his wife got a “VIP bump” to match his credit limit a day after he complained about the matter. He urged regulators to contact the women who had shared similar experiences with him on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“My thread is full of accounts from women who’ve been declared to be worse credit risks than their husbands, despite higher credit scores or incomes,” he said.</p>
