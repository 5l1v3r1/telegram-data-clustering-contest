      <h1>You Can Save £114 on Lego's Fancy Technic Bugatti Chiron Right Now</h1>

      <p>Lots of Lego sets can be quite expensive, especially the big ones, so when you get chance to save yourself a big chunk of money you should jump at the chance to get in there. And right now you can <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/42083-Technic-Exclusive-Collectible-Advanced/dp/B0792RB3B6/ref=sr_1_17?keywords=lego&amp;qid=1573475794&amp;sr=8-17">save £114 on the giant Bugatti Chiron</a>, which is just over a third of the total price.</p>
      <p>Normally picking this up would cost you £330, which is a lot to spend on a Lego set, but with Amazon's discount you can get it for £216. That's still a lot of money to spend on one thing, but it's a much more enticing purchase at that price.</p>
      <p>The set itself is a 1:8 scale version of the real car, complete with an eight-speed gearbox and and movable paddle gearshift that can actually move. It's also incredibly detailed, with actual brake discs, a working steering wheel, a replica cockpit, and so much more.</p>
      <p>Of course if that's not the Technic car for you, Amazon also has a limited time deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/LEGO-42110-Toy-Multicolour/dp/B07P2GQDQ6/ref=sxbs_sxwds-stvp?keywords=lego&amp;pd_rd_i=B07P2GQDQ6&amp;pd_rd_r=0145dca8-b869-4aa6-b8e2-a931cedce1ef&amp;pd_rd_w=wmqro&amp;pd_rd_wg=99xZP&amp;pf_rd_p=7dc56c0d-8a5f-4d97-9143-7233b106859a&amp;pf_rd_r=QNQMKDN6ZSZTMDE65RVP&amp;qid=1573475794&amp;smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE">new Land Rover Defender</a>, which is £128 instead of £160 - saving you £32 off the RRP. It's not such a hiue discount, but it's still better than full price.</p>
      <p>There's no time limit on the Bugatti deal, so it's not clear how long it will be valid for. So if it takes your fancy you should pick it up as soon as you can.</p>
