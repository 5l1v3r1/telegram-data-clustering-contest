      <h1>Bajaj Chetak EV to be showcased in Pune on November 14, 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:59:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">Akbar Merchant</a></address>
      <p>Market launch for the Chetak EV is expected to take place in the coming months.</p>
      <p>Bajaj Auto recently revealed its first EV, the Chetak e-scooter. The company also announced a 3,000km-long Chetak Electric Yatra where a group of 20 riders would take the Chetak EV across India visiting multiple cities and finally end the ride in Pune on November 14, 2019 where the Chetak EV will be unveiled for the first time in that city.</p>
      <p>The Chetak EV gets European styling and is powered by an electric motor good for an output of 4kW. The e-scooter will initially be sold in cities like Pune and Bengaluru and will retail via KTM dealerships in order to ensure premium positioning and customer experience. It is yet not clear whether the standard Bajaj dealerships will be upgraded to accommodate Chetak sales in the future or whether the e-scooter will be introduced via KTM outlets in other markets too.</p>
      <p>When the Chetak e-scooter hits showrooms in the coming months, we expect on-road price of the Chetak e-scooter to be priced under Rs 1.4 lakh.</p>
