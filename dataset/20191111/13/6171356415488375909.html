      <h1>There's a second, more objective reason for the lack of 4K 60fps video on the Pixel 4 (and Google could fix it)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:00:45+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>A month ago, Google explained <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/20/google-explains-why-it-doesnt-support-4k-video-recording-at-60fps/">why it doesn't support 4K video recording at 60fps</a> on its latest flagships (or any of its phones, for that matter): It said the majority of users stick with 1080p, so it'd rather focus on improving that mode and avoid large storage consumption by 4K 60fps videos. As it turns out now, there might be another reason related to the Pixel 4's Snapdragon 855 processor, which always pulls images from the two rear cameras at once.</p>
      <p>Mishaal Rahman and his team at XDA Developers managed to unlock the 4K 60fps mode in Google Camera on a rooted Pixel 4. They quickly noticed that recorded videos never exceeded 38fps though, which isn't ideal.</p>

      <p>The team found out that the Pixel connects to both rear-facing cameras at once, which allows you to switch between the two seamlessly while zooming. It'sÂ also the reason why the Snapdragon 855 can't handle recording 60fps in 4K: It doesn't have enough bandwidth in its image sensor processor to maintain the high frame rate on two lenses at once.</p>

      <p>The solution seems simple enough: To enable 4K 60fps recordings, Google could simply disable pulling from both cameras at once. This would break optical zoom but could enable a feature that'd make <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/06/google-is-trying-to-build-phones-for-80-of-users-and-its-leading-to-stupid-mistakes/">20 percent of users</a> much happier.</p>
