        <b> Linux distribution wants to take users on a journey to an “aesthetic and immersive” Linux environment — but does it succeed?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, first things first: I’m not much of a distro hopper these days. I’m old and don’t like the hassle of reinstalling.</p>
      <p>But I <i>do</i> like to keep an eye on what’s happening out there, in the wider Linux community, especially around Linux distros based on Ubuntu.</p>
      <p>This year I’ve spotlighted <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/install-regolith-linux-i3-gaps-ubuntu">Regolith Linux</a>, <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/enso-is-a-quirky-linux-distro-mixing-ubuntu-18-04-lts-xfce-and-elementaryos">Enso</a>, <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/05/peppermint-os-10-download">Peppermint OS 10</a>, and <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/zorin-os-15-linux">Zorin OS 15</a> (among others), all based and built on a solid Ubuntu foundation.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week a reader (thanks Ricardo) suggested I take a look at Voyager Live, specifically the LTS release.</p>
      <p>So what’s it like?</p>
      <h3>Voyager Live 18.04 LTS</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://149366088.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/d%E2%80%99%C3%A9cran_2018-02-25_17-27-42-750x424.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Developed in France, the Voyager Linux distribution is available to sample in several different flavours, including a GNOME Shell based variant.</p>
      <p>The version I’m looking at is <a href="https://voyagerlive.org/voyager-18-04-lts/">Voyager 18.04 LTS</a>, a version based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and using the Xfce 4.12 (not the most recent <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/08/xfce-4-14">Xfce 4.14 release</a>) desktop environment by default.</p>
      <p>From the off you know that you’re using something <i>different</i> with Voyager. The default desktop ‘experience’ weaves together Conky, Plank and Xfce.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Voyager’s heavy use of Conky delivers a raft of on-desktop information and effects by default, including a system resource monitor, network speed display, clock with date, and even a live animated sound equaliser.</p>
      <p>Two quick panels are affixed to the left and the right of the screen. These offer shortcuts to a swathe of apps, tools, and settings, including the aforementioned Conky configs, but also Kodi (the media centre), a system info tool (CLI based), and a calendar app.</p>

      <p>Don’t Miss <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/06/install-regolith-linux-i3-gaps-ubuntu">Regolith is the i3 Ubuntu Spin You’ve Been Waiting For</a></p>
      <p>The “cog” icon in the palette on the right opens a prompt from which you can quickly access the preferences section of the various desktop components like Plank and Conky.</p>
      <p>So you can also change the appearance and layout of the Voyager desktop to suit your tastes, with many different themes and layouts supplied.</p>
      <p>Voyager — which is sometimes called Voyager Live; the particular parlance varies — is stocked with a varied selection of apps by default, including the Kupfer <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/08/best-app-launcher-for-ubuntu-linux">app launcher</a>, Xfdashboard (a GNOME Shell style workspace switcher), the CLI music app <code>moc</code>, and the Smtube YouTube MPV video player.</p>
      <p>Regardless of name, Voyager Linux offers up a unique experience set part way off the well-trodden track that the mainstream Linux distros tread.</p>
      <p>As a destination, Voyager won’t suit everyone, but for those in the mood to try something a bit different, with the assurances that an Ubuntu based distro offers, it’s well worth exploring.</p>
