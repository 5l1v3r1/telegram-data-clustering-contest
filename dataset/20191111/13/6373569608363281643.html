      <h1>Brexit Party won't stand in 317 seats at the General Election</h1>
      <h2>Nigel Farage feared if they had run it would have led to a hung parliament</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:28:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Nigel Farage has abandoned plans for the Brexit Party to contest more than 600 candidates in the General Election.</p>
      <p>Speaking to supporters in Hartlepool he said the party would not stand in the 317 seats won by the Conservatives in the last election in 2017.</p>
      <p>At the last election the Tories won or held seats in Devon in Central Devon, East Devon, Newton Abbot, North Devon, Plymouth Moor View, South West Devon, Tiverton and Honiton, Torridge and West Devon and Totnes.</p>
      <p>Labour were successful in Exeter and Plymouth Sutton and Devonport.</p>
      <p>In Cornwall the Conservatives held every single seat.</p>
      <p>He said he had taken the decision because he feared that if they had run it would have led to a hung Parliament with significant gains for the Liberal Democrats.</p>
      <p>The move is a significant boost for Boris Johnson amid warnings by Conservative ministers that they risked splitting the Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>"We've decided ourselves that we absolutely have to put country before party and take the fight to Labour," Mr Farage said.</p>

      <p>The Brexit Party leaders had previously warned the Tories that it would stand in 600 constituencies unless Boris Johnson abandoned his Brexit deal with Brussels.</p>
      <p>However, his offer of a "Leave alliance" electoral pact with the Conservatives was rejected by the Tories.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage said he still believed the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated with Brussels would not deliver "the Brext we voted for" in the 2016 referendum.</p>
      <p>However, he said he had been encouraged by statements by Mr Johnson at the weekend saying he would not extend the planned transition period beyond the end of 2020 and that he would seek a "super Canada plus" style free trade agreement with the EU.</p>

      <p>Mr Farage said: "Last night I weighed up Boris' promises, and is he going to stick to them against the threat particularly in the South and the South West that we let in a lot of Remainer Liberal Democrat MPs?</p>
      <p>"I think our action, this announcement today, prevents a second referendum from happening.</p>
      <p>"And that to me, I think right now, is the single most important thing in our country.</p>
      <p>"So in a sense we now have a Leave alliance, it's just that we've done it unilaterally."</p>
