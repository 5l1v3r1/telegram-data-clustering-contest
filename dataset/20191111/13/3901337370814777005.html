      <p>Cape Town City’s red-hot striker Kermit Erasmus has taken to social media to blast the standard of officiating in the Absa Premiership.</p>
      <p>Erasmus’ rant came after City succumbed to a 2-1 defeat in Thohoyandou against Black Leopards on Sunday afternoon.</p>

      <p>The match was not televised and the Port Elizabeth striker felt that it played a role in his side not being awarded a penalty. </p>
      <p>“Nothing new no tv no penalty!!!” he responded to his side’s tweet where they questioned the penalty snub. </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old further went on to plead with match officials to up their game when it comes to officiating. </p>
      <p>“All we ask for is better officiating we work every week extremely hard to give our best for each other and play to win, blatant penalty not given, I’m frustrated!!!!!” he added. </p>
