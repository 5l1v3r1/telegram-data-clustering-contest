      <h1>UFC exec responds to bizarre question from Russian reporter: ‘No, we won’t have children fighting in the UFC’</h1>

      <p>Only in Russia.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/televised-child-mma-fights-in-russia-draw-criticism/">No, really.</a>
      </p>
      <p>At Saturday’s UFC Fight Night 163 post-fight press conference in Moscow, UFC executive Dave Shaw was asked about the possibility of children — <i>yes, you heard that right, children</i> — fighting in the Octagon.</p>
      <p>The reporter only felt it necessary to ask, given the UFC’s decision to add women to its roster after Dana White had previously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4X6cUOQv6w">shot down the idea in 2011</a> (because, you know, women and children fighting in the Octagon is totally the same thing).</p>

      <p>“The UFC used to say they would never have women fighting. Now they have women fighting sometimes on the main cards. So will there ever be kids fighting in the UFC? Cause there are kids’ fights in other challenges,” the reporter asked (<a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/ufc-exec-shoots-down-the-idea-of-children-fighting-in-the-octagon/">h/t BJPenn.com</a>).</p>
      <p>“Children fighting in the UFC? No, we won’t have children fighting in the UFC,” Shaw responded.</p>
      <p>The UFC’s Fight Night event in Moscow this past Saturday saw top-five ranked featherweight contender Zabit Magomedsharipov cruise to a unanimous decision against No. 11-ranked Calvin Kattar. With the win, Magomedsharipov believes he should be next in line to fight the winner of Max Holloway vs. Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 245.</p>
