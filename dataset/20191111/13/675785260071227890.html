      <h1>FA Cup second round ball numbers confirmed for Monday night's draw</h1>
      <h2>After the weekend's FA Cup first round action, 56 teams are in the hat for the second round draw, one step away from potential Premier League opposition</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:15:59+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup">FA Cup</a> first round produced the goods over the weekend, with thrills, spills, heartbreak and much much more as Football League sides entered this year's competition.</p>
      <p>Now 56 teams take their place in the hat for the second round draw, knowing that they are one step away from a potential clash with one of the Premier League big boys.</p>
      <p>The lowest ranked side left are Chichester City, the non-league outfit who were handed a bye into round two following Bury's expulsion from the Football League.</p>
      <p>The side from step four of the Non-League period - who drew 2-2 with Sevenoaks Town over the weekend - are joined by another huge underdog in round two, Maldon &amp; Tiptree.</p>
      <p>The Essex outfit caused quite the stir with the biggest shock of round one, knocking out League Two side Leyton Orient.</p>
