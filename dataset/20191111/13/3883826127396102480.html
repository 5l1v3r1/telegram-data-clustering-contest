        <b>A pet Chihuahua had a "very lucky" escape when a bird of prey tried to snatch it, according to its owners.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sheila Gillanders, 72, said 18-month-old Emma was only saved thanks to the quick actions of her husband Robert.</p>
      <p>The buzzard-like bird tried to take the pet from their garden in Aberdeen's Stoneywood on Friday.</p>
      <p>But Mr Gillanders, 65, managed to get to the predator and release the dog from its talons. Emma is now recovering at home after being treated by a vet.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gillanders said: "We heard a bell and it was a bird of prey coming down - it must have escaped from its handler."</p>

      <p>She explained: "It pinned her against the fence. It only got so far up, but my husband was able to get the bird off her.</p>
      <p>"It then just looked at us. It was a really big bird, like a buzzard. It was definitely trained, as it was wearing a bell."</p>
      <p>Emma was taken to the vet, and is receiving medication.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gillanders hopes the appeal will lead to the bird's handler to come forward.</p>
      <p>Her owner added: "She is a bit bruised but otherwise she was not physically injured.</p>
      <p>"Her stress is sky-high and we are struggling to get her back out in the garden.</p>
      <p>"It was very lucky. If it had not been for my husband getting to her so quickly I dread to think what could have happened."</p>
