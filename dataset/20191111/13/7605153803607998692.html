        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 11 – Education Cabinet Secretary George Magoha on Monday defended Kenya National Examination Council’s (KNEC) decision to deploy Xylene – a colorless, sweet-</b>
        <b>smelling liquid solvent – in the ongoing Kenya Certificate for Secondary Education (KCSE) exams.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Magoha who was responding to safety concerns raised by Kenya Union of Post-Primary Education Teachers (KUPPET), said chemistry instructors had been trained on safe handling of the chemical.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“Most of chemicals used in chemistry are harmful, Xylene in this case is not as dangerous as Chlorine and Bromine and have been used since when I was in high school,” the CS pointed out.</p>
      <p>“Those people trying to make noise and misinforming the public may have expected a different substance.”</p>
      <p>He urged examination centres to take standard precautionary measures.</p>
      <p>The chemical was used by the students who sat for Chemistry Paper III – practical exam – and reportedly caused some teachers health complications, the KUPEET stated.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference in Nairobi, KUPPET Secretary General Akello Misori vowed to sue for damages on behalf of two teachers he said had developed breathing complications after handling the harmful chemical.</p>
      <p>“Many students and teachers have complained of the side effects after exposure the chemical,” he said.</p>
      <p>In Trans Nzoia county two teachers are said to be in hospital after being exposed to Xylene.</p>
      <p>The two teachers were assigned to Tidae Girls High School in Kwanza and St. Monica Girls High School in Kitale.</p>
      <p>In the second incident, an expectant supervisor was admitted at Galilee Medical Center for further medical examination.</p>
      <p>KUPPET accused KNEC of failing to recommend the use of safe chemicals, saying other than health complications, there were no proper disposal measures put in place.</p>
      <p>The union said safe handling of the solvent required the use of gloves and protective glasses.</p>
      <p>KUPPET noted Xylene can only be used in a properly ventilated laboratory and in most cases would require mechanical ventilation also referred to as artificial ventilation.</p>
      <p>The chemical can cause headache, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea sleepiness, stumbling, irregular heartbeat, fainting, irritating to the skin, eyes and lungs.</p>
      <p>Acute ingestion of the chemical can lead to deaths, according to online taxology registries.</p>
      <p>“We urge the KNEC to adopt well-established safety measures to protect teachers and students during future practical exams,” Misori said.</p>
