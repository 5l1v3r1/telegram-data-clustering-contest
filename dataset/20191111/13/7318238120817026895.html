      <p>The captain of South Africa's national rugby team returned with his teammates to his hometown after winning the World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>Siya Kolisi is the first black captain of the national rugby team, known as the Springboks.</p>
      <p>In South Africa, where apartheid was in place until the early 1990s, the national rugby team used to be made up mostly of white players.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Springboks visited Port Elizabeth -- Kolisi's hometown -- as part of a victory tour of the country.</p>
      <p>The players were greeted by an exuberant crowd. Supporters cheered when he raised the Webb Ellis Cup while standing on top a double-decker bus.</p>
      <p>The team is touring South Africa after winning 32-12 over England.</p>
