      <p>It's been 120 days since Barcelona's 2019-20 campaign began on July 14. In the following four months, Barcelona's four summer signings have played very different roles. While goalkeeper Neto is still unknown to the supporters, Frenkie de Jong has already won their hearts.</p>
      <p>All four are excellent players, signed to improve a squad that flagged at the last hurdle last season. Going into the latest international break, it feels like a good time to have a look at home Neto, De Jong, Antoine Griezmann and Junior Firpo have got on.</p>
      <p><b>NETO. Unkown:</b> The former Valencia goalkeeper came in to replace Jasper Cillessen as Marc-Andre ter Stegen's No.2. He declared that he arrived to fight for the gloves and take the German's place, but that has not been possible. At first, because he was injured and out of action for several weeks and now, fit again, because Ter Stegen remains in excellent form.</p>

      <p><b>JUNIOR FIRPO. Time (played five, 324 minutes, one goal). </b>The young left-back (23) has not had an easy integration. His goal for Real Betis at Camp Nou last season showcased his quality but he has to compete with Jordi Alba. An injury has also seen him miss games. However, he's shown a competitive spirit and, despite making a huge error in his first start at Granada, he has recovered well. He scored in the win at Getafe a few weeks later. When he's played, he has shown what he's about and there's still belief he can have a future at Barcelona.</p>
      <p><b>DE JONG. Impressive (played 16, 1,308 minutes, one goal, one assist). </b>The ease with which he links with teammates, his vision, the balance he adds, his versatility... Frenkie's still not hit the levels he reached with Ajax last season but he is, without doubt, one of the side's best players so far this season. As is natural, he has played across the midfield, as a pivote and an interior. He has everything to go on to have a brilliant career at the Catalan club.</p>
      <p><b>GRIEZMANN. Adapting (played 15, 1,210 minutes, four goals, three assists). </b>The France forward's situation is not so simple. After turning down the club in 2018, he had to win the fans and the squad around. It's clear that some want him to show his commitment before they bless his signing. Wearing the No.17 shirt, he now finds himself competing for a place with Dembele and Ansu Fati. He has scored and assisted, although he has still not properly connected with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez as hoped. Ernesto Valverde needs to achieve that to get the trio ticking and the goals flowing. His talent and goal-scoring remains intact but so far it's his effort and work rate which have stood out.</p>
