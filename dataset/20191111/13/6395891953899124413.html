      <p>The Istanbul governor's office said that "comprehensive administrative and judicial investigations into Le Mesurier's death have been initiated."</p>
      <p>Anadolu said police established that no one had entered or left his home at the time of the incident, and believe he may have fallen to his death.</p>
      <p>Le Mesurier was the founder and CEO of May Day Rescue, which founded and trained the White Helmets also known as the Syria Civil Defense.</p>
      <p>The private DHA news agency said authorities were investigating whether he had committed suicide, saying he had allegedly been on anti-depressant pills. Anadolu also reported that Le Mesurier's wife told police her husband had been taking medicine to treat "intense stress."</p>
