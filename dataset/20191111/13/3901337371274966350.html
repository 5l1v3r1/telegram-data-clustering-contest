      <h1>Khune To Play Hero For Chiefs?</h1>

      <p>The stage has been set for Itumeleng Khune to make a sensational return for Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout, but the question remains – will he make it in time?</p>

      </p>
      <p>Khune has battled with injuries of late, so much so that he’s made just two appearances in all competitions in 2019 so far as he dealt with first a shoulder problem and now a groin injury. </p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp had said that the Amakhosi stopper would be out for the whole of October, but when November came around he was still nowhere to be seen as Daniel Akpeyi kept his place between the sticks and Bruce Bvuma sat on the bench. </p>
      <p>Now, with Akpeyi’s yellow card against Orlando Pirates meaning that he faces a one-game ban, Middendorp may look to call on the Bafana Bafana international to take his place in goal in the TKO semifinal against Maritzburg United if he’s fit enough after the international break. </p>
      <p>Khune does have a few weeks to get himself back to match fitness before the clash with the Team of Choice, but it may also be a game that comes too soon for the 32-year-old as he seeks a return to action once again. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Chiefs’ recent decision to re-sign Brylon Petersen may well have been with Khune’s situation in mind as they approach their battle for a spot in the TKO final, and Petersen may find himself into the matchday squad at the end of this month while Bvuma takes the spot opened up by Akpeyi’s suspension.</p>

        <b>If fit, do you think Khune should start v Maritzburg?  </b>
