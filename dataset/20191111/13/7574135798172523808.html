      <p>Earlier today, the news made the rounds that <b>Drake</b> was <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/drake-booed-off-stage-during-surprise-camp-flog-gnaw-set/">booed off stage</a> during his surprise headlining appearance at <b>Tyler, the Creator</b>‘s Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival because it was rumored that Frank Ocean would be headlining, and Drake is not Frank Ocean. Tyler has now responded:</p>
