      <p>Harlequin have looked to the round ball game for their new CEO, announcing the appointment of Laurie Dalrymple as Chief Executive.</p>
      <p>Dalrymple was Managing Director at Wolverhampton Wanderers until July 2019, having enjoyed a very successful five years at the Premier League football club. During his time at Wolves, Dalrymple oversaw significantly increased turnover for the club, including a number of record sponsorship deals and greatly improved fan engagement.</p>
      <p>Prior to Wolves, Dalrymple was the Executive Director at the Ricoh Arena, and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals">International</a> Sales Director at global event producer, EMAP.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> fan, 44-year-old Dalrymple is looking forward to his new role, saying: “While I’ve worked in football most recently, rugby has always been my passion. Following an inspiring Rugby World Cup, CVC’s investment into the League and a growing supporter base globally and locally, rugby, and more importantly Harlequins, are well placed to capitalise on these exciting times. I’m thrilled to be appointed Chief Executive of Harlequins.</p>
      <p>“Harlequins is one of the best known brands in club rugby and I can’t wait to help it realise its potential.”</p>
      <p>David Morgan, Harlequins’ Chairman added: “We are delighted that Laurie is joining us at Harlequins. We believe he is an outstanding appointment as Chief Executive. Laurie brings with him a wealth of experience from the Premier League where he helped transform Wolves from a Championship club to an established member of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“I would again also like to thank David Ellis (our outgoing Chief Executive) for all his dedication, hard work and achievements over the past eight years. On behalf of the board and all at the club, I wish David all the very best and every success in his future endeavours.”</p>
