      <h1>The Mega Man X Legacy Collections join Mega Man 11 in the million-seller club</h1>

      <p>Recently we learned that <i>Mega Man 11</i>, which arrived back in October of 2018, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../the-resident-evil-2-remake-is-sooooo-close-to-passing-the-original-s-lifetime-sales-571927.phtml">just hit the million-shipped mark</a> in roughly a year and change, but now we have some additional data on how the franchise is doing thanks to series producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya.</p>
      <p>Although the recent Capcom financial report focused on <i>11</i>, Tsuchiya reports of his own accord that the <i>Mega Man X Legacy Collection 1 + 2</i> (released July 2018) just hit 1.4 million units, and the <i>Mega Man </i>[Classic] <i>Legacy Collection 1 + 2</i> (released August 2015) hit 2 million units.</p>
      <p>There's a lot to unpack, most notably the fact that the <i>Mega Man</i> series is still very much alive and well, but notice the disparity between those two releases. <i>Mega Man X</i> was already credited with reviving the series and bringing it into a new generation decades ago, and now, in the modern era, it's selling nearly as well in just one year as the classic series has in four years.</p>
      <p>Capcom has to see that there's still a huge demand for the <i>X</i> series, which is why so many people think that a new <i>X</i> game is on the way. Either way the publisher <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../capcom-re-iterates-that-the-assumed-mega-man-12-project-is-still-underway-566989.phtml">is working on something <i>Mega Man</i> related</a>: whether that's <i>12</i> or <i>X9</i> (or both) is something we'll learn with time. </p>
