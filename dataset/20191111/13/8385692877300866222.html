      <p>Those of you who are planning to purchase the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> Galaxy S11 are probably wondering what color variants will it be available in. Well, a tipster has just shared that <a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1193770335214063617">info</a>, in <a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-s11e/">partnership</a> with MySmartPrice, for all Galaxy S11 variants.</p>
      <p>This information comes from Ishan Agarwal, a well-known tipster. He revealed what color variants will the Galaxy S11e, S11, and S11+ be available in. In addition to that, he also talked about a new pair of Galaxy Buds.</p>
      <h3>The Galaxy S11 series color variants have been revealed</h3>
      <p>The Galaxy S11e will ship in Blue, Gray, and Pink colors, it seems. The S11 will be available in Blue, Gray, and Black color variants, according to him. He noted that the Galaxy S11 could ship in some additional options, though.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy S10 Lite will be available in Black, Blue, and White options. In addition to that, he also said that the Galaxy Note 10 lite is coming. That device will be offered in Red, Silver (possibly Aura), and Black color variants.</p>
      <p>The new Galaxy Buds are in development, it seems. They're carrying the SM-R175 model number, and coming in Blue, Pink, Black, and White colors.</p>
      <p>Now, we already know what will the screen sizes of the Galaxy S11 series be. That information got shared by Evan Blass recently. He said that we're in for three different sizes of the Galaxy S11, similar to the Galaxy S10.</p>

      <p>This time around, however, all variants will include curved displays. All variants will also include larger displays, compared to the Galaxy S11 series.</p>
      <h3>Evan Blass revealed Galaxy S11 display sizes quite recently</h3>
      <p>The Galaxy S11e is said to include a 6.2 or a 6.4-inch display. The S11 will sport a 6.7-inch panel, while the Galaxy S11+ will feature a 6.9-inch display. The Galaxy S10 handsets, in comparison, featured 5.8-inch, 6.1-inch, and 6.4-inch panels.</p>
      <p>Mr. Blass also said that the Galaxy S11 series will come in five models. All three Galaxy S11 handsets will be offered in 4G LTE variants, while the Galaxy S11e and S11 will ship in 5G iterations as well.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 series is expected to launch in mid-to-late February, says Mr. Blass. That is actually exactly what we expected, as Samsung is expected to announce the Galaxy S11 prior to the MWC.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 series will probably be made out of metal and glass. A display camera hole will probably be included as well, but we don't know if it will be centered at the top of the display, or not.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 series will ship with Android 10, and Samsung's One UI on top of it. The Snapdragon 865 / Exynos 9830 will fuel these phones, and you can expect them to include plenty of RAM and UFS 3.0 storage.</p>
