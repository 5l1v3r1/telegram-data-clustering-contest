      <h1>Is the Premier League title race over? Our reporters discuss whether Liverpool will be caught</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool are bidding to win a first league title since 1990. Sunday's win over Manchester City extended their lead at the summit to eight points</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T13:05:41+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> took a huge advantage in the Premier League title race as their 3-1 win opened up a nine-point gap over opponents Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Leicester, eight points behind, are now their closest challengers after City's miserable run at Anfield - one win in 29 visits - continued in a match which left Pep Guardiola raging at some controversial VAR calls.</p>
      <p>Fabinho could not have timed his first goal since December any better with the sixth-minute opener, with City still arguing for a handball by Trent Alexander-Arnold in the other penalty area, and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-3-1-man-city-20854920">Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane put the game out of sight</a> before a late consolation for Bernardo Silva.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have now faced all their big-six rivals plus Leicester while City have plenty of work left to do, having only met the Reds and Tottenham up to this point.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/roy-keane-jose-mourinho-full-20858074">Jose Mourinho and Roy Keane reckon Liverpool will go on to lift the trophy</a> for the first time since 1990.</p>
      <p>But can City overturn the deficit and win a third third title in a row? Our reporters have their say:</p>

      <p>It’s over in as much as I think Liverpool will be champions. It’ll take some twists and turns but I’m convinced <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will do it.</p>
      <p>Beating City was a huge statement and they were deserved winners no matter the controversies.</p>
      <p>I think they’ve got a great keeper, the best full backs in the Premier League, the best centre half, the best front three and Fabinho looks a world beater in midfield.</p>
      <p>They are ahead of the rest with a big lead.</p>
      <p>The biggest danger is from themselves and the crazy fixture list made worse by the Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I think it’s Liverpool’s title.</p>

      <h3>David McDonnell</h3>
      <p>It's not over, but it's certainly Liverpool's title to lose now.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> made up a seven-point gap at the turn of the year, to pip Liverpool to the title, but it's hard to see Jurgen Klopp's side squandering such a commanding lead again, given the relentless form they're currently in.</p>
      <p>Much depends on injuries. City have suffered hugely with the loss of key players, including Aymeric Laporte and Leroy Sane, as well as Ederson for the 3-1 defeat at Anfield, but Liverpool have not been hit by such enforced absences.</p>
      <p>If Liverpool can keep key players fit for the rest of the season, it's hard to see past them ending their 30-year wait for the title.</p>

      <h3>Andy Dunn</h3>
      <p>The title race is not over. Liverpool might have forgotten how to lose but the demands on Jurgen Klopp’s squad will be intense over the next couple of months.</p>
      <p>But if they falter, it might not be Manchester City who stand up as the main challengers. I honestly cannot see Pep Guardiola’s side posting a long run of victories with THAT defence.</p>
      <p>It is as likely <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City chase down Liverpool as it is City.</p>

      <h3>Neil McLeman</h3>
      <p>Eight points in November is a big lead but history tells us the Premier League is not over.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have to compete with a busy fixture list in five competitions and the weight of history as the pressure will mount in the closing weeks.</p>
      <p>In the Premier League, they still have to visit Leicester (on Boxing Day after the FIFA World Club Cup), <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> and Man City.</p>
      <p>And they visit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> and host Chelsea in two of their last three games. Just two defeats - or any injury to Virgil van Dijk or Roberto Firminio - will throw the race wide open again.</p>

      <h3>James Nursey</h3>
      <p>I expect Liverpool to win the Premier League in 2020 but i don't think you can call the race over already in November 2019.</p>
      <p>The pressure on Jurgen Klopp's side to claim the club's first top-flight title since 1989/90 is going to hit unprecedented levels as they get closer to achieving it.</p>
      <p>No big team in the recent modern multi-media Premier League era has had to an endure a wait like this before for lifting a crown.</p>
      <p>So the scrutiny and anticipation will hit fresh heights as the finishing line gets closer.</p>
      <p>Pressure can do strange things to even the most hardened of sportspeople.</p>
      <p>So let's see, it will be be fascinating.</p>
      <p>And you also have to factor in the potential for injuries which as Manchester City will attest, can badly affect a team.</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>David Anderson</h3>
      <p>Obviously Liverpool’s nine-point advantage over Manchester City puts them in a great position, but it is far too early to say the title race is over.</p>
      <p>There are 26 games to go and Liverpool let slip a bigger lead over City at a much-later stage of the campaign last season when they were 10 points clear at the turn of the year.</p>
      <p>Liverpool also lost the 2014 title race to the Blues when they were in the box seat with just three games to go.</p>
      <p>Jordan Henderson was a member of both squads and he will remind his team-mates that they have won nothing yet should anyone start feeling too giddy.</p>
      <p>Factor in also City’s ability to put together a 15-match winning streak like they did last season and Pep Guardiola’s superhuman side cannot be written off.</p>
      <p>City are in a bad place with injuries and they will come back strongly like they always do.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s Reds must negotiate a difficult December and January when they must go to Qatar to play in FIFA’s World Club Cup.</p>
      <p>They have to rearrange their match away to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , where they dropped two points last season, and have a testing trip to Leicester on Boxing Day in their first game back from the Middle East.</p>
      <p>In January they then play Tottenham away and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> at home and Liverpool will do well to come through all this with a nine-point lead intact.</p>
      <p>Liverpool must also contend with the weight of history bearing down on them and their fans are desperate to see them win the club’s first title since 1990.</p>
      <p>This anxiety affected Liverpool around January and February time last season and they dropped precious points as a result.</p>
      <p>So no-one inside the Liverpool dressing room will be dreaming of title glory just yet and instead they will be focused on picking up another three points against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> .</p>

      <h3>Tom Hopkinson</h3>
      <p>Not at all. It's hard to see Liverpool losing it now - they look too good and too confident for that.</p>
      <p>But just as they've opened up eight and nine-point leads over the rest of the top four in 12 games, that gap can be closed in 16.</p>
      <p>We don't know what injuries and suspensions lie in store for them, either. It's a long way from being done but, that said, it will be an almighty surprise if they don't see it through now.</p>
      <h3>Alex Richards</h3>
      <p>We’re a third of the way through the season and Liverpool are eight points clear and there is no doubt that they are heavy favourites to go on and finally win the Premier League.  <br/>Quite frankly, they will never have a better chance.</p>
      <p>But they were seven points clear at one stage last season and didn’t go on to secure the championship, so to suggest it’s over already - not for me.</p>
      <p>There’s still a long way to go in this season’s race, and there are likely to be a few bumps in the road for Jurgen Klopp’s men, be it injury, results, whatever.</p>
      <p>At that point it will be all about how they react, and whether anyone can take advantage.  <br/>They’re out in front for a reason right now, but the job is far from done.</p>
