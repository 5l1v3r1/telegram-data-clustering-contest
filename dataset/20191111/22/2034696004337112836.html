      </p>
      <p>Chris Evans has discussed the future of Captain America, and whether he’d be open to playing the character again in the future.</p>
      <p>He was sitting down with Scarlett Johansson as part of <i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/chris-evans-scarlett-johansson-captain-america-marvel-1203399020/">Variety</a></i>‘s Actors on Actors series.</p>

      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/chris-evans-retires-playing-captain-america-playing-role-last-8-years-honour-2386814">Evans revealed that he’d shot his last scene as Captain America</a>, calling it “an honour” to play the character for the last 8 years.</p>
      <p>Now, he’s left the door open for a potential return to the role.</p>
      <p>Asked by Johansson, who is getting her own origin story as Black Widow as part of Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whether he’d play the role again, Evans said: “You never say never. I love the character. I don’t know. It’s not a hard no, but it’s not an eager yes either.</p>

      <p>“There are other things that I’m working on right now. I think Cap had such a tricky act to stick the landing, and I think they did a really nice job letting him complete his journey. If you’re going to revisit it, it can’t be a cash grab.</p>
      <p>“It can’t be just because the audience wants to be excited. What are we revealing? What are we adding to the story? A lot of things would have to come together.”</p>
      <p>Johansson went on to call Captain America’s finale in Avengers: Endgame a “beautiful, cathartic ending,” to which Evans responded: “It’d be a shame to sour that. I’m very protective of it. It was such a precious time, and jumping onto the movie was a terrifying prospect to me.</p>
      <p>“I said no a bunch of times, and there’s a million and one ways it could have gone wrong. It almost feels like maybe we should let this one sit.”</p>
      <p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/captain-america-jedi-chris-evans-wants-part-star-wars-2551769">Evans hinted that he wants to play a part in a new <i>Star Wars</i> movie</a>.</p>
