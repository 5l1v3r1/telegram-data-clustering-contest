      <h1>Dolly Parton has multiple tattoos 'to cover scars or things'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:43:35+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:43</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Napoli</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/dolly-parton">Dolly Parton</a> loves to show off her figure but she never bares her arms in public, and now the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/country">country music star</a> is explaining why.</p>
      <p>The 73-year-old <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">singer-songwriter</a> revealed in an interview with "<a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/news/story/dolly-parton-opens-song-inspirations-aunt-dolly-female-66801989">Good Morning America</a>'s" Robin Roberts on Monday that she doesn't reveal too much skin because of multiple small tattoos.</p>
      <p>"I got them to cover scars or things," Parton explained. "If I have to get a scar for any reason, I never can kind of get rid of that purple look. So I thought, 'Well, I'm going to kind of decorate these with some flowers or little butterflies or whatever.'"</p>

      <p>But back in 2014 on "<a href="http://www.today.com/video/today/55165020#55165020">Today</a>," she clarified that it doesn't mean she has tattoo sleeves.</p>
      <p>"People said the other day that the reason you wear sleeves is that you have snake tattoos all over you, and I said, "No, I don't,"' she said at the time.</p>
      <p>"I'm not really one to have tattoos, but I do have a few and they're not where you can see them."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Roseanne Barr revealed Parton's secret back in 2011 when she was on Craig Ferguson's late-night show. "Do you know who's totally tattooed? I shouldn't even tell this. Dolly Parton is totally tattooed," she said.</p>

      <p>"She showed me. She's got all these awesome tattoos all over her body — no black or blue lines, all like, pastel gorgeous bows all over everything," Barr added.</p>

      <p>Parton also reflected on all her success over the past six decades in a male-dominated industry.</p>

      <p>“It’s just a country Cinderella story, really,” said Parton, who has previously been open about her childhood and growing up "in a very poor family."</p>
