      <h2>Warnock has left his post at Cardiff City and is set to retire after a career that has witnessed plenty of ups and downs, but never a dull moment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:20:27+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/neil-warnock">Neil Warnock</a> is one of life’s great characters and football will be poorer without him.</p>
      <p>Warnock, who is 71 next month, has had a wonderful career in which he set records as he became the promotion specialist amid the rows, dressing room rants and the manager every rival fan loves to hate.</p>
      <p>But Warnock perhaps endured more highs and lows in his last job with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff City</a> than with any of his other 14 clubs in his remarkable 39 year managerial career.</p>
      <p>His greatest achievement of all was arguably to lead Cardiff into the Premier League in 2018 because it epitomised what Warnock is all about.</p>
      <p>A no-nonsense old school motivator who gets the very best out of players, gets them to run through brick walls for him and they did just that because here was a Championship squad suddenly in the multi-million pound top flight.</p>

      <p>They gave it an incredible fight to stay up amid the most heartbreaking and tragic circumstances that Cardiff had ever known.</p>
      <p>The Emiliano Sala tragedy in January was something that rocked Warnock to the very core and, by his own admission, he came very close to walking away last season because he was so gripped by grief.</p>
      <p>Sala was due to be Cardiff’s record signing, was joining from Nantes and yet was involved in a plane crash and the tragedy was felt by the whole of football. Cardiff was united in grief.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Warnock has been a fighter throughout his career and yet, one cold Monday at the Cardiff hotel the club uses to train last January, he struggled to hold back the tears when talking about Sala.</p>
      <p>Gone was the effervescent Warnock, full of jokes and a cheeky smile, the man who was fantastic company and always entertainment.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Replaced with a shell of a man and it is a great tribute to Warnock that he was able to carry on through the tragedy and, in a highly-emotional parting statement, that was one of the first things he mentioned.</p>
      <p>It perhaps put life back in perspective for Warnock who actually retired but it was his wife Sharon who persuaded him to take another job because she could see he was itching to get back as she recovered from breast cancer treatment.</p>

      <p>Again, that is typical Warnock. He absolutely hates being out of football and, despite having said in August this would be his last year in management, there is still a few months left so don’t bet against it.</p>
      <p>And there is a reason why chairman and chief executives have kept turning back to Warnock despite his reputation for being old school, for digging out referees, for losing the plot on the touchline and for various televised rants at players.</p>
      <p>Warnock has set an incredible record of winning eight promotions, somehow building teams and a dressing room spirit to get players over the line.</p>
      <p>His career has, of course, had disappointments with the sense of unfinished business of desperately keeping just one of those clubs in the top flight.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>From Notts County to his beloved Sheffield United, later QPR and Crystal Palace and now Cardiff, his career has been full of achievements which deserve to be celebrated.</p>
      <p>But despite the relegations and setbacks, no-one should underestimate the feat of getting them there in the first place.</p>
      <p>Warnock is a great character and football will miss him. Despite the frustrations of this season, Cardiff fans were the first to pay tribute to one of English football’s most entertaining and best loved managers.</p>
