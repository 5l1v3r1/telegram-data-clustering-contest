      <p>A migrant wearing a wetsuit has been saved by a ferry off the coast of Calais in northern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a> after he tried to swim across the Channel to Britain, maritime authorities have said.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the crew of the Pride of Canterbury P&amp;O ferry spotted the man, understood to be in his 30s, about 12 miles off the French coast. The ferry made a U-turn to “retrieve him from the sea”, the French maritime authorities for the Channel and North Sea said.</p>
      <p>The man was suffering from “severe hypothermia” and was taken by a French navy helicopter to a hospital in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/calais">Calais</a>, authorities said.</p>
      <p>At least four migrants have died so far this year attempting to make the dangerous crossing in the Channel, with its strong currents and very cold waters.</p>
      <p>In October, two young Iraqi men were found dead on a beach in Le Touquet in northern France. And in August, a 30-year-old Iraqi woman perished when she fell off a boat overcrowded with migrants. Then the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/27/body-of-iraqi-migrant-who-tried-to-swim-to-britain-found-off-belgium">body of an Iraqi man </a>who tried to swim across the Channel was found off the coast of Belgium.</p>
