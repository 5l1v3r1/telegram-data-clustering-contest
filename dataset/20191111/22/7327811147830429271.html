      <p>MILLBURN, New Jersey (WABC) -- A major water main break forced the closure and evacuation of a popular New Jersey mall Monday.</p>
      <p>Officials for The Mall At Short Hills said the rupture occurred underneath the mall.</p>
      <p>Power was shut off to the entire building, and the mall was evacuated.</p>
      <p>"We are assessing the situation and hope to re-open today," officials <a href="https://www.facebook.com/themallatshorthills/posts/3086906304654039">said in a Facebook post</a>. "Please check back for updates."</p>
      <p>A short time later, officials announced the mall would remain closed for the remainder of Monday. It is unclear when it will reopen.</p>
      <p>The mall was shut down very slowly, with the major stores shutting down last.</p>
      <p>A security guard tells Eyewitness News that the problem is an underground water main that feeds the malls fire suppression system.</p>
      <p>The water for the bathrooms is still operating.</p>
      <p>The break apparently happened inside an electrical supply area, so power was shut down as a precaution.</p>
