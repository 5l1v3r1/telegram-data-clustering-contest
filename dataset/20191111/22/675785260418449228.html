      <h1>Wayne Rooney's son Kai takes after Man Utd legend dad with stunning free-kick goal</h1>
      <h2>Young Kai netted a brilliant strike at the weekend - though unlike his father it was scored with his favoured left boot</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:04:34+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:04</time> by <a rel="author">Ned Keating</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">Wayne Rooney's</a> eldest son Kai appears to have inherited his father's footballing ability after footage emerged of the youngster scoring a sublime goal at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Man Utd</a> legend would surely have been proud after watching the 10-year-old net a brilliant free-kick from distance, much like he did in his pomp.</p>
      <p>Kai was also clearly pleased with the effort as he uploaded it to his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account, with the video already clocking up close to 5,000 views.</p>
      <p>In the clip, the young Rooney can be seen lining up a set-piece for his team, playing in yellow, and methodically paced backwards before beginning his run-up.</p>

      <p>Unlike his father, who was famously strong on his favoured right foot, Kai struck his effort with his left peg and watched as it sailed over the keeper and into the net.</p>
      <p>The youngster then wheeled away in delight with all the exuberance you would expect of someone that image, before completing his celebration with a twist onto the floor.</p>
      <p>The strike was just one of 10 in the match between Kai's team and the opposition, with Wayne's eldest son revealing the match had finished in a thrilling 5-5 draw in his post on Instagram.</p>

      <p>The footage came to light just days after it emerged that Kai would be offered a place in the academy of Utd's fierce rivals City.</p>
      <p>The Rooney clan are heading back to England after a year-long spell in the USA with MLS side DC United after Wayne agreed a deal with Sky Bet Championship side Derby.</p>

      <p>Kai has already had spells in the youth set-ups at both City and Utd prior to making the switch across the Atlantic with his famous father.</p>
      <p>And though Wayne is the Red Devils' all-time leading goalscorer, his son may well end his developing his footballing talents in the blue half of Manchester.</p>
