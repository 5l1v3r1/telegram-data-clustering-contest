      <p>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (Reuters) - The next adventure in the “Star Wars” movie and TV franchise, arriving Tuesday on Walt Disney Co’s new streaming service, takes place on a lawless planet at the outer reaches of the galaxy.</p>
      <p>“The Mandalorian,” an eight-episode live-action series, stars “Game of Thrones” actor Pedro Pascal as a helmeted bounty hunter. It will be available on Disney+, a new $7-per-month online subscription meant to compete with Netflix Inc.</p>
      <p>As is typical with “Star Wars,” Disney and the cast have revealed little about the plot.</p>
      <p>“Just kind of imagine crossing the borders and going into unknown territory ... with a lot of familiar elements and completely brand new elements,” Pascal said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
      <p>“The Mandalorian” is set between the events of “Return of the Jedi” and “The Force Awakens,” the sixth and seventh installments in the “Star Wars” movie saga.</p>
      <p>Disney will release the first episode on Tuesday and the second on Friday, followed by one installment each Friday after that.</p>
