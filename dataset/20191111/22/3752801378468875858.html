      <h1>Drought-hit Zimbabwe to transfer thousands of animals</h1>

      <p>Zimbabwe's wildlife agency said on Monday it would move hundreds of elephants and other animals in a dramatic bid to save them from a lethal drought.</p>
      <p>At least 120 elephants have already died over the past two months as the country grapples with one of the worst droughts in its history.</p>
      <p>"We are moving 600 elephants, two prides of lion comprising between five and 10 members, a pack of wild dogs, 50 buffalo, 40 giraffes and 2 000 impalas," parks and wildlife authority spokesperson Tinashe Farawo told AFP.</p>
      <p>The animals will be moved from Save Conservancy, a major park in southeastern Zimbabwe, to three other game reserves.</p>
      <p>"This will be the biggest translocation in our history," said Farawo.</p>
      <p>Permits for the operation have already been secured, Farawo said.</p>
      <p>The transfer will start "during the rain season, when pastures and foliage start flourishing," he added. The rain season usually kicks off from around the middle of November.</p>
      <p>"We want to avoid a situation where we trans-locate animals, only for them to starve to death because there is no food in their new habitat," he explained.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Human-and-animal conflict'</b>
      </p>
      <p>The relocation was announced after the death of dozens of elephants in Hwange, Zimbabwe's biggest game reserve, located in the northwest of the country.</p>
      <p>Hungry elephants have been breaking out of wildlife areas and raiding human settlements in search for food, posing a threat to communities.</p>
      <p>Farawo said 200 people have died in "human-and-animal conflict" over the past five years.</p>
      <p>Several southern African countries are in the grip of one of the worst droughts in decades, caused by months of above-average temperatures and erratic rainfall.</p>
      <p>This year's drought has wilted grasslands and dried up water holes, making it increasingly difficult for animals to survive.</p>
      <p>Botswana last month announced that more than 100 elephants had died in two months in its famed Chobe National Park.</p>
      <p>The drought has left more than five million rural Zimbabweans - nearly a third of the population - at risk of food shortages before the next harvest in 2020, the UN has warned.</p>
      <p>Food shortages for people have been amplified by the combined effects of drought and the country's enduring economic crisis.</p>
