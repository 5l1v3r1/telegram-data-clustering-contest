      <p>CHICO, Calif. -- A Chico, California police officer says a man gave her a "fright" when a lizard suddenly jumped out of of his coat pocket during a search.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChicoPoliceDepartment/videos/437584783620492/?v=437584783620492">Chico Police Department </a>shared the video on its Facebook page. It shows the officer screaming before laughing it off and asking the man if he has any other "creepy critters" in his pocket.</p>
      <p>"You gave me a heart attack," says the officer, still laughing. "That is not cool."</p>
      <p>The man being searched apologizes and says he forgot about it.</p>
      <p>The man also didn't get to keep the lizard. A second officer in the video can be heard saying, "unfortunately, he ran off."</p>
      <p>The Chico Police Department did not reveal the man's identity or why he was being searched.</p>
      <p>The video is getting a lot of reaction on Facebook, mostly praising the officers for the way they handled the situation.</p>
      <p>"Way to work with this human with kindness and humor! I'm sure it brightened his day and yours!" read one comment.</p>
      <p>"This officer handled this well, with humor. Love our CPD officers!" another comment said.</p>
      <p>"He said: well Terry, unfortunately, you can't keep your lizard -Chico quote of the day," wrote another user.</p>
      <p>The Chico Police Department added its own comment.</p>
      <p>"Lizard attack! Just another day on patrol," police wrote on the video post.</p>
