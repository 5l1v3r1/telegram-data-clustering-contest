      <h1>Great Britain identity and coaching appointment all wrong, says Warrington chief</h1>
      <h2>Karl Fitzpatrick believes the Lions tour Down Under has been a missed opportunity on all fronts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:00:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Walker, https://www.facebook.com/GarethWalkerMirror/</a></address>
      <p>Warrington chief executive and former Ireland international Karl Fitzpatrick says the Lions tour has descended into farce - and that Wayne Bennett should never have been appointed coach.</p>
      <p>Bennett has come under fire both for three disappointing defeats and his comments that selection has been based around England’s plans for the 2021 World Cup.</p>
      <p>The veteran Australian is out of contract this month and Fitzpatrick says his appointment by the RFL has been part of the problem in Great Britain’s first outing in 12 years.</p>
      <p>Fitzpatrick said: “It’s become a farce and very disappointing. Selection was questionable with six half-backs and two wingers - when that came out there was a lot of eyebrows raised and rightly so.</p>

      <p>“The rationale behind it suggested it was a trial period for England, and that has diluted and devalued the iconic British brand. I think it’s criminal.</p>
      <p>“It’s absolutely a missed opportunity - this was a real chance to propel not only Great Britain as a brand but rugby league in this country, in Scotland, Ireland and Wales.</p>
      <p>“What’s worse is that it’s self-sabotage in the way we've gone about things. In my opinion Great Britain should absolutely have had its own coach, its own identity, social media channels, and a separate strategy.</p>
      <p>“It had to be Great Britain and not an England train-on squad or trial period, that’s just ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>Wales coach John Kear also believes the “blurred lines” between Great Britain and England have unfairly hampered his players such as winger Regan Grace, who has been overlooked. And Kear dismissed notions that the defeats have been because Super League playmakers are not up to their NRL equivalents.</p>
      <p>Kear said: “I can’t accept that.</p>

      <p>“Jonny Lomax has been the best pivot in the northern hemisphere this year, and of the two half-backs, Gareth Widdop hasn’t yet played in Super League, and all but a year and a half of Jackson Hasting’s development has been in the NRL.</p>
      <p>“Josh Hodgson’s main years playing at the top have been in the NRL - it just doesn’t wash with me.</p>
      <p>“We’ve not functioned as well as we could have as a team, and I don’t think it’s been understood what the Lions has been all about.</p>
      <p>“The blurred lines between what is Great Britain and what’s England have made it difficult to regain that identity and that’s been the problem. Regan Grace wasn’t considered because he’s not in the England Knights set-up - but how can he be if he's Welsh?</p>
      <p>“But we absolutely should stick with Great Britain if it's scheduled properly in the cycle and treated accordingly.”</p>
