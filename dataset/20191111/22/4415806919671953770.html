      <p>Mike Bushell has revealed he could not see a thing when he got stuck under partner Katya Jones’s skirt during his last dance on Strictly.</p>
      <p>The pair had taken to the dancefloor after getting eliminated during Sunday’s results show and things went wrong when the BBC Breakfast star picked Jones up – and got completely smothered in her dress.</p>
      <p>Speaking on spin-off It Takes Two, Bushell admitted: “I couldn’t see!</p>

      <p>“It was the move from the Charleston, the aeroplane move from the end.</p>
      <p>“I thought, let’s do a bit of that, but obviously the paso doble involves a long skirt…</p>
      <p>“I was turning around and I couldn’t see! It was, ‘Where am I?’”</p>
      <p>Bushell and Jones got the boot from the BBC show after a dance-off against Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice.</p>
      <p>After being eliminated, he led a conga around the ballroom.</p>
      <p>The star said despite getting his marching orders, he was “still on a real high”.</p>
      <p>He said: “I thought, if you are going to go out, you want to go out on a high.</p>
      <p>“I had checked with Katya. It would have been really insensitive if I had been conga-ing around the ballroom and then suddenly Katya is in tears… so I did check with Katya first, and honestly that has got to be one of the best moments of my life.”</p>

      <p>“To go out like that and to get Bruno (Tonioli) and Motsi (Mabuse) up doing the conga… Oh my goodness!” Bushell added.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had the time of my life,” he said.</p>
