      <h1>Deposition transcript for deputy assistant defense secretary released</h1>
      <h2>Only Pentagon witness to testify so far</h2>

      <p>WASHINGTON (CNN) - House impeachment investigators on Monday <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/11/politics/read-laura-cooper-testimony/index.html">released the deposition transcript </a>of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/22/politics/who-is-laura-cooper/index.html">Laura Cooper</a>, the deputy assistant defense secretary for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.</p>
      <p>Cooper has been the only Pentagon witness to testify so far as part of the House Democratic impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump and Ukraine. According to lawmakers, she provided a technical readout of how foreign aid was disbursed, and her closed-door testimony helped show how the freezing of US aid to Ukraine deviated from that normal process.</p>
      <p>Cooper, who was issued a subpoena for her testimony, did not give an opening statement, lawmakers said.</p>
      <p>She testified the day that a group of House Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/23/politics/republicans-storm-impeachment-inquiry-deposition-laura-cooper/index.html">barged into the House Intelligence Committee secure spaces </a>to protest the Democratic-run impeachment inquiry. The stunt, which was led by GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, delayed her deposition for five hours.</p>
