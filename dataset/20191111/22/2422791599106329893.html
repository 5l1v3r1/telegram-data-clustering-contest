      <p>ROCKPORT, Mass. - A Massachusetts college student has received a response to a message he threw into the ocean when he was 10 years old.</p>
      <p>Suffolk University sophomore Max Vredenburgh says he put the letter into a glass wine bottle that he threw into the water at Long Beach in Rockport in August 2010.</p>
      <p>Vredenburgh's father texted him Friday to say that he had received a letter from someone named "G. Dubois" who found the bottle on a beach in Southern France on Oct. 10.</p>
      <p>In Vrendenburgh's original letter he listed some of his favourite things including apples, the beach and outer space. He also asked that the letter's recipient "please write back."</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old Vredenburgh posted photos of the letters to his Twitter account Friday.</p>
