        <b>The man who oversees complaints about politicians in Wales has resigned after he was secretly recorded by an assembly member.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Standards commissioner Sir Roderick Evans said "highly confidential conversations" with his staff had been taped.</p>
      <p>The former Plaid Cymru AM Neil McEvoy has confirmed he made the recordings.</p>
      <p>Police are being asked to investigate and the assembly has arranged a sweep of the organisation's estate.</p>
      <p>The South Wales Central AM, who now sits as an independent, alleged he had found evidence that he claims had brought Sir Roderick's office into disrepute.</p>
      <p>He said he had acted lawfully and in the public interest. He had been facing three separate investigations by the standards commissioner at the time, before Sir Roderick resigned.</p>
      <p>Sir Roderick, a former high court judge and pro-chancellor of Swansea University, said Mr McEvoy's actions were "wholly unacceptable" as he stood down on Monday.</p>

      <p>"It has come to my attention that conversations with my staff about a variety of highly confidential and sensitive matters have been secretly, and possibly illegally, recorded over a period of what seems to be several months and in what seems to be a number of different locations by an assembly member," said Sir Roderick, who had served as the assembly's standards commissioner since 2017.</p>
      <p>"These have included highly confidential conversations with my staff including references to cases brought by members of the public.</p>
      <p>"That a member of our national assembly could behave in this way is wholly unacceptable. It undermines the integrity of the complaints procedure and brings our democratic process into disrepute.</p>
      <p>"I'm not prepared to continue in my role as standards commissioner."</p>

      <p>Welsh Assembly presiding officer Elin Jones said she had accepted Sir Roderick's resignation, and the process to find a successor will now begin.</p>
      <p>She said: "Covert recording of private conversations is a serious matter and we will be asking South Wales Police to investigate how such recordings were obtained.</p>
      <p>"Arrangements have been made for a sweep of the Senedd estate to locate any unauthorised electronic surveillance devices."</p>
      <p>In response to Mr McEvoy, the standards commissioner's office said: "The appropriateness of covert recordings of private and confidential conversations will be considered by the relevant authorities in due course."</p>
      <p>Sir Roderick was embroiled in a row last year after he said a video featuring a Labour AM's face superimposed on a woman in a low-cut top was not sexist.</p>
      <p>Earlier in 2019 he was accused of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-49754059">double standards after he recommended a Plaid Cymru AM Leanne Wood be reprimanded for a swear word in a tweet</a>.</p>
