      <p>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- A man in Florida is suing Madonna because of the delayed start time of an upcoming concert.</p>
      <p>Madonna fan, Nate Hollander, said he spent over $1,000 back in August for the Madame X Tour performance in Miami Beach, Fla. scheduled for December 17.</p>
      <p>Hollander said in October, he was then told the concert would now start two hours later than the time listed on the tickets.</p>
      <p>The concert was originally scheduled to begin at 8:30 p.m. but has now been moved to 10:30 p.m., according to Ticketmaster</p>
      <p>In his lawsuit, Hollander said that's too late and the new time is "a breach of contract."</p>
      <p>He said no refund has been offered for the time difference.</p>
      <p>Madonna and her team have not responded to requests for a comment on the matter at this time.</p>
      <p>The singer has been known to push back the start times of her shows.</p>
      <p>Last month, some concertgoers said a few of her Madame X performances in Chicago didn't end until 1:30 a.m.</p>
