      <p>BOROUGH PARK, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police are investigating a string of egg-throwing incidents in one area of Brooklyn over the weekend, and it is possible they may be hate crimes.</p>
      <p>They all happened in Borough Park, and the NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force has been notified.</p>
      <p>Authorities say the first incident involved a male who threw an egg at a 38-year-old woman walking her four children in front of 1442 38th Street just after 6 p.m. Saturday. Not all of the children were struck, but the mother, who didn't want to be identified, said it doesn't mean it's less traumatic for her children.</p>
      <p>"They had eggs thrown at them," said the mother whose children were crying after the incident. "We're being laughed at, they felt. And then they just ran home."</p>
      <p>The suspect fled the scene in an unknown direction.</p>
      <p>Around 10 minutes later, police say an unidentified male threw eggs at Sanz Synagogue, located on 369 Dahill Road, striking the inside wall of the synagogue as the door opened.</p>
      <p>The suspect, who is described as a light-skinned male and who was last seen wearing a dark-colored coat and blue jeans, fled the scene and no injuries were reported.</p>

      <p>The third incident occurred on Sunday just after 4 p.m. on 38th Street near 15th Avenue, where police say three male teens ran up to a 50-year-old woman who was walking with a child and struck her in the back with the eggs.</p>
      <p>"I think it's anti-Semitic and think it's racist," the unidentified mother said. "I think Jews are specifically targeted."</p>
      <p>The suspects fled the scene, and the female victim refused medical attention.</p>
