      <h1>'Thank you for your interest': Nikki Haley rebuffs Sebastian Gorka's claim she never told Trump about cabinet 'subversion'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:36:25+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:36</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley maintained she informed President Trump that his former chief of staff John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were trying to undermine his presidency.</p>
      <p>Sebastian Gorka, the former deputy assistant to the president, questioned why Haley had not told Trump about the cabinet members' plans after the South Carolina Republican had accused Kelly and Tillerson of scheming against Trump. "And why didn’t @NikkiHaley tell the President about Tillerson and Kelly’s subversion?" Gorka said Monday on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"I did. Thank you for your interest," Haley responded to Gorka's tweet. The former governor of South Carolina claimed in her new book that her <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/it-was-offensive-nikki-haley-claims-john-kelly-and-rex-tillerson-had-a-sidebar-plan-to-undermine-trump">former colleagues had tried</a> to recruit her to "save the country."</p>

      <p>"Kelly and Tillerson confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren’t being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country," Haley wrote. She followed up that comment in a <i>CBS Sunday Morning</i> interview where she accused the two of having a "sidebar plan" to "undermine" Trump.</p>
      <p>"Instead of saying that to me, they should have been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan. It should have been, go tell the president what your differences are, and quit if you don’t like what he’s doing," she said. "It was offensive."</p>
