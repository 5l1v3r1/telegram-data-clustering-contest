      <h1>The <i>You</i> Season Two Teaser Offers a Creepy Conclusion to 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:20:46+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p>Once all the gifts are unwrapped and your Christmas festivities come to an end, you can combat those postholiday blues with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/12/you-season-2-lifetime-netflix.html">Netflix’s most compelling</a> stalker. Happy holidays to all! The first teaser dropped today for season two of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/how-does-you-netflix-end-ending-explained.html"><i>You</i></a>, and even though it only gives us quick looks at Joe (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/you-penn-badgley-creepy-dreamboat.html">Penn Badgley</a>), his new “special friend” Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti), and a few other supporting characters, it also gives us a date: December 26. That’s when you can start watching Joe have new adventures in Los Angeles, a place that really embodies everything he didn’t like about <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/you-season-1-finale-elizabeth-lail-beck.html">Beck</a> in season one, but we’re sure to find some things about the city that he enjoys. (Badgley previously <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-you-season-2-release-date-was-just-announced-with-a-creepy-teaser-19313131">told <i>ET</i> that</a> “there are some things I’ve done with prosthetic bodies in this season that were kind of nauseating as I did them, I will say that,” about season two, and we already know he still loves murder.) We miss you already, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/you-netflix-peach-salinger-appreciation.html">Peach Salinger</a>.</p>
