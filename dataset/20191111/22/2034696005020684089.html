      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/tool">Tool</a> have added a new run of North American tour dates in early 2020.</p>
      <p>The new dates join a current run of tour dates behind <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/tool-fear-inoculum-review">their new album ‘Fear Inoculum’</a> which run through November.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The band are on tour until November 25, and will hit the road again on January 10, beginning the run with two shows in San Diego, California before the tour finishes up on February 1 in New Orleans.</p>
      <p>‘Fear Inoculum’, the band’s first album in 13 years, was described by <i>NME</i>‘s James McMahon as “a languid and blissful work – one that will richly reward future listens” in <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/tool-fear-inoculum-review">a five-star review</a>.</p>
      <p>“As with releases previous, there are wrinkles that will only emerge after the record is lived with and absorbed. But if you’re wondering whether ‘Fear Inoculum’ was worth the wait, then the answer is yes. If you’re wondering whether it’ll touch your heart, soul and spirt, the answer is also so.”</p>
