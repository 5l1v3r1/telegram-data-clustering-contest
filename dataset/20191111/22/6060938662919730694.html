      <p>NEW DELHI: With India becoming one of the biggest e-waste producers in the world, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/The-Times-Group">Times Group</a> has partnered with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Croma">Croma</a>, one of the largest multi-brand electronic retail stores in the country, to launch the third edition of Times <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Power-of-Print">Power of Print</a> to drive responsible disposal of e-waste.</p>
      <p>Times Power of Print is a unique initiative by the Times Group, the publisher of this newspaper, to invite creative teams across agencies to build an impactful print campaign from a real brief to make it work for a company or brand. The objective of the campaign will be ‘Consciously identify items of e-waste lying around in homes and flush them out’.</p>
      <p>“We are in our third year of Power of Print, an initiative that has become synonymous with driving the creation of compelling print campaigns that make a change. We are very excited to work with Croma this year on this thought leadership programme. The brief could not have been more appropriate in this age of excess technology consumption,” said Sivakumar Sundaram, president - revenue at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/BCCL">BCCL</a>.</p>
      <p>India generates around two million tonnes of e-waste annually and has been ranked fifth globally as one of its largest producers after US, China, Japan and Germany, according to the Global E-Waste Monitor. While e-waste production in India is growing annually at 10%, only a minuscule portion of it is recycled, revealed industry estimates.</p>
      <p>“E-waste is a growing hazard not only in our country, but worldwide. There is increased awareness on preventing e-wastage both in the physical space as well as mind space. The changing mindset and behaviour resonates well with our plan under the Power of Print initiative as there is no better medium than print to help consumers meet their changing priorities,” said Sundaram.</p>
      <p>The creative team that wins will see its campaign released in the pages of Times Group publications by Croma, which has a multi-crore budget for this initiative. The retail chain that runs 134 stores across 32 cities of India wants customers to stop hoarding old electronics.</p>
      <p>“As part of Croma’s mission statement, we have been trying to promote responsible consumption since last three years, however with little success. After attempting all the tricks of the trade — coaxing, pleading, bribing, it’s only a small audience that we have been able to influence. Using one of the leading newspapers of the country and the budding creative minds of the nation, we hope to envision a compelling creative campaign that promotes more and more people to join Croma in its endeavour towards a brighter tomorrow,” said Ritesh Ghosal, CMO at Croma.</p>
      <p>With the last two editions having seen participation from more than 400 agencies, this year’s competition will also see a student version added, as youngsters can be influential change agents. The winning team will get a fully paid trip for two team members to Cannes Lions and win the Power of Print trophy at the awards night. The contest is open to all communication agencies and students, including creative, media, digital and PR.</p>
      <p>The entries will be judged by a jury comprising of Ashish Chakravarty, Ashish Khazanchi, Garima Khandelwal, Harshad Rajadhyaksha, Hemant Shringy, Ritesh Ghosal, Santosh Padhi, Tista Sen and Sandipan Bhattacharya. Power of Print will be launched in the week of November 11, 2019 and culminate in the week of January 10, 2020 in Mumbai.</p>
