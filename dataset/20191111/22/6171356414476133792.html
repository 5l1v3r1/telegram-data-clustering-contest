      <h1>WeWork reportedly in talks to snatch John Legere from T-Mobile for CEO position</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:09:37+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/david-oh/" target="_blank">David Oh</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a>'s boisterous and pugnacious CEO John Legere is in the news again, and this time, it's not for calling Verizon and AT&amp;T "<a href="https://youtu.be/W4x37VAfkRY?t=154">dumb and dumber</a>" or <a href="https://youtu.be/4NW3AAkI9pU?t=30">cursing up a storm</a> at some event. According to the Wall Street Journal, John Legere has been singled out as a possible pick for the top CEO position at <a href="https://www.wework.com/">WeWork</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wework.com/">WeWork</a>, the shared-workspace company, has not been doing so well, and when you look at its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2EVZO3XH8">business model</a>, it makes sense why. As of June, WeWork has accumulated $47 billion in lease obligations with only $3.4 billion coming in from its clients. Compounding the matter is the length of time it takes before a space becomes ready, decreasing occupancy rate due to economic uncertainty, and a business model that can be easily replicated by competitors.</p>
      <p>Besides this bleak financial outlook, WeWork is also undergoing personnel issues â€” co-founder leaving the company, an unusual situation of two co-CEOs in place, and the lack of a clear successor.</p>
      <p>So how does John Legere fit in all of this? WeWork is hoping that Mr. Legere's experience in "fixing" companies, and his current <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/26/t-mobile-q2-earnings/">stellar performance</a> leading T-Mobile, will result in a turnaround for the company. Since he took the helms at T-Mobile, he raised the company's share price by 240% and overtook Sprint to claim the number three spot among the national wireless carriers.</p>
      <p>The speculation of Mr. Legere's departure for WeWork has resulted in share prices dropping for both T-Mobile (2%) and Sprint (2.8%). This rumor also raises new questions about the viability of the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/07/26/department-of-justice-gives-t-mobile-and-sprint-its-blessing-for-upcoming-merger/">T-Mobile and Sprint merger</a> that is still underway.</p>
      <p>According to the Wall Street Journal, WeWork is looking for a new leader to start as early as January, and talks are supposedly underway with Mr. Legere. Should John Legere depart T-Mobile for WeWork, the move will surely disappoint the legions of T-Mobile fans out there.</p>
