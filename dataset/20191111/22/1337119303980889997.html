      <p>Nintendo’s original Entertainment System (NES) is now 34 years old. A millennial, in other words. And since the console debuted in North America in the fall of 1985, its design — the familiar boxy shape; that matte gray, black, and red — has been an inspiration to nerds everywhere. The latest entry into this venerable canon, which includes everything from (fly as hell) <a href="https://freakersneaks.com/portfolio-item/jordan-nes-iv/">Jordans</a> to <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F567438332%2Fnintendo-nes-controller-inspired-display%3Fgpla%3D1%26gao%3D1%26%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping_us_a-home_and_living-storage_and_organization-shelving%26utm_custom1%3D975e8819-7d66-421b-ad5a-5e25321fae6b%26utm_content%3Dgo_1843970809_72389329649_346364690049_aud-301856855998%3Apla-302897469776_c__567438332%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiAqqTuBRBAEiwA7B66hTgcpttde-DQ9jTVbbc99GfFAbt8CEk9G8ixEyXd1OKTEdg3bcZAUxoCrQcQAvD_BwE&amp;referrer=theverge.com">shelving</a>, is <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-n30-24g-wireless-mouse">the 8BitDo N30</a>: a 2.4GHz wireless mouse made by the mad scientists over at 8BitDo. You can order one right now for $24.99.</p>
      <p>8BitDo is probably best known for its high-end controllers and gaming peripherals. A mouse isn’t totally out of their wheelhouse, though it is a little odd. I mean, look at it.</p>

      <p>The design is the brainchild of Swedish industrial designer Daniel Jansson, whose <a href="http://switchandlever.com/works/nes-mouse/">original foam model</a> was covered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009/04/30/nes-gamepad-mouse-is-the-most-amazing-piece-of-industrial-design/">breathlessly</a> by tech blogs way back in 2009. This year, 8BitDo partnered with Jansson to bring it to life.</p>
      <p>The mouse features a 3D touch panel between the buttons for scrolling, and the D-pad on the side is for navigating websites — page forward and backward the same way you move Mario in <i>Super Mario Bros</i>. What’s more: 8BitDo says that a single AA battery will give you 100-120 hours of use. That should be more than enough time to, I don’t know, go dust off your old NES and finally beat the original <i>Legend of Zelda</i>.</p>
