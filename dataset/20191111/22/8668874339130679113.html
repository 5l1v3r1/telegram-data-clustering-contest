      <p>Warren Gatland has revealed he was offered to apply for the head coach job at the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> but turned down the chance to replace Steve Hansen due to his loyalty to the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> and Lions.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach will take the reins as the Chiefs head coach next season in the first year of a contract that will see him with the club until the end of 2023.</p>
      <p>However, he will take time away from the team in 2021 to coach the British and Irish Lions, before returning to the helm.</p>

      <p>New Zealand Rugby chairman Brent Impey said last week that 26 top <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> coaches had been approached to apply for the All Blacks head coach role.</p>
      <p>Gatland has told the Radio Sport Breakfast he had to say no to New Zealand Rugby.</p>
      <p>“I was contacted about that…it was nice to be contacted I politely declined putting my name forward,” Gatland said this morning.</p>
      <p>“I’m a little bit old school…I’d made the commitment to the Chiefs and I’d made the commitment to the Lions, it was important that I carry on with that…honour the commitment I made to those two sides.</p>
      <p>“Maybe sometime in the future I may get that opportunity again,” he added.</p>

      <p>Gatland said if the chance to coach the All Blacks never arose again, he wouldn’t have any regrets.</p>
      <p>“No it’s not something I think about,” he told the <i>Radio Sport Breakfast</i>.</p>
      <p>“I’m not one of those people who plan ahead too much…I’m a great believer in what will be will be. For me having been away a long time there are a lot of different challenges and the challenges are to kind re-integrate myself back into New Zeland rugby.</p>
      <p>“If you are successful other opportunities will come along. It was time for me to make a decision to leave Wales and the northern hemisphere and come back to New Zealand and I’m excited by that,” Gatland said.</p>
