      <p>NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s capital is engulfed in a thick haze, plummeting air quality levels to “severe” category after a brief respite.</p>
      <p>The state-run Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index for Delhi on Tuesday crossed 400, about eight times the recommended maximum.</p>
      <p>The pollution crisis affecting 20 million residents is piling public pressure on the government to tackle the root causes of the persistent haze.</p>
      <p>Air pollution in Delhi and northern Indian states peaks in the winter due to farm fires and changes in wind direction.</p>
      <p>World Health Organization data released last year gave India the dubious distinction of having the world’s 10 most polluted cities.</p>
