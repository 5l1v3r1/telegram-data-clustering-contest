      <h1>Trump impeachment inquiry is like 'microwaved leftovers' from the Russia investigation, Jesse Watters says</h1>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump impeachment inquiry</a>, as it is being handled by the Democrats, seems more like "leftovers" from the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/news-events/russia-investigation">Russia investigation</a> than it does a serious scandal, according to Jesse Watters.</p>
      <p>In addition, Democrats seeking impeachment are not treating the process in a fair manner, Watters claimed Monday on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">The Five.</a>"</p>
      <p>"This whole scandal feels microwaved to me," he said.</p>
      <p>"It feels like Russia was hot and this just feels like a bunch of leftovers."</p>

      <p>Watters said Republicans put forward a serious witness list for House Intelligence Committee Chairman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a>, D-Calif. -- but doubted Schiff would allow many of those individuals to testify.</p>
      <p>He commended lawmakers for mentioning the name of Alexandra Chalupa, a Democratic National Committee (DNC) contractor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-embassy-dnc-operative-trump-dirt-2016">whom a Ukrainian embassy official</a> had claimed reached out for dirt on then-candidate Trump in 2016.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-embassy-dnc-operative-trump-dirt-2016">Earlier this year</a>, Ambassador Valeriy Chaly said Chalupa pushed for Ukraine's then-President Petro Poroshenko to mention Paul Manafort's ties to Ukraine publicly during a visit to the U.S., and sought detailed financial information on his dealings in the country, <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/441892-ukrainian-embassy-confirms-dnc-contractor-solicited-trump-dirt-in-2016">The Hill reported.</a> At the time, Manafort was President Trump's campaign chairman.</p>
      <p>On "The Five," Watters added that Hunter Biden was key to the impeachment effort on both sides of the argument, though Democrats including Schiff have resisted calls for him to testify.</p>
      <p>"I love how Hunter Biden is 'irrelevant.' Hunter Biden is at the center of this whole Venn diagram -- You take Hunter Biden out of here, there is no story," he added.</p>
      <p>"So, of course they'll rig it and they won't let him testify."</p>
      <p>The "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/watters-world">Watters World</a>" host said that Trump ultimately provided Ukraine with the defense aid before the Sept. 30 deadline, and that Kiev never opened an investigation into Biden or his father -- the former vice president and current 2020 presidential contender.</p>

      <p>"We give our ally aid and Joe Biden is not investigated -- remember that -- they get the aid -- and we get nothing in return," he said, referencing critics' refrain there was an alleged "quid pro quo" afoot.</p>
      <p>"The Democrats want that to be an impeachable offense? Good luck with that."</p>
