      <h2>Southgate believes that the quality of the players England had in the 1990s and the Golden Generation are superior to the ones they have today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T22:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has claimed that none of his current squad would get into <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England’s</a> best ever XI.</p>
      <p>Southgate’s men will host the landmark 1,000th England international against Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday and legends like Peter Shilton, David Beckham, Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Sir Geoff Hurst have all been invited as guests of honour.</p>
      <p>But Southgate, who won 57 caps, insisted that the great players he played with during the 1990s and the Golden Generation would get into the current team despite England reaching the World Cup semi final last year.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane is now England captain and on course to break goalscoring records while Raheem Sterling is regarded as world class.</p>
      <p>But when Southgate was asked to name the best England XI of players he played with, the England boss replied: “Not a chance, not a chance, most of them would get into the team we’ve got now, that’s for certain.</p>

      <p>“These are the debates that you don’t want to get involved in. I’ve played with some of the greats of the last 25 years. If you looked at [David] Beckham, [Paul] Scholes, [Steven] Gerrard, [Frank] Lampard, [Wayne] Rooney, Gazza [Paul Gascoigne], it was hard enough to get four into a midfield that time, wasn’t it, without going through the other generations of players.</p>
      <p>“It was a privilege to play with some outstanding players. For all of them, it meant so much. I can honestly say, whatever the reaction to the team was about, ‘they didn’t achieve’ or the various different teams.</p>
      <p>“But when you’re in the dressing room with them and you’re with them for weeks away, you knew what it meant to all of them to play for England and to represent England on those big nights.</p>

      <p>“Although it didn’t happen, it wasn’t because they didn’t want it, it was just that, for various reasons which we’ve talked about over the years, it didn’t.</p>
      <p>“But, their pride in that- the Ashley Coles, the Frank Lampards - you don’t get 60, 70, 80 caps by pulling out every time.</p>
      <p>“That’s the thing that pleases me the most now. When I started, I felt a lot of players were pulling out of squads. That wasn’t the case years ago and I don’t think it’s the case now.</p>
      <p>“We will have some pull-outs this week because we’ve picked some players who were struggling before we went into the weekend. But, for me, it’s a positive that we don’t have many that withdraw from games and that’s a good start point.”</p>
