      <p>MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has made an unspecified number of arrests over last week’s massacre of three women and six children of dual U.S-Mexican nationality in the north of the country, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“There have been arrests, but it’s not up to us to give information,” Durazo told reporters in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>The women and children from families of U.S. Mormon origin who settled in Mexico decades ago were killed last Monday on a remote dirt road in the state of Sonora by suspected drug cartel gunmen, sparking outrage and condemnation in the United States.</p>
      <p>Durazo said that prosecutors in Sonora, as well as at the federal level, were in charge of the investigation.</p>
      <p>However, a spokeswoman for the state government of Sonora said: “We don’t have that information.”</p>
      <p>Mexico’s government has said it believes the victims were caught in the midst of a territorial dispute between an arm of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and the rival Juarez Cartel.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Mexico’s government said it had asked the FBI to participate in the investigation into the killings.</p>
