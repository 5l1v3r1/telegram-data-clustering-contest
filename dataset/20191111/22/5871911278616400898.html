      <h1>Drake booed off stage at Tyler, The Creator's Camp Flog Gnaw festival (Video)</h1>

      <p>Rap fans in Los Angeles were none too pleased over the weekend, when they expected one performer to take the stage, only to be surprised by a different one.</p>
      <p>And they made sure to voice their opinions about it.</p>
      <p>The big rumor at Tyler, The Creator’s “Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival” in Los Angeles over the weekend was that Frank Ocean would be making a surprise guest appearance at one point.</p>
      <p>He didn’t, though.</p>
      <p>Instead, it was Drake who took the stage, and he was met by a barrage of boos, which were followed by “We want Frank!” chants.</p>

      <p>The sense of entitlement there was strong, that’s for sure.</p>
