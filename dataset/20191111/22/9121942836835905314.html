      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Rudy Gobert had 25 points and 14 rebounds as the Utah Jazz beat the Golden State Warriors 122-108 on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Donovan Mitchell added 23 points and Mike Conley scored 22 for Utah, which improved to 7-3.</p>
      <p>The injury-ravaged Warriors fell to an NBA-worst 2-9 and their frustrations boiled over in the fourth quarter. Draymond Green, back after missing five games with a torn finger ligament, earned back-to-back technicals and an ejection for arguing a blocking call with 8:28 left.</p>
      <p>Less than a minute later, coach Steve Kerr was given a technical after arguing a kicked-ball call against Jordan Poole.</p>
      <p>It’s been that kind of season so far for the Warriors, who had their biggest star back in the building Monday.</p>
      <p>Stephen Curry, sidelined for at least the next three months because of a broken left hand, held a pregame media briefing to discuss his injury and try to lend his teammates some moral support.</p>

      <p>Point guard D’Angelo Russell continues to be a bright spot for Golden State. He scored 33 points, his fourth consecutive game of 30 or more.</p>
      <p>The Jazz pulled away thanks to their 3-point shooting and a huge advantage at the free throw line. Utah shot 46 percent (16 for 35) from beyond the arc and went 26 of 32 at the foul line.</p>
      <p>Utah took a 69-54 lead into halftime after going 9 for 18 on 3s. Mitchell led the way, shooting 5 of 6 from long range and scoring 19 points.</p>
      <p>The Jazz made 16 of 17 foul shots in the first half, while Golden State attempted just four free throws.</p>
      <p>Russell got off to a terrific start, scoring 18 points in the first quarter and going into the break with 22.</p>
      <p>Besides getting Green back in the lineup, the Warriors also welcomed back rookie forward Eric Paschall, who missed Saturday’s game at Oklahoma City with a bruised hip.</p>
      <p>Advertising</p>
      <p>Paschall, who averaged 22.5 points in the four games leading up to his injury, finished with eight.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Jazz: Entered the night with the NBA’s 28th-ranked offense at 101 points per game. They surpassed that number by 21 points against Golden State. … Utah, which is 5-0 at home, improved to 2-3 on the road.</p>
      <p>Warriors: Green’s return to the lineup was a welcome sign, but his presence was felt even before the opening tip. “We already felt it this morning in shootaround, just his voice,” Kerr said.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Jazz: Host the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Warriors: At the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday night.</p>
