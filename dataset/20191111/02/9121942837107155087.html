      <p>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — The U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia has described the release from house arrest of opposition co-leader Kem Sokha as a step forward and says further moves toward full multiparty democracy will improve relations with the United States.</p>
      <p>Ambassador Patrick Murphy spoke after a meeting Monday with the banned Cambodia National Rescue Party’s Kem Sokha, who was arrested in September 2017 on a charge of treason for meeting with an American democracy promotion organization. His arrest led to his party being disbanded.</p>
      <p>He was freed Sunday by court order after more than two years in detention without trial. He remains charged with some restrictions on his movement.</p>
      <p>The court granted him freedom a day after the party’s other leader, Sam Rainsy, couldn’t fulfill his vow to return from exile to Cambodia.</p>
