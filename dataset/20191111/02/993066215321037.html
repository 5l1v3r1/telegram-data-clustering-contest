      <p>The director of the film, which premieres new unreleased material by Michael, saw the funny side when it was given a one-star review.</p>

      <p>“Can our one star at least be a really, really big star?”</p>
      <p>The UK premiere of the film, due out on November 15, takes place at BFI Southbank.</p>
