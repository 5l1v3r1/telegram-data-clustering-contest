      <p><b>HANSON, Mass.</b> - A balloon travels from Louisville, Ky. and lands in a couple's backyard here in Hanson, Mass. But the story behind this special balloon has now connected two couples from different parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Jack and Nancy Glynn found a bright orange balloon stuck underneath their stairs at their home in Hanson after a storm.</p>
      <p>"And then when I opened it up, I realized it had writing on it," said Nancy. "So I was just like, this is amazing."</p>
      <p>They noticed a birthday message with the name of a couple.</p>
      <p>"I'm like look at this, I would love to find out where it came from, and I'm thinking like somewhere next door or the next town over," Nancy said.</p>
      <p>But they quickly learned that the balloon traveled much, much farther. After googling the names on the balloon, the Glynns found a wedding website for the couple and a phone number.</p>
      <p>"I blindly texted the person and I just texted the picture and said, 'would this by any chance belong to you?'" said Jack.</p>
      <p>Kurron Carmichael answered Glynn's text right away. He says his family releases balloons on his grandmother's birthday in October every year since she died in 2013.</p>
      <p>"So this year me and my fiancé had just gotten married the day before her birthday, so we were in Mexico on our honeymoon, and my parents wrote, 'from Kurron and your granddaughter-in-law Chelsea,' and they released the balloons," said Carmichael.</p>
      <p>Carmichael was shocked to learn that balloon traveled from his home of Louisville, Ky. all the way to Hanson, Mass. He can't help but think his grandmother had something to do with it.</p>
      <p>"It's her, as crazy as it sounds," he said. "It's something she would do, she would make it through anything, so for her to make it 1000 miles away for someone to find it, it's just a sign."</p>
      <p>A sign from above that Glynn hopes was meant to connect him and his wife to this couple across the country. The Glynns are now mailing the balloon back to the Carmichaels, and plan to keep in touch.</p>
      <p>"For me, I kind of believe things happen for a reason, even if we aren't aware why it happens," Jack said.</p>
