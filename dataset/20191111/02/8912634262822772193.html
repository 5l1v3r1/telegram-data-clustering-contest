      <p>The winners of this year’s MENA Effie Awards have been announced during an awards ceremony that took place on Nov. 6 at the Coca-Cola Arena Dubai. Two thousand marketing and advertising professionals gathered to celebrate the best marketing in the Middle East.<br/>This year’s expert panel of judges was tasked with assessing a total of 275 shortlisted entries across 35 categories, against a backdrop of mounting competition in the marketing industry.<br/>Alexandre Hawari, CEO of Mediaquest, the organizer of the MENA Effie Awards, said: “The year 2019 saw tighter budgets, increasing pressure to deliver revenue and growing competition in the industry, but despite this high-pressure environment, marketing professionals have upped the ante with new levels of innovation, creativity and resourcefulness. This is what we look for in our award winners, who have all successfully faced the challenges by finding ever more strategic and targeted ways to reach audiences and deliver a solid return on investment.”<br/>Winning an Effie has become a global symbol of achievement. This year’s prestigious “Grand Prix” went to J. Walter Thompson for the “The Roaming Puppet” campaign it developed for Saudi Telecom Company. Other top accolades included “Marketer of the Year” for Ozge Zoralioglu, chief marketing officer of Yum! Brands — KFC MENAPAKT; “Most Effective Advertising Agency Office of the Year” for FP7 McCann Dubai; “Most Effective Media Agency Offices of the Year” for PHD UAE and UM Saudi Arabia; and “Most Effective Agency Network of the Year” for FP7 McCann.</p>
