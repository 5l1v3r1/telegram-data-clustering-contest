      <p>Argentine Primera Division club Estudiantes returned to the site of their former stadium with a jaw-dropping light show that featured a giant lion strutting across the stadium roof.</p>
      <p>Stunning footage from the weekend shows an enormous lion leap through a portal and walk from one end of the stadium to the other as the audience cheers loudly.</p>
      <p>The occasion <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/watch-argentinian-side-estudiantes-jaw-20856544">marked</a> the Estudiantes return to the Estadio Jorge Luis Hirschi ground they vacated 14 years ago. The site first closed three years earlier due to safety concerns and renovations began in 2008.</p>
      <p>The new multipurpose stadium, Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, is run by former Manchester United star Juan Sebastian Veron, a legendary player for Argentina's national team and the club, who led them to the Champions League of Latin American football in 2009.</p>
