      <p>Cliftonville 4 - Warrenpoint 0</p>
      <p>The Reds made it six-in-a-row in the Irish League with victory over basement side Warrenpoint.</p>
      <p>Barry Gray recently took charge of the beleaguered ‘Point and was making a professional return to Solitude after his time in charge of Cliftonville last year.</p>
      <p>It was a miserable return for Gray as his Warrenpoint side were easily cast aside.</p>
      <p>Mark McKee, Conor McDermott, Joe Gormley, and Ryan Curran all got in on goal scoring action.</p>
      <p>But it Conor McDermott's effort was the pick of the bunch. He nonchalantly lifted the ball over the head of an onrushing ‘Point player and then struck the ball in to the net from well inside his own half.</p>
      <p>Coleraine 4 - Glenavon 0</p>
      <p>Glenavon suffered a heavy defeat to league leaders Coleraine.</p>
      <p>Glenavon's hopes of a result were hit a devastating blow when Daniel Larmour seen red. The Lurgan side were trailing 1-0 when Larmour received a straight red and went on to ship a further three.</p>
      <p>Coleraine have now gone 36 home games unbeaten in the league, a run which stretches back to April 2017.</p>
      <p>Coleraine are undefeated in their last eight in all competitions, winning six on the trot in the league.</p>
      <p>Ballymena 1 - Carrick Rangers 2</p>
      <p>David Jeffrey's men have gone six league games without a win following defeat to Carrick Rangers.</p>
      <p>Daniel Kelly gave Carrick a lead in the opening minute, but Aaron Burns restored parity for Ballymena on the 12th minute.</p>
      <p>Lee Chapman grabbed the winning goal in the 23rd minute to give Carrick Rangers their third win in five games.</p>
      <p>Niall Currie's men are now a single point behind Ballymena following Carrick's recent good run of form.</p>
      <p>Institute 1 – Glentoran 1</p>
      <p>Institute is now within striking distance of Glenavon following a draw against high-flying Glentoran.</p>
      <p>Elvio Van Overbeek opened the scoring for the Glens but Niall Grace grabbed the leveller just before the half-time break.</p>
      <p>The Glens were hoping to make it five wins on the bounce in the league but came unstuck against Sean Connor's men.</p>
      <p>The recently appointed Institute boss has galvanised the Derry club, who have picked up seven points in his short tenure so far.</p>
      <p>Larne vs Crusaders</p>
      <p>Crusaders will be hoping for a return to winning form with tonight's game against Larne.</p>
      <p>Stephen Baxter's men were flying high but are winless in their last four league outings.</p>
      <p>Larne results have been mixed as of late. However, Larne claimed an impressive 3-0 victory in their last outing against Ballymena and will be aiming to inflict similar pain on Crusaders tonight.</p>
