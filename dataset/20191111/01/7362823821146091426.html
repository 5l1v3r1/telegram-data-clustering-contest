      <h1>Mexico cartel ambush: American father whose relatives were killed says he's leaving the country</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T01:27:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 01:27</time> by <a rel="author">Bradford Betz</a></address>
      <p>An American father whose family members were killed in a brutal ambush attack in northern Mexico last week says he's leaving the country because "you don’t get justice too much in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/location-mexico">Mexico</a>."</p>
      <p>David Langford made the comments during an interview with ABC News' "<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/american-father-speaks-1st-time-deadly-mexican-ambush/story?id=66893435">World News Tonight</a>" that aired Sunday. Langford’s 43-year-old wife, Dawna, and two sons, Trevor, 11, and Rogan, 2, were among nine women and children killed in the Nov. 4 attack.</p>
      <p>"My whole life has turned upside down. Not only have I lost a wife and two children, but I'm having to move the rest of my family with really no place to go at this point," Langford said. "I believe in forgiveness, but I also believe in justice and forgiveness doesn't rob justice. You don't get justice too much in Mexico."</p>

      <p>Langford’s family members lived in La Mora, a community in the Mexican border state of Sonora.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 4, around 9:30 a.m., a group of armed man ambushed the family traveling to Galeana – about 100 miles from the Arizona border. The area has been disputed territory among <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/topic/mexican-cartel-violence">several cartels</a>, investigators said.</p>
      <p>The nine victims were members of three dual-citizen families. Investigators said the families’ large SUVs may have been mistaken for those of a rival gang.</p>
      <p>Langford’s 13-year-old son, Devin, was unharmed in the ambush. He walked about 14 miles to La Mora to seek help after hiding his injured siblings.</p>
      <p>"To be honest with you, my boy’s a hero simply because he gave his life for his brothers and sisters," Langford said.</p>

      <p>Much of the area has been seen as lawless, with people arranging for their own security since the 2009 killing of an anti-crime activist. Langford said that' why he's decided to leave.</p>

      <p>"It's not worth living in fear," he said.</p>
      <p>"The toughest part for me was saying goodbye... saying goodbye to two innocent lives that were cut short and a vibrant wife that lived a life to its fullest that had many friends and was loved by all, by everybody."</p>
