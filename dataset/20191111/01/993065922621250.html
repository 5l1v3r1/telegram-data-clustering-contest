      <p>AN INVITATION to dinner with my soul sisters on Halloween night – who could refuse? We are sisters under the skin. We like to rock our gipsy souls.</p>
      <p>“What are you going to do?” asked a friend in work who was mourning time passing as she took her youngest for what is probably his last year of trick or treating.</p>
      <p>“We’re having dinner in a cow byre – but it’s been converted – and then we’ll do a little soul searching around a big blazing fire,” I told her.</p>
      <p>“I want some of that,” she said.</p>
      <p>My sisters under the skin are women that I’ve grown to love over the years.</p>
      <p>We’ve shared yoga classes and dodgy hips and bad backs and a lot of snorted laughter when you’re hanging upside down.</p>
      <p>Some of us are veggie, some of us are vegan and some of us could murder a whopper. Some might stop off for a dirty big fry on the trip down to that retreat in the far end of Connemara where you cleanse your body with shots of wheatgrass and chocolate is a filthy word. Yes, you know who you are.</p>
      <p>Maybe we don’t see our soul sisters often, but they are always there, standing softly in the shadows.</p>
      <p>It was a dark and lonely drive into wilderness to get to our venue on Halloween. Country roads have that pitch black darkness that is bewitching. We rumbled up the lane and picked our way blindly out of the car and maybe that was part of the magic too.</p>
      <p>For without artificial light, you let instinct take over, and shapes loom out of the dark that is more grey than black and somewhere out there fox, badger, hedgehog, owl, stare into the soft silence.</p>
      <p>What awaited us was a converted, whitewashed barn where candles flickered and fairy lights dangled across an old farm yard. There was a glowing wood fire from a pizza oven. A cup of hot spiced apple punch was a welcome blessing.</p>
      <p>There was toasted barmbrack and tiny colcannon cakes, there were fresh-baked pizzas to die for – meaty, non-meaty and positively vegan. And there was a devilish tasty dark chocolate cake that was so rich that we wrapped up half to bring home for breakfast.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, we talked about Halloween and the thin veil between the worlds of the living and the dead.</p>
      <p>We talked about sorrows we might want to let go... nagging thoughts that waken you at 3am, that buzz like bluebottles around your head and send sleep like a small child slipping from your grasp to hurtle out of the door.</p>
      <p>We scribbled down hurts that had dogged the past year and threw our notes into the flames.</p>
      <p>You can’t beat a good burn. I come from a family of fire starters. My mother used to like nothing better than a big autumn bonfire of leaves and wood out the back. It was the kind of bonfire you’d want to dance around.</p>
      <p>There is something cleansing about putting your grief down on paper and watching the fire lick it up. Gone... all gone.</p>
      <p>We could all have got up and danced round that fire but we were weighed down with the best pizza ever and drowsy on root ginger tea.</p>
      <p>We also wrote down our hopes for the year to come. I tucked mine in my pocket and put the note away in a drawer... not to forget, but to unfold every so often and remind myself.</p>
      <p>Then it was back through the darkness of the farmyard and home through the fields watched by the ghostly guardians of trees.</p>
      <p>You need a tight band of sisters to hold you close when walls tumble down and your heart is shaken. The mothers at the school gates became lifelong friends who are there at the drop of a hat, who come bearing tea and soup and lasagne and comfort.</p>
      <p>My yoga mates are never far away. We bonded over dog-head down and deep breathing, laughed at our wonky struggles to do headstands and saw each other through life-changing times.</p>
      <p>Old friends are there when the road ahead seems way too dark and life ties a blindfold around your eyes, spins you about and leaves you dizzy and struggling.</p>
      <p>I keep a friend’s gift of rose quartz crystal in my pocket – a touchstone for tough times.</p>
      <p>“How was your soul sisters night?” someone asks.</p>
      <p>It was magic, I tell her.</p>
