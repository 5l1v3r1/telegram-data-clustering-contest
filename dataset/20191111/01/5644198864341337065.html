      <p>HANGZHOU: Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Inc said on Monday that sales for its annual Singles' Day shopping blitz hit 84 billion yuan (US$12 billion) within the first hour, up 22 per cent from last year's early haul of 69 billion yuan.</p>
      <p>Akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States, Singles' Day has been promoted as a shopping fest by Alibaba Chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang since 2009, growing rapidly to become the world's biggest online sales event.</p>

        <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/singles-day-alibaba-online-shopping-discounts-taylor-swift-12075020">Commentary: Don’t get suckered by the hype of 11.11</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Also known as "Double Eleven", the festival's name originates from the calendar date 11/11, with the four ones referencing being single.</p>
      <p>Alibaba saw sales worth US$30 billion on its platforms on Singles' Day last year, dwarfing US$7.9 billion US online sales for Cyber Monday. Yet the 27 per cent sales growth was the lowest in the event's 10-year history, spurring a search for fresh ideas.</p>

      <p>The US$486 billion Chinese retail juggernaut kicked off this year's 24-hour shopping fest with performances by American pop star Taylor Swift and local celebrities like Jackson Yee.</p>
      <p>Sales hit the US$1 billion mark in the first minute and eight seconds, Alibaba said. Singles' Day was among the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform on Monday morning, with users discussing what they spent on.</p>
      <p>Alibaba has said it expects over 500 million users to participate in the shopping festival this year, about 100 million more than last year.</p>
      <p>This is the first time Alibaba's Singles' Day does not have flamboyant co-founder Jack Ma at its helm, after he resigned in September as chairman.</p>
      <p>It also comes at a crucial time for the company, which is looking to raise up to US$15 billion via a share sale in Hong Kong this month.</p>
      <p>Alibaba continues to dominate the online shopping industry, but not without competition.</p>
      <p>In addition to longtime rival JD.com, it now faces competition from upstart Pinduoduo, which surged in popularity in 2017 by targeting consumers in China's lower-tier cities.</p>
