      <h1>Boy, 10, delivers chilling death threat in squalid camp filled with ISIS brides</h1>
      <h2>ISIS brides and their children are being kept in al Hol prison in north east Syria where Kurdish security forces are trying to keep control following the invasion of Turksh forces</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T01:29:57+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 01:29</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A camp filled with the children and brides of ISIS fighters has become a hot bed of radicalism and its own "mini caliphate".</p>
      <p>A staggering 70,000 people are locked up at the al Hol prison in north east Syria.</p>
      <p>The Kurdish fighters that guard them have been depleted by the recent invasion of Turkish forces, meaning violence has broken out behind the camp's single fence.</p>
      <p>Multiple people have been murdered and stabbings are common, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/islamic-state-new-mini-caliphate-forms-at-syrian-al-hol-camp-11858828">Sky News reported</a> .</p>
      <p>Children living in the terrifying environment appear to be deeply traumatised by the situation and the radical doctrines of their elders.</p>

      <p>One ten-year-old boy delivered a chilling threat straight into the camera lens of a journalist visiting the camp.</p>
      <p>"We're going to kill you by slaughtering you. We will slaughter you." he told a Sky News reporter.</p>
      <p>"God says, 'Turn to Allah with sincere repentance in the hope that your Lord will remove you from your ills.'"</p>

      <p>The camp is filled full of children and their mothers who were indoctrinated by the ISIS creed before the caliphate fell.</p>
      <p>News of the leader of the terror cult's leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, at the hands of US forces had filtered through to the prisoners.</p>
      <p>One woman from Paris expressed confidence that a new leader would take his place, while suggesting he had found his way to some kind of afterlife.</p>
      <p>Not far from al Hol are several prisons where adult male ISIS fighters are kept.</p>
      <p>The security of the prisons has come into question since Turkish forces invaded the country last month.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of ISIS brides escaped from another prison in Ain Issa close to the Turkish border, Kurdish forces have said.</p>
      <p>It was never the plan of coalition forces for woman and children to remain in al Hol as long as they have.</p>
      <p>As of yet no plans have been formed as to what to do with the people being kept there under the watch of guards with guns slung across their shoulders.</p>

      <p>Conditions are far from luxurious. Laundry hangs on washing lines hung between tents around which barefoot children run in the dirt.</p>
      <p>Mark Stone, of Sky News, suggested the squalid environment was the perfect breeding ground for extremism.</p>
      <p>He said: "The place is the perfect incubator for the reformation of IS. Essentially the camp already represents a new mini caliphate."</p>
