      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 11 — A New York financial regulator said Saturday it is investigating claims of gender discrimination by the new credit card from tech giant Apple and its issuer Goldman Sachs, after a cardholder’s tweet about his wife’s credit limit went viral.</p>
      <p>American businessman David Heinemeier Hansson had tweeted on Thursday that the Apple Card is a “f**king sexist program”.</p>
      <p>He said the card’s “black box” algorithm had given him 20 times the credit limit of his wife, even though they file joint tax returns and she has a higher credit score.</p>
      <p>Hansson tweeted a series of messages recounting fruitless chats with Apple customer service agents, who were unable to explain the disparity but blamed it on the algorithm that determines an applicant’s credit-worthiness.</p>
      <p>A “black box” algorithm refers to artificial intelligence systems whose decisions cannot be explained.</p>
      <p>In March, Apple started offering the Apple Card, issued by banking giant Goldman Sachs.</p>
      <p>New York state regulators will “be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex,” said a spokesman for Linda Lacewell, the superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services.</p>
      <p>“Any algorithm, that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class of people violates New York law.”</p>
      <p>Said Goldman spokesman Andrew Williams: “Our credit decisions are based on a customer’s creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.” — AFP</p>
