      <p>WOLVERHAMPTON: Ruben Neves and Raul Jimenez earned local bragging rights for Wolves with a dominant 2-1 win over Midlands rivals Aston Villa on Sunday (Nov 10).</p>
      <p>Midfielder Neves' first-half thunderbolt and Jimenez's late effort lifted Nuno Espirito Santo's side to eighth in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Trezeguet grabbed an injury-time consolation for Villa.</p>
      <p>It was Wolves' first top-flight win since their stunning success at Manchester City a month ago but they are now unbeaten in seven league matches and just one point behind the top five after inflicting a third straight Premier League defeat on Villa.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith's Villa, now only three points above the relegation zone, desperately missed injured skipper Jack Grealish as they fell to a limp defeat at Molineux.</p>
      <p>The hosts found a deserved breakthrough four minutes before the break.</p>
      <p>Tyrone Mings brought down Adama Traore on the right and Joao Moutinho squared his free-kick to Neves to crash in a low drive from 20 yards.</p>
      <p>Wolves pushed for a second after the break and Diogo Jota's drive was turned over by goalkeeper Orjan Nyland, on for the injured Jed Steer, after 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>Villa tried to exert some late pressure but their hopes were ended with six minutes left when Traore broke down the right and squared for Jimenez to roll in.</p>
      <p>Trezeguet's close-range drive, given by goal-line technology, in injury-time gave the scoreline a flattering look for Villa.</p>
