      <h1>Retailers are hoping for a Christmas miracle</h1>

      <p>The crucial Christmas trading season was once relished by high street bosses hoping to fatten their profits before the New Year.</p>
      <p>But so troubled is the sector that the once ‘Golden Quarter’ of retail has lost much of its shine, being viewed today by many executives as a way of raking in just enough cash to stave off collapse.</p>

      <p>Looking back at the year-to-date, it has largely been one of worsening conditions on the high street. Costs continue to mount, competitors continues to rise, and shoppers continue to hold back spending.</p>
      <p>The likes of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia, department store chain Debenhams and preppy fashion group Jack Wills have all turned to radical restructuring or fallen into administration.</p>
      <p>Now it looks as if card company Clintons is heading down a similar path, with reports on the weekend that 66 stores face closure.</p>
      <p>Even Mike Ashley, the man whose retail buying spree had at first seemed like a much-needed antidote to the high street crisis, said this summer that he regretted his rescue purchase of House of Fraser.</p>
      <p>Whether it is Next in fashion, Tesco in grocery or Greggs in food, there have all been welcome exceptions to the rule.</p>
      <p>Strong management teams with a fixation on cost-control and changing consumer trends can deliver solid results in uncertain times.</p>
      <p>But for many bricks-and-mortar stalwarts, the outlook is gloomy.</p>
      <p>Springboard insights director Diane Wehrle is forecasting that this Christmas will be slightly worse than last year’s for the retail sector: “Consumer confidence is still lower, spending is constrained in both bricks-and-mortar and online – there is no reason to suggest Christmas will be any more positive this year.”</p>
      <p>After the 12 December election, retailers have a two-week trading opportunity to claw back any sales they might have lost in previous weeks due to uncertainty.</p>
      <p>But if the weather is bad during that crucial fortnight, and people stay indoors rather than visit retail destinations, it could be a nail in the coffin for the most troubled chains. </p>

      <p>Springboard research published today with the British Retail Consortium underlines the challenge weather presents – a rainy Autumn this year helped drive a 3.2 per cent drop in annual footfall.</p>
      <p>There is also the problem of customer experience; with some of Britain’s biggest retailers slashing costs this year, they risk longer queues at tills as a result of reduced staff overheads.</p>
      <p>These headwinds leave the high street bracing itself for what could be its toughest ever golden quarter; they will be hoping their Christmas wishes of good weather and a welcome dose of political clarity can come to the rescue.</p>
