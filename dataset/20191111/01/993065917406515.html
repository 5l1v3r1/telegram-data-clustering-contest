      <h1>Naomh Eanna and Dungannon managers critical of late postponement</h1>

      <p>THE managers of Ulster intermediate hurling finalists, Naomh Eanna and Dungannon, were both criticial of the decision to postpone Saturday’s decider just over an hour before the scheduled throw-in time.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain rendered the Owenbeg pitch unplayable and referee Tarlach Conway made the decision at around 2.45pm, ahead of the 4pm start.</p>
      <p>The decider is to be re-fixed for this weekend, along with the Ulster Club JHC final between Eoghan Rua, Coleraine and Newry Shamrocks, which was also called off on Saturday due to the state of the pitch at the Dub. “If they could make an earlier decision, it would be handier for everyone involved, but it’s not the first time this has happened,” said Naomh Eanna manager Terence McNaughton.</p>
      <p>“The weather forecast was coming in there from early in the week, and we knew it was going to be a wild bad day.</p>
      <p>“If the pitch is bad on Thursday and it gets a full day of rain, chances are it’s not going to improve.</p>
      <p>“At what stage does a wee bit of common sense kick in?”</p>
      <p>Eoghan Ruadh boss Colm McGuinness echoed the thoughts of the former Allstar.</p>
      <p>“It’s unfortunate they weren’t able to make the decision before everybody travelled,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s very unsettling, to be honest, we travelled up, our supporters travelled up in buses and they called the match off an hour and a quarter before it was to start.”</p>
      <p>McGuinness also spoke of the inconvenience caused to players and supporters who travelled from abroad for the game.</p>
      <p>“I know that people had travelled over for the weekend just to go to the match, we have players working away and travelling. “We have one boy travelling from Frankfurt in Germany to train and play.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough for everyone involved, we had a physio travelled over from Scotland just for the day.”</p>
      <p>But the Dungannon manager accepted that the pitch had become potentially dangerous.</p>
      <p>“In fairness, the pitch was in a bad state, certain parts of it not playable, and the referee made the final decision. “We were happy enough to go out and play, I don’t think St Enda’s were.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day we respect the decision of the referee and the Ulster Council, there’s not much we can do about it.</p>
      <p>“Tarlach Conway is one of the best referees around, and he made the decision, and if he thinks it’s not playable, we respect his decision.”</p>
      <p>Ciaran McLaughlin of the Ulster Council said a spell of heavy rain in the early afternoon had seen the playing surface deteriorate to a dangerous extent.</p>
      <p>“We had a look at the pitch earlier on in the day, myself and the groundsman, and we were confident enough at that time, a round a quarter to one, that the game was going to go ahead, and the clubs were notified accordingly,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And then unfortunately there was a deluge of rain, which continued on for quite a period of time, which left the pitch, in the referee’s eyes, unplayable.</p>
      <p>“It’s unfortunate for the two clubs and for their supporters, on a massive day in both clubs’ year, and we do apologise for that side of it.</p>
      <p>“But what we want to do is make sure that player welfare is given top consideration. That was the most important consideration overall, and that’s why unfortunately the game had to be postponed.”</p>
