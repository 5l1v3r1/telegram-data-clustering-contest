      <p>Matiah Christensen hit eight-point and three-point bucks during the trip.</p>
      <p>“You had to see it to believe it,” <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/14-year-old-girl-kills-two-bucks-with-one-arrow/29747303">her father, John Christensen, told WISN</a>. “You can see how it happened. She got two bucks with a single shot, which makes that two more bucks than I’ve ever shot in my life.”</p>
      <p>A three-point buck passed by. About an hour later, it returned with the eight-point buck and a few does, WISN reported. Matiah drew her bow and fired.</p>
      <p>“We didn't know if I hit anything because they all ran in different directions,” <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/14-year-old-girl-kills-two-bucks-with-one-arrow/29747303">Matiah told WISN</a>. </p>
      <p>They followed the trails of blood and found the carcasses. The arrow went off the eight-point buck and then struck the three-point buck.</p>
      <p>Wildlife officials allowed her to keep the eight-point buck and the antlers from both. She plans to display them, as well as the arrow.</p>
      <p>“People are saying, like: 'You hit your peak pretty young. I don’t think you’re going to be able to top that,’” <a href="https://www.wisn.com/article/14-year-old-girl-kills-two-bucks-with-one-arrow/29747303">Matiah told WISN</a>. “But I’ll keep hunting.”</p>
