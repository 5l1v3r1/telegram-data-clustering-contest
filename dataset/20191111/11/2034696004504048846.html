      <p>They previously debuted another new track ‘No Cap’ over the summer but they didn’t play that track at the Houston event, which is <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/travis-scott-astroworld-review">named after Scott’s 2018 album.</a></p>
      <p>During the event, Scott also brought out <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> for <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-kanye-west-father-drive-atvs-new-follow-god-video-2566204">‘Follow God’</a>, his latest single from ‘Jesus Is King’<i>, </i>and ‘Can’t Tell Me Nothing’ from 2007’s ‘Graduation’. Others special guests on the night (November 9) were reportedly Roddy Ricch, Young Thug, and Gunna.</p>

      <p>Earlier over the weekend,  it was reported that three people were <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fans-injured-stampede-travis-scotts-astroworld-festival-2566336">hospitalised with minor leg injuries while trying to enter the festival</a>.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://abc13.com/fans-transported-to-hospital-after-possible-trampling-at-astroworld-hfd/5686133/">ABC13 Eyewitness News</a> </i>reported that fans were trampled before the gates officially opened at midday after the barricades were knocked over, allowing hundreds of fans to rush into the grounds at once.</p>
      <p>Scott himself shared fan footage of the moment fans began running to enter the event on his Instagram account, adding: “RAGERS SET TONE WHEN I COME OUT TONIGHT. BE SAFE RAGE HARD.</p>
      <p>The festival sold out weeks ago, despite the lineup — featuring <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/migos">Migos</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/pharrell-williams">Pharrell</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/marilyn-manson">Marilyn Manson</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/rosalia">Rosalia</a>, and more — just being announced on Friday (November 8). Many fans camped outside Houston’s NRG Park last night to try to secure prime viewing spots for the event.</p>
