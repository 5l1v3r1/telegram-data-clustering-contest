      <p>Hong Kong police said on Monday they are investigating reports that a man was set alight following a heated argument on a day of widespread protests across the city, as videos of the purported attack surfaced online.</p>
      <p>Three videos were posted on messaging channels used by protesters showing a man in a green t-shirt arguing with people on a footbridge, reportedly in the northern district of Ma On Shan.</p>
      <p>A masked man dressed in black then throws a liquid over the man and sets him ablaze as crowds scatter and the victim frantically tries to remove his t-shirt.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Hospital Authority said a man with burns had been admitted to Prince Wales Hospital, the closest facility to Ma On Shan.</p>
      <p>"He's in critical condition," the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>A police spokesperson told AFP that they had received a report on the incident and were investigating.</p>
      <p>The videos have not been verified by AFP, but the footage was picked up by Chinese state media.</p>
      <p>The Global Times tabloid uploaded one of the videos to Twitter, a social media platform banned on the mainland, with the caption: "Black-clad rioters in #HongKong set a resident on fire in Ma On Shan on Monday, Hong Kong police confirmed with the Global Times."</p>
      <p>"Black-clad rioters" is a phrase commonly used by Chinese media to describe pro-democracy protesters.</p>
      <p>What sparked the argument is unclear, but the expletive-laden conversation shows the man in green criticising people sympathetic to Hong Kong's democracy movement, and his opponents berating him back.</p>
      <p>At one point the man in green can be heard saying "none of you are Chinese".</p>
      <p>One of his opponents shouts "Go back to the Greater Bay Area", the name for a nearby region of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong.</p>
