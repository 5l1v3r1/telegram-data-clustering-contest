Its Indian and Singapore units would now be holding <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/companies">companies </a>(holdcos). With this, HFE has become the first Indian renewable energy company to shift base to another region.</p>
      <p>The move is aimed at exposing HFE Global to better financing avenues in the UK and the global market. At the same time, the company plans to use the UK’s trade treaties with several countries especially in African region to expand its base there. It will also now increase its focus on African and South Asian market.</p>
