      <h1>Liverpool 3-1 Man City: Klopp wins latest battle against Guardiola</h1>
      <h2>The Reds moved nine points clear at the top of the Premier League on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:16:15+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Pol Ballús</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool beat Manchester City 3-1 on Sunday to move nine points clear at the top of the Premier League and leave Pep Guardiola's side slumped in fourth.</p>
      <p>Fabinho opened the scoring early on and Salah added the second before half-time when he got on to an Andrew Robertson cross, with the Egyptian adjudged to have been just offside.</p>
      <p>City had chances before the break and could have had a penalty for handball but fell further behind in the second half when Sadio Mane got on the score sheet.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's men continued to push and pulled a goal back through Bernardo Silva but were unable to produce a miracle at Anfield.</p>
      <p>City have now lost three times in the league this season and are behind Liverpool, Leicester City and Chelsea at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool's incredible form continued. Jurgen Klopp's side have won 11 of their 12 games this season, drawing the other, and have a huge cushion at the top going into the international break.</p>
      <p>"It's not important," said Klopp, playing down the significance of the Reds' lead. "Who wants to be first in early November? It's important to be top in May.</p>
      <p>"Each point we have we need to go through the most intense period ever."</p>
