      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel">Marvel Studios</a> president Kevin Feige has responded for the first time in public to the controversy surrounding superhero movies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/04/martin-scorsese-says-marvel-movies-are-not-cinema">first sparked in October by Martin Scorsese</a>, who said they were “not cinema” and closer to “theme parks”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/marvels-kevin-feige-breaks-silence-martin-scorsese-attack-1253710">Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter</a>, Feige brushed off Scorsese’s remarks, saying: “I think that’s not true. I think it’s unfortunate.”</p>
      <p>Feige added: “I think myself and everyone who works on these movies loves cinema, loves movies, loves going to the movies, loves to watch a communal experience in a movie theatre full of people.”</p>
      <p>Scorsese’s views were backed up by fellow directors such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/21/francis-ford-coppola-scorsese-was-being-kind-marvel-movies-are-despicable">Francis Ford Coppola, who described Marvel’s output as “despicable”</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/22/superhero-films-are-cynical-exercise-to-make-profits-for-corporations-ken-loach">Ken Loach, who called them “cynical”</a>. Film-makers such as Joss Whedon and James Gunn, however, defended the Marvel franchise, while Robert Iger, CEO of Disney, which owns Marvel, said: “I don’t get what [Coppola and Scorsese are] criticising us for when we’re making films that people are obviously enjoying going to and they’re doing so by the millions.”</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/05/martin-scorsese-superhero-marvel-movies-debate-sadness">Scorsese later amplified his criticism of superhero movies</a> with an article in the New York Times, in which he said he felt a “terrible sadness” about the state of the industry.</p>
      <p>Feige said: “Everybody has a different definition of cinema. Everybody has a different definition of art. Everybody has a different definition of risk. Some people don’t think it’s cinema. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. Everyone is entitled to repeat that opinion. Everyone is entitled to write op-eds about that opinion, and I look forward to what will happen next. But, in the meantime, we’re going to keep making movies.”</p>
      <p>Feige, who is generally considered the main creative force behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe, has overseen the release of 23 MCU films since 2008 with a worldwide box office of over $22bn, making it by far <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films#Highest-grossing_franchises_and_film_series">the most successful film franchise of all time</a>. Feige has also been asked to collaborate on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/26/marvel-mastermind-kevin-feige-to-develop-new-star-wars-film">a new instalment in the Star Wars series</a>, the second highest grossing franchise of all time.</p>
