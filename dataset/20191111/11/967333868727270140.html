      <p>​The protest started at nine in the morning. Initially, the south-bound lanes of the AP-7 were blocked and an open lane was left in the direction of France, but later the traffic was completely obstructed, according to the Catalan Traffic Service.</p>
      <p>In October, the Spanish Supreme Court ruled to sentence nine Catalan politicians to 9-13 years in prison on sedition charges and another three to fines over disobedience. The court issued European and international arrest warrants for Puigdemont. The rulings triggered a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910291077172643-belgian-prosecutors-agree-to-extradite-ex-catalonia-head-puigdemont-to-spain/">massive wave of violent public protests</a> in Catalonia.</p>
