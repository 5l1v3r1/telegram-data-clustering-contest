        <b>Leeds United captain Liam Cooper has withdrawn through injury from the Scotland squad for their Euro 2020 qualifiers with Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Midfielder Scott McTominay is expected to follow after being carried off during Manchester United's 3-1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>
      <p>Centre-half Cooper was substituted after 72 minutes of Leeds' 2-1 win over Blackburn Rovers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A scan has shown "a small tear in his groin area", Leeds' website reports.</p>

      <p>"The injury is not considered to be major and he will work with staff at Thorp Arch with a view to being fit following the international break," the English Championship club said.</p>
      <p>Scotland, who cannot qualify from Group I but may do through a Nations League play-off, are away to Cyprus on Saturday then host Kazakhstan three days later.</p>
      <p>The loss of Cooper decreases head coach Steve Clarke's options in defence even further.</p>
      <p>Arsenal requested Kieran Tierney be left out as he continues his return from long-term injury, while Wigan Athletic's Charlie Mulgrew and Kilmarnock's Stuart Findlay are both absent from the squad with hamstring problems.</p>
      <p>McTominay is due to have a scan on Monday after the 22-year-old fell awkwardly minutes from the end of United's Premier League game.</p>
