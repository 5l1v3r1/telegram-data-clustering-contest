      <p>A man posed as a 'flirty' woman online to blackmail eight men into handing over cash.</p>
      <p>Paul Snelson from Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire, told victims 'she' would spread intimate photos of them unless they transferred 'her' money.</p>
      <p>The men had sent the fake woman revealing pictures of their private parts after they flirted online, <a href="https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/how-eight-men-fell-flirty-3520954">Grimsby Live reports.</a></p>
      <p>Snelson warned one of the victims if he didn't cough up £60 'she' would post a message online saying "this scum bag has been trying to pay vulnerable young girls to meet up for sex and other disgusting things. Here is his picture."</p>
      <p>Posing as a woman, he told another he'd send a message to his wife saying "your husband is a dirty cheat and has been trying to have sex with young girls online and I have proof."</p>
      <p>Snelson, 23, used online chatroom Craigslist and social media platforms including <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> and Whatsapp to carry out his persistent sting and dupe his victims.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/courts">court</a> Snelson admitted eight offences of blackmail and asked for eight others to be considered.</p>
      <p>He was jailed for three years and four months by Judge Peter Kelson QC branded them very serious offences.</p>

      <h3>Victim 1</h3>
      <p>On June 21, a man put an advert on the Craigslist website asking to trace a woman he had been in contact with from Washington nine months earlier. He received an email from someone posing as a woman and they exchanged messages.</p>
      <p>At Grimsby Crown Court prosecutor Jeremy Evans said: "She asked whether he wanted to meet and asked whether there was any reward for it.</p>
      <p>"She then asked whether he wanted to meet up and offered to pick him up."</p>
      <p>The contact continued on WhatsApp and the fake woman provided her mobile phone number. The messages continued and the 'woman' said she was 19 and "available". She suggested that the reward would be £100 an hour.</p>
      <p>"He then offered her £60, thinking that if she was a genuine escort or prostitute, she would not drop her price any further," said Mr Evans.</p>
      <p>'She' asked for a selfie so he took a picture of himself bare-chested in front of a mirror. He later sent a picture of his private parts.</p>
      <p>The man later got a shocking message from the fake woman saying: "Everyone share!!! This scum bag has been trying to pay vulnerable young girls to meet up for sex and other disgusting things.</p>
      <p>"Here is his picture." She included his phone number and where he lived.</p>
      <p>Underneath the post, Snelson, posing as the woman, wrote: "Look, I'm gonna post this every day for the next two weeks and everywhere if I don't receive my £60 bank transfer.</p>
      <p>"I will post it to every site and ruin your life. It will go to predator exposure, shadow hunter, Pedo Hunter.</p>
      <p>"They have 26,000+ followers. I will message family members and friends, neighbours and everyone.</p>
      <p>"If you think this is a bluff, then call me. Once posted, it will be double to remove."</p>
      <p>More messages were sent showing the faces of two men who had not paid the money and had been sent to Predators Exposed.</p>
      <p>The man called in the police and Snelson was arrested after an investigation.</p>
      <p>He was released pending further investigation but committed other offences.</p>
      <h3>Victim 2</h3>
      <p>Another man using Craigslist posted a message asking for a massage in his Devon home area.</p>
      <p>He received a message supposedly from a woman and she asked him for a photograph of himself so he sent one of his face.</p>
      <p>"The female said that he was hot and asked him for a naked photograph," said Mr Evans.</p>
      <p>"He took a selfie of himself completely naked, including his genital area, and sent it to her."</p>
      <p>Snelson, posing as the woman, sent a message demanding £250 by 6pm or she would send the picture to all his Facebook friends.</p>
      <p>It included a screenshot of his Facebook profile and his 500 friends list.</p>
      <p>He paid £200 but received demands for £2,500.</p>
      <p>Police traced Snelson's bank account.</p>

      <p>She demanded £200, saying: "I want £200 transferred ASAP to my account or this goes all over Edinburgh in every local news group and selling site.</p>
      <p>"I have 12 different Facebook accounts and I will spread you like wildfire.</p>
      <p>"You pay up and I'll delete everything and we never speak again. You don't and I'll keep posting and re-posting for a month.</p>
      <p>"I have also added your Facebook friends to a group message and will send to each one of them."</p>
      <p>The man's father paid £200 for him. A further demand for £140 was made but not paid.</p>

      <p>"I have also added all of your 351 friends to a group message and they will see the post too."</p>
