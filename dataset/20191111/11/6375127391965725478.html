      <h3>PALAYAN CITY – The Nueva Ecija provincial government has forged an agreement with the Magsasaka Partylist or the Magkakasama sa Samahan, Kaunlaran for the procurement of rice bought from the farmers by the Provincial Food Council (PFC).</h3>
      <p>According to the agreement signed by Gov. Aurelio Umali and Magsasaka Partylist Rep. Argel Joseph Cabatbat, the latter’s group will procure from the PFC the rice stocks, which in turn will be sold to the market through their local Magsasaka outlets nationwide.</p>
      <p>“Natutuwa ako sapagkat unti-unti nang natutupad ang aming pangarap na makapagtayo ng maraming Magsasaka outlets sa buong bansa at ‘yan ay maisasagawa namin sa pakikipagtulungan sa provincial government ng Nueva Ecija na direktang bumibili ng palay sa mas mataas na presyo buhat sa pinakamaliliit nating magsasaka sa lalawigan,” said Cabatbat.</p>
      <p>The party-list solon said they will sell the rice lower than the prevailing market price.  </p>
      <p>“Sa pamamagitan nito, nakatulong na kami sa magsasaka, nakatulong din kami sa mga consumer,” he said.</p>
      <p>Umali said this advocacy by the Magsasaka Partylist is a big help to local farmers, especially since Cabatbat’s group is now partnering with the provincial government in bringing the farmers’ local produce to the market not only in Metro Manila but all over the country.</p>
      <p>Umali also agreed to provide the Magsasaka Partylist with a help desk at the provincial capitol to be able to assist those who would want to operate or put up a Magsasaka outlet in the province.</p>
      <p>A Magsasaka outlet has no franchise fee as it only needs accreditation from the Magsasaka Partylist to put up an outlet with the products to be sold like malasakit rice, eggs and cooking oil, all sourced from local farmers.</p>
