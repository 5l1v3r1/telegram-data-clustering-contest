      <p>Lucknow - <b>West Indies</b> skipper Kieron Pollard won the toss and elected to bowl in the third one-day international (ODI) against <b>Afghanistan</b> in Lucknow on Monday.</p>
      <p>The West Indies, who have already taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, made two changes from their previous win on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Debutant batsman Brandon King and all-rounder Keemo Paul make the XI in place of Jason Holder and Sheldon Cottrell.</p>
      <p>"Credit must be given to the players. Guys have stuck to the plans," Pollard said at the toss.</p>
      <p>"It's another opportunity for us to showcase our skills. We need to make something happen. You are always in the game if you keep your head levelled."</p>
      <p>Afghanistan, led by ace spinner Rashid Khan, have also made two changes, with opening batsman Ibrahim Zadran making his ODI debut and paceman Yamin Ahmadzai added to the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Rashid said he would have chosen to bat first anyway as the minnows search for a consolation win.</p>
      <p>"It looks a good track to bat on. Dew wasn't a big factor. We have a good spin attack," said Rashid.</p>
