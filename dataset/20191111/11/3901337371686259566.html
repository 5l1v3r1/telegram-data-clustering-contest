      <p>Maritzburg United’s impressive Friday night record looked to be coming to an end until a last-gasp comeback saw them pick up a 2-2 draw with Bloemfontein Celtic.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Team of Choice are now unbeaten in 17 home game on a Friday evening, stretching back to 2017, but it didn’t look to be their night as they fell two goals behind and the 87th-minute approached…</p>
      <p>It was then that Daylon Claasen won himself a penalty and converted it, but Judas Moseamedi popped up in the 93rd-minute to grasp a draw from the jaws of defeat for Eric Tinkler’s team that saw them extend their unbeaten run to seven games in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the club’s official website after the game, Tinkler praised their spirit, saying, "We've played three games in seven days, and it was noticeable after the Pirates game that there were a lot of tired legs... I’m not a big fan of making too many changes, but to a degree we were forced to make those changes.<br/><br/>"I'm proud of the boys, they showed character and worked extremely hard. The only thing I can criticise is that we did not take our chances. Chances were there, particularly in the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>"But I can't fault the boys for effort - you're 2-0 down, playing with 10 - you’ve made your three subs, Siyanda (Xulu) gets injured, now you're playing against 11 with 10… They're a very good team in possession, very good team going forward, but we showed character, we came back and we got the draw. We'll count our lucky stars to a degree.</p>

But I think we gave away two points, like we did against Pirates.”</p>
      <p>Maritzburg have now lost just three of their last 19 games in all competitions, and find themselves in eighth place in the Absa Premiership as they prepare for their upcoming Telkom Knockout semifinal.</p>
