      <h1>Liam Cooper delivers Scotland blow as Leeds star pulls out of squad</h1>
      <h2>The 28-year-old limped out of Leeds' win over Blackburn and has withdrawn from the Scotland squad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:36:45+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland will be without defender Liam Cooper after he pulled out of the squad to face Cyprus and Kazakhstan through injury.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds</a> captain limped out of his side's win over Blackburn Rovers with a groin injury, having just returned from a similar problem that saw him miss three games.</p>
      <p>And now the 28-year-old has withdrawn from the Scotland squad and it leaves <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> with just three recognised centre backs, although it's likely he will call someone else in.</p>
      <p>Mikey Devlin, Scott McKenna and Declan Gallagher are the only centre backs available although <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-mctominay">Scott McTominay</a> has played in that role for Manchester United in the past.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charlie-mulgrew">Charlie Mulgrew</a> has been a regular at the back but wasn't included in the current squad and could now be handed a reprieve.</p>
      <p>Sheffield Wednesday's David Bates and Stoke's Liam Lindsay are other options while U21 defender Ryan Porteous could also be be promoted if needed.</p>
      <p>Cooper has been a regular in Scotland squads since his first call-up in 2016 but only made his debut in the 2-1 defeat to Russia in September and also played in the 4-0 hammering to Belgium three days later.</p>
