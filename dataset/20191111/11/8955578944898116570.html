      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 11 – RIA Tomsk, Elena Taylasheva. </b>Tomsk chemists have finished laboratory tests of polyethylene film, which completely decomposes in 4-5 years, adviser to t6he Rector of <a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU) Konstantin Belyakov told RIA Tomsk; according to him, the task to scientists was set by the X5 Retail Group, now there is a search for investors to create industrial technology.</p>
      <blockquote>"Representatives of the X5 Retail Group came to Tomsk at the invitation of TSU in 2017. Among the problems they voiced to scientists was the creation of environmentally friendly polyethylene bags. They're ready to buy them in bulk. And I can say that the team of the Engineering Chemical and Technological Center (ECTC) of TSU offered an advanced, very effective solution as a result", – Belyakov said.</blockquote>
      <p>According to him, a spin-off was created from ECTC under this project – a separate project company "Greenbiotech" – and engineers were able to obtain the first samples of biodegradable films after 2.5 years. Laboratory tests have shown that the film decomposes 4-5 years to the gas condition, that is, completely, which solves the acute problem with the pollution of the planet.</p>
      <p>Quite serious investments (about 3 million dollars) are needed to begin the development of industrial technology on the basis of existing laboratory and manufactured prototypes. Belyakov is now negotiating funding for the next stage of the project with several venture funds.</p>

      <p>However, it turned out that Russian venture investors in mass do not believe that scientists on the periphery, in Siberia can solve a problem that the whole world has been fighting for decades and has not yet made much progress.</p>
      <p>"Convincing them otherwise, that is, turning the perception of the usual scheme of technological transfer from West to East, is insanely difficult. But I hope there will be a person, a team or a foundation that will throw away stereotypes, and the wall of "disbelief" will fall", – Belyakov summed up.</p>
      <p>X5 Retail Group is one of the leading Russian product retail companies. Operates shops under the brands Pyaterochka, supermarkets Perekrestok and hypermarkets Karusel.</p>
