      <h1>Amazon cuts price of cheap wireless headphones in latest sale</h1>
      <h2>The online retailer has cut the price of headphones and vacuum cleaners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:16:06+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Hurrell</a></address>
      <p>Amazon has launched a sale on wireless headphones as it continues the run in to Black Friday.</p>
      <p>The major online shopping day takes place on 29 November but Amazon has already confirmed it will begin launching deals on 22 November, meaning there will be eight days of discounts.</p>
      <p>However, the Amazon Hidden Gem sale opened last week and runs until 12 November, cutting the price of over 4,000 items across electrical, jewellery and fashion.</p>
      <p>The retail giant has cut the price of wireless headphones that are able to use with iPhones and Android smart phones. Originally priced at £99, the headphones have been <a href="https://amzn.to/2O3hfQ7">reduced to £23.99.</a></p>
      <p>The Bluetooth wireless headphones are nearly all claimed during the lightning sale, which runs out today once all items are claimed.</p>
      <p>A second pair of headphones have been reduced to <a href="https://amzn.to/2NBMUck">£21.99 from £30</a> but it is not just earbuds that have been reduced in the sale.</p>
      <p>Amazon is keen to sell a host of electronic devices, many of which are not household brand names. It has reduced the price of robotic vacuum cleaners by up to 25%.</p>
      <p>The vacuum cleaners are not industry leader Roomba but with prices starting from £146.99 the <a href="https://amzn.to/2X1wux3">Amazon deals</a> do undercut the more expensive brand names.</p>
      <p>The Hidden Gems sale is a warm up to the Amazon Black Friday sale.</p>
      <h3>How can you prepare for Amazon's Black Friday sale?</h3>
      <p>Amazon's Black Friday deals are all aimed at getting customers to sign up to its Prime offering and <a href="https://amzn.to/2IQZrFS">Prime users</a> get deals up to 30 minutes before others.</p>
      <p>That means the best way to get the best deals is to sign up for Prime. Amazon regularly runs free trials, which is perfect to get the benefits for the week of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>You can sign up for a <a href="https://amzn.to/2IQZrFS">free trial here.</a></p>
      <p>Creating a <a href="https://amzn.to/31kJ9vs">wishlist here</a> is easy. Then you just have to try to guess what items will be reduced by Amazon.</p>
      <p>As a rough guide Amazon will reduce electronics including TVs, headphones, laptops and tablets. You will also spot discounts on gaming bundles for the Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One and other consoles.</p>
      <p>Toys, clothes, jewellery and board games also feature prominently in the Amazon Black Friday sale.</p>
      <h3>When is Amazon's Black Friday sale?</h3>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/black-friday-2019-how-long-17016870">2019 Black Friday falls on 29 November</a> but Amazon is likely to launch its Black Friday sale at least a week early - so expect a start date of 22 November.</p>
      <p>However that does not rule out Amazon launching some pre-Black Friday deals in the weeks leading up to the 22 November. Black Friday is the brand's biggest shopping day of the year and it is likely it will try to turn it into a month-long event.</p>
