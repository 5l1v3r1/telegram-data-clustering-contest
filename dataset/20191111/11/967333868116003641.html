      <p>This weekend, the news outlet <i>Samhällsnytt</i> has come up with <a href="https://samnytt.se/uppgifter-var-fjarde-ali-i-sverige-ar-domd-for-brott/">a stunning find</a> after comparing data from Statistics Sweden with that from legal information database Lexbase, where information regarding convictions is stored.</p>
      <p><i>Samhällsnytt's</i> search found that nearly a quarter of people named Ali residing in Sweden have a criminal record.</p>
      <p>A search in Statistics Sweden revealed that 40,790 people have Ali as either first name or surname. A search in Lexbase resulted in 9,742 hits, meaning that roughly 24 percent of all Alis in Sweden have a conviction.</p>
      <p>About 6,500 women have 'Ali' as either a first name or a surname, so <i>Samhällsnytt's</i> research highlighted a drastic over-representation of male Alis among those charged. A series of spot-checks revealed “very few women”, the news outlet wrote.</p>
      <p><i>Samhällsnytt's</i> checks for other Islamic names have yielded similar results. For instance, Statistics Sweden lists 26,867 people named Ahmed. By contrast, a search in Lexbase yielded 4,944 hits, which corresponds to 18 percent of all Ahmeds having a criminal record.</p>
      <p>Of the 1,315 Murads found by Statistics Sweden, 274 are present in database, which means 21 percent of them have a conviction.</p>
      <p>The connection between crime and ethnicity has become a hot-button issue in Sweden in recent years. The most recent mapping of migrant crime was carried out in 2005; afterwards, the practice of recording the race or ethnicity of convicted criminals was discontinued <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905301075469257-sweden-sex-crime-report/">for 'ethical reasons'</a>.</p>
      <p>At the same time there is no shortage of independent studies that have highlighted migrants' drastic over-representation in certain types of crime, including rapes and gang rapes. The 2005 study, the last of its kind, showed that foreign-born men were five times more likely to be suspected of sex crimes than native-born Swedes.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Sweden's Crime Prevention Council (Brå) launched a new research project intended to look at the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201904031073778233-sweden-migrant-crime-statistics/">connection between crime and immigration</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, owing to Sweden's <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910151077052967-sweden-doubles-first-generation-immigrants-in-less-than-two-decades/">generous immigration policy of the last decades</a>, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201910081076984141-diversity-erodes-social-trust-danish-study-finds/">immigrants and their descendants</a> are estimated to account for <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201906241076032363-sweden-record-population-change/">about 25 percent</a> of Sweden's total population of 10 million. <br/>Muslims are estimated to account for over 8 percent of Sweden's total population.</p>
