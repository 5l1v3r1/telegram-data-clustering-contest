      <p>The jury hearing the inquest into the death of a schoolgirl who drowned after falling from a theme park's river rapids ride has retired to consider its conclusions.</p>
      <p>Evha Jannath was "propelled" from a six-seater vessel on Splash Canyon at Drayton Manor on May 9 2017, while on an end-of-year school trip with staff and friends from Jameah Girls' Academy in Leicester.</p>
      <p>The inquest has previously heard that the 11-year-old had been repeatedly standing up and "reaching into the water", against the rules of the ride, before the circular boat she was travelling in hit a barrier, sending her head-first into the water.</p>
      <p>Stafford Coroner's Court was told that the emergency stop button for ride was not pressed despite Evha's fall.</p>
      <p>Evha and four friends had boarded the vessel without a teacher after school staff agreed to the pupils' request to go on the ride unaccompanied.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Before sending the jury out to consider its conclusions on Monday, assistant coroner Margaret Jones directed the jury of three men and seven women to find that Evha died an "accidental death".</p>
