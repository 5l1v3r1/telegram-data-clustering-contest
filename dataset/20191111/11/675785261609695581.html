      <p>"All my life I've felt bad about my body," admitted Saira, who spoke about not feeing 'tall, slim or pretty enough' in a candid interview with <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/saira-khan-body-confidence-photoshoot-20856086">OK! magazine.</a></p>

      <p>"My body no longer makes me feel guilty, it gives me pride and strength," said Saira, who wore nothing but a strategically placed white sheet for the shoot.</p>
      <p>Saira - who first shot to fame on the Apprentice - grew up in the Midlands with Pakistani immigrant parents.</p>
      <p>She said she felt pressure to keep to strict rules regarding her regarding behaviour and appearance.</p>
      <p>"I had to wear loose clothes that covered my body. It gave me the message that men can’t control their sexual urges," she explained.</p>

      <p>Saira said she still feels like she has disappointed her mother.</p>
      <p>"She won’t like me wearing lingerie," she admitted. "She really cares about what other people think, but I'm a modern woman and I want to celebrate a time when I finally feel great about myself, it's taken a long time to get here so I'm really proud of this shoot."</p>
      <p>Saira also revealed that she'd kept her nude shoot a secret from her Loose Women co-stars, but said she felt certain they'd be proud of her decision.</p>
