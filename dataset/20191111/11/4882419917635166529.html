      <h1>Messi vs. Lewandowski: the fight to be the top goal scorer in 2019</h1>
      <h2>The Barcelona and Bayern stars are leading the way as we near the end of the year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:52:30+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">sport.es</a></address>
      <p>Lionel Messi's hat-trick against Celta Vigo at the weekend reaffirmed his place among the top three goal scorers in 2019 as we near the end of the calendar year.</p>
      <p>Messi, who missed several games earlier this season due to injury, has now scored 39 goals in 2019, two fewer than Bayern Munich frontman Robert Lewandowski, who leads the way with 41.</p>
      <p>Bar√ßa star Messi's goals have come in 41 games, with 30 of them coming last season and nine, despite injury problems, coming in the current campaign.</p>
      <p>His only real rival is Bayern's Lewandowksi. The Poland striker is in fine form and will make things hard for the Argentine. After a brace against Borussia Dortmund at the weekend, he has scored 41 goals in 40 games -- with 23 of them coming in his last 18 appearances.</p>
      <p>With just over one month to go in the year, Sergio Aguero is third with 34 goals, followed by Kylian Mbappe (31) and Karim Benzema (30), who is eight ahead of former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo (22).</p>
