      <h1>Credit Suisse promotes veteran to boost ailing investment banking unit</h1>

      <p>Credit Suisse is hoping to give its embattled investment banking arm a new lease of life after appointing a company veteran to take charge.</p>
      <p>David Miller, who currently serves as the Swiss bank’s global credit boss, is set to take over as the chief of its investment banking and capital markets unit.</p>
      <p>A quiet market for initial public offerings (IPO) and mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) has been partly blamed for the slowdown in the lender’s investment banking division, which swung to a pre-tax loss during the third quarter.</p>

      <p>A drop in advisory fees for M&amp;A contributed to the six per cent drop in third-quarter revenue within the division.</p>
      <p>Miller, who joined Credit Suisse almost two decades ago, is set to replace James Amine, who will take on a newly-created role as head of private credit opportunities.</p>

      <p>Chairman Urs Rohner said today: “Credit Suisse will greatly benefit from his deep experience across capital markets and investment banking, combined with his broad client relationships both in the U.S. and internationally.”</p>
      <p>A person familiar with the situation told Reuters: “Some deals fell apart, others we missed out on. It is the right time to have a fresh pair of eyes take a look.”</p>
      <p>Analyst Javier Lodeiro at Zuercher Kantonalbank added: “We are positive that a new CEO is coming. He will lead the turnaround of this unit.”</p>
