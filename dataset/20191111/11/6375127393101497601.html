      <h1>3 police majors face ouster over BWC bid extort raps</h1>

      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge, Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa yesterday said three police majors are facing dismissal from the service for allegedly extorting some P5 million from a bidder of body-worn cameras (BWC) last year.</h3>
      <p>Majors Emerson Sales, Rholly Caraggayan and Angel Beros were previously assigned with the technical working group of the PNP National Headquarters Bids and Award Committee (BAC) which supervises all bidding procedures in the police force.</p>
      <p>“In line with President Rodrigo Roa Duterte’s  anti-corruption campaign, the three officials have been subjected to summary dismissal proceedings and may face criminal charges if evidence warrants for alleged extortion in connection with the P334 million procurement of body cameras,” said PNP spokesman, Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac.</p>
      <p>Both Sales and Caraggayan have gone on AWOL (Absence without Official Leave) status while Beros is still in the active service, Banac said.</p>
      <p>“I have found out as chairman of the BAC that three of my men in the technical working group were asking money from the proponent. Sabi ko nga sa kanila, we are trying to prove that government procurement can be clean and here are you putting a very bad example. I promised to the members of the BAC that I will dismiss these three police majors and they’re undergoing now administrative proceedings,” Gen. Gamboa said.</p>
      <p>Journal Group sources said that PNP investigators have discovered that the three sought monetary favors from the BWC proponent in separate occasions.</p>
      <p>There was even one instance when the three reportedly demanded the ‘underwater testing’ of the BWCs being offered for sale in a resort in Tagaytay City.</p>
      <p>After the proponent agreed, the three reportedly brought their families and stayed in separate hotel rooms, their food and lodging paid for by the bidder.</p>
      <p>There was also one instance when one of the three demanded that he be given the same amount of cash received by his two colleagues. Since the bidder was out of cash that time, the officer agreed that a check be written under his name.</p>
      <p>One investigator said that they discovered that the bidder was asked to give the cash in a room at the BAC-NHQ secretariat office which is not covered anymore by a CCTV camera.</p>
      <p>“There is a probability they have also committed a criminal case, then the DIDM (Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management) through CIDG (Criminal Investigation and Detection Group) is obligated to file the criminal case,” said the PNP-OIC.</p>
      <p>According to Gen. Gamboa, the illegal act of the middle-grade officer was exposed after a proponent complained to him that he was disqualified despite having given money to the three .</p>
