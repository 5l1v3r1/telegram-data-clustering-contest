      <h1>House panel passes Malasakit Centers bill</h1>

      <h3>THE House Committee on Ways and Means on Monday approved a substitute measure seeking to institutionalize  Malasakit Centers in all Department of Health (DoH)-run hospitals to further the health assistance for indigent patients.</h3>
      <p>“Malasakit Centers intend to reduce, if not eliminate, out-of-pocket expenditures of indigent and poor patients and improve assessment for patient assistance and referral to provide much needed system support for patient navigation,” said House Majority Leader and Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez and Tingog party-list Rep. Yedda Marie Kittilstvedt Romualdez, two of so many authors of the Malasakit Centers bills.</p>
      <p>“This way we can deliver basic services to communities in the most efficient, responsive and sustainable manner,” the Romualdezes said.</p>
      <p>Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, who chairs the ways and means committee, said his panel approved the tax provision of the measure that was already passed by the House committee on health last September 18.</p>
      <p>“The institutionalization of the Malasakit Center will complement the government’s implementation of its Universal Health Care program,” said Salceda.</p>
      <p>The approved measure was a consolidation of 18 bills for Malasakit Program Act to complement the government’s implementation of its Universal Health Care program or Republic Act (RA) No. 11223.  </p>
      <p>Under the substitute measure, all DOH-run hospitals are required to establish a Malasakit Center, which is supposed to be a one-stop shop inside hospitals where patients can get medical assistance from different government agencies.</p>
      <p>The proposed “Malasakit Program Act,” a project which was initiated by Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, seeks to complement the objectives of the Universal Healthcare Act. Albay Rep. Edcel Lagman said the program is being used for partisan tool.</p>
      <p>The measure would give patients access to medical and financial aid from the DOH, Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), and Office of the President.</p>
      <p>Other public hospitals that are not being operated by the DOH can also put up Malasakit Centers for as long as the local government units (LGUs) can fund it and DOH requirements are met.</p>
      <p>The bill said that the medical assistance covered under the measure meant to cover those that are not paid for by PhilHealth.</p>
      <p>Under this year’s P3.7 trillion national budget, P1 billion was allocated to fund Malasakit Centers, which opposition Rep. Edcel Lagman said should be investigated “because it is more of a partisan tool than a medical outlet.”</p>
