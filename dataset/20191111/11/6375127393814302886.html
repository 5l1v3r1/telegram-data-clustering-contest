      <h3>UP coach admits UST played a great game.</h3>
      <p>UNIVERSITY of the Philippines is hoping and praying to finally solve a puzzle in University of Santo Tomas in tomorrow’s do-or-die match for the remaining Finals spot in the UAAP men’s basketball tournament.</p>
      <p>Coach Bo Perasol admitted that the Fighting Maroons were outclassed in last Sunday’s 69-89 loss to the Growling Tigers that forced the step-ladder semis to a decider.</p>
      <p>“The way we played in most of the quarters, there’s just no way we can win against UST. We need to be a lot better. We cannot just be the recipient of their aggressiveness. We need to match them,” said Perasol. </p>
      <p>UP didn’t look like a team that finished No. 2 in the eliminations as it never tasted the lead in the 40-minute match to the disappointment of the Maroon-clad crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</p>
      <p>“They understand that the reason that we lost three times this season against UST is because they outplayed and outhustled us,” said Perasol. </p>
      <p>“It has nothing to do with what we should have done defensively. If they are faster, we could not catch them. We couldn’t find a way to find the defensive rebound, they are going to get the second chance points,” he added. </p>
      <p>Reigning MVP Bright Akhuetie and Juan Gomez de Liaño were the only bright spots for the Maroons as Kobe Paras and Ricci Rivero were huge disappointments.</p>
      <p>Paras was held to single digits for the first time this season, while Rivero looked clueless on the floor. </p>
      <p>Perasol emphasized the need for his troops to avoid being individualistic on the floor.</p>
      <p>“It has to be everybody else. If they are doing that and the others are not doing their jobs, we are just going to be outscored and outhustled. It couldn’t be one, two or three, it has to be everybody. Against a team that is aggressive, we have to at least match that or be better than them,” said Perasol.</p>
      <p>Conditioning has also played a huge factor in the loss, as the Tigers were performing with boundless energy.</p>
      <p>“Conditioning-wise? What can we do in the next two days is important. That’s what we need to address,” said Perasol.</p>
      <p>The winner of the 4 p.m. match tomorrow at the Mall of Asia Arena will take on defending champion Ateneo in the best-of-three championship starting Saturday. </p>
