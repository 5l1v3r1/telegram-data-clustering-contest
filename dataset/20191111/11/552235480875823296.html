      <h2>The astonishing picture of the pair's fathers together was discovered by coincidence while on set of their new movie The Gentlemen.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:01:54+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>Hollywood stars Guy Ritchie and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hugh-grant">Hugh Grant</a> have recreated an imagine showing their dads in the same Scottish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/armed-forces">army</a> regiment 65 years ago.</p>
      <p>The two men, Captain John Ritchie and Captain James Grant, were stationed in Singapore as part of the Seaforth Highlanders.</p>
      <p>The astonishing picture of the pair's fathers together was discovered by coincidence while on set of their new movie The Gentlemen.</p>
      <p>And it transpired that the grandfather of production assistant Rory Gibb was also in the picture.</p>
      <p>So the men posed beside each other, 65 years after the original photo, to recreate the image with striking resemblance to their relatives.</p>

      <p>Director Guy Ritchie, 51, shared the images on Instagram to mark <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/remembrance-day">Remembrance Day</a> .</p>
      <p>He wrote: "This first picture was taken 65 years ago in Singapore where my dad Captain John Ritchie and Hugh Grant’s dad - Captain James Grant were stationed in the same regiment, the Seaforth Highlanders.</p>
      <p>"The second picture taken on a film set in London 65 years later, has one grandson and two sons recreating that original image.</p>
      <p>"We’d discovered by co-incidence that Rory Gibb, our Production Assistant on the film‘s grandad was in that same original picture. You can see the resemblance.</p>

      <p>"The third image is of my dad and grandad. My granddad, Major Stewart Ritchie, died in 1940 in France in WW2. </p>
      <p>"Spare a thought today for the men and women in uniform who have fallen in defence and service of others. #RemembranceDay #RemembranceSunday."</p>
      <p>The Seafroth Highlanders was an infantry regiment of the British Army and was associated with large areas of northern Highlands of Scotland.</p>
