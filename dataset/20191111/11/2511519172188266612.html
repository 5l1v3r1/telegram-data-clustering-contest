      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/drake">Drake</a>'s surprise headline appearance at Tyler, the Creator's annual <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/camp-flog-gnaw">Camp Flog Gnaw</a> festival ended in embarrassment for the Canadian hip-hop star, after he was booed off the stage by fans. </p>
      <p>A number of videos, including an Instagram live recording that has since gone viral, suggested fans were expecting <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/frank-ocean">Frank Ocean</a> would be the special guest. </p>
      <p>Ocean is a friend and collaborator of Tyler, the Creator, and has recently released new singles including "In My Room" and "DHL". </p>
      <p>In awkward footage, Drake is seen telling the audience: "Like I said, I'm here for you," and, "If you want me to keep going, I'll keep going."</p>
      <p>He was then met with a chorus of "no!"s and booing, to which he responded: "It's been love. I go by the name of Drake, thank you for having me," before leaving the stage. </p>
      <p>Watch the video below: </p>
      <p>His exit took place a reported 20 minutes before his set was supposed to conclude. </p>
