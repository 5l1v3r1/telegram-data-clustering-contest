      <h2>Rob Greenfield managed to build an entire house, then move into it, for less than £2,000 - but didn't stop the money-saving there. He spent the next year without spending a penny on food either</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:31:19+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Mollie Mansfield, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>A year ago Rob Greenfield wondered if it was still possible to live off the land in the 21st century - so decided to find out.</p>
      <p>On 10 November 2018 he decided to opt out of consumerism, stopped buying food and started building a house.</p>
      <p>Instead, he'd forage, fish, plant, and cook everything himself - for free.</p>
      <p>"When I set out to do this, I wasn't sure if it could be done, but I really wanted to find out," said Rob, 33, from Florida.</p>
      <p>"I'm standing here today, one-year later, and I did it.</p>
      <p>"Not only did I make it, but I feel healthier and happier than when I started."</p>

      <p>Step one was the house - starting from scratch Rob put it all together himself for just £1,160.</p>
      <p>Along with the house was the garden - with Rob turning the land surrounding his new home into a mini fruit and veg farm to ensure he had a supply of essentials.</p>
      <p>But while it cost him nothing, it was far from simple.</p>
      <p>"It's safe to say it was a very demanding full-time endeavor," Rob said.</p>
      <p>"I often worked 40 to 80 hours per week to plant, harvest and maintain the garden, forage foods, cook, preserve and clean dishes.</p>
      <p>"I often couldn't take a true break from it, because if I did then I would either not have all the food I needed, or something would fall apart."</p>

        <b>Rob's old diet</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breakfast - bowl of cereal, milk</li>
        <li>Lunch - lunch meat sandwich</li>
        <li>Dinner - frozen pizza</li>
        <li>Snacks - cheese strings, yoghurt, banana</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b> Rob's 'foraged food' diet</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breakfast - mango, starfruit, coconut, moringa, turmeric, holy basil smoothie</li>
        <li>Lunch - yuca, green papaya, greens and herbs</li>
        <li>Dinner - yuca, fish, greens, herbs</li>
        <li>Snacks - coconut, honey, greens, starfruit</li>
      </ul>

      <p>But at the end of it he came out whole and healthy, despite the effort.</p>
      <p>"I expected it to be extremely difficult and it was, but no more than expected - my body feels about as good as I can recall in my adult life," Rob said.</p>
      <p>"I maintained my weight - my body fat measurement is 15%, so plenty of fat on me and I didn't get sick once."</p>
      <p>But there were things he missed.</p>
      <p>"I generally didn't miss any particular food, but what I did miss was convenience," Rob said.</p>
      <p>"I missed having other people make meals for me and even more so just making meals with friends.</p>
      <p>"I still did that sometimes as I had a lot of friends over for dinner, but I was sometimes socially isolated by how demanding this year was."</p>

      <p>As for what's next, Rob said he will try and keep up with some of what he's learnt, if not stay wholly reliant on foraged foods.</p>
      <p>"For the next year or two I intend to do a lot of travelling, which means I will not have my own garden.</p>
      <p>"Everywhere I go I intend to forage whether it be the edible 'weeds' in people's front yards or taking trips to the public parks or deeper nature.</p>
      <p>"I will seek out local foragers who know the region who I can go out with and share the experience with.</p>
      <p>"As much as this may seem like an individualistic project, it was all about community.</p>
      <p>"I could not have done this without the support of community - everything I learned came from people before me.</p>
      <p>"It's all about coming together as communities to care for one another and make sure that everyone has their basic needs met to live a happy and healthy life."</p>
