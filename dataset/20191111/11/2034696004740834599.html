      <p>Fleetwood, who curated the list of artists performing, said: “The concert is a celebration of those early blues days where we all began, and it’s important to recognize the profound impact Peter and the early Fleetwood Mac had on the world of music.</p>
      <p>“Peter was my greatest mentor and it gives me such joy to pay tribute to his incredible talent. I am honoured to be sharing the stage with some of the many artists Peter has inspired over the years and who share my great respect for this remarkable musician. ‘Then Play On’…”</p>
      <p>Green founded the original guise of Fleetwood Mac in 1967 and he performed in the band until 1970. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://nme.com/tag/glastonbury">Glastonbury</a> boss Emily Eavis recently ruled out <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fleetwood-mac-and-led-zeppelin-ruled-out-of-playing-glastonbury-2020-2556758">Fleetwood Mac as a potential headliner</a> for the iconic festival’s 50th anniversary next year.</p>
      <p>It comes after Fleetwood Mac, who have long been linked with the festival, heightened speculation when <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/fleetwood-mac-tease-glastonbury-2020-appearance-wembley-stadium-show-2509791">Mick Fleetwood told fans at their Wembley show that they still “had a big field to play”</a>, before reiterating their desire to play Glastonbury in a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fleetwood-mac-interview-tour-uk-wembley-mick-christine-mcvie-stevie-nicks-a8887971.html"><i>subsequent interview.</i></a></p>
