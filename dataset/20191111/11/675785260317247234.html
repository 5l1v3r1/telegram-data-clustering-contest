      <h2>Valerie Graves, 55, was bludgeoned to death by Cristian Sabou at a luxury £1.6million property where she was house-sitting in Bosham, West Sussex, just days after Christmas in 2013</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:24:49+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Michael Drummond, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A Romanian man who <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/murder">murdered</a> a grandmother with a claw hammer during a burglary just days after Christmas has been jailed for life.</p>
      <p>The brutal death of Valerie Graves shocked the small village of Bosham in West Sussex, and was dubbed “The Midsomer Murder” as police spent years looking for the killer.</p>
      <p>As her family slept in rooms nearby, the 55-year-old artist was bludgeoned to death in the ground-floor bedroom of a £1.6million waterside property where she was house-sitting for wealthy friends who were on holiday.</p>
      <p>After eluding justice for years, Cristian Sabou, who was arrested in Dej, Romania in July, pleaded guilty to her murder with help from a translator when he appeared at Lewes Crown Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>As he was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years, the victim's devastated family declared: "Justice has finally been served."</p>

      <p>Ms Graves' elderly mother - who was also staying at the house along with Ms Graves' sister and her sister's partner - died before she could see her daughter's killer finally caught and put behind bars.</p>
      <p>Sentencing, Judge Christine Laing QC told Sabou: "Rather than simply running away in the hope you could not be identified by a woman waking from sleep you conducted this horrific attack on Ms Graves.</p>
      <p>"It was your dishonesty and greed that took you to the house. It was your cowardice and lack of morality that caused you to kill Valerie Graves."</p>
      <p>Sabou, 28, appeared in the packed courtroom wearing a beige jumper, flanked by three security guards.</p>

      <p>Speaking through an interpreter, he pleaded guilty to a charge of murder.</p>
      <p>Ms Graves - whose birthday was on Christmas Day - had just moved down from Scotland to be closer to her family, with whom she spent the holiday before she was found dead with severe head injuries on December 30, while living with and caring for her mother.</p>
      <p>Her injuries were caused by forces similar to a road crash, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC told the court that Sabou had entered the house as a would-be burglar, expecting it to be empty.</p>

      <p>He had worked odd jobs for the homeowners in the previous couple of months and had been at the house where the murder would later take place.</p>
      <p>The court heard that he had been informed that a safe in the house contained a large amount of cash and ingots, and he cycled there believing it would be empty over the holidays.</p>
      <p>He entered through an unlocked rear door to the bedroom where Ms Graves was sleeping.</p>
      <p>It is believe she woke up and he panicked and repeatedly struck her with the 30cm hammer several times, causing horrific injuries to her head and face as she tried to defend herself.</p>

      <p>He then cycled away and threw the hammer away.</p>
      <p>Mr Bennetts said: "There were extensive injuries to her head.</p>
      <p>"The level of force used was extreme. Not dissimilar from the forces experienced during road traffic collisions."</p>
      <p>Ms Graves was last seen alive at 10pm on December 29, 2013 when she told her family she was going to bed, taking her books and iPad with her as she left the lounge.</p>
      <p>Her sister found her body and the bloody murder scene the following morning and rang 999 for help.</p>

      <p>Police found the murder weapon about 600 metres (2,000ft) away from the scene at the driveway to a nearby farm.</p>
      <p>The killing sparked one of the longest murder hunts in Sussex Police history - codenamed Operation Ensign - but it was not until July this year that Sabou was arrested in Romania on a European warrant and charged and extradited to the UK.</p>
      <p>He was investigated by police after a tip-off from his ex-wife, who had discovered he was cheating on her after they returned to their homeland, it was reported at the time of his arrest.</p>
      <p>Sabou and his wife remained in the UK after the grandmother's death in a village used to film scenes for the TV detective series Midsomer Murders.</p>
      <p>But four years after the killing he moved back to Romania and was working in construction until his former wife revealed he was the killer and he was arrested.</p>

      <p>Police launched a massive investigation, interviewing more than 9,500 people and taking 3,000 DNA samples in an attempt to find her killer.</p>
      <p>The voluntary DNA collection campaign was launched after police obtained a limited DNA profile of a suspect in November 2014.</p>
      <p>Ms Graves' family offered a £20,000 reward and a detective appeared on the BBC's Crimewatch TV programme to appeal for tips, but the case went cold until a tip-off in September 2018.</p>
      <p>Investigators received information from Romania suggesting that Sabou was responsible for the murder.</p>
      <p>Police said after the hearing: "Checks showed that Sabou had left the UK on in October 2018 and had returned to Cluj-Napoca in Romania.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"The information received reported that Sabou been seen looking a pictures of the hammer on a news site and it was similar to one he used himself for work."</p>
      <p>Police soon learned that at the time of the murder Sabou was living in a caravan on an industrial site near the Chichester area close to the A27.</p>
      <p>He had previously accompanied a friend to the house where Ms Graves was later murdered to do some work there.</p>
      <p>At some point around February this year, officers managed to get Sabou's DNA from evidence obtained in Romania. After his DNA matched the profile obtained in 2014, a European arrest warrant was issued and Sussex Police officers were present when he was arrested by Romania's national police in July.</p>
      <p>He was extradited to the UK nine days later and he "maintained that he did not go to the house that night to kill or harm anyone, his intention was to carry out a burglary and what happened on that night will live with him forever", said police.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the sentencing, Ms Graves' family said in a statement: "This has been a devastating experience for the whole family and today we feel that justice has finally been served.</p>

      <p>"We have had to endure six years of waiting, not knowing if anyone would ever be brought to justice for this cowardly act.</p>
      <p>"Val, our mum, was very much loved by our family and is sorely missed by all of us. She was a kind and caring person who had little conflict in her life; her murder was incomprehensible to us all.</p>
      <p>"Her death still remains deeply distressing and we find it hard to understand why he chose to take her life in the manner in which he did.</p>
      <p>"You took away our mum, who was also a sister, daughter, gran and friend to many - a life of someone who can never be replaced.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, Val's mother passed away never knowing that justice has been served.</p>
      <p>"We hope that, while he is serving his sentence, he will reflect on the actions he took and what this has done to our family.</p>
      <p>"We would like to thank Sussex Police, especially Detective Chief Inspector John Fanner, Detective Chief Superintendent Jason Taylor, Detective Inspector Wendy Burton, Detective Constable Jon Woolley, Detective Constable Polly Sweeney and the rest of the team that have worked tirelessly over the last six years to bring our family closure and justice."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Sussex Police called it one of the "largest and most complex investigations" in recent years.</p>
      <p>Senior investigating officer Detective Chief Inspector Jon Fanner said: "Since the tragic murder of Valerie in December 2013, we have never given up hope that we would solve the case and achieve justice for Valerie and her family.</p>
      <p>“Valerie was a loved mother and grandmother who was enjoying time with her family at Christmas when her life was brutally brought to an end.</p>
      <p>“My thoughts and sympathies are with Valerie’s family and friends who have always supported our investigation, showing strength, patience and dignity during a traumatic period of their lives. </p>
      <p>“This has been a lengthy and complex case involving a huge number of enquiries and the biggest mass DNA screening process the force has ever carried out.</p>
      <p>“Although Sabou admitted killing Valerie, it was only when he was finally arrested over five years later. He will now face many years in prison.</p>
      <p>“I hope Valerie’s family will be able to find some peace, knowing that her killer is finally behind bars.</p>

      <h3>Murdered gran 'a free spirit who enjoyed her life'</h3>
      <p>In the winter of 2013, when families across the country were wrapped up warm enjoying the last days of the festive period, tragedy struck in a small coastal village.</p>
      <p>Valerie Graves' family had been excited to spend Christmas with her after she moved down from Scotland.</p>
      <p>But the unthinkable happened. The beloved grandmother and "free spirit" artist was found bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of a luxury home the family had been spending the holidays in.</p>
      <p>Her family and friends were devastated, and the village of Bosham in West Sussex was left in shock.</p>
      <p>And to pile on to her family's grief, it has taken nearly six years to bring her killer to justice.</p>
      <p>Extradited to the UK from Romania in July this year, Cristian Sabou pleaded guilty to her murder on Monday.</p>

      <p>In the days after her death Ms Graves' family paid tribute to their loved one, all the while issuing emotional appeals for information about what happened.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-two Ms Graves had recently moved to nearby Bracklesham Bay to be closer to her family.</p>
      <p>Following the murder, her son Tim Wood said: "My mum was much loved and will be sorely missed by the whole family.</p>
      <p>"She was a free spirit who enjoyed her life and was a talented artist.</p>
      <p>"She had lived in Scotland for about 10 years, a place she loved and which inspired her passion for art.</p>
      <p>"This has been devastating for the family and has come as a complete shock."</p>
      <p>Her family described her as "an eternal student who was always hungry for a new challenge".</p>
      <p>At the time of her death Ms Graves had begun to pursue ceramics as a new avenue for her art.</p>
