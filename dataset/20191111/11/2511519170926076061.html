      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FabioCapello">Fabio Capello</a> has criticised <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/CristianoRonaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and said <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/maurizio-sarri">Maurizio Sarri</a> was right to take the Portuguese forward off. </p>
      <p>Ronaldo reacted angrily to Sarri's decision to substitute him 55 minutes into <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Juventus">Juventus</a>' game against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ACMilan">AC Milan</a>, leaving the stadium before full-time.</p>
      <p>And Capello has supported Sarri's choice to take off Ronaldo, saying that he had not dribbled past anyone "in the last three years".</p>
      <p>"[Cristiano] is a great champion, nobody argues with that, but he hasn't dribbled past anyone in the last three years," Capello told <i>Sky Sport Italia</i>.</p>
      <p>"At the moment he isn't at his best and it is normal to replace him. Sarri doesn't need to be brave or show his personality to make that change.</p>
      <p>"It's not nice that he didn't sit on the bench [after being taken off] and argued with Sarri.</p>
      <p>"One has to be a champion even when he is replaced, not only when things are going well. He must respect his team-mates."</p>
      <p>Ronaldo was also replaced during Juventus' Champions League game against Lokomotiv Moscow, on both occasions replaced by Paulo Dybala with the game level.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Dybala scored an excellent goal to edge out Milan and ensure Juventus go into the international break top of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Serie_A">Serie A</a>.</p>
      <p>The 1-0 victory took the Turin-based side back ahead of Inter Milan at the top of the table.</p>
