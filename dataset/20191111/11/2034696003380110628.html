        <b>"Everybody is entitled to their opinion."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige has weighed-in on Martin Scorsese’s recent comments about the studio’s movies.</p>
      <p>The <i>Irishman</i> director <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-elaborates-earlier-criticism-marvel-films-2564495">recently elaborated</a> on his <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-claims-marvel-movies-not-cinema-2554040">critical words</a> in a new piece, suggesting that Marvel movies lack “revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger” and that “nothing is at risk”.</p>
      <p>Responding to Scorsese, Feige told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/awards-chatter-podcast-kevin-feige-avengers-endgame-1253678"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>‘s ‘Awards Chatter’ podcast: “I think that’s not true. I think it’s unfortunate.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“I think myself and everybody that works on these movies loves cinema, loves movies, loves going to the movies, loves to watch a communal experience in a movie theater full of people… I think it’s fun for us to take our success and use it to take risks and go in different places.</p>
      <p>“Everybody has a different definition of cinema. Everybody has a different definition of art. Everybody has a different definition of risk.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Some people don’t think it’s cinema. Everybody is entitled to their opinion. Everyone is entitled to repeat that opinion. Everyone is entitled to write op-eds about that opinion. And I look forward to what will happen next. But in the meantime, we’re going to keep making movies.”</p>

      <p>Martin Scorsese</p>
      <p>In his recent comments, Scorsese elaborated: “The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes. They are sequels in name but they are remakes in spirit, and everything in them is officially sanctioned because it can’t really be any other way.”</p>
      <p>Scorsese’s words have caused plenty of debate among big Hollywood names, with Marvel directors <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/taika-waititi-hits-back-martin-scorceses-marvel-comments-course-cinema-2557563">Taika Waiti</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/martin-scorsese-claims-marvel-movies-not-cinema-2554040">James Gunn</a> defending the studio’s output, while <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/robert-downey-jr-responds-martin-scorsese-criticism-marvel-movies-2554890">Robert Downey Jr</a> said he “respects” Scorsese’s opinion.</p>
      <p>However, the likes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/jennifer-aniston-thinks-marvel-diminishing-thanks-marvel-movies-2555540">Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/im-not-a-fan-roland-emmerich-agrees-with-martin-scorsese-about-marvel-movies-2565585">Roland Emmerich</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/francis-ford-coppola-supports-martin-scorcese-calling-marvel-films-despicable-2559022">Francis Ford Coppola</a> have been on the other side of the divide, the latter calling Marvel movies “despicable”.</p>
