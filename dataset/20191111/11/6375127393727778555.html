      <h3>Presidential Communications Operation Office (PCOO) Secretary Martin Andanar said China agreed to strengthen its  and the Philippines’ media and communications industry during China Media Group’s  (CMG)  courtesy visit yesterday to the Philippine Information Agency headquarters in Quezon City.</h3>
      <p>“The cooperation between the Philippine and Chinese media escalated to levels that are unheard of. We hope that even with the departure of Ambassador Zhao (Jianhua), we can maintain the same good relationship,” Andanar said.</p>
      <p>Andanar also thanked CMG-member outlets such as China Central Television (CCTV), China Global Television Network (CGTN), and China Radio International (CRI) on their fair coverage of developments in the Philippines.  </p>
      <p>“We are very grateful to the commitment of CMG. I experience very good coverage from CCTV and CRI whenever I go (to) different parts of the world,” he said.</p>
      <p>Andanar  attributed the good coverage to the close relationship between the two countries under the Duterte administration.</p>
      <p>“The relationship of the Philippines and China has raised to a new level since President Duterte was elected into office,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the CMG delegation  led by Huang Chuanfang, a member of its editorial board,  thanked the Philippine government for supporting their journalists who seek requests for interviews and helping to give them deeper understanding on local issues.</p>
      <p>The PCOO has multiple bilateral agreements with the Chinese government on media communications’ personnel exchanges, workshops, seminars, information exchanges, rebroadcasts, joint production, and mutual visits.</p>
