It has a huge outdoor terrace, and not only does it serve up some innovative drinks, it’s laying on a special dining deal for Eat, Sip, Save. For Dhs99 you can get lamb shank with gravy and polenta plus a pint of craft hops. What a bargain. We’ll see you after work (or maybe for a sneaky lunch break).<br/><i>Open daily noon-3am. Emirates Financial Towers, DIFC (054 994 0438).</i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/boca"><b>BOCA</b></a><br/>This cool Mediterranean restaurant in Dubai’s <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/area-guides/difc">DIFC</a> is offering up a brand-new dish as part of our month-long campaign. Get the Emirati sea bass linguine (made with locally sourced fish fillet paired with black garlic and squid ink) for Dhs136, and you’ll get a free glass of grape to wash it down with. There’s also a <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/brunch">brunch</a> package up for grabs, where you’ll save Dhs45 on whatever package you choose – meaning the soft package is Dhs200 (from Dhs245), <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/vegandubai">vegan</a> package is Dhs300 from Dhs345, house drinks Dhs350 from Dhs395 and bubbly Dhs450 from Dhs495. You can also get the paella club package every Satuday and Sunday for Dhs200 instead of Dhs249. Finally, BOCA is also offering discounts on the festive packages (which start on Sunday November 17) for Dhs250 instead of Dhs295 for soft drinks, Dhs350 instead of Dhs395 for house beverages and Dhs545 instead of Dhs590 for bubbly. If that doesn’t get you in the mood for Christmas, we don’t know what will.<br/><i>Open Thu-Tue noon-2am, Wed noon-3am. DIFC (04 323 1833).</i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/burger-and-lobster"><b>Burger &amp; Lobster</b></a><br/>You know the drill, this Dubai restaurant does what it says on the proverbial tin. And this month if you buy any burger and a house drink, you’ll get the whole thing for Dhs99. All burgers (apart from the mighty Beast) are included in the deal, so get your chops around that. Or if you’re dining with an equally peckish diner, opt for any burger meal and you’ll get one 6oz classic burger sandwich absolutely free. Pass us that ketchup, it’s going to get messy.<br/><i>Open Sat-Wed noon-midnight, Thu-Fri noon-2am. Burj Daman Building, DIFC (04 514 8838).</i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/dustys-dubai"><b>Dusty’s</b></a><br/>What’s better than a bubbly brunch? One at half the price, of course. Get down to DIFC with your best mate and enjoy a buy-one-get-one free deal on the bubbly brunch package. The package usually comes in at Dhs499 meaning you can enjoy four-hours of free-flowing drinks and tasty bites for under Dhs250. This is a party brunch that focuses on good music, good vibes and great food. If you’re after something a bit more low-key, you can also head down for dinner and enjoy a plate of pasta and a glass of house grape for Dhs95.<br/><i>Open Sun-Wed 7.30am-midnight; Thu 7.30am-2am; Fri 1pm-2am. Al Fattan Currency House, DIFC (04 354 5435).</i><br/><br/><b>Fogo De Chão</b><br/>This cool Brazilian restaurant in DIFC has an awesome deal that carnivores will want to check out. Every day you can head to the lounge area and order up a picanha burger and two drinks for Dhs100. The burger, which is normally Dhs99 on its own, is topped with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, chimichurri aioli and served on a brioche bun with fries.<br/><i><i>Dhs99. Daily 4pm-11pm. Central Park Tower, DIFC (04 3438867).</i></i><br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/brunch/402374-friday-brunch-at-original-wings-rings"><b>Original Wings &amp; Rings</b></a><br/>Doing exactly what is says on the tin, this casual DIFC bar is a huge hit with wing-lovers. The all-American hangout offers a variety of delicious sauces at varying spice levels, including one that you have to sign a waiver for as it’s that hot. For Dhs199, throughout November you can enjoy unlimited numbers of these lip-lickingly tasty meaty wings and bottomless hops to wash them all down with – and to take the edge of the spiciness.<br/><i>Open daily 4pm-8pm.
