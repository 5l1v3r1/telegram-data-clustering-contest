      <p>Cape Town - A pest-control squad was called to Buckingham Palace to tackle a rodent infestation after health inspectors found mouse and rat droppings on-site.</p>
      <p>Popular tea spot Garden Café, which is situated outside by the palace lawn, has been hit by a rodent infestation, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1202436/Royal-news-The-Queen-Buckingham-Palace-infestation-mouse-mice-rats-rodents-London"><b>Express UK</b></a> reports.</p>
      <p>"[Taking tea at the Garden Café is] a huge treat – the closest most people can get to Her Majesty. So this is embarrassing," said an insider.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mouse-infestation-hits-buckingham-palace-20850449"><b>Mirror</b></a>, inspectors spotted rodent droppings beneath the café’s sink and near the dishwasher.</p>
      <p>This prompted officials to call an exterminator and teach staff pest control techniques.</p>
      <p>In June it was also reported that the monarch was left "horrified" after a plague of rats and mice infested the kitchens of the palace, which dates back to 1703, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9353987/queen-left-horrified-by-plague-of-buckingham-palace-rats-as-court-calls-pest-control/"><b>The Sun</b></a> reported.</p>
