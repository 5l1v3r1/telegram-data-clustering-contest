        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Thousands of people expressed their anger with the Shiv Sena political party for parting ways with the Narendra Modi government and trying to form a government with arch-rival the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).</b>
      </p>
      <p>India's major Hindu right-wing party Shiv Sena announced separation from the country's ruling Narendra Modi-led government on Monday after the former refused to support the formation of a government in the key state of Maharashtra over new political arithmetic and power-sharing.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena who rules the country's wealthiest local body in Mumbai, is set to meet Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to hand over a letter of support and seek time to form a majority in the Maharashtra State Legislature assembly later today.</p>
      <blockquote>"It is due to the BJP's arrogance that they are refusing to form a government in Maharashtra. It is an insult to the people of Maharashtra. They are willing to sit in opposition, but they are reluctant to follow the 50-50 formula, which they had agreed before the polls," said Sanjay Raut, a Shiv Sena spokesperson and parliamentarian on Monday.</blockquote>
      <p>Shiv Sena's sole representative in the Narendra Modi cabinet, Union Minister for Heavy Industries Arvind Sawant also announced his resignation from his post on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Sawant accused the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of dishonouring the formula for power-sharing which was agreed between the two major political parties ahead of the country's General Elections in May this year.</p>
      <blockquote>"It was acceptable to both sides, but by rejecting it, an attempt has been made to portray the (Shiv) Sena as a liar. This is shocking and a blot on the state's self-respect," Sawant said.</blockquote>
      <p>The resignation comes a day after the opposition party Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) - with whom Shiv Sena looks to form a government - asked Shiv Sena to first exit the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance), as it had one cabinet post (in the Narendra Modi government).</p>
      <p>In the state of Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena, the second-largest party in the 288-member State Assembly with 56 MLAs after the BJP (105), had been asking the latter to agree to provide it with half of the full 5-year term to run the new government, as per the 50:50 formula agreed ahead of the election.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, thousands of people have expressed their utter displeasure against the Shiv Sena for parting their ways with the Narendra Modi government and trying to form a government with arch-rival the NCP.</p>

      <p>​Some of the supporters have been recalling the words of Bal Thackeray- founder of Shiv Sena- when he had once called the NCP the enemy and promised that he would never join hands with his enemy (NCP).</p>

      <p>​People are saying that the betrayal by Shiv Sena is on multiple levels including the people's mandate and Hindutva (the Hindu ideology).</p>

      <p>​For many who had dumped the Congress Party ahead of the elections for Shiv Sena, there has been an expectation of tough days ahead, in order to defend the government.</p>

      <p>​Nevertheless, separation of Shiv Sena from the Indian government will not impact the status of the government as the BJP has a majority in the Lok Sabha (Lower House of the parliament) attained by winning 303 seats. Elections were held for 542 of the total 543 seats.</p>
