      <h1>DILG to present ‘real score’ in drug war</h1>

      <h3>INTERIOR and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año yesterday announced the launching of the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs Information System (AIDIS), a web-based centralized information system that will record the real score in the anti-illegal drugs drive.</h3>
      <p>According to Año, AIDIS will be a big help to the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs (ICAD) since relevant information and figures on the problem of illegal drugs from the different drug agencies will be stored in the system.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the DILG chief said that Vice President Leni Robredo as ICAD co-chair will be a huge asset in bringing out the right information to the international community, particularly the European Union, that the government is winning in the supply reduction and demand reduction aspects of the anti-illegal drugs campaign.</p>
      <p>The new web-based info system will serve as a central repository and reporting system that will collect, store, map and analyze data on illegal drugs nationwide.</p>
      <p>“Through this web-based online system, we can now generate reliable data that we can use to map out our strategies and plans to further boost our anti-illegal drugs drive,” he said.</p>
      <p>During the AIDIS launching, the DILG, Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB), and the Department of Health (DOH) signed the Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) on the Community-Based Drug Rehabilitation Program (CBDRP).</p>
      <p>CBDRP is an integrated model for drug users with low to moderate risk of drug dependence with an easy access to rehabilitation and integrated programs through community-based treatment and community-based support services.</p>
      <p>According to Año, data generated from AIDIS will also hopefully bring out the real score on the anti-illegal drugs drive and address the wrong information and figures so that the people will know that the whole-of-government is working together on the war against illegal drugs.</p>
      <p>The system will only be accessible to authorized users from the various agencies involved in the anti-illegal drugs campaign.</p>
