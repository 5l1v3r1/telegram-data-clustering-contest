      <h1>Premier League team of the weekend as Liverpool pair joined by Leicester duo</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool bolstered their title hopes with a 3-1 win at Anfield, while there were also home wins for Wolves, Burnley, Manchester United, Leicester and Newcastle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:00:14+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Another round of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/premier-league">Premier League</a> fixtures has been and gone, and now we're left staring towards the final international break of 2019 (shudders).</p>
      <p>The top-flight season is now almost a third of the way through, and Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are flying high, a 3-1 win over champions Manchester City on Sunday sending them eight points clear of second place.</p>
      <p>That position is now held by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City, with Brendan Rodgers' men having eased past a bedraggled Arsenal side on Saturday, while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> are third after victory over Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the table, both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> claimed much-needed victories, while <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> , Wolves and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> were also winners.</p>

      <p>Sheffield United are now fifth, after Chris Wilder's side took a point off <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> in the weekend's only draw.</p>
      <p>However, despite an impressive team display from the Blades, none of their star men are in this week's Mirror Football XI.</p>
      <p>With that being said, here's our team of the weekend, ready to shine in a pretty straightforward 4-2-3-1 formation.</p>
      <h3>Nick Pope (Burnley)</h3>
      <p>Nothing spectacular was required from the Clarets No.1 in the comfortable win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>But he made a couple of smart stops, came and made claims to relieve pressure when necessary and looks back to his best. Will hope to rival Jordan Pickford with England now.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h3>Ricardo Pereira (Leicester City)</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese played a decisive role in Leicester's comfortable win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>Pereira, having nailed down a starting spot at right-back this term, defended well against Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang whenever he drifted left and had a hand in both goals; has a knack of finding space in dangerous positions the final third.</p>
      <h3>Kurt Zouma (Chelsea)</h3>
      <p>The Frenchman was challenged by Frank Lampard to make himself first choice and he's done just that in the absence of Antonio Rudiger.</p>
      <p>Zouma had a fine game against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> , enjoying and winning the physical battle with Jordan Ayew, while using his speed - on a number of occasions - to close out Palace runners or help Reece James on Wilf Zaha. Read the game well throughout.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <h3>Ciaran Clark (Newcastle United)</h3>
      <p>The Irishman scored the winner as Steve Bruce's men made it back-to-back victories at home to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> .</p>
      <p>But Clark was tremendous throughout as part of the Magpies' back three, dealing well with Callum Wilson and winning more than his fair share in the air.</p>
      <h3>Andy Robertson (Liverpool)</h3>
      <p>Social media continues to be awash with gifs of Trent Alexander-Arnold pinging balls from right to left, but the best ball at Anfield this weekend came from Liverpool's left-back; the Scot's delivery for Mohamed Salah's header was perfect.</p>
      <p>During the champions vs champions clash, Robertson did well with the ball and was defensively sound, doing well up against Bernardo Silva.</p>

      <h3>Fabinho (Liverpool)</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> man mountain produced a towering performance in the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> .</p>
      <p>Scored a tremendous opening goal from distance, but also provided calm amid the Anfield chaos, defending smartly at the base of midfield and moving the ball to good effect throughout.</p>
      <h3>Ruben Neves (Wolves)</h3>
      <p>The Portuguese playmaker has stepped up in recent weeks, and opened the scoring at Molineux in the West Midlands' derby with a fine effort from 22 yards.</p>
      <p>Was typically calm and smart in possession throughout, as well as making a number of smart interceptions, while a fine, brave, sliding challenge directly led to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> ' second goal.</p>

      <h3>Adama Traore (Wolves)</h3>
      <p>Keeps getting better and better under Nuno Espirito Santo.</p>
      <p>Traore terrorised Aston Villa throughout, hitting double figures for completed dribbles (13/17), and showed composure in teeing up Raul Jimenez for Wolves' killer second goal after a late, lung-bursting 60-yard run.</p>
      <p>It was his eighth assist of the campaign in all competitions.</p>
      <h3>Gerard Deulofeu (Watford)</h3>
      <p>Every so often, the Spaniard shows just why he was once so highly-rated when dancing his way through La Masia; Friday night was one of those occasions.</p>
      <p>From his first touch of the game, which saw him rob Emilio Buendia before racing clear, drop a step over and score, Norwich couldn't get near him.</p>
      <p>He ended the night with a goal and an assist, inspiring the Hornets to a first win of the season.</p>

      <h3>Richarlison (Everton)</h3>
      <p>The Brazilian scored the winner as Marco Silva's Toffees edged past <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> .</p>
      <p>And throughout the Saints had no answer to Richarlison's movement, speed and power, cutting in from the left side and generally wreaking havoc.</p>
      <h3>Jamie Vardy (Leicester)</h3>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers has spoken of channelling Vardy's running for the moments that matter, and this was the perfect example.</p>
      <p>The Premier League's top scorer was a constant threat to the Arsenal defence because he stayed central, sniffing opportunities in behind, rather than chasing across the field to close fullbacks.</p>
      <p>He duly scored one, teed up another, and has the Foxes second at the international break.</p>
