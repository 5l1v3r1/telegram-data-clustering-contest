      <p>Cape Town -<b> Chris Jordan </b>produced a sparkling all-round performance as <b>England </b>secured a <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/england-win-super-over-thriller-to-take-nz-t20-series-20191110">3-2 series victory</a> over<b> New Zealand</b>, with his prior experience in bowling a Super Over against proving vital in the heat of the moment.</p>
      <p>With the situation looking dire at best, Jordan strode out to bat with the unenviable task of requiring 13 runs for victory from just three balls.</p>
      <p>A first-ball six, followed by a sharply-run two and then a four ensured the series-deciding match went to a Super Over to bring a golf ball-sized lump up in New Zealandersâ€™ throats.</p>
      <p>Heavy-hitting from Eoin Morgan and man of the match Jonny Bairstow set a daunting 17-run target for Jordan to defend, which the all-rounder ably achieved, conceding just eight runs while taking the wicket of Tim Seifert.</p>
      <p>Jordan was entrusted with bowling the Super Over when England beat Pakistan in Sharjah four years ago, an experience which the 31-year-old feels relieved the pressure on his shoulders this time around.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he felt Bairstow and Morgan had given him enough to defend, Jordan responded: "It needed to be enough.</p>
      <p>"Drawing on that experience from doing it before helped out.</p>
      <p>"It was a brilliant team performance and even as the game was coming down to the wire I just tried to be as calm as possible and try and see ball, hit ball. It was great to get a series win."</p>
