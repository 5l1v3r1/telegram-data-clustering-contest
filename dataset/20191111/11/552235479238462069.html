      <h1>Stray cat found close to death in Scots street after chemical burn</h1>
      <h2>Three-year-old Taz was found with badly burnt skin and fur.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T11:58:34+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>A stray <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cats">cat</a> has been found close to death in a neighbour's garden after severe chemical burns.</p>
      <p>Three-year-old Taz has been left with badly burnt skin and fur on the front of his body after coming into contact with agricultural chemicals.</p>
      <p>He disappeared for several weeks from a farm and when he turned up in a neighbour’s garden he was in a terrible state. He was rushed to the vets, where he was diagnosed with chemical burns.</p>
      <p>Now the Cats Protection's Lanarkshire Branch is taking care of the moggy and is appealing for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charity">donations</a> towards vet bills.</p>

      <p>Branch co-ordinator Alex Thomson said: “We believe it is likely that he put his head into some kind of agricultural chemicals as he had been spotted on a local farm.</p>
      <p>“Taz has been taken in by one of our fosterers, who has been offering him plenty of TLC, as well as painstakingly applying antibiotic cream to affected areas every day. This has been painful and difficult for him but he has learnt to trust her, and we are starting to see slight improvements.”</p>
      <p>Because of the severity of Taz’s injuries he requires ongoing vet treatment.</p>
      <p>Volunteers at the Lanarkshire Branch of Cats Protection are hoping that fellow cat-lovers will dig deep to donate after seeing Taz’s plight.</p>
      <p>“We don’t often do public appeals but this is a long term and expensive case, but it is worth it as he is the most friendly and affectionate little guy you can imagine, despite his ordeal.”  </p>
      <p>Anyone wishing to donate to Taz’s care should <a href="https://www.cats.org.uk/lanarkshire">visit here</a> and click the donate button.</p>
