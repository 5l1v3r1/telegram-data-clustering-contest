      <p><b>TEHRAN, IranÂ (AP)</b> - Iran on Monday awarded a top prize in the study of science and technology to two U.S.-educated scientists.</p>
      <p>Vice President Sourena Sattari granted the Mustafa award to five scientists, three Iranians and two Turks, during a ceremony.</p>
      <p>Among the recipients was UCLA professor Ali Khademhosseini, for his work on the application of nanostructures in the treatment of disease. Umran Inan, a Turkish professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University, also received the prize.</p>
      <p>Upon granting the awards, Sattari stressed that Iran's achievements came from investing in its young people and not only from its oil revenue.</p>
      <p>It was the third award ceremony for the biennial prize since 2015. Iran launched the prize as part of its goal to become a regional scientific powerhouse.</p>
      <p>This year's prize comes against the backdrop of U.S. sanctions on Tehran and Iran's unraveling nuclear deal with world powers.</p>
      <p>Khademhosseini told The Associated Press he hopes the sanctions will be removed to pave the ground for scientific cooperation.</p>
      <p>"Clearly sanctions made things more difficult," said Khademhossenin." That's something that hopefully over time we can overcome."</p>
      <p>The science and technology $500,000 prize is awarded to Muslim researchers and scientists, regardless of whether they live in Muslim-majority nations or elsewhere, as well as non-Muslim scientists in Muslim countries.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the Turkish-French national, Sami Erol Gelenbe, and Iran's Mohammad Amin Shokrollahi, were honored for their achievements in systems assessment in model-making and computer coding.</p>
      <p>Iran first handed out the prize in 2015 to a Taiwanese-Singaporean nanotechnology researcher Jackie Y. Ying and Jordanian-American chemistry professor Omar Yaghi.</p>
