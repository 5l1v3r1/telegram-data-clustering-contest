        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - Evo Morales, who recently resigned as president of Bolivia, may not be unemployed for long, Sputnik and RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said on Monday, offering Morales his own show at the broadcaster’s Spanish-language channel, citing previous experience with another former South American president-turned-TV presenter.</b>

        <i>"I offer Morales an exciting job as a TV presenter at Spanish RT. [Former President of Ecuador Rafael] Correa has been hosting his show with us for the second year and has nothing to worry about," Simonyan wrote on her Telegram channel.</i>
      </p>
      <p>On Sunday, Morales resigned <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910291077170146-at-least-30-people-injured-in-monday-protests-in-bolivia--reports/">after weeks of protests throughout Bolivia</a> that were sparked by a controversial election, in which Morales won nearly 10 more points than his opponents. His resignation followed the publishing of a report by international observers that found "grave" irregularities in the 20 October vote.</p>
      <p>Correa, for his part, has been hosting his political talk show, "Conversando con Correa," on RT Espanol since early 2018, after serving as president of Ecuador from 2007-2017. Similar to Morales, Correa was part of a leftward shift in South American politics in the 2000s known as the "pink tide."</p>
