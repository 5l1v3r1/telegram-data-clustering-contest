      <h1>Man set on fire in Ma On Shan following apparent argument</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T07:02:17+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 07:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Hong%20Kong" target="_blank">Coconuts Hong Kong</a></address>
      <p>A man was doused in a flammable liquid and set on fire during a what appeared to be argument with protesters on a footbridge in Ma On Shan this afternoon, as citywide protests of uncommon ferocity exploded across the city following the <a href="https://coconuts.co/hongkong/news/at-least-one-protester-shot-with-live-round-as-citywide-boycott-hits-city/">shooting of a protester this morning</a>.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed to <i>Coconuts HK</i> that they had received several reports of the incident just before 1pm. A police representative said that while they had few details as to what led to the attack, reports indicated that the man had been assaulted before being set on fire.</p>
      <p>The representative added that the last update police had received on the case was that firefighters had arrived at the scene of the incident, which took place on a pedestrian bridge on Sai Sha Road.</p>
      <p>While the nature of the apparent dispute remained unclear as of press time, the victim appeared to already be bloody in videos from the scene (warning: the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/chianglaiwan/videos/533697530800416/?v=533697530800416">video</a> is graphic in nature). Voices off camera can be heard shouting “F**k your mom,” and “go back” to the mainland.</p>
      <p>One man can be seen appearing to dab the blood from the victim’s face as the back-and-forth between the middle-aged man and bystanders continued. Suddenly, a person wearing black clothes and a mask splashes a liquid onto the man’s face and upper body, and holds a lighter to the man’s shirt, which immediately goes up in flames.</p>

      <p>The <i>SCMP</i>, meanwhile, reports that the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3037135/shots-fired-hong-kong-anti-government-protesters-cause">man was being treated for second-degree burns</a> over 28 percent of his body, mostly on his arms and torso.</p>
