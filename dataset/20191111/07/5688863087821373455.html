        <b>Indian off-spinner Deepti Sharma once again put up a show proving as to why she’s gold in the T20 format and with the openers, Shafali Verma and Smriti Mandhana, taking charge, the visitors sealed the second game by 10 wickets. India have now taken a 2-0 lead in the five-match T20I series.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Brief scores:</b> WI W 103/7(Chedean Nation 32(36), Deepti Sharma 4/10) lost to IND W 104/0 (Shafali Verma 69*(35), <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/smriti_mandhana">Smriti Mandhana</a> 30* (28))</p>
      <p>West Indies Women skipper Shemaine Campbelle won the toss and opted to bat, but her team failed to materialize on her expectations of a good T20I total. Opener Stacy-Ann King (7 off 9) was dismissed early by Shikha Pandey and starting from then there was no looking back for India. Legspinner Radha Yadav bagged Campbelle’s wicket for a duck and wickets kept tumbling down for the hosts. Right-hander Chedean Nation top-scored with an ordinary 36-ball 32, while opener Hayley Matthews managed 23 runs off 35 deliveries.</p>
      <p>West Indies somehow pushed to a total of 103/7, which would’ve been defendable only with exceptional bowling. But their bowling unit couldn’t even get any one of the Indian openers out. Shafali Verma was outstanding in her undefeated 69 and the support from Smriti steered India to a cruising 10-wicket victory with 9.3 overs to spare. </p>
      <p>The third T20I will be played at the Providence Stadium in Guyana on November 14.</p>
