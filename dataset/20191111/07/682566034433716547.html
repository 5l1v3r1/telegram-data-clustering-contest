      <p>Cape Town - The future of Springbok rugby in the second-row appears to be bright if a picture doing the rounds on social media is anything to go by.</p>

      <p>In the picture, taken during the Springboks' Champions Tour of Gauteng on Thursday, a schoolboy from Helpmekaar Kollege is photographed alongside 2019 Rugby World Cup-winning lock <b>Eben Etzebeth</b>.</p>
      <p>The schoolboy, reported to be in Grade 11 at the Afrikaans private high school in Braamfontein, appears to dwarf Etzebeth, a veteran of 85 Tests in the green and gold.</p>
      <p>Etzebeth stands 2.03m (6-foot-7), while the schoolboy measures 2.09m (6-foot-9) in height.</p>
      <p>It's certainly not often Etzebeth has had to look <b>UP</b> to an opponent on the rugby field!</p>
      <p>RG Snyman at 2.07m is currently the tallest player in the Springbok squad, while in recent times, Andries Bekker, at 2.08m, has looked down on all his team-mates, bar none.</p>
