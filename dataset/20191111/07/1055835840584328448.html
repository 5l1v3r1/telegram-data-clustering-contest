      <p>My ex-husband’s brother and I are happily dating but we’re reluctant to reveal the news to the family... Clinical psychologist Jo Lamble has some expert advice for this week’s Dear Stellar. </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Question 1: I am a female in my senior years who has been single for seven years. I was divorced from my husband in 2001, after a 23-year marriage. He has been in a committed relationship for many years and I had a subsequent 10-year relationship.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>My dilemma is that my ex-husband’s brother (who is also single) has contacted me out of the blue and we’ve begun happily spending time together. But we’re very reluctant to reveal our new relationship to the family.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><b><i>We don’t feel as if we’re doing anything that is wrong, but don’t wish to raise any ill feelings. What is your advice? It’s not much fun sneaking around when you are in your 60s.</i></b> </p>
      <p>How lovely that you have found someone who makes you happy. It’s a pity that there are complications, but life is complicated. </p>
      <p>If you approach the situation with loads of empathy, surely there is a way for you to enjoy this relationship without sneaking around?</p>
      <p>It’s hard to know whether it would be best for you to speak to your ex-husband or for his brother to talk to him. It depends on what kind of relationship you have these days with your ex.</p>
      <p>Whoever speaks to him can begin with acknowledgement that it may be hard for your ex-husband to get his head around this, but you and his brother have formed a connection that you’d like to explore further.</p>

      <p>Allow the information to sink in and empathise with any issues he may have. For example, he might be worried about extended family get-togethers with his new partner. If there are children involved, he may be concerned about their reaction.</p>
      <p>Listen to his concerns and offer to discuss ways to make it as easy as possible for everyone involved. Then I’d suggest giving it a little time for your ex to process the information before slowly outing yourselves to the family.</p>

          <i>Question 2: As parents, we try to be accommodating with our teenage daughters and their needs – phones, driving lessons and practice, part-time jobs.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Yet they seem to want to up the ante and do things in a more “adult” way, such as consuming alcohol, renting houses for birthday parties and other things that frankly scare me.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>What I’m having trouble understanding is – what’s the rush to be doing things adults do? I’m the first to acknowledge the different era I grew up in as opposed to my kids, but even talking to them is difficult as it doesn’t involve a screen they can hide behind. Any advice is appreciated.</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m sure our parents also struggled with raising teenagers in a different era, because so much change happens with each generation.</p>

      <p>But whatever era we’re in, one thing stays the same, and that’s the desire by all parents to do what they think is right for their children. And if some of your daughters’ behaviour scares you, then that’s your gut telling you that you don’t think it’s safe.</p>
      <p>If you go against your gut and give in to them for the sake of short-term peace, then what happens if something goes wrong? It would be hard to live with the thought that you knew that what you’d agreed to was a bad idea.</p>
      <p>We need to model good parenting to our kids. And being their best friend or giving in to pressure is not great modelling.</p>
      <p>It can be so hard, but our kids need to hear us say, “Our job is to try to keep you safe and we don’t think that’s safe. So the answer is no.”</p>
