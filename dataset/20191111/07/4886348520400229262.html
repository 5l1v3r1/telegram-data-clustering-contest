        <i>October 31 was a special day.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Not because of Halloween, no, but because October 31 marked the end of one of the biggest giveaways ever organized on the internet – the <b>FreeBitco.in Golden Ticket </b><a href="https://freebitco.in/site/blogs/bitcoin/lamborghini-giveaway-winner-announced/"><b>Lamborghini Giveaway</b></a>.</p>
      <p>A <b>provably fair </b>draw picked out a lucky name, rather, a lucky User ID out of the millions of users that participated, and the winner is all set to receive a brand new <b>Lamborghini Huracan </b>or <b>21.87 BTC, </b>according to the <a href="https://freebitco.in/site/bitcoin/"><b>Bitcoin Price</b></a> at the time of conclusion of the contest. </p>
      <h3>FreeBitco.in – A Global Brand</h3>
      <p>In 2013, FreeBitco.in was launched as a <a href="https://freebitco.in/site/bitcoin-faucet/"><b>Bitcoin faucet</b></a> (a platform that gives away free crypto in order to promote wider adoption) with a view of getting even more people talking about Bitcoin and a vision of expanding the crypto-community’s worldwide reach.</p>
      <p>6 years on, FreeBitco.in’s reputation speaks for itself. With <b>32 million registered users</b> and over <b>194,000 Bitcoins distributed</b> since its launch, <a href="https://freebitco.in/">FreeBitco.in</a> is the world’s oldest existing Bitcoin faucet and the biggest Bitcoin casino on the internet.</p>
      <p>It owes its immense popularity largely to its provably fair algorithm, which, combined with an unrelenting focus on user-satisfaction, has successfully created a trustless ecosystem for online gamblers everywhere.</p>
      <h3>A “Golden” Opportunity</h3>
      <p>Seeing the growing popularity of the Lambo among crypto-enthusiasts, FreeBitco.in decided to offer its users crypto’s most desired prize – a Lamborghini.</p>
      <p>On May 1, 2019, FreeBitco.in launched the “Golden Ticket” contest, a love letter to the crypto-community that helped it amass a massive user base and become one of the biggest names in Bitcoin gaming.</p>
      <p>All users had to do was play on the website and collect Golden Tickets which would be entered into a lucky draw. Users could even purchase tickets to boost their totals and their chances of winning.</p>
      <p>In the span of 6 months, a whopping <b>5,954,090 tickets </b>were distributed to users all over the globe, all vying for a chance to get their hands on the dream car.</p>
      <p>And on October 31, one of them did.</p>
      <h3>The Lucky Winner</h3>
      <p><b>User 4424669 </b>was crowned the winner of the Golden Ticket contest. The winner has a choice – either a Lamborghini Huracan or $200,000 in BTC, which amounts to 21.87 BTC, deposited directly in their FreeBitco.in wallet.</p>
      <h3>It’s Your Turn</h3>
