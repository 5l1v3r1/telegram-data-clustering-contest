      <p>The chief executive officer of Uber has expressed regret after calling the gruesome killing of Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/jamal-khashoggi.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a> a "mistake" by Saudi Arabia's government and comparing it to a fatal self-driving crash involving one of the ride-hailing firm's cars.</p>
      <p>Dara Khosrowshahi made the remarks during an interview with "Axios on HBO" after being asked about Yasir al-Rumayyan, the director of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, who is a member of Uber's board of directors. The sovereign wealth fund is Uber's fifth-biggest investor.</p>

      <p>"Listen, it's a serious mistake. We've made mistakes too," Khosrowshahi said of Khashoggi's murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, before comparing it to last year's self-driving crash.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, one of Uber's self-driving test vehicles <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/arizona-woman-hit-uber-driving-car-dies-180319181256579.html">struck and killed</a> a female pedestrian in Tempe, in the US state of Arizona. Last week, a US agency <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-crash/uber-test-vehicles-involved-in-37-crashes-before-fatal-self-driving-incident-idUSKBN1XF2HA">said</a> the vehicle had software flaws.</p>
      <p>"We stopped driving, and we're recovering from that mistake. So I think that people make mistakes and it doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they've taken it seriously," he said.</p>

      <p>"I said something in the moment that I do not believe. When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused," said the statement posted on the news website on Monday.</p>
      <h3>Gruesome murder</h3>
      <p>Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor and critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/mohammed-bin-salman.html">Mohammed bin Salman</a>, was murdered by a Saudi hit squad inside the consulate on October 2, 2018. His dismembered body has not been located so far.</p>
      <p>In a report in June, Agnes Callamard, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, said the journalist was the victim of "deliberate, premeditated execution" for which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/saudi-arabia.html">Saudi Arabia</a> bore responsibility.</p>
      <p>The report concluded there was "credible evidence" warranting further investigation of the crown prince's liability for the killing.</p>
      <p>The CIA has reportedly concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the operation to kill Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia has described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.</p>
      <p>After initially offering several contradictory explanations over Khashoggi's fate, Riyadh said amid a global outcry that the journalist was killed and his body dismembered after negotiations to convince him to return to the kingdom failed.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects charged in the case, but has said the crown prince had no prior knowledge of the operation.</p>
