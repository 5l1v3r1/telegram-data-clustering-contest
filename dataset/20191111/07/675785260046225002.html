      <p>A Russian professor was dressed as Napoleon when he drunkenly fell into a river with his lover's severed arms in his backpack, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Oleg Sokolov, 63, has confessed to killing his 24-year-old girlfriend Anastasia Yeschenko and then cutting up her body, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>Ms Yeschenko's head and body were found at her teacher's flat after Sokolov fell into a river while trying to dump her remains.</p>
      <p>The historical re-enactor reportedly intended to kill himself while dressed as Napoleon after disposing of her body.</p>
      <p>It is said the teacher accidentally killed his student after they got into an argument.</p>
      <p>He is now in hospital suffering from hypothermia after being dragged out of St Petersburg's Moyka River on Saturday morning.</p>

      <p>The St Petersburg State University lecturer is renowned for being an expert on the Napoleonic wars, although he was also known for his alcoholism and mood swings, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7670059/Russian-history-expert-63-admits-murdering-young-lover-dismembering-her.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>

      <p>A criminal case for murder has been opened, say law enforcement sources.</p>
      <p>Sokolov was president of the Russian Association of Military History and is now a member of the body’s scientific council.</p>
      <p>He has worked as a technical adviser to European television broadcasters on films depicting the Napoleonic era, and he was made a knight of the Legion of Honour in France in 2003.</p>
