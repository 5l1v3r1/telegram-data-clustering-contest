      <p>KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — A Rwandan opposition leader says she has quit as chief of the political party she founded and is launching a new one.</p>
      <p>Victoire Ingabire says she is leaving the FDU-Inkingi party weeks after police interrogated her over a possible connection to an attack in a popular tourist area near Congo that killed at least 14 people. Police killed 19 assailants.</p>
      <p>Ingabire says she told police she doesn’t believe in armed struggle.</p>
      <p>FDU-Inkingi is part of P5 grouping of political organizations that Rwanda’s government calls a terrorist organization. Earlier this year a United Nations experts report indicated that P5 has a rebel group operating in Congo.</p>
      <p>Ingabire has been barred from contesting elections but says she hopes her new Development And Liberty For All party will be allowed to register.</p>
