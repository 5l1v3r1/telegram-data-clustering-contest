        <b>The Central Crime Branch, on Sunday, arrested an alleged international bookie named Sayyam on the grounds of being involved in the heavily infamous Karnataka Premier League (KPL) spot-fixing scandal. The police arrested him after he flew back to India from the West Indies, on Sunday. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Following a major turn of events, including the arrests of multiple cricketers involved in match-fixing, the police has now put their hands on Sayyam, an international bookie, who had allegedly approached celebrity drummer Bhavesh Bafna to fix the KPL game.</p>
      <p>Sayyam, a resident of Haryana, had fled to West Indies following which a lookout circular was issued, and as soon as he landed back in India, the police arrested him. It was after Sayyam’s approach, that Bafna had allegedly tried to bribe Bellary Tuskers bowler Bhavesh Gulecha. The bowler was asked to concede 10 runs during his over of bowling, but Gulecha had declined and lodged a complaint with the police. That led to the arrest of Bafna and the eventual lookout circular to seize Sayyam.</p>
      <p>Sayyam, who is now in judicial custody, is the seventh arrest in connection with the KPL match-fixing scandal. The series of arrests had started with the owner of the Belagavi <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/pant">Pant</a>hers team, Ali Ashfaq Thara. Cricketers C.M. Gautam and his teammate Abrar Qazi were also arrested last week.</p>
