      <h1>Evans injects dose of reality into Leicester fans’ title dreams</h1>

        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 11 <i>– </i>Three-time Premier League-winning defender Jonny Evans moved to calm rising expectations among Leicester fans that the club can repeat their fairytale title win of 2016, saying the hectic Christmas period will give a more realistic picture.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Northern Irish international — who won his three league winners medals with Manchester United — has played an integral role in the Foxes’ superb form this term under compatriot Brendan Rodgers.</p>
      <p>Their impressive 2-0 win over an out-of-form Arsenal on Saturday lifted them to second in the table, eight points off leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>However, Evans — who joined Leicester from West Bromwich Albion for £3.5 million ($4.5 million) in June last year — is too experienced a head to allow early season form to lull him into believing a genuine title challenge is a cast-iron certainty.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think you’ll be able to judge that until after Christmas when we’re getting into it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We know how seasons can finish. It’ll be tough. We need a big squad to do that, and all firing in the right directions.</p>
      <p>“We’ve shown we can battle games out but we’ve just got to do what we’re doing and see where it takes us.</p>
      <p>“It’s still really early on in the season. If you look at it there’s still teams like Sheffield United sitting fifth. So we know it’s going to be a long season and every team can beat everyone.”</p>
      <p>Evans, capped 83 times, said comparisons should not be drawn between the present team and the one that landed the title having been originally 5,000/1 to do so.</p>
      <p>Were the Foxes to go on and win the league crown this season it would be even more emotional than the previous triumph due to the death in a helicopter crash in October 2018 of their much-loved Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s hard,” said Evans.</p>
      <p>“What they did that year was incredible. I suppose it’s a compliment, really, to be compared to that team.</p>
      <p>“I think teams disrespected Leicester that season, in terms of probably not really realising how good they were, and kept being caught short.</p>
      <p>“After that, teams tried to become aware that they played on the counter-attack and not over-commit.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure teams realise we are a good side and in every game I think we’ve played well, given everyone a test.”</p>
