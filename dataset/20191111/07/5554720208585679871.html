      <h1>Deepak Chahar called ‘shameless’ by teammate Yuzvendra Chahal after historic spell, reveals he was unaware of his hat-trick feat</h1>

      <p>India’s medium-pace bowler Deepak Chahar wreaked havoc against Bangladesh in the final T20 International on Sunday night as he ended the game with a spell of 6-7. Deepak smashed the previous best bowling spell in a T20 International match held by Sri Lanka’s Ajantha Mendis. Soon after the match, Deepak’s teammate Yuzvendra Chahal called him ‘shameless’ while interviewing him for ‘Chahal TV.’</p>

      <p>In a video posted by the BCCI on Twitter, Yuzvendra is seen interviewing Deepak and <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/deepak-chahars-hat-trick-guides-india-to-beat-bangladesh-in-t20i-win-series/272072/">another hero</a> of the Sunday’s match, Shreyas Iyer, who went on to smash a quickfire 62 that included five huge sixes and three boundaries off Afif Hossain’s bowling.</p>
      <p>Yuzvendra started his interview by addressing Deepak, “Chahal TV is back from Nagpur. Brilliant series win. What should I say about bowling. He (Deepak) broke my record today. You are such a shameless man!”</p>
      <p>At this point, Shreyas Iyer interrupted saying that he should get the credit for Deepak’s feat since he had taken a decisive catch of Mustafizur Rahman without which Deepak wouldn’t have created the history in the match. “I should also get the credit for his five-wicket haul since I took that catch,” Shreays said.</p>
      <p>Deepak thanked him for his contribution. “Thank you brother, thank you,” he said while shaking Shreyas’ hand.</p>

      <p>Earlier, Yuzvendra had taken six wickets by conceding 25 runs against England in a T20 International match in 2017.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, India scored 174 runs in 20 overs after they were put to bat by Bangladesh. In response, Bangladesh were bowled out for 144. Deepak’s 6-7 bowling figure also included a <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/deepak-chahar-from-being-rejected-by-greg-chappell-to-becoming-bowler-with-most-impressive-spell-in-t20i-history/272079/">hat-trick</a>, which is the first by any Indian in a T20 International match. Deepak later revealed that he wasn’t aware of his hat-trick until he was told about his teammates.</p>
      <p>With this win, India also won the series 2-1.</p>
