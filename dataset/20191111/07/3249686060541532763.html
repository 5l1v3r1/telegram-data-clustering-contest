      <p>An official statement has been released in defense of the claim that <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/X1">X1 </a>members have yet to receive an income for their work.<br/><br/>On November 11 KST, a representative for one of the agencies involved with X1 members revealed that their situation is actually quite common for debut idols.</p>
      <p><i>"It has only been less than three months since X1 has debuted. Usually, this kind of income is distributed quarterly. It's true that the payment period has still not come,"</i> they stated, adding that the members will be paid after the total earnings from album sales and other activities have been calculated.<br/><br/>The press statement came shortly after one news outlet reported that X1 has <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/11/x1-members-and-label-revealed-to-have-received-0-krw-from-their-activities-up-to-now">not received any income since their debut</a>.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, X1 debuted on August 27 with their debut album '<b>Emergency: Quantum Leap</b>,' which went on to sell more than 500,000 copies within its first week of sales. However, since the arrest of '<b>Produce X 101</b>'s main producer on the count of vote manipulation, they have been the subject of many rumors and exaggerated claims.</p>
