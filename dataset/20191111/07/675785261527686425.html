      <h1>Arsene Wenger makes Premier League title verdict after Liverpool win over Man City</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool ran out 3-1 winners against the Premier League champions on Merseyside on Sunday, thanks to goals from Fabinho, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T07:03:47+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 07:03</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsene-wenger">Arsene Wenger</a> believes Manchester City have left themselves too much to do to retain their Premier League title after defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's men fell to a 3-1 defeat at Anfield in the clash between back-to-back English champions and last season's Champions League winners.</p>
      <p>Fabinho, Mohammed Salah and Sadio Mane all found the net as the Reds claimed victory to continue their unbeaten start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp's men now sit eight points clear of second place <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> City at the top of the table. City sit fourth, a point further back.</p>

      <p>And according to ex-Arsenal chief Wenger, a three-time Premier League winner, that deficit is too large for Guardiola and his side to overcome - even with two-thirds of the season remaining.</p>
      <p>“First of all, to lose a big game, it is terrible and you can see the reactions from both managers [last night], how much pressure they are under and how much a game like that means,” he told <i>BeIN Sports.</i></p>

      <p>“Guardiola will go home and be absolutely devastated, more than you think.</p>
      <p>"If you think of a quantity, add 100 percent to that.</p>
      <p>"Overall, nine points is too big a difference for Man City after 12 games.”</p>

      <p>Reds boss Klopp insists that, in stark contrast to what Wenger says about his Etihad counterpart, his side are not feeling any pressure in their bid to end a 30-year title wait.</p>
      <p>“We don't feel any pressure, to be honest - if you are with us, then nine points is a positive," said the German post-game.</p>
      <p>“Other people will 100 percent say, and have said already, that from now on Liverpool can only lose it.</p>
      <p>“That's a very negative approach, but I can promise you that we don't care.</p>
      <p>"Nine points ahead of City, you cannot imagine that something like this would happen.</p>
      <p>"But it's not important because who wants to be first in November? You want to be first in May."</p>
