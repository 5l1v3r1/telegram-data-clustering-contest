      <h1>Hong Kong police say man set alight after arguing with democracy protesters</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong police on Monday said a man was set alight following a heated argument with pro-democracy protesters during a day of widespread clashes across the city, as videos of the brutal attack went viral online.</p>
      <p>Three videos were posted on messaging channels used by protesters showing a man in a green T-shirt arguing with people on a footbridge.</p>
      <p>A masked man dressed in black then throws a liquid over the man and sets him ablaze as crowds scatter and the victim frantically tries to remove his T-shirt.</p>
      <p>“In the most shocking incident, some rioters poured flammable liquid onto a person and set him on fire,” police spokesman John Tse told reporters at a press conference as the social media videos of the attack were played on a screen.</p>
      <p>“The man has been admitted to hospital in critical condition.”</p>
      <p>The incident took place in the northern area of Ma On Shan, around 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the central business district, he said.</p>
      <p>It came during a tense day in Hong Kong, which has been engulfed for more than five months by increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.</p>
      <p>Tse said shortly before the attack, masked protesters had trashed the nearby Ma On Shan train station and investigators believe the man “chased the rioters”.</p>
      <p>“Afterwards he was beaten up and set on fire,” Tse said.</p>
      <p>A hospital authority spokeswoman said a man with burns had been admitted to Prince of Wales Hospital, the closest facility to Ma On Shan.</p>
      <p>The videos have not been verified by AFP, but the footage was quickly picked up by Chinese state media.</p>
      <p>The Global Times tabloid uploaded one of the clips to Twitter — a platform banned on the mainland — with the caption: “Black-clad rioters in #HongKong set a resident on fire in Ma On Shan on Monday, Hong Kong police confirmed with the Global Times.”</p>
      <p>“Black-clad rioters” is a phrase commonly used by Chinese media to describe democracy protesters.</p>
      <p>What sparked the argument is unclear, but the expletive-laden conversation shows the man in green criticising people sympathetic to Hong Kong’s democracy movement, and his opponents berating him back.</p>
      <p>At one point the man in green can be heard saying “none of you are Chinese”.</p>
      <p>One of his opponents shouts “Go back to the Greater Bay Area”, the name for a nearby region of the Chinese mainland across the border from Hong Kong.</p>
