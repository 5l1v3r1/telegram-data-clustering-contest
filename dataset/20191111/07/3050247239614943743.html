      <h3>Bitcoin tests high $8Ks support</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 shows BTC/USD reembracing the $8,000 zone after spending much of Sunday evening higher, reaching <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-gains-above-91k-as-ether-looks-to-rally-to-285">around $9,100</a>. </p>
      <p>At press time, the pair had just said a new three-day low of $8,695, subsequently bouncing slightly higher towards $8,800. Bitcoin has languished around that price since Nov. 8, having previously fallen from a range between $9,000 and $9,500.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite the drop, however, analysts appeared neither surprised nor bearish about the overall trend. </p>
      <p>In a Twitter update on Monday, the popular account known as <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoBull/status/1193788581120237568">Crypto Bull</a> highlighted the fact that a dip to current levels represented previous resistance now acting as support. </p>
      <p>“Just testing that support again,” he told followers, referencing Bitcoin’s dramatic run-up from $7,400 to over $10,500 from Oct. 26. </p>
      <p>Others, such as regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a>, had previously said a breakout from range-bound trading between $9,000 and $9,500 was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-steady-above-92k-as-volatility-collapse-predicts-big-move">long overdue</a>. </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-gains-above-91k-as-ether-looks-to-rally-to-285">reported</a>, attention should now focus on the Moving Average Divergence Convergence, or MACD indicator, which could potentially point the way to a bullish move in the coming several weeks. </p>
      <h3>Altcoins stationery as BTC wavers</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoins</a> meanwhile broadly followed Bitcoin’s modest price drop on Monday, with most major tokens seeing losses of around 1%.</p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin by market cap, fell by 0.6% to just under $186. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Others stayed similarly static, with the except of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index">XRP</a>, which lost 1.6%, and Bitcoin SV (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-sv">BSV</a>), 3% lower. </p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $240.9 billion at press time, with Bitcoin’s share totaling 66.1%.</p>
