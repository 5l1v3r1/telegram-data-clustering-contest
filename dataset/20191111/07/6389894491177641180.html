      <p>British Steel is poised to announce a £70m rescue deal with Chinese giant Jingye Group today in a move that could save 4,000 UK jobs.</p>
      <p>Jingye Group has agreed in principle to a £70m sum to buy British Steel, it is reported, which has been in liquidation since May.</p>

      <p>The company contributes a third of UK steel production, and lobby group UK Steel’s director general, Gareth Stace, called the firm “a significant asset to our country”.</p>
      <p>He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We know that a purchase by Jingye of British Steel would certainly complement what they do there in China.</p>
      <p>“They both make wire rod, but actually British Steel makes rail, high-quality rail and heavy sections, ie girders which Jingye doesn’t make.</p>
      <p>“[The acquisition] not only increases the amount of different products that Jingye could make but also, much more importantly, secures a foothold in the UK.”</p>
      <p>Jingye reportedly plans to up production from 2.5m tonnes of steel a year to 3m at British Steel’s Scunthorpe factory. But it has warned it may need to cut costs, with the government running the firm at a loss since it collapsed in May.</p>
      <p>British Steel looked to have a buyer secure in Turkey’s Ataer, which signed a preliminary agreement to buy the company back in August.</p>
      <p>However, the parties failed to agree terms and the offer unravelled.</p>
      <p>Stace said Jingye is prepared to invest heavily in British Steel’s Scunthorpe site.</p>
      <p>“Jingye are looking to make significant investment, are in for the longer term and therefore it isn’t about keeping this site going for a year or two or a couple of years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“To me, what I understand about the company, it’s about looking to the future, so we’re not going to be back in here in three years, five years, in 10 years’ time.”</p>
      <p>The Chinese firm will be able to use a £30m taxpayer-funded support package if it buys the firm, according to the Sunday Telegraph.</p>
      <p>But if an agreement is reached today, weeks of negotiations would continue, according to reports.</p>
      <p>British Steel’s previous owner, Greybull Capital, abandoned it in May as it said fears around Brexit had killed demand.</p>
