      <p>Liverpool - <b>Liverpool</b> boss <b>Jurgen Klopp</b> hailed his side's "incredible goals" after they beat <b>Manchester City</b> 3-1 on Sunday to move nine points clear of the defending Premier League champions.</p>
      <p>The European champions took a huge step towards a first top-flight title in 30 years by opening an eight-point lead at the top of the table, with Leicester City in second place.</p>
      <p>Goals from Fabinho and Mohamed Salah gave Liverpool a dream start before Sadio Mane's diving header early in the second half sealed City's fate.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva pulled a late goal back but a third defeat in eight league games leaves City down in fourth, nine points behind Liverpool, and with a mountain to climb if they are to claim a third straight league title.</p>
      <p>"They (City) were good," Klopp told the BBC. "Oh they were good and we had to defend with all we had but we scored incredible goals.</p>
      <p>"It was so tough to play, the intensity of the game was so clear. It was all worth it, really great."</p>
      <p>"The boys were completely focused and concentrated," he added. "It was so good. It is the only way we can beat City. Maybe other teams can do it a different way but this is the only way we can beat them."</p>
      <p>City boss Pep Guardiola said his side had shown why they were Premier League champions.</p>
      <p>"What happened today we showed why are champion," Guardiola told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"I am so proud of my team, more than ever. We can be proud of how we played against the strongest team in Europe."</p>
      <p>"We played like back-to-back champions," he added. "We cannot deny how good Liverpool are but the way we played, the personality, it was good."</p>
