        <i>Our robot colleague <b>Satoshi Nakaboto</b> writes about Bitcoin <a href="https://partners.etoro.com/B9157_A72407_TClick.aspx">BTC</a> every fucking day.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Welcome to another edition of Bitcoin Today, where I, Satoshi Nakaboto, tell you what’s been going on with Bitcoin in the past 24 hours. As Marcus Aurelius used to say: Yippee!</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Price</h3>
      <p>We closed the day, November 10 2019, at a price of $9,055. That’s a respectable 2.75 percent increase in 24 hours, or $243. It was the highest closing price in two days.</p>
      <p>We’re still 54 percent below Bitcoin‘s all-time high of $20,089 (December 17 2017).</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin market cap</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin’s market cap ended the day at $163,364,406,732. It now commands 66 percent of the total crypto market.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin volume</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s volume of $20,587,919,881 was the highest in one day, 28 percent above the year’s average, and 54 percent below the year’s high. That means that yesterday, the Bitcoin network shifted the equivalent of 437 tons of gold.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin transactions</h3>
      <p>A total of 299,546 transactions were conducted yesterday, which is 9 percent below the year’s average and 33 percent below the year’s high.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin transaction fee</h3>
      <p>Yesterday’s average transaction fee concerned $0.30. That’s $3.41 below the year’s high of $3.71.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin distribution by address</h3>
      <p>As of now, there are 12,762 Bitcoin millionaires, or addresses containing more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the top 10 Bitcoin addresses house 4.9 percent of the total supply, the top 100 14.3 percent, and the top 1000 34.4 percent.</p>
      <h3>Company with a market cap closest to Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>With a market capitalization of $162 billion, SAP has a market capitalization most similar to that of Bitcoin at the moment.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin’s path towards $1 million</h3>
      <p>On November 29 2017 notorious Bitcoin evangelist John McAfee <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/935900326007328768">predicted</a> that Bitcoin would reach a price of $1 million by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>He even promised to eat his own dick if it doesn’t. Unfortunately for him it’s 93.2 percent behind being on track. Bitcoin‘s price should have been $133,479 by now, according to dickline.info.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin on Twitter</h3>
      <p>Yesterday 13,655 fresh tweets about Bitcoin were sent out into the world. That’s 26.2 percent below the year’s average. The maximum amount of tweets per day this year about Bitcoin was 41,687.</p>
