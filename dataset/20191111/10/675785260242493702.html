      <h1>Gary Neville disappointed by Pep Guardiola before Man City's defeat by Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are struggling with injuries at the moment and lined up in the exact way they were predicted to in their defeat by Liverpool on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:00:25+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville says he felt let down by Pep Guardiola's failure to spring a surprise on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> with his team selection.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> are struggling with injuries at the moment, and it was predicted that Claudio Bravo would start in goal in place of Ederson and Fernandinho would slot in at centre-back.</p>
      <p>Neville says he hoped that Guardiola - the tactical genius he is - would try something unexpected at Anfield, in a bid to unsettle Jurgen Klopp's swashbuckling Reds.</p>
      <p>But the Spaniard's team lined up exactly the way they were expected to, and were, subsequently, blown away by Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11859094/listen-gary-neville-podcast">Sky Sports' The Gary Neville Podcast,</a> the former Manchesrer United right-back said: "They were in the corner, they were getting punched.</p>

      <p>"Everyone thought Liverpool would win, everyone though this was the moment; City haven't got the defenders, Claudio Bravo in net.</p>
      <p>"This is when the great teams somehow muster a performance, go in and turn it on its head. And I just had the feeling that Pep Guardiola would have been thinking about this game for the last two or three weeks.</p>
      <p>"And I just felt Pep Guardiola would have something different for us, something unique. Something that we've come to expect from him over the last five, 10, 15 years.</p>

      <p>"And I got what was normal, what I expected. The team the newspapers and us picked in the morning. Fernandinho and [John] Stones at centre-back.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">"Manchester City</a> played well in the game from a football point of view. But that back four and that goalkeeper were never going to be able to cope with this ground.</p>
      <p>"Forget this team, these strikers, this ground. You have to have a toughness, an authority to come and play here, itâ€™s the toughest of places - and Man City didn't have that in defence today.</p>

      <p>"Whether [Nicolas] Otamendi, [John] Stones and [Kyle] Walker as a back three would have fared better, with wing-backs, whether they could have gone with something completely bizarre and turned it on it's head.</p>
      <p>"That's what I've come to expect from Pep: innovative, creative, something that just shocks you like you wouldn't believe. And even if it doesn't come off you think 'well at least he tried to something'. But I didn't think it was very Pep-like."</p>
