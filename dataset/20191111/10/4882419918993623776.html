      <h1>Griezmann has the chance to recover his smile while on France duty</h1>
      <h2>The striker has scored four times for Barcelona but hasn't yet taken off</h2>

      <p>If the international break is going to do any player any good, it's Barcelona's France forward Antoine Griezmann, who hasn't had the greatest start to life at Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Griezmann works hard, fights and gives his all, but the goals have dried up. It's been weeks since his last strike, which was against Eibar. In total, he has scored four goals since his summer move from Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has been sad with how recent games have gone for his club but he now has a chance to rediscover his touch in front of goal. He has been called up by Didier Deschamps for games against Moldova and Albania, opponents who, in theory, he will get chances against and could recover his confidence.</p>
      <p>Remember that against Celta Vigo on Saturday, despite not being able to score, Griezmann did have a good chance after linking well with Lionel Messi, the hat-trick hero on the night. Shoots of encouragement in his adaption at Camp Nou.</p>
