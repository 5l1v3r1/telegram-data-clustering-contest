      <h1>Australian citizen jailed in Vietnam for 'terrorism'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:55:21+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.afp.com/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Vietnam jailed a dissident with Australian citizenship for 12 years Monday on terrorism charges, his lawyer told AFP, in the one-party state where anti-government criticism is routinely quashed.</p>
      <p>Chau Van Kham, who fought against the communists during the Vietnam War, belongs to the outlawed Viet Tan group and was in Vietnam for a fact-finding mission when he was arrested in January.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old was jailed for "terrorism against the People's Administration" and will be deported after he serves his sentence, his lawyer Trinh Vinh Phuc told AFP.</p>
      <p>Kham was jailed alongside Nguyen Van Vien, who got 11 years, and Tran Van Quyen who was sentenced to 10 years, both on the same charges.</p>
      <p>"In court Kham said he did not conduct any terrorist acts, his activities were peaceful," Phuc told AFP after the one-day trial in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
      <p>"Twelve years is too high," Phuc said, adding that Kham had hoped for a sentence of less than 10 years.</p>
      <p>His son told AFP he was "shocked" by the verdict, which could see his father remain in jail until he is over 80 if his appeal is not successful.</p>
      <p>"It's the worst possible outcome," Dennis Chau told AFP from Britain, where he lives.</p>
      <p>Kham and Vien were arrested on January 13 in Ho Chi Minh City, two days after Kham entered Vietnam overland via Cambodia.</p>
      <p>He was in the country to conduct human rights research and meet with activist and civil society contacts, Viet Tan told AFP.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors accused him of giving money to Vien and spreading information about Viet Tan in Vietnam, according to state media.</p>
      <p>- Banned group -</p>
      <p>Kham has been a member of the banned anti-government Viet Tan group since 2010.</p>
      <p>It is run by members who are mostly overseas since Hanoi designated it a terrorist organisation in 2016, accusing it of "instigating violence".</p>
      <p>Viet Tan denies the claim and says it "advocates for social justice and democratic change through peaceful means".</p>
      <p>The group called for the men to be released immediately.</p>
      <p>"We challenge the Vietnamese government to provide any evidence linking them to 'terrorism'," Viet Tan said in a statement Monday, accusing Vietnam of "criminalising human rights advocacy".</p>
      <p>Kham is a former Navy serviceman who fought on the side of the south during the Vietnam War, fleeing on a boat in 1983 after the fall of Saigon -- now called Ho Chi Minh City -- and eventually settling in Australia, where his wife and another son now live.</p>
      <p>His co-defendant Vien belongs to the Brotherhood for Democracy group and was a Facebook friend of Kham.</p>
      <p>Quyen was accused of making fake IDs for Viet Tan members, but the group says it has no association with him.</p>
      <p>Communist Vietnam frequently jails its critics, and a conservative regime in power since 2016 has cracked down on activists in the one-party state.</p>
      <p>Scores are currently behind bars, an increasing number for posting on Facebook since a controversial cybersecurity law was passed last year.</p>
