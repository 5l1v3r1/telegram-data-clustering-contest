      <p>Neymar's father has come out to speak about the rumours which continue to link his son with a move to Barcelona after he failed to secure a move back to Camp Nou in the summer.</p>
      <p>In a report by ESPN Brasil, Neymar Sr says that doesn't have any plans to move to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>"I am in Brazil and I'm not going to move from here," commented Neymar's father, denying that he could soon fly to Spain to negotiate with the Catalan side once again.</p>
      <p>What's more, he insisted that Neymar will continue at Paris Saint-Germain, where he's still sidelined with an injury: "There's no plan to travel to Barcelona."</p>
      <p>Neymar is currently focused on his recovery from injury with the aim of returning for PSG after the international break. He was injured during the last international break playing for Brazil against Nigeria.</p>
