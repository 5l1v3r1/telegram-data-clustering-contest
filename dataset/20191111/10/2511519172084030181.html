      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/StellaMcCartney">Stella McCartney</a> has been criticised for sharing an Instagram post about the coat worn by the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/duchess-of-sussex">Duchess of Sussex</a> for the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/remembrance-sunday">Remembrance Day</a> service.</p>
      <p>On Sunday 10 November, the Duchess joined other members of the royal family at the Cenotaph war memorial in London to pay her respects to those who have lost their lives in conflict.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/meghan-markle">Meghan</a> stood on a balcony with the Countess of Wessex and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence as her husband, Prince Harry, joined Prince William and Prince Charles in laying commemorative wreaths.</p>
      <p>McCartney shared a photograph on Instagram of the duchess taken during the ceremony, saying that she felt “honoured” that the royal wore her eponymous label’s autumn 2019 coat for the occasion.</p>
      <p>While several Instagram users praised McCartney on her design and Meghan on her style, others found the designer’s promotion of her garment on Remembrance Sunday disrespectful.</p>

      <p>“Remembrance Day is to honour those that fought for us not to use for advertising purposes. Pretty shocked,” one person wrote.</p>
      <p>“Nice – but not really a time to be advertising your clothes Stella!!” another Instagram user remarked.</p>
      <p>“Using Remembrance Day to advertise your clothes is a little disrespectful! People died and you take pictures of people showing respect for advertising purposes. Just wrong.” </p>
      <p>Another person stated that they found the post “extremely tacky”, while someone else said they felt “really surprised, shocked, saddened and disappointed” by McCartney’s post.</p>
      <p>“Today is about those who gave their lives for our freedom. Who gives a f*** what she’s wearing,” a critic stated.</p>
      <p>Prior to her post about the duchess, McCartney shared a video of poppies in a field in tribute to Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Remembering the ones that sacrificed to give us freedom,” the fashion designer wrote in the caption.</p>
