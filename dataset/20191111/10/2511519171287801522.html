      <p>Young <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Broadway">Broadway</a> star Laurel Griggs has died aged just 13.</p>
      <p>The actor, who appeared in a 2013 Broadway production of <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> and an adaptation of Irish film <i>Once</i>, suffered what her grandfather called a "massive asthma attack".</p>
      <p>David Rivlin described Griggs as "a child that everybody would dream to have," adding: “She was a brilliant girl, could run a role and never forget a line, and I never heard a complaint. I’m going to miss her.”</p>
      <p>Griggs died on Tuesday (6 November) after paramedics were called to an East Harlem residence to help a girl who was having difficulty breathing.</p>
      <p>She died after being brought to the hospital. An <a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/obituaries/new-york-ny/laurel-griggs-8917364">obituary</a> posted on the website of Riverside Memorial Chapel reveals that her funeral was held days later on Friday (9 November).</p>
      <p>The obituary includes a link for donations towards nonprofit Aids fundraising organisation Broadway Cares, which seeks to help US citizens receive medication, health care and emergency financial assistance.</p>
      <p>Griggs, who was born in 2006, starred in <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i> opposite <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/avengers-endgame-character-ranking-mcu-best-worst-captain-marvel-iron-man-release-date-a8876516.html"><i>Avengers</i></a> star Scarlett Johansson when she was six-years-old.</p>
