      <p>Last week, it was reported that Wolverhampton Wanderers winger <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/african-football/former-fc-barcelona-starlet-chooses-mali-over-spain/666958">Adama Traore had decided he was going to play for Mali</a>, having previously only represented Spain at age-group level.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who qualifies to play for the African country through his family, was called up to play for Mali back in 2014, but chose not to switch his allegiance at that stage.</p>
