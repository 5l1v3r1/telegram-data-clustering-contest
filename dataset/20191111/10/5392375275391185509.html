      <p>For a couple of years, LCD large display panels dominate the market probably because its cheaper and easy to handle. However, all that seems to be changing now. With the consistent need for innovation, the cost of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/amoled-panels">AMOLED panels</a> is no longer a concern and this is proving harmful for LCD display panels. Recent reports claim that between 2020 to 2024, global large-size LCD panel shipments will decline at a negative compound annual growth rate of 0.8%.</p>

      <p>This decline is a result of the preponderance of monitors, tablets, notebooks and 9-inch and above displays. In addition, the sale of small and medium-sized LCD panel shipments will reach 1.8 billion in 2024. It will have a compound annual growth rate of 4.4% from 2019 to 2024.</p>
      <p>As AMOLED panels become more popular in mobile applications, more manufacturers will probably use AMOLED panels in their smartphones.  This will further reduce the need for LCD panels. By 2024, half of the world’s mobile phone shipments will be equipped with AMOLED panels. Certainly, the other half will use LCD panels.</p>
      <p>At present, Samsung is the world’s largest supplier of OLED smartphone screens, accounting for nearly <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/07/19/samsung-amoled-panel-share-falls-below-90-for-the-first-time-ever/">90% of the total market</a>. Most of the smartphones on the market have already switched to the embrace of OLED. Some months ago, it was officially <a href="https://www.anzhuo.cn/news/p_35572">reported</a> that Samsung Display, a Samsung Electronics company, started cutting the production of LCD panels. It plans to close its production capacity of 90,000 LCDs per month.</p>
