      <h1>BatteryGuru helps you track usage and optimize battery health for longevity</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:04:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/aamirsiddiqui/" target="_blank">Aamir Siddiqui</a></address>
      <p>Practically all smartphones these days come with non-removable batteries and some form of fast charging technology. Unless done properly with adequate heat management, charging and fast charging do degrade the life of your phone’s battery, and non-removable batteries make it difficult to swap out an older degraded battery for a new one. Glass sandwich designs further complicate the swapping process, often cracking either the front or the back glass if you are not experienced enough. In these situations, it becomes really important to maintain the health of your battery, especially if you <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/its-settled-the-oneplus-one-has-stood-the-test-of-time/">plan to use your phone for more than 2 years</a>. BatteryGuru attempts to help you in this endeavor.</p>

      <p>The main info screen on BatteryGuru has sections to show different charging statistics, like charge/discharge percentage, estimated time for full charge/discharge, info on deep sleep and more. The “Protection” section is where users can set reminders for charging limits and battery temperature, which is what will directly affect how long your phone’s battery will last. You can tweak the settings to be more aggressive or laidback, depending on your needs and expectations. The “Health” section contains information and tips for battery longevity, while the “Save” section toggles different hardware settings to save battery.</p>
      <p>BatteryGuru doesn’t require root, and the developer assures that it also does not access any sensitive information, and it will not show false info to the user. The app is free and can be <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paget96.batteryguru">downloaded from the Play Store</a>.</p>
