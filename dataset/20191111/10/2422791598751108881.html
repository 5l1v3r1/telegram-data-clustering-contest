      <p>BRUSSELS -- The European Union is extending sanctions against Venezuela for a year due to the political and economic crisis that it blames on the government of President Nicolas Maduro.</p>
      <p>EU foreign ministers decided at a meeting on Monday to prolong an arms embargo and ban on equipment sales that could be used against demonstrators until Nov. 14, 2020.</p>
      <p>They also extended an asset freeze and travel bans against 25 Venezuelan officials.</p>
      <p>The EU says it's targeting the Maduro regime over "persistent actions undermining democracy, the rule of law and the respect for human rights."</p>
      <p>The ministers say the sanctions "are flexible and reversible" and do not target ordinary Venezuelans.</p>
      <p>The U.S., EU and many other governments recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president. They say Maduro wasn't legitimately re-elected last year.</p>
