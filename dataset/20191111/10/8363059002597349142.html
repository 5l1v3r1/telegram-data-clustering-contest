      <h1>Lego Unveils One of its Black Friday 2019 Promos</h1>

      <p>It's no secret we're fans of both <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/tag/lego/">Lego</a> and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/tag/lego/">Black Friday</a> here at Giz UK, so when the two come together we break out the party hats and put the champagne on ice. Last year, it saw <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/11/legos-just-kicked-off-its-first-day-of-black-friday-sales-with-20-off-lots-of-sets/">Lego knocking 20 per cent off many of its best sets</a> and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/11/smyths-has-knocked-100-off-legos-enormous-ucs-millennium-falcon-all-thanks-to-black-friday/">Smyths taking £100 off the Lego Millennium Falcon</a>.</p>
      <p>This year, Lego fans in the US will be treated to a generous range of free stuff, provided of course they first hand over a thick wodge of cash, with a <a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/free-lego-40338-christmas-tree-for-black-friday-2019/">Christmas Tree</a> going to anybody who spends over $120 and a Mini Surfer Van set, including a micro van build, surf board and surfer minifigure, for fans who shell out more than $50 in-store. The offers will be available from 29th November until 1st December (i.e. the Black Friday weekend). It's likely the same deal will roll out over here, but it's not been confirmed yet.</p>
      <p>So far in the UK, Lego fans can get their grubby mitts on a <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/10/lego-polybag-reindeer-promotion/">free polybag reindeer with orders of £35 or more</a> until this Sunday (17th). Not much has been revealed yet about what deals we can expect during this <s>vile American import</s> vital landmark in the holiday shopping season. The Lego Store calendar is promising deals and exclusive offers over the Black Friday weekend, but so far there are no specifics. Once the details emerge, we'll be sure to let you know, but in the meantime Lego VIP members can pick up double points if they fancy buying the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/arendelle-castle-village-41167">Lego Disney Arendelle Castle Village</a> (from Frozen) or a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/disney-train-and-station-71044">Disney Train and Station set</a> online. [<a href="https://www.brickfanatics.com/another-lego-black-friday-2019-promotion-revealed/">Brick Fanatics</a>]</p>
