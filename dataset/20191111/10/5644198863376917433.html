      <p>He allegedly rode his e-scooter at a speed of at least 26kmh to 28kmh while approaching an intersection and colliding with Mdm Ong at about 10.25pm on Sep 21.</p>
      <p>According to charge sheets, his e-scooter weighed 44.2kg and had a 725mm-long handle bar, in contravention of the Active Mobility Act.</p>
      <p>He was released on bail of S$15,000, and the judge adjourned the case to Nov 25.</p>
      <p>Mdm Ong was taken unconscious to Changi General Hospital after the collision and died in hospital four days later. Her sister said at the wake that Madam Ong had suffered a brain injury and was placed on life support.</p>
      <p>The Land Transport Authority subsequently said that <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/bedok-escooter-accident-elderly-woman-pmd-non-compliant-lta-11946214">Hung's device was non-compliant</a> and should not have been used on public paths as it exceeded the prescribed weight and width limit.</p>
      <p>E-scooters were <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/e-scooters-banned-footpaths-fines-jail-pcn-bicycles-12060932">banned from footpaths in Singapore</a> from Nov 5, with offenders facing fines of up to S$2,000 and jail of up to three months once the ban is enforced from 2020.</p>
      <p>If found guilty of causing a person's death by a rash act not amounting to culpable homicide, Hung can be jailed for up to five years, fined, or both.</p>
      <p>For riding a non-compliant personal mobility device (PMD), he could be jailed for up to three months, fined a maximum S$5,000, or both.</p>
