      <h2>Long-serving Wolverhampton city councillor is unable to attend meetings and is granted special dispensation by Labour colleagues on the grounds of his ill health</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:31:05+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:31</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Sweeney, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/joe-sweeney/</a></address>
      <p>One of Wolverhampton's longest-serving councillors has been granted special dispensation from attending committee meetings on the grounds of ill health, his colleagues agreed.</p>
      <p>Councillor John Rowley (Lab. Blakenhall), who was first elected to the council in 1982, but has been unable to attend meetings and functions since May 15 this year - sending apologies for medical reasons.</p>
      <p>A meeting of the full city council agreed the move unanimously. It will be recognised until May 2020.</p>
      <p>Moving the recommendation, Leader of the Council, Cllr Ian Brookfield (Lab. Fallings Park), said: "I'm sure I speak for everyone on the council in sending our very best wishes to Cllr John Rowley and his wife Judith."</p>

      <p>Leader of the opposition, Cllr Wendy Thompson (Con. Tettenhall Wightwick), who seconded the resolution, added: "We are all in full agreement of this resolution. And we certainly join everyone else in sending our very best wishes to Cllr Rowley and Judith in very difficult circumstances."</p>
      <p>Cllr Rowley, who worked as a college lecturer, served the council alongside his wife, Judith, who was also a Labour representative for the Blakenhall ward for 23 years. He was de-selected from his seat in 2016 but later regained it.</p>
      <p>His main interests are planning, the environment and community safety. Cllr Rowley is also a Justice of the Peace on the Walsall Bench.</p>
      <p>In a report to members, the council's Democratic Services Manager, Jaswinder Kaur, said: "Unfortunately, Cllr Rowley has been unable to attend any council meetings, committees or other outside bodies on which he represents the authority.</p>
      <p>"If a member of the local authority (LA) fails to attend any meetings for a period of six months consecutively, then they will cease to be a member - unless the absence has been approved by the council within that time frame."</p>
