      <p>KUWAIT CITY: Hundreds of workers at Kuwait’s international airport held a one-hour strike Monday to demand better working conditions, threatening to stage longer walkouts in the coming days.<br/>Ahmed Mohammed Al-Kandari, a union representative, said workers were calling for improved treatment and to be compensated for daily exposure to pollution and noise.<br/>Monday’s strike by Kuwaiti staff did not affect flights, officials said.<br/>The right to strike is guaranteed for citizens in Kuwait, but such actions remain rare in the Gulf country.<br/>Foreign workers do not have the right to strike.<br/>“Airport traffic is very normal,” Sheikh Salman Al-Hamoud Al-Sabah, head of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation, said.<br/>Another official, Saleh Al-Fadaghi, the airport’s director of operations, also said flights were not affected.<br/>“During the one-hour strike, 19 flights were operated as scheduled. There were five departures and 14 arrivals,” he said.<br/>Kandari said the purpose of the strike was not to disrupt operations but “to make our voices heard.”<br/>He added that Kuwaiti workers would hold a further two-hour strike on Wednesday and a 24-hour strike on Sunday if their demands are not met.<br/>Of 4,500 civil aviation employees, 1,500 took part in Monday’s strike, he said.</p>
