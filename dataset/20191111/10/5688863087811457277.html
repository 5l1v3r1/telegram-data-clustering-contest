        <b>Kieron Pollard has always been known for his wittiness and cunning tricks, and today, against Afghanistan, the Windies captain produced the mother of all tricks. After hearing a loud call of ‘no-ball’ from the umpire, Pollard stopped abruptly, prompting the umpire to instead call it a dead-ball.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Be it by indulging in fights or by involving in banter with the opposition players, Windies skipper <a href="https://sportscafe.in/cricket/player/kieron_pollard">Kieron Pollard</a> always finds a way to make the headlines purely through his antics. His sense of humour on the field is certainly next to none and one particular incident in the IPL a few years ago, where he taped his mouth in order to avoid getting fined for sledging, is amongst the funniest incidents to have happened on a cricket field.</p>
      <p>However, today, Pollard arguably outdid himself with his ‘cunningness’, which left the on-field umpire in stitches, almost embarrassed. The Windies skipper, in an attempt to break a budding partnership between Asghar Afghan and Najibullah Zadran,  brought himself into the attack in the 25th over of the game. </p>
      <p>After finishing his usual routine of warm-up and stretches, Pollard ran - or rather, jogged - towards the wicket to deliver his medium pace to the right-handed Afghan. But as Pollard was about to deliver the ball, he overstepped and this prompted the on-field umpire to give a very loud shout of “NO”. </p>
      <p>After this, you might have guessed that the batsman would have sensed it and tried to take advantage of the early call, but no. This is where Pollard’s intelligence kicks in. As soon as Pollard heard the loud “NO” call from the umpire, he restrained himself from delivering the ball and abruptly stopped his run-up. In turn, what this meant was that the on-field umpire Ahmed Shah Durrani had to instead call it a ‘dead ball’, for the basic fact that it was not delivered in the first place. </p>
      <p>The batsman, umpire and the commentators soon realized what Pollard had just done and this in turn brought about a huge smile on the face of Durrani, who almost gave Pollard the “You got me” look. Through his wittiness and his game awareness, Pollard successfully converted a no-ball into a dead ball. Never change, Kieron Pollard!  </p>
