      <h1>Real Estate Magnate Sells New York Condo for $15.3M in Bitcoin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:01:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Real estate tycoon Ben Shaoul has sold a retail condo in Manhattan’s prestigious Upper East Side for $15.3 million in Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>). The news was <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2019/11/01/ben-shaoul-uses-bitcoin-to-sell-retail-condo-for-15m/">reported</a> by New York real estate magazine The Real Deal on Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>Shaoul — who is president of the Magnum Real Estate Group — sold the 11,400-square-foot property to a Taiwan-based entity “Affluent International LCC,” according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>
      <h3>Luxury properties increasingly bought and sold for BTC</h3>
      <p>While Shaoul himself has reportedly declined to comment, Eric Hedvat — a broker with Jet Real Estate, which represented Magnum in the deal — characterized the transaction as “a seamless process.”</p>
      <p>Magnum reportedly went into contract with two other buyers in the same building using Bitcoin in 2018 — one for a 624-square-foot studio at an asking price of $875,000 and the other a 989-square-foot one-bedroom at $1.48 million.</p>
      <p>Another of Shaoul’s residential developments had been listed with an option to purchase using Bitcoin but was eventually sold for cash to Bronx-based investor Martin Shapiro last year for $82 million.</p>
      <p>Beyond Magnum, the Real Deal notes that Brooklyn-based rental management company announced in 2018 that it would be accepting cryptocurrency as payment.</p>
      <p>A current listing for a $29 million property on the Upper East Side, marketed by Corocan, notes the seller will “accept payment in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Ripple.”</p>
      <h3>Use Bitcoin to buy a 19th-century English church</h3>
      <p>Earlier this fall, Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-real-estate-firm-accepts-bitcoin-for-sale-of-150-year-old-church">reported</a> that a 150-year-old English church was listed for sale at $1.5 million, either in Bitcoin or fiat currency.</p>
      <p>Blockchain, the technology underpinning Bitcoin, is also increasingly being <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-registers-for-recording-ownership-rights-around-the-world">implemented</a> to cement ownership rights for real estate and business in order to mitigate fraud in land registries.</p>
