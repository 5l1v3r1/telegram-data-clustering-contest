      <h1>Boy who fell from Tate Modern gallery able to move legs, parents say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:28:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author">Rory Sullivan, CNN</a></address>
      <p>The six-year-old boy allegedly thrown from a viewing platform at the <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/10/02/europe/tate-accused-identified-gbr-scli-intl/index.html">Tate Modern </a>art museum in London can now move his legs and go outside in a wheelchair, according to a statement from his family.</p>
      <p>The boy, a French tourist, was hospitalized with serious injuries following <a href="https://cnn.com/2019/08/06/uk/tate-modern-boy-court-hearing-intl-gbr/index.html">the incident on August 4</a>, which took place on the 10th floor of the museum.</p>
      <p>In a statement shared on a<a href="https://uk.gofundme.com/f/medical-funds-for-tate-tragedy"> fundraising</a> page set up to support the boy, his family said he was making lots of progress: "We can now bring him outside in a wheelchair to breath fresh air. It's tiring for him but he really likes it, of course."</p>
      <p>They added that in the past few days he has started to move his legs a bit, and that -- as of Sunday -- he has managed to give "real kisses".</p>
      <p>This comes a month after the family shared the news -- on the same fundraising page -- that the boy had been moved from intensive care to a rehabilitation center. In this previous post, they called him their "little knight" because of the "full armor of splints" used to help his limbs heal.</p>
      <p>To date, the GoFundMe fundraising page has raised nearly €144,000 ($158,600) for the child's family.</p>
      <p>Jonty Bravery, 18, from west London, is accused of attempting to murder the unnamed boy by throwing him from the museum's balcony. He is due in court in December for a plea hearing, according to the PA Media news agency.</p>
