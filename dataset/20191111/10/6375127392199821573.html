      <h3>On a beautiful day in beautiful Macau, Filipina archer Andrea Robles was beautiful.</h3>
      <p>The 21-year-old Robles did the country proud in the world stage after winning the gold medal in the women’s compound competitions of the 2019 Indoor Archery World Series at the Venetian Resort Hotel in Macau on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The victory of the 21-year-old management graduate from Ateneo came less than a month after gymnast Carlos Yulo and female boxer Nesthy Petecio had given the country something to cheer by winning in their respective world tournaments they competed in.</p>
      <p>In achieving the feat, Robles, no stranger to triumphs in big tournaments abroad, beat American Paige Pearce-Gore in the hotly-contested finals, 141-135, to capture the gold medal.</p>
      <p>News of her victory first appeared at the Manila Times.</p>
      <p>The road to the finals was a bumpy one for the beauteous Robles. In the semifinals, the Filipina beat Belgian Sarah Prieels by the slimmest of margin, 146-145, to get a shot at the American finalist.</p>
      <p>“That was a super tight match. I was leading throughout by two points, and in the fourth end we got tied. So, in the last end was the very crucial part and I was very nervous,” Robles said.</p>
      <p>“Then I got the lead by one point to win,” she added.</p>
      <p>Actually, Robles joined this tough tournament as part of the Philippine  team buildup for the 30th Southeast Asian Games scheduled to kick off in colorful ceremonies on Nov. 30 at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
      <p>She was surprised to win this big one.</p>
      <p>“I was super excited to join this competition for the first time. I’m expecting just to have fun. I just did my very best and I’m thankful to be in the finals, then I won the gold,” Robles said.</p>
      <p>The win definitely made Robles a marked archer in the SEA Games, where she’ll lead the National compound team.</p>
      <p>To World Archery Philippines president Clint Aranas, Robles’ achievement didn’t come as a surprise.</p>
      <p>“Andrea has been a rising star since she joined us four years ago. Magaling talaga ‘yan,” Aranas said.</p>
