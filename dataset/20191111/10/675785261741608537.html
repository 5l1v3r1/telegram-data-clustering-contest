      <h2>Olivia Colman plays the Queen in season three of The Crown, but the show will cover some controversial subjects that could make uncomfortable viewing for members of the Royal Family</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:22:27+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:22</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Olivia Colman's portrayal of the Queen has caused a lot of excitement among royal fans and people can't wait to her see her take on the role.</p>
      <p>While early reviews rave about the Oscar winner's performance, the show will cover some controversial subjects that could make uncomfortable viewing for members of the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>So it's hardly surprising that Olivia's conversation with Prince William about filming for the show was a tad awkward, and she admits it "didn't go well".</p>
      <p>She met him at a fancy dinner party and the pair got chatting about her work.</p>
      <p>Asked if she had ever met any of the royals on the Graham Norton Show, she said: "Yes, but it didn’t go very well.</p>
      <p>"I met Prince William at a dinner and he asked what I was doing at the moment before he quickly added, 'Actually, I know what you’re doing'.</p>

      <p>"I was so excited and asked, ‘Have you watched it?’ His answer was a firm, ‘No.’</p>
      <p>"But he was very charming and very lovely.”</p>
      <p>During the show she also revealed she worked with a movement coach ahead of filming to try and perfect the Queen's walk.</p>
      <p>"It turns out I can't change what my body does. So I still walk like me, which I've been told is like a farmer."</p>
      <p>Season three of The Crown will cover a number of topics including Prince Charles's relationships.</p>

      <p>One of the storylines has outraged royal experts and biographers - the Queen Mother and Lord Mountbatten trying to break up Charles and Camilla Shand - and they claim it could "do a lot of damage".</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor told the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/04/crown-season-3-netflix-drama-depicts-fictional-plot-split-prince/">Telegraph</a> she's concerned about what the dramatised version of the events could do for the family's reputation.</p>
      <p>She insists that Camilla was very much in love with Andrew when she met Charles and they had already been close for several years.</p>
      <p>She also says the prince was always due to go to the Caribbean and she's never heard anything else suggested.</p>

      <p>She said: "He was a commanding officer, Charles was very much a work in progress at that point, there was no competition between the two men.</p>
      <p>"That’s what terrifies me about the whole series. It can do a lot of damage."</p>
      <p>Expert Christopher Wilson also finds the idea of the Queen Mother and Lord Mountbatten working together very hard to believe.</p>
      <p>He claims she was "never a great fan of his" and said she "always treated him with suspicion".</p>
      <p>He told the newspaper: "I don’t know why (creator) Peter Morgan has taken this line. The story is good enough without embellishing it."</p>
