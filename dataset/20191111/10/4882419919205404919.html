      <h1>Calciomercato: Juventus want Barça's Rakitic but put off by his salary</h1>
      <h2>There is also interest from Milan and Inter in the Barcelona midfielder</h2>

      <p>Juventus seem to want to push hard for the signing of Barcelona's Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic, who is still not playing regularly in Ernesto Valverde's side.</p>
      <p>A number of other Italian clubs are also interested in Rakitic, such as AC Milan and Inter, and he could leave Camp Nou in January if his situation does not change.</p>
      <p>Rakitic, who has a contract with Barça until 2021, has one thing working against him, though, when it comes to moving to Serie A: his salary.</p>
      <p>According to 'calciomercato.com', Juve remain keen on the Croatia international but at the moment they are separated by, among other things, the eight million euros he earns in Spain. The Old Lady are not ready to pay so much.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Rakitic's future could lie in Milan, where the two clubs are prepared to pay more money to lure him to Italy in the winter transfer window.</p>
