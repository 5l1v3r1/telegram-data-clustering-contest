      <p>NEW DELHI: India’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/power-demand">power demand</a> fell 13.2% in October from a year ago, posting its steepest monthly decline in over 12 years, government data showed, reflecting a deepening growth slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy.</p>
      <p>The South Asian country needs electricity to fuel its expanding economy but a third decline in power consumption in as many months points to tapering industrial activity in the nation that aims to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024.</p>
      <p>India’s June quarter GDP grew at its weakest pace in six years as consumer demand and government spending slowed, and economists see the falling <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/electricity-demand">electricity demand</a> as a reflection of a further slowdown.</p>
      <p>“The slowdown seems to be deep rooted, especially in the industrial sector. That would certainly increase the anxiety with regard to growth prospects in the current year,” said N R Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi.</p>
      <p>Consumption in heavily industrialised states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat led the decline. Last month, power demand in Maharashtra declined by 22.4% and in Gujarat by 18.8%, the data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) showed. Barring four small states in the country’s north and the east, demand fell across regions, the data showed.</p>
      <p>India’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/infrastructure-output">infrastructure output</a> in September contracted 5.2%, the worst in 14 years, adding to the worries of the government that has been unable to revive demand in the economy despite several steps in the last few months.</p>
      <p>Its fuel demand growth - also seen by economists as an indicator of economic activity - is on track for the slowest pace in six years.</p>
      <p>Economists said India’s growth could fall as low as 5.8%, dragged down by a slump in consumer demand and investment. India’s central bank last month cut its growth forecast by 80 basis points for the year ending March 2020 to 6.1%.</p>
      <p>Slower economic activity has resulted in a fall in sales of everything from cars to cookies, with some large scale industries resorting to large job cuts.</p>
      <p>India’s automobile sector, for instance, has cut hundreds of thousands of jobs, citing an unprecedented decline in sales.</p>
      <p>“Now we are talking about a sub 6% growth for the current fiscal year,” Bhanumurthy told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The Indian government, which has not revised its growth forecast of 7% for the financial year, is expected to release data on economic growth by the end of this month. Information on electricity demand prior to January 2006 is not publicly available.</p>
      <p>Populous states such as Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP) saw demand fall - with MP’s electricity requirement falling by over a fourth and UP seeing a decline of 8.3%.</p>
