      <p><b>BEIJINGÂ (AP)</b> - China's auto sales fell 5.8% from a year earlier in October as demand for electric cars plunged, an industry group reported Monday, extending a painful squeeze in the global industry's biggest market.</p>
      <p>The Chinese auto market is on track to contract for second year, dragged down by weak demand in the face of cooling economic growth and a tariff war with Washington.</p>
      <p>Drivers bought 1.9 million sedans, SUVs and minivans, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.</p>
      <p>Sales growth has been in negative territory every month since June 2018.</p>
      <p>Total vehicle sales, including trucks and buses, shrank 0.6% to 2.3 million.</p>
      <p>Sales of electric and gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles tumbled 45.6% to 75,000. Demand has been hurt by the end of government subsidies in mid-2019.</p>
      <p>Beijing has spent billions of dollars promoting electrics sales. Regulators are shifting the burden to automakers by eliminating subsidies and imposing minimum sales quotas. That raises the cost to buyers.</p>
      <p>The October figures were a small improvement over September's 6.3% contraction and better than double-digit contractions in previous months.</p>
      <p>Still, sales were off 11% in the first 10 months of 2019 compared with a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Electrics sales still are up 10.1% for the year to date, reflecting strong first-half demand before the end of subsidies.</p>
      <p>Sales of SUVs, usually a bright spot for the industry, were down 8.3% in the first 10 months of the year but CAAM gave no total. That was slight improvement over the 9.3% decline for the nine months through September.</p>
      <p>Sales by Chinese brands were down 9.6% from a year earlier at 770,000. They lost 1.7 percentage points of market share to 39.9%.</p>
