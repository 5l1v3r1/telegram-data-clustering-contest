      <h3>Knights set out as heavy underdogs vs mighty Lions.</h3>
      <p>LETRAN hopes to reprise its improbable 2015 feat when it faces mighty San Beda today in the NCAA men’s basketball championship at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>The Knights will enter the 4 p.m. series opener as heavy underdogs against the four-peat seeking Red Lions, who are coming off a long rest after completing an 18-game sweep of eliminations.</p>
      <p>Despite all the overwhelming odds, first-year Letran coach Bonnie Tan is looking forward to his troops to leave everything on the floor to raise championship banner No. 18.</p>
      <p>The Knights are making their first Finals appearance since Aldin Ayo steered his alma mater to the crown against their bitter rivals four years ago.</p>
      <p>“I honestly, before taking the job, I know that this team left by coach Jeff Napa is a very talented team. From the first day na nag-practice ako sa Letran, I keep on mentioning them na this is the best team na hinawakan ko, talent-wise,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>”Surprised in a way, we were ranked third in the eliminations but we still went all the way to play for the championship,” he added.</p>
      <p>No wonder, San Beda coach Boyet Fernandez is so worried despite having Letran’s number owing their foes deep bench.</p>
      <p>That’s why Tan emphasized the need for his Knights to have balanced scoring if they want to conquer the Lions.</p>
      <p>Graduating standouts Jerrick Balanza and Bonbon Batiller, as well as vastly-improved Fran Yu and big man Larry Muyang were solid for Letran, especially in the step-ladder wins against San Sebastian and Lyceum of the Philippines University where they displayed tremendous composure.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy na nagtiwala sila sa system,” said Tan.</p>
      <p>Gunning for a league-best 23rd title, the Lions cannot be complacent against a hungry Knights determined to reclaim lost glory.</p>
      <p>Even with the graduation of now pros Robert Bolick and Javee Mocon, San Beda, which has won 32 consecutive games dating back from last season, was still able to dominate behind soon-to-be crowned MVP Calvin Oftana, and the young backcourt duo of James Canlas and Evan Nelle.</p>
      <p>One huge advantage for the defensive-minded Lions is Cameroonian slotman Donald Tankoua, the 2017 Finals MVP who is seeking to end his collegiate stint as winner.</p>
      <p>A loss to Letran is definitely a huge disappointment for San Beda.</p>
      <p>The Lions have won their last eight meetings against the Knights since 2016.</p>
      <p>“Papahirapan namin silang makuha ng panalo. I expect na maganda ang ilalaro namin,” said Balanza, one of the remnants of the 2015 champion team under Ayo. </p>
