      <h1>Gary Neville's Premier League title verdict after Liverpool's win over Man City</h1>
      <h2>The 3-1 victory over Man City on Sunday put Jurgen Klopp's side nine points clear of the defending champions, in fourth, and eight ahead of Leicester and Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T10:08:40+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Gary Neville believes it is only a matter of time until <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> lift the Premier League title - and he reckons this season could be their year.</p>
      <p>The 3-1 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> on Sunday put Jurgen Klopp's side nine points clear of the defending champions, in fourth, and eight ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> .</p>
      <p>They have taken 34 points from a possible 36 since the start of the season and the only other two clubs to have been in a similar position - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in 1993 and City in 2017 - both went on to win the title.</p>
      <p>And Neville, the Manchester United legend, believes this form is why the Anfield giants are rightly being lauded as the favourites for the crown.</p>

      <p>Speaking on his <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11669/11859094/listen-gary-neville-podcast">Gary Neville podcast</a> , he said: "To win the Champions League you have to be some team, to get to back-to-back Champions League finals you have to be some team.</p>
      <p>"To do what they did last year and chase Man City down relentlessly to the end - they are playing championship football, Premier League title-winning football.</p>
      <p>"They have been now for 18 months.</p>
      <p>"They could blow this, yes, City could come back, yes there could be a freak from Chelsea or Leicester, but it’s becoming more unlikely."</p>
      <p>Neville says an injury crisis could cause a huge headache for Klopp, like it has done for City manager Pep Guardiola - but feels the Reds have what it takes to lift the trophy.</p>

      <p>"The biggest risk to Liverpool is getting caught up with the Champions League, with injuries to [Mo] Salah, [Sadio] Mane, [Virgil] Van Dijk - that would be a big problem for them, losing one of those players for a couple of months at a time, just like it has been for City losing [Aymeric] Laporte.</p>
      <p>"But all things point towards Liverpool being big, big favourites for the title.</p>
      <p>"And it’s not just because they’re nine points clear (of City).</p>
      <p>"It’s the steps that they’ve been taking in the seasons before to get closer and closer and closer and closer.</p>
      <p>"And eventually they will get there and it’s looking like, at this moment in time, they’re going to take some real stopping."</p>
