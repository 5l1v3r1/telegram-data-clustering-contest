      <p>BAGHDAD -- The United Nations top envoy to Iraq, seeking support for a roadmap to resolve massive anti-government protests, said Monday that the country's most powerful Shiite religious leader backs serious reforms but is concerned politicians will not carry them out.</p>
      <p>Overnight, four protesters were killed and some 130 wounded in renewed clashes between security forces and protesters in the southern city of Nasiriyah, a rights group said.</p>
      <p>Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, the UN Special Representative to Iraq, met with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in the Shiite holy city of Najaf to discuss the series of reforms put forward by the UN a day earlier.</p>
      <p>"The marjaiyah made it clear that it supports the conduct of serious reforms in a reasonable period of time," she said, using the Arabic name for al-Sistani's authority. "Within that context, it welcomes the proposals of the United Nations, including the proposal for one consolidated electoral framework."</p>
      <p>"The marjaiyah also expresses its concerns that the political forces are not serious enough to carry out these reforms," she added.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq laid out a series of short- and long-term measures aimed at tackling protester demands, including electoral reform and anti-corruption initiatives.</p>
      <p>More immediate measures included the release of peaceful demonstrators detained since early October, an investigation into cases of abduction and punishing those found guilty of using excessive force against protesters.</p>
      <p>Hennis-Plasschaert said the UN would monitor the government's progress to ensure measures were being "done promptly, swiftly and decisively because this country needs to move forward."</p>
      <p>The casualties in Nasiriyah occurred during confrontations outside the education directorate as security forces tear-gassed protesters trying to block employees from reaching the building in the city centre.</p>
      <p>The semi-official Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights, which reported the toll, called the violence "regrettable" and added that some of the wounded are in serious conditions.</p>
      <p>At least 320 protesters have been killed by security forces since the protests and unrest over living conditions began last month.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators complain of widespread corruption, lack of job opportunities and poor basic services, including regular power cuts, despite Iraq's vast oil reserves.</p>
