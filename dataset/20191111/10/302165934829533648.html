      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 11 — The ringgit continued last week’s downtrend to close lower against the US dollar today, dampened by weak market sentiment amid declining crude oil prices, a dealer said.</p>
      <p>At 6pm, the ringgit was quoted at 4.1421/1450 versus the greenback from Friday’s close of 4.1310/1360.</p>
      <p>The dealer said the market sentiment was a bit poor due to the uncertainties in the United States (US)-China trade talks after President Donald Trump did not commit to rolling back the tariffs and the release of China’s weaker inflation data.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Trump denied that he had agreed to roll back tariffs as sought by China, contradicting previous reports of officials from both countries confirming the “phase one” trade deal.</p>
      <p>As of 6.30pm, benchmark Brent crude fell 1.10 per cent to US$61.82 per barrel on renewed caution over the prospect of a trade deal between the two economic giants.</p>
      <p>The local note also traded lower against other major currencies.</p>
      <p>The ringgit fell against the Singapore dollar to 3.0425/0451 from 3.0377/0418 last Friday and went down against the yen to 3.8008/8045 from 3.7774/7830.</p>
      <p>It slipped against the British pound to 5.3023/3077 from 5.2906/2986 and decreased versus the euro to 4.5679/5728 from 4.5594/5666. — Bernama</p>
