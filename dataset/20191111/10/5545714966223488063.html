      <h1>Death Stranding debuts at number two in the UK Charts</h1>
      <h2>But not enough to unseat Modern Warfare</h2>

      <p>It seems Hideo Kojima's epic deliver 'em up<i> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-death-stranding-568760.phtml">Death Stranding</a></i> has had a successful initial launch but, in terms of physical sales in the UK, it didn't shift quite enough boxed copies to make to the top of the UK Charts. <i>Death Stranding</i> is the second highest-selling new IP release of the year, behind Sony Bend's open-world adventure <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-days-gone-549944.phtml"><i>Days Gone.</i></a><br/><br/>The strange sci-fi title was kept from the number one spot by annual long-termer<i> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-570785.phtml">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a></i>, with the latter celebrating its third week in the premier position. Electronic Arts' racer<i> Need for Speed: Heat</i>, Epic Games' <i>Fortnite: Darkfire Bundle</i> and Nintendo's<i> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-mario-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-tokyo-2020-568634.phtml">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Tokyo Olympic Games 2020</a></i> also debuted in the Top Ten, taking positions five, seven and eight respectively.<br/><br/>Speaking of Nintendo, spooky Switch release<i> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-luigi-s-mansion-3-570488.phtml">Luigi's Mansion 3</a></i> slipped a couple of places to number four, but is still enjoying a very successful launch period as the biggest Nintendo release of 2019 so far. Elsewhere in the charts,<i> Jumanji: The Video Game</i> showed up at number 15 and, believe it or not, a brand new Wii game also hit the Top 20, with <i>Just Dance 2020</i> doing the Electric Slide into number 14.<br/><br/>It's going to take something major to usurp <i>Modern Warfare</i> between now and the Holiday season. Only upcoming Switch releases<i> Pokemon Sword and Shield</i> have the possibility of doing so. But given that those games' sales are counted as two separate titles, Activision's military shooter might be sitting pretty for the foreseeable future.</p>
