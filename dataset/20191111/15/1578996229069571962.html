      <h1>Netflix's Devil Next Door Follows the Decades-Long Hunt for Holocaust Killer Ivan the Terrible</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:56:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Kate Storey</a></address>
      <p>In the 1980s, John Demjanjuk was a retired auto worker living a quiet life with his family in a Cleveland suburb. But in 1985, a group of Holocaust survivors identified Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible, a sadistic Nazi death camp guard who tortured men, women, children, and babies before pushing them into the gas chamber at the Nazi German Treblinka camp in occupied Poland.</p>
      <p>The five episodes of the new Netflix series <i>The Devil Next Door, </i>from the executive producers of the docu-series<i> Wild, Wild Country, </i>follow the trials set over two decades which sought to determine whether Demjanjuk was a brutal killer, or the victim of mistaken identity. While interviews with Demjanjuk’s family portray him as an innocent family man unfairly maligned, the evidence against him is haunting.</p>
      <h3>Testimony by Holocaust Survivors</h3>

      <p>The documentary shows a small but clear headshot of Demjanjuk which set in motion the investigation against him in 1985. His name had been on a list of war criminals after he emigrated to the U.S., and a group of Holocaust survivors identified Demjanjuk’s image from a lineup after the image was sent over from the KGB in the 1980s. The survivors said they’d seen the man in the photo at the death camp Treblinka, and that they believed he was the notorious Ivan the Terrible, a guard who reveled in brutalizing and then murdering hundreds of thousands of Jews.</p>
      <p>When Holocaust survivors took the stand at Demjanjuk’s trial in Israel, they delivered vivid and horrifying accounts of their time at the death camps. They were certain they’d seen Demjanjuk push their relatives into the gas chamber, they said. One man left the stand, walking up to Demjanjuk to stare him in the eye, then shouted “That is the devil!” Another survivor pleaded, “Why did you kill them? Why?” as Demjanjuk sat expressionless in the courtroom.</p>
      <h3>The ID Card</h3>

      <p>Another key piece of evidence was an 1948 S.S. Identity Card with Demjanjuk’s name, photo, and accurate personal details. The photo is, of course, of a much younger man because it was taken more than 4 decades earlier, but it nears a striking resemblance to Demjanjuk.</p>
      <p>Demjanjuk claimed he’d never seen the picture and couldn’t be sure whether or not it was him, and his lawyer called it a “phony” card sent to the U.S. from the KGB, meant to spread misinformation and drive a wedge between Ukrainians and Jews in the States.</p>
      <p>The same trove of documents included evidence of Nazis sending the man identified as Demjanjuk to work as a guard at Sobibor, a camp near Treblinka, where Ivan the Terrible worked. Though no documents placed him at Treblinka, Sobibor was located near the camp in question and it was argued Demjanjuk could have been transferred over.</p>
      <h3>A Fax from KGB</h3>
      <p>Thanks to the ID card, other documents, and testimony from the Holocaust survivors, Demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1988. He was held until 1993 when the KGB faxed over additional paperwork indicating that another man named Ivan Marchenko was Ivan the Terrible. The Israeli Supreme Court struck down the earlier guilty conviction on grounds of reasonable doubt, pointing to the new evidence. The verdict resulted in outrage, particularly among the Holocaust survivors.</p>
      <p>“How could you be in Jerusualem sitting in a court of law and say that the survivors' testimony is less than a reasonable doubt?" Israeli State Prosecutor Eli Gabay says in the documentary. "To say to that survivor, 'The man you saw outside of the gas chamber for months on end killing your family? We don’t believe you. We just don’t believe you that it’s him.'”</p>
      <p>Demjanjuk was released by Israel and he returned to Cleveland, where he avoided attention until 1999.</p>
      <h3>A New Trial</h3>

      <p>The Israeli Supreme Court had ruled that Demjanjuk was not Treblinka camp’s Ivan the Terrible. But in 1999, the U.S. government sued Demjanjuk again to strip him of his citizenship to investigate his role as a Nazi guard at the Majdanek and Sobibor Nazi German camps in occupied Poland. The ID card had placed Demjanjuk at Sobibor, and the new trial investigated his role as an accessory to murder for the more than 27,000 killed there. In 2009, Demjanjuk was deported to Germany where he stood trial on the charges. The indictment, as quoted by the <i>New York Times</i>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/18/world/europe/john-demjanjuk-nazi-guard-dies-at-91.html">read</a>, “When a transport of Jews arrived, routine work was suspended and all camp personnel took part in the routine process of extermination.”</p>
      <p>During the new trial, the judge found clear evidence showing Demjanjuk’s path from Soviet prisoner to a guard at Sobibor. Defense attorneys for Demjanjuk tried to argue that their client had no choice but to work in the camp. In 2011, Demjanjuk was found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison, but he died in 2012 at age 91 while awaiting his appeal in a German nursing home. According to German law, a conviction isn't official until appeals are complete, leaving Demjanjuk's case unsettled.</p>
