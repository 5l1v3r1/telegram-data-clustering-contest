      <p>What is Wattam? Good question. Looking at the screenshots it's hard to tell, but San Francisco-based developer Funomena describes it as "a game about the joys of friendship and discovery", which sounds delightful.</p>
      <p>This is the latest thing to emerge from the colourful imagination of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/japan-week-love-and-poop-in-keita-takahashis-wattam/">Keita Takahashi</a>, a Japanese game designer who is perhaps best known for his work on the glorious Katamari Damacy series.</p>
      <p>Oh no, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAA6hq9RL-4">theme</a> is stuck in my head again.</p>
      <p>Wattam is designed to be played both solo and in co-op, letting players instantly pop in and out of multiplayer mode. As you play you'll apparently make friends with sushi, giant trees, and, er, toilets.</p>
      <p>I'm most enamoured by the description of the game as "the ultimate goof-around simulator." Players will be encouraged to test the limits of the game's physics to solve puzzles and create funny moments.</p>
      <p>I can't wait to play this, whatever it is. Wattam will be released on the Epic Games Store on December 17 and if you <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/wattam/home">pre-order</a> it now you can get some money off, which is nice.</p>
