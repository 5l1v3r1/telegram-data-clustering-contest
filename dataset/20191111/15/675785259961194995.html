      <p>Professional boxer Fury, another self-proclaimed influencer after starring on ITV hit show Love Island this year, has revealed that he stayed up until the early hours to watch the bout.</p>

      <p>And the British light-heavyweight, whose older brother is lineal world heavyweight champion Tyson, has challenged KSI to a showdown.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.secondsout.com/">Seconds Out</a> : "I was sat in the hotel room, it was about 10 o'clock and I thought, 'do you know what, Logan Paul and KSI are fighting tonight. Ok, a lot of people are jumping on it. I'll have a watch.'</p>
      <p>"So I went on the Sky Sports app, I bought it and I sat down and watched it all the way through.</p>
      <p>"I thought it was a very entertaining fight, a very entertaining fight, and I wasn't aware that KSI still wanted to fight afterwards. I thought he was just gonna fight Logan afterwards and that was it.</p>
      <p>"But I've heard that he does want to keep fighting.</p>

      <p>"You know, I'm a fighting man, I'm no amateur. We're both from the influencer background, he's from the YouTube side, I'm from the Love Island/reality TV side. Let's get it on.</p>
      <p>"If he wants a real fight, he knows where I am."</p>
      <p>Fury had two professional contests before entering the reality dating show earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He will fight for the first time since appearing on Love Island at London's Copper Box Arena on 21 December, with a fight pencilled in on the undercard of Daniel Dubois v Kyotaro Fujimoto.</p>
      <p>And, despite have a professional boxing background, the Manchester bruiser believes it would be an even contest against KSI.</p>

      <p>"Do you know what it is, right, I'm sure a lot of people will jump on this saying 'Tommy will do this, Tommy will do that' and obviously I back myself 100 per cent in any fight I go into," he added.</p>
      <p>"But if you actually look at the statistics, what is it? I've had 12 amateur fights when I was 15 years old and I've had three pro fights. There's not a lot in it.</p>
      <p>"Yeah I've been in the gym sparring around, but actually fighting wise, I've not had a lot of experience fighting and he's not had a lot of experience.</p>
      <p>"I'm 20, he's a young man, I've had three fights, he's had two fights.</p>
      <p>"If he wants to keep boxing, why not? Why not make it a battle of Britain."</p>
