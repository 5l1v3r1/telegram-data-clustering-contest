      <h1>British Steel: China's Jingye Group promises to save 'thousands' of jobs in £50m deal</h1>

      <p>The future of troubled industrial firm British Steel has taken a step closer to being secured through a £50m rescue deal by Chinese conglomerate Jingye, in a move it is hoped will save about 4,000 jobs.</p>
      <p>The Insolvency Service confirmed the deal this afternoon, which involves Jingye buying British Steel’s Scunthorpe plant, as well as its operations in Teesside and France.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Jingye said this afternoon it would invest £1.2bn in the company in a bid to improve its environmental credentials.</p>
      <p>It added that it would make offers to “as many employees across the business as possible”.</p>
      <p>Chairman Li Ganpo, who has spent the last week in Scunthorpe, is keen to keep the flagship plant alive.</p>
      <p>British Steel went into administration in May after months of financial struggles, prompting the government to take temporary control while it looked for a buyer.</p>
      <p>The government’s official receiver signed the deal in principle today, although that is yet to be formally closed out.</p>
      <p>Jingye Group chairman Li Ganpo, said: “This is the beginning of a long journey. We know that this is only the start of the hard work of revitalizing British Steel.</p>
      <p>“But we believe that this combination will create a powerful, profitable and sustainable business that will ensure the long-term future of thousands of jobs while producing the innovative high-quality steel products that the world needs.”</p>
      <p>The Chinese conglomerate produces about 15m tonnes of steel a year, and employs 23,500 people. It also has interests in the hotel and retail industries.</p>
      <p>Closing the deal now depends on gaining regulatory approval in the UK, a process which could stretch into the new year.</p>
      <p>Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of steelworkers’ trade union Community, said: “Whatever government is in place in the coming weeks it is vital that all steps are taken to successfully conclude this process – everyone needs to remain focused on achieving that outcome to save our steel. “</p>
      <p>Jingye re-entered the fray after talks with Turkish company Ataer broke down because of what one source called “difficulties” with the Turkish government.</p>
      <p>Ataer is the investment arm of Turkey’s military pension fund, and has strong links to President Recyep Ergodan’s regime.</p>

      <p>The Chinese conglomerate had also encountered problems with its government when it initially made a move for British Steel this summer, before rescinding its interest.</p>
      <p><i>City A.M.</i> understands those hurdles have now been cleared.</p>
