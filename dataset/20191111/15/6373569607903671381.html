      <p>Plymouth Argyle wing-back Joe Riley has been playing through the pain barrier to try and avoid an operation, manager Ryan Lowe has revealed.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old is still struggling with the after effects of the broken left arm he suffered in an away game against Blackpool at the end of March.</p>
      <p>Riley has made 14 starts and two substitute appearances <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">for the Pilgrims</a> this season, and scored two goals.</p>
      <p>However, he was ruled out of the 1-0 FA Cup first round win away to Bolton Wanderers, the club where he began his career, after falling on the arm in training on Friday.</p>
      <p>Riley needed injections to play in home games against Salford City and Walsall earlier in the season because of the pain he was in.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “He has had a few whacks on it. He has had a bandage on it a few times, and a strapping and what not.</p>
      <p>“In all honesty, I think it’s broke still but he doesn’t want to get the operation because it could rule him out for six to eight weeks.</p>
      <p>“Then by the six to eight weeks he could find himself out of the team, and that’s what he doesn’t want to do.</p>
      <p>“To be fair to him, he’s trying to go through the pain barrier with it but that’s why we have a squad.”</p>
      <p>In the absence of Riley against Bolton, Joe Edwards to right wing-back and Josh Grant impressively played the midfield holding role.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “Joe was gutted not to play because it (Bolton) is where he came through but you have to take the decision out of his hands.</p>
      <p>“We sit down – the physio (Paul Atkinson) and John (Lucas, Argyle’s fitness and conditioning coach) – and say ‘Look, it’s not going to work’.</p>
      <p>“Joe Edwards has gone in there and was fantastic, and Josh has gone in the holding midfield role and was fantastic.”</p>
