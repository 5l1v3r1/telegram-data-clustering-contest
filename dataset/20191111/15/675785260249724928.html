      <h2>Rick and Morty season 4 episode 1 was dedicated to four-time Emmy winning producer Mike Mendel</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:04:02+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:04</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>The opening episode of Rick and Morty season 4 included a touching dedication.</p>
      <p>The premiere of the Adult Swim series was in loving memory of producer Mike Mendel, who <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/breaking-j-michael-mendel-dead-20163889">passed away at the age of 54 on September 22.</a></p>
      <p>Mike Mendel was a four-time Emmy Award winner, having also been a producer on 207 episodes of iconic animated comedy <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-simpsons">The Simpsons.</a></p>
      <p>The late producer had worked on Rick and Morty since it began on Adult Swim in 2013, whilst also having successful cinema credits as an associate producer on the likes of Big, Broadcast News, and Jerry Maguire.</p>
      <p>Upon Mendel's passing in September, the US network said: “All of us are devastated by the untimely passing of producer Mike Mendel.</p>
      <p>'He guided and supported a generation of artists, writers and creators and his absence will be felt by the entire community.</p>
      <p>"Our deepest condolences go out to his family, friends and colleagues."</p>

      <p>Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinRoiland/status/1176231061115887616?s=20">tweeted</a> : "My friend, partner, and line producer Mike Mendel passed away. I am devastated. My heart breaks for his family. I don’t know what I’m going to do without you by my side Mike. I’m destroyed."</p>
      <p>The series has just returned with its fourth season premiere in the US on Adult Swim.</p>
      <p>The popular animated sci-fi comedy is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/rick-morty-season-4-released-20858956">due to return for five episode in the UK next year</a> , but will no longer be shown on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> .</p>
      <p>Not to worry, however, as the series has an accessible new home.</p>
