      <h1>Bakkt Rolls Out ‘Critical’ Bitcoin Custody After NY Gives Green Light</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:29:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Institutional Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) trading platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bakkt">Bakkt</a> has announced it has launched its custody feature for its entire client base following regulatory approval.</p>
      <h3>Bakkt: custody is “critical link” in BTC adoption</h3>
      <p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/bakkt-blog/raising-the-bar-announcing-bakkt-institutional-custody-ed5e2ad0da9a">blog post</a> on Nov. 11, Bakkt said it had received the go-ahead from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to offer custody services to any institution. Previously, the option was only available for those trading its <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitcoin-futures">Bitcoin futures</a>.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the release, Bakkt described the custody tool as “the critical link in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin.”</p>
      <p>“Safely storing digital assets demands a comprehensive approach to custody. Institutions and sophisticated investors need more than cutting-edge technology. They require proven infrastructure, robust operational controls, and independent oversight,” the blog post added.</p>
      <h3>Investors eye price reaction</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph reported, the wider cryptocurrency sphere has keenly eyed the appearance of custody solutions following initial futures rollouts beginning in 2017.</p>
      <p>Among them is <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/michael-novogratz">Mike Novogratz</a>, the serial investor who recently identified Bakkt’s offering as forming part of the essential metamorphosis of Bitcoin’s institutional appeal. </p>
      <p>“But more importantly they’ve got a custody solution that’s just coming online… world-class custody which allows more and more people to feel comfortable with it,” he said in an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-novogratzs-galaxy-firm-is-launching-new-bitcoin-funds">interview</a> late last month. </p>
      <p>Bakkt’s Bitcoin futures contracts have set new records of their own in recent days, with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-trading-volume-just-hit-another-all-time-high">$15 million</a> traded daily.</p>
