      <p>With Jon Jones’ next title defense expected to be against Dominick Reyes, the reigning UFC light heavyweight champion and pound-for-pound No. 1 has slammed the undefeated challenger for showing him fake respect.</p>
      <p>Reyes made a sarcastic comment about Jones finally stepping up to the plate to face a ‘new generation’ fighter, and ‘Bones’ responded with the following derogatory tweet.</p>

      <p>“You started this whole thing talking about party favors and now you’re going to show this fake ass respect? Serious question Dominic, what exactly is so next generation about you or your fighting style? Youre a new name, that’s the only thing different about you,” Jones posted on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The JacksonWink product followed up with another tweet criticizing Reyes’ fighting style, claiming the 29-year-old will be easy to figure out after the first round.</p>

      <p>“That’s the easy way out, I don’t do easy. There’s absolutely no where in his game I’m intimidated. He’s dangerous in the first round, after that I’ll figure him out and pick them apart,” Jones commented.</p>
      <p>Reyes earned his title shot after he disposed of former middleweight champion Chris Weidman via first-round KO at UFC on ESPN 6, extending his professional mixed martial arts record to a perfect 12-0.</p>
      <p>Jones, 32, last fought earlier this year at UFC 239, where he edged a split decision win over Thiago Santos in arguably his least impressive title defense to date. Despite a turbulent career and multiple failed drug tests, Jones is still widely considered the greatest fighter of all time.</p>
