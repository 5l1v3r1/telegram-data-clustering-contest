      <h2>Hunters Hill College has been placed in special measures following a damning Ofsted inspection while boarding provision could be axed permanently after serious safeguarding allegations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:55:34+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Jackson, https://www.facebook.com/CarlJacksonBCC/</a></address>
      <p>A special school for boys has been heavily criticised for 'widespread' failures and stating that naughty children will be 'hung drawn and quartered'.</p>
      <p>Hunters Hill College, based at Spirehouse Lane in Blackwell, Bromsgrove, but maintained by Birmingham City Council, has been placed in special measures by watchdog Ofsted after earning the bottom rating of 'inadequate'.</p>
      <p>The council has also suspended its boarding provision and is due to consult with parents about scrapping it permanently following a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/residential-unit-special-school-shut-16901049">number of serious safeguarding allegations</a> - not of a criminal nature - currently being investigated.</p>

      <p>The government has now issued an Academy Order. Ofsted inspectors visited on September 18 and 19 following a number of complaints. They provided a general report and another for its residential school which caters for up to 32 pupils.</p>
      <p>Inspectors ruled that the boarding provision was in breach of 20 national minimum standards ranging from record-keeping to the condition of the accommodation.</p>
      <p>Elaborating on their findings inspectors stated progress to improve internal decoration had been 'far too slow' while pupil/staff relationships had 'at times been severely compromised' due to a failure to follow the proper procedure when children made complaints.</p>
      <p>They also criticised incorrect and missing records, 'out-of-date' information and policies containing 'inappropriate language'.</p>

      <p>"For example, the behaviour management policy includes language that indicates that children will be subject to being 'hung drawn and quartered'," said the report.</p>
      <p>The watchdog also highlighted an incident where a boy had cut his hand on broken glass but staff failed to record what medical treatment and advice was given at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Another concern included a staff family member living on the grounds who had not been subject to a Disclosure and Barring Service (CBS) check.</p>
      <p>"There are serious and widespread failures, which mean that children and young people are not protected, or their welfare is not promoted or safeguarded," the residential report concluded. The general report for the college, which has around 115 pupils on the roll, was equally critical.</p>

      <p>It rated the key areas around education, behaviour and leadership as 'inadequate' while personal development was rated 'requires improvement'. Ofsted went on to highlight 'poor' behaviour and education standards, prevalent bullying, high levels of disruption in lessons, declining pupil attendance, low staff morale and high absence levels.</p>
      <p>Their report said: "This school is failing its pupils. The quality of education is poor. Pupils leave at the end of Year 11 with weak skills in reading, writing and mathematics. Because of this, nearly all pupils who go on to college study courses at levels below what they should be studying.</p>
      <p>"The school’s expectations of what pupils can achieve are too low. Some teachers try to raise standards in their subject. But too many staff accept low standards of work and poor behaviour. This poor behaviour is stopping pupils from learning."</p>
      <p>And regarding the safeguarding allegations the report added: "The alleged concerns are currently being investigated. The head of care is currently away from the school and two members of staff have left. These sudden changes have created uncertainty for the children, their families and the remaining members of staff."</p>
      <p>There were some positives including the activities provided at lunchtime and the efforts of subject leaders but ultimately the school was handed a whole raft of improvements to make. The council has placed two leaders in the school, one who has been present since May and the other since September.</p>

      <p>A council spokeswoman said: "The Ofsted report highlights significant issues at Hunters Hill. We will continue to work closely with the leadership team to support them in driving through sustainable improvements so that all children get the education they need and deserve."</p>
      <p>The residential school rated by Ofsted accommodates boys aged between 11 to 16. Many of the pupils have been diagnosed with social emotional mental health, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, an autism spectrum disorder and Asperger syndrome. Boarding was available until the end of the summer term but was suspended for the new academic year by the council following complaints over the break.</p>

      <p>A school letter to parents in September said: "We are aware that some serious allegations are being made and these are currently being investigated. Having taken advice from Birmingham City Council (BCC), during this time, the school will not be operating residential provision to support this process. We want to assure you that our priority is the safety and wellbeing of your children and as part of gaining this assurance we have engaged external personnel to undertake a review of our safeguarding practices.</p>
      <p>"Our mission is to continually improve the experience for young people at Hunters Hill and to this end we will continue, in collaboration with BCC and other external agencies, to systematically explore the validity of any allegations of inappropriate practice and do what is necessary to ensure the very best outcomes for all pupils."</p>
