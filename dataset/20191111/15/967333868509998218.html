      <p>Live feed of the planet Mercury making a rare transit across the surface of the sun on Monday, November 11, from various positions across the globe including the Teide and Roque de los Muchachos Observatories in Spain. </p>
      <p>Mercury will cross in front of the sun on 11 November, but don't expect any barnyard animals to worry about the sky falling: the planet is 190 times smaller than the visible size of the Sun. The passage will last for seven hours. But try not to look at it.</p>
      <p>According to the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), however, looking at the celestial event with a telescope is an incredibly foolish thing to do and could result in blindness. </p>
      <p>NASA adds that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201903161073285929-On-Average-Earth-Closer-Mercury-than-Venus/">Mercury transits occur only</a> 13 times every century; the next passage of Mercury across the Sun will happen in 2032.</p>
      <p>The only places on the planet where this astronomical phenomenon can't be 'seen' are Australia and most parts of Asia and Alaska.</p>
