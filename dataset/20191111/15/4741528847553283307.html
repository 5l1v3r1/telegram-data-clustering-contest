      <h1>YouTube’s new policy creates uncertainty among content creators</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:25:51+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/chidinma-nwagbara/" target="_blank">Chidinma Nwagbara</a></address>
      <p>Online streaming service, YouTube seems to have instilled fear in content creators with its newly updated Terms of Service scheduled to take effect from December 10, 2019.</p>
      <p><b>Although the new terms </b>do not change the way YouTube treats or uses content uploaded by users, it has clarified some policies that were making users get worried that their accounts could be deleted.</p>
      <p><b>According to</b> <b>the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms?preview=20191210&amp;chromeless=1">section</a></b> titled ‘Account Suspension &amp; Termination’ with the subheading ‘Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes’, <i>“YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube reasonably believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.”</i></p>
      <p><b>What this means: </b>This means accounts of YouTubers, who aren’t making enough money nor generating enough views, may be deleted. This is one of the updates that are not in YouTube’s current policy.</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>The new <a href="https://mashable.com/article/youtube-new-terms-of-service-no-longer-commercially-viable/">policy</a> gives YouTube</b> the power to delete a creator’s account if they upload or livestream video that doesn’t pull in enough advertising revenue. It is pertinent to note that apart from content creators, YouTube could also remove accounts of viewers as the terms do not explicitly state content creators alone.</p>
      <p><b>Reactions: </b>Since the pop-up window of notification for the new policy started showing when users log on to the app, YouTube has been criticized as YouTubers have been lamenting on Twitter.</p>
      <p><b>Nevertheless</b>, some think the policy applies to users who make videos without following the rules and regulations of YouTube and so hurt the brand, instead of users who do not make enough money for the company.</p>

      <p><b>The company was said to have sent a mail</b> to inform content creators first before throwing it out to the general public. This move by YouTube could either make or mar the company as it now seems it is focusing more on its biggest, most profitable creators while giving smaller creators fewer chances of monetizing their work.</p>
