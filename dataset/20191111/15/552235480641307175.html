      <h2>Volunteers are sacrificing their big day to host a party in Creetown Youth Club Hall</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:41:30+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Gillespie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-gillespie/</a></address>
      <p>Big-hearted Creetown residents have pledged that no-one living locally will spend Christmas on their own.</p>
      <p>And to make that happen volunteers are sacrificing their big day to host a party in the village.</p>
      <p>An unofficial committee has been formed to run the event – which will be free to everyone attending.</p>
      <p>Founders Eddie McGaw, Val Nichol, Evelene McClymont and Donna Alexander have already been inundated with cash and gifts.</p>
      <p>Evelene said: “This is for everybody that’s on our own – no matter what their age.</p>
      <p>“We want to help because you don’t want anybody to be lonely.</p>
      <p>“We dont yet know what kind of numbers we will get but even if we get five or 10 people at least we will have made a difference for some folk.”</p>
      <p>Evelene, 61 and friend Val, 59, will be cooking turkey and all the trimmings at home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The festive fare will then be taken piping hot up to Creetown Youth Club Hall.</p>
      <p>And from noon to 3pm drinks, a sing-a-long, bingo and music will also be laid on.</p>
      <p>Evelene reckons putting off family celebrations is a small price to pay.</p>
      <p>“We can have dinner at night when we get home,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This is something for folk to look forward to instead of sitting on their own at Christmas.</p>
      <p>“Transport will be laid on for folk if anyone needs it – they don’t have to worry about going.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The party committee has already met twice and will gather again on December 5 – the deadline for names to be submitted.</p>
      <p>Several other volunteers have come on board since the group was formed.</p>
      <p>Val, 59, said: “We are asking local businesses for help. Some and have already given us raffle prizes and donations.</p>
      <p>“People have just been handing us money in the street. Everybody has been absolutely wonderful.”</p>
      <p>She added: “If this benefits other folk that’s what matter most. We know we all have families to come home to.”</p>
      <p>Anyone from Creetown or Carsluith who would like to attend the party – or knows someone who would – can contact Eddie on 07967 267850, Val on 07552 560429 or Evelene 07975 798801 by December 5.</p>
