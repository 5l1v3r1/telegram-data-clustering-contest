      <p>Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian man during confrontations with stone-throwing protesters in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/occupied-west-bank.html">occupied West Bank</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old man was shot in the chest in al-Arroub refugee camp, near Hebron city, Palestinian health officials said.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if he had taken part in protests marking the 15th anniversary of the death of former Palestinian leader <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/yasser-arafat.html">Yasser Arafat</a>.</p>
      <p>An Israeli military spokeswoman said troops were sent into Al-Arroub in pursuit of local Palestinians who had thrown rocks at cars on a nearby road, and opened fire when confronted by "a large number of rioters", some wielding petrol bombs.</p>
      <p>The fatal shooting was under investigation, she added.</p>
      <p>The West Bank, among territories where Palestinians seek statehood, has seen simmering violence since US-brokered peace talks with<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/israel.html"> Israel</a> stalled in 2014.</p>
      <p>Medics also reported Israeli use of live fire in clashes at Fawwar, south of Hebron, on Monday.</p>
      <p>Hamas, the leaders of the Gaza Strip, prohibited a Fatah event to mark <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/investigations/killing-arafat/killing-arafat-full-story-2013116125955541864.html">the death of Arafat</a> in the coastal Palestinian enclave.</p>
      <p>Hamas and Fatah, which Arafat led, have been deeply divided since the 2007 near civil war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
      <h3>Arafat's death</h3>
      <p>Arafat died on November 11, 2004, at a French military hospital after suffering a sudden illness following three years of Israeli military siege around his Ramallah headquarters.</p>
      <p>The official cause of death was a large haemorrhagic stroke, but no autopsy was carried out and senior Palestinian leaders withheld his medical records.</p>
      <p>Swiss scientists who conducted tests on samples taken from Arafat's body found at least 18 times the normal levels of radioactive polonium in his remains.</p>
