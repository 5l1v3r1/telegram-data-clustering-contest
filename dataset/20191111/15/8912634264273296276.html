      <p>GUWAHATI: An elephant named after the late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that killed five Indian villagers has been caught after a massive operation to hunt down the creature, officials said Monday.<br/>Wildlife rangers tracked the pachyderm — dubbed “Laden” by the locals it menaced in northeastern Assam state — through a forest for several days using drones and domesticated elephants.<br/>“We started the final leg of the operation today... Two darts were fired by experts which had tranquilized the male elephant,” a senior forestry official told AFP.<br/>“Now the work is on to shift the elephant to a forest where there is no human habitation nearby.”<br/>The animal killed five people, including three women, during a 24-hour rampage through Goalpara district in October.<br/>Officials said they would take the elephant’s welfare into account as well as the safety of people living nearby in deciding where it would be relocated<br/>Nearly 2,300 people have been killed by elephants in India over the last five years, according to official figures released in June, while 700 elephants have been killed since 2011 — figures resulting in part from shrinking natural habitats.<br/>Elephants frequently migrate into Goalpara, resulting in high numbers of fatal encounters with humans amid rampant deforestation.<br/>Some elephants there have been poisoned or shot by locals, while others have died on electric fences or on railways cutting through migration routes.</p>
