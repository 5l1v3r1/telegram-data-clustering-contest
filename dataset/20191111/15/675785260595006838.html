      <h1>Asda worker to sue supermarket after losing his job of 13 years in contract row</h1>
      <h2>Duncan Carson had spent 13 years working at Asda, but left after being told he had to sign a new contract that cut paid breaks and forced people to work bank holidays and weekends</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:46:02+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, Hayley Parker, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>A former worker plans to sue Asda after he lost his job when he refused to sign up to a new contract.</p>
      <p>Duncan Carson had spend 13 years working as a baker at the supermarket's Wolstanton branch, but is now one of the Asda employees let go because they wouldn't sign up to the new terms.</p>
      <p>Duncan said he plans to take the food giant to an employment tribunal, the <a href="https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/its-not-worth-paper-its-3523283">Stoke Sential reports</a> .</p>
      <p>"I think someone should stand up to them," he told the BBC. "What is the point in having a contract if they can unilaterally change it?"</p>
      <p>Asda gave its workers until midnight on November 2 to agree to new terms, which include unpaid breaks, changes to night shift payments and being called to work at shorter notice.</p>

      <p>The supermarket said 120,000 workers had agreed to the deal, and that fewer than 300 didn't sign the new contract.</p>
      <p>But Duncan insists the new contract is 'unacceptable'.</p>
      <p>He usually works from 6am until midday as a baker, which he says suits him as he is used to working mornings.</p>
      <p>The new contract means he could be asked to work any hours from 5am until midnight.</p>
      <p>Duncan told The I: "Asda's drive to keep prices down and share prices up mean everyone's doing OK apart from the staff, who are getting squeezed.</p>
      <p>"Contract 6 is completely inflexible. Staff are forced to work any bank holiday of the company's choosing, and will no longer be paid for their breaks. But the biggest issue for people, I think, is the inflexibility."</p>

      <p>He added: "Staff working day shifts are expected to make themselves available, in my case, from 5am until midnight, every day, for a shift.</p>
      <p>"Asda are acting as though there aren't any employment laws. When they told me I had to sign up or leave, I said I'm out.</p>
      <p>"If they've changed the contract before, when they said they wouldn't, then a contract isn't worth the paper it's written on.</p>
      <p>"Telling people they have to sign something whether they like it or not is no choice.</p>
      <p>"I was a shop steward, and attended more than 300 meetings about the new contract. People were so terrified they signed up to keep their jobs.</p>
      <p>"I am taking legal action against Asda because a contract is an agreement between the two parties. If one person can change that, it's not a contract. We have employment law in this country, and I can't get sacked unless I've been found to have done something wrong."</p>
      <p>Urging shoppers to spend the money elsewhere, Duncan added: "The only thing Asda understands is the bottom line. Contract 6 was made on the back of profitability, and my job is gone because they simply want to make more money."</p>

      <p>An Asda spokesman told Mirror Money: "Following a robust, fair and extensive consultation process, we’re pleased that almost 120,000 of our retail colleagues are now working on the same contract, with the same terms and conditions and the same enhanced benefits package, including an increased hourly rate.</p>
      <p>"This contract is about fairness for all our colleagues and moves us in line with our competitors.</p>
      <p>"We have always been clear that we understand people have responsibilities outside of work and we will always help them to balance these with their work life; we will not be asking them to constantly move the time they work, their days or departments.</p>
      <p>"We do not want anyone to leave us as a result of this necessary change and so we have written to the fewer than 300 colleagues who have not signed the contract to offer a little more time to sign up and continue to work with us, should they wish.</p>
      <p>"Whilst retail as a whole is under continued pressure, we will do all we can to ensure we have a sustainable business for our customers, our colleagues and the communities we serve.”</p>
