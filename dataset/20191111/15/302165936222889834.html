      <p>LONDON, Nov 11 — Granit Xhaka may have been stripped of the Arsenal captaincy due to his public run-in with the club’s fans but he says he will be staying and fighting for his place in the team.</p>
      <p>The volatile 27-year-old Swiss international midfielder has not played since he mouthed an obscenity at a section of Gunners fans jeering him when he was substituted in the Premier League match with Crystal Palace a fortnight ago.</p>
      <p>However, despite manager Unai Emery deciding he could not carry on as skipper — a role he was given after a secret ballot of the players — he told Swiss newspaper Blick he would not be leaving.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has had a fractious relationship with Arsenal supporters since his arrival from Bundesliga outfit Borussia Moenchengladbach in 2016, costing the Premier League side a fee reported to be £38 million (US$49 million).</p>
      <p>“You can be sure that I’ll keep fighting and putting myself out there in every training session,” Xhaka said.</p>
      <p>“I feel last week has been dealt with and I’m ready.</p>
      <p>“My time at Arsenal has been very positive for a long time.</p>
      <p>“After a difficult start, I played a lot and overall I’ve had a great time at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>“My family and I also feel very well in the city of London.”</p>
      <p>Xhaka, who has been linked with a move to struggling Newcastle in the January transfer window, said the boos and jeers has not altered his views of the city or the club.</p>
      <p>“I’ll continue to stay positive,” he said. “(To) give my all to an even greater extent and prove that I am an important part of this great team.”</p>
      <p>The 2-0 defeat by Leicester on Saturday left Arsenal with just one win in six Premier League games and eight points adrift of fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Xhaka and many of his teammates are now on a fortnight international break. Their next league game will be against second-from-bottom Southampton on November 23.</p>
      <p>Xhaka does concede the abuse hurt — he claimed his emotions were running high because his daughter had received online abuse — but said it was counter-productive for the whole team’s morale.</p>
      <p>“Insulting and swearing at your own captain will cause upset and a bad atmosphere for the team you are actually supposed to be supporting.</p>
      <p>“That makes no sense to me and weakens the team’s spirit.”</p>
      <p>He does not spare the online abusers either.</p>
      <p>“What has changed through social media are phenomena such as ‘sxxx storms’ that can over-run you from one minute to the next,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Also new is the cloak of anonymity you can use to attack players without fear of consequences.</p>
      <p>“What happened here is abnormal and excessive and there can be no justification for it.” — AFP</p>
