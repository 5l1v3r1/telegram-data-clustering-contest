      <h1>London Underground: Union threatens Christmas Tube strikes</h1>

      <p>There may be “significant disruption” on the London Underground during the Christmas period as rail workers decide on whether to engage in strike action.</p>
      <p>One thousand Tube cleaners from the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union today began voting on whether to take industrial action in a bid for better pay and amenities.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The cleaners are demanding an increase to their £19,029 annual salary and the same access to pensions and sick pay that other London Underground staff have.</p>
      <p>They are also fighting to gain free access to free Transport for London (TfL) travel, which all other Tube workers get.</p>
      <p>RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “It is scandalous that the people who do some of the hardest and dirtiest work on London’s transport network are treated differently to other London Underground staff.”</p>
      <p>The ballot on whether to strike ends next Tuesday and may lead to industrial action as soon as 2 December.</p>
      <p>There are around 2,000 cleaners employed to work at Tube stations across the capital, with half of them signed up as members of the RMT.</p>
      <p>Cash said the strikes could back the system up and cause delays throughout the Christmas period.</p>
      <p>“The cleaners on the London Underground are key to keeping services moving – if a train is soiled by a member of the public it cannot move on until it has been cleaned and that happens more often than you would think,” he said. </p>
      <p>“Any strike would cause significant disruption.”</p>
      <p>The cleaners are all hired by multinational outsourcing company AMB.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the US-based company said it offered pay and benefits that “compare favourably” to other UK cleaning companies.</p>
      <p>“We are disappointed that RMT is balloting its members for strike action,” they said.</p>
      <p>“A strike threatens unnecessary disruption and delay for the millions of customers that rely on the Tube every day.”</p>
      <p>If the cleaners go on strike they will join fellow <a href="https://www.cityam.com/rmt-union-announces-27-days-of-south-western-railway-strikes-in-december/">RMT members from South Western Railway (SWR), who are walking off the job for 27 days in December</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The SWR strikes will start on 2 December and last until the New Year, with only brief breaks around the 12 December election and Christmas day.</p>
      <p>CBI chief UK policy director Matthew Fell labelled the strike action as “deeply unfair to businesses, commuters and families in the busy run up to Christmas”.</p>
