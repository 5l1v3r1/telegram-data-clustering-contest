        <b>Wubba lubba dub dub! 'Rick and Morty' season 4 premieres in the US tonight (10 November)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since it debuted back in 2013, <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/rick-and-morty"><i>Rick and Morty</i></a> has enraptured millions and become a phenomenon of cult-like proportions. With fans now eagerly awaiting season 4, the big question is this: when’s it coming back?</p>
      <p>Information is now coming in thick and fast about the new episodes, so here’s everything we know so far about <i>Rick and Morty</i> season 4.</p>
      <h3>Latest updates</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>A new game reveals plot details of episode 1</li>
        <li>New trailer and release date confirmed.</li>
        <li>You could star in the new series</li>

      </ul>
      <h3>Does Rick and Morty season 4 have a release date?</h3>
      <p>Yes! It’s been confirmed that the show’s fourth outing will debut on November 10.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>News of the release date follows just a year on from a mammoth commission <i>Rick and Morty</i> received from its US network, Adult Swim. 70 episodes – yes, 70! – have been ordered, meaning that <i>Rick and Morty</i> could be on the air for a very, very long time to come.</p>
      <p>Co-creator Justin Roiland marked the news of the 70-episode commission in May 2018 with this special drawing of the titular characters.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Roiland told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/14/17464224/rick-and-morty-season-4-release-date-waiting-gap-justin-roiland-adult-swim"><i>Polygon</i></a> in June 2018 that he and his fellow writers had re-entered the writers’ room for season four: “It’s exciting, it’s a little surreal. Even just being in the writers room for half the day every day this week, the ideas are … it’s going to be great.”</p>
      <p>He also assured fans that the gaps between seasons would no longer be as lengthy as before. “We‘re super excited that, for the first time ever, we’re locked in, we know what the future is, we have job security,” Roiland said. “Harmon is in great spirits, we have a great writer’s room. We want the episodes to stay good, but we do also want to try to turn them around a little quicker now that we have this big order.”</p>
      <h3>When does Rick and Morty season 4 air in the UK?</h3>
      <p>After it was recently revealed that <i>Rick and Morty</i> season 4’s release date for the UK was in January 2020, fans weren’t too happy. So unhappy, in fact, that Channel 4 decided to bring the release forward to November, with the show now premiering on November 20 on E4, and also available to stream on All4.</p>
      <p>“When we announced we would be airing <i>Rick and Morty</i> Series 4 on free to air TV in January we thought fans would be delighted,” said Channel 4’s director of programmes, Ian Katz.</p>
      <p>“Instead they told us – in their droves – that it wasn’t nearly soon enough, so we’ve listened and brought forward the UK premiere to November 20th on E4 and All 4. Enjoy!”</p>
      <h3>Is there a trailer for Rick and Morty Season 4 yet?</h3>
      <p>Yes! The new trailer has finally arrived, and it shows that the pair are up to no good again. As a voice-over teases, “things are pretty much the same”.  Check out the trailer in full below.</p>

      <h3>Will Rick and Morty season 4 be on Netflix?</h3>
      <p>No. <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/rick-and-morty-season-4-to-air-exclusively-on-channel-4-2430739">Channel 4 will exclusively broadcast</a> the show’s fourth season, and it remains unclear whether previous seasons of <i>Rick and Morty</i> will remain on the streaming giant when Channel 4’s deal with Adult Swim becomes official.</p>
      <h3>Have we seen any official photos yet?</h3>
      <p>Yes! Check the below, where things are looking as mad as usual.</p>

      <h3>Is there any footage from Rick and Morty season 4?</h3>
      <p>Yes! At this year’s Comic-Con in San Diego, the show’s creators revealed the first scene to be shown from the upcoming season.</p>
      <p>The new clip sees Morty and his father fighting with Glootie, a fancy alien app developer voiced by <i>Thor</i> director Taika Waititi.</p>
      <p>Morty demands that Glootie removes an app he doesn’t like from the internet, and it leads to a bit of a scrap. Rick is nowhere to be seen in the clip.</p>

      <h3>How many episodes will there be in Rick and Morty season 4?</h3>
      <p>Dan Harmon initially expressed an interest in possibly making 14 episodes for season 4, but revealed in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/rick-and-morty-season-4-interview/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> that it would in fact be a 10-episode series.</p>
      <p>“I would like to think I’ve learned enough from my mistakes in season 3 that we could definitely do 14 now, but then I have to say, ‘Yeah but you’re the guy who says we can do 14 who turned out to be wrong so we’re not listening to you now,'” he told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2017/09/26/rick-morty-dan-harmon-interview/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> back in September 2017.</p>
      <p>“The nice healthy way to approach this is I want to prove it with the first 10 of season four — prove it to ourselves, to production, to the network — that it’s so easy that we’ll earn additional episodes.”</p>
      <h3>Any idea yet of any potential plot details?</h3>
      <p>Season 3 left us with plenty of questions: What happened to Evil Morty? Is there actually a Clone Beth? So, there’s every chance that season four could be used to tie up those – and many, many more – loose threads.</p>
      <p>There was a small clue about the content of season 4 in the finale of season 3. Beth made a meta comment about the family being reunited, saying that it would now be like season 1 “but more streamlined.” With Jerry and Beth’s divorce seemingly being called off, we could see more antics from the entire Smith family in season 4.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/rick-and-morty-season-4-interview/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>, co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland gave a little teaser as to what could unfold in the new season.</p>
      <p>“Without giving anything away, we have serialized stuff we check in on now and then that’s sprinkled over the top of strong episodic episodes,” Roiland said. “To fans of the show, they’re going to want to watch them in order.”</p>
      <p>In November 2019, a <i>Rick and Morty</i> board game gave some hints as to what to expect from the season premiere. Titled <i>Rick and Morty: The Morty Zone Dice Game</i>, the release centres entirely around episode 1.</p>
      <p>The game makes reference to “death crystals” which allow the characters to gain a glimpse of their “potential fates”. “Everything you do from now on could lead to a different end, but how do you get to your best death?” an official description reads. Players can also make use of ‘Secret Death Crystal Tokens’.</p>
      <h3>Any word on possible guest stars?</h3>
      <p><i>Rick and Morty</i> season 3 featured the likes of Peter Serafinowicz, Danny Trejo and Joel McHale – and there have now been a number of stars confirmed to pop up in the new season.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got Paul Giamatti,” Justin Roiland told <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/rick-and-morty-season-4-interview/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>. “That’s a hot scoop. We got Sam Neil. Taika Waititi does a voice. Kathleen Turner.”</p>

      <p>In July 2018, <i>Back to the Future’s </i>Christopher Lloyd expressed an interest in lending his voice to the show. Many fans will know that <i>Rick and Morty</i> is inspired by Lloyd’s character, Doc Brown, and Michael J. Fox’s Marty McFly from the 1985 sci-fi film.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/arts/christopher-lloyd-interview-rick-and-morty-back-to-the-future-4-donald-trump-10609141"><i>Phoenix New Times</i></a> about possibly starring in the new season, Lloyd said: “I’d like to, of course. I think it’s really fun. I don’t follow it closely, but I’ve seen a few episodes and I gotta tell you, I think it’s a lot of fun. I know it’s some kind of parody of Doc and Marty.”</p>
      <p>When asked if he would accept the role of Rick’s father, Lloyd replied: “That’d be fun.”</p>
      <p>Also – exciting news! – fans have the chance to star in the forthcoming season.</p>
      <p>As announced on the official Rick and Morty Twitter page in September, the show’s creators are offering fans the opportunity to be drawn into the season.</p>
      <p>Justin Roiland wrote: “Go to <a href="https://www.prizeo.com/campaigns/rick-and-morty/get-drawn-in?utm_campaign=adult-swims-rick-and-morty&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=rickandmorty&amp;utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Ft.co%2FdUTRNnX8qd">prizeo.com</a> and donate to NEXT for autism for a chance to win being drawn into an episode of Rick and Morty, hang out with us losers and see the studio where we make the show.”</p>

      <p>A lucky winner will go to LA to hang out with Roiland and co-creator Dan Harmon – and become a part of <i>Rick and Morty</i> history.</p>
      <p>The competition costs $10 (£8) to enter. Donations will support NEXT for AUTISM and Bergen County’s United Way.</p>
      <h3>Will Kanye West be in season 4?</h3>
      <p>It seems like, after rumours that Kanye West could be handed over his own episode of <i>Rick and Morty</i> in season 4, that the offer is still on the table, but won’t be featuring in the upcoming season.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to schedule something. It’s not going to be for this batch coming up,” Roiland confirmed to <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con/2019/07/17/rick-and-morty-season-4-interview/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> in July 2019. “But we love the idea of doing something with him. It’s just a discussion of what exactly that is, and then sitting down and talking with him. He had to reschedule, and then we had to reschedule. We need to sit down and chat about it. But it’s a very sincere and legitimate offer when we threw that out.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-meeting-rick-and-morty-creator-2312497">Kanye expressed his love for the Adult Swim show</a> back in May 2o18 as news broke about <i>Rick and Morty</i> being renewed for season 4. “This is the greatest news. This is my favourite show. I’ve seen every episode at least 5 times each,” he tweeted at the time. He even <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-meeting-rick-and-morty-creator-2312497">invited co-creator Justin Roiland to hang out</a>.</p>
      <p>Since then, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-offered-rick-morty-episode-2488687">Harmon and Roiland have invited Kanye to helm his very own episode of <i>Rick and Morty</i></a>. “I’m giving him an episode, I’m making it official,” Harmon told <a href="https://youtu.be/3-XwnAsYdJ0"><i>The Blast</i></a> in May 2019. “We have 70 [episodes], he can have one — Kanye, you can have an episode.” Calling Kanye a “kindred spirit,” Harmon’s co-creator Roiland then added, “We fucking love Kanye.”</p>
      <p>“Come hang out, write a <i>Rick and Morty</i> episode with us. It’ll be the Kanye episode.”</p>
      <h3>What about old characters returning for Rick and Morty season 4?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>We don’t know for certain about any returning characters yet – but we do know that one fan favourite, Butter Bot, won’t be returning. In a 2018 advert that the producers of <i>Rick and Morty</i> created for Old Spice, we saw the beloved robot being brutally murdered as he’s eaten by a massive anthropomorphic can of Old Spice.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>One character that fans of <i>Rick and Morty</i> would love to see again is Pickle Rick. Adult Swim have capitalised on the huge popularity of Rick’s pickle experiment by releasing audio outtakes of Roiland recording one scene from that episode – check it out above.</p>
