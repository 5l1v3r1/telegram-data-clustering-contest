      <p>A <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> dog who defied the odds and survived through risky surgery has been nominated for a national award.</p>
      <p>Pomeranian Milo was picked up by Naomi Weir and her family from a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">puppy</a> farm - but it wasn’t long until they realised that there was something not quite right with him.</p>
      <p>The cute pup was clumsy and kept bumping into things while it was going about his day to day business.</p>
      <p>His new owners rushed Milo to Sandyhill Vets in Glasgow, where she was advised that he had a hereditary eye problem.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The dog, who was just eight months at the time, started crying in pain and further x-rays revealed a concerning cause for this.</p>
      <p>His neck bones were found to be badly deformed and out of place, meaning that any wrong turn of his head could have left him completely paralysed.</p>
      <p>Milo was then referred to a specialist vet in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stirling">Stirling</a> to undergo urgent six-hour spinal surgery - fitting the puppy with plates and screws to hold his vertebrae in place.</p>
      <p>After a few weeks of strict cage rest, Milo’s owners carefully increased his activity levels to the extent where he is now running around and enjoying his life.</p>

      <p>It’s believed that Milo is one of the few survivors of puppy farms, with many having suffered parvovirus and other illnesses.</p>
      <p>Naomi Weir said: “We reported what happened and we now know exactly what to look out for when buying a puppy in future. We wouldn’t change Milo for the world, but I don’t ever want to put another dog through what he’s had to go through. If they’d done the right health checks on the parents and not bred from unhealthy dogs, this might all have been prevented.”</p>
      <p>Milo is now up against five other miracle pets, each with their own death-defying tales of survival, as part of PDSA’s national Pet Survivor 2019 competition.</p>
      <p>The six pet finalists were selected from entrants from all over the UK by a judging panel which included TV presenter Michaela Strachan, vet and TV presenter Judy Puddifoot, and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/love-island">Love Island</a> star Kady McDermott.</p>
      <p>Jacques Penderis, European Specialist in Veterinary Neurology, said: “Milo needed a lengthy operation to correct his spinal deformity, but has made an excellent recovery.</p>
      <p>“He is such a lovely happy dog, and his owner was completely dedicated to his care – PDSA could not have picked more deserving finalists for Pet Survivor.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">Pet</a> Survivor judge Michaela Strachan said: “Milo’s story is such a sad example of the horrendous breeding standards in puppy farms. It’s amazing that Milo is still alive, and I hope that he can be an ambassador to deter people from buying puppies from unscrupulous breeders.”</p>
      <p>Public voting for the competition closes at midnight on Sunday, December 1 and the results will be announced before Christmas.</p>
      <p>The winner will receive a trophy, a luxury pet hamper worth £200 and the coveted title of PDSA Pet Survivor.</p>
