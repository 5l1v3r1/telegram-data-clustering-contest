      <p>A substitute teacher who allegedly repeatedly punched a student in the face before stomping on their head has been fired and arrested.</p>
      <p>Footage emerged appearing to show <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tiffani-shadell-lankford">Tiffani Shadell Lankford</a>, 32, attacking the student at Lehman High School in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kyle">Kyle</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Texas">Texas</a>.</p>
      <p>In the video, the substitute teacher appears to repeatedly punch the girl in the face before dragging her to the floor and stomping on her head.</p>
      <p>Ms Lankford was charged with aggravated assault, the Hays county Sheriff’s Office said.</p>
      <p>She was also fired from the Hays Consolidated Independent School District (CISD).</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old victim’s family said she has special needs and suffers from seizures.</p>
      <p>Their attorney <a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/student-in-lehman-high-school-assault-video-speaks-out-about-incident/269-43991250-65fc-4d26-bf6e-712d3189ff8f">told KVUE-TV</a> she was treated for severe injuries after the attack.</p>
      <p>“There is absolutely no excuse or circumstance that can justify what you see unfold on the video,” Tim Savoy, a spokesman for Hays CISD <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/09/us/texas-substitute-teacher-fired-hitting-student/index.html">told CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>“It is unconscionable what this adult did to one of our students.”</p>
      <p>Lankford had undergone training and passed a background check, Hays CISD said in a statement.</p>
      <p>She had worked in classrooms in the district 18 times since 13 September.</p>
