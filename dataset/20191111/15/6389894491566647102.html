      <h1>Meet our City A.M. PA Awards Judges - Leonid Shutov</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T15:39:31+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">City A.M. Events</a></address>
      <p>Leonid Shutov is the owner and CEO of Bob Bob Ricard and Bob Bob Cité</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bob Bob Cité opened in the summer of this year after much anticipation – how have your first few months been?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Very busy and very exciting – there is always much to do when a restaurant first opens. We have been talking to our customers, listening to their thoughts and comments and looking for ways to improve our offer even further.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What makes Bob Bob Cité unique?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s the unique combination of classic French country cooking (which would not be out of place in a 1920s brasserie) with possibly the most urban interior that can only exist in an early 21<sup>st</sup>-century, Richard Roger’s-designed skyscraper.</p>
      <p>Meet another judge: <a href="https://www.cityam.com/meet-our-city-a-m-pa-awards-judges-alice-scutchey/">Alice Scutchey Senior Executive Assistant, Citi and Founder &amp; Director, The Canary Wharf PA Club</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Why did you choose the City for your next location?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The City is without doubt one of the most exciting parts of London (or the world, for that matter) – the mix of old and new architecture, of ancient history and the modern day is unlike anywhere else.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How much personal input did you have on the interior design at BBC?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot. It was a truly collaborative effort with Shayne Brady of BradyWilliams Design (just like it was with David Collins on Bob Bob Ricard). In fact, after nearly 3 years of design and build, once Bob Bob Cité was finished, it felt odd not to have daily contact and interactions.</p>
      <p><b>What qualities are you looking for in City A.M PA of the year?</b> A thorough understanding of what drives and ensures their superior’s success.</p>
