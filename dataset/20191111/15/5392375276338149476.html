      <p>Oppo has finally revealed the launch date of ColorOS 7 in India. According to the media invite sent out by the <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/news/coloros-7-release-date-india-november-26-oppo-2130867">company,</a> the next iteration of ColorOS will be unveiled in the country on November 26. It will succeed the ColorOS 6 found on Oppo and Realme smartphones with revamped design and a new host of features including a system-wide dark mode.</p>
      <p>Last week, Oppo announced they will be holding an event in China on 20th November to introduce ColorOS 7 formally. And now, Oppo India has also done the same for the Indian premiere of the OS. The upcoming ColorOS 7 will be most likely based on Android 10 for premium and some mid-range budget smartphones. But it will be also available for older and budget smartphones based on previous Android versions later on.Â </p>

      <p>Madhav Seth, CEO of Realme India has previously <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/10/24/color-os-7-incoming-exclusively-for-realme-phones/">confirmed</a> that ColorOS 7 will be rolled out to Realme smartphones as well. But it will differ by offering a near-stock experience which will be not the case with Oppo smartphones. On the other hand, Realme is yet to disclose the list of models eligible for the update which we hope to be announced at the Realme X2 launch on November 20.</p>
      <p>We expect Oppo India to reveal all the new features of ColorOS 7, eligible devices, and update timeline at launch on November 26.</p>
