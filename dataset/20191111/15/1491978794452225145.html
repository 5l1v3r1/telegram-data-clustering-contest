        <i>Ex-secretary of state says it is unacceptable to keep report from public before election</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> has called Downing Street’s suppression of a report into potential Russian infiltration of British politics “damaging, inexplicable and shaming”.</p>
      <p>The 2016 US presidential candidate told the Guardian it was “incredibly surprising and unacceptable that in your country there is a government report sitting there about Russian influence and your current government isn’t releasing it”.</p>
      <p>The potentially incendiary report by the intelligence and security committee has already been approved by the intelligence agencies. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last month.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/04/no-10-blocks-russia-eu-referendum-report-until-after-election">No 10 indicated that the parliamentary report would not be made public before the election</a>, citing a sign-off process that it said could take six weeks. The chairman of the committee, Dominic Grieve, called the decision to delay publication “jaw-dropping”.</p>
      <p>Clinton said: “I mean, who do they<b> </b>think they are that they would keep information like that from the public, especially before an election?</p>
      <p>“Well, I’ll tell you who they think they are. They think that they are the all-powerful, strong men who should be ruling,” she said, linking the suppression of the report to a rising authoritarian turn in western leaders.</p>
      <p>The report specifically examines attempts by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> to affect the outcome of the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>That there was Russian influence in the 2016 presidential campaign is now widely accepted – though denied by Donald Trump who describes it as “a hoax”.</p>
      <p>Clinton said: “Someone said to me: ‘Quit with the Russians’. “I said: ‘I’ll quit with the Russians when the Russians quit with us’. That’s how I feel.”</p>
      <p>She left open the possibility of a presidential run in 2020. “I would have been a good president, so obviously that lives in the back of my head. I’m going to do everything I possibly can to make sure we retire the current incumbent.”</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier, at the Royal Festival Hall in London on Sunday, Clinton said she was afraid to see Britain “sort of shrink up and turn inward”.</p>
      <p>She was anxious, she said, about Britain trying “to separate yourselves from Europe at a time when democracies need to stick together because we are truly under pressure from dictatorships and authoritarian regimes”.</p>
      <p>At the event promoting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/06/hillary-and-chelsea-clinton-co-write-the-book-of-gutsy-women">The Book of Gutsy Women</a>, co-authored with her daughter, Chelsea, the former US secretary of state said: “I am, as a great admirer of Britain, concerned, because I can’t make sense of what is happening.</p>
      <p>“We have a president who admires dictators and takes their help and does all kinds of crazy stuff. So we need you to be the sane member of this partnership going forward.”</p>
      <p>• The full interview with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton will appear in Guardian Review on Saturday 16 November.</p>
