      <p>A MEMBER of Mayo County Council has highlighted the value of CCTV in Ballinrobe since it was installed in 2011.</p>
      <p>Councillor Michael Burke said it has proved very successful in tackling anti-social behaviour and other issues.</p>
      <p>Such has been its success, the community invested about €40,000 in maintaining and upgrading it over the past eight years.</p>
      <p>However, it is time for the garda authorities to take a bigger responsibility and not ask a community to sustain it, added Councillor Burke.</p>
