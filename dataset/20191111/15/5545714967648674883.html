      <h2>Just watching this Domination record makes my thumb ache</h2>

      <p>Win or lose, I've literally never ended a round of <i>Mario Party 4 </i>feeling good about myself, my fellow players, or this wretched game – and yet I always come crawling back after enough time has passed. That's how it's always been, and that's how it'll always be. Why <i>Mario Party 4</i>? It's just what I have!</p>
      <p>A breakout <i>Mario Party</i> clip from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ludwig">Twitch streamer ludwig</a> circulated over the weekend, and for good reason: it's as impressive as it is painful. Watch him mash like a madman in the Domination minigame.</p>
      <p>Not only did Ludwig wail on his controller fast enough to earn 201 points in this endurance-testing minigame – a remarkable feat in its own right – he did it while playing as Luigi. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../remember-the-year-of-luigi-well-it-s-back-in-month-form-568730.phtml">Way to represent</a>.</p>
      <p>There's a strange satisfaction in watching someone else <i>wreck the shit</i> out of a video game that has caused so much misfortune. I feel like Ludwig just got revenge on <i>Mario Party 4 </i>on our behalf.</p>
      <p>I also now feel like my thumb has a phantom secondhand soreness.</p>
