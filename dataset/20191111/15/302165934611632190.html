      <p>WASHINGTON, Nov 11 — The World Bank announced today it was ending a project to fund vocational schools in China following allegations of mistreatment of minority Muslim Uighurs.</p>
      <p>The World Bank launched another review of the programme in late August after <i>Foreign Policy</i> magazine reported that a school that benefited from a tranche of the US$50 million (RM207.1 million) loan to China bought “barbed wire, gas launchers, and body armour.” </p>
      <p>The Washington-based development lender said it launched another review in the wake of the charges but “did not substantiate the allegations.” </p>
      <p>However, “In light of the risks associated with the partner schools, which are widely dispersed and difficult to monitor, the scope and footprint of the project is being reduced.”</p>
      <p>“Specifically, the project component that involves the partner schools in Xinjiang is being closed,” the World Bank said in a statement.</p>
      <p>China’s treatment of the Uighurs — a mostly Muslim, Turkic-speaking minority concentrated in the tightly-controlled northwestern Xinjiang region — has come under growing scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Rights groups and experts say more than one million mostly Muslim ethnic minorities have been interned in re-education camps in Xinjiang, where they are being tortured and forced to renounce their religion.</p>
      <p>China initially denied the existence of the camps before admitting to running what it called “vocational education centers,” which it presented as necessary to combat religious extremism and boost employment.</p>
      <p>World Bank funding to five schools in the project will, however, continue. — AFP</p>
