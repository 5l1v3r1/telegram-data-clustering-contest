      <p>PUTRAJAYA, Nov 11 — Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) is confident of winning the Tanjung Piai by-election, with signs showing many voters who supported the Barisan Nasional (BN) in the last general election are now supporting Pakatan Harapan (PH), said Bersatu chairman Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
      <p>“We are aware of the problems there (Tanjung Piai), we believe we can address the problems,” he told reporters after chairing Bersatu Supreme Council meeting here today.</p>
      <p>However, Dr Mahathir said there are still constituents in who still regard him as Umno president.</p>
      <p>“This, we have to face. I’m no longer Umno president. I am now Bersatu chairman and PH Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>“I’ll go to the ground to campaign this Wednesday (Nov 13) and hope by then, they no longer regard me as Umno president.</p>
      <p>Asked whether his presence in the Tanjung Piai by-election campaign would be a crowd puller to get the locals to attend the “ceramah” (political talks) organised by PH, Dr Mahathir said: “I don’t know, we see the day after tomorrow”.</p>
      <p>This Saturday (November 16) is polling for the Tanjung Piai by-election, which is called following the death of the incumbent Member of Parliament Datuk Dr Md Farid Md Rafik, 42, last Sept 21 due to heart complications.</p>
      <p>The PH candidate in the by-election is Karmaine Sardini, who is vying for the seat against Barisan Nasional (BN), Gerakan, Berjasa dan two Independent candidates.</p>
      <p>On the number of Bersatu members, Dr Mahathir said the number was increasing, with the highest number in Sabah, totalling about 500,000 since. — Bernama</p>
