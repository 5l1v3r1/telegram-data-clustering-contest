      <p>The Portuguese superstar was substituted off in the 55th minute of the Bianconeri's 1-0 Serie A victory over Milan on Sunday, a decision from manager Maurizio Sarri that prompted an enraged response from the 34-year-old, who walked straight down the tunnel after leaving the pitch.</p>
      <p>After the match, goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny seemed to show his support for the former Real Madrid striker, before adding that Ronaldo is currently not at his physical best.</p>

      <p>"When a player of this level is replaced after 50 minutes, it is normal that he gets angry," the Poland goalkeeper told <i>Sky Sports.</i></p>
      <p>"He is a great player, but now he is not well physically. His quality must not be doubted at all because, when the decisive moments of the season arrive, he will surely give us a big hand as always."</p>
      <p>Juventus manager Sarri also discussed the issue after the game, and also appeared to hint at Ronaldo not being fully fit.</p>
