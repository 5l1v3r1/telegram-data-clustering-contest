      <p>Pete Doherty has been arrested in France for the second time in the space of a week.</p>
      <p>The Paris prosecutor's office said the 40-year singer was placed in custody on Sunday for "violence by a person in a manifest state of intoxication".</p>
      <p>Doherty is a former frontman for the Libertines and Babyshambles.</p>
      <p>Last week, Doherty was arrested in Paris for buying cocaine, French authorities have said.</p>
      <p>The Paris prosecutor's office said the 40-year old was placed in detention during the night after being stopped by police during a drugs transaction.</p>
      <p>Officials would not confirm French media reports that Doherty was carrying two grams of cocaine and was arrested in Pigalle, an area known for its late-night bars.</p>
      <p>Since rising to fame in the noughties, ex-Warwickshire schoolboy Doherty, the former boyfriend of model Kate Moss, has been repeatedly arrested for drug offences.</p>
