      <p>Emergency services are searching through rubble after part of Lewes Castle in Sussex collapsed - sending 500 tonnes of Medieval wall crumble onto to nearby buildings.</p>
      <p>Sussex Police confirmed its officers were assisting East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service with the ongoing incident.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported multiple emergency vehicles at the scene, as well as a helicopter and dog unit.</p>
      <p>According to East Sussex Fire and Rescue teams, the area of wall collapse is not part of the main castle and not immediately accessible by the public.</p>
      <p>They said there were no immediate reports of anyone missing but a "multi-agency search and rescue operation" is ongoing.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said: "A search of the area is not yet underway, due to the instability of the Old Coach House. ESFRS is working with other emergency services to gain a safe access.</p>
