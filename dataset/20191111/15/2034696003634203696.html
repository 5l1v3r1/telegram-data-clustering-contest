        <b>New service will try to omit dated shows</b>
      </p>
      <p>New streaming service <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/britbox-bbc-itv-team-new-streaming-service-2454672">BritBox</a> will not include some shows after deeming them “inappropriate” for modern audiences.</p>
      <p>The new subscription-based service launched in the UK last week with the aim to rival streaming giants such as <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> and Amazon by offering a wide array of British shows.</p>
      <p>However, some shows have not been put on the service because they contain content that is deemed racist or unacceptable, such as <i>Till Death Do Us Part</i>,<i> Love Thy Neighbour </i>and<i> It Ain’t Half Hot Mum.</i></p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p><i>Till Death Do Us Part</i> includes the bigoted character Alf Garnett, while<i> Love Thy Neighbour</i> features a West Indian couple who move next door to a white English couple.</p>
      <p>Episodes of shows such as <i>Only Fools and Horses </i>and<i> Fawlty Towers</i>, which could be considered inappropriate by modern audiences, will come with offensive language warnings.</p>
      <p>“[BritBox] is a selection [of shows],” ITV executive Reemah Sakaan told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/07/britbox-uk-networks-plan-to-tackle-netflix-amazon-and-apple-tv"><i>The Guardian</i></a>. “We also recomply everything that goes on to BritBox [with modern TV viewing standards]. There’s also the ability to create bespoke warnings around key programming.”</p>

      <p>An ITV spokesperson added: “We’ve carefully selected a wide range of the very best in British programming which will appeal to viewers in 2019.”</p>
      <p>Following the launch of BritBox, a spokesperson confirmed that the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/majority-of-british-tv-shows-on-netflix-will-be-axed-from-platform-in-the-next-year-2565707">“vast majority”</a> of British shows will disappear from Netflix within the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>As most BBC and ITV shows have been licences to Netflix and Amazon on rolling 12 month contracts, those shows will move to BritBox once those have expired.</p>
      <p>ITV group communications and corporate affairs director Paul Moore confirmed that shows such as <i>The Office</i> will “be coming back home next spring”, though co-productions between the UK channels and services such as Netflix or Amazon, such as <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/bodyguard-actually-modern-day-retelling-romeo-juliet-2377895"><i>Bodyguard</i></a>, “can’t come back home”.</p>
