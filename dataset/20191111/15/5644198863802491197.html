      <p>REUTERS: One new case of measles was reported this weekend in the United States, with the country suffering its worst outbreak of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease in close-to three decades.</p>
      <p>The measles case was confirmed on Saturday in an unvaccinated resident of the southeastern U.S. state of Georgia, according to the state's health department.</p>

      <p>The measles outbreak, which began in New York in October 2018, has largely been linked to parents who declined to vaccinate their children. It threatens to end United States' measles-free status.</p>
      <p>As of Oct. 3, the country had recorded 1,250 cases of measles this year from across 31 states.</p>
      <p>The individual may have exposed others to the measles virus between Oct. 31 and Nov. 6 and the Georgia Department of Public Health said it was notifying those people.</p>
