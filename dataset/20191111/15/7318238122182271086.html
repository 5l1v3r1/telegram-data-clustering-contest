      <h1>British Steel secures sales contract with China's Jingye Group</h1>

      <p>China's Jingye Steel will acquire the "business and assets" of British Steel, the UK government's Insolvency Service <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/british-steel-limited-in-liquidation-information-for-customers-employees-and-creditors">announced on Monday.</a></p>
      <p>Britain's second-largest steelmaker was forced into liquidation in May, notably threatening thousands of jobs in Scunthorpe, a town in northeast England.</p>
      <p>The government did not reveal the cost of the agreement, though in May it was reported the company needed to secure £75m (€85m).</p>

      <p>The government announced the sales contract with the Chinese steel group on its website but stipulated that the "completion of the contract is conditional on a number of matters" including "regulatory approvals."</p>
      <p>Jingye Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Gareth Stace, director-general of lobby group UK Steel, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the purchase would "complement" Jingye's production and that it was a welcome investment from the Chinese group.</p>
      <p>In August, a Turkish fund was reported to be <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/09/turkish-fund-seen-favourite-to-take-over-british-steel">the front-runner</a> to buy the steelmaker.</p>
