      <p>A former Kaizer Chiefs teammate has heaped high praise on Itumeleng Khune’s free kick-taking ability, likening it to that of Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>Siyabonga Nkosi did not hold back when it came to showering Khune with praise while working as a pundit in the Mamelodi Sundowns Vs Golden Arrows match.</p>

      <p>The former Chiefs star spoke highly of Khune’s free-kick prowess, likening him to the great CR7.</p>
      <p>“He takes the best free kicks you know. I always encouraged him to take them. Out of ten he would score seven in the top corner, the Cristiano Ronaldo type of shots,” the 38-year-old can be heard saying.</p>

      <p>Khune, who was amused by the praise, took to Instagram to share a clip on his story.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen when Khune will be returning the field of play to challenge for the Amakhosi number one jersey, let alone taking free kicks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Having heard Nkosi’s words, do you think Khune should take up set-piece duties when he returns to the Chiefs starting XI?</b>
