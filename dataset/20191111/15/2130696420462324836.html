      <h1>OCBC, DBS PayLah! to integrate with Google Pay by early 2020</h1>

      <p>DBS and OCBC Bank are tying up with tech giant Google, with both Singapore banks due to launch Google Pay services with PayLah! and PayNow by early 2020. </p>
      <p>OCBC Bank customers will be the first in Singapore to be able to link their bank accounts on Google Pay to make peer-to-peer funds transfers via PayNow, in addition to enabling credit cards on the app to make online and in-store payments. The service, now in beta-testing phase, will be available in open-beta in January 2020.</p>
      <p>Users of Google Pay can also earn rewards that will go directly into the user's bank account, said Caesar Sengupta, Google's vice-president of payments and leading the next billion users initiative, in a press statement. </p>
      <p>OCBC Bank's chief operating officer Ching Wei Hong said: "In today's digital world, building ecosystems of partnerships and going beyond traditional banking products is critical.</p>
      <p>"This is a bold move which I believe will have great impact and bring significant scale to PayNow by expanding payment journeys for consumers."</p>

      <p>DBS's collaboration with Google includes the integration of PayLah!’s peer-to-peer and peer-to-merchant transaction services. </p>
      <p>The integration will allow DBS PayLah! customers to send and receive funds, and pay some 80,000 merchants in Singapore via Google Pay using a single-click sign-up.</p>
      <p>"This collaboration demonstrates our commitment towards building wholly seamless, intuitive services for our customers,” said DBS Bank chief strategy officer Han Kwee Juan in a press statement. </p>
      <p>In September 2019, DBS said it would more than double DBS PayLah!'s existing user base of 1.6 million to 3.5 million by 2023.</p>
      <p>"We are delighted to partner with DBS in our mission to make mobile payments simple, helpful and secure," said Google's Mr Sengupta. </p>
      <p>"Through this collaboration, we hope to make that a day-to-day reality for Singaporeans."</p>
      <p>Google Pay in Singapore will be enabled across both iOS and Android devices. </p>
      <p>Singapore is the second country to launch the enhanced version of Google Pay after it was introduced in India in 2017.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged Singaporeans to go bigger on e-payments in a National Day Rally speech in 2017, the same year PayNow was launched in the Republic. </p>
      <p>There are more than three million registered individual PayNow users and 129,000 business PayNow users. Since its launch in June 2017, more than S$12 billion have been transferred.  </p>
