      <p>This week’s action saw a healthy dose of Absa Premiership action reach our screens. However, the Soweto Derby, in particular, was certainly the pick of the weekend’s fixtures and it didn’t fail to disappoint.</p>
      <p>In Friday’s late kick-off between Bidvest Wits and SuperSport United, Matsatsantsa snatched all three points late on, with a Sipho Mbule header. </p>
      <p>The second Soweto Derby of the season was nothing short of spectacular. A five-goal thriller, filled with goals, cards, and great entertainment. Viewed by many as the best derby in years, Kaizer Chiefs came away the happier side, as they extended their lead to 10 points at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Norman Mapeza earned Chippa United’s first victory of the season, away to AmaZulu in the heavy KZN rain. </p>
      <p>Sunday saw a shock result, as Steve Khompela’s Golden Arrows defeated reigning Absa Premiership champions, Mamelodi Sundowns, in a wet and muddy Harry Gwala Stadium. </p>
      <p>With that brief summary of the weekend’s results, have a go at selecting your Team of the Week and see how close you get to the official Soccer Laduma selection. </p>
