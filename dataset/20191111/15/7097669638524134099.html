      <p>Former Vice President Joe Biden seems to feel his 2020 run may be faltering. His campaign aides still reportedly don't want to tell him that.</p>
      <p>Biden's presidential campaign has all the trappings of a winning run: An experienced, beloved politician with a tragically heroic backstory, Edward-Isaac Dovere <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/joe-biden-2020-frontrunner/601720/">describes in <i>The Atlantic</i>.</a> But polls and fundraising totals are showing Biden isn't thriving the way he'd hope, and his staffers are reportedly struggling to claim otherwise.</p>

That fact has led some aides to "feel like they're just spinning one another in staff meetings about how well things are going," some tell <i>The Atlantic</i> â€” and even Biden himself is reportedly "realizing with dread that the race might be slipping away."</p>
      <p>When asked about his supposedly falling campaign, Biden unequivocally defended his fundraising and organizing. Read more at <i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/joe-biden-2020-frontrunner/601720/">The Atlantic</a></i>.</p>
