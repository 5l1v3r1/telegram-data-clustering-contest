      <p>How many people still buy stuff on Blu-ray these days? I know I'm not the only one, because they keep releasing more and more of them for outrageous prices. So outrageous, in fact, that it's a nice day to see that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/deal/d63e4517/ref=gbps_tit_m-8_ded1_c8819141?moreDeals=882b2f5c,537b1efb&amp;switchToNewDLP=true&amp;smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_p=19f4ecbb-bde8-4ac0-b506-b42f9badded1&amp;pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-8&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_i=18978259031&amp;pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;pf_rd_r=5CQH7RYQ8H9894S3910E">Amazon has knocked up to 20% off 4K discs</a> for all the people that still go out and buy them.</p>
      <p>This is all part of Amazon's 'Hidden Gems' sale, which totally isn't a pre-pre-Black Friday sale at all. Nuh uh. Though the films in here are not exactly what I'd call hidden gems, since they include two Attenborough documentary series (netting a 15 per cent discount each), a bunch of films with Stallone (including two <i>Rambo</i> movies), and more.</p>
      <p>Sadly not a whole lot is available on the sale page, though a quick search round the deals sites found that there are plenty of other 4K discs on offer right now. Films like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingsman-The-Secret-Service-4K-Blu-ray/dp/B01C8LXJP6"><i>Kingsman</i></a>, <i>I<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Independence-Day-4K-Blu-ray/dp/B01FFOJ9TI">ndependence Day</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deadpool-4K-Blu-ray/dp/B01ELF4L4A">Deadpool</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alien-4K-Blu-ray/dp/B07MWNJ58N">Alien: 40th Anniversary Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Revenant-4K-Blu-ray/dp/B01CVMT03W">The Revenant</a>, </i>and more, so make sure to have a browse.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to check out all the other deals on offer too. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/goldbox/ref=Oct_DLandingS_dsk_shop_all_deals">You may find a few Hidden Gems of your own.</a></p>
