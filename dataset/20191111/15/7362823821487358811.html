      <h1>Kamala Harris releases never-before-seen video from 2016 election night: 'This is some s***'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 presidential</a> hopeful Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a>, D-Calif., released a never-before-seen video of her reaction to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s 2016 election victory, in which she told supporters they needed to be prepared to fight because "this is some s**."</p>
      <p>Harris gathered with supporters and told the story of her godson crying at the prospect of Trump defeating <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/the-clintons">Hillary Clinton</a> to win the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">White House</a>. She then used an expletive to highlight how dire she felt America's situation became after Trump's win.</p>
      <p>"So we just had a small family dinner. And many of you have met my godson, Alexander," she began. "So Alexander came up to me about twenty minutes ago, and he was teary. And... I said come here, little man. What's going on? And he looked up at me, I swear to God, he looked up at me and he said, 'I don't want Trump to win. Did he win?' And he's crying."</p>
      <p>Harris shared the clip on Twitter late Friday.</p>
      <p>"So the tears of joy we shed when we elected <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a>, and then my little godson's tears tonight, because we might have elected Donald Trump -- this is some s***."</p>

      <p>Harris used profanity again to illustrate her view that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/climate-change">climate change</a> and immigration would worsen under a Trump presidency, before comparing her supporters to superheroes.</p>

      <p>"Be prepared to fight and to roll up our sleeves and fight," she said. "I need you guys for what we are going to need to do now going forward because I think our campaign is actually not over. But it's a different kind of campaign. It's not to win an office. But it's going to be a campaign to fight for everything that motivated us to run for this office in the first place.</p>
      <p>"I think there is no question that everything that we have been talking about in terms of everything from criminal justice reform to climate change, to immigration, this s**t is now really on the line," Harris continued. "We have to be like superheroes... We're going to have to fight."</p>
