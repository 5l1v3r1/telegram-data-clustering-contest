      <p>Molde claimed their fourth Norwegian league title since 2011 as midfielder Magnus Wolff Eikrem returned from injury to score one goal and create another in a 4-0 home win over struggling Stroemsgodset on Sunday.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Molde claimed their fourth Norwegian league title since 2011 as midfielder Magnus Wolff Eikrem returned from injury to score one goal and create another in a 4-0 home win over struggling Stroemsgodset on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Runners-up in 2017 and 2018, Molde have 62 points with 28 of 30 games played, 10 more than Bodoe/Glimt in second and a whopping 17 ahead of fourth-placed Rosenborg.</p>

      <p>An ankle injury forced former Manchester United youth player Eikrem to miss more than a month, but the playmaker returned for Sunday's home game and teed up Ohi Omoijuanfo for the opening goal in the 19th minute.</p>
      <p>Eikrem added a second in the 34th minute and was substituted on the hour mark to tumultuous applause before Leke James struck twice to complete the rout and start the celebrations.</p>
      <p>Having won the first two titles in the club's history in 2011 and 2012 under current Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Molde added a third in 2014 before Rosenborg went on a four-year run of league victories.</p>
      <p>The loss to Molde dropped 2013 champions Stroemsgodset into the relegation places with 26 points, two ahead of bottom side Ranheim and one behind Mjoendalen in 14th spot.</p>
