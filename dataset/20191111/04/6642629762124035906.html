      <p>A Malaysian court on Monday ruled that former Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/najib-razak.html">Najib Razak</a> will have to defend himself against seven counts of criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power in a case linked to the multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB.</p>
      <p>Najib, 66, who faces dozens of criminal charges over accusations that $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, told the court he would testify in his defence.</p>
      <p>In the first case against him, which <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/malaysia-najib-razak-trial-1mdb-corruption-trial-190403100502136.html">began in April</a>, Najib is accused of receiving illegal transfers of 42 million ringgit ($10 million) from SRC International, a unit of 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>"The accused had enormous and overarching influence" over the 1MDB unit, SRC International, the judge told the court.<br/><br/>"It was under the control of the accused from day one. The accused wielded considerable power."</p>

      <p>Najib, who remains free on bail, was in court for the decision and hung his head as the ruling was read out.</p>
      <p>He told the court he would take the stand in his defence with the case due to start on December 3.</p>
      <p>If the former prime minister, who was <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/malaysia-opposition-pulls-shocking-election-win-180509184811723.html">removed</a> in elections in May 2018, is convicted he will face lengthy jail terms of between 15 and 20 years for each charge, as well as hefty fines.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Tommy Thomas opened the trial in April by saying that the former prime minister and finance minister was "directly involved" in decision-making at SRC, where he was an adviser, and 1MDB, where he was chairman of the fund's board of advisers.</p>
      <p>In summing up the prosecution's case, which involved 57 witnesses, Thomas said that there was "overwhelming evidence" against Najib.</p>
      <p>Najib's defence has argued that the prime minister was not aware of what was happening and was misled by others, including Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who is now a fugitive.</p>
      <p>A second 1MDB trial began in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/malaysia-pm-najib-razak-biggest-1mdb-trial-underway-190828021142513.html">August</a> with Najib facing 25 charges in that case.</p>
