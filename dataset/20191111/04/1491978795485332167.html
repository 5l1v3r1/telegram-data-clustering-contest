        <b>WARNING: SOME VIEWERS MAY FIND THIS FOOTAGE DISTRESSING.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A video captured by local media shows a police officer firing three live rounds at demonstrators in Sai Wan. The footage shows an officer struggling to subdue one protester before shooting another in the torso at close range. The protester falls to the ground before the officer fires twice more. The video, taken by Cupid Producer, was circulated widely online on Monday morning after protesters blocked public transit stations during the morning rush hour</p>

          <i>Editor's note: In response to your comments, we would like to explain why we chose not to show the precise moment this young man was shot by police at point-blank range. This was a very conscious decision by our editorial team out of respect to the wounded man and his family. This choice is in line with the Guardian's values and editorial code.
