      <h1>After Four Years On Ice, E! Reheats Some Delicious <i>Soup</i></h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:39:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:39</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>If you reheated 22-year-old soup after four years, you’d almost certainly die. If E! reheats <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/the-soup/"><i>The Soup</i></a> after four years, you’ve got a brand-new reboot of the network’s long-standing pop culture talk show. <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-soup-resurrected-e-jade-catta-preta-host-1202782564/">According to Deadline</a>, E! announced the return of the series during Sunday night’s People’s Choice Awards with a new host, actress and comedian Jade Catta-Preta.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/joel-mchale/">Joel McHale</a> hosted the last iteration of <i>The Soup</i>, which ran from July 2004 to December 2015, but the show was itself a reboot of E!’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/talk-soup/"><i>Talk Soup</i></a>, which launched the career of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/greg-kinnear/">Greg Kinnear</a> in 1991 and subsequently featured the hosting skills of John Henson, Hal Sparks and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/aisha-tyler/">Aisha Tyler</a> prior to its reworking.</p>
      <p>Catta-Peta has appeared in <i>Future Man</i>, <i>Californication</i>, <i>Modern Family</i> and <i>The Jim Gaffigan Show</i>, among other series, <i>and</i> was willing to get doused in gallons of soup for the show’s <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-soup-resurrected-e-jade-catta-preta-host-1202782564/"><i>Flashdance</i>-themed promo</a>, which, again, would have killed her instantly if the soup was from 1991. That’s dedication. The new <i>Soup </i>reportedly arrives at the table sometime in early 2020.</p>
