      <h1>Liverpool trying to complete West Brom transfer as Slaven Bilic training ploy pays off</h1>
      <h2>Latest West Brom news and views from BirminghamLive</h2>

      <h3>Youngster wanted</h3>
      <p>A host of Premier League sides are keeping tabs on West Bromwich Albion youngster Rico Richards, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Richards, who turned 16 in September, is being watched by Liverpool and Manchester City, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10313494/arsenal-spurs-man-city-liverpool-tracking-west-brom-wonderkid-rico-richards/">The Sun reports.</a></p>
      <p>North London rivals Arsenal and Tottenham are also said to be monitoring his progress.</p>
      <p>Richards, a number 10 or winger with an eye for goal, has been training with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Albion’s</a> under-23s but is set to be out of contract next year.</p>
      <p>The Baggies are understandably keen to tie him down to a longer contract after seeing two of their other young stars snatched away by other clubs recently.</p>

      <h3>From the training ground</h3>
      <p>Slaven Bilic was particularly delighted to see Jake Livermore’s barnstorming strike fly into Hull City’s net as West Brom stayed top over the weekend, because it was a routine that Albion had been practising in training.</p>
      <p>Livermore, back at the home of the club where he was playing before <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">the Baggies</a> snapped him up in January 2017, collected a pass from Matheus Pereira after a short corner from Matt Phillips just before the half hour mark at the KCOM Stadium, and - after taking a touch to compose himself - <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/west-brom-slaven-bilic-livermore-17229354">unleashed a shot from the best part of 25 yards that Tigers keeper George Long was without a chance in stopping.</a></p>
      <p>Bilic labelled the effort ‘magnificent’, but it wasn’t merely a case of Livermore trying his luck from distance; Albion had repeated the routine meticulously 24 hours earlier in order to expose a Hull flaw.</p>

      <h3>Finding a rhythm</h3>
      <p>This was Albion’s fourth clean sheet of the season. All of them have come away from home, and all of them have come in the last six weeks.</p>
      <p>Bilic couldn’t really explain it when asked recently. Why have there been so many leakages at The Hawthorns, but away from home it’s been largely secure?</p>
      <p>Whatever the reason, they seem to have found a rhythm on the road recently. They’ve won four of their last five games - that solitary Leeds defeat aside - on opposing patches. Of course, if you achieve yourself a shut-out, you’re only going to need one goal to win any given match.</p>
      <p>It’s not always free flowing stuff, either, but that can’t be expected for 90 minutes over 46 matches; Albion battled here, used up a few lives when Hull passed up great chances, and got themselves over the line.</p>

      <h3>Promotion predicted</h3>
      <p>West Brom will be a Premier League club again in six months' time.</p>
      <p>That is according to the latest prediction from Five Thirty Eight - the brainchild of world famous statistician Nate Silver.</p>
      <p>Silver was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world after correctly predicting the outcomes of the 2008 and 2012 US elections - but his background is actually in sports stats.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old rose to fame for developing a system for forecasting performances and career development of Major League Baseball stars before he launched the blog Five Thirty Eight in 2008, using it to correctly call the subsequent two US elections.</p>
      <p>His website has now produced a Championship model and, after the latest round of games, they have predicted how the table will finish.</p>
      <p>Albion are being tipped to win promotion by finishing second behind Leeds United.</p>

      <h3>Sticking together</h3>
      <p>Albion's Darnell Furlong has praised his teammates' ability to "stick together" to grind out a result.</p>
      <p>Hull had won three straight games heading into the clash, but Bilic's men got the job done, standing firm to keep their place at the top of the Championship table.</p>
      <p>And it's that ability to grind out a result which has impressed defender Furlong.</p>
      <p>“We set out to do that, to win the game,” <a href="https://www.wba.co.uk/news/2019/november/furlong-we-got-what-we-came-for/">he told the club's official website</a> . “To do that with a clean sheet as well, that’s all we needed to do, so I’m very pleased.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you come away from home and you get dragged into how other teams want to play. We came out on top, and we took our chance when we needed to.</p>
      <p>“It’s a good result.</p>
      <p>“The boys are sticking together and riding it out. No-one gets too ahead of themselves after or during the game. It’s a nice result to take into the international break."</p>
