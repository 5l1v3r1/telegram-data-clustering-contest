      <p>BERLIN: Borussia Moenchengladbach maintained their four-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga on Sunday (Nov 10) as Patrick Herrmann scored twice in an emphatic 3-1 home win over Werder Bremen.</p>
      <p>RB Leipzig, who won at Hertha Berlin, and defending champions Bayern Munich, who routed Dortmund 4-0 at the Allianz Arena, had both trimmed Gladbach's lead to just a point with their victories on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Gladbach finished with 10 men after goalscorer Ramy Bensebaini was sent off late on for a second yellow card before Bremen midfielder Leonardo Bittencourt netted a late goal deep into added time.</p>
      <p>It was a weekend to remember for Herrmann, whose wife gave birth to their first child on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Before the match, I hadn't noticed that the birth had given me a big boost," said Herrmann.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to pick them up from the hospital afterwards."</p>
      <p>Hosts Gladbach took the lead with two goals inside 107 seconds.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Laszlo Benes whipped in a free-kick and left-back Bensebaini out-jumped the Bremen defence to power home his header on 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The second followed almost immediately from a counter-attack, when French striker Marcus Thuram drew Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka to present Herrmann with a simple tap-in.</p>
      <p>Yuya Osako looked to have halved the lead with 28 minutes gone when Bremen's Japan forward hit the net, the goal was disallowed by VAR for a foul in the build-up.</p>
      <p>At the start of the second half, home captain Yann Sommer saved a penalty attempt by Bremen skipper Davy Klaassen on 54 minutes.</p>
      <p>Herrmann made it 3-0 by firing home on the hour mark.</p>
      <p>With time almost up, Bensebaini picked up a second yellow card for fouling Bittencourt, having also been booked while giving away the penalty Klaassen failed to convert.</p>
      <p>Gladbach will have been top for a month by the time they play their next game at newly-promoted Union Berlin in two weeks' time.</p>

        <b>FREIBURG GO FOURTH</b>
      </p>
      <p>Later on Sunday, Freiburg went fourth -Â level on points with Leipzig and Bayern - after a 1-0 home win over nine-man Eintracht Frankfurt, with three red cards dished out at the Schwarzwald Stadion.</p>
      <p>Freiburg striker Nils Petersen scored the hosts' winner 13 minutes from time, but Frankfurt played the second half with 10 men after defender Gelson Fernandes was shown a second yellow card just before half-time.</p>
      <p>There were ugly scenes at the end of a tense match as Frankfurt captain David Abraham was shown a straight red for barging into and knocking over Freiburg coach Christian Streich on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Freiburg winger Vincenzo Grifo, who had been substituted on 57 minutes, also saw a red card on the bench for grabbing Abraham by the throat in the ensuing melee.</p>
      <p>Earlier, mid-table Bayer Leverkusen backed up their mid-week Champions League win over Atletico Madrid with a 2-0 victory at Wolfsburg with goals by Karim Bellarabi and substitute Paulinho.</p>
      <p>Having been second in the table in mid-October, Wolfsburg are now 10th after four straight defeats in all competitions.</p>
      <p>Bellarabi put Leverkusen ahead on 25 minutes by powering into the area and firing home, before Brazilian midfielder Paulinho came on to add a second goal six minutes into added time.</p>
