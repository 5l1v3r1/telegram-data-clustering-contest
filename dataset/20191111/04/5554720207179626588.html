      <p><i>Bigg Boss </i>reality show left its host Salman Khan in a fix on Sunday night after a contestant told him that she considered herself as<a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/after-complaining-about-praise-for-daughter-in-law-aishwaryas-eyes-on-kbc-amitabh-bachchan-left-stunned-by-revelation-on-wife-jaya-bachchans-educational-qualification/270566/"> Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.</a> The comment by Himanshi Khurana left Salman, who reportedly dated Aishwarya until the couple’s break-up, speechless.</p>

      <p>During the <i>Weekened Ka Vaar </i>episode on Sunday night, Salman asked Himanshi if she too, felt that she resembled a Bollywood actress. This was in reference to Himanshi’s bete noire in the house, Shehnaaz Gill, often referring to herself as the Katrina Kaif of Punjab. Himanshi told Salman that she considered herself as the Aishwarya Rai. This left Salman speechless for a few seconds as he struggled to come up with a proper response.</p>
      <p>Unable to respond to Himanshi’s Aishwarya Rai’s comparison, Salman changed the topic and told both Shehnaaz and Himanshi that mere facial resemblance wasn’t enough for them to consider Katrina and Aishwarya respectively. Both, according to Salman, also needed to lose weight to achieve the fitness of these two famous Bollywood divas. Salman, of course, did not name Aishwarya while commenting on her.</p>
      <p>Aishwarya Rai had recently<a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/after-daughter-in-law-aishwarya-rai-ranbir-kapoor-and-alia-bhatt-sara-ali-khan-and-akshay-kumar-get-kbc-host-amitabh-bachchans-attention/270777/"> featured in the Sony TV’s </a><i><a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/entertainment/after-daughter-in-law-aishwarya-rai-ranbir-kapoor-and-alia-bhatt-sara-ali-khan-and-akshay-kumar-get-kbc-host-amitabh-bachchans-attention/270777/">Kaun Banega Crorepati</a> </i>show after a comment by a contestant praising her eyes evoked an interesting reaction from her father-in-law Amitabh Bachchan.</p>

      <p>As for the <i>Bigg Boss </i>show, Salman introduced new contestant Vishal Singh on the show. He was seen in the latest season of <i>Nach Baliye</i>, which was also produced by Salman. Both Salman and Vishal played a game of confessions, which the former felt was designed to embarrass him. As part of the game, Salman confessed to having dated a woman older than him. He also answered in the affirmative to a question on whether he will get married in the next five years.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the show, actors Sidharth Malhotra and Riteish Deshmukh entered the house to promote their upcoming film <i>Marjaavan. </i></p>
