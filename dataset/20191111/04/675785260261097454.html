      <h1>Man Utd 'target Zlatan Ibrahimovic reunion' in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>United are set to rival AC Milan for their former striker's services according to latest reports from Italy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:09:08+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:09</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United are reportedly set to rival AC Milan for Zlatan Ibrahimovic's signature when the January transfer window opens.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> are expected to target a centre-forward in the new year after struggling for goals this season - albeit they put three past <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday in what manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer described as their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-lauds-man-20855318">best performance of the season</a> .</p>
      <p>Out-of-favour <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> striker Mario Mandzukic has been widely tipped as United's most likely option.</p>
      <p>But the Red Devils have also been linked with a return for their former striker Ibrahimovic, who is a free agent after his spell with MLS club LA Galaxy ended.</p>
      <p>MLS commissioner Don Graber has claimed Ibrahimovic is already <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/mls-chief-claims-zlatan-ibrahimovich-20836899">on his way to another former club, AC Milan</a> .</p>

      <p>But Italian outlet <a href="https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/">TuttoMercatoWeb</a> claim United are ready to battle Milan for the services of the 38-year-old Swede.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/zlatan-ibrahimovic">Ibrahimovic</a> left United for LA Galaxy in 2018 and has scored 29 goals in two seasons for the MLS side.</p>
      <p>He has been linked with a host of clubs as he aims to extend his playing career - and Graber has claimed AC Milan will be his next destination.</p>

      <p>Graber told ESPN: "Zlatan is an interesting character. He keeps me very busy &amp; you need this kind of players like what happened with Beckham few years ago.</p>
      <p>"He is 38 years old &amp; has now been signed by Milan, one of the biggest clubs in the world."</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic recently teased a return to Spain, posting an <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> story claiming: "Hola Espana. I'm coming back".</p>
      <p>But it has been claimed the post was a publicity stunt related to him becoming a brand ambassador for betting firm Bethard.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic appeared to confirm his MLS career was over after LA Galaxy's play-off defeat last month.</p>
      <p>"What happens next year? I don't know," he said. "If I stay it will be good for MLS because the whole world will watch it. If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is."</p>
