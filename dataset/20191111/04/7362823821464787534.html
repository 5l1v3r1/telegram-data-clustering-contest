      <h1>Trump urges Iran to release ex-FBI agent Levinson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:05:40+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:05</time> by <a rel="author">Edmund DeMarche</a></address>
      <p>President Trump took to Twitter late Sunday to urge Iran to release <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-acknowledges-on-going-case-for-retired-fbi-agent-missing-since-2007">the retired FBI agent who had been missing</a> in the country since 2007 and said it would be a very positive step toward easing tensions between the two countries since provocations on the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
      <p>Robert Levinson’s <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/robert-levinson-reward-iran-fbi-agent-20-million-pompeo">disappearance</a> has been the source of intrigue. He vanished during an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/families-of-iran-hostages-robert-levinson-call-on-world-governments-to-step-up-and-send-our-loved-ones-home">unauthorized </a>CIA mission.  Iran acknowledged on Sunday that there is an open Revolutionary Court case involving Levinson.</p>
      <p>“If Iran is able to turn over to the U.S. kidnapped former FBI Agent Robert A. Levinson, who has been missing in Iran for 12 years, it would be a very positive step,” Trump tweeted.</p>
      <p>If Levinson is alive, he would be the longest-held prisoner in U.S. history.</p>
      <p>Last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/foreign-policy/state-department">State Department</a> would offer $20 million on top of a $5 million reward already posted for information leading to Levinson’s recovery and return.</p>

      <p>The AP revealed  in 2013 that Levinson-- at 58-- had been on a mission for CIA analysts who had no authority to run spy operations. Levinson’s family had received a $2.5 million annuity from the CIA in order to stop a lawsuit revealing details of his work, while the agency forced out three veteran analysts and disciplined seven others.</p>
