      <p>A video showing Tennessee Court of Appeals Judge Richard Dinkins swearing in newly-graduated lawyer Juliana Lamar <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911011077195479-indias-opposition-squirm-over-whatsapp-snooping-alleges-its-leaders-judges-could-be-on-radar-/">was uploaded to social media</a> and quickly went viral.</p>
      <p>In the video, the judge rocks Lamar’s 1-year old son Beckham on his hip as he reads the oath to Lamar. Between the judge’s ceremonial robes and big eyeglasses, the situation makes Dinkins look like a loving granny.</p>

      <p>​Lamar, who <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911031077210881-judge-rules-against-trumps-requirement-for-possible-immigrants-to-have-health-insurance/">just recently graduated</a> from Belmont University College of Law, said it was the judge’s idea to take the baby to the ceremony.</p>
      <blockquote>“I am so glad he did because to have my son take part in one of the greatest moments of my life was truly a blessing,” she said, according to The Hill. </blockquote>
      <p>Prior to her graduation, Lamar worked at Dinkins’s office as a clerk and she calls the judge a “a guiding light during my legal career,” adding that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910291077170247-federal-judge-allows-maga-sandmann-sue-washington-post-defamation/">Dinkins supported her</a> as she coped with studying and taking care of a newborn at the same time.</p>
      <blockquote>"The pressure I felt was horrible, and I hope it has led my law school to rethink its policies for future mothers," Lamar said.</blockquote>
