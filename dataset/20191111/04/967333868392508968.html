      <p>Haley claimed that, while senior US diplomat, she witnessed a private conversation between then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and then-White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who allegedly defended resisting US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <blockquote>"Instead of saying that to me, they should've been saying that to the president, not asking me to join them on their sidebar plan", <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nikki-haley-i-was-asked-by-cabinet-members-to-take-sides-against-the-president/">Haley told CBS</a>, adding that the two men “confided in me that when they resisted the president, they weren't being insubordinate, they were trying to save the country [...] Tillerson went on to tell me the reason he resisted the president's decisions was because, if he didn't, people would die".</blockquote>
      <p>Haley argued, however, that she was not impressed at the time with the dialogue, adding that she did not appreciate having the two senior US officials confide in her.</p>
      <blockquote>“It should've been, 'Go tell the president what your differences are, and quit if you don't like what he's doing'”, Haley told CBS, adding that "to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911091077267671-presidential-harassment-trump-unleashes-twitterstorm-ahead-of-public-impeachment-hearings/">undermine a president</a> is really a very dangerous thing. And it goes against the Constitution, and it goes against what the American people want. And it was offensive".</blockquote>
      <p>In the interview, Haley criticized the ongoing impeachment probe against Trump.</p>
      <blockquote>“You're gonna impeach a president for asking for a favor that didn't happen and giving money and it wasn't withheld? I don't know what you would impeach him on [...] The Ukrainians never did the investigation. And the president released the funds. I mean, when you look at those, there's just nothing impeachable there”, Haley said.</blockquote>
      <p>The freeze of hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine over the summer has been at the heart of the impeachment inquiry against Trump. The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911101077268515-fake-president-de-niro-says-trump-impeachment-shows-potus-has-to-be-held-accountable/">Democrats believe</a> that the president held back aid to Ukraine in a bid to pressure its leadership into opening an investigation into allegations that former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate for the White House whose son was a board member at Ukrainian gas company Burisma, engaged in corrupt acts.</p>
      <p>Trump has denied <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911091077267244-house-republicans-request-hunter-biden-testify-in-public-impeachment-hearing/">applying pressure to Ukrainian</a> leadership while he requested it to probe possible instances of corruption, which he said is his duty as US president.</p>
