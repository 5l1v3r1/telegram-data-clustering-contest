      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:47:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:47</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Meghan Markle did take baby Archie to New York to watch Serena Williams compete in the US Open, the tennis star has revealed.</p>
      <p>The Duchess of Sussex flew across the Atlantic for the final of the tournament in September, when Archie was four-months-old.</p>
      <p>It was widely assumed that Meghan left Archie with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> when she flew out to the US Open.</p>
      <p>Meghan has been close pals with Serena, who described the royal as 'the strongest person I know', since they met at a Super Bowl party in 2010.</p>
      <p>Mrs Williams said Meghan flew back to the UK straight after watching her lose to Bianca Andreescu in the final.</p>

      <p>She told Access Hollywood: "She flew all the way with a newborn to see me play in New York and flew all the way back that night, and I probably couldn't have done that.</p>
      <p>"I think it's really cool to have a group of friends who are doing amazing things and face the same pressures you face with being in the public eye."</p>
      <p>Mrs Williams praised Meghan over how she has dealt with the intense scrutiny that comes with being a member of the royal family.</p>

      <p>She added: "I'm not sure that many people can relate on that level, I don't think I can. I just think she's the strongest person I know, the nicest, sweetest..."</p>
      <p>The tennis star said the Duchess does 'many' things for her - and is always there for a chat if she is feeling low.</p>
      <p>Meghan flew to New York on a commercial flight after she and Harry were criticised for their use of private jets, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7669767/Serena-Williams-reveals-Archie-travelled-Meghan-watch-play-open.html">Mail Online</a> reports.</p>
