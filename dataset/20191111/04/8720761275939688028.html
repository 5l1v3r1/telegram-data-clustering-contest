      <p>Twitter is proposing a handful of new features <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/11/twitter-proposes-flagging-deepfakes-but-would-only-remove-content-that-threatens-harm/">designed to help its users spot "synthetic" or "manipulated" media</a>, including deepfake videos. From a report:<i> The social networking giant last month announced plans to implement a new policy around media assets that have been altered to mislead the public. Today heralds Twitter's first draft proposal, alongside a public consultation period, as it works to refine the rules and how they will be enforced. "When you come to Twitter to see what's happening in the world, we want you to have context about the content you're seeing and engaging with," said Twitter VP of trust and safety Del Harvey in a blog post. "Deliberate attempts to mislead or confuse people through manipulated media undermine the integrity of the conversation."</i></p>
