      <h1>Wee battler inspires donors as £150k raised for NHS neonatal unit</h1>
      <h2>Finlay Thorburn was born 15 weeks premature and his parents have since helped raise cash for Glasgow Children’s Hospital Charity.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T04:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Dingwall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/john-dingwall/</a></address>
      <p>The family of a baby boy who was born 15 weeks early have raised thousands of pounds for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">hospital</a> unit where he spent the first 101 days of his life.</p>
      <p>Finlay Thorburn’s parents donated £23,500 to the Glasgow Children’s Hospital <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/charity">Charity</a> and his mum Morna was guest speaker at the charity’s annual fundraising ball on Friday, where another £130,000 was raised.</p>
      <p>Her son was born in the neonatal unit at the Princess Royal in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> last year at just 25 weeks gestation and fought for strength under its care until he was well enough to go home with his mum, dad Craig and big sister Emily, four.</p>
      <p>Morna and Craig, from Mugdock, near Glasgow, raised the money earlier this year to purchase two transport incubators for the unit.</p>
      <p>She said: “The doctors, specialist nurses and consultants all played a pivotal part in looking after Finlay and this amazing team quickly became a big part of our lives.</p>

      <p>“However, to accomplish their jobs to the full, they need access to the best equipment.</p>
      <p>“I had a traumatic labour and Finlay was whisked away from us very quickly.</p>
      <p>“I held him for a second and then he was ventilated and moved to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).</p>
      <p>“It was day eight before we had skin-to-skin contact. Holding him, with so many tubes and leads, added to the realisation of how fragile he was.</p>
      <p>“We know only too well that Finlay should not be here, however he is.</p>
      <p>“Staff from the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, Royal Hospital for Children and Royal Alexandra Hospital are worth their weight in gold but without them, and the support of Glasgow Children’s Hospital Charity, it would all be impossible.</p>
      <p>“We’re proud to support this important cause, to help give babies like our son Finlay the best start in life.”</p>
      <p>The charity’s 13th annual fundraiser took place at the Hilton Glasgow to kickstart their appeal which will enable the charity to purchase life-saving equipment for neonatal units, including more than £50,000 to fund state-of-the-art LifeStart resuscitation trolleys.</p>

      <p>The appeal is aiming to raise £250,000 for the neonatal units at the three hospitals where almost 2000 babies are cared for each year.</p>
      <p>After helping launch the appeal, Dr Neil Patel, consultant neonatologist at Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Children, said: “For babies in our care, the neonatal unit is the only home they know for weeks or months.</p>
      <p>“They may be born prematurely or severely unwell, needing life support from birth and sometimes major surgery in the first few days of life.</p>
      <p>“What makes all of these babies extraordinary is a resilience and a will to live, which helps them to thrive despite the challenges that life has dealt them at the earliest time.</p>
      <p>“The charity’s Neonatal Appeal will ensure we have the best possible tools to care for the sickest babies. The money will fund the latest technology, most advanced incubators and the best life-support machines to help more babies survive to lead long, happy and fulfilled lives.”</p>
      <p>Babies treated at neonatal units have the best chance of survival.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the <i><b>Daily Record</b></i> teamed up with the charity to help their Gift of Hope Christmas appeal raise more than £500,000.</p>
