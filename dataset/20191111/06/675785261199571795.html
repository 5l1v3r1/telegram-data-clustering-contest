      <h1>Jennifer Aniston calls Friends 'the gift of a lifetime' as honoured as icon</h1>
      <h2>Jen was accepting her Icon Award at the People's Choice Award ceremony when she thanked the 'fantastic show and fantastic cast' for exploding her career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:04:12+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:04</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jennifer-aniston">Jennifer Aniston</a> has gushed over hit sitcom Friends and credited it as being just the thing she needed to launch her acting career.</p>
      <p>Jen, 50, starred in all ten seasons of the wildly popular comedy, portraying spoiled rich girl turned fashion titan Rachel Green.</p>
      <p>Now, she's been honoured at the People's Choice Awards with the Icon Award, presented to her by close friend and frequent collaborator Adam Sandler.</p>
      <p>Introducing his pal, Adam said: "I truly love this girl and love making movies with her and hope we can do a lot more."</p>
      <p>Stunning in a black dress, Jen took to the stage, hugged Adam and spoke to the star-studded crowd holding her award.</p>

      <p>"This town puts out a lot of awards," she said, "But People's Choice has always been special to me.</p>
      <p>"As actors, we don't do this for the critics or for each other or to make our families proud...we do this for the money! I'm kidding, we do it for you guys, we really do.</p>
      <p>"If I have a claim to this word 'icon', it was only because I was able to be on an iconic show with an iconic cast and an iconic haircut.</p>

      <p>"I mean, Friends was truly the gift of a lifetime and I would not be standing up here without that fantastic show and that fantastic cast. It's paved the way for everything I've had the chance to do since."</p>
      <p>She's also gearing up for the launch of her new comedy-drama The Morning Show, in which she stars as a journalist in a sexist newsroom, alongside close friend Reese Witherspoon.</p>
      <p>Last month, Jen shattered fans' minds when she not only joined <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , but marked the occasion with a selfie of the Friends cast - Jen was joined by Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, Matt Le Blanc and Matthew Perry.</p>
