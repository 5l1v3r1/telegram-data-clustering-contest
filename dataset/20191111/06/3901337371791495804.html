      <h1>Where Are Kaizer Chiefs Getting It Right? Reader’s Voice</h1>

      <p>Kaizer Chiefs aren’t playing the prettiest football in the league but with results on their side, the Khosination are taking good results over good football any day.</p>
      <p>Ernst Middendorp has managed to win over the hard to impress Chiefs supporters. Though it is still early to start talking championships but it will never be too early to collect maximum points.</p>
      <p>After beating Orlando Pirates over the weekend, Chiefs is sitting pretty at the top, 10 points clear at the summit of the Absa Premiership standings. The one thing Chiefs are doing right is grinding out results and leaving the talking to the football pundits.</p>
      <p>The Soweto derby is revived and got back the swag. FNB Stadium was filled to the brim, spectators who came in their huge numbers were entertained to a five goal thriller, something the fans were longing for in the derby. Although Pirates was the better side and created more scoring opportunities than Chiefs, Amakhosi were once again on the winning side.</p>
      <p>Chiefs are two games shy of Telkom Knockout title and in the driving seat of the league title race.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can they do it?</b>
