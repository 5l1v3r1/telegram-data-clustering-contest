      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After a major decline, bitcoin found support near the $8,670 level against the US Dollar. A new monthly low was formed near $8,674 before the price started an upside correction.</p>
      <p>The price recovered above the $8,800 and $8,900 levels. Moreover, there was a break above the $9,000 resistance area and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The bulls were able to gain strength, but they faced a strong selling interest near the $9,150 and $9,160 levels.</p>
      <p>A high was formed near $9,146 and the price is currently retreating from the high. It broke the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/08/bitcoin-btc-price-showing-signs-of-bearish-continuation/">$9,000 support area</a> and the 100 hourly SMA. Additionally, there was a break below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $8,674 low to $9,146 high.</p>
      <p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $8,900 level. It represents the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $8,674 low to $9,146 high. The main support is near the $8,860 and $8,840 levels.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $8,840 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Finally, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $8,674 low to $9,146 high is near $8,854.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a downside break below the $8,840 level might restart the decline in bitcoin. The next key support is near the $8,700 area, below which the price could revisit the $8,500 level.</p>
      <p>On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near the $9,100 and $9,150 levels. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $9,100 on the same chart.</p>
