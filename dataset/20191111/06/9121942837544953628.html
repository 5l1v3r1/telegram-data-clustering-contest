      <p>ISLAMABAD (AP) — The party of Pakistan’s ailing ex-prime minister is upset that he’s still on a no-fly list, blocking him from getting medical treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>Nawaz Sharif was released on bail last month after his jail sentence was temporarily suspended on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>Sharif, 69, received a seven-year jail sentence for corruption and money laundering in 2018, but his health has recently deteriorated.</p>
      <p>Maryam Aurangzeb, the spokeswoman for Sharif’s opposition political party, said Monday that he’s still waiting for a travel ban to be lifted.</p>
      <p>She says a medical board comprising of Sharif’s physician and government doctors has recommended country’s former premier be sent abroad.</p>
      <p>Sharif was removed from office by the judiciary in 2017 over corruption allegations.</p>
