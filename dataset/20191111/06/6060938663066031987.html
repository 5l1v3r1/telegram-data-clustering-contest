      <p>Bollywood actress <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>, who had all of B-town buzzing after she was nominated for the E! People's Choice Awards 2019, in 'The <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Most-Inspiring-Asian-Woman-of-2019">Most Inspiring Asian Woman of 2019</a>' category, along with seven other nominees. Sadly, she lost out to South Korean singer-songwriter <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/CL">CL</a>.</p>
      <p>The actress was the only Indian to feature on the list, that included fellow Asian stars Zhou Dongyu, South Korean actor Jung Yu-mi, Thai actor Praya Lundberg, Indonesian actor Raline Shah, Malaysian singer-songwriter Yuna and also Thai model Chutimon Chuengcharoensukying.</p>
      <p>The nominees come from all over Asia- from India to South Korea. These personalities were picked for the popularity of their work in film, music and television and most importantly for their impactful work in society and world at large.</p>
      <p>Alia was recognized for her accomplishment as a Bollywood actress and singer and recognized for the complex characters she brought to life on the big screen. Besides her impressive accolades as an actress, her campaigns for the welfare of street animals through her initiative and her contribution to raising awareness for various environmental causes earned her a spot in the nominations.</p>
      <p>Sadly, she lost out to CL, who is dubbed as "The Baddest Female" on earth, for her rule-breaking music and serving as an inspiration to women to love themselves and break beauty norms.</p>
