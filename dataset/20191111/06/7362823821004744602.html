      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/donald-trump-jr-robert-mueller-witch-hunt">Donald Trump Jr.</a>, who is on a nationwide book tour that included a tense stop last week at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/donald-trump-jr-on-clash-with-the-view-i-dont-think-they-like-me-much-anymore">“The View,"</a> visited Sunday the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was received by both protesters and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/donald-trump-democrats-dad-office-punish-supporters">some supporters.</a></p>
      <p>Trump Jr.'s appearance was marked by an argument between him and the audience over why he would not take questions, The Guardian newspaper reported. Trump was greeted with shouts of "USA! USA!" when he first appeared on the stage of a lecture hall, but members of the audience eventually turned to louder, openly hostile chants of "Q and A! Q and A!" after they were told he would not take questions, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>The Guardian said that Trump Jr. told the audience that taking questions from the floor risked creating soundbites that left-wing social media posters would abuse and distort.</p>
      <p>Kimberly Guilfoyle, his girlfriend, told audience members that they were being rude, according to The Guardian.</p>
      <p>After the stop at the university, Trump Jr. posted on Twitter that he appeared at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, where he reportedly stayed for over four hours and had about 1,400 in attendance. He said the audience had high energy.</p>
