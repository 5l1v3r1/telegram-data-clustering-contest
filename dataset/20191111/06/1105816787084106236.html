      <h1>Instagram to hide your likes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:26:26+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/6748/tech-desk/" target="_blank">Tech Desk</a></address>
      <p>Instagram is working on hiding the number of likes each post receives, this till date is one of the most controversial and crucial experiments conducted by the company.</p>
      <p>The social media giant will roll out the experiment in the US starting next week; users of the social media app will find their likes disappeared overnight.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made by Instagram Chief Adam Mosseri at the WIRED25 conference.</p>

      <p>The idea behind the experiment is to create a friendlier and safer environment for the younger generation.</p>
      <p>“It’s about young people,” Mosseri said.</p>
      <p>“The idea is to try and depressurise Instagram, make it less of a competition, give people more space to focus on connecting with people that they love, things that inspire them.”</p>
      <p>The number of likes will be visible only to the account owners and not the followers in a separate section of the app.</p>
      <p>“We have to see the effects it has on how people feel about the platform, how it affects how they use the platform, how it affects the creator ecosystem,” Mosseri said.</p>
      <p>So far, the experiment has not been well received amongst users especially influencers who believe that the change will harm their ability to monetise their posts.</p>
      <p>It isn’t clear whether this would be a permanent change or not.</p>
