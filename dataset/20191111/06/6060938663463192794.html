      <h1>Safeguarding your child against air pollution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Air pollution is a public health hazard and has become a major contributing factor for several respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. It has become the primary trigger for causing breathing ailments in both adults and children. The recent toxic haze surrounding Delhi NCR and several other parts of North India and the resultant level of air quality index has led to people, especially children falling severely sick. Recent data from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), reported the Air Quality Index at an alarming level of over 600 in most of North India as opposed to the acceptable level of 200.</p>
      <p>Children are more susceptible to air pollution because they have a higher breathing rate as compared to adults. While an adult takes between 12 and 18 breaths a minute, a 3-year old takes 20 to 30 breaths a minute and a newborn takes 30 to 40. Therefore, young children breathe in the polluted air two to three times more as compared to adults. Children also have more exposure to air pollution as they spend more time outdoor engaging in recreational activities. All this makes it important for parents to be aware of the harmful effects of air pollution and ways to safeguard their children against it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Risks associated with pollution in children</b>
      </p>
      <p>The vital organs in our body including the lungs develop during childhood, making children particularly vulnerable to short-term illnesses such as asthma and life-long illnesses such as reduction of lung volume. Pollution also has an adverse effect on neurodevelopment and cognitive ability. Apart from these, children who have been exposed to high levels of air pollution may be at greater risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease later in life. Pollution can also raise risk of childhood cancer.</p>
      <p><b>Warning signs of acute effects of air pollution<br/></b>-Irritation of the eyes, nose and throat</p>
      <p>-Coughing</p>
      <p>-Chest tightness</p>
      <p>-Shortness of breath</p>
      <p>-Preventive measures</p>
      <p>-Avoid smoking</p>
      <p>-Avoid indoor pollutants such as particulates from candles and incense, strong perfumes etc.</p>
      <p>-Gases and particles are released while cooking, which can reach harmful levels if not properly ventilated. Therefore, ensure the kitchen is properly ventilated while cooking.</p>
      <p>-Remove carpets at home as they attract dust and are difficult to clean</p>
      <p>-Wet mopping is preferred as opposed to dry dusting and vacuuming</p>
      <p>-Keep trash covered to avoid pests and insect</p>
      <p>-Avoid painting your house as paints contain toxic chemicals like formaldehyde</p>
      <p>-Use air purifiers at home especially while sleeping at night and in the car while travelling</p>
      <p>-Consume a healthy diet, rich in anti-oxidants to fight the oxidative stress of air pollution</p>
      <p>-Avoid engaging in physical activities and outdoor games early in the morning or evening as pollution levels are at peak during these hours</p>
      <p>
        <b>Effective management</b>
      </p>
      <p>The solution to combating air pollution lies in finding a permanent and sustainable solution. Apart from the above preventive measures, one should consider using public transport, car pool or walk. High-risk patients can use a N-95 mask worn around the nose and mouth. Air purifiers are most effective if the room is properly sealed and the person remains in that room for most of the day. Adding hypoallergenic plants in your house such as peace lilies, spathiphyllum, jainet craig, bamboo palms and dracaena fragans can also help in purifying the air.</p>
