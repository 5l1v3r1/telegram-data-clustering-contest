      <h1>Samsung Teases Imminent Galaxy Fold Launch in Kenya</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T06:28:53+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author">Kiruti Itimu</a></address>
      <p>Samsung has had their fair share of controversial phones in the past, but in 2019, the <b><a href="https://techweez.com/2019/02/22/samsung-galaxy-fold-is-a-good-first-gen-product-that-you-should-skip/">Galaxy Fold</a> </b>took the cake. It was their first attempt at the next major smartphone form-factor and it was riddled with issues. <a href="https://techweez.com/2019/04/17/samsung-galaxy-fold-display-issues/">The issues were so grand</a> to the point where they retracted their initial launch for a September launch to fix them.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Fold is an expensive smartphone, Samsung quoted a $1,980 (Kshs  202,890) price tag when it launched. I did not expect this to launch in the Kenyan market (due to the insane price) but I guess I was wrong.</p>
      <p>Samsung Kenya recently teased on Twitter of an ‘engineering marvel’ that we should await.</p>

      <p>From the video, this is clearly a Galaxy Fold, the <i>unfolding the future</i> tagis a dead giveaway. The interesting bit is that this launch is set on the 14th of November. That is Thursday this week.</p>
      <p>It is kind of surprising that Samsung would launch the Galaxy Fold in Kenya. This is clearly an enthusiast phone and with its high price tag, it is clearly targeted for a small group of people who want to sample the bleeding edge of tech. The premise of having a phone and a tablet in one formfactor could be alluring to some.</p>
      <p>However, you can also argue that Samsung is doing this to make a name for itself in this market. They will be the only manufacturer to launch a folding phone of its calibre in this market, which will make it stand out from the crowd.</p>
