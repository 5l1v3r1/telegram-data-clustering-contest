      <p>KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) - Like snowbirds, there's another group that's moving the Florida for the winter: sharks.</p>
      <p>Shark experts say the coast of Florida is starting to heat up with white shark activity. <a href="https://www.ocearch.org/tracker/?list">OCSEARCH</a> , a research group, says the annual migration to warmer waters off the Florida and Carolinas coasts is underway.</p>
      <p>The Palm Beach Post reports that eight white sharks tagged by the Utah-based research group were spotted from New Jersey to Florida in the last week.</p>
      <p>Three other sharks that had been tagged were detected Wednesday in waters on North Carolina beaches, and two more sharks -Helena and the 2,076-pound Unama'ki -made their presence known with toothy grins just west of Key West in September.</p>
      <p>Unama'ki had been tagged off Nova Scotia in September. She's a big girl -some 15-feet, 5-inches.</p>
      <p>It's not unusual for great whites to call southern waters home during winter and sightings are common near popular fishing and diving spots in Florida through spring.</p>
