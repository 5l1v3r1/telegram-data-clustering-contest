      <p>FLATLANDS, Brooklyn (WABC) -- Police are investigating after two were killed, and one was injured in a murder-suicide in Brooklyn Sunday afternoon.</p>
      <p>A 911 call was received at about 2 p.m. for a shooting on Utica Avenue in the Flatlands section. Police say 24-year-old Jened Duncan and 30-year-old Darnell Solomon were both found shot in the head. A 33-year-old man was found with a bullet wound in his torso.</p>
      <p>Police are not looking for a shooter, and stress that no gunman is on the loose.</p>
      <p>A woman who spoke to Eyewitness News says her family member, Solomon was one of the two people who died.</p>
      <p>While the details are too much for her to understand, Eyewitness News has learned that Solomon, armed with a gun arrived at his ex-girlfriend's apartment shooting his ex, Duncan in the head, and Duncan's current boyfriend in the torso. He then turned the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>"I came outside and I see all this commotion, a vehicle there with bullets, and then I saw the police cutting off the area - it's disturbing to see all this," says Greg, who lives in the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Duncan and Solomon were both pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital. Police say the 33-year-old man shot in the torso is recovering at Brookdale Hospital.</p>
