      <p>On November 11 KST, the day of the originally scheduled debriefing, the <b>Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency</b> announced that it would be moved to the next day on November 12.</p>
      <p>During the press debriefing, the police plan to disclose more information from their investigation, which began following the finale of '<b>Produce X 101</b>' this past July.</p>
