      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT The Popeyes customer in Tennessee, US, has received treatment for nine fractures in her elbow, six broken ribs and a broken left leg</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:35:31+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:35</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>Disturbing footage shows a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/takeaways">takeaway</a> worker hurl a customer to the ground for complaining she’d been charged twice for a chicken burger.</p>
      <p>Deriance Ra'Shaiel Hughes has been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crime">arrested</a> after allegedly charging into Debra Staggs outside the Popeyes chain in Columbia, Tennessee.</p>
      <p>It's believed Ms Staggs, 55, has since received treatment for nine fractures in her elbow, six broken ribs and a broken left leg.</p>
      <p>She had complained she had been overcharged for her burger, it is understood.</p>
      <p>But the clip captures a heated exchange in the restaurant, during which Hughes appears to lose his cool.</p>
      <p>Colleagues rush to try to calm the 29-year-old down.</p>
      <p>However, the footage cuts to an altercation outside the diner in which Ms Staggs is seen bodyslammed to the floor.</p>

      <p>Rocky McElhaney, the woman's lawyer, said she has already had two operations and faces months of rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>He alleges the fracas erupted after Ms Staggs paid $13.11 (£10.25) for a meal of apple pies, corn, biscuits and chicken.</p>

      <p>It's said she returned to the restaurant for a refund after realising at home she’d been double-charged.</p>
      <p>Hughes has been charged with aggravated assault.</p>
      <p>A Popeyes spokesperson said the company was "shocked" over the attack.</p>

      <p>"These actions run completely contrary to our standards and the integrity of our brand.</p>
      <p>"Following an investigation, the franchisee took immediate action and we were informed that the employee has since been terminated.</p>
      <p>"The entire circumstance is highly unfortunate for all involved, and we hope to never see this type of behaviour again."</p>
