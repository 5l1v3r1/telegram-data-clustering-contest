      <p>UDON THANI (Reuters) - In a remote Catholic school in Thailand, Sister Ana Rosa Sivori, 77, kneels in a chapel to pray at the beginning of the school day.</p>

      <p>The Catholic nun is also counting down the days when she will be reunited with her cousin, Pope Francis.</p>
      <p>Or, as she calls him, Jorge. They grew up together in Argentina.</p>
      <p>Sister Sivori, who has lived in Thailand for more than 50 years, will travel with Pope Francis when he visits from Nov. 20 to 23.</p>
      <p>“For me, it’s a pleasure that he’s coming ... I never thought that he will be coming to Thailand,” the soft-spoken nun told Reuters in an interview.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy for the people. I want the people to see him, to be close to him.”</p>
      <p>The cousins, whose grandfathers were brothers, grew up in a big Catholic family in Argentina.</p>
      <p>Sivori said they weren’t close as children, since Jorge Mario Bergoglio - as the Pope was known then - was six years older than she.</p>
      <p>She joined the Catholic ministry young, and her calling as a missionary brought her to Thailand, where she has lived since 1966 and worked in schools across the country.</p>
      <p>Now, she is a vice principal at St. Mary’s School in the northeastern province of Udon Thani, about 600 km (370 miles) from Bangkok, the capital.</p>
      <p>The cousins have grown closer since Bergoglio became Pope Francis in 2013.</p>
      <p>On every journey home to her family in Argentina, Sivori first stops by the Vatican in Italy to see him for a few days.</p>
      <p>The last time they saw each other was in 2018, when they bonded over their love of books.</p>
      <p>“He took me up to the big room with plenty of books. He told me to choose, he would ask ‘Do you want this one?’,” she said.</p>
      <p>“When we talk, we feel like brother and sister. For me, of course I know that he’s the Pope ... but we talk simply.”</p>
      <p>She will travel to Bangkok ahead of the pontiff’s arrival and shadow him during his visit, at his request.</p>
      <p>In the Buddhist-majority country, Pope Francis will meet King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the supreme Buddhist patriarch, Catholic leaders and students, before flying on to Japan.</p>

      <p>Sivori brings out an envelope of handwritten letters and postcards from the Vatican and reads them fondly.</p>
      <p>“When I meet him, I’ll call him by his name, Jorge. Pope Francis just came after,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of him.”</p>
