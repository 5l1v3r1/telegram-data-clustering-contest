      <h1>Ayodhya Verdict: 77 Arrested In Uttar Pradesh For Posting 'Inflammatory' Content Online</h1>
      <h2>At least seven men were arrested for setting off firecrackers or creating disturbances while distributing sweets in celebration.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:51:29+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:51</time> by <a rel="author">Abhirup Roy</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of people in India have been <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/india-religion-temple/india-detains-users-over-inflammatory-online-posts-after-religious-site-ruling-idINKBN1XK04W">detained</a> on suspicion of publishing inflammatory social media posts and setting off celebratory firecrackers after the Supreme Court ruled to give the disputed Ayodhya site to Hindus, police said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/supreme-court/">Supreme Court of India</a> granted the site of the demolished <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/babri-masjid/">Babri Masjid</a> to the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/ayodhya-verdict-hindu-trust-gets-possession-of-babri-site-muslims-granted-alternative-site_in_5dc64178e4b0fcfb7f6696a8">Hindu parties</a>, while ordering that the Muslim litigants be given a 5 acre alternative site to construct a mosque.</p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>In 1992, a Hindu mob destroyed the 16th-century Babri Mosque on the site, triggering riots in which about 2,000 people, most of them Muslims, were killed. No major violence was reported after the ruling over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Authorities said they were showing a “zero tolerance approach” towards potentially inflammatory content on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook (<a href="https://in.reuters.com/companies/FB.O">FB.O</a>) and WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>About 77 people were arrested as of late Sunday in Uttar Pradesh, state police said on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Police have acted upon 8,275 social media posts across the state by either reporting them to the platform or asking users to delete them, the police said in a press note issued late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Any illegal conduct on the internet will be noticed and acted upon,” PV Rama Sastry, additional director general of police for law and order in Uttar Pradesh’s capital Lucknow, told <i>Reuters</i> earlier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The police also said they had sealed a local office of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha and detained its national Vice President Ashok Sharma. They did not provide further details.</p>
      <p>In another part of the state, at least seven men were arrested for setting off firecrackers or creating disturbances while distributing sweets in celebration.</p>
      <p>The Home Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for information on arrests.</p>
      <p>The government has deployed thousands of members of paramilitary forces and police in Ayodhya and other sensitive places.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>“DISHEARTENED”</h3>
      <p>The court’s decision paves the way for the construction of a Hindu temple on the site, a proposal long supported by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party.</p>
      <p>Hindus believe the site is the birthplace of Lord Ram, a physical incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, and say the site was holy for Hindus long before the Mughals built the Babri mosque there in 1528.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court called the 1992 demolition of the mosque illegal but handed the 2.77 acre (1.1 hectare) plot to a Hindu group.</p>
      <p>It directed that another plot in Ayodhya be provided to a Muslim group that had contested the case.</p>
      <p>Some scholars and activists saw the judgement as unfair, particularly given that the 1992 razing of the mosque was deemed illegal.</p>
      <p>“Why has the 2.77 acres been gifted to the very elements who were party to this?,” Syeda Hameed, the president of the Muslim Women’s Forum, wrote in the <i>Hindustan Times</i>, referring to the mosque’s destruction.</p>
      <p>Muslim leaders have called for peace between majority Hindus and Muslims.</p>
      <p>Some seemed to have resigned themselves to the decision.</p>
      <p>“I am disheartened with the verdict and leaving it to Allah,” said Mohammad Azam Qadri, a community leader in Ayodhya.</p>
