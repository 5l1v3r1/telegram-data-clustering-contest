      <p>CHANDIGARH: No one knew at that time, but Sachin Tendulkar’s final Ranji Trophy match became the setting of a most unlikely passing of baton. Seated on her father’s shoulders at the Bansi Lal Stadium in Lahli, Haryana, was a nine-year-old chanting the hero’s name, ‘Saaachin, Sachin!’ That was 2013. Six years later, on Saturday, life came full circle. The same girl, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shafali-Verma">Shafali Verma</a>, now 15 years and 285 days old, shattered her idol’s 30-year-old record when she became the youngest Indian to score an international fifty in the first T20I against the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/West-Indies">West Indies</a> in St Lucia.</p>
      <p>Tendulkar was 16 years and 214 days when he scored his maiden half-century (59, vs Pakistan at Faisalabad in 1989). At 15 years and 267 days, UAE’s Kavisha Egodage is the youngest woman to score an international 50, against Malayasia in Jan 2019).</p>
      <p>India win as Rohtak basks in teen Shafali’s spotlight</p>
      <p>The Rohtak teen has had an extraordinary journey. On October 3, TOI had reported how she had to be enrolled in the guise of a boy after being refused admission in the city’s <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a> academies since she was a girl. TOI had also highlighted how she made her mark in only her second outing for India, smashing 46 off just 33 balls against South Africa, last month.</p>

      <p>Such was the brilliance of Shafali’s batting on Saturday, it moved coach WV Raman to urge people to catch it on You-Tube. “Folks, make it a point to watch Shafali Verma’s innings in the first T20 on you tube.. You will not regret the time spent,” tweeted the former Indian Test opener.</p>
      <p>Shafali and seasoned opener Smriti Mandhana stitched an unbeaten 143-run opening partnership to set the tone for India’s 84-run victory.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rohtak was lapping up the adulation. Ashwani Kumar, Shafali’s coach for the past four years, remembered how she would prove a handful for the state’s U-19 boys.</p>
      <p>“She was just nine when she came to our Ram Narain Academy and the girls were no match for her. So I started playing her with the U-19 boys. She used to take the U-19 bowlers to the cleaners,” said the former Haryana opener and state team ex-coach.</p>
      <p>On her impact as a power-hitter, Kumar, pointed out: “I know everyone is quite shocked with her fearless approach. Four years ago, I was also stunned when I first saw her batting. She is a bottom-handed batswoman and relies on the punch shots.</p>
      <p>“If you saw the match, you noticed she milked ones and twos and was rotating the strike. At such a tender age, she doesn’t feel nerves, she was calm and calculated. She is a natural talent, just like Sachin was,” he said.</p>
      <p><b>Brief Scores:</b> India Women 185/4 (Shafali Verma 73, Smriti Mandhana 67; Anisa Mohammed 2/35, Shakera Selman 2/36) beat West Indies 101/9 (Shermaine Campbelle 33; Radha Yadav 2/10, Shikha Pandey 2/22) by 84 runs</p>
