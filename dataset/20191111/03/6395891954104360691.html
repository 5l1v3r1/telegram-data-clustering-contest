      <p>Eason Bennett <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/veteran-celebrates-90th-birthday-with-skydive-in-amelia-island/1007024839">was all strapped up and ready to go</a> by 9 a.m. With his granddaughter by his side, he headed toward the runway at Skydive Amelia Island.</p>
      <p>It was a celebration 10 years in the making.</p>
      <p>“He said when he makes it to 90, he wants to jump out of an airplane,” <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/veteran-celebrates-90th-birthday-with-skydive-in-amelia-island/1007024839">his daughter Kathy Bodamer told WJAX</a>. “I guess maybe he didn’t think he’d be around, but he still wanted to do it.”</p>
      <p>The 90-year-old Korean War veteran and Purple Heart recipient hopped on the plane without any second thoughts.</p>

      <p>As he climbed more than 10,000 feet into the air, dozens of his supporters waited for him on the ground.</p>
      <p>Some were waiting their turn to take the jump.</p>
      <p>“My 90-year-old uncle is jumping, so I better give it a shot,” Mark Bennett said.</p>
      <p>Family all the way from California joined his American Legion Post members to watch.</p>
      <p>When the 90-year-old glided gently to safety, he was greeted with applause, hugs and a beer.</p>
      <p>“Oh, it was beautiful,” <a href="https://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/local/veteran-celebrates-90th-birthday-with-skydive-in-amelia-island/1007024839">Eason Bennett said</a>.</p>
      <p>Surrounded by his friends, family and fellow veterans, Bennett said it was a moment he won’t soon forget.</p>
      <p>“Good 90th birthday. Best ever,” he said.</p>
