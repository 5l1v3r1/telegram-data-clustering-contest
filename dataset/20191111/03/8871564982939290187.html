      <h1>Light up your tastebuds at this new eatery and social club in Ubud</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:44:36+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>There’s a brand-new social club and kitchen in the trendy Nyuh Kuning neighborhood that promises to electrify the Ubud social scene! Open from breakfast, <i>Current</i> dishes out a full breakfast and lunch/dinner menu plus a high voltage cocktail list to take you well into the night.</p>
      <p>Health aficionados will be pleased to know that <i>Current</i> uses local, organic ingredients to create a menu that puts a twist on Western and Asian classics inspired by Bali’s wealth of fresh produce. It’s East-meets-West with dishes like breakfast bao buns with house-cured bacon and Kitamani-coffee-braised short ribs. There’s a focus on sharing plates – including ​<i>Tokyo Disco Fries </i>with bonito, octopus and okonomiyaki sauce, and ​<i>Wonton Nachos</i>​ where guac meetschicken karaage. The ​<i>Local AF</i>​ smoothie bowl is a homage to Bali: packed with snake fruit, mangosteen, jackfruit, pandan jelly and palm molasses.</p>
      <p>Beverage-wise, <i>Current</i>’s cocktail list is designed to surprise at a very affordable price. With a locally-sourced arak distilled from red rice, the ​<i>I Wanna Jamu With You</i>​, ​<i>Bali Mule</i>​ and ​<i>Monkey Warrior </i>​cocktails highlight Indonesia’s famous liquor. The non-alcoholic options are equally strong. The 100% organic arabica, single-origin coffee blend is sourced from a local Kintimani farmer and the beans are roasted fresh in-house daily in the kitchen’s custom roaster.</p>
      <p>Indonesian chef and entrepreneur Joshira Yugopradana, the brains behind <i>Current</i>, calls the new venue “A place for Ubud to get down with its casual-sexy self”, adding that it’s been designed to be a spot for the Ubud community to socialize and meet-up over great food, unique cocktails and cool events. Patrons can expect everything from low-key movie nights and talks with guest speakers, to special guest DJ sets and Gin &amp; Tonic Happy Hours.</p>
      <p>Yugopradana’s other restaurants, <i>Laramona</i> and <i>Don U</i>, are already fixtures on the Ubud landscape for their creative and delicious fare. <i>Current</i> is set to delight too, as an ideal place to hang out between home and work (or play!), with a menu to match.</p>
