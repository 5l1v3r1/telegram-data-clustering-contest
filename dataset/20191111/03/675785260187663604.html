      <h1>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer backs Harry Maguire to be Man Utd permanent captain</h1>
      <h2>Maguire was handed the armband and looks set to be long-term skipper after being 'excellent' on and off the pitch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T03:20:31+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 03:20</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said Harry Maguire can be Manchester United's permanent captain after an assured display in the Red Devils' win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> .</p>
      <p>Summer signing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/harry-maguire">Maguire</a> was handed the armband ahead of David de Gea for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/man-utd-3-1-brighton-20853932">United's 3-1 victory</a> at Old Trafford on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And the 26-year-old led by example at the heart of United's defence, commanding the air, snuffing out danger and looking composed in bringing the ball out.</p>
      <p>Veteran Ashley Young is United's club captain, but goalkeeper De Gea has also worn the armband while manager Solskjaer has pondered who should be his permanent skipper.</p>
      <p>But after a win that catapulted <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">United</a> back up to seventh place in the Premier League, it looks like the Red Devils boss may have found his man.</p>

      <p>“Harry is captain material," said Solskjaer in quotes reported by the <a href="https://www.101greatgoals.com/news/man-united-boss-solskjaer-backs-harry-maguire-to-become-a-long-term-captain-after-brighton/">Evening Standard</a> .</p>
      <p>"So is David. David’s been here and done it many, many times, but Harry’s come in and been excellent in the dressing room and on the pitch and that was decision.</p>
      <p>“But he can become the long-term one.”</p>
      <p>Having lingered dangerously close to the relegation zone for some time, United are now nine points off a top four place following Sunday's win.</p>

      <p>Andreas Pereira opened the scoring after his left-footed effort from inside the box took a big deflection off Dale Stephens to wrong foot Matt Ryan in the Brighton goal.</p>
      <p>Just two minutes later United doubled their lead as Davy Propper bundled the ball into his own net following pressure from Scott McTominay after Harry Maguire had headed on from a free-kick.</p>
      <p>Lewis Dunk gave Brighton hope after powering in a header from a corner after 64 minutes.</p>
      <p>But just moments later Marcus Rashford sealed the win with a strike that went in off the underside of the crossbar, although there was still time for him to miss an absolute sitter after Daniel James put the ball on the plate for him with the goal gaping.</p>
      <p>There was bad news for United late on in the game as midfielder McTominay, who has been one of the Red Devils' best players this season, suffered an ankle injury.</p>
