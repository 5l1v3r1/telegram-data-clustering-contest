      <h1>2 shot after Hong Kong police fire live rounds at pro-democracy demonstrators</h1>

      <p>Hong Kong police shot at least two pro-democracy protesters on Monday morning, after the demonstrators attempted to block a busy street.</p>
      <p>The chaos began when a traffic officer started tussling with a protester, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/hong-kong-police-shoot-two-pro-democracy-protesters/2019/11/10/78e436d6-041e-11ea-b17d-8b867891d39d_story.html"><i>The Washington </i><i>Post </i>reports.</a> Another demonstrator then began to approach them, and the officer fired a live round into the person's stomach. Two more rounds were then fired at another protester. A police spokesperson said the two injured demonstrators have been taken to a hospital.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been rocked by unrest for the last five months, with protesters first hitting the streets after a bill was introduced that would make it legal for suspects arrested in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China to face trial. During a protest earlier this month, a demonstrator fell from a parking structure while police tried to disperse the crowd; the protester died on Friday, which led others in the movement to call for a general strike on Monday.</p>
