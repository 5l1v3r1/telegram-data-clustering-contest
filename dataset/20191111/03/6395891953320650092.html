      <p><b>NASSAU COUNTY, Fla.</b> -</p>
      <p>According to police, 23-year-old Ashley Collum was arrested and charged with DUI manslaughter, DUI involving death and failure to stop and render aid after a passenger in the back seat of Collum's car fell out and died Saturday night.</p>

      <p>A press release from the Nassau County Sheriff's Office detailed that after Collum left a party with two passengers in her black Chevrolet Cobalt, witnesses saw a woman in the back seat open the door and fall out of the car. They said the vehicle kept driving and left the scene, so they called 911.</p>
      <p>A deputy arrived shortly afterward and said the woman was facedown in the road, bleeding from her nose and mouth. Paramedics pronounced her deceased when they arrived.</p>
      <p>According to the police report, the passenger in the front seat of the car said it was not unusual for the woman in the back seat to get angry and try to jump out of a moving car and that she had done it before. That's why the witness said they kept driving after the woman fell out.</p>
      <p>Witnesses who were driving nearby told deputies that they saw the woman in the back seat of Collum's car open and close the door without getting out while at a stop sign. Once the car was moving, they watched the woman open the door and fall out headfirst onto the road.</p>
      <p>Collum was arrested early Sunday morning and booked into the Nassau County Jail. Her bail was set at $750,004.</p>
