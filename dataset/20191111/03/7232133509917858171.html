      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After a steady decline, Ethereum found support near the $180 level against the US Dollar. A decent support base was formed and ETH price started an upside correction above $182 (as discussed in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/10/ethereum-price-weekly-forecast-eth-holding-uptrend-support/">weekly forecast</a>).</p>
      <p>Moreover, there was a break above the key $186 and $188 resistance levels. The price even settled above the $186 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. It opened the doors for more gains above the $190 level.</p>
      <p>A high was formed near $192 and the price is currently correcting lower. It is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $180 swing low to $192 high.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are many key supports for Ethereum near the $188 and $186 levels. Additionally, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $186 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $180 swing low to $192 high is also near the $186 level to provide support. Besides, the 100 hourly simple moving average is showing positive signs near the $186 level.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the price remains well supported on the downside near the $188 and $186 levels. If the price fails to stay above the $186 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average, it could move back into a bearish zone.</p>
      <p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $192 level. However, the main resistance is near the $195 level, above which the price is likely to test the $200 resistance area in the near term.</p>
