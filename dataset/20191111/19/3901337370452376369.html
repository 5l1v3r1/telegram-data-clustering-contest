      <h1>Pitso: We Know How To Win The League</h1>

      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane appeared to shrug off the fact that his side, the reigning Absa Premiership champions, head into the Fifa break trailing current log leaders Kaizer Chiefs by 10 points in the title race.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians suffered only their second defeat of the season on Sunday following their 3-2 loss to Golden Arrows at a rain-soaked Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium, while Amakhosi had managed to beat their Soweto rivals Orlando Pirates 2-1 at FNB Stadium a day earlier.</p>

      <p>Asked if it would be difficult to reduce the gap in the coming months, Mosimane suggested Downs were paying very little attention to the table-toppers.</p>
      <p>“If you focus on other people then you will lose the plot. You need to focus on yourself, we know how we win the league. We have won the league four times in the last six years and two times we came second,” Mosimane told reporters.   </p>
      <p>“So this is not new to us. What we need to focus on is Sundowns. At this point in time we are five points behind our programme and our programme is how we win the league. If anybody that has got more than five points (more) then good luck to that person.”</p>
      <p>He said their target was to beat the 71-point record achieved by Sundowns during the 2015/16 season when they clinched the championship.  </p>
      <p>“It means they (Chiefs) have done very well, so you can’t be looking at your neighbour and their new car and saying you also want a new car. You have to focus on ourselves. You can talk about 10 points, but we are five points behind in our programme. Where do we get that programme? We got it when we reached 71 points and we want 72 in total. We are running our own race,” said Mosimane.</p>
