      <h1>Bitcoin Low Timeframe Fractal Matches Weekly Price Action, But Is There More?</h1>

      <p>Fractals are repeating patterns that are commonly found all throughout nature but also playing out on the price charts of financial assets like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
      <p>One prominent crypto trader has pointed out that the current price action playing out on lower timeframes appears to be a fractal of weekly price action, but even the weekly price action may be a fractal from the past.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Market Fractal Playing Out Across Multiple Timeframes</h3>
      <p>Fractals are everywhere. They’re found in the formation of plant leaves, and in the way snowflakes form. They’re also all over <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> charts.</p>
      <p>According to a prominent crypto trader, the current price action on lower timeframe Bitcoin charts, appears to near perfectly match up against the price action taking place across weekly timeframes.</p>

      <p>After a powerful move up on the news that China would be supporting the blockchain technology Bitcoin is built on, resulting in the asset’s third-largest 24-hour price gain ever, Bitcoin began to consolidate, and finally broke down.</p>
      <p>Once the breakdown occurred and the market once again turned bearish, another powerful spike up over the weekend liquidated longs, and the asset has since fallen back down to the $8,700 range where it is currently trading.</p>

      <p>The entire move appears to closely mimic Bitcoin’s parabolic rally in early April, which took the price of the crypto asset to $14,000 before it was rejected and began consolidating.</p>
      <p>Just like the low timeframe movement, Bitcoin price fell from the consolidation trading range, and after setting a local low, spiked back up with strength, but ultimately dropped once again.</p>
      <h3>But Could the Fractal Match Price Action From Peak of Crypto Bubble?</h3>
      <p>The fractal itself that’s playing out on lower timeframes, may be a fractal itself. Current price action on weekly timeframes, when viewed on the 3-day timeframe, appears to perfectly match the price action seen in Bitcoin markets back when the crypto asset set its all-time high price back in December 2017.</p>

      <p>Both charts depict a descending triangle formation, that broke down into a bear flag. The bear flag itself ended up being a bear trap, with a massive spike in the middle that confirmed the descending triangle’s former support as resistance, before the real fall and downtrend began.</p>
      <p>Just as price action played out following the breakdown from all-time high, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/tag/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> could fall into a deep downtrend that mimics the 2018 bear market, before finally returning to a bull run.</p>

      </p>
      <p>After Bitcoin confirmed the descending triangle support as resistance – a price of $13,000 at the time – the crypto asset fell back to local lows around $10,000, and had a substantial drop taking the price of the cryptocurrency to $5,800 in February 2018, shocking fear into the crypto market.</p>
      <p>If the same price action plays out, Bitcoin could once again form a V-shaped low around $5,800 if the bear flag Bitcoin has returned to breaks down – just as it did the last time around. Only time will tell if these fractals are indeed valid, but how similar they appear is certainly convincing.</p>
