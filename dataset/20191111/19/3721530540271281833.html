      <p>On Monday afternoon, <a href="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/x3/X38BR3N7HTDP1573261672394.pdf">Blizzard Entertainment revealed a new <i>Overwatch </i>short story, called Valkyrie</a>, featuring Mercy, also known as Dr. Angela Ziegler. The 24-page short story focuses on Mercy’s time in Egypt, working in an aid camp.</p>
      <p>Being an<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/franchise/overwatch/40333"><i>Overwatch</i></a> story, other heroes like Soldier: 76 and Ana show up to find Mercy. For most of the story, Mercy reflects on her time in the original Overwatch, all while doing normal hero stuff like saving a bunch of kids from certain doom.</p>
      <p>Over the 24 pages, there are some small art pieces showing Mercy doing said heroic things — looking as angelic as usual. But the final shot in the post shows what looks to be a new Mercy skin.</p>
      <p>The skin looks to be Mercy in normal people garb. Instead of her usual healing suit, she’s wearing a lab coat, name tag, sweater, slacks, glasses, and a stethoscope. Weirdly, she’s still wearing her slightly heeled metal combat boots. So she at least intends to conquer some fierce mud on her way home from the clinic.</p>

      <p>We can’t confirm if this is an official <i>Overwatch </i>skin or not — although it sure looks like one. If it is, Blizzard hasn’t announced when it’ll enter the game of how players can pick it up for themselves.</p>
      <p>It’s always nice to play with <i>Overwatch </i>characters in their civilian clothes, and it looks like Mercy players may get that chance soon.</p>
