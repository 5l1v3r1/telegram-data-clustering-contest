      <p>The "RHONJ" husband was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/joe-giudice-leaves-united-states-italy-deportation-appeal">granted permission to travel</a> to his native Italy while waiting on the final decision of his deportation appeal. Teresa said she once tried to get Joe, who is a legal permanent U.S. resident, to apply for U.S. citizenship but never made it a priority over the years. Legal immigrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. and who have not become naturalized U.S. citizens are subject to deportation.</p>
