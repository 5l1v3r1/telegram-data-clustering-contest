      <p>“He was off-duty and in plainclothes at the time of the incident,” Gilland said.</p>
      <p>“We are very sad to announce that one of our Deputies has been arrested,” the Madison County Sheriff’s Office wrote in a Facebook post.</p>
      <p>“It’s a sad day for all Law Enforcement officers,” the post continued.</p>

      <p>Gilland told Fox News that investigators weren’t saying at this time how Adams and Cloer knew each other.</p>
      <p>Adams became a Madison County deputy 15 months ago, according to the <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/breaking-georgia-sheriff-deputy-arrested-murder-charge/oLYOf3g17KjdpplCUn5MrJ/">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>.</p>
      <p>Chief Deputy Sheriff Jeffrey Vaughn told the paper by email that Adams was a model deputy.</p>

      <p>“To be honest we are all blown away by this reaction to a crime of passion,” he said.</p>
      <p>Adams was fired after his arrest, the paper reported.</p>
