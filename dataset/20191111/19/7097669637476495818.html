      <p>BRUSSELS (AP) â€” The European Union on Monday unveiled a system for imposing sanctions on Turkey over its unauthorized gas drilling in Mediterranean waters off Cyprus but no Turkish companies or officials have yet been targeted.</p>
      <p>EU foreign ministers adopted a mechanism making it possible "to sanction individuals or entities responsible for, or involved in, unauthorized drilling activities of hydrocarbons."</p>
      <p>EU member countries can now come forward with names of those they think should be listed.</p>
      <p>The sanctions would involve travel bans and asset freezes on people and "entities" like companies or organizations. EU citizens and firms would be banned from providing them funds.</p>
      <p>Turkish warship-escorted drillships began exploratory drilling this summer in waters where EU-member Cyprus has exclusive economic rights, including areas where European energy companies are licensed to conduct a hydrocarbons search.</p>
      <p>Turkey doesn't recognize Cyprus as a state and claims nearly half of the ethnically split island nation's exclusive economic zone as its own.</p>
      <p>Cyprus was split in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Only Turkey recognizes a Turkish Cypriot declaration of independence.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said Ankara would continue protecting its energy interests and those of Turkish Cypriots and that any hope it would step back from such drilling is "futile."</p>
      <p>The ministry also accused the EU of lending "unreasonable and incomprehensible support to an invalid and ineffective" Cyprus government and of no longer being able to take a "constructive and useful" stand on the search for energy reserves in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>
      <p>The Cypriot government hailed the bloc's decision as a tangible sign of solidarity and that buttresses the country's efforts to defend its sovereign rights against "Turkey's aggressive policies."</p>
      <p>In a statement, Cypriot government spokesman Prodromos Prodromou said it's hoped these legal actions will nudge Turkey into "realizing that it's neither possible nor acceptable to arbitrarily violate international law."</p>
