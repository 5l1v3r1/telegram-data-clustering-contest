      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> awkwardly interrupted her sister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kourtney-kardashian">Kourtney</a> during an interview.</p>
      <p>The Kardashian clan were out in full force at the People's Choice Awards red carpet in Los Angeles on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The three sisters and their mum <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/kris-jenner">Kris Jenner</a> were talking to E! News reporter Giuliana Rancic, 45, who asked what designers they were wearing.</p>
      <p>Eldest sister Kourtney, 40, explained: "I didn't plan this - Naeem Khan? Is that how you say it?"</p>
      <p>Keen to steal the limelight Kim, who recently turned 39, leaned in front of the microphone and interrupted.</p>
      <p>In a cringey display, Kim shouted: "All that matters if that we're wearing KKW Diamonds! That's all that - we're all wearing that." She had no qualms plugging her own perfume line.</p>

      <p>"I was saving you since you didn't know who you were wearing," Kim sassily told Kourtney.</p>
      <p>"No, it's Naeem Khan, I just didn't know how to pronounce it," a quiet Kourtney replied, as Kim offered an: "Oh."</p>
      <p>Now fans have trolled youngest sister Khloe, 35, for not sticking up for Kourtney in the heated moment, saying she didn't deserve the award she had won at the event.</p>
