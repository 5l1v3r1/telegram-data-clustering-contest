      <h1>Another Muslim grave vandalised, this time at foot of Table Mountain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:02:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author">Kamva Somdyala</a></address>
      <p>The chairperson of the Cape Mazaar Society, Mahmood Limbada, says the vandalised gravesite of Auliya Syed Abdul Haq Al Quadri is the work of "Satanists" and people with "sick minds".</p>
      <p>The kramat (burial site for saints in Islam), which is situated in Deer Park on Table Mountain, was vandalised over the weekend.</p>
      <p>"There isn't major damage, but it's disgusting to see," Limbada said on Monday.</p>
      <p>He said the society was trying to find out who the culprits were.</p>
      <p>"There had been visitors who went to the site on Sunday and when they arrived, they saw the damage … we were then alerted and we saw the pictures of blatant vandalism which can only be the work of Satanists and people with sick minds…"</p>
      <p>He added they had speculated on the motivation behind the vandalism but will leave the investigation to the police who currently have no record of a case being open.</p>
      <p>Limbada revealed faeces had been smeared on the kabr (grave), while some of the iron rods surrounding the grave were also dislodged.</p>

      <p>He said there had been a delay in getting a case number, adding the case had definitely been reported to Western Cape police.</p>
      <p>The incident follows the recent <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/muslim-cemetery-desecration-case-breakthrough-imminent-says-neighbourhood-watch-20191101">desecration</a> of at least 80 graves at Mowbray Muslim cemetery.</p>
      <p>Tombstones were ripped out and laid out in the shape of a cross, while some were shoved into open graves in the shape of triangles.</p>
      <p>Cemetery workers also discovered that some of the tombstones taken from other graves were arranged in a triangle inside freshly dug ones.</p>
      <p>Limbada said "we are strongly inclined to believe the two incidents are linked". </p>
