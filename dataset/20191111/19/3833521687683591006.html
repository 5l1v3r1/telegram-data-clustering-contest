      <p>MONTREAL — The maker of the wildly popular game Fortnite is suing a Montreal video game tester for allegedly leaking a new online map ahead of its release date.</p>
      <p>Epic Games International filed a statement of claim in Quebec Superior Court in late October against Lucas Johnston, alleging he was responsible for the publication of "highly confidential information" that amounted to a commercial secret.</p>
      <p>The court document claims Johnston, then an employee of Keywords Studios in Montreal, took a screen shot of a new playing environment on Aug. 30, which later ended up on a Fortnite user forum more than a month before its scheduled Oct. 15 release.</p>
      <p>The allegations against Johnston, who could not be reached for comment, have not been tested in court.</p>
      <p>According to the documents, Johnston admitted taking the screen shot and emailing it to himself but said he didn't know how it ended up online.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit claims the leak robbed the company of the element of surprise, tipped off its competitors to its strategy and affected its reputation among its peers.</p>
