      <p>Jon Jones might be trying to bait Israel Adesanya into an early move up to light heavyweight, but ‘The Last Stylebender’ is sticking to his guns and staying put at middleweight for the time being.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1rE-QI91AA">TMZ Sports</a>, Adesanya doubled down on his comments about wanting to clear out the middleweight division before he inevitably moves up in weight to challenge Jon Jones for the UFC light heavyweight title, telling ‘Bones’ to ‘shut the f-ck up’ and be patient.</p>
      <p>“He will face me eventually, but I’m going to respect the game,” Adesanya said, <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/israel-adesanya-tells-jon-jones-to-shut-the-fck-up-wait-until-he-defends-middleweight-belt-for-superfight/">per BJPenn.com</a>. “I’m going to do what got me to the dance which is honor the game and defend my belt. I mean, he didn’t jump up to heavyweight right after he won the belt. F*ck, you know? I want to do the work. If he wants to come down, come see me boy, if not shut the f*ck up and wait ’til I come see you.</p>
      <p>“I don’t care (about waiting), we’ll still fight at the end of the day. I’m not going to move too fast, cuz I’ve always had a plan and I never deviate from the plan. I’m going to stick to my guns.”</p>
      <p>Adesanya, a former kickboxing champion, last fought earlier this year at UFC 243, where he disposed of Robert Whittaker via second-round KO to unify the middleweight titles. The New Zealander’s first title defense is expected to be against Yoel Romero, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/5/20949625/ufc-president-dana-white-mma-news-interview-israel-adesanya-yoel-romero-paulo-costa-fight">but UFC president Dana White would like to see ‘Soldier of God’ beat another top contender before challenging for the belt again</a>.</p>
