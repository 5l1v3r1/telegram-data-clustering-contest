      <p>Individuals can prove their identity in seconds using the free Yoti app, without having to rely on paper documents. Available for Apple and Android phones, Yoti transforms an individual’s ID document and biometrics into a secure digital identity in less than five minutes.</p>
      <p>Yoti uses <a href="https://www.yoti.com/personal/">256-bit encryption</a> to secure user details and puts individuals in control of their data. With Yoti, the user has to give consent before their details are shared. They also know exactly what details they are sharing and who they are sharing them with. Yoti gives people more control over their personal data by allowing them to share specific identity attributes (i.e. just their name or 18+) without disclosing their full identity, helping to protect them from the ever-growing risk of identity fraud.</p>
