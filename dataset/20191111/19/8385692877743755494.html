      <p>Best Buy isn't putting the Nest Mini <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">on sale</a> just yet, but it is bundling some things with it to make it a really great buy.</p>
      <p>Right now, you can purchase the Nest Mini for its regular price of $49.99, and get a free Wemo Mini Smart Plug (a $29.99 value) with it. That makes this a really good deal.</p>
      <p>Nest Mini also comes with a three month trial to Pandora Premium and a three month SiriusXM Premiere subscription.</p>

      <p>The Nest Mini is the new version of the Google Home Mini â€“ but with a new name, since all of Google's smart home products are now under the "Nest" name. There are a few changes to the Nest Mini, but not many. The biggest change on the outside is the charging port. It's no longer micro USB, unfortunately.</p>
      <p>It still has the Google Assistant built-in, so you are able to talk to your assistant and get things done pretty easily. This includes controlling other smart home products, asking Google for the current weather, or the traffic conditions. And of course, asking Google some questions.</p>
      <p>Now this is a smart speaker, so you still have the ability to play music on this speaker. It supports services like Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music Unlimited and so much more. Making it great for streaming music from your favorite streaming service.</p>

      <p>The Nest Mini is going to be a great stocking stuffer this year, and while it's not discounted right now, getting a free smart plug is definitely worth taking advantage of this deal. And it can be a stocking stuffer for someone else on your list too!</p>
