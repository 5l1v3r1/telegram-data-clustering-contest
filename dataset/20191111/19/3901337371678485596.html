      <p>Mothiba, 23, is set to meet up with Molefi Ntseki and the South African national team as they prepare to face Ghana in a vital African Cup of Nations qualifier this week, and his national coach will be delighted to see him end a tough run of form that was affected by injury and fatigue.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Now though, after his two goals helped Strasbourg climb up the table with a 4-1 victory over Nimes, ‘Lebotelli’ will be buzzing and full of confidence as he looks to add to his Bafana tally in Ghana in a few days.</p>
      <p>His club coach will also be pleased to see Mothiba score again after he got an assist in his last outing for the club, and was quick to praise the young forward for his partnership with Ludovic Ajorque.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, Laurey said, “Lebo Mothiba begins to regain some freshness… He scords two real striker goals, each time on a pass from Ludovic Ajorque. It's important to see a complicity between the players as well. We have to take advantage of this win with four goals to let go a little more and continue in this way." </p>
