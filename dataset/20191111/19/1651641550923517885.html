      <h1>Microsoft is going to make it worth your while to switch from Samsung Cloud to OneDrive</h1>

      <p>We reported recently that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-reportedly-killing-samsung-cloud/">Samsung was encouraging smartphone users in Korea to switch from Samsung Cloud to OneDrive</a> by Microsoft in South Korea, and now <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/onedrive-set-to-replace-samsung-cloud-on-galaxy-devices/">SamMobile reports</a> the feature is also becoming available worldwide as part of the Android 10 beta.</p>

      <p>The feature will be available as an option in the Photos app and it seems to be one-way action, with no way to switch back.</p>
      <p>Only photos and videos are switched, with backups remaining on the Samsung Cloud.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is being particularly generous to Samsung switchers.  Once you switch from Samsung Cloud to OneDrive you get free storage equivalent to what you paid for, for one year, and a refund for any future payments and Microsoft is also offering an additional 15 GB free storage for Samsung users.</p>

      <p>Ultimately of course Microsoft hopes users will sign up for Office 365, which remains a great deal by offering access to Microsoft’s Office Suite and 1 TB of storage for only $9.99 per month.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is partnering very closely with Samsung, with their flagship phones also shipping with Microsoft’s Office Mobile apps and Link to Windows also bringing  Samsung phones closer to your desktop.</p>
      <p>What do our readers think of this deepening relationship? Let us know below.</p>
