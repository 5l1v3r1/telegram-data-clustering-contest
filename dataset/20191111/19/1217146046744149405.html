      <p>Fake sexual harassment complaints appearing to come from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are the latest baits used by attackers to disseminate TrickBot banking Trojan payloads onto computers of unsuspecting employees of large companies.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/">EEOC</a>) is a federal agency responsible for investigating and enforcing federal laws against workplace discrimination.</p>
      <p>Phishing is used by threat actors to deceive their targets into handing over sensitive info using various social engineering techniques, either by using malicious payloads or by redirecting them to fraudulent sites they control via emails that look like they're coming by someone they trust.</p>
      <h3>Spearphishing campaign dropping malicious payloads</h3>
      <p>As part of this campaign, the malware operators use information collected for each target such as their names, the company they work for, their job titles, and even their phone numbers to customize the phishing emails in order to make them a lot more convincing.</p>
      <p>For instance, everything from the email's subject and the message content to the malicious attachment each of the malspam emails come with contains the potential victim's name as <a href="https://www.malcrawler.com/awesome-spear-phish-techniques-from-those-tricky-tricksters-from-trickbot/">MalCrawler discovered</a>.</p>

        <figcaption>Sample phishing email (<i>MalCrawler</i>)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The attackers use <code>Name_of_Victim – A grievance raised against you.</code> subjects for each of the phishing emails to draw in the attention of their targets, with the following customized email body to further instill a sense of urgency:</p>
      <pre>    Dear Name_of_Victim, <br/><br/>    Private and Confidential <br/><br/>    One of your workmates at Victim’s Workplace, has lodged a complaint with the Palos Hills division of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that you manifested behavior considered as sexual harrassment.</pre>
      <p>On top of it all, the malicious attachments that will drop the TrickBot payloads also have customized names of the following format <code>Name_of_Victim – Harassment complaint letter (phone 111-222-3333).doc</code> to further force the user's hand into opening the attachment.</p>
      <p>By adding a "personal touch" to their phishing emails, the attackers greatly increase the chance of their TrickBot payloads being dropped and infecting their victims computers.</p>
      <p>However, it's not all bad news. This campaign's operators fell into the same traps most phishers fall for starting with poor spelling (harrassment instead of harassment) and forms that don't match the rest of the messages' content and logos (a US Federal agency logo with a state of California form) being the most obvious signs of something not being quite right.</p>
      <p>Indicators of compromise (IOCs) including malware sample hashes and the server infrastructure used in this campaign are available at the end of MalCrawler's report.</p>
      <h3>Highly active and regularly upgraded banking Trojan</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tag/trickbot/">TrickBot</a> (also known as TrickLoader, Trickster, or TheTrick), the payload deliverd by this spearphishing campaign, is a continuously evolving banking Trojan with frequently upgraded and newly added capabilities and modules since October 2016 when it was first spotted in the wild.</p>
      <p>While in the beginning it was only designed to harvest and exfiltrate as much sensitive info as possible from infected systems, it has slowly evolved into a popular malware dropper that can infect compromised devices with other even more dangerous malware strains such ransomware.</p>
      <p>TrickBot is also one of the most aggressive malware these days after substituting Emotet as the most distributed strain via malspam campaigns until the latter was revived during August [<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-botnet-is-back-servers-active-across-the-world/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/emotet-revived-with-large-spam-campaigns-around-the-world/">2</a>].</p>
      <p>For instance, in August, a new Trickbot Trojan variant was seen <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-trickbot-variant-targets-verizon-t-mobile-and-sprint-users/">targeting Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, and Sprint users</a> to steal their PIN codes via dynamic webinjects, hinting at its operators' possible involvement or having plans of operating a SIM swap fraud schemes. </p>
      <p>The Google Docs online word processor was also used in an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-bypasses-secure-email-gateway-using-google-docs-phishing/">August TrickBot campaign</a> to infect unsuspecting victims using executables camouflaged as PDF documents.</p>
      <p>TrickBot was seen being upgraded with a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-trojan-gets-icedid-proxy-module-to-steal-banking-info/">new IcedID proxy module for stealing banking info</a> upgrade, adding <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-trickbot-version-focuses-on-microsofts-windows-defender/">Windows Defender circumventing capabilities</a>, and a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/trickbot-trojan-now-has-a-separate-cookie-stealing-module/">module for stealing browser cookies</a>. just in July alone.</p>
