      <h1>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hits back at “bulls***” reports about Arsenal fan relationship</h1>
      <h2>Aubameyang's relationship with YouTube fan channel AFTV, formerly known as ArsenalFanTV, has reportedly irritated key figures at the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:49:49+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Wells, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/darren-wells/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pierre-emerick-aubameyang">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> has hit back at "bulls***" reports his relationship with Youtube channel AFTV is causing a rift at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>The Gunners striker has struck up a friendly rapport with the channel - known formerly as Arsenal Fan TV.</p>
      <p>He has only recently been appointed as Arsenal captain following Granit Xhaka's outburst at fans that saw him stripped of the armband.</p>
      <p>But the 30-year-old's relationship with AFTV is a contentious issue, and is believed to be contributing to unrest in the Arsenal camp.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang responded to the rumours by posting a picture of himself looking glum on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , along with the message: "I just arrived in Gabon and hear a lot of bulls***.</p>

      <p>"I talk with who I want, whenever I want, and if somebody's not happy with... you already know."</p>
      <p>The Gabonese forward then finished his post with a middle finger emoji.</p>
      <p>His response comes following a report by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pierre-emerick-aubameyangs-relationship-youtube-20857864">the Athletic</a> which suggested that the success of AFTV has been largely at the expense of the Arsenal team.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang has 'liked' a number of the channel's posts on social media, including one from June which criticised Emery and another in September which encouraged the sale of Xhaka.</p>

      <p>He has also been engaging with one of the channel's main contributors, Troopz, who Aubameyang has seemingly invited to use his executive box at Emirates previously.</p>
      <p>The channel is known for publishing content from fans on matchdays criticising the team and its players.</p>
      <p>Some Arsenal fans feel Aubameyang's close bond with the channel is a way of trying to avoid criticism himself.</p>
      <p>One Arsenal fan tweeted: "Aubameyang mingling with Troopz is so unprofessional."</p>
      <p>Another said: "The fact Aubameyang is buddies with the AFTV crew should have automatically ruled him out in the running for captaincy."</p>
      <p>Emery said upon appointing Aubameyang to the role: "Aubameyang is first [captain] because he is experienced and he has the respect of the dressing room.</p>
      <p>"He was the top scorer last year in the league and I know he needs time to take that responsibility 100 per cent but we will support him."</p>
