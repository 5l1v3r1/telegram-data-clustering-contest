      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tyler-the-creator">Tyler, the Creator</a> has blasted the people who <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/drake-camp-flog-gnaw-booed-stage-performance-tyler-the-creator-a9197871.html">booed Drake off stage</a> at his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/camp-flog-gnaw">Camp Flog Gnaw</a> festival.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/drake">Drake</a> made a surprise appearance at the event over the weekend, only to be booed by the crowd.</p>
      <p>Concert-goers were apparently expecting Frank Ocean, a collaborator of Tyler, and weren’t pleased when Drake took the stage instead.</p>
      <p>Tyler, in turn, expressed his disappointment at the crowd on Twitter on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I thought bringing one of the biggest artists on the f****** planet to a music festival was fire! But flipside, a lil tone-deaf knowing the specific crowd it drew. Some created a narrative in their head and acted out like a******* when it didn’t come true and I don’t f*** with that,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The rapper said that “mostly everyone was having a great time”, adding: “Those s**** in the front area were the ones being mad rude, which, I can see why, but nah, f*** that, y’all represented me and Flog to my guest and made us look sooo entitled and trash.</p>
      <p>“That s*** was like mob mentality and cancel culture in real life and I think that s*** is f****** trash.”</p>
      <p>Tyler went on to praise Drake’s performance, adding: “Hey man s*** happens, all jokes aside s*** lowkey funny hahaha, aside from that, hope everyone had a good time. Again, no arrest no b******* man a lot of people enjoyed it, thanks again!”</p>
      <p>Drake has yet to comment publicly on his performance.</p>
