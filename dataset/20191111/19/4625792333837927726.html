      <h1>Don Jr. on transgender bathroom debate: 'I wish everyone would share a bathroom'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:46:11+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author">John Gage</a></address>
      <p>Donald Trump Jr. said "no one cares" which bathrooms transgender people use and that he would be okay if everyone just used the same bathroom.</p>
      <p>"I'm a builder. I would love to build one universal bathroom," the president's son said in a Monday interview on Dave Rubin's <i>Rubin Report</i>. "We're real estate people. If I don't have to build dual bathrooms I could actually save a lot of money. I wish everyone would share a bathroom. I think it'd be wonderful."</p>
      <p>The comment came during a discussion over transgender issues on the show. Trump Jr. said he was "live and let live" in regards to gay and transgender people, but that he was concerned that the movement had become about more than equality. He singled out men who had transitioned into women competing in women's sports as a problematic way the gay and transgender lobby was no longer about equality.</p>
      <p>During the 2016 presidential election, President Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-slams-nc-bathroom-law-says-state-should-leave-it-the-way-it-is">slammed North Carolina's bathroom bill</a> that required transgender people to use the bathroom that corresponded to their gender at birth. Trump at the time similarly brought up his son's rational of more bathrooms being expensive.</p>
      <p>"You know there's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is, for transgender, that would be a, first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses," he told NBC host Matt Lauer.</p>
      <p>Trump said at the time that he would allow Caitlyn Jenner to use any bathroom that she wanted in Trump Tower. He later <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-removes-obama-era-transgender-bathroom-guidelines">rescinded an Obama-era rule</a> that forced schools to let transgender students use whatever bathrooms they wanted to.</p>
