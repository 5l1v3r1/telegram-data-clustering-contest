      <p>Black Friday is the most well-known shopping day in the United States, but there's another November date that's encroaching on its territory. Nov. 11 is Single's Day, a consumer holiday that began in China and has steadily built up popularity stateside. On Nov. 11, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/122761-what-is-singles-day-in-china-7-things-to-know-about-the-holiday">ASOS Singles' Day sale </a>is giving customers 20% off site. Yes, you read that correctly.</p>
      <p>Singles' Day began in East Asia with e-commerce company Alibaba and represents a way to celebrate being single. According to <i>CNBC</i>, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/more-us-retailers-to-participate-in-alibabas-singles-day-this-year.html">shopping event began in 2009</a> and has grown in popularity pulling in a whopping <a href="https://www.cmo.com/features/articles/2018/11/14/4-takeaways-from-singles-day-2018.html#gs.fygohe">$30 billion in 2018</a> according to Adobe Analytics. Forbes reports that more US-based brands are getting involved with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/11/08/heres-everything-to-know-about-1111-singles-day">25% of retailers participating in 2019 sales</a>. ASOS is one of them.</p>
      <p>According to the brand, ASOS will be offering a 20% discount on everything, including the over 850 third-party brands on the website, the ASOS premiere program, and next day shipping items. While sure, Singles' Day sales are meant to celebrate you (in what may just be the best self care idea ever), the shopping event also marks the perfect time to check people off your holiday shopping list. With options for men and women in plus, maternity, tall and petite categories as well as a plethora of accessory options and shoes, ASOS is a one-stop fashion shop. On Nov. 11, you can grab any of it at a discount.</p>
