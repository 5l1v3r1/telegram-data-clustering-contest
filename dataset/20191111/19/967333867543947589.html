      <p>The account of South Korean singer-songwriter CL, real name Lee Chae-rin, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkz9_MzSLqpLfgHD8jmI8iA">on YouTube was restored</a> while her Facebook page remains blocked. The artist's social networks account went down for a few hours after local media reported on 7 November that the former 2NE1 member did not renew her contract with YG Entertainment. The move comes after YG Entertainment released an official statement on 8 November confirming that CL won’t be renewing her contract with the agency after 10 years of cooperation.</p>

      <p>​A few hours after the announcement fans were surprised to see that CL's solo Facebook page and Youtube channel were suspended and that she had also been <a href="https://www.ygfamily.com/artist/Artists.asp?LANGDIV=J">removed from the YG family site</a>, while other artists who left YG, such as PSY and Epik High were handed their accounts, and continue to run them.</p>
      <p>Despite the news, fans were happy for their idol and are making positive predictions about the future career of the singer.</p>

      <p>CL has left a big footprint for the K-POP music history. She debuted as a leader and rapper with 2NE1 in 2009 and has led trends in various fields such as music and fashion since then, not only in the band but also as a solo performer. In Japan, she is known as the foremost K-Pop solo female artist, and she was also the first South Korean solo female artist to enter the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2016. </p>
      <p>On February 25 2018, CL performed at the 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony at Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium together with the “choice of the nation” boys band EXO.</p>
