      <h1>De Blasio: Bloomberg should not be the Democratic nominee for president</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:26:52+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.politico.com/states/staff/erin-durkin" target="_blank">Erin Durkin</a></address>
      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio panned former Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s potential run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, calling his predecessor “a billionaire who epitomizes the status quo.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, who previously declared himself out of the 2020 contest, is now eyeing a bid again and filed paperwork Friday to qualify for the primary in Alabama, in time for that state’s deadline to declare.</p>
      <p>De Blasio has already <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/09/20/de-blasio-drops-out-of-2020-presidential-race-1202735">run and folded</a> his own campaign for the Democratic nomination, which never found much support among voters.</p>
      <p>The current mayor, who won his office in 2013 largely by bashing Bloomberg’s record, said national Democrats should steer clear of his predecessor.</p>
      <p>“When he was mayor he had no understanding of the inequality crisis. I think he was absolutely tone deaf to what working people are going through in this city,” de Blasio told reporters after marching in Monday’s Veterans Day parade.</p>
      <p>“Would he be better than Donald Trump? Of course. Should he be the Democratic nominee? No,” de Blasio said. “This is a Democratic Party today that’s getting more progressive, that wants to address the concerns of working people, that does not accept the status quo. There’s no way in the world we should nominate a billionaire who epitomizes the status quo.”</p>
      <p>Bloomberg drew criticism during his time in office for his response to growing homelessness and reliance on stop and frisk, a policing tactic that targeted mostly black and Latino men, but which began to decline significantly toward the end of his mayoralty.</p>
      <p>De Blasio did praise parts of Bloomberg’s record, including his work on gun control, climate change, and public health.</p>
      <p>“I’m objective about the fact that there were some things he did well,” the mayor said. “I can certainly prefer him over Donald Trump. But does he represent today’s Democratic Party? Of course not, not even close.”</p>
      <p>De Blasio has not shied away from relying on <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2019/10/29/de-blasio-presidential-campaign-bankrolled-by-donors-with-city-interests-1226049">wealthy donors</a> for his own campaigns, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2017/01/de-blasios-nonprofit-donors-also-gave-to-candidates-de-blasio-has-denounced-108340">including billionaire</a> George Soros.</p>
      <p>Early polls have not found Bloomberg’s potential candidacy catching fire with voters, with a poll Sunday <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/10/michael-bloomberg-2020-poll-068484">showing him</a> at 4 percent among Democrats nationally.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Bloomberg did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
