      <h1>Google Home Max drops to $250 ($50 off) just in time to rattle the windows at your holiday party</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:21:59+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/cody-english/" target="_blank">Cody English</a></address>
      <p>The Google Home Max, with its impressive volume and audio quality, represents the company's top-tier entry into the smart speaker market. High-end audio products are rarely affordably priced, and the Google Home Max was no exception when it launched at $400 back in 2017. Since then, the Home Max has had its price permanently cut by $100, and buyers can now save an additional $50 when picking up this beast of a smart speaker for only $250 at retailers including <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-home-max-smart-speaker-with-google-assistant-chalk/6124307.p?skuId=6124307">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1365571-REG/google_home_max_charcoal.html//BI/19931/KBID/13015">B&amp;H</a>, and, of course, Google's <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_home_max">online store</a>.</p>
      <p>In our <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/01/04/google-home-max-review-best-expensive-smart-speaker/">review</a>, Ryan found the Home Max to be the best-sounding smart speaker on the market, but he also believed its equally premium pricing could scare off many potential buyers. Today's deal, which brings the total savings to $150 off the original MSRP, could be enough to convince some Assistant-preferring audiophiles to pick one up.</p>
