      <h1>Plymouth Argyle drawn away to Bristol Rovers or Bromley in FA Cup second round</h1>
      <h2>The tie will be played on the weekend of November 30 and December 1</h2>

      <p>Plymouth Argyle will have to wait a little longer to find out their opponents in the FA Cup second round.</p>
      <p>Ryan Lowe’s Pilgrims have tonight been drawn away to Bristol Rovers or National League leaders Bromley.</p>
      <p>Those two teams drew 1-1 at Rovers’ Memorial Stadium in their first round tie on Saturday, after Bromley grabbed an 83 minute equaliser.</p>
      <p>The replay will take place at Bromley’s Hayes Lane ground on Tuesday, November 19 and be televised live on BT Sport 1.</p>
      <p>Bromley have lost on the past 13 occasions they have reached the FA Cup first round proper.</p>
      <p>Their replay against Rovers gives them the chance to reach round two for the first time since 1945/46.</p>
      <p>Argyle will travel to either Graham Coughlan’s Rovers or Bromley on the weekend of November 30 and December 1.</p>
      <p>The winners of the tie will pick up £54,000 in prize money and secure a place in the third round, when all of the Premier League and Championship clubs will enter.</p>
      <p>Rovers, who are ninth in League One under the leadership of Coughlan, had taken a 78th minute lead against Bromley with a goal from substitute Luke Leahy.</p>
      <p>Bromley forced the replay, though, after Chris Bush netted the equaliser from close range.</p>

      <p>The visitors had played the closing 20 minutes of the tie with only 10 players after losing Adrian Clinton to injury and having already used their three permitted substitutes.</p>
      <p>Bromley entered the FA Cup at the fourth qualifying round stage and won 4-3 at home to National League rivals Aldershot Town, with striker Michael Cheek getting two of their goals.</p>

      <p>Argyle have already played Rovers in a cup competition this season, drawing 1-1 with them in an EFL Trophy group game at Home Park in September.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims then picked up a bonus point by winning the resulting penalty shoot-out 5-3.</p>
