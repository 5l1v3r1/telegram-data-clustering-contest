      <h1>BREAKING FA Cup second round draw in full as fixtures are decided</h1>
      <h2>The draw for the second round of the FA Cup was completed on Monday afternoon with all sides just 90 minutes off a potential Premier League opponent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:23:30+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:23</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>The draw for the second round of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup">FA Cup</a> has been completed.</p>
      <p>Those left in the competition are potentially just 90 minutes away from securing a dream money-spinning tie against Premier League opposition.</p>
      <p>A host of non-league clubs remain in the competition at this stage and they now know who they will face for a place in the exclusive third round.</p>
      <p>Among those still in the competition are Chichester City and Maldon &amp; Tiptree, who both play in the eighth tier of English football.</p>
      <p>Maldon remarkably knocked out League Two side Leyton Orient, beating them 2-1 at Brisbane Road.</p>
