      <h1>Florida student says high school rejected pro-life club for 'controversial' views</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:19:20+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:19</time> by <a rel="author">Caleb Parke</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida</a> student alleges her high school rejected a request for a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/abortion">pro-life</a> club and threatened teachers with termination for offering to sponsor the group. But the Naples public school denies the allegations, saying they are trying to help form the group.</p>
      <p>Gabrielle Gabbard, a senior at Gulf Coast High School, says she was not allowed to start "Sharks 4 Life," an independent student group affiliated with Students for Life of America, as an official club for the past two months, while the school allowed <a href="https://www.collierschools.com/domain/1096">dozens of other organizations</a>, including a Gay/Straight Alliance and Animal Rights Club.</p>

      </p>
      <p>After applying in August, Gabbard said she met with the assistant principal, Catherine Crawford-Brown, who told her Sharks 4 Life was "too political and too controversial." Two potential advisers, Gabbard claimed, were discouraged from sponsoring the club.</p>
      <p>This led to the Students for Life of America and Alliance Defending Freedom, a religious liberty law firm, representing Gabbard and sending a <a href="https://adflegal.blob.core.windows.net/mainsite-new/docs/default-source/documents/resources/media-resources/letters/adf-letter-to-collier-county-public-schools-and-gulf-coast-high-school-(2019-11-07)/adf-letter-to-collier-county-public-schools-and-gulf-coast-high-school-(2019-11-07).pdf?sfvrsn=901e2e1d_2">letter</a> on her behalf to the Collier County Public School Board on Nov. 7.</p>
      <p>In the letter, Gabbard's advocates demanded that the school board help the pro-life club get access, assure teachers in writing they won't be fired for helping, and pass a resolution so that no other student faces similar discrimination.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But Chad Oliver, a spokesman for the Collier County Public Schools, told Fox News the allegations are "simply wrong."</p>
      <p>"The school has been ready to open the club but needs to have a faculty advisor/sponsor before it can open," Oliver said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Pushing back against Gabbard's claims, the district added: "The assistant principal never met with two faculty advisors about the opening of the club. She met with a member of the non-instructional staff who supported the club and two students. At no time did the assistant principal threaten anyone with job loss. The faculty member who originally agreed to serve as a faculty advisor to the club informed the Principal on September 4 that she had decided not to do so. The assistant principal has never spoken with this faculty member about this matter."</p>

      <p>Michael Ross, Gabbard's attorney at Alliance Defending Freedom, told Fox News the school quickly changed its stance on the pro-life club and only started cooperating after being threatened with a lawsuit.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.adfmedia.org_files_GabbardLetter.pdf&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;r=pVOV7DTNaPZo_vJeBkJSFeifvSaKJg8j82Kct4-Xed8&amp;m=PW21EZKqyliUQ6o1AIxrulul1XXt5iiuX_p7AaPlmfE&amp;s=3zspSCD8JWMWFizKZVjiMTmc-It6O_ZD-LG26t8couk&amp;e=">ADF’s demand letter</a> clearly recounts Gulf Coast High School’s repeated refusal to recognize Sharks 4 Life for over three months," Ross said. "The facts leave no doubt that they were ill-treated and ignored because of their viewpoint. The only apparent attempt from GCHS to recognize Sharks 4 Life comes after a threat of legal action. Students shouldn’t have to threaten legal action to have their voice heard.“</p>
