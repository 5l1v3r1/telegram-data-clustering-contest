      <h1>FEEL GOOD: Is a granny's letter to Rassie Erasmus the key to the much lauded subs strategy?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:35:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jan Gerber</a></address>
      <p>Was the threat of a good "<i>patz</i>" from one patriotic granny in her 90s perhaps the motivation for Springbok coach Rassie Erasmus to get his substitutions strategy perfect in the Rugby World Cup?</p>
      <p>A heartwarming letter shared on the popular <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hashtagimstaying/permalink/452286369044089/">Facebook</a> group #ImStaying might prove to hold the clue.</p>
      <p>While Erasmus' use of substitutions has been hailed by rugby analysts as a major factor in the Springboks' victorious World Cup campaign, it was widely questioned last year after a match which the Boks narrowly lost to the then reigning world champions and bitter South African rivals, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Julia Markus <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/hashtagimstaying/permalink/452286369044089/">shared</a> a letter on the group which her rugby-mad granny, now 93, sent to Erasmus last year.</p>
      <p>"I know the RWC has come and gone, but I wanted to share the following. My grandmother is 93 years old. She will be 94 in March. I like to think she is one of the oldest, if not biggest Springboks supporter. When we won, she watched the highlights on repeat x3 times! (Didn't we all)," Markus posted.</p>
      <p>The letter reads as follows: "Dear Mr. Erasmus</p>
      <p>"Mazaltov [congratulations] to you and your team! You have done wonders with the Springboks. I have watched rugby since the 1940s - walked all the way from the top of Oranjezight and caught the train to Newlands rugby ground every Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I watched Okie Geffen, James Small and all the super rugby commentators on TV. I am aged in the 90s and nearly landed in the Pinelands cemetery on Saturday. How the HECK could you change your perfect team, 10 minutes before the end against New Zealand - you know they always win in the second half. DON'T YOU EVER DO THAT AGAIN! - I would come and give you a good <i>patz</i> (hiding) if I was your mother. However, all forgiven!</p>
      <p>"Lots and lots of good luck for the next four games overseas. If I am not here for the World Cup and we win, I'll send you a postcard from above. <i>Totsiens en alles van die beste</i>Â (Goodbye and best wishes).</p>
      <p>"PS. <i>Ek is 'n ou Namaqualander</i> (I'm an old Namaqualander)."</p>
      <p>While it is unclear if the letter ever reached Erasmus, the post was well received on Facebook.</p>
      <p>It had been liked nearly 3 000 times, and been shared more than 150 times by 14:30 on Monday. Among those who commented is the mother of late Springbok wing and 1995 World Cup winner, James Small.</p>
      <p>"James would have been humble, but would have loved the special mention. Salute you Mam," Vourn Small responded to the post.</p>
      <p>Several of the people who commented suggested that Erasmus and the Boks pay her a visit.</p>
