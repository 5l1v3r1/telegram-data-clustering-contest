      <p>HONG KONG: Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam said on Monday (Nov 11) the violence that is roiling the former British colony has exceeded protesters' demands for democracy and demonstrators are now the people's enemy.</p>
      <p>Lam was speaking hours after police shot a protester, a man was set alight and volleys of tear gas were fired at lunch time in the heart of the financial centre in some of the most dramatic scenes to grip the city during months of unrest.</p>

      <p>"If there's still any wishful thinking that by escalating violence, the Hong Kong SAR government will yield to pressure, to satisfy the so-called political demands, I'm making this statement clear and loud here: That will not happen," she said in one of her most defiant televised addresses.</p>
