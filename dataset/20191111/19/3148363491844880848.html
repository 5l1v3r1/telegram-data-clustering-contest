      <h1>Lawyer: Florida High School Threatened Teacher's Job over Pro-Life Student Group | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>The assistant principal at Gulf Coast High School in Naples, Florida, allegedly threatened a teacher with termination over the teacher’s involvement with a pro-life student group on campus. After receiving a demand letter from a law firm threatening to sue the school district for viewpoint discrimination, the school says that it will approve the pro-life group.</h2>

      <p>Students for Life of America and Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) sent a <a href="http://www.adfmedia.org/files/GabbardLetter.pdf">demand letter</a> last week calling on Gulf Coast High School (GCHS) to approve the school’s Students for Life group, as well as “change their policies district-wide to ensure that no other student faces similar discrimination,” according to the organization.</p>
      <p>The pro-life organization told Breitbart News in a statement that an application to start the group “Sharks 4 Life” was denied by Gulf Coast administrators, adding that one of the teachers, Linda Cassidy, was threatened with termination after meeting with the school’s assistant principal, Catherine Crawford-Brown about approving the pro-life group.</p>
      <p>“At the meeting, Ms. Crawford-Brown also made pointed remarks numerous times that if Ms. Cassidy continued to try and be a faculty advisor, she could lose her job,” alleges the demand letter. “Specifically, she stated at one point, ‘you better watch it, Linda.'”</p>
      <p>“Ms. Crawford-Brown made these remarks even though she knew that the club needed a faculty advisor to be approved,” the letter continues. “Because of these remarks, Ms. Cassidy stated that day that she did not want to be an advisor for Sharks 4 Life.”</p>
      <p>The letter goes on to allege that when Cassidy later informed a second teacher, Linda Townsend, of what had been said to her at the meeting, Townsend also withdrew her application to be the pro-life group’s faculty advisor.</p>
      <p>“Ms. Cassidy relayed what Ms. Crawford-Brown said at that meeting to Ms. Townsend,” states the letter. “Ms. Townsend is a single mom and was afraid that she would lose her job, so she told Ms. Cassidy that she was withdrawing as a faculty advisor. Soon after, she sent an email to Ms. Crawford-Brown and Principal Mikuslki confirming her withdrawal.”</p>
      <p>Gulf Coast High School, however, denies these allegations, stating that the assistant principal never met with the two potential faculty advisors regarding the approval of the pro-life group.</p>
      <p>“The assistant principal never met with two faculty advisors about the opening of the club,” said a GCHS spokesperson to Breitbart News. “She met with a member of the non-instructional staff who supported the club and two students. At no time did the assistant principal threaten anyone with job loss.”</p>
      <p>“The faculty member who originally agreed to serve as a faculty advisor to the club informed the Principal on September 4 that she had decided not to do so,” the spokesperson added. “The assistant principal has never spoken with this faculty member about this matter.”</p>
      <p>Students for Life, however, contends that while assistant principal Crawford-Brown did not meet with both faculty advisors, she did meet with one.</p>
      <p>“Thank you for meeting with Linda, Ava, and myself today,” said the pro-life group’s student president to Crawford-Brown in an email obtained by Breitbart News. Students for Life told Breitbart News that the correspondence was a follow-up email after the meeting with GCHS’ assistant principal — with “Linda” referring to faculty advisor Linda Cassidy.</p>
      <p>“I just want to summarize what we discussed,” added the student in her email. “You explained that Gulf Coast does not want to be known as either pro-life or pro-choice that it could cause parental upset. You do not suspect that they will allow us the opportunity to have a pro-life club at Gulf Coast.”</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, GCHS maintains that the school had never refused approval of the pro-life group.</p>
      <p>“The claim that Gulf Coast High School administrators ever refused to allow the opening of the Sharks 4 Life Club is simply wrong,” affirmed the GCHS spokesperson to Breitbart News. “The claim that the club is not recognized by GCHS is wrong.”</p>
      <p>“GCHS, like other District high schools, has a plethora of clubs on site that include faith-based clubs, non-faith based clubs, and so on that meet at lunch or after school with their respective faculty sponsors,” the spokesperson added. “District policy encourages such club participation.”</p>
      <p>“Gulf Coast High School has been and is ready to open the club,” said the spokesperson. “The Principal will be reaching out to students interested in forming the Sharks 4 Life Club on Monday and finding a sponsoring faculty member.”</p>
