      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> are in the midst of a major injury crisis.</p>
      <p>With seven defeats in their opening 12 Premier League games, Dean Smith's men sit one place above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>As well as losing their most recent game against Wolverhampton Wanderers, they were dealt the cruelest of hands on the injury front.</p>

      <p>Jack Grealish, Bjorn Engels and Tom Heaton all missed the game completely, whilst second choice keeper Jed Steer and Matt Targett limped out of the action at Molineux.</p>
      <p>All those now face a race to be fit for their Villa Park clash with Newcastle United, but on the horizon are a series of daunting looking fixture for the Villans.</p>

      <p>Following the game against the Magpies, Villa face Manchester United, Chelsea, Leicester and surprise package Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>And one man that faces missing one of those games is Frederic Guilbert. The Frenchman has been in fine form since coming into the side after his January move.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But he picked up his fourth booking of the season in the defeat to Wolves, meaning he is now walking a disciplinary tightrope. Bans for accumulation of yellow cards last up until 19 fixtures into the season, meaning in all likelihood, Smith will have to cope without his first choice right back in at least one fixture.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has a reputation for getting on the wrong side of referees and has been booked a staggering <b>25 times</b> since the start of the 2017/18 season.</p>
