      <p>Last Christmas director Paul Feig hopes the film offers a message of understanding in “divisive times”.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker believes there is a lot of anger and cynicism in the current political climate, and hopes his festive release can provide an antidote.</p>
      <p>Asked about the message of the film to a country still gripped by Brexit divisions, the Bridesmaids director said he wanted people to “give each other a break”.</p>
      <p>The film follows the erratic life of Emilia Clarke’s heroine Kate, who has fled with her family from the former Yugoslavia to begin a new life in London.</p>

      <p>Clarke herself has said the film, co-written by Brexit-critic Dame Emma Thompson, is “important” in a post-referendum UK.</p>
      <p>Feig told the PA news agency: “I think the nice message of this movie is just, ‘we’re all in this together’.</p>
      <p>“We’re all trying to get by. We all have our own problems. We just have to understand each other more, and just give each other a break.”</p>
      <p>The film makes use of a soundtrack of George Michael and Wham! hits, and co-stars Dame Emma and Henry Golding.</p>
      <p>Feig hopes the festive feature will counter-act some of the political divisiveness he perceives today.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the BFI Southbank in London, he said: “This is a very divisive time, and it’s a very angry time.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of cynicism around, you need stuff like this to remind, again, we’re all in this together.”</p>
      <p>Last Christmas is out in cinemas from November 15.</p>
