      <p>Amorita Resort is thrilled to announce that it has been recognized by three prestigious award-giving bodies: World Luxury Hotel Awards, Luxury Travel Guide Awards, and Conde Nast Johansens Awards for Excellence.</p>
      <p>The resort is honored that it has recently received the coveted <b>Conde Nast Johansens’ Award for Excellence</b> as <b>Best for Families </b>for 2020. This is Amorita Resort’s third win from the distinguished annual awards: Best for Service in 2017 and 2019. From the publishers of Vogue, GQ, Travellers, and Glamour, Conde Nast Johansens is the leading reference guide for independent travelers. It hand-selects the best properties from around the world to include in their exclusive collection. The global awards were created to “acknowledge, reward, and celebrate excellence” across their highly recommended properties. The annual Conde Nast Johansens’ Awards for Excellence serves as an indicator of quality, earning the trust of discerning consumers and travel professionals alike. The winners were determined from online voting, guests’ feedback, and local expert reports.</p>
      <p>Amorita Resort is also proud to announce that it recently received the<b> Resort of the Year Award</b> by the <b>Luxury Travel Guide (LTG) Awards</b>. Recognizing consistent performance in the luxury travel and hospitality industry, the Luxury Travel Guide Awards is the resort’s first nomination and win from this prestigious award-giving body. Deserving nominees are put forward by industry experts, readers, and satisfied customers. Meanwhile, in-house professionals and guest judges will then pick those most deserving of recognition. Throughout the past year, the Luxury Travel Guide Awards has received tens of thousands of nominations from different countries and the winners were chosen based on their specialization, location, wellness facilities, and most importantly, service excellence.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the resort was also named as the country’s <b>Top Luxury Villa Resort</b> in the recently held <b>World Luxury Hotel Awards</b>. The awarding ceremony took place in Finland last October 12 and saw over 300 participants who flew in to celebrate the luxury hospitality industry. Already on its 13<sup>th</sup> year, the World Luxury Hotel Awards recognizes the finest global properties that aim to enhance guest experiences through world-class facilities and exceptional service. The winning hotels and hospitality groups were rated by over 300,000 guests, travelers, and industry players during a six-week voting process. This most recent award gave Amorita Resort its fourth win from the award-giving body: Best Luxury Family Hotel and Best Luxury Romantic Hotel in 2017; and Best Luxury Boutique Resort in 2018.</p>
      <p>These awards are a testament of the resort’s commitment to excellence and to providing guests the most memorable experiences through personalized service and distinct Filipino hospitality. This combination has resulted in guests returning time and again, recognizing Amorita Resort as their second home.</p>
