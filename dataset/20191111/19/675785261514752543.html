      <h1>General election: Ex-Tory minister says Boris Johnson 'has betrayed every woman who ever loved him'</h1>
      <h2>Nick Boles left the Conservatives in April, but he had been a close ally of Boris Johnson in the past - working for him when he was Mayor of London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T19:34:07+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Milne, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/oliver-milne/</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson is a "compulsive liar" who has "betrayed every woman who has ever loved him" an ex-Tory minister and former close ally has said.</p>
      <p>Nick Boles, who resigned the Conservative whip in April over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , launched the ferocious attack on Mr Johnson - and said he would vote Lib Dem at the next election.</p>
      <p>In his attack on Mr Johnson, Mr Boles described the PM as an “all-consuming ego utterly without conscience”.</p>
      <p>Mr Boles was Mr Johnson’s chief of staff when the latter was first elected Mayor of London in 2008 and backed the Brexiteer to be Tory leader in 2016.</p>
      <p>But now he says his former boss “has turned the party of Disraeli and Churchill into a vehicle for shrill English nationalism” and would “betray the NHS in a heartbeat".</p>
      <p>His public rebuke of Mr Johnson will cause dismay inside the Conservative campaign, who will be worried that Mr Boles' message will resonate with moderate Conservative voters angry over the party's increasingly hard-right posturing.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/appalling-choice-contest-must-start-the-process-of-building-something-new-a4283876.html">Writing in the Evening Standard</a> , Mr Boles said Mr Johnson was "a  compulsive liar who has betrayed every single person he has ever had any dealings with, every woman who has ever loved him, every member of his family, every friend, every colleague, every employee, every constituent."</p>
      <p>Mr Boles, who stood down as the MP for Grantham and Stamford last week, said he would now back the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a> as he trusted them to “pursue the closest possible relationship with the European Union after Brexit”.</p>
      <p>He also slammed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> , who he said had offered “a lifetime of support for terrorists, murderers and racist thugs”.</p>
      <p>“If Labour wins a majority next month, the public will vote to install an anti-Semite in No 10 Downing Street,” he added.</p>
