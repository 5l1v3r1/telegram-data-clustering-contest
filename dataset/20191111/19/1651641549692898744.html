      <p>OnePlus is now on the lookout for beta testers for its Zen Mode app. It’s an effort to bring faster progress in the development of the app and to engage more with its users.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, in order to join the beta program, you will need a OnePlus smartphone that has support for the Zen Mode app. Currently, OnePlus 5/5T, 6/6T, 7/7T, and 7/7T Pro are the smartphone, on which you’ll be able to install the Zen Mode app. Also, the app requires your smartphone to run Android 9 or higher.</p>
      <blockquote>We’re glad to tell you that we have launched the Zen Mode 1.4.1 Beta version on Play Store and we are looking for users to join the Beta program to help improve this feature.<br/>Please keep in mind that your opinion matters to OnePlus and we’re looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!</blockquote>
      <p>If you want to become a beta tester, you’ll need to <a href="https://ww.9to5google.com/?load=aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5Lmdvb2dsZS5jb20vYXBwcy90ZXN0aW5nL2NvbS5vbmVwbHVzLmJyaWNrbW9kZQ&amp;r=1">click on this link</a>.</p>

You’ll receive an update that includes a testing version of the OnePlus Zen Mode app.</blockquote>
      <p>For those who’re using the Zen Mode app, OnePlus has also released a new update to the app. Taking the app to Version 1.4.1, the update adds a few interesting new features alongside bug fixes and performance improvements. You can see the changelog below.</p>
      <h3>Changelog</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Fixed bugs related to notifications</li>
        <li>Optimized the visual effect of sharing cards</li>
        <li>Added feedback dialog.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For those unaware, Zen mode, when enabled, keeps track of how much you use your smartphone and if your usage crosses a certain limit, it’ll lock you out of your smartphone. As a result, you won’t be able to use your smartphone for at least 20 minutes. You’ll, however, be able to take photos, make and receive phone calls during that time.</p>
