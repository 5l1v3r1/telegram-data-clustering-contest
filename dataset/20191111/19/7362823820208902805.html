      <h1>The Veronicas' Jess' and Lisa get candid about relationship with Ruby Rose tearing them apart</h1>

      <p>Their new reality show is being touted as an inside look at their reconnection, but little is known about the tumultuous time when The Veronicas twins fell apart.</p>
      <p>Jess and Lisa Origliasso, both 34, are discussing their show "The Veronicas: Blood is for Life," which<a href="https://www.foxtel.com.au/now/index.html?utm_source=news.com.au&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=tv-drama&amp;utm_content=NCAFoxtelEditorial"> airs on Foxtel’s MTV</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>It is a transparent look at their everyday lives as they rekindle their bond in the wake of a rocky couple of years.</p>
      <p>In an interview with news.com.au ahead of the show’s premiere, Lisa revealed she and Jess went through a period where they completely cut off communication amid <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/blood-is-thicker-than-water-the-veronicas-vs-ruby-rose/news-story/e8b4b53b7e775161f68544814d775774">Jess’ reconciliation with her now ex-girlfriend, Hollywood star Ruby Rose.</a></p>

      <p>“We as twin sisters have a bond that cannot really be explained to anybody else. We feel it in the deepest parts of who we are, and even in hard times … I guess somewhere we always knew that. But we went through a very difficult time where we weren’t communicating,” Lisa said.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t in communication with each other.”</p>
      <p>The Aussie pop duo began to fall apart in 2016 around the time their single "On Your Side" was released, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/music-videos/ruby-rose-and-jess-origliasso-star-in-steamy-music-video/news-story/8e76dbb3f173782237546bb8e7944206">which Rose directed and starred in as she and Jess rekindled their romance,</a> having previously dated in 2008.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t long before tensions began to surface publicly, seemingly over Lisa’s apparent feud with Rose.</p>
      <p>When news.com.au posted a headline “Veronica’s not happy” in October 2017, in relation to On Your Side not being nominated for an ARIA Award, Lisa retorted: “Jessica Veronica. Not The Veronicas.”</p>

      <p>That same year, <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/ruby-rose-says-she-is-girlfriend-jessica-origliassos-protector-amid-public-spat-with-lisa-origliasso/news-story/2911047bc496f345a9256093de576503">Rose blasted Lisa in a since-deleted tweet for having celebrated the Yes vote result on same-sex marriage: </a>“So glad to see Lisa Origliasso screaming in excitement about the yes vote after telling us she thinks we should feel ‘lucky’ we don’t get stoned to death like they do in other countries and get over it a few months ago … Really warms my heart,” Rose tweeted, along with an eye-roll emoji. Jess aligned herself with Rose at the time.</p>
      <p>On top of that, there were delays in releases to The Veronicas’ fourth studio album the twins put down to “personal circumstances out of (their) control,” which fans assumed was due to their mother Colleen’s ongoing battle with dementia.</p>
      <p>Following Jess and Rose’s nasty split in April 2018, it seemed the twins finally got their relationship back on track.</p>
      <p>Lisa said their time apart made them appreciative of how far they had come.</p>
      <p>“Our mum’s not been well, a lot of things happened around that time that put things into perspective,” she said.</p>
      <p>“That makes us appreciate now what we have in our lives. Jess is engaged, I’m married.</p>

      <p>“We have this unbreakable bond that’s really prevailed, and you definitely see on the show, we do talk about that journey.”</p>
      <p>Lisa also revealed you’d see every part of who the twins are on their show, including the “ugly side.”</p>

      <p>“When we signed up to do the show we said we didn’t want any part to be contrived, it had to be real,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We’re uncensored because we’re so comfortable. I think our appeal is we speak our truth.</p>
      <p>“We’re used to being around cameras, so it’s easier for us to have those authentic moments, and because of it, you’re seeing every side of who we are.</p>
      <p>“It’s the ugly side, the fighting, the vulnerable moments, the challenges we’ve been facing with family, as well as the glam moments of being The Veronicas.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t want to censor any part of it. It’s scary, it’s confronting, it’s every aspect of our humanity, and that’s what we wanted it to be.”</p>
      <p>On the music front, Lisa revealed the pair would finally be releasing their fourth studio album – ideally this summer – as well as their first-ever perfume.</p>
      <p>“We’ll be dropping a couple of songs pretty soon,” she said.</p>

      <p>“The songs are almost like the soundtrack to our lives. They’re a lot like the reality show, very raw. We’re singing about things we’ve been through these last few years.</p>
      <p>“It has a very dreamy ’80s undertone to it. An emotive vibe mixed in with our big pop bangers.”</p>
