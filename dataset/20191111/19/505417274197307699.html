        <b>Leinster and Munster have both issued injury updates ahead of the opening round of the Heineken Champions Cup this weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both provinces emerged victorious from the round of Interprovincial action in the PRO14.</p>
      <p>Leinster secured a bonus-point 42-11 victory over Connacht in Galway and the good news for the eastern province is that Robbie Henshaw returns to training this week after the Ireland centre was removed from the matchday squad for the clash with Andy Friend’s side due to illness.</p>
      <p>Seán Cronin, who sustained a neck injury during the World Cup, will continue his rehabilitation with some light skill work this week but remains unavailable. As does prop Vakh Abdaladze who is currently ruled out of contention with a back injury.</p>

      <p>Will Connors, who put in a good shift against Connacht, was removed with a head injury towards the end of the game and he will follow the return-to-play protocols.</p>
      <p>In more positive news, Hugo Keenan and Ed Byrne both made successful returns from their respective injuries in the win over Connacht and there are no further issues to report.</p>
      <p>Long-term absentees Fergus McFadden (elbow), Jack Conan (foot), Barry Daly (knee) and Dan Leavy (knee) remain unavailable for selection.</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>For Munster, they have a few injury worries ahead of their Champions Cup opener with the Ospreys on Saturday.</p>
      <p>JJ Hanrahan was removed with a suspected hamstring injury in the win over Ulster at Thomond Park. He is set to have a scan on the injury on Monday evening but his participation for the trip to Wales looks extremely doubtful.</p>
      <p>Tyler Bleyendaal is the only senior out-half remaining due to Joey Carbery’s absence with an ankle injury.</p>

      <p>A calf injury has been confirmed for Dave Kilcoyne which he suffered last week in training and he will now undergo rehabilitation with the medical department.</p>
      <p>Chris Cloete failed a HIA in the win over Ulster and he will now follow the return-to-play protocols.</p>
      <p>In better news, both Alex Wootton and Craig Casey have returned to training after their respective injuries.</p>
      <p>Rhys Marshall (knee), Darren Sweetnam (hamstring), Joey Carbery (ankle), Ciaran Parker (calf) will not be in contention for the weekend.</p>
