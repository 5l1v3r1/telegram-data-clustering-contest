      <p>Let's face it, as Netflix continues to ramp up the production of its own original content, more and more of said content gets lost in the shuffle. Only a few of the streaming giant's originals have broken through the clutter to gain a serious following, but when they do, they <i>really</i> break through. And among the many new <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/new-netflix-november-2019-movies-tv-shows-include-original-holiday-content-17909331">movies &amp; tv shows coming to Netflix this week</a> is the return of one of the site's most successful and acclaimed creations to date: <i>The Crown</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/when-does-the-crown-season-3-premiere-the-historical-drama-will-undergo-some-dramatic-changes-during-the-break-6684837"><i>The Crown</i> season 3 is set to premiere </a>on Nov. 17, and the show is taking a big risk in its new season. Rather than resting on its laurels after the first two awards-filled seasons,<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-crown-season-3-teaser-reveals-when-new-episodes-will-finally-hit-netflix-video-18567835"><i> The Crown</i> has changed its cast</a> for season three. No longer will Emmy-winner Claire Foy and Matt Smith portray Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, respectively. Instead, they've been replaced by Oscar-winner Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies. This change is due to the new season depicting events from a later period in the queen's life, as it will cover the 1960s and 1970s while also featuring an older and more prominent Prince Charles, now played by Josh O'Connor.</p>
