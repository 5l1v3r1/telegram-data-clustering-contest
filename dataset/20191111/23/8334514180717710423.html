      <p>(Reuters) - Bankrupt California power producer PG&amp;E Corp is offering $13.5 billion in compensation to wildfire victims as part of a restructuring plan, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people with knowledge of the situation.</p>
      <p>The same amount has been offered to the victims by a rival group of noteholders led by Pacific Investment Management Co and Elliott Management Corp, according to the report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/pg-e-offering-13-5-billion-in-compensation-to-wildfire-victims.">here</a></p>
      <p>PG&amp;E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January after massive wildfires struck Northern California in 2017 and 2018, which were blamed on its equipment.</p>
      <p>A lawyer for the committee of wildfire victims said last month their claims may be worth $13.5 billion, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E had previously proposed to provide $8.4 billion in compensation, but the victims sided with the noteholders in the hopes of getting more money.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E and the victims were in talks on Monday, Bloomberg reported.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E did not immediately respond to Reuters request for a comment.</p>
