      <h3>Part of Project Ubin</h3>
      <p>In a bid to <a href="https://btcmanager.com/ripple-nus-fintech-growth-singapore/">propel</a> the use of blockchain technology in the local financial industry, Singapore’s MAS has forged a strategic alliance with multiple financial services giants to develop a platform that will enable interoperability and integration among various blockchains.</p>
      <p>Per sources close to the matter, the tri-party business deal is part of Project Ubin – a multi-party tech project undertaken by the MAS with industry players to explore the use of DLT for the clearance and settlement of payments and securities.</p>
      <p>In the fifth phase of the project, the involved parties – the MAS, JP Morgan Chase, and Temasek – will look to offer features including delivery-versus-payment (DvP) settlement with private exchanges, conditional payments and escrow for trade, and payment commitments for trade finance.</p>
      <p>The MAS added that currently, the project is undergoing industry testing phase which involves gauging the platform’s ability to integrate with commercial blockchain applications.</p>
      <h4>Expert Opinions</h4>
      <p>Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief Fintech Officer, MAS, expressed his enthusiasm on the development stating:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>There is growing evidence now that blockchain-based payments are able to enhance cost efficiencies and create new opportunities for businesses…We look forward to linking up with more blockchain networks to improve cross-border connectivity. This will be a big step forward in making cross-border transactions faster, cheaper, and safer.</b>”</blockquote>
      <p>Echoing similar sentiments was John Hunter, Global Head of Clearing and Interbank Information Network (IIN), JP Morgan. Hunter noted:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>JP Morgan is excited to be an infrastructure partner of MAS and Temasek for Phase 5 of Project Ubin. By leveraging our key learnings from building the Interbank Information Network (IIN) and the JPM Coin, JP Morgan is well-positioned to support the development of a blockchain-based payments network and operate at scale.</b>”</blockquote>
