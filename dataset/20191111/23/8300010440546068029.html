      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- U.S. Catholic bishops are likely to make history this week as they choose a new president of their national conference.<br/><br/>Los Angeles Archbishop Jose Gomez, an immigrant from Mexico, is expected to be elected as the first Hispanic president of the bishops' conference during a three-day meeting beginning in Baltimore Monday.<br/><br/>Gomez has been an outspoken advocate for immigrants. He is considered a practical-minded conservative, but he is a vocal advocate of a welcoming immigration policy that would include a path to citizenship for many immigrants in the United States illegally.<br/><br/>In August, after a gunman killed 22 people at a Walmart in Texas, Gomez wrote a blog post condemning white supremacy and noting that Spanish was spoken in North America before English was.<br/><br/>"Men and women do not become less than human, less a child of God, because they are 'undocumented,'" Gomez wrote.<br/><br/>The bishops will also consider proposed changes in the process of preparing seminarians to become priests to reduce the likelihood of sexual misconduct.<br/><br/><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p>
