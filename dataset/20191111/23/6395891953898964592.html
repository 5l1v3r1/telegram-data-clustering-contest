      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - Dreamers in New England and across the country are gearing up to fight a ruling against DACA that is now moving to the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>President Trump ordered an end to DACA, or Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, back in 2017, but his motion was blocked by federal courts in several different states. </p>
      <p>Those protected under DACA, called Dreamers, say the program is full of success stories.</p>
      <p>Created in 2012 by the Obama administration, DACA has protected those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children or came with families that overstayed visas. DACA recipients were able to obtain social security numbers, work permits and protections from deportation.</p>
      <p>In many cases, Dreamers were brought to the U.S. at such a young age that they have no recollection or connection to their home country.</p>
      <p>Currently, over 700,000 people are protected under DACA.</p>
      <p>With the attempted elimination of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, there was renewed pressure in Congress to pass the DREAM Act, or Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors, a series of never-passed proposals to protect young immigrants vulnerable to deportation.</p>
      <p>Opponents say the law rewards people for breaking the law, encourages illegal immigration and hurts American workers.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration argues that the program is unlawful because former President Barack Obama did not have the authority to adopt it in the first place.</p>
      <p>Eva Milona with MIRA, or Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, says she's hopeful the Supreme Court will rule to keep DACA in place. Milona says she also hopes long-term legislation is eventually passed to permanently protect a small part of the U.S. population she believes is invaluable.</p>
      <p>"Its an incredible story of success integration, all Dreamers are employed or going to school and there isn't one story that isn't a success story, in whatever area of serving or school," said Milona.</p>
      <p>The protections remain in effect at least until the U.S. Supreme Court issues its decision, which will likely be in 2020. Participants of the program can renew their status, but no new applicants can sign up.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, the nation's highest court will hear oral arguments in the longstanding battle on whether to keep DACA or not.</p>
