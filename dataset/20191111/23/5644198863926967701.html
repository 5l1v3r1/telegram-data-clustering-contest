      <p>STOCKHOLM: A new collection from fashion giant H&amp;M has unleashed protests from women's rights campaigners because it includes the slogan "I love GBV", the initials of the designer but also a widely used acronym for gender-based violence.</p>
      <p>H&amp;M said the slogan, emblazoned on hats, a necklace and boxer shorts with a red heart symbolising the word "love", was an abbreviation of Italian designer Giambattista Valli and any other associations were unintentional.</p>

      <p>But women's rights activists demanded the products be withdrawn saying it was "crazy" to continue selling them.</p>
      <p>"This is not an obscure term. It's very commonly used as a short hand for gender-based violence," said Heather Barr, the women's rights division co-director at global advocacy group Human Rights Watch.</p>
      <p>The Swedish retailer launched the clothing line on Nov 7 in its first collaboration with Rome-born Valli, known in the fashion world for its ready-to-wear and haute couture pieces.</p>
      <p>"We condemn any type of violence, and as a value driven company, we believe in an inclusive and equal society," said H&amp;M spokesman Hacan Andersson in an email to the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
      <p>Gender-based violence affects one in three women worldwide according to the United Nations.</p>
      <p>A study by the UN last year found that the most dangerous place for women around the world may be at home and the number of those killed by a partner or relative was rising globally.</p>
      <p>The items that featured the tagline were still listed for sale on H&amp;M's website on Monday (Nov 11).</p>
      <p>"By coming up with this line in the first place it demonstrates the lack of awareness about women's rights," Pakistan-based Barr, who was among those who protested the tagline on Twitter, said by phone.</p>
      <p>"The right thing to do would have been to remove them all and apologise." </p>
