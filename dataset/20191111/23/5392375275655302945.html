      <p>During the last week, <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> took the wraps off the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 with a spectacular 108MP Penta-camera array. The device in question is the Global variant of the Chine Mi CC9 Pro. Among the specifications, the Mi Note 10 boasts a gorgeous 6.47-inch AMOLED curved display. Since its launch rumors are spreading pointing an LG or Samsung OLED panel for the Global markets. However, Xiaomi’s executive <a href="https://www.weibo.com/1569990961/IfyZi8XuU">has just revealed</a> that Visionox is the sole provider of Note 10’s screens.</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time that Xiaomi is partnering with Visionox. Both companies have a much more ambitious project – The Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha. Visionox has developed the wrap-solution for the Mix Alpha which results in the so-called 180% screen-to-body ratio. The display manufacturer is lead by the OLED team from Tsinghua University in Beijing, which is #16 in the QS World University Ranking for 2020, leapfrogging Yale and Columbia Universities.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, the OLED display in the Xiaomi Mi Note 10 is just the third for the company. The first was a foldable prototype, while the second is on the Mi Mix Alpha. For that reason, it’s safe to assume that Mi Note 10 screen is the company’s first display to arrive for the masses. The Mi Note 10 has just been released and time will tell how this display will perform against the competition. It can reach 430 nits of brightness, but according to Xiaomi, the numbers are elevated to 600 nits in strong light environments with Auto-Brightness enabled.</p>
