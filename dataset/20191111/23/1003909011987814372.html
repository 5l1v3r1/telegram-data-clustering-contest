      <h1>Hotel management giant Aimbridge finds Canadian home in Calgary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:36:04+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:36</time> by <a rel="author">David Parker, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Aimbridge Hospitality, based in Plano, Texas, and considered North America’s largest hotel management company is expanding into Canada — and has chosen Calgary as home to its Canadian headquarters.</p>
      <p>The company that currently owns and/or manages approximately 1,400 upscale, independent and branded hotels with more than 150,000 rooms across the U.S. and the Caribbean recently completed a merger with Interstate Hotels, the second largest hotel management company in North America. It has also finalized its acquisition of Calgary-based Bellstar Hotels &amp; Resorts, which adds 1,200 owners at condo resorts in Western Canada to the three Canadian properties it already manages; the Westin in Whistler, Sheraton Four Points in Surrey and Courtyard by Marriott in Prince George.</p>
      <p>Bellstar has made its mark over the past 10 years by driving profitability for independent resorts, acquiring an expertise and unique skill set that has made it the best offering of its kind in the country.</p>
      <p>Aimbridge’s interest in the Canadian market began after it acquired a REIT that managed the Westin Whistler. It hired Ian McAuley, a co-founder of Calgary-based Superior Lodging Corp., as its new Canadian president to play a key role in fostering new international joint venture opportunities while being responsible for identifying acquisitions, management and development activities for Aimbridge Hospitality’s Canadian portfolio.</p>
      <p>McAuley relocated to Toronto to be close to the major hotel players and, while working on his plans for Canadian expansion, had the good fortune to meet longtime Calgary businessman and Bellstar founder and CEO Dale Hodgson at an industry conference. Bellstar was featured on the front cover of Western Hotelier magazine at that time and the conversation quickly got around to Aimbridge’s need to establish a Canadian head office, and continued with an offer to purchase the company.</p>
      <p>McAuley knows this city well and figured it was best suited to attract talent, is tech/eCommerce focused, has office vacancies, and its location offers easy access to properties in Western Canada as well as to the company in Texas.</p>
      <p>With the acquisition, Aimbridge adds seven condo-hotel agreements and a head office with 18 staff. Those properties include Grande Rockies Resort and Solara Resort &amp; Spa in Canmore; Glacier Mountaineer Lodge, Kicking Horse Lodging and Palliser Lodge in Golden, B.C.; The Beach Club Resort in Parksville on Vancouver Island; and its latest property, The Royal Kelowna downtown hotel on Lake Okanagan in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>“The acquisition of this robust company and its thriving properties is a huge addition to our international portfolio,” says Dave Johnson, chair and CEO of Aimbridge, “and we look forward to ongoing success in the Canadian market.”</p>
      <p>It’s also great news for Calgary as Hodgson, now executive vice-president of development for Aimbridge Canada, and his executive team of Robin Cumine, vice-president of operations and corporate development, and Ian Thorley, vice-president of sales and marketing, are already looking for larger office space in the Beltline that will accommodate a doubling of staff here. The Calgary office will be divided into Aimbridge Hospitality and Bellstar Hotels &amp; Resorts.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to pass the torch to Aimbridge Hospitality, a company just as dedicated to innovation and revenue growth,” Hodgson says. “The robust infrastructure and proven managerial performance Aimbridge brings to the table bodes really well for our owners and guests going forward.”</p>
      <p>Notes:</p>
      <p>The board of directors of The United Farmers of Alberta Co-operative (UFA) has selected Scott Bolton as its new president and CEO following the departure of Carol Kitchen, who relocated to Illinois. Bolton takes on the role after serving as executive vice-president and CFO of UFA. Before joining the co-operative, he spent the bulk of his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he was a partner in charge of the Alberta consulting practice and national energy leader, and has a proven track record of success in the agriculture, oil and gas, and mining sectors. UFA is one of the largest agricultural co-operatives in the country with more than 120,000 member owners. Its network comprises more than 110 bulk fuel and cardlock petroleum locations, 34 farm and ranch supply stores, and a headquarters support office in Calgary.</p>
