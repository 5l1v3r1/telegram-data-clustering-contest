      <h1>Dougie Freedman and Graham Alexander want Hearts job as Neil Warnock makes decision</h1>
      <h2>The pair are in the running to succeed Craig Levein at Tynecastle as the club step up their search for a new manager.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:14:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:14</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Former Scotland internationals Dougie Freedman and Graham Alexander have emerged as candidates for the vacant <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> job.</p>
      <p>The pair are in the running to succeed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> at Tynecastle as legendary German manager Felix Magath and Billy Davies also threw their names into the ring.</p>
      <p>Freedman and Alexander are both currently in jobs but Jambos owner Ann Budge has been made aware of their interest in the Gorgie gig.</p>
      <p>Freedman was hot favourite when the job was last available after Ian Cathro was axed and was on a five-man shortlist before pulling out of the race after being named sporting director at Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old, who has had three stints as a boss at the Eagles, Bolton and Nottingham Forest, is still in that role at Selhurst Park but is keen to return to management.</p>

      <p>Fellow former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> star Alexander is another name in the frame with the 48-year-old currently in charge of English League Two side Salford City.</p>
      <p>Alexander previously managed Fleetwood and Scunthrope before taking over at the club backed by brothers Gary and Phil Neville and their Class of 92 Manchester United team-mates Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt.</p>
      <p>Budge, who has had more than 30 applications, is stepping up the hunt for a new boss this week with a new sporting director also in the pipeline.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> gaffer Stephen Robinson and caretaker Austin MacPhee, currently on international duty with Northern Ireland, remain the bookies’ favourites along with former St Mirren and Sunderland boss Jack Ross.</p>
      <p>And veteran coach Magath, 66, who won back-to-back Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich in 2005 and 2006, has applied for the job.</p>
      <p>Magath, who also led Wolfsburg to their only top flight success in 2009, is renowned for his punishing training methods and believes he is the man to drag the Jambos out of their current plight and back towards the European spots.</p>

      <p>While Magath is focused on the manager’s job, he has worked alongside sporting directors during his spells in his homeland.</p>
      <p>The veteran former West Germany midfielder was named German Manager of the Year in 2003, 2005 and 2009 and was most recently employed at Fulham and Shandong Luneng in China.</p>
      <p>Neil Warnock’s name was also mentioned in connection with the Tynecastle manager’s job after he left Cardiff last night but it’s understood the veteran boss, who is 71 next month, plans to retire.</p>
      <p>Former Preston, Derby and Nottingham Forest boss Davies is also in the hunt again which might come as a surprise after he pulled out of the running to succeed Cathro because the club wouldn’t change their structure.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said at the time: “I spoke to Hearts, looked at their structure and gave them a plan on how to alter it to improve the club.</p>
      <p>“It appears they are not ready to make the changes.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-naismith">Steven Naismith</a> insists the club are doing the smart thing by taking their time over the next manager.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s been a turbulent time and now is the time to step back and evaluate everything rather than rush into something.</p>
      <p>“Ann Budge will take her time to work out the best way forward for the club.”</p>
