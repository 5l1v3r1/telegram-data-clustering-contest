      <p>A thug who attacked a vulnerable woman and stole her backpack as she sat alone on a train has been jailed for 10 years.</p>
      <p>Aaron Foley, 32, was caught on CCTV repeatedly punching the victim before throwing her into a set of seats as she fought to hold on to her bag.</p>
      <p>The attack took place on a train travelling between Woolwich and Charlton in south-east London on June 3.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Inner London Crown Court heard that Foley had been begging on the train before approaching the woman.</p>
      <p>The CCTV footage shows Foley attempting to take the bag before launching a barrage of punches and at least one kick at his victim, leaving her bleeding from the mouth.</p>
      <p>The pair then struggle and she is thrown into a set of seats and to the floor several times.</p>

      <p>Jose Olivares-Chandler, prosecuting, said the woman had been willing to hand over money to Foley but refused to give him the bag because of its sentimental value.</p>
      <p>In an impact statement read to the court by Mr Olivares-Chandler, the victim said: "After this incident I no longer feel comfortable talking in public.</p>
      <p>"I have nightmares about the incident, it is a recurring nightmare. I think about it every day. Sometimes I wish I could have fought better. Why couldn't I fight him off?"</p>
      <p>The court heard that the woman had suffered multiple injuries to her face and required ongoing dental surgery.</p>
      <p>"I get upset when I brush my teeth, I am worried (Foley) has damaged my appearance permanently," she said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Olivares-Chandler added that the incident appeared to have taken place just three days after Foley was released from prison.</p>
      <p>Sentencing Foley, of Kingsman Street, Greenwich, Recorder Timothy Clark QC, said the attack had showed a "high degree of callousness".</p>
      <p>"(The victim) was sat on her own when she was approached by you, clearly begging. She makes it clear she is not interested. Your reaction is to punch her hard in the face. You punch her several times," he said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"This act left her, in my opinion, with serious facial injuries. She faces years of treatment."</p>
      <p>Mr Clark added that significant psychological harm had also been done and that Foley posed a serious risk of further offence.</p>
