      <h1>Raheem Sterling dropped by England after training bust-up with Joe Gomez</h1>
      <h2>The two Three Lions' stars had a heated exchange as Liverpool and Man City clashed in the Premier League just 24 hours before their England row</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:17:45+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:17</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> has been sensationally axed from England’s Euro 2020 qualifier with Montenegro after a remarkable bust-up with Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>England boss Gareth Southgate has taken the amazing step after players witnessed Sterling re-ignite a row which started at Anfield on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sterling is understood to have still been simmering after the title showdown and immediately continued the row when they reported up at St George’s Park on Monday.</p>
      <p>Gomez attempted to shake Sterling's hand from behind and witnesses said they heard him ask the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender whether he was “still the big man.”</p>
      <p>It is understood the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> star then went to grab his teammate before other members of the squad intervened.</p>
      <p>Gomez kept his cool and resisted getting involved but was left fuming by the row and was shocked that Sterling would react in such a way.</p>

      <p>It is understood that Sterling later apologised to his England team mate but it was not enough for Southgate who decided to take the extraordinary action.</p>
      <p>Sterling has since admitted that emotions got the better of him, and insisted that he and Gomez had moved on from the row.</p>
      <p>He also said he was fully behind the Three Lions for Thursday's qualifier against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Sterling will remain with the squad and could play against Kosovo but Southgate wanted to make a statement after the row which happened in a private team area at St George’s Park.</p>

      <p>Southgate said: “We have taken the decision to not consider Raheem for the match against Montenegro on Thursday. </p>
      <p>“One of the great challenges and strengths for us is that we’ve been able to separate club rivalries from the national team. Unfortunately the emotions of yesterday’s game were still raw.</p>
      <p>“My feeling is that the right thing for the team is the action we have taken. Now that the decision has been made with the agreement of the entire squad, it’s important that we support the players and focus on Thursday night.”</p>
      <p>It is believed Gomez was still angry after the row but Southgate will be hoping his action has defused the row.</p>
      <p>The pair had shaken hands and embraced after the row at the end of the game at Anfield and that is why Gomez was so shocked that Sterling started it again 24 hours later.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sterling has since taken to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to speak out about the row, saying he and Gomez have "figured things out and moved on".</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old posted: "First and foremost everyone knows what this game means to me!</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows that I am not that way inclined and more to the point, both Joe and I have had words and figured things out and moved on.</p>
      <p>"We are in a sport where emotions run high and I am man enough to admit when emotions get the better of me.</p>
      <p>"We move this is why we play this sport because of our love for it - me and @joegomez5 are good we both understand it was a 5-10 second thing it's done we move forward and not make this bigger than it is. Let's get focus on our game on Thursday."</p>
      <p>The Instagram post was liked by Gomez's Liverpool teammate Rhian Brewster among thousands of others.</p>
