      <h1>French Central Bank Job Posting Reveals Digital Currency Program</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T23:00:39+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan DiCamillo</a></address>
      <p>The central bank of France, Banque de France, is seeking a blockchain analyst who will help the bank define a program for implementing digital currency.</p>
      <p>In a job opening <a href="https://www.recrutement.banque-france.fr/detail-offre/analyste-blockchain-h-f-2068892/#">posted</a> on October 16th and listed under the Financial Stability and Operations branch of the bank, the bank called for an analyst with experience in crypto-economics, game theory and public or private blockchain. The bank is also <a href="https://www.recrutement.banque-france.fr/detail-offre/ingenieur-de-developpement-blockchain-h-f-2051058/">hiring</a> a development engineer to study the application of blockchain to key banking functions. Banque de France declined to comment.</p>
      <p>For the analyst position, the institution cited Quorum, Hyperledger and Corda as examples of private blockchain experience and the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains as examples of public blockchain experience.</p>
      <p>The bank also wants the analyst to experiment with other blockchain specialists in the eurosystem, participate in blockchain proof-of-concepts within and outside the bank and identify economic issues related to how monetary policy is conducted.</p>
      <p>Historically, Banque de France has been aggressively focused on blockchain and not bitcoin.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, the bank ran a digital identity trial that tested using blockchain in the management of identification markers used to establish the identity of creditors within the Single Euro Payments Area. A few months after that trial, the bank’s governor <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/france-central-bank-collaboration-blockchain">announced</a> that it would open a fintech innovation lab, which would include blockchain startups.</p>
      <p>Despite its interest in the technology underlying bitcoin, the bank <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/frances-central-bank-keep-financial-institutions-crypto">proposed</a> banning insurance companies, bank companies and trust companies from touching crypto-assets in March 2018.</p>
      <p>The bank’s position softened recently, however, with Denis Beau, a deputy governor of the bank, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/french-central-banker-the-world-needs-to-standardize-crypto-regulations">calling</a> for a global regulatory framework on crypto-assets earlier this year.</p>
