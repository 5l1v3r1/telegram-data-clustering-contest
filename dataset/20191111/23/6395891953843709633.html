      <p><b>BATON ROUGE, La.Â (AP)</b> - LSU coach Ed Orgeron says his boisterous and sometimes profane locker room speech after the top-ranked Tigers beat Alabama was not meant for public consumption and not meant to hurt anyone.</p>
      <p>An unidentified LSU player posted about 14 seconds of the speech on social media after Saturday night's 46-41 victory in Tuscaloosa. A rowdy Orgeron can be heard yelling that LSU is going to beat Alabama in recruiting and "every time they see us." Orgeron also uses an expletive to mock Alabama's "Roll Tide" rallying cry.</p>
      <p>"The things that I say outside, to the media, those are things I want to get out, and if I wanted that to get out, I would have said that outside," Orgeron said Monday when asked about the social media post. "You get emotional. You talk to your team - it's your family. Just like we all talk to our family.</p>
      <p>"We talk around the dinner table and say some things that outside the family we don't say. It was no means to hurt anybody - nothing like that. It was just a fiery moment, a very emotional moment. I think that's all that was."</p>
      <p>The social media post has been taken down and LSU declined to identify the player.</p>
      <p>Orgeron said he spoke to the player who broadcast that portion of the locker room celebration and that the player "felt bad."</p>
      <p>The victory gave unbeaten LSU (9-0, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) an inside track to the SEC championship game and potential College Football Playoff berth. The Tigers play next on Saturday night at Mississippi (4-6, 2-4) in a game nicknamed the Magnolia Bowl.</p>
