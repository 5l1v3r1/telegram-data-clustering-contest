      <p>Diaz recently spoke with <i>ESPN</i>’s Ariel Helwani in what was a lengthy, rambling interview and told the veteran reporter that Jorge Masvidal’s commemorative strap belongs to the Stockton star.</p>
      <p>“That’s my belt,” Diaz laughed when discussing the BMF belt. “But I’m not going to get in my brother’s way of taking it, you know what I mean? But as far as I’m concerned that’s my belt. I’m like, ‘you just fought my baby brother.”</p>
      <p>“The reason why I say that is because he ain’t got nothing to be mad about,” he said of his brother Nate Diaz. “He ain’t trippin’. Trust me. We never skipped a beat. I have ups and downs with everybody but never with my younger brother. You know what I mean? We don’t have that issue.”</p>

      <p>Nick has not competed professionally since a 2015 unanimous decision loss to Anderson Silva. The result was later overturned to a no contest after Silva tested positive for drostanolone and androsterone. Nick was also memorably and controversially suspended five years when he tested positive for marijuana, his third failure in the state of Nevada. That ban was eventually reduced to 18 months, but the former WEC and Strikeforce champion hasn’t been particularly close to making a UFC return.</p>
      <p>Nate is coming off of a third-round doctor stoppage loss to Masvidal at UFC 244.</p>
