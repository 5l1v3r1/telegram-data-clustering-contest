        <li>NRL player was facing two-year sentence for assault</li>
        <li>‘Peace settlement’ reached with alleged victim</li>
      </ul>
      <p>David Fifita says he’s “learnt a big lesson” after arriving back in Brisbane after three days in a Bali jail. The Brisbane <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nrl">NRL</a> star touched down early on Tuesday to be greeted by mother Gwen and club CEO Paul White before giving a short statement to the media.</p>
      <p>With Fifita facing more than two years in jail for assault, White confirmed the 19-year-old had to pay compensation out of his own pocket to reach a “peace settlement” with the complainant – a security guard he allegedly punched early on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Fifita was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/09/brisbane-broncos-star-david-fifita-arrested-in-bali-after-nightclub-brawl">arrested after the alleged incident</a>, forcing the club’s welfare officer Adam Walsh to fly to Bali to work with Fifita’s lawyers, Kuta police and the security guard to have the complaint dropped.</p>
      <p>“I’d like to thank everyone who has worked to help me get home,” Fifita said. “I’d like to thank Walshy, Payne [Haas, who he had travelled with] and my lawyers in Bali and everyone at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/brisbane-broncos">Brisbane Broncos</a>.</p>
      <p>“There has been a lot going on behind the scenes and I am really grateful for that. It’s a great feeling to be home to see my family. I’ve learnt a big lesson from what I’ve been through these last few days.”</p>
      <p>Confirming the club did not pay compensation to facilitate Fifita’s release, White said the teenager’s version of events would come out once the integrity unit interviewed him.</p>
      <p>“Any compensation that was paid was agreed upon David’s legal representative over there and David himself,” White said. “That is something between David and the alleged victim.</p>
      <p>“These peace agreements are part of these types of incidents, the settlement of these type of incidents, and they do involve an agreement between two parties. I look forward to the integrity unit being able to speak to Dave and take his version of events and make an independent judgement.”</p>
      <p>Fifita is entering the final year of his Brisbane contract and, attracting interest from a number of clubs, is expected to fetch offers in the region of $1m a season. Regardless, White conceded Fifita had made a poor decision putting himself in the party destination’s nightclub precinct in the early hours.</p>
      <p>“Nothing good happens after midnight,” White said. “You’re always disappointed; we work really hard with our players. David is a good young man and he’s going to learn a very big lesson from what he’s gone through over the last three days.”</p>
      <p>White said the club would allow the integrity unit to conduct its investigation and, while not ruling out a separate club sanction, indicated Fifita’s “harrowing” ordeal may be punishment enough.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know too many 19-year-old men ... of his background, who have had an experience like that,” he said. “I know, having a policing background, that being in a cell is not a great experience, and being in one in a foreign country was pretty confronting. He’ll learn a big lesson.”</p>
