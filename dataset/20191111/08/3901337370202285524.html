      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo once again reacted with frustration to being substituted on Sunday night, storming off the pitch and straight down the tunnel, with reports suggesting he even left the stadium before the game was finished. His coach has since discussed the situation.</p>

      <p>For a second game in a row, the Juventus superstar was taken off by manager Maurizio Sarri and did not take the withdrawal kindly against AC Milan on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>This time around, he went straight down the tunnel after Paulo Dybala, who scored the eventual winner, replaced him in the 55th minute with the game tied at 0-0.</p>

      <p>His coach, though, has once again downplayed the incident, saying Ronaldo's substitution was based on a minor injury problem.</p>
      <p>"I have no problem with Cristiano," Sarri said, as quoted by the <i>Daily Express</i>.</p>
      <p>"He should be thanked because he made himself available despite not being in the best condition.</p>
      <p>"In the last month, he has had discomfort in his knee and this is a little problem for him."</p>

      <p>Juventus picked up their 10th win of the Serie A 2019/20 campaign with their victory over Milan, going one point above Inter Milan, who also picked up three points on Saturday. The Bianconeri and Liverpool are now the only two unbeaten teams in Europe's top five leagues.</p>
