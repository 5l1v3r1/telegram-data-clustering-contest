      <h1>Govt gives sugar mills time till Dec 31 to export last year's balance quota</h1>
      <h2>This will be over and above the quota allocated for the ongoing 2019-20 marketing year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:20:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The government on Monday gave <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sugar-mills">sugar mills </a>three months more till December to export the last year's balance quota of the sweetener.</p>
      <p>Mills were able to export about 3.8 million tonne of sugar during the 2018-19 marketing year (October-September) due to depressed market conditions, against the target of 5 million tonne under the Minimum Indicative Export Quota (MIEQ) scheme.</p>
      <p>"Now, it has been decided by the central government to allow those sugar mills, which had partially exported their MIEQ of 2018-19 till September 2019, to export the balance quantity of their MIEQ by December 31, 2019," said a fresh notification issued by the food ministry.</p>
      <p>This will be over and above the quota allocated for the ongoing 2019-20 marketing year.</p>
      <p>A senior food ministry official said that much of the sugar during the last year was exported to the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.</p>
      <p>For the current year, the government has fixed an export quota of 6 million tonne under the MIEQ. Mills are hopeful that the quota will be fulfilled as the global market is facing 4 million tonnes of deficit.</p>
      <p>India has started the 2019-20 marketing year with an all-time high opening stock of 14.5 million tonne against a requirement of 3-5 million tonne.</p>
      <p>The government has pegged sugar output to decline to 28-29 million tonne for the current year from 33.1 million tonnes during 2018-19 due to sharp fall in cane acreage in Maharashtra and Karnataka.</p>
      <p>Whereas industry body ISMA has projected the country's output to touch a three-year low at 26 million tonne during 2019-20.</p>
      <p>There are 534 mills in the country. Mills in Uttar Pradesh have started the crushing operation, while it is delayed in Maharasthra and Karnataka.</p>
