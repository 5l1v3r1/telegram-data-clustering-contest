        <b>"Being that I am, it makes me appreciate life even more."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kevin Hart publicly addressed his fans for the first time since his shock car crash as he attended the People’s Choice Awards in Los Angeles last night.</p>
      <p>The US comedian was forced to undergo emergency back surgery after suffering three spinal fractures when <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/kevin-hart-suffers-major-back-injuries-in-car-accident-2544007">his car crashed into a ditch</a> in Malibu last September.</p>
      <p>While doctors believe that Hart’s recovery could take up to a year and he won’t return to work until 2020, he thanked fans in an emotional speech at the ceremony.</p>
      <p>Accepting the award for best Comedy Act of 2019 from Robert Downey Jr, Hart said: “First and foremost, thank God, because I definitely don’t have to be here.</p>

      <p>“Being that I am, it makes me appreciate life even more. It makes me appreciate the things that really matter… family. I want to thank my wife, my kids, who really stepped up to the plate for me.”</p>
      <p>“I truly want to thank you guys for being there for at my difficult time,” Hart told his fans.</p>
      <p>The actor had been in a vintage Plymouth Barracuda he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzqBmpnFamu/?utm_source=ig_embed">purchased for his 40th birthday</a> alongside two other people when the car veered off the highway and ended up about 10 feet off the road.</p>
      <p>He was in his car with 31-year-old Rebecca Broxterman and the pair were well enough to reach his home nearby for medical attention.</p>
      <p>However, the comedian and driver Jared Black, 28, both suffered major injuries and were later taken to hospital.</p>

      <p>“After my accident I see things differently, I see life from a whole new perspective. My appreciation for life is through the roof. I’m thankful for my family, my friends,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Don’t take today for granted, because tomorrow’s not promised. More importantly, I’m thankful for God, I’m thankful for life. I’m thankful for simply still being here.”</p>
