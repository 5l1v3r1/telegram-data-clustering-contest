      <p>A member of the Western Cape Hawks, Colonel Christelle Stemmet, 47, was shot dead at her home in Table View in Cape Town at around 20:00 on Sunday. </p>
      <p>According to Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Philani Nkwalase, Stemmet was shot twice and died on the scene.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Nuus/Misdaad/kolonel-van-valke-doodgeskiet-by-haar-huis-in-table-view-20191111">Netwerk24</a> reported that two spent bullet casings were found on the scene, but the murder weapon was not recovered. </p>
      <p>A friend of Stemmet's reportedly contacted the police following the shooting. </p>
      <p>A source close to the preliminary investigations told News24 that the shooting resulted from a family dispute.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Hawks issued a statement in which the unit conveyed its deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Stemmet. </p>
      <p>"The untimely passing of the our member, attached to Serious Corruption Investigation team, occurred [on Sunday] evening at her home in West Beach at Table View," the statement read. </p>
      <p>"It is alleged that two shots were fired and she was fatally wounded. The motive of the incident is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the local detectives; however, [a] preliminary investigation at this stage has ruled out any links to the Hawks' investigations that she was handling," said Nkwalase.</p>
      <p>"An inquest docket has been opened to explore circumstances surrounding the death of such a seasoned and dedicated officer."</p>
      <p>This is a developing story.</p>
