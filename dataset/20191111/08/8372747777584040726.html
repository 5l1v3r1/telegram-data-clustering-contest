      <p>Don your jackets and mittens, East Coasters. You're going to need them.</p>
      <p>The next five to seven days won't <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/16/health/cold-weather-health/index.html">just be cold </a>â€” they'll be record breaking.</p>
      <p>That's according to data from the National Weather Service, which predicts that more than 200 record lows could be tied or set from Monday to Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It's all part of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/07/us/arctic-blast-eastern-us-trnd/index.html">Arctic blast that's hitting the East Coast</a> , bringing below-freezing temperatures to some places. On Monday, temperatures are expected to plummet in the Great plains, before moving farther east on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Record low temperatures are possible across Texas, Oklahoma and parts of the Ohio Valley starting Tuesday morning. By Wednesday, more than a dozen record lows could be set in the Deep South and the Gulf Coast, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward.</p>
      <p>Some places in the East could experience temperatures on Wednesday afternoon that are up <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/us/arctic-blast-eastern-us-friday-trnd/index.html">to 30 degrees below average</a> .</p>
