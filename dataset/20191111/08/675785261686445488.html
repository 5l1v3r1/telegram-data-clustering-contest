      <h1>Roy Keane and Jose Mourinho in full agreement on how Liverpool's season will pan out</h1>
      <h2>Liverpool's 3-1 victory over champions Manchester City sees Jurgen Klopp's side move eight points clear of their title rivals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:58:28+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Roy Keane and Jose Mourinho agree that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will win the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>The two former managers waxed lyrical about Jurgen Klopp's Reds following Sunday's 3-1 victory over champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City.</a></p>
      <p>Keane told Sky Sports: "It's brilliant, it's where a manager plays it down, but we all know that this game doesn't need any build-up, it's a huge game with two fantastic teams.</p>
      <p>"When you look at the past 12 months, how consistent they have been, the points, the goals they've scored, clean sheets, the attacking players on show.</p>
      <p>"Jurgen's trying to play the game down but it will have a huge impact on who wins the league and I think City's mindset will be, and it has to be, to try and win the game, that's why he's been so successful.</p>

      <p>"You might have a different mindset with ten minutes to go if you're hanging in there, it depends on how the game pans out, but I think a draw wouldn't be a disaster for Liverpool, as they can keep that gap with Man City.</p>
      <p>"But again, Liverpool's mindset with their record over the last years at Anfield, they'll be going out to win the game."</p>

      <p>Mourinho was equally complimentary towards Liverpool, adding: "If you are behind [in the title race], you have to feel like you can reach them. If you are top of the league with a big advantage, you have to feel like it is not over.</p>
      <p>"But I am not there, I'm here. And here, from my position, I think it's done unless something dramatic happens in terms of an injury situation that breaks the team.</p>

      <p>"But I think the team is a complete puzzle. I feel the way they play is adapted to the qualities of the players.</p>
      <p>"City are capable of winning seven, eight, nine matches in a row, but I can't see how Liverpool can lose this advantage of nine points to them."</p>

      <p>Liverpool took the lead in the sixth minute through Fabinho before Mohamed Salah made it two before the half time break.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane added a third for the Reds with a close-ranger header before Bernardo Silva netted a late consolation. The win sees Liverpool move eight points ahead of City in the table.</p>
