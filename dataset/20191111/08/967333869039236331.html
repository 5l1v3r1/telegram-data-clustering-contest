      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910261077157755-miley-cyrus-says-you-dont-have-to-be-gay-as-there-are-good-people-with-dcks/">Singer and songwriter Miley Cyrus</a> is recovering after undergoing vocal cord surgery, according to PEOPLE.</p>
      <p>On 8 November, Cyrus’s boyfriend Cody Simpson appeared to make a reference to the surgery, as he shared a black-and-white photo of the pair with the caption “success”.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201910231077128941-miley-cyrus-nipples-instagram-rules/">“Mother’s Daughter” singer has already</a> been discharged from hospital, sources are said to have confirmed.</p>
      <p>In late October, Cyrus, 26, revealed via an Instagram Story that she had taken a hiatus from singing, writing, “On vocal rest not body”.</p>
      <p>The singer was reportedly hospitalised for one day for tonsillitis surgery.</p>

      <p>​According to sources, the singer was told at the time she would need to have surgery for a separate issue with her vocal cords, which she had unknowingly had for years, and that the recovery process would include several weeks of silence.</p>
      <p>As a result of the issue, Cyrus, who had been working on new music, was forced to put recording and performing on hold.</p>

      <h3>Miley and Cody 'On the Same Page'</h3>
      <p>Miley Cyrus  released her latest EP "She Is Coming" in June, the first of three six-song EPs the singer said would assemble a full LP titled "She Is Miley Cyrus".</p>
      <p>While Miley Cyrus is taking a break from her vocals, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201910051076971397-miley-cyrus-responds-to-slut-shaming-after-kiss-with-cody-simpson/">Cody Simpson released</a> a new song last month titled “Golden Thing,” which apparently is inspired by Cyrus.</p>
      <p>The Australian singer, 22, who has been by Cyrus’ side throughout her recovery process, recently revealed that the pair, who have been friends for years, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201909231076865193-miley-cyrus-kaitlynn-carter-break-up-after-month-long-romance/">came together</a> over their shared sobriety.</p>
      <p>“We keep each other in a good place. That’s what’s really healthy about it and I think that’s the first time I’ve had that in a relationship. We’re very, very much on the same page," Simpson said on The Kyle and Jackie O Show last month.</p>
