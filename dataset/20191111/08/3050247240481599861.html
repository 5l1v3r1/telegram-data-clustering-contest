      <h1>Argentina Sets New Trading Record After Central Bank Bans Bitcoin Buys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:30:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) trading set new records in two of its most keenly watched South American markets last week, new data has revealed.</p>
      <p>As monitoring resource Coin Dance confirmed on Nov. 10, the seven days ending Saturday saw more trading against BTC than ever before in both <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/venezuela">Venezuela</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/argentina">Argentina</a>. </p>
      <h3>Argentina: central bank accidentally increases Bitcoin popularity</h3>

      </p>
      <p>The statistics cover peer-to-peer platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/localbitcoins">Localbitcoins</a>, which despite increasing user identification demands continues to see patronage in the two troubled economies.</p>
      <p>In total, Venezuela traded 142.9 billion sovereign bolivars (VES) last week, while Argentina managed 19.4 million pesos (ARS). Both are firm records over previous levels.</p>
      <p>In Bitcoin terms, however, the trading period did not see a noticeable uptick in volume, proof that both countries’ currencies are continuing to weaken. Venezuela traded 627 BTC ($5.5 million), while Argentina’s tally totaled 30 BTC ($263,000).</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-trading-spikes-as-argentina-bans-buying-more-than-200-a-month">reported</a>, inflation continues to be a major problem for the governments in both Caracas and Buenos Aires, with Argentina’s change of government only serving to make matters worse for the economy. </p>
      <p>Last week, the central bank <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/argentinas-central-bank-bans-bitcoin-purchases-with-credit-cards">formally banned</a> consumers from purchasing Bitcoin and other <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrency</a> using credit cards.</p>
      <h3>Petro “everything Bitcoin stands against”</h3>
      <p>Venezuelans meanwhile continue to hit out at their regime’s state-backed cryptocurrency <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/petro">Petro</a>, introduced on a semi-mandatory basis last year. </p>
      <p>“Printing physical worthless money is expensive and has challenging logistics. This is why Venezuela is going ‘Petro’ — to screw the people out their savings in real-time, with no printing costs at all,” <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptonomista/status/1192473897200959491">Mauricio Di Bartolomeo</a>, co-founder of Bitcoin finance startup Ledn, summarized about the situation on Nov. 7. He added: </p>
      <blockquote>“The Venezuelan Petro is everything Bitcoin stands against.”</blockquote>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/700641ec-fc28-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">Financial Times</a> on Sunday, Venezuela is being forced to sell cheap blends of oil at a significant discount due to the mounting impact of United States’ sanctions on the government.</p>
      <p>Oil revenues are now down to just $250 million per month, compared with up to $5 billion prior to the financial crisis.</p>
