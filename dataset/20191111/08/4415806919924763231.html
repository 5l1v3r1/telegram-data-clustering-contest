      <h1>Irish women 'working for free for rest of year due to gender pay gap'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:53:00+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Irish women will effectively be working for free for the remainder of the year because of the gender pay gap, according to Dublin-based charity Dress for Success Dublin (DfSD).</p>
      <p>The charity founded by fashion supremo Sonya Lennon says women in Ireland are paid an average of 13.9% less than men. On this basis, women are effectively "working for free" from now until the end of the year, while men continue to be paid in full.</p>
      <p>"We have a gender pay gap in Ireland of 13.9%. If you shave 13.9% off the end of the year, you land on today's date," Sonya Lennon, founder of DfSD, said.</p>
      <p>"Lack of affordable childcare, gender stereotyping, inflexible work options and poor take-up of parental leave are all feeding into the persistent inequalities between women and men," she added.</p>
      <p>Today marks 'Equal Pay Day' here, which aims to highlight the pay gap between women and men.</p>
      <p>The European Institute for Gender Equality's (EIGE) Gender Equality Index shows that women's mean monthly earnings are €2,808 in Ireland, compared to €3,423 for men.</p>
      <p>However, Irish Examiner columnist Victoria White says the issue arises for obvious reasons.</p>
      <p>"This (13.9%) is kind of a bogus figure (that) focuses on a narrow set of parameters," she said.</p>
      <p>"There is apparently a very, very small actual pay gap, but most of the gender pay gap is becuase women take a step back from work more than men do, in the course of their working lives."</p>
