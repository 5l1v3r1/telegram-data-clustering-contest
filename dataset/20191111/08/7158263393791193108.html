      <p>Netflix’s new original movie stars Ali Wong and Randall Park as long-lost childhood sweethearts who reunite as adults and obviously fall back in love. Sigh. Oh, and it also features Keanu Reeves as…Keanu Reeves. Here for it.</p>

      <p>Taraji P. Henson chugs a random liquid given to her by a psychic and can suddenly hear all men’s thoughts everywhere. That’s actually my worst nightmare, but this film isn’t. It’s got everything you need: a strong female lead, a brutal takedown of a male-dominated workplace, and a good love story.</p>

      <p>This film is literally based on Harry Styles fan fiction, and we are LIVING for it. Basically, it’s a girl-meets-bad-boy, falls-in-love-and-tries-to-change-him story. You know the drill.</p>

      <p>Another Netflix original, <i>The Last Summer</i> is about a group of high school students during their final summer before college. KJ Apa innocently chases after <i>Good Trouble</i>’s Maia Mitchell, and Tyler Posey plays a not-so-innocent baseball (and real-life) player.</p>

      <p>Noah Centineo plays an (unrealistically) unpopular high school boy who starts a dating service in order to save up for college. A foolproof plan...until he falls for the girl who inspired his business. Rookie mistake.</p>

      <p>Imagine this. You’re a struggling musician who wakes up one day to find out you’re the only one who remembers The Beatles. You’d totally take advantage, right? That’s <i>Yesterday</i>, and there’s some romance in there too.</p>
      <h3>16. Isn’t It Romantic</h3>

      <p>This movie is equal parts Liam Hemsworth fantasy come to life and a lesson about being too cynical. Rebel Wilson’s character wakes up in an alternate universe where she’s the star of her own IRL rom-com.</p>
      <h3>17. Last Christmas</h3>

      <p>Emilia Clarke + Henry Golding + Christmas = probably the best movie you’ll see this calendar year. Emilia plays Kate, who falls in love with Henry’s Tom even though she has some serious emotional guards up.</p>

      <p>Greta Gerwig’s much-anticipated rendition of Louisa May Alcott’s beloved classic follows the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) from girlhood into womanhood in post–Civil War America. The cast is, honestly, ridiculous: Emma Watson, Saoirse Ronan, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern, and internet BF Timothée Chalamet, among others. And, okay, it’s not a *traditional* love story, but it’s so full of love and light that we’re just gonna go ahead and count it as a capital “R” Romance. Bye!<br/><b>Release date: December 25<br/><br/></b>Related Story</p>
