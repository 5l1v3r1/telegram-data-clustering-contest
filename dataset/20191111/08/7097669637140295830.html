      <h1>Longtime Republican Rep. Pete King won't seek reelection</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:03:59+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Watson</a></address>
      <p>Fourteen-term New York Republican Rep. Pete King won't seek reelection, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/petekingforcongress/?__tn__=%2Cd%2CP-R&amp;eid=ARA-YdLMv0c_T0JYZ9c80uLa5i0pTZ7RTa0R9Een_FpMGfby1iSYHAP3mbcfAy1VKzsh8mR4hoGSXD_g?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">he announced Monday in an early-morning Facebook post</a>. King joins a growing number of Republicans and a handful of Democrats who plan to leave after next year.</p>
      <p>King, 75, has served in Congress since 2003. He cited his family as the reason for returning to Long Island full time. </p>
      <p>"The prime reason for my decision was that after 28 years of spending 4 days a week in Washington, D.C., it is time to end the weekly commute and be home in Seaford," King wrote. "This was not an easy decision."</p>
      <p>The Long Island representative was a Republican in a more moderate mold than many of his colleagues, the first Republican for instance, to sign onto an automatic weapons ban, which ultimately failed, earlier this year. </p>
      <p>"It's been a great run! Thanks," King wrote in concluding his announcement. </p>
      <p>King's district is heavily Republican, easily voting for President Trump over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But his departure is sure to trigger a competitive race for his replacement next year. </p>
      <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, said he will miss King on Capitol Hill. </p>
      <p>"Peter King stood head &amp; shoulders above everyone else He's been principled &amp; never let others push him away from his principles," <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1193873613746778114?ftag=YHF4eb9d17">Schumer tweeted</a>. "He's fiercely loved America, Long Island, and his Irish heritage and left a lasting mark on all 3 I. will miss him in Congress &amp; value his friendship."</p>
