      <h1>Priyanka Chopra Jonas’s pretty selfie gets a cute response from Nick Jonas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:56:54+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author">TNN</a></address>
      <p>Their first wedding anniversary is just around the corner and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Priyanka-Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> Jonas and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nick-Jonas">Nick Jonas</a> continue to give us couple goals. The couple, who tied the knot on December 1 last year, are active on social media and regularly post pictures. PeeCee, who was last seen on the big screen in Shonali Bose’s ‘The Sky Is Pink’ also starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Farhan-Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>, Rohit Saraf and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Zaira-Wasim">Zaira Wasim</a>, is currently shooting in India. And with her better half all the way back in USA, it’s natural for the couple to miss each other. Priyanka, who posted a pretty selfie of herself on Instagram, was quickly inundated with comments and the one, which stood out, was from Nick, so wrote, ‘So beautiful’.</p>
      <p>In the picture, PeeCee is wearing an aquamarine top and simple hoop earrings with minimal make-up. She captioned the picture, ‘The wound is the place where the Light enters you.” – Rumi #setlife #musings.’</p>

      <p>Apart from her work commitments, the actress is also spending quality time with family. She also shared a picture of some of her relatives where she is seen wearing a black shirt and skirt with knee-high boots. In a recent interview, Nick was asked what special plans he had for their first anniversary, but refused to divulge any details because he wanted to surprise his wife.</p>
