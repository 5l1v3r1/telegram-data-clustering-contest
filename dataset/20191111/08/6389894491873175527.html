      <p>Dignity, the UK’s only listed funeral firm, saw its underlying operating profit slip 30 per cent for the year to date, driven by a significantly lower number of deaths.</p>
      <p>Profit fell from £68.6m in 2018 to £47.9m this year. Underlying revenue also fell eight per cent, from 244.2m in 2018 to 225.4m.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Compared to the same period last year, 432,000 people died in the 39 weeks up to the end of September, down from 455,000 in 2018.</p>
      <p>The UK is set for its lowest year of deaths since 2014, with a total number of 577,000, 3.7 per cent lower than in 2018.</p>
      <p>The group’s performance was in line with company expectations, and was bolstered by a market share of 11.9 per cent.</p>
      <p>Mike McCollum, the group’s chief executive, said: “I am pleased with the group’s progress so far this year. </p>
      <p>“Although deaths are lower, market share remains robust, the transformation plan remains on track and our journey to build a more modern technologically enabled business that offers clients a high-quality service at a variety of price points remains firmly intact.”</p>
      <p>The group’s outlook remains unchanged from its previous results, but will be heavily dependent on the number of deaths. </p>
      <p>In March, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said they would launch an enquiry into the funeral sector due to fears over increased pricing.</p>
      <p>The cost of the average funeral has risen 6 per cent a year for the past 14 years, a rate double that of inflation. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The CMA said it was concerned that people in vulnerable circumstances could find themselves under pressure. </p>
      <p>Dignity’s share price fell over 2 per cent in early trading, to 516.5p. </p>
