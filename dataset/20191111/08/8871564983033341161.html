      <h1>98 Degrees to bring ’90s boy band heat to Singapore in February</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-11T08:21:14+00:00">11 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>From the late nineties and early noughties comes Pop-R&amp;B boy band 98 Degrees to play Singapore for the first time next year, promoter LAMC Productions announced today.</p>
      <p>Famous for hits including <i>Give Me Just One Night</i>, <i>Thank God I Found You</i>, as well as the wedding anthem <i>I Do; </i>Jeff Timmons, Justin Jeffre and brothers Nick and Drew Lachey are on their way to the Lion City in February, nearly 20 years after they decided to “take a break,” to steal hearts with their famous ballads. </p>
      <p>The American quartet peaked from 1997 to 2002, around the time other popular boy bands such as NSYNC and Backstreet Boys were being idolized around the world by teenyboppers. </p>
      <p>The group sold 10 million records within five years and collaborated with the likes of Mariah Carey before deciding to go on what proved a very long hiatus following the devastating 9/11 attack in New York. </p>
      <p>During their break, each member went on to pursue solo careers (remember Nick Lachey’s reality show with ex-wife and popstar Jessica Simpson?) before finally getting back together in 2016 to tour the US with other pop groups O-Town and Dream, as well as noughties singer Ryan Cabrera.</p>
      <p>The group eventually put out its first album in 18 years in 2017 with the Christmastime release <i>Let It Snow.</i></p>
      <p>Advanced tickets to <i>An Evening With 98 Degrees</i> range from S$108 to S$169 and <a href="https://www.sistic.com.sg/">go on sale Nov. 18 at SISTIC</a>.  Standard tickets – S$128 to S$188 – go on sale the next day.</p>
