      <p>Boris Johnson has pledged to change the law to protect Armed Forces veterans from vexatious legal action, as the British General Election campaign enters its second week.</p>
      <p>The Tories want to end "unfair" trials of veterans where no new evidence has been produced and the accusations have been questioned exhaustively in court.</p>
      <p>If they win a majority at the election, the party will amend the Human Rights Act so it does not apply to incidents – including deaths during the Troubles – which took place before the law came into force in 2000.</p>
      <p>The pledge is among a package of measures the party is proposing to support British military personnel, veterans and their families.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson said a Tory government would “always support” the Armed Forces.</p>
      <p>He said: “As we remember the ultimate sacrifice made by our brave men and women for their country just over a century ago, it is right that we renew our commitment to the soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and veterans of today.”</p>
      <p>The Conservative pledge includes measures to guarantee veterans job interviews for public sector roles, provide Ministry of Defence funded “wraparound” childcare, and tax relief for companies which hire veterans in the first year after they have left service.</p>
