      <h1>Amazon is selling a heated blanket for your car to help motorists stay warm this winter</h1>
      <h2>The handy electrically-heated throw plugs into your car's cigarette lighter and provides three levels of warmth</h2>

      <p>Winter is coming.</p>
      <p>We don’t need weather forecasters to tell us that, the sharp drop in temperatures, wet and windy conditions and the extra layers are enough of a clue for everyone.</p>
      <p>And it’s also the time for motorists to start planning ahead to worsening conditions and the potential for delayed journeys.</p>
      <p>Despite the best efforts of gritters up and down the land, Scottish weather is unpredictable and every year we read about delayed journeys and motorists getting stranded.</p>
      <p>So it comes as no surprise to find that <a href="https://amzn.to/34Q19A8">Amazon</a> is selling heated blankets made specifically for your car  to make winter travel a bit more comfortable.</p>

      <p>The blanket is designed specifically for your car - the cord plugs directly into the cigarette lighter instead of a traditional outlet.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/34Q19A8">Sojoy Auto's electric car blanket</a> costs between £29.99 and £39.99, includes free delivery and comes with an eight-foot cord making it comfortable and easy for backseat passengers to snuggle up on long road trips.</p>

      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2q0DeiC">Amazon</a> states the blanket works in any car, truck or RV that has a cigarette lighter and starts warming up as soon as you plug it in.</p>
      <p>And the fleece material keeps the blanket warm long after you unplug it, making it perfect for outdoor events in the colder months.</p>
