      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-strokes">The Strokes</a> drummer Fabrizio Moretti has teamed up with Italian art dealer Fabrizio Moretti (yes, that’s correct), for a new art exhibition at Sotheby’s in New York.</p>
      <p>The auction house will host ‘In Passing’ from December 15 to 18, before auctioning off the artwork on the last day. Art dealer Moretti will host a selection of 20 Old Master paintings and sculptures ranging from the 14th to 18th Centuries, while Strokes drummer Moretti will provide a selection of immersive installations.</p>
      <p>Moretti (the art dealer), commented: “What unites [these artists] is their mastery over their craft and their exploration of the universal themes of the human condition. I was intrigued to collaborate with another Fabrizio who shares my name, a man who is both a respected visual artist and musician who excels across disciplines, much like the artists featured in the exhibition, and to re-discover these themes with him.”</p>

      <p>Sotheby’s Brahm Wachter said: “It has been incredibly exciting for my colleague Yasemin Ozuye and I to work on this collaboration with the two Fabrizio Morettis, each a powerful force in their respective fields. The collaboration speaks to the larger effort by Sotheby’s to attract new and younger clientele by presenting Old Masters in fresh and interesting ways.”</p>
      <p>In other news, Strokes guitarist Nick Valensi recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-strokes-new-album-is-finished-guitarist-nick-valensi-teases-2545933">teased that their anticipated comeback album is finished.</a></p>
      <p>Valensi was interviewed on <i>Out of the Box</i> when the host claimed to have inside information that the album was complete and currently at the mixing stage. “Wow, you heard that?” Valensi replied. “Who told you that?”</p>
      <p>With the host stating that the info came from a “reliable source”, the musician said: “Well, it must be true then.” Pressed on “when” or “if” we’ll hear the record, Valensi responded: “When, I don’t know. If – I would say, a strong likelihood.”</p>
      <p>The Strokes will also head back to <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/lollapalooza-south-america-2020-line-up-the-strokes-guns-n-roses-travis-scott-2556126">South America next year to headline Lollapalooza.</a></p>
