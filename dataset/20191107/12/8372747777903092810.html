      <p>The Leapfrog Group announced its fall 2019 hospital safety grades.</p>
      <p>Cape Coral, Lee Memorial, Gulf Coast Medical Center, and Healthpark Medical Center received 'A' grades.</p>
      <p>Hospital safety grades focus on how hospitals protect patients from errors, accidents, and hospital-related injuries.</p>
      <p>Not all hospitals in our area did well, however.</p>
      <p>Fawcett Memorial and Bayfront Health in Port Charlotte and Punta Gorda received 'C' grades.</p>
      <p>Both Collier County Hospitals NCH Naples and NCH Baker received a 'D' grade.</p>
      <p>NCH filed a lawsuit against Leapfrog over the grades they received.</p>
      <p>The health group announced that lawsuit earlier this week.</p>
      <p>NCH says the group's grade is inaccurate.</p>
      <p>The Leapfrog Group released a statement in response to the lawsuit;</p>
      <blockquote>Naples residents should be very concerned when their hospital system wastes money on a frivolous lawsuit disputing the free speech rights of an independent nonprofit organization.</blockquote>
      <p>Leah Binder, Leapfrog President and CEO.</p>
