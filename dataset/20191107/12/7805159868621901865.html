      <h1>Google quietly rolls out the ramping ringer feature for Pixel smartphones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:50:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mishaalrahman/" target="_blank">Mishaal Rahman</a></address>
      <p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-android-q-rules-ramping-ringer-now-playing-album-art/">we spotted</a> a new feature in-development dubbed “Ramping Ringer.” When enabled, incoming call notifications will vibrate the phone for 5 seconds before gradually ramping up the ringtone volume over a period of 10 seconds. Since we first spotted this feature, the stable Android 10 update was released for Pixel smartphones and the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel">Google Pixel</a> 4 launched with this feature nowhere in sight. Today, however, we spotted the feature going live on multiple Pixel 4 units as well as the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-pixel-3/">Pixel 3</a>.</p>
      <p>You can access the feature by going to Settings &gt; Sound and then tapping on “Vibrate for calls.” This opens a subsetting page where you can set the phone to never vibrate, always vibrate, or vibrate first then ring gradually. Previously, “Vibrate for calls” was just a toggle with no third option for gradually increasing the ringtone volume.</p>

      <p>I confirmed the presence of this new setting on my own Pixel 4 unit, but I’ve also spoken to 4 owners of the Pixel 4 XL who confirmed the setting is present. This feature seems to be going live for many, unlike the new “Rules” feature that <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-10-rules-automation-feature-rolls-out-some-pixel-devices/">only went live for a handful of people</a>. We’ll keep an eye out to see if this feature is coming to all Pixel devices. So far I don’t see it on my not-fully-updated <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-pixel-3/">Pixel 3 XL</a>, but XDA’s Joe Fedewa says he has the option on his Pixel 3.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p><i>Update 1: </i>A user with the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2-xl">Pixel 2 XL</a> confirms they see the new option on their device.</p>
      <p><i>Update 2: </i>Two users with the original Pixel report seeing this new option.</p>
