        <b>Sweden's Migration Agency reached a decision in 4,834 work permit cases during October. Here's an in-depth look at how many permits were granted, and to whom.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A total of 4,367 work permit applications were sent to Sweden's Migration Agency last month and 4,834 people received a decision. Of those, 3,602 permits were approved.</p>
      <p>In 821 of the approved cases, the applicant was moving to Sweden to work for a certified employer, a group of companies that have already proved to the Migration Agency that they meet certain criteria (including a recurring need for non-EU hires and proof that they have fulfilled legal requirements in previous work permit cases) and for whom processing takes a maximum of 20 days.</p>
      <p>So who did the work permits go to?</p>
      <p>Most of them were given to family members of workers (1,667), followed by people coming to Sweden to work as employees of a Swedish company (1,539). Family members, including spouses or registered partners, are typically included on a partner's work permit if they will also move to Sweden. If the main applicant has a job offer of over six months, their partner is also eligible for a work permit.</p>
      <p>Thirteen permits were handed to self-employed applicants, 98 to guest researchers and 285 to "others".</p>
