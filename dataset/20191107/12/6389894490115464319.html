      <p>Housebuilder Persimmon today blamed a drop in first half sales volumes on the implementation of a new customer care improvement plan. </p>
      <p>Under the plans Persimmon has restricted the release of new homes for sale until construction has reached a more advanced stage, meaning sales declined six per cent year on year to 7,584 homes.</p>

      <p>The move also led to five per cent lower average active sales outlets year on year at about 350 sites. </p>
      <p>The developer said it anticipated the trend will continue into the second half of the year, although sales are expected to be higher due to a seasonal spike.</p>
      <p>Persimmon said consumer confidence has remained resilient despite the uncertainties surrounding Brexit due to strong levels of employment, low interest rates and a competitive mortgage market. </p>
      <p>Average weekly private sales reservation per site was 0.67, in line with last year, and forward sales dipped slightly compared to last year from £987m to £950m. </p>
      <p>“I am confident that the continued successful implementation of our detailed customer care improvement plans together with our strengthened forward build position, healthy forward sales, robust balance sheet and industry-leading land holdings provide a sound platform for the successful future development of the group,” chief executive Dave Jenkinson said. </p>

      <p>David O’Brien, equity analyst at investment bank Goodbody, said Persimmon had reported “solid results”.</p>
      <p>“Overall, this is a comforting statement and the housebuilder continues to offer an attractive risk return profile,” he said.</p>
