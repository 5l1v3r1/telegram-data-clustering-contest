      <h3>PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte is eyeing to ban the use of plastics in the Philippines, Malacañang said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said Duterte broached the idea during the 43rd Cabinet meeting in Malacañang Wednesday night after the issue on climate change was raised.</p>
      <p>Panelo said Vernice Victorio, President and CEO of the Natural Resources Development Corp., “shared with the Cabinet the Priority Programs for Environment and Climate Change Resiliency.”</p>
      <p>“During her presentation, the President floated the idea to ban the use of plastics, which according to him would require legislative action,” he said.</p>
      <p>Several bills on banning the use of plastics remain pending in Congress.</p>
      <p>Sen. Francis Pangilinan has filed Senate Bill 40 which seeks a ban on the importation, manufacture and use of all single-use plastics.</p>
      <p>Pangilinan proposed that those who violate this would be penalized and those who re-use and recycle would receive incentives.</p>
      <p>Sen Cynthia Villar also filed Senate Bill No. 333 or the Single-Use Plastic Product Regulation Act of 2019.</p>
      <p>Under her proposed bill, the issuance of the single-use plastics by food establishments, markets and retailers would be prohibited.</p>
