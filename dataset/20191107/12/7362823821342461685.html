      <p>"As an attorney for almost 30 years and looking at what the president has done for our world and the rule of law is truly remarkable," she told the "Friends" hosts. "And the president made promises, and he's keeping those promises and that was at the top of his list. Not only that, our jobs, our economy, all the other incredible things that he's done and doing -- he will continue to do [things] for our country, despite being under siege by the left."</p>
