      <h1>Smog: Scores of Indian farmers arrested over polluting fires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:04:36+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>NEW DELHI: </b>More than 80 farmers have been arrested in northern India for starting fires that contributed to the recent pollution crisis in New Delhi and other cities, officials said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Each winter the post-harvest burning of crop stubble covers swaths of the region in toxic smog, which combines with car and factory emissions to turn Delhi into the world’s most polluted capital.</p>
      <p>India’s top court this week ordered a crackdown on illegal stubble-burning, but the fires continued across Punjab and Haryana states – with many started at night to try and avoid detection.</p>

      <p>An Indian senior Punjab police officer said more than 17,000 farm fires had been reported in the state in the past three days, with 4,741 on Wednesday alone.</p>
      <p>“More than 84 people have been arrested for violating the law. Cases have been filed against 174 farmers,” the officer told <i>AFP</i>.</p>
      <p>Punjab and Haryana make up a key agricultural region that produces nearly 18 million tonnes of rice each year. This, in turn, creates nearly 20 million tonnes of crop stubble – most of which is burnt.</p>
      <p>Authorities said more than 48,000 farm fires had been reported in the two states since late September – a dramatic increase from 30,000 cases in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court ordered a complete stop to the fires on Monday and on Wednesday slammed local governments for not taking action, instructing them to pay hard-up farmers to stop burning the stubble.</p>
      <p>“You just want to sit in your ivory towers and rule. You are not bothered and are letting the people die,” said Justice Arun Mishra.</p>
      <p>Pollution levels in the Indian capital remained bad on Thursday, four days after one of its worst pollution attacks in several years during which schools were closed and a public health emergency declared.</p>
      <p>Dirty air causes hundreds of thousands of premature deaths in Indian cities each year, according to medical studies.</p>
      <p>Tiny particles from the fires, which can enter the bloodstream and penetrate the lungs and heart, get blown over New Delhi.</p>
      <p>In the winter, cooler temperatures prevent pollutants from dispersing, while smoke from millions of Diwali firecrackers also help turn the capital’s skies a putrid yellow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Pakistan, air pollution forced the closure of thousands of schools in Lahore, with a local environment agency spokesperson blaming the poisonous haze on crop-burning in India.</p>
      <p>Lahore, home to at least six million people, is less than an hour from the Indian border</p>

      <p>However Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar said similar burning takes place in Pakistan, and his administration is tackling the problem.</p>
      <p>“Administration is already on high alert and have tasked them to escalate actions against crop burning and other factors that contribute to smog,” he said.</p>
      <p>Twitter user Ammar Ali Jan wrote that the city was unbearable.</p>
      <p>“The smog is impossible to escape. We destroyed our water resources. Now our air is hazardous. We have turned elements of life into vehicles of death,” said Jan.</p>
