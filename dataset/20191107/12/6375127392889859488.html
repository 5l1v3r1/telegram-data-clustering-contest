      <h1>Spanish film ban urged</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:05:45+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/efren-montano" target="_blank">Efren Montano</a></address>
      <h3>THE Movie Television Review Classification Board (MTRCB) will decide whether to ban the Spanish-produced animated film “Elcano and Magellan” in the Philippines, Malacañang said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Since the release of the movie’s poster, several Filipino netizens have reacted adversely to the film, taking offense that it depicts colonizers in a good light, while portraying Filipino natives, including hero Lapu-Lapu, negatively.</p>
      <p>“We will not want to preempt the jurisdiction of that agency,” Presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo said.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the movie is set to be released in Philippine cinemas in January 2020.</p>
      <p>A movie poster of a Spanish production of an animated movie entitled “Elcano and Magellan: The First Voyage Around the World” depicts an animation of Lapu-Lapu with the subhead “with Philippines very own hero Lapu-Lapu.”</p>
      <p>The top left of the poster mentions a special highlight featuring the Battle of Mactan between Magellan and Lapu-Lapu.</p>
      <p>Based on the trailer, the animation promises “a great adventure that will change the course of human history.”</p>
      <p>But netizens are quick to point out that in these modern times, it is wrong to depict colonizers as heroes.</p>
