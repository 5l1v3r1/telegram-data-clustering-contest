      <p>JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A consortium composed of Madagascar’s Axian Group and Africa-focused private equity firm Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) will acquire a 51% stake in Togo’s state telecommunications company, Togocom, the government said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The West African government’s acceptance of the bid by the Agou Holding consortium marks the completion of a privatization process announced last year. The deal leaves Togocom - the holding company for Togo Telecom and mobile network operator Togocel - with an enterprise value of over 210 billion CFA francs ($353 million).</p>
      <p>Agou Holding plans to invest 245 million euros ($271 million) in the company over the next seven years to improve international connectivity and expand Togocom’s high-speed fiber and mobile networks, the government said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This major operation marks a crucial step in the government’s digital roadmap,” Cina Lawson, Minister of Post, the Digital Economy and Technological Innovation, said.</p>
      <p>Based in Madagascar, Axian owns Telma, a telecom firm operating in the Indian Ocean Madagascar, Comoros, Reunion Island and Mayotte, and is present in Senegal through its operator Free Senegal, formerly Tigo.</p>
      <p>ECP has previously invested in telecommunications companies including MTN Côte d’Ivoire, Orascom Telecom Algeria, Airtel, Wananchi and IHS Towers.</p>
      <p>In addition to Togocel, Moov Togo, a local subsidiary of Etisalat (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ETISALAT.AD">ETISALAT.AD</a>), also operates a mobile network in Togo.</p>
