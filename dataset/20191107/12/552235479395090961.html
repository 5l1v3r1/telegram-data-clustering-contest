      <h1>West Lothian lad seals bronze medal at European Taekwon-do Championships</h1>
      <h2>Connor Stuart, from Murieston, called the experience 'absolutely jaw-dropping'.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:03:16+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author">Callum Carson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/callum-carson/</a></address>
      <p>A 16-year-old from Murieston is targeting future success after clinching a bronze medal at the European Taekwond-do Championships in Sarajevo.</p>
      <p>Connor Stuart, a member of Scotia Taekwon-do-UK Scotland, grabbed third place in the 50.1-56kg male junior category and paid tribute to his instructor David Condie for helping him grab a medal on the international stage.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve been training with the Scotland squad for two years now and since I got back from the World Championships I had my training set towards this European Championships.</p>
      <p>“There were selections up in Alloa which were quite exciting and tense and all my efforts went towards it in the hope that I would be successfully selected.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: “Coming third at the European Championships is a real stepping stone for me.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a long-time dream to have earned a medal at an international competition and finally all the hard work has paid off. I had been training very hard in preparation for this competition.</p>
      <p>“I cannot thank everyone enough for all their help and support that I was given on the lead up to this competition, however my biggest thanks would go to my instructor Mr David Condie.</p>
      <p>“If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be in the position I am now. This experience was absolutely jaw-dropping and I really hope to attend more events like this in the future and return home with more medals to add to the collection.”</p>
