        <i>Defra figures show 8% rise over last year, with most cases involving household rubbish</i>
      </p>
      <p>Councils had to clear up more than a million incidents of fly-tipping last year in England, as figures show the problem continues to rise.</p>
      <p>Local authorities reported 1,072,000 incidents in 2018-19, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/11/incidents-of-fly-tipping-in-england-jump-by-almost-40-in-six-years">up 8% on the 998,000 cases in 2017</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/11/incidents-of-fly-tipping-in-england-jump-by-almost-40-in-six-years">-18</a>, the latest statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) revealed.</p>
      <p>Nearly two-thirds (62%) of fly-tipping cases involved household rubbish, ranging from black bags to the debris from house and shed clearances, old furniture and carpets and waste from small-scale DIY projects.</p>
      <p>The rubbish was most commonly dumped on roads and pavements, accounting for almost half the incidents reported.</p>
      <p>A third of all the incidents (33%) were the size of a small vanload, with 30% the equivalent of a “car boot or less”. Single items, such as mattresses or pieces of furniture, made up just under a fifth (18%).</p>
      <p>Rubbish dumped illegally included tens of thousands of cases of demolition and construction waste, white goods, garden waste and electrical items.</p>
      <p>Defra urged care over the data, as many local authorities have altered the way they record and report fly-tipping in the past few years.</p>
      <p>However the statistics suggest the problem is on the rise and risks returning to levels not seen for a decade. The figures also no longer include an estimate of how much it costs councils to clear up fly-tipping, apart from the small number of incidents classed as the size of a tipper lorry load or larger, with cost £12.9m in 2018-19 – up from £12.2m the previous year.</p>
      <p>As part of efforts to tackle the problem, local authorities carried out almost half a million enforcement actions, ranging from investigations to issuing fixed penalties and pursuing prosecutions.</p>
      <p>The number of penalty notices has continued to rise, up 11% to 76,000 in 2018-19, including fines for fly-tipping and littering associated with fly-tipping.</p>
