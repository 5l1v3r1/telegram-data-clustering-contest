        <b>Just a couple of weeks ago, Jane told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lotto-winner-jane-park-says-20732071"><i>Mirror</i></a>:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>Seeing the positive pregnancy test was more exciting than seeing the winning numbers on my lottery ticket.<br/><br/>It’s a crazy time but I am so happy.<br/><br/>People think ­winning the lottery is the best thing that can happen to you but this is ­something that no amount of cash could buy.</blockquote>
      <p>Jane was 13 weeks into her pregnancy and was looking forward to co-parenting with her baby’s father, a friend called Barry.</p>
      <p>23-year-old <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/celebrity/scottish-euromillions-winner-offering-a-huge-amount-of-cash-for-someone-to-date-her/">Jane</a>, from Edinburgh, shot to fame in 2013 when she won £1,000,000 on the Euromillions after buying her first ever lucky dip ticket at the age of 17.</p>

      <p>Her first few purchases after winning included a £25,000 BMW, a £17,000 VW Beetle and an £18,000 Range Rover.</p>
      <p>However, she later considered suing lottery bosses in 2017 after claiming winning the money at such a young age ruined her life.</p>
      <p>
        <b>At the time, Jane told various different news outlets:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <blockquote>I thought it would make my life 10 times better but it’s made it 10 times worse. I wish I had no money most days.<br/><br/>I say to myself, ‘My life would be so much easier if I hadn’t won.’</blockquote>
      <p>Our thoughts are with Jane at this sad time.</p>
