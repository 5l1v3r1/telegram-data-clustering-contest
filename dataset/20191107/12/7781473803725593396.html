      <p>Mercedes-Benz India has launched the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mercedes-benz/v-class-m734/">Mercedes-Benz V-Class</a> Elite MPV in India at Rs 1.1 crore, ex-showroom. This is the flagship model in the V-Class line-up. <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mercedes-benz/v-class/elite-v8771/">V-Class Elite</a> sits above the two V-Class variants which are already available in India and were launched in January 2019. The Elite is available with a two-year/30,000km Star Ease maintenance package for Rs 1.09 lakh.</p>

      <p>The V-Class now gets minor updates to its styling. There is a new diamond-mesh pattern to the grille and a new bumper with a much wider air dam. There are three new paint shades as well. On the inside, the horizontally slatted air vents have been replaced by the new turbine-style designs while there are new dials in the instrument cluster. Also new is the Tartufo Nappa leather upholstery colour and the patterned gloss black dash finish. A new feature is that the second-row gets powered, reclining seats as standard, similar to the one seen on the S-Class. Also, the centre console is not cooled, these also house heated/cooled cup holders.</p>

      <p>The Elite now also gets a new drivetrain. The V 220d is now available with the BSVI compliant 2.0-litre 4-cylinder OM 654 diesel engine in its 165PS and 380Nm iteration. This, as in the latest C and E-Class, is now paired with the brand's 9G-Tronic nine-speed torque convertor automatic.</p>
      <p>The V-Class Elite is now the top-trim in the V-Class line-up. This model has sold in triple digit units, this is higher than what Mercedes expected, hence the new variant.</p>
