      <p>LOGAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Three judges and a court staffer were killed in Afghanistan on Thursday after Taliban militants stopped their car in the latest attack on the judiciary, officials said.</p>
      <p>Abdullah Hasrat, a spokesman for the governor in eastern Paktia province where the judges worked, told Reuters the incident took place in Mohammad Agha district of neighboring Logar province.</p>
      <p>“They were traveling in a car but were stopped by the Taliban checkpoint on the road,” Hasrat said.</p>
      <p>No group has claimed responsibility for attack, which came as the victims were driving to the capital, Kabul.</p>
      <p>Taliban insurgents fighting to overthrow the foreign-backed Afghan government have long targeted the judiciary in retaliation for harsh sentences given to their fighters.</p>
      <p>Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters he was not aware of the attack but would check with local commanders.</p>
      <p>The Taliban now controls more territory than at any point since the United States’ invasion of the country in 2001.</p>
      <p>The United States is trying to end its longest ever war, but peace talks with the Taliban are currently stalled.</p>
      <p>As Afghan police casualties mounted, the Afghan government this year pulled back from hundreds of checkpoints in isolated areas that acted as a magnet for Taliban attacks.</p>
      <p>However, many Afghans complain that the Taliban and other militant groups have now set up checkpoints along the main highways, searching cars and looking for government employees.</p>
