      <p>During his early days as a professional footballer, Orlando Pirates star Thembinkosi Lorch produced a bit of magic that is still remembered as one of his finest bits of skill yet. Check it out!</p>
      <p>The skill move in question is the one he completed during his early days with Maluti FET College, when he <i>shibobo'd</i> Bidvest Wits star Thabang Monare, who was playing for Jomo Cosmos at the time, before sending him away with a filthy <i>rakhatha.</i></p>
      <p>Since then, the pair have done well for themselves, and have endeared themselves to the Orlando Pirates and Wits faithful as two of the club's crowd favourites.</p>
