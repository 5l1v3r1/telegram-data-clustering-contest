      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain lowered its security risk level for UK-flagged ships traveling through the Strait of Hormuz on Thursday, more than a month after one of its tankers was finally released from detention by Iran.</p>
      <p>The Stena Impero was seized in July by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in the Strait, a major oil shipping route, for alleged marine violations two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off Gibraltar. The Iranian ship was released in August.</p>
      <p>“UK-flagged ships will soon be able to transit the Strait of Hormuz without close Royal Naval accompaniment, following a decrease in the specific risk of detention of these vessels,” a government spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The Royal Navy’s Fleet Commander told Reuters in September that the deployment of its warships had helped to stabilize commercial shipping through the critical chokepoint.</p>
      <p>The UK Chamber of Shipping said it had been calling for a de-escalation of tensions in the Strait of Hormuz and welcomed the news that British-flagged ships would soon be able to transit the area without close Royal Navy protection.</p>
      <p>“We continue to urge all ships operating in the region to liaise with the relevant authorities to ensure their safety and to enable the free flow of goods across the world,” a spokesman for the trade association said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Global trade relies on the safe passage of goods and without this consumers and businesses could suffer with increased costs.”</p>
      <p>Several international merchant vessels have been attacked in the Gulf this year in incidents that have rocked world commodities trading. Washington has blamed Iran, which denies the accusation.</p>
