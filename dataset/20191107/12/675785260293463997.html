      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:52:32+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>John McDonnell today blasted ex-Labour MP Ian Austin for 'working for the Tories' over an attack on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>The Shadow Chancellor issued the hardline rebuke to the resigning MP - who became an independent earlier this year - after he said Mr Corbyn was unfit to lead the country and urged voters to back the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell told an audience in Liverpool: "He's now employed by the Tories: what else do you expect him to do in an election campaign?</p>
      <p>"Where you're employed by the Tories, you speak on behalf of the Tories. That's what this was about this morning."</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell said there were only a "tiny number" of members - a tenth of one per cent - accused of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>He added: "How dare the Tories raise the issue of racism at all when they have a leader who has consistently in his journalistic career written statements which are racist in themselves?"</p>

      <p>But he did say: "One anti-Semite is too many within our movement. That’s why we’ve done everything we can."</p>
      <p>Ian Austin left Mr Corbyn's party in February in response to what he claimed was a "culture of extremism, anti-Semitism and intolerance".</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> minister, who is a longtime critic of Mr Corbyn, today suggested "decent traditional patriotic Labour voters" should vote Tory.</p>
      <p>Yet sources confirmed Mr McDonnell's reference to Mr Austin being employed by the Tories was a reference to him being made a trade envoy to Israel by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a> in July.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell did not mention that Labour politicians have also been made trade envoys by Tory governments, including Rushanara Ali who remains an envoy to Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>Mr Austin also said this morning that he had not been offered a role by the Tories.</p>

      <p>Mr Austin, a former press secretary to Gordon Brown, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I'm not a Tory but I wouldn't say <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> is unfit to be our prime minister in the way that I say that about Jeremy Corbyn."</p>
      <p>Asked if he was advocating for the electorate to vote for Mr Johnson over Mr Corbyn on December 12, Mr Austin said: "I am."</p>
      <p>Mr Austin, who was an MP for Dudley, added: "Look, the public has to make this choice. The British people have to decide this.</p>
      <p>"Lots of traditional Labour voters are going to be grappling with this question.</p>
      <p>"If they have got to face up to that, then I don't think people like me should have the luxury of running away from it.</p>
      <p>"What Jeremy Corbyn has done to the Labour Party, I don't want him to be able to do that to the country."</p>
      <p>Addressing criticisms of failing to tackle anti-Semitism made by ex-MP Ian Austin and the Jewish Chronicle newspaper, Labour said the party had made "absolutely clear anti-Semitism has no place" in its ranks.</p>
      <p>"Jeremy Corbyn is a lifelong campaigner against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, hatred and bigotry," said a party spokesman.</p>
      <p>"He has made it absolutely clear that anti-Semitism has no place in our party and society, and that no one who engages in it does so in his name.</p>
      <p>"The Labour Party is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community."</p>
