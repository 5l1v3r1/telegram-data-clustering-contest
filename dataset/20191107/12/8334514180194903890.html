      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian internet giant Yandex has started testing autonomous delivery robots, the latest addition to its technological arsenal, the company said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Named after the space exploration device, the Yandex.Rover is a cabin suitcase-sized robot that can navigate pavements at walking pace, carrying small packages, using adapted technology from the firm’s self-driving cars unit.</p>
      <p>Yandex, often described as ‘Russia’s Google’, operates a number of services that could benefit from autonomous delivery, in particular its restaurant delivery service Yandex.Eda, e-commerce arm Yandex.Market, a joint venture with Russian lender Sberbank, and recently launched service for grocery delivery, Yandex.Lavka.</p>
      <p>Testing for the Yandex.Rover is already underway at its Moscow headquarters, where the device moves by itself but under human supervision, the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Once the technology is perfected, Yandex will consider selling robots to other companies, as well as using them in company warehouses.</p>
      <p>Yandex’s head of self-driving, Dmitry Polishchuk, said that adapting existing technologies helped in the fast development of the Yandex.Rover, and is optimistic about their use going forward.</p>
      <p>“I believe robots like this will have a variety of applications in the near future, Polishchuk said. “They could become indispensable for the ‘last mile’ stage of logistics.”</p>
      <p>Yandex began testing its driverless cars in 2017. At the Skolkovo and Innopolis tech parks outside Moscow, driverless taxis operate in test zones.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2018, Yandex received a license to operate in Israel and will begin U.S-based testing from June 2020.</p>
