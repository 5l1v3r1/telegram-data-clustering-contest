        <b>Leinster have named their team for Friday night’s Guinness PRO14 clash with Connacht (KO 19.35) at the Sportsground which includes a number of returning Ireland internationals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are a number of changes to the team which secured a bonus-point 50-15 win over the Dragons last weekend.</p>
      <p>James Lowe keeps his spot on the wing while Hugo Keenan comes in at fullback and Adam Byrne starts on the right wing.</p>
      <p>Robbie Henshaw returns to outside centre where he partners Joe Tomane who also comes back into the side. Ross Byrne has been selected at out-half while Luke McGrath starts at scrum-half.</p>

      <p>Up front, Cian Healy and Andrew Porter start on either side of the increasingly impressive Rónan Kelleher at hooker.</p>
      <p>Scott Fardy captains the side from the second-row where he is joined by Devin Toner who keeps his spot from the win over the Dragons.</p>
      <p>The back-row is made up of Josh Murphy, Will Connors and Max Deegan.</p>
      <p>Rhys Ruddock and Rob Kearney are included on the bench after their efforts in Japan.</p>
