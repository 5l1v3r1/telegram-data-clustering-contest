      <p>One of the last places a president would want to be when his country's national team makes history in a Rugby World Cup final would be the loo. But that is where President Cyril Ramaphosa found himself after a badly timed bathroom break at the Yokohama Stadium in Japan.</p>

      <p>In the 66th minute of the final, wing <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/watch-siya-kolisis-home-town-celebrates-the-moment-he-lifts-the-world-cup-20191102">Makazole Mapimpi</a> became the first Springbok rugby player to score a try in a World Cup final, as South Africa beat England 32-12 on Saturday to claim the Webb Ellis Cup – their third in as many finals.</p>
      <p>Ramaphosa, who was at the stadium in Japan, revealed to the Bok squad that, because of his own nerves, he had missed the first try as he made a run to the bathroom. He made the remarks as the Boks began their trophy parade at the Union Buildings on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"During the match, I was nervous," Ramaphosa told the squad as he hosted them at the Union Buildings.</p>
      <p>"When they scored their first try, I had gone to the 'gents' because of my nervousness," he said to a chuckling crowd.</p>

      <p>Ramaphosa also revealed his interaction with the players and coaches when he met them before the match: "[Bok captain] Siya [Kolisi] told me he was nervous, [coach] Rassie Erasmus told me he was shaking like a leaf and some players were telling me they were nervous."</p>
      <p>The president said he hadn't bought any of it, because "when I looked into their eyes and shook their hands, I saw victory written in their eyes".</p>
      <p>Ramaphosa called the Boks "warriors" who "went to war", carrying the South African flag with pride.</p>

      <p>"Forward with the Boks, forward," the president exclaimed.</p>
      <p>The Boks have begun their trophy <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/springboks-bus-parade-heres-where-to-catch-a-glimpse-of-the-world-champions-20191105">parade</a> through the streets of the capital city, Pretoria, and will conclude on Monday in Cape Town, with visits to Durban, Port Elizabeth and East London along the way</p>
