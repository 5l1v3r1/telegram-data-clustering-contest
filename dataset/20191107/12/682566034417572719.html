      <p>Cape Town -<b> Unai Emery </b>remained defiant when asked about the possibility of being replaced by <b>Jose Mourinho </b>after seeing his <b>Arsenal </b>side's draw<b> Vitoria Guimaraes</b>.</p>
      <p>The spectre of former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho has started to hang over Emery as reports continue to link the Portuguese to the Arsenal hotseat.</p>
      <p>The Gunners denied suggestions over the weekend that Mourinho had dined with Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi as pressure continues to build on Emery.</p>
      <p>Another poor performance saw Arsenal lucky to leave Guimaraes with a 1-1 draw as Shkodran Mustafi’s header was cancelled out by an injury-time bicycle kick from Bruno Duarte.</p>
      <p>It was the fourth time in 10 days that Arsenal have failed to hold onto a lead and Mustafi’s 80th-minute effort was their first shot on target in a game where they toiled in the Portuguese rain.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s presence in the reverse fixture a fortnight ago ramped up the theories that he was a potential replacement should Emery lose his job.</p>
      <p>Asked about the Mourinho links and the fan criticism aimed at him following recent performances, Emery simply replied: “I am the coach.”</p>
      <p>The Spaniard has already had to deal with stripping Granit Xhaka of the captaincy after he swore at Arsenal’s fans as he was jeered following his substitution in the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The mounting pressure on his position will be tested once again this weekend as they visit high-flying Leicester but – despite a run of one win in six games across all competitions – Emery insists he seems progress on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“In this competition, our objective is to be the first in the group,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are going to play the next two matches to make sure of that position and now we are going to prepare the match against Leicester in a different competition.”</p>
      <p>Vitoria were bottom of Group F and had failed to take a single point ahead of Arsenal’s visit.</p>
      <p>But, after twice taking the lead in north London before two Nicolas Pepe free kicks secured a 3-2 win for Emery’s s side, they would get something here following another strong performance.</p>
      <p>Their own Pepe hit the crossbar with Marcus Edwards and Edmond Tapsoba drawing great saves from Emiliano Martinez in a first half dominated by the Primeira Liga side.</p>
      <p>They then rallied after falling behind and levelled through Duarte’s fine last-gasp effort before pushing for the win – almost finding it as Mustafi accidentally steered a cross inches wide of his own post before Rochinha’s drilled shot flashed across goal.</p>
