      <h1>Falkirk troll Stenhousemuir's dodgy Photoshop effort with suspicious hospitality advert</h1>
      <h2>The rivals enjoyed some tit-for-tat on Twitter after Stenny's viral post from earlier this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:15:18+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Social media can spot a hoax a mile off and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stenhousemuir-fc">Stenhousemuir</a> were caught trying to give their hospitality suite a suspicious makeover earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Ochilview and Old Trafford have their own distinct charms but it'd take a master of disguise to combine the two into one image and get away with it.</p>
      <p>Stenny tried boldly to meld <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> 's luxury lounge with their own hallowed turf visible through a window in the background.</p>
      <p>Of course, this could have been a marketing ploy, with the intention all along to get caught, but it didn't stop <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk-fc">Falkirk</a> putting the digital boot in.</p>

      <p>Their Lowland rivals took to Twitter to show off an "upgrade" of their own.</p>
      <p>But as you can see from the image below, something's not quite right. Namely, the massive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> crest lurking in the corner.</p>
      <p>Stenny blasted back by reminding the Bairns what happened the last time the two collided at Ochilview - a 4-2 victory for the home side in the 2018 Scottish Cup.</p>
      <p>Certainly, what the lower leagues lack in glamour, they more than make up for in patter.</p>
