      <p>Plymouth Argyle will have around 1,000 members of the Green Army cheering them on at their FA Cup first round clash away to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It is going to be the first time the Pilgrims have played at the 28,000-seat capacity University of Bolton Stadium since it opened in 1997.</p>
      <p>The tie has been made all-ticket for Argyle supporters, who have until 5pm today (Thursday) to make their purchases.</p>
      <p>It has been stressed there will be no pay-on-the-day option for fans attending the game.</p>
      <p>The Travel Club coaches will leave from outside the Devonport End at 6.30am on Saturday for the 600-mile round trip to the north-west of England.</p>
      <p>The last time that Argyle played an away game against Bolton was in January 1993, when Wanderers played their fixtures at Burnden Park.</p>
      <p>It will be the sixth this season that Argyle will have been watched by more than 1,000 members of the Green Army at an away match.</p>
      <p>The previous five have been Crewe Alexandra (1,599), Newport County (1,039), Northampton Town (1,291), Swindon Town (2,300) and Exeter City (1,154).</p>
