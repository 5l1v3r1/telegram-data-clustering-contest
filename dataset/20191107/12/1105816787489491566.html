      <p><b>ISLAMABAD: </b>Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi underwent successful hernia surgery on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Currently incarcerated in the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) scandal, Abbasi was shifted from Adiala jail to a hospital after his health deteriorated on November 4.</p>
      <p>However, the surgery was delayed after the former prime minister’s blood pressure increased.</p>
      <p>Abbasi is expected to stay in the hospital for a week.</p>

      <p>The medical board, which recommended the hernia surgery, also said that Abbasi had stones in his bladder and kidney.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the former premier moved a petition in the accountability court seeking permission to be treated at Al-Shifa Hospital.</p>
      <p>“I want to undergo surgery at Al-Shifa Hospital at my expense. The Punjab government is not ready to take any responsibility,” he added.</p>
