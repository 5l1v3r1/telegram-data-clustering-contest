      <h1>Paul Merson wades into Granit Xhaka debate and sides with him against Arsenal boo boys</h1>
      <h2>Granit Xhaka was stripped of the Arsenal captaincy this week after a run-in with supporters against Crystal Palace</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T12:51:03+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Paul Merson has called on fans to recognise Granit Xhaka does everything he can for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal,</a> adding: "It's never nice to be booed by your own fans."</p>
      <p>Xhaka was stripped of the Gunners captaincy this week after a run-in with supporters during the 2-2 draw with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace.</a></p>
      <p>The Swiss took offence to fans booing him and reacted by swearing, cupping his ears and removing his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> shirt before storming off down the tunnel to the changing room.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal star Merson admits he isn't Xhaka's biggest fan, suggesting he understands why he singled him out at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>But says he's "paid badly" for his outburst by losing the captaincy.</p>

      <p>"I haven't been his biggest fan but I can understand what he went through the other week was hard to take," Merson told Sky Sports. "It's never nice to be booed by your own fans.</p>
      <p>"He's not the most talented footballer but he gives everything he can.</p>
      <p>"He makes mistakes but he always turns up. He's never injured, he always gets out on the pitch and looks for the ball.</p>
      <p>"It's frustrating because if he could have that time again he probably wouldn't have done what he did but he cares, he cares.</p>

      <p>"I don't care who you are, no one wants to be booed by their own fans, even [Lionel] Messi and [Cristiano] Ronaldo. He had a mad 30 seconds and he's badly paid for it.</p>
      <p>"To be captain of Arsenal is a massive honour."</p>
