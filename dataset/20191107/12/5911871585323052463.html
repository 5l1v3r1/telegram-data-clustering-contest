      <p>Anytime Rosalía comes out with a new single, that’s good news. It’s good news because the Barcelona flameco-pop star is good at making music, obviously. And it’s also good news because she’s one of the greatest music-video artists to come along in recent memory; her epochal “Malamente” clip is literally one of the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2063870/the-20-best-music-videos-of-the-2010s/franchises/2010s-in-review/">best videos of the decade</a>. Today, we get a new Rosalía song, and a new Rosalía video, both of which are reasons to celebrate.</p>
      <p>Thus far in 2019, Rosalía has been moving away from the mutant pop of her amazing 2018 album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2021465/stream-rosalias-new-album-el-mal-querer/music/album-stream/">A Mal Querer</a></i>. She’s been working toward a more centrist sound and teaming up with big urbano stars — J Balvin on “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2037533/rosalia-con-altura-j-balvin-el-guincho/video/">Con Altura</a>,” Ozuna on “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2054961/rosalia-ozuna-yo-x-ti-tu-x-mi-video/video/">Yo x Ti, Tu x Mi</a>.” But on the new track “A Palé,” Rosalía gets weird again, snarling hard over a head-spinning, rippling beat. Rosalía co-produced the song with pop insider Frank Dukes and regular collaborator El Guincho, and it bangs.</p>
      <p>The video, directed by <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2021465/stream-rosalias-new-album-el-mal-querer/music/album-stream/">Jora Frantzis</a>, finds Rosalía rocking gold fronts, enormous nails, and a Frida Kahlo unibrow. She and a troupe of surgical-scrubbed backup dancers take over a shipyard and look extremely tough. As a press release points out, Rosalía grew up in a town outside Barcelona that was dominated by the trucking industry, and the single’s title refers to shipping pallets. Check out the video below.</p>
