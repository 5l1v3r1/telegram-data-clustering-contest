      <p>BEIJING, Nov 7 — French musicals that were hits in their country have struck a chord and found a second life far from home — in China, where fans sing along with the foreign cast.</p>
      <p>Western musicals have grown in popularity in China in recent years, with fans flocking to classic Broadway shows such as “Cats” and “The Phantom of the Opera”.</p>
      <p>But French shows have given American musicals a run for their money, with “Notre-Dame de Paris”, “Mozart, L’Opera Rock” and “The Red and the Black” filling theatres.</p>
      <p>French musicals have gained fans in a Communist-ruled country that sees itself as the heir of the Paris Commune, a revolutionary government that briefly ruled the French capital in 1871.</p>
      <p>“Notre-Dame”, which is based on Victor Hugo’s classic novel, was one of the first French musicals to break into the Chinese market in 2002.</p>
      <p>The show sold out this summer after the iconic Parisian Cathedral’s roof burned down.</p>
      <p>Hugo and his social stance have found enduring popularity in China, and the French author was once included on a list of 100 foreign cultural figures President Xi Jinping found inspiring.</p>
      <p>“Les Miserables”, Hugo’s revolutionary-themed musical, was rewarded with a 20-minute standing ovation from the audience when it was performed in Shanghai last year, according to state media.</p>
      <p>“French shows are generally adaptations of masterpieces or historic events and they reflect the intensity of social struggle,” said Wang Ruiqi, a student enthralled by “The Red and the Black”.</p>
      <p>The rock opera — adapted from French author Stendhal’s classic novel about a young man’s ambitions to climb the social ladder from modest beginnings in 19th century France — began its 50-show tour of China in October.</p>
      <p>Most theatres quickly sold out, with tickets going for ¥1,180 (RM692) — higher than the minimum wage in some regions.</p>
      <p>“There’s a real musical culture in China, strangely more than in France,” said Laurent Ban, who plays the bad guy, Monsieur Valenod, in the musical.</p>
      <p>Su Dewei, 45, and his wife attended a show in Beijing.</p>
      <p>“I often watch musicals online,” Su said, adding: “French musicals.”</p>
      <p>In “The Red and the Black”, he said, “there’s humour and the stage decoration is beautiful.”</p>

        <b>Box office hits</b>
      </p>
      <p>China has a rich history of various forms of elaborate operas — though it went through a dark period when Chairman Mao Zedong’s powerful wife, Jiang Qing, cracked down on the arts during the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution.</p>
      <p>But music made a comeback as China opened up to the world following Mao’s death.</p>
      <p>In total, 1.6 million people watched 2,460 musicals in China in 2018, bringing ¥428 million in box office receipts — almost double the previous year, according to industry figures.</p>
      <p>More than half of the shows that made their China debut last year were English-language musicals, while 35 per cent were French, German and Austrian.</p>
      <p>“Cats” was the top seller, taking almost a quarter of the box office, followed by “Chicago”.</p>
      <p>The best-selling French musical was “Mozart, L’Opera Rock” which came in fifth followed by “Romeo et Juliette”.</p>
      <p>Yu Xinyue, who produces “The Red and the Black” in China, said the distinctive French touch is the ability to express emotions through musicals.</p>
      <p>“Anglo-Saxon shows place more emphasis on drama and how to tell stories,” Yu said.</p>
      <p>At the Beijing show, the mostly young female audience sang along to the musical’s most famous songs — though many likely don’t speak any French.</p>
      <p>“It’s funny because (the Chinese audience) was very different 15 years ago,” said Ban, who has performed in French musicals in China for years.</p>
      <p>“The audiences were very calm,” he said.</p>
      <p>But today they “let themselves go and express their emotions.” — AFP</p>
