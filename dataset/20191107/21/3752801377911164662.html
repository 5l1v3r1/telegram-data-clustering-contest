      <p>At least 10 Nigerian soldiers have been killed and nine severely injured in an ambush by jihadists in restive northeast Nigeria, military sources said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Another 12 soldiers were missing after a column of troops on patrol was ambushed by the fighters on Wednesday in Damboa district of Borno state, a military officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Fighters loyal to the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the killings, but said they had slain 22 soldiers after an assault by the army.</p>
      <p>A decade-long jihadist insurgency in northeast Nigeria has killed 35 000 people, displaced two million others and spilt into neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>"We lost 10 troops in the intense fighting with the terrorists who ambushed our soldiers conducting a clearance operation in the area," said the officer, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak about the incident.</p>
      <p>"Nine soldiers were injured and 12 are still missing."</p>
      <p>The troops came under attack while returning to their base in Damboa, 88km from the state capital Maiduguri, said a second military officer who gave the same casualty toll.</p>
      <p>Soldiers were forced to withdraw after an hour-long battle in which nine jihadists were also killed, said the second source.</p>
      <p>The source said militants burnt five military vehicles and took away a pickup truck along with six machine guns.</p>
      <p>The military sources initially attributed the attack to the Boko Haram faction led by long-time leader Abubakar Shekau as it took place close to its stronghold in Sambisa forest.</p>
      <p>But the killings were later claimed by rival jihadists loyal to the Islamic State group.</p>
      <p>A statement released by ISIS propaganda arm Amaq said the faction's fighters had killed 22 troops after the Nigerian army attacked them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jihadist splitÂ </b>
      </p>
      <p>Boko Haram has splintered into two major factions: one loyal to Shekau and the other aligned to IS.</p>
      <p>There has been a lull in attacks on troops from the jihadist factions in recent weeks as the military has intensified operations against the fighters.</p>
      <p>According to security sources, jihadists have been forced to flee into Cameroon and Chad or hide in camps on several islands in Lake Chad.</p>
      <p>Attacks on Nigerian troops had increased since June last year, with most of the deadly assaults blamed on or claimed by the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) faction.</p>
      <p>ISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016 and focuses on attacking military targets while Boko Haram is notorious for attacks on civilians.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Mai Mala Buni, the governor of Yobe, one of three northeast Nigerian states beset by the jihadist conflict, called for dialogue with the fighters to help end the violence.</p>
      <p>"No conflict of this nature anywhere in the world has been resolved solely by military means," he told a security gathering.</p>
      <p>"We therefore suggest that we should seek - and use - back channels to open communications and contacts that both sides could trust as credible."</p>
