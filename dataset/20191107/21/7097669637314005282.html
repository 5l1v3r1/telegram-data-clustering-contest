        <li>A team of divers followed up discovering <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a27632499/17th-century-wine-discovered/">300-year-old wine</a> with <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-hundreds-bottles-liquor-salvaged-wwi-era.html"><u>a new find of 100-year-old cognac</u></a>.</li>
        <li>Technology has made 2019 <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/navy-ships/a28568445/shipwreck-discovery-golden-age/"><u>a golden age</u></a> for shipwreck discovery.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/home/food-drink/a27731683/cognac-cocktail-recipe/">cognac</a> and Benedictine must be analyzed for drinkability after 100 years.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Divers for a company specializing in “salvaging alcohol from shipwrecks” have brought 900 bottles to the surface of the Baltic Sea from a <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-hundreds-bottles-liquor-salvaged-wwi-era.html"><u>100-year-old shipwreck</u></a>. The team, assembled by spirit salvagers <a href="http://www.oceanexplorer.se/">Ocean X</a>, dove to more than 250 feet deep with remote-controlled vehicles in order to retrieve the bottles. The condition of the ship and the surroundings of the wreck made the scenario too dangerous even for trained deep divers.</p>
      <p>Some bottles are from an exigent brand called <a href="https://www.liquor.com/brands/benedictine/"><u>Benedictine</u></a>, kind of a boozy Dr. Pepper cousin with “27 herbs and spices.” The company was just 50 years old when Germans bombed the doomed steamship <i>Kyros</i> in 1917, sinking 300 bottles of Benedictine and 600 bottles of a long-gone cognac brand called De Haartman. The description makes Benedictine sound like a bitters, but like cognac, it’s a full-throttle 80 proof, which could make both items more likely to have lasted in drinkable form for 100 years.</p>
      <p>Ocean X was behind the so-called “<a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a27632499/17th-century-wine-discovered/">shipwreck wine</a>” <a href="https://www.ancient-origins.net/news-history-archaeology/shipwreck-wine-0012101"><u>found in the North Sea</u></a> earlier this year. These bottles were over 300 years old, found in the midst of a much more deteriorated wooden ship at a depth of just 120 feet. The deterioration was bad news for the salvagers, but likely made for a safer dive that could still be done by people in deep diving suits rather than robots.</p>
      <p>In deep, freezing cold, dark water like that of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Baltic-Sea"><u>Baltic Sea</u></a> and the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/North-Sea"><u>North Sea</u></a>, items are in a de-facto cold storage. The divers from the Ocean X team scout these regions for wrecks that could hold an antique, but tipsy cargo. In their work, they’ve also <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/364845-sunken-submarine-sweden-russia/"><u>alerted authorities</u></a> to wrecks they spot that aren’t in their specific wheelhouse, like an intact Russian submarine found in Swedish waters.</p>
      <p>The ambitious Ocean X team is looking to expand its territories <a href="http://www.oceanexplorer.se/panama-guna-yala-san-blas-2/"><u>into Panama</u></a>, where an island chain populated with indigenous people offers rich wreck-diving potential. And while not everyone finds 900 bottles of fine spirits or 300-year-old wine on their scuba trips, wreck diving is one of the <a href="https://www.padi.com/courses/wreck-diver"><u>most popular forms of diving</u></a>, to an extent that <a href="https://www.leisurepro.com/blog/scuba-dive-destinations/5-artificial-wreck-dives-world/"><u>artificial wrecks</u></a> have sprung up to serve tourists the same way the world is now dotted with artificial coral reefs. No word on whether these artificial wrecks are stocked with 100-year-old cognac.</p>
      <p>What will happen to the hundreds of bottles pulled up from the <i>Kyros</i>? Like the 12 surviving bottles of wine from the North Sea, they’ll likely be auctioned. One bottle of 300-year-old Madeira wine <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/news-trends/article/2058648/300-year-old-madeira-wine-fetches-us39000-christies"><u>sold for $39,000</u></a> in 2017. <a href="https://www.christies.com/departments/Wine-Spirits-61-1.aspx?pagesection=upcoming-auctions#upcoming-auctions"><u>Christie’s estimates</u></a> auction prices between $500 and $1,000 for some wines that are around 100 years old, and those weren’t found in a shipwreck 250 feet underwater.</p>
      <p>Ocean X has made huge news with its two recent shipwreck finds, but the world is apparently chock full of antique liquors trapped on the seafloor. In 2014, divers found a bottle of <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2728383/Fancy-200-year-old-G-T-gin-like-alcohol-shipwreck-Baltic-sea-experts-say-drinkable.html"><u>a gin-like spirit</u></a> in a 200-year-old shipwreck in the Baltic Sea. Salvagers found <a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2015/05/shipwreck-could-hold-vast-stock-of-250-year-old-rum/"><u>a “vast” amount of rum</u></a> as part of a treasure-laden shipwreck in 2015.</p>
      <p>Wildly, <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/culture/most-valuable-treasure-recovered-from-shipwrecks"><u>this 2015 list</u></a> of the most valuable treasure from shipwrecks includes nine collections of gold and other precious metals and gems and one collection of 300 <i>empty</i>, millennia-old Roman wine jugs, betrayed by much more biodegradable stoppers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine-dark_sea_(Homer)"><u>The wine-dark sea</u></a>, indeed.</p>
