      <h1>Biden's opposition to moving Israel embassy in direct conflict with past statements</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:43:30+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:43</time> by <a rel="author">Vandana Rambaran</a></address>
      <p>Despite supporting the idea of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-opens-embassy-in-jerusalem-recognizing-city-as-true-capital-of-israel">moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem</a> for over three decades, former vice president and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/joe-biden">2020 hopeful Joe Biden</a> abandoned his previous stance on the issue and said he wouldn't have made the move "in the first place."</p>
      <p>In an interview with PBS News Hour on Friday, Biden said that although he would not reverse President Trump's decision to move the embassy at this point, he <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/watch-our-interview-with-joe-biden">said</a>: "I wouldn't have done it in the first place."</p>
      <p>A person close to Biden's campaign told Fox News on Thursday that Biden's comments are "not out of synch with the position that he's had" but rather are a criticism of the way Trump handled the decision, which drew the ire of Palestinians who also stake claim to the land.</p>

      <p>"His objection was not to the move but to the way it was done. It should have been made in the context of a larger deal that achieved important concessions for the peace process," the source told Fox News.</p>

      <p>Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Biden said in a statement to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2020-democrats-embassy-israel-jerusalem-trump-d4dc1cf5-96d6-4801-8205-6f0ef0858303.html">Axios</a> that "Vice President Biden would not move the American embassy back to Tel Aviv, but he would re-open our consulate in East Jerusalem to engage the Palestinians."</p>
      <p>In 2018, Trump made good on a main campaign promise to appease his conservative and evangelical base by formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving the embassy to the city.</p>
      <p>Biden backed numerous pieces of legislation passed by the Senate during his tenure as a representative from Deleware that supported both moving the embassy and recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel-- a law that was waived by Trump's predecessors.</p>
      <p>“Joe Biden spent literally decades promising to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, only to fail when he had eight years as vice president to do it. President Trump made a similar promise, but unlike Joe Biden, he actually stuck to his word and got it done,” Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement to Fox News on Thursday.</p>

      <p>During former President Barack Obama's campaign in 2008, Biden said "it's been my position for years," to have Jerusalem recognized as the undivided capital city of Israel.</p>
      <p>"Jerusalem must be the capital of Israel. Whatever decision the Israelis make, that's a decision we'll support,” Biden said at the time.</p>
      <p>“I think we should move the embassy, but you don't have a [Israeli] government asking us to move the embassy there. Let them make the judgment,” he added.</p>
      <p>Biden's flip flop on the issue marks yet another attempt by the candidate to align himself with left-leaning voters by reversing his previously held stances, which has drawn the ire of other Democratic contenders vying for the nomination.</p>
      <p>Biden, who has remained in the lead according to most national polls but is neck and neck with two other candidates--  <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bernie-sanders">Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt</a>.-- came under fire for changing his decades-long position on the Hyde Amendment in June.</p>

      <p>His <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/joe-biden-reverses-stance-on-hyde-amendment-announces-opposition-amid-2020-outcry">2020 Democratic rivals criticized Biden's previous support</a> as a senator for the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to subsidize abortions except for cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is endangered -- a notion some of his campaign rivals fear has a disproportionate impact on minority communities.</p>

      <p>Biden reversed his stance on the controversial piece of legislation at a campaign rally, saying he "can no longer support an amendment that makes" a woman's right to an abortion "dependent on someone's ZIP code."</p>
