      <p>Dropbox, which competes with Alphabet Inc’s (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/GOOGL.O">GOOGL.O</a>) Google, Microsoft Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MSFT.O">MSFT.O</a>) as well as Box Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/BOX.N">BOX.N</a>), has relied on its “freemium” model to attract more customers. The model allows customers to use the platform’s basic features for free, but charges for additional services.</p>
      <p>It acquired e-signature company HelloSign earlier this year and has partnered with rivals Microsoft and Google’s file storage platforms, aiming to expand its reach and convert free users to paid customers.</p>
      <p>Dropbox had 14 million subscribers at the end of the quarter, up from 12.3 million a year earlier and ahead of estimates of 13.89 million, according to FactSet.</p>
      <p>Average revenue per user rose to $123.15, beating Refinitiv estimates of $122.82.</p>
      <p>The company’s deferred revenue, which measures future business for subscription-based software vendors, was $541.1 million, above estimates of $534 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>Revenue rose 19% to $428.20 million in the third quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of $423.48 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>However, net loss widened to $17 million, or 4 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $5.8 million, or 1 cent per share, a year earlier.</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, Dropbox earned 13 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 11 cents per share.</p>
      <p>Shares of the company, which initially went up 5% in extended trading, were last down 3%.</p>
