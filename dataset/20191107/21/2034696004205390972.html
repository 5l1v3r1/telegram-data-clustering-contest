      <p>The accompanying music video at points shows Slowthai (real name Tyron Frampton) running about in slow-mo outside a housing estate before he jumps into a convertible with Mura Masa (Alex Crossan).</p>
      <p>The upbeat song, which with Frampton’s spoken-word delivery is somewhat reminiscent of <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-streets">The Streets</a>, has a number of cutting lyrics including: <i>“People say they’re busy / Well, fuck off!”</i></p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>NME </i>earlier this year, <a href="https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/mura-masa-interview-reading-album-two-2542897#l0pHcH3b7Hl8kf1A.99">Mura Masa revealed that his new album is going to have a rock-influenced sound.</a> He said: “I’m sort of making a guitar album in a way. There’s a really interesting intersection where it used to be garage bands and now it’s internet bands, and that’s the new DIY. So yeah I’m kind of going down that way.”</p>
      <p>The producer also revealed the next album is totally finished. He said: “There’s some quite surprising ones…some amazing UK artists and some American artists, a lot of indie and rock people. I’m looking forward to surprising a bit!”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slowthai-heartbroken-pull-liam-gallagher-tour-2551212">Meanwhile, Slowthai has recently spoken of his “heartbreaking” decision to pull out of his upcoming support slot</a> on <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/LIAM-GALLAGHER">Liam Gallagher’</a>s Autumn tour.</p>
      <p>The controversial Mercury-nominated rapper was <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slowthai-cancels-liam-gallagher-tour-support-slot-2541052">due to join the former Oasis frontman on his solo November arena gigs</a>. However, it later emerged that he had opted out of the shows to <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/slowthai-join-brockhampton-tour-after-withdrawing-liam-gallagher-support-slot-2-2542076">instead join Brockhampton on the road in the US</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been a dream of mine to meet Liam, so it was heartbreaking to do that,” Slowthai has told <a href="https://www.qthemusic.com/">Q</a> in a new interview. “I didn’t want it to be like I was messing everything up, but I gotta think of the grand scheme of things… it made a lot of sense.”</p>
