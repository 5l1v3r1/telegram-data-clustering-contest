      <p>BURKE, Wis. - A vehicle fire caused damage to a metal outbuilding in the town of Burke Thursday.</p>
      <p>A news release from the Sun Prairie Volunteer Fire Department said firefighters were sent to the 3000 block of Seminary Spring Road after receiving a report of a vehicle fire that was impinging on a building. </p>
      <p>When crews arrived, they saw heavy black smoke and a pickup truck engulfed in flames. The truck was near a metal outbuilding and "dangerously close" to a large duplex. </p>
      <p>The release said crews quickly extinguished the fire, and the truck was deemed a total loss. Officials are still assessing the damage that the outbuilding sustained. </p>
      <p>The fire remains under investigation, but the total damage to the truck, garage, outbuilding and machines inside it are estimated to be $40,000.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported. </p>
