      <p>We already know that after much hoping and pleading from fans <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474289/bryce-dallas-howard-really-wants-the-original-actors-back-for-jurassic-world-3">and cast alike</a>, Colin Trevorrow’s <i>Jurassic World 3</i> will bring back Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern and Sam Neill <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480915/jurassic-world-3-officially-bringing-back-original-jurassic-park-stars">to reprise their roles</a> from the original <i>Jurassic Park</i>. But the members of that original trio won’t be the only ones in this franchise returning to close out the <i>Jurassic World</i> trilogy. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2315561/jurassic-world-3?pv=search"><i>Jurassic World 3</i></a> is bringing back two more familiar faces: Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda.</p>
      <p>The two actors made their franchise debuts in last year’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2431050/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-review"><i>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</i></a>, and will reprise their roles in <i>Jurassic World 3</i>-- according to <a href="https://collider.com/jurassic-world-3-justice-smith-daniella-pineda-return/">Collider</a>. As you’ll recall, Justice Smith portrayed Franklin Webb, the systems analyst and go-to computer guy for Claire Dearing’s Dinosaur Protection Group. Daniella Pineda played Zia Rodriguez, another member of the DPG who served as the organization’s paleoveterinarian.</p>
      <p>Plot details remain under wraps for <i>Jurassic World 3</i>, so it’s unknown what role the duo will play in the threequel. But with the dinosaurs now out in the wild after <i>Fallen Kingdom</i>, the DPG will have its work cut out for it. Maybe Justice Smith’s character can help catch ‘em all (that’s a <i>Detective Pikachu</i> reference folks).</p>
      <p>Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda join <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482815/jurassic-world-3-an-updated-cast-list">a cast that includes</a> faces of the franchise Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Pratt, Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum. Also starring in <i>Jurassic Park 3</i> are Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood, BD Wong as mad scientist Dr. Wu, and franchise newcomers Mamoudou Athie and DeWanda Wise.</p>
      <p>While we are all excited to see the return of the <i>Jurassic Park</i> OGs, it is cool that there will be some carryover from the rest of the <i>Jurassic World</i> franchise. Justice Smith’s Franklin Webb was delightfully awkward and anxiety-ridden. Daniella Pineda was also a nice addition to the franchise and proved quite capable in healing Blue, and I imagine her skills will be put to the test again in this third film before it’s over.</p>
      <p>The cast is rounding out nicely for this climactic chapter in the Jurassic Saga(?) but I’ve got to say, with the original <i>Jurassic Park</i> trio returning, I’m still kind of hoping that Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards, who played kids Tim and Lex, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481226/sounds-like-jurassic-parks-kids-want-to-return-for-jurassic-world-3-too">can return as well</a>, at least in cameo form. We don’t know what the future of this franchise is beyond this film so this might be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477209/jurassic-world-3-will-be-a-celebration-of-the-entire-franchise-colin-trevorrow-says">the last chance</a> to get the band back together.</p>
      <p>We still have a ways to go until <i>Jurassic World 3</i>’s 2021 release date, but fortunately, we’ve already <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480375/why-battle-at-big-rock-has-me-excited-for-jurassic-world-3">gotten a taste</a> of what the third film in this highly successful franchise may have in store for audiences. Colin Trevorrow’s short film <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480317/see-jurassic-worlds-new-short-film-battle-at-big-rock"><i>Battle At Big Rock</i></a> gives us an idea of what a world with dinosaurs on the loose might be like.</p>
      <p><i>Jurassic World 3</i> roars into theaters on June 11, 2021. That’s a ways off, so check out what movies are coming out next year in our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480313/new-movie-releases-2020-movie-release-date-schedule?pv=search">2020 Release Schedule</a>.</p>
