        <b>A Labour candidate in Aberdeenshire has quit following a row over anti-Semitism.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kate Ramsden stood down in the Gordon constituency after the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog post from her.</p>
      <p>It said she compared Israel to an abused child who becomes an abusive adult.</p>
      <p>Another Scottish Labour candidate, Frances Hoole, has also been dropped over a social media post attacking her SNP opponent.</p>
      <p>Scottish Labour's ruling body had decided to reconsider Ms Ramsden's candidacy.</p>
      <p>A Labour Party source said: "We took immediate action to have Kate Ramsden's candidacy reconsidered in light of the material that we found.</p>
      <p>"Staff in Labour HQ found these posts when conducting extra due diligence checks.</p>
      <p>"Staff immediately alerted Scottish Labour, who informed the Scottish Executive Committee, which decided to re-interview Kate Ramsden about the new posts that had been found.</p>
      <p>"Kate Ramsden stood down as a candidate and is therefore not a Labour candidate in the election."</p>
      <h3>Apology</h3>
      <p>Ms Ramsden has published an apology for her blog.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have taken the decision to step down as Labour Party candidate for Gordon, following criticism of a blog written at the height of the bombardment of Gaza by the government of Israel.</p>
      <p>"I can see why many Jewish people have been hurt by my words.</p>
      <p>"That was never my intention and I apologise unreservedly."</p>
      <p>Frances Hoole was earlier dropped as Labour's candidate in Edinburgh South West.</p>
      <p>The party refused to endorse Ms Hoole after she posted an image on social media of her SNP rival, Joanna Cherry, being targeted with a bleach spray.</p>
      <p>Frances Hoole has apologised.</p>
