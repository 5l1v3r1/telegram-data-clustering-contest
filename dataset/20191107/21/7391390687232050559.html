      <p>If anyone is feeling good as hell right now, it's Lizzo. The champion of self love, creator of bops, and style goddess has a brand new magazine cover, and it's major. <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/lizzo-british-vogue-interview">Lizzo's <i>British Vogue </i>cover</a> just hit the internet, and it's yet another must-see moment from the star.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 7, Lizzo took to her Instagram to announce that she's the second of two <a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/emma-watson-december-issue-british-vogue-2019">cover stars for <i>British Vogue</i>'s December issue</a><i>. </i>For the image, Lizzo went full vintage glamour with a feather boa, strapless, deeply cut sweetheart neck Versace gown, and no less than Tiffany &amp; Co. and Chopard diamonds. No big deal, right?</p>
      <p>She went on to post more than just the cover image, though. While she thanked both the publication as a whole and editor Edward Enniful, a glance at her Instagram feed now reveals a multitude of images from her spread inside the magazine with captions you've got to read. Each new slide is a celebration of her cover, and they include one that's a low-key read of people who may judge her for the posting spam. In a post of her rocking a stunningly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4kzfTGhG7w/">bold black and white patterned gown</a>, she wrote, "You thought I wasn’t gonna post every single shot?"</p>
      <p>So glad you are, Lizzo. So glad you are.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most importantly, though, she took time to acknowledge her position as a plus size, black woman on a <i>Vogue</i> cover writing in a caption, "Big black girls, if you’re reading this... you’re a cover star. Nothin less. Period Pooh. Fin bitch. Thank you."</p>

      <p>As part of her work with <i>Vouge</i>, Lizzo also starred in the magazine's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s7YztS1hMI&amp;list=PLHlfmUA9UkXYYg_Mu4ih65jJbkf99invp">"My First" series </a>which sees celebrities reveal, well, their firsts. In the quick YouTube video, she gave a behind the scenes peek at her time shooting the cover. When asked what the first thing she does after a night out is, she answered, "The first thing I do after a night out is I shoot the cover of <i>British Vogue</i>...cause I'm hungover."</p>
      <p>You've got to love her.</p>

      <p>The "Truth Hurts" singer's cover comes after an already impressive year. In 2019, she scored a song in the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8533646/lizzo-truth-hurts-number-one-seventh-week-hot-100">top 10 of <i>Billboard's Hot 100</i></a> that has remained there<i>, </i>performed at the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/lizzos-2019-mtv-vmas-outfit-marked-her-as-a-literal-siren-18691668">MTV Video Music Awards</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/06/24/lizzo-confirms-shes-been-it-lively-bet-awards-performance/">BET Awards</a>, attended the <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/lizzo-wore-her-met-gala-coat-through-the-airport-its-a-total-boss-babe-move-17675398">Met Gala</a>, and got the stamp of 100% that b*tchness from none other than <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/rihanna-slid-into-lizzos-dms-after-the-vmas-her-message-will-make-fans-want-a-collab-stat-18706662">Rihanna</a>.
