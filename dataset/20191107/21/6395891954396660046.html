      <p><b>HILTON HEAD, S.C.Â (AP)</b> - A South Carolina man who went to McDonald's for a sweet tea says he received a little extra herbal substance on the side.</p>
      <p>The Island Packet reports Parrish Brown went to a McDonald's on Hilton Head Island and asked for a sweet tea with light ice and extra lemon.</p>
      <p>Brown now believes "extra lemon" was code for marijuana, since he found three bags of weed in his cup. He says he only realized it once he was "high as a kite."</p>
      <p>Brown says he'd never had marijuana, so he didn't recognize the taste. He says he paid regular price for the items.</p>
      <p>Beaufort County Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Bob Bromage says an investigation is ongoing. He didn't specify which McDonald's Brown had gone to.</p>
      <p>McDonald's didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
