      <h1>Alienware launches GPU upgrade kits for Area-51m gaming laptop</h1>
      <h2>Modular laptops are historically tough to pull off</h2>

      <h4>Forward-looking: The real appeal of a modular system like this is whether or not users will be able to upgrade to the next generation of graphics card. History would suggest that’s a big “negative” but we won’t know for a while longer.</h4>
      <p>Alienware at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year announced the <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/78178-alienware-unveils-area-51m-modular-gaming-laptop.html">Area-51m</a>, a flagship gaming laptop headlined by a user-upgradeable, desktop-class CPU and GPU. After nearly a year in waiting, the upgradeable GPUs are now available to purchase.</p>
      <p>Potential buyers may want to curb their enthusiasm a bit, however, as there’s not really much “new” here. Allow me to explain.</p>

      <p>The Dell subsidiary is offering the Alienware Area-51m upgrade kit with thermal module in <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/490-bfdm">Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070</a> and <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/accessories/apd/490-bfdj">RTX 2080</a> variants priced at $1,038.99 and $1,638.99, respectively. That’s a hefty premium over their desktop counterparts, sure, but such is the cost of doing business in the proprietary laptop industry.</p>
      <p>More underwhelming, still, is the fact that both GPU options have been available from the get-go when configuring a new system. Really, this means that the new upgrade kits are only appealing to those that skimped on their GPU out of the gate. Considering the Area-51m starts at $1,999.99, you've got to wonder just how many people would have opted for a low-end solution at this price point to begin with.</p>
