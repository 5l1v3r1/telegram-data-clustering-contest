        <b>BritBox is bringing things "back home"</b>
      </p>
      <p>The “vast majority” of British TV shows on <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> will disappear from the platform in the next 12 months.</p>
      <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/britbox-bbc-itv-team-new-streaming-service-2454672">BritBox</a> spokesperson, who told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/britbox-netflix-itv-bbc-british-shows-removed-a9193756.html"><i>The Independent</i></a> that British shows including <i>The Office</i> will come “back home” after exiting the US platform.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>BritBox, the brand new subscription-based streaming platform launched by the BBC and ITV today (November 7), aims to have the largest collection of British TV content ever assembled on a single website.</p>
      <p>“The vast majority of British shows will no longer be on Netflix within the next year,” ITV group communications and corporate affairs director Paul Moore said.</p>

      <p>Moore explained further that most BBC and ITV shows that have been licensed to Netflix and Amazon are on 12-month rolling contracts. Those shows will move to BritBox once those contracts have expired.</p>
      <p>He said that <i>The Office</i> “will be coming back home next spring” but confirmed that programmes that were co-productions between UK networks and Netflix or Amazon, such as <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/bodyguard-actually-modern-day-retelling-romeo-juliet-2377895"><i>Bodyguard</i></a>, “can’t come back home”.</p>
      <p>The strategy moving forward, Moore added, is that BritBox would not license British shows to other streaming platforms.</p>
      <p>Additionally, since its focus is on UK-produced series, the platform would not compete to acquire the rights to US or international shows.</p>
