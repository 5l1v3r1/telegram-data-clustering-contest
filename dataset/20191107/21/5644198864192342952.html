      <p>ROME: Holocaust survivor Liliana Segre has been placed under police protection after she received threats from far-right fanatics, security sources said on Thursday, highlighting concern about rising extremism in Italy.</p>
      <p>Segre, 89, called last month for the creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate hate, racism and anti-Semitism after she was the subject of a daily barrage of abuse on social media.</p>

      <p>Italy's right-wing parties did not back her proposal and the resulting controversy has only added to the abuse, with a neo-Nazi group this week hanging up a banner to denounce anti-fascism close to where she was making a public appearance.</p>
      <p>Segre declined to comment on being assigned a police escort. A security source said the police were only accompanying her to public events and were not providing round-the-clock protection.</p>
      <p>"It must be said that Liliana receives vastly more messages of support and solidarity than she does hate messages," said Paola Gargiulo, Segre's chief of staff.</p>
      <p>Segre was deported from Italy to Auschwitz in 1944 when she was 13 - one of 776 Italian children under the age of 14 who were sent to the Nazi concentration camp. Only 25 survived.</p>
      <p>She has dedicated much of her time in recent years to visiting schools to recount the horrors of the Holocaust and was named a life Senator in 2018.</p>
      <p>Israel's ambassador to Italy, Dror Eydar, expressed dismay at the news Segre needed a police escort.</p>
      <p>"An 89-year-old Holocaust survivor under guard symbolises the danger that Jewish communities still face in Europe today," he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Government ministers also expressed solidarity. "Forgive us Liliana. The politics of hate will not stop your commitment, nor ours," said Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova on Twitter.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from the leaders of the main rightist parties, the League and Brothers of Italy, who had opposed Segre's call for a parliamentary commission, warning that it could lead to censorship.</p>
      <p>The Centre of Contemporary Jewish Documentation (CDEC), said anti-Semitism appeared to be increasing in Italy, but was still much less pronounced than in France and Britain.</p>
      <p>CDEC researcher Stefano Gatti said that until the beginning of November 190 cases of anti-Semitism had been reported in Italy against 197 in all of 2018 and 130 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Most were social media attacks and verbal insults, with just two acts of minor violence registered this year.</p>
      <p>"The anti-Semitism we are seeing is getting more aggressive, but the number of anti-Semites in Italy is largely stable," said Gatti, pointing to surveys that suggested around 11 percent of Italians were hostile to, or prejudiced against Jews.</p>
