      <h1>Keystone oil pipeline expected to be partially restarted early next week: sources</h1>

      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - TC Energy Corp estimates the Keystone oil pipeline can be partially restarted anytime from Sunday to Tuesday, pending regulatory approval, after a more than 9,000-barrel leak in rural North Dakota, shippers on the line said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Crews in Walsh County, North Dakota, have been working to clean up the spill from the Keystone pipeline, which forced the line to be shut last week.</p>
      <p>The 590,000-barrel-per-day Keystone system is an important artery for Canadian heavy crude, imported by U.S. refiners, particularly in the Midwest.</p>
      <p>There is no timing yet on when the system will return to service, TC Energy spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email.</p>
      <p>TC Energy’s estimated restart time line does not yet have regulatory approval from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), two sources familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>The outage has already backed up barrels in Canada, sending the discount on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to an 11-month high on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Repairs are likely to be completed by Sunday, which will allow the company to be prepared for a restart, one shipper said.</p>
      <p>Analysts have said they expected Keystone to be offline for 10 to 12 days and be online by Sunday.</p>
      <p>TC Energy, former TransCanada Corp, said previously that the preliminary work to expose and extract the damaged section of pipe was expected to be completed by the end of this week.</p>
      <p>The pipeline may return to service within a couple of weeks, based on past spills, the president of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, the country’s biggest oil producer, said on a quarterly earnings call on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The outage has had “very little impact” on Canadian Natural, a shipper on the pipeline.</p>
