      <h1>ICPC replies Obono-Obla on persecution claim</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:12:59+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/361506-icpc-replies-obono-obla-on-persecution-claim.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission has accused the former chairman of the Special Investigation Panel for Recovery of Public Property Property, Okoi Obono-Obla, of stir public sentiments over his indictment for alleged fraud.</p>
      <p>The chairman of ICPC, Bolaji Owasanoye, stated this on Thursday in Abuja at a Special Town Hall Meeting on Fight Against Corruption, organised by the Ministry of Information and Culture.</p>
      <p>Mr Owasanoye was reacting to a letter by Mr Obono-Obla accusing Vice President Yemi Osinbajo of persecuting him because of his loyalty to President Muhammadu Buhari.</p>
      <p>President Buhari in August suspended Mr Obono-Obla over alleged “falsification of records and financial impropriety”.</p>
      <p>ICPC subsequently declared Mr Obono-Obla wanted after he repeatedly failed to appear before the commission to answer questions bordering on allegations of fraud and corruption.</p>
      <p>Reacting to Mr Obono-Obla’s letter to the president on the alleged persecution, Mr Owasanoye said that it was a “shenanigan’’ to cover up the allegations against the former SPIP chairman.</p>
      <p>“The strongest defense for an accused person is to come out and say I did not do it.</p>
      <p>“Any other defence is a shenanigan,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>The ICPC boss said that such behaviour was common among politically exposed persons accused of wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>He said some accused persons even parade fake medical reports and give excuses that they travel abroad to circumvent their trial.</p>
      <p>Mr Owasanoye therefore welcomed the move by the anti-corruption agencies to sanction any medical doctor who issues a fake medical report.</p>
      <p>He added that reports of oversea travels by suspects would also be investigated to ascertain their veracity. (NAN)</p>
