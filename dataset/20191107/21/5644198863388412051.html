      <p>MILAN: Napoli boast one of Serie A's most flamboyant club owners and one of its most successful coaches yet this week's events, which saw players rebel against a training retreat, have suggested that something has gone badly wrong behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>Runners-up three times in the last four seasons and exponents of entertaining football throughout that time, Napoli have slumped to seventh and Saturday's match at home to struggling Genoa has become a serious test.</p>

      <p>The crisis erupted after owner Aurelio De Laurentiis ordered the team into a week-long training retreat, known as a "ritiro", on Monday, even though such camps are seen by players as demeaning and outdated.</p>
      <p>Coach Carlo Ancelotti, whose future is now the subject of speculation, publicly disapproved and there were widespread reports that the players had ignored the decision following Tuesday's 1-1 draw with Salzburg in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The club responded with a strongly-worded statement about protecting its rights which implied it would fine the players or even take legal action against them.</p>
      <p>There were also reports of a dressing-room row between players and Di Laurentiis' son Edoardo, who is vice-president, and also an angry video call between Ancelotti and De Laurentiis senior.</p>
      <p>De Laurentiis, 70, a prominent Italian film producer, has resurrected Napoli since buying them in 2004 after they had been declared bankrupt and relegated to Serie C.</p>
      <p>However, he also has a tendency for making incendiary declarations, for falling out with his coaches - such as Ancelotti's predecessor Maurizio Sarri - and a reputation for interfering in team selection.</p>
      <p>"Questionable methods but unquestionable entrepreneurial flair," said Gazzetta dello Sport in an editorial on Thursday, saying that the club lacked an adequate management structure</p>
      <p>"A man who looks to the future has taken a step back into the 20th century," it added, referring to the ritiro.</p>
      <p>Questions were also raised over Ancelotti who has won domestic titles in Germany, England, France, and Italy as well as the Champions League three times.</p>
      <p>However, Ancelotti, who put his assistant and son David in charge for last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at AS Roma when he himself was suspended, has always seemed more comfortable at big clubs with spending power and where major titles were pretty much guaranteed - not the case with Napoli.</p>
      <p>"A strong club would have spotted the revolt in the making and nipped it in the bud," said Gazzetta.</p>
      <p>"But if you send the president's son to the dressing room to talk to the team and if the coach's son goes on the bench in a delicate match, with all due respect to those people, there is something that doesn't work."</p>
