      <h1>This MSI gaming laptop with a 240Hz screen has dropped to $1,400</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:47:29+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>It's a great time to buy a gaming laptop, even though <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a> hasn't quite arrived. If you've been saving up for a portable gaming station, one sale at Best Buy is especially enticing: you can get an MSI laptop with a 240Hz screen and an RTX 2060 graphics card for $1,399.99. That's a savings of $500 from the original MSRP.</p>
      <p>The full specifications of the MSI GS65 Stealth-478 (great name) includes a 9th-gen Intel Core i7-9750H processor, a 512GB PCIe SSD, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card. The 15.6-inch 1080p display is the main selling point, as it can show off games at 240Hzâ€”four times the refresh rate of the 60Hz monitors you're probably used to. There's also 32GB of 2666MHz RAM, while most other <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/pl?N=100157995&amp;LeftPriceRange=1200%201500&amp;Order=BESTMATCH">laptops in this price range</a> only come with 8 or 16GB.</p>
      <p>The laptop's RTX 2060 graphics card won't be able to push all games at 240 FPS, but you'll still get a great experience. <a href="https://us.msi.com/Laptop/GS65-Stealth-9SX/Specification">MSI's own website confirms</a> that this laptop uses a true RTX 2060, not the slower 'Max-Q' variant.
