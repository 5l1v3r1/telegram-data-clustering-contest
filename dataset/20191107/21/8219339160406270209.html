      <h1>Disney+ will join Apple TV+ on Fire TV when it launches on November 12</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:36:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/chmiller44/" target="_blank">Chance Miller</a></address>
      <p>Following the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/06/apple-tv-plus-tv-shows-movies-guide/">launch of Apple TV+ last week</a>, we’re now approaching the debut of Disney+. In an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/07/disney-dis-fiscal-q4-2019-earnings.html">CNBC</a> today, Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed that Disney+ will be coming to Amazon’s Fire TV platform — much like Apple TV+.</p>
      <p>In August, Disney confirmed the wide array of platforms where viewers would be able to watch Disney+, including Apple TV, Roku, Chromecast, and much more. Notably absent from that list, however, was Amazon Fire TV.</p>
      <p>Iger now says that Disney+ will be available on Fire TV starting on launch day, November 12. This means owners of Amazon’s various Fire TV devices, <a href="https://amzn.to/2WQVnLR">such as the Fire Stick</a>, will then be able to tune into Disney+ content.</p>
      <p>A report from the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> last month said that Amazon and Disney were clashing over advertising terms. Amazon reportedly wanted to sell a “substantial percentage of ad space on Disney apps,” but Disney was pushing back. The two seem to have resolved their disagreements, but details are unknown.</p>
      <p>For TV+, Apple has put an <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/24/apple-tv-amazon-fire/">emphasis on making</a> the service available on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/24/apple-tv-app-devices/">different platforms</a>, ranging from <a href="https://amzn.to/2WQVnLR">Fire TV</a> to <a href="https://amzn.to/2p1vpJ2">Roku</a> and various <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/13/samsung-smart-tv-airplay-2-apple-tv-app/">brands of smart TVs</a>, with more to come. Disney is taking a similar approach, as evident by today’s announcement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, for Apple users, Disney has yet to make any announcements about supporting Apple TV Channels. This integration would allow you to watch Disney+ directly in the Apple TV app on tvOS, Mac, iPadOS, and iOS.</p>
      <p>Disney also reported its earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter today, announcing revenue of $19.1 billion. Disney stock is up nearly 4% based on its earnings release. Iger has said in the past <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/10/22/disney-plus-price-apple-tv/">that he’s not worried</a> about Apple TV+ undercutting Disney+ on price, touting the expansive library of content that Disney+ will offer.</p>
      <p>Disney+ launches on November 12 for $6.99 per month in the US. It is coming to the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and other European regions in March 2020.</p>
