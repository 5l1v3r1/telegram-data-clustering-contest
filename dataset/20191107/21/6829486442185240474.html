      <h1>Elizabeth Moss Is Stalked By An Ex Only She Can See In The Trailer For ‘The Invisible Man’</h1>

      <p><i>The Invisible Man</i> is a strange property.</p>
      <p>A H.G. Wells story that was adapted into a series of increasingly ludicrous movies, it’s one of the less successful classic Universal horror properties for a reason. I mean, it’s just so hard to try and make a dude who you can’t see cinematically interesting — let alone work out what he’s actually meant to do for 90 minutes of his screentime.</p>
      <p>Well, from the looks of the trailer for the new <i>Invisible Man</i> reboot, Australia’s own Leigh Whannell has finally cracked the character.</p>

      <p>In this modern take, the Invisible Man is an abusive, maniacal scientist. When his ex-girlfriend, played by Elizabeth Moss, tries to make an escape from his controlling clutches, he fakes his own death, and drinks a potion that makes him invisible. That gives him full power to haunt and stalk her for as long as he likes, which he does, attempting to drive her totally insane.</p>
      <p>So: this isn’t just a new take on the Invisible Man himself, it’s a new take on the ghost story. This is a spectre who haunts you and you alone — and they’re not even dead.</p>
      <p>It shouldn’t be so surprising that Whannell has cracked a seemingly uncrackable problem. After all, he’s true Hollywood horror royalty — the man is the brains behind the <i>Saw </i>and the <i>Insidious</i> series, as well as the writer-director of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upgrade_(film)">the extraordinary horror-thriller flick <i>Upgrade</i></a>. (<a href="https://junkee.com/recovery-documentary/226360">And, lest we forget, a one-time host of Australia’s classic music TV program, <i>Recovery</i>.)</a></p>
      <p>The man has spent his entire career making low-budget spins on classic horror tropes feel fresh and exciting, and it’s not surprising he’s managed to do the same this time around.</p>
      <p>Basically, we can’t wait till this thing drops in February 2020. Till then, watch the nail-bitingly tense and genuinely horrifying trailer here:</p>
