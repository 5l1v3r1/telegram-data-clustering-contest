      <h1>Child seats in Italy to be fitted with alarms after spate of deaths of children trapped in hot cars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:11:32+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/" target="_blank">Nick Squires</a></address>
      <p>Parents of babies and toddlers will be required to use special alarmed child seats under a new law in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/italy/">Italy</a>, in response to a spate of children dying in cars from extreme heat.</p>
      <p>Parents who fail to buy the alarmed car seats, or buy alarm attachments, face fines of up to €326 and five points being docked from their driving licence.</p>
      <p>If, within two years, a parent is caught again without the special seat, their driving licence will be suspended for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The special car seats work by motion sensor and set off audio alarms and flashing lights if a child is left alone in the car. Devices can also be linked to a parent’s mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Under the law adopted on Thursday, they are now compulsory for all children under the age of four.</p>
      <p>The government has promised to contribute €30 to each family that has to buy the specially-equipped seats, which cost around €100.</p>
      <p>It will operate on a first-come-first-served basis, with warnings that there is unlikely to be enough money for every family in the country.</p>
      <p>The law was introduced in response to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/family-holidays/how-to-protect-babies-and-children-from-the-dangers-of-hot-weather/">cases of babies and children dying in cars</a> after being accidentally forgotten by their parents or carers during the scorching heat of summer.</p>
      <p>It applies not only to Italians but to foreigners visiting the country.</p>
      <p>An Italian road safety group said that parents “need to hurry” to buy the seats or fit alarms to their existing seats, or risk fines and the docking of licence points.</p>
      <p>Aside from car accidents and collisions, heat stroke is the main cause of vehicle-related death for children under the age of 15, according to the American Academy of Paediatrics.</p>
      <p>A small child’s body heats up much faster than that of an adult’s and vital organs start to shut down quicker.</p>
