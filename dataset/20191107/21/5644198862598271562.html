      <p>BEIJING: China will trial in France a new approach to responding to animal disease outbreaks that is less disruptive to trade, and which could be extended across the European Union, European commissioner Phil Hogan said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Hogan, Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development and incoming Trade Commissioner, told Reuters that China's customs authorities had accepted the principle of 'regionalization' for the first time during a meeting on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Under the regionalization concept, only a certain area inside the country where an outbreak has occurred is restricted from exporting the livestock products.</p>
      <p>China, the world's top importer of pork and fastest growing buyer of beef, typically bans imports of animal products from entire countries, even if they have only reported a single outbreak of disease. The bans can take years to be lifted, causing significant damage to trade.</p>
      <p>"This is progress, and they're prepared to do a pilot program with France in relation to putting this into effect in 2020," Hogan said.</p>
      <p>The EU and member states including France have lobbied China for years to recognize regionalization as a way of reducing the impact on trade of disease outbreaks in livestock.</p>
      <p>The principle is applied in the EU for outbreaks of contagious diseases like African swine fever and avian influenza but has never been recognized by China.</p>
      <p>"What the program will say is, if there's a small outbreak of a particular disease in France, it won't mean that the entire country is banned from sending those products into China," added Hogan.</p>
      <p>A list of agreements reached by France and China during President Emmanuel Macron's visit to China this week included a plan for the two countries to carry out technical exchanges with a view to reaching an agreement in 2020 on zoning to combat African swine fever.</p>
      <p>The deadly pig disease, currently ravaging herds across Asia, was also reported in Belgium last year, coming very close to the French border.</p>
      <p>Fresh outbreaks in new countries threaten a booming trade in pork exports to China, where meat imports are expected to rise by around 2 million tonnes, or about 35per cent, this year because of a huge shortfall in production.</p>
      <p>If the project with France goes well, it could be rolled out to all member states, said Hogan.</p>
      <p>"It sets the scene for the concept of regionalization to be applicable all over the European Union for any future disease problems," he said.</p>
      <p>Asked if the EU would recognize the concept in China too, Hogan said: "We're open to the concept of reciprocity on everything, including on animal disease."</p>
