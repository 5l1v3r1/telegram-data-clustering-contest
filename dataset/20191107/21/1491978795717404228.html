      </p>
      <p>Labour’s deputy chairman, Tom Watson, has announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/07/tom-watson-anger-and-regret-over-loss-follow-deputys-resignation">he is stepping down</a> and will not be standing as an MP in the general election. A new deputy will not be chosen until after the election but already some candidates are starting to emerge.</p>

      <p>The MP for Brent South is one of Jeremy Corbyn’s closest allies and is the shadow women and equalities minister. The only person to yet declare, she is thought to have the backing of some of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> leader’s inner circle.</p>
      <h3>Rebecca Long-Bailey</h3>

      <p>The shadow business secretary, former Unite official and a John McDonnell protege, is close friends with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/angela-rayner">Angela Rayner</a> and is trusted by Corbyn’s inner circle with complicated briefs. She is expected to front Labour’s Green New Deal.</p>
      <h3>Jess Phillips</h3>

      <p>Some senior Labour figures are urging the MP for Birmingham Yardley to stand. Phillips, who is a passionate campaigner for women’s rights, would be opposed by many of those close to Corbyn.</p>
      <h3>Angela Rayner</h3>

      <p>The shadow education secretary has been MP for Ashton-under-Lyne since 2015. A one-time teenage mother, her backstory terrifies Conservative opponents and appeals to Labour members.</p>
