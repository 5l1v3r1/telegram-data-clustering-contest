      <p><b>Holden</b> won't move to a <b>seven-year warranty</b> to win back buyers – but it could extend <b>free servicing</b> based on the success of its current offer on the Colorado four-wheel drive ute, and seven-seat Trailblazer and Acadia SUVs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/">Holden</a> boss <b>Dave Buttner</b> said the company has no plans to match <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/kia/">Kia's</a> seven-year, unlimited-kilometre warranty – which has led the industry since October 2014, and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/796513/mitsubishi-inches-closer-to-seven-year-warranty-across-the-range/">could soon be matched by Mitsubishi</a>.</p>
      <p>Although Holden <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/588468/holden-to-roll-out-7-year-175000km-warranty-for-all-new-cars/">experimented with a seven-year warranty</a> across selected models in its range for the last three months of 2017, the promotion had mixed results.</p>
      <p>"The warranty touchpoint with the dealer is not always the most positive experience, because you're going back there because you've got a problem with your vehicle," Mr Buttner told <i>CarAdvice </i>at the launch of <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/805608/holden-monaro-project-monaro/">Project Monaro</a>.</p>
      <p>"Something like a seven-year free service, it's a different kind of offering. And there's ... a couple more brands about to introduce a seven-year warranty, but you've got to look at your budget, your revenue, and look at what you can afford to do on an ongoing basis," he said.</p>

      <p>According to Mr Buttner, customer enquiries about the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/acadia/">Acadia</a>, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/colorado/">Colorado 4x4</a> and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/holden/trailblazer/">Trailblazer</a> are up 40 per cent since the seven years free service offer was launched in October.</p>
      <p>The four-wheel drive Colorado ute was comfortably Holden's best-selling vehicle in October with 1218 examples reported as sold, while the Acadia was the brand's third-best seller with 327 deliveries.</p>
      <p>Although the large SUV segment was down 6.2 per cent year-to-date in 2019, Holden grew sales of the seven-seat Acadia by 61.1 per cent compared to October 2018.</p>

      <p>Mr Buttner said there was more to the seven-year service program than just enticing buyers into the showroom.</p>
      <p>"You give the dealers the opportunity to have another touchpoint with the customer with every free service, and build a relationship," he explained.</p>
      <p>"Then when they get positive equity in the car you can talk about another vehicle, and you get a good used car back, and opportunities to service and finance."</p>
      <p>Although free servicing is something for the "short term", Mr Buttner says Holden is searching for a point-of-difference "that we can have as an always-on type offering over time ... but we haven't really landed on exactly what that'll be yet".</p>

      <p>Holden is enduring a tough 2019. It's down 26.6 per cent year-to-date, and <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/797541/holden-lowest-monthly-sales-since-1948/">suffered its worst month</a> since 1948 in September.</p>
      <p>There are some bright spots, however. Holden's rival to the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/mazda/cx-5/">Mazda CX-5</a>, the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/805822/popular-small-car-sales-plummet/">Equinox</a>, has grown its sales by 9.1 per cent throughout the year, and the ute-based Trailblazer seven-seater is up 7.7 per cent in a declining segment.</p>
