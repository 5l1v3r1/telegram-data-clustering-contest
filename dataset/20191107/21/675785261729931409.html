      <h2>Fallah George, who moved to Australia as a refugee at the age of 10, met his 16-year-old victim in a park in Perth before messaging the girl afterward</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:18:12+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>A dad raped a drunk teenager so badly she had difficulty walking.</p>
      <p>And Fallah George later sent his victim a text message apologising for the vicious sex attack.</p>
      <p>George met his 16-year-old victim when they were drinking alcohol with a group in a park in Perth, Western Australia.</p>
      <p>He asked the girl to walk with him alone before forcing himself on her.</p>
      <p>George pushed the girl against a shed and began kissing her, telling her to "chill" when she tried to make him stop, the WA District Court heard on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Realising her friends had gone, the girl tried to run away, but tripped over, spilling the contents of her handbag.</p>

      <p>George then raped the teen while she lay on the ground, holding his hand over her throat for part of the attack to stop her calling out.</p>
      <p>Judge Linda Petrusa said: "You were concerned only about your own sexual gratification."</p>
      <p>After the attack, George left the girl at a fast-food restaurant where she was picked up by a friend, telling him she wanted her stepmother.</p>
      <p>Sentencing, Petrusa said the girl "couldn't move and had makeup all over her face."</p>
      <p>She added: "She had dirt in her hair and on her clothes, and her knees had blood on them."</p>
      <p>The girl was taken to hospital after the sexual assault in December 2016 but didn't involve police until about four months later.</p>
      <p>In his final message to the girl, George "apologised" for raping her.</p>
      <p>"If I did, I'm sorry, okay? I know sorry won't change anything but please, it won't happen again because it's my mistake and I deeply apologise for my mistake."</p>
      <p>The judge said the girl had been left physically and emotionally hurt and had ongoing night terrors and agoraphobia.</p>
      <p>She had also turned to drugs to comfort herself, the court heard.</p>

      <p>Father-of-one George, who was 20 at the time and moved to Australia as a refugee from Guinea age 10, was found guilty of sexual penetration without consent.</p>
      <p>Having been sentenced to five-and-a-half years behind bars he must serve at least three-and-a-half before he can be eligible for parole.</p>
