      <h2>Climate change is wiping out the sea ice on the Antarctic continent and taking one of Earth's most charismatic creatures with it warns the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T21:15:25+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 21:15</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Henry Goodwin, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Emperor penguins could be wiped out by climate change within 80 years, warns a new study.</p>
      <p>The fate of the birds - some of the most striking and charismatic creatures on Earth - is largely tied to the fate of sea ice which they use as a base for breeding.</p>
      <p>Emperor penguins tend to build their colonies on ice with extremely specific conditions.</p>
      <p>It must be locked in to the shoreline of the Antarctic continent, but close enough to open seawater for the birds to access food for themselves and their young.</p>
      <p>However, as the climate warms, that sea ice will gradually disappear - robbing the birds of their habitat, food sources and ability to hatch chicks.</p>
      <p>Lead author Doctor Stephanie Jenouvrier, a seabird ecologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), said: "If global climate keeps warming at the current rate, we expect emperor in Antarctica to experience an 86 per cent decline by the year 2100.</p>
      <p>"At that point, it is very unlikely for them to bounce back."</p>

      <p>The scientists conducted the study by combining two existing computer models.</p>
      <p>The first, a global climate model created by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), offered projections of where and when sea ice would form under different climate scenarios.</p>
      <p>The other, a model of the penguin population itself, calculated how colonies might react to changes in that ice habitat.</p>
      <p>Dr Jenouvrier said: "We've been developing that penguin model for 10 years.</p>
      <p>"It can give a very detailed account of how sea ice affects the life cycle of emperor penguins, their reproduction, and their mortality.</p>
      <p>"When we feed the results of the NCAR model into it, we can start to see how different global temperature targets may affect the emperor penguin population as a whole."</p>

      <p>The researchers ran the model on three different scenarios.</p>
      <p>First, a future where global temperature only increases by 1.5 degrees Celsius - the goal set out by the Paris climate accord.</p>
      <p>Secondly, one where the temperatures increase by two degrees and, finally, one where no action is taken to reduce climate change, causing a temperature increase of five to six degrees.</p>
      <p>Under the first scenario, the study found that just five per cent of sea ice would be lost by 2100, causing a 19 per cent drop in the number of penguin colonies.</p>
      <p>If the planet warms by two degrees, however, those numbers increase dramatically. The loss of sea ice nearly triples, and more than a third of existing emperor penguin colonies disappear.</p>
      <p>The 'business as usual' is even more dire, Dr Jenouvrier explains, with almost all penguin colonies all but guaranteed.</p>
      <p>She said: "Under that scenario, the penguins will effectively be marching towards extinction over the next century."</p>
      <p>The study, part of an international scientific collaboration, was published in the journal Global Change Biology.</p>
