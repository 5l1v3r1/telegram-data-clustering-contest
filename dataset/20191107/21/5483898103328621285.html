      <h3>Adelaide FC’s new football manager could be announced as early as today, says FIVEaa’s Stephen Rowe.</h3>
      <p>Rowey told FIVEaa Breakfast on Friday:</p>
      <blockquote>“Today could be an announcement day for the Adelaide Crows. We’re hearing they’ve got their man, the GM of football -- I think it’s <a href="https://www.fiveaa.com.au/shows/rowey-bicks/Adelaide-FC-s-Next-Football-Manager-Could-Come-From-The-SANFL">Adam Kelly, SANFL GM of footy</a>.<br/><br/>“Matty Nicks needs to sign it off. Obviously these two are going to deliver that footy program together so a super important role. I’m hearing today. If it’s next week it will be what it is.”</blockquote>
