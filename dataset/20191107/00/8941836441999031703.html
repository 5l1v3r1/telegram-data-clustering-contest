      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration is trying to turn up pressure on three senior <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a> leaders in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>The State Department placed the head of the main <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a> affiliate in Mali on a terrorism blacklist. It also offered rewards for information leading to the location of two top members of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a>’s affiliate in Yemen.</p>
      <p>The sanctions are against Amadou Kouffa for attacks in Africa’s Sahel region. The action announced Thursday freezes any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>A reward of up to $6 million was also offered for information about the emir of Yemen’s Shabwah province for his role in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/al-qaeda/">al-Qaida</a> in the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
