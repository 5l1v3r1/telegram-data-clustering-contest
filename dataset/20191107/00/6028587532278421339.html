      <p><b>Topline: </b>In its second-quarter earnings report, Take-Two Interactive said that the six-year-old <i>Grand Theft Auto 5</i> has reached 115 million units sold-in, continuing the last-gen game’s incredible run.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take-Two Interactive last spring reported the game hit 110 million.</li>
        <li>Rockstar's hit helped Take-Two reach second-quarter profits of $71.8 million on $857.8 million of revenue, the latter of which is up 74% year-over-year but lower than <a href="https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/604746/take-two-ttwo-to-report-q2-earnings-whats-in-the-cards?art_rec=quote-stock_overview-zacks_news-ID03-txt-604746">analyst estimates</a> of $919 million.</li>
        <li>Revenue from in-game spending jumped up 39%, and in particular, Take-Two said <i>Grand Theft Auto Online</i> had its best quarter ever for daily, weekly and monthly active users, with in-game spending increasing 23%.</li>
        <li>Rockstar added a substantial content update in July with “The Diamond Casino &amp; Resort,” which raised eyebrows given the conversations occurring in the industry over what legally constitutes gambling in a game.</li>
        <li>The quarter also featured the launch of loot shooter <i>Borderlands 3</i>, which sold-in 5 million copies in its first five days and has hit 7 million to date.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Big Number: </b>Last year <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-violent-videogame-has-made-more-money-than-any-movie-ever-2018-04-06">it was estimated</a> that <i>Grand Theft Auto 5</i> reached $6 billion in sales, making it one of the most profitable pieces of media ever.</p>
