        <b>UEFA Champions League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Real Madrid 6-0 Galatasaray</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 06 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Santiago Bernabeu</p>
      <p>Real Madrid registered an emphatic 6-0 triumph over Galatasaray in the UEFA Champions League Group A on Wednesday, with 18-year-old Rodrygo netting a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>Luka Modric started from the bench, with Federico Valverde preferred alongside Carlos Casemiro in the middle of the park.</p>
      <p>Real hit the front in just three minutes when Rodrygo brought down a far post-delivery to curl into the bottom corner on his Champions League home debut.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo netted a second in the space of four minutes as he nodded home Marcelo’s pin-point cross from the left side of the area.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos had a third on 14 minutes after a cheeky penalty conversion from Sergio Ramos after the Video Assistant Referee flagged Steven Nzonzi for fouling Toni Kroos.</p>
      <p>Marcelo made way for Ferland Mendy after the Brazilian subsequently encountered a knock four minutes to the break.</p>
      <p>Karim Benzema joined in on the act right before the break when he directed Rodrygo’s low cross into the centre of the area beyond Fernando Muslera.</p>

      <p>Eden Hazard, who up to now endured a quiet evening, went close to snatching a fifth a minute to the break but Muslera smothered the danger following a low strike.</p>
      <p>Control remained strongly with Los Blancos, who had their passing patterns and build-up patterns well within their reach. Modric made an entry on the 60th minute spell in place of Casemiro, as Zinedine Zidane looked to see out the match.</p>
      <p>Real withheld the visitors close to the end, and sealed a fifth nine minutes from time after Benzema tapped home Dani Carvajal’s cross to complete his brace.</p>
      <p>Rodrygo had the final say when he started and finished off a move involving Benzema with a simple slot past Muslera in the final minute of the match to complete his hat-trick,</p>
      <p>Los Blancos as such put their Champions League campaign back on track after a slow start, whist the Turks aspirations end.</p>
