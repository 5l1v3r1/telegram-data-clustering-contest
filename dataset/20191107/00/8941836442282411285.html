      <p>NEW YORK (AP) — T-Mobile promises a new $15 wireless plan if its $26.5 billion Sprint deal goes through.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile is also promising free internet to emergency first responders for 10 years and to low-income households with children for five years. The $15 plan is for anyone, but comes with just 2 gigabytes of data per month.</p>
      <p>Federal regulators have approved the deal.</p>
      <p>But attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia aim to block it, saying it will raise prices for consumers. A trial is to start in December.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile has already made promises to get the deal done, including providing coverage in rural areas and not raising prices for three years.</p>
