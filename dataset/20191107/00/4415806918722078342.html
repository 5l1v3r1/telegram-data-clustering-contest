      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has said training for the Olympic Games was nothing compared with a lifetime preparing to transition.</p>
      <p>The gold medal-winning decathlete achieved athletic glory in 1976, but believes coming out as a trans woman in 2015 was her greatest feat.</p>
      <p>Jenner, 70, said that her Olympic success was loved and appreciated, unlike her transition, which provoked “hatred”.</p>
      <p>The former athlete and reality TV star believes her intense sports training was an attempt to run from her internal problems.</p>
      <blockquote>Everyone loved the Games, a lot of people when they see you transition hate your guts. Look at the quotes on Instagram. By far that was a lot more difficult</blockquote>
      <p>Jenner spoke on BBC Radio 4 podcast Don’t Tell Me The Score about Olympic fame trapping her in a body she doubted.</p>
      <p>She said: “I trained 12 years for the Games. I trained 65 years to transition in 2015. It was harder to do, it was less accepted.</p>
      <p>“Everyone loved the Games, a lot of people when they see you transition hate your guts. Look at the quotes on Instagram. By far that was a lot more difficult.”</p>
      <p>She added on being an Olympian: “A lot of the training was really running away from the issues I had. I remember getting up the next morning, didn’t have a stitch of clothes on, walking to the bathroom, medal sitting there on the table, put the medal around my neck, looking in the mirror and I go, ‘What have you just done? Am I stuck with this person the rest of my life?’ It was scary.”</p>
      <p>Jenner said that the sporting world was very good to her, and provided valuable opportunities.</p>
      <p>Asked her position on trans athletes, she said the Olympic Committee was doing a “good job”, adding that trans people should be able to compete.</p>
      <p>Despite raising considerable sums for trans causes, Jenner said she is not always welcome within the community.</p>
      <p>She said: “A lot of them are extraordinarily appreciative of it. On the other hand, they’re having their big fundraiser and say, ‘Oh please don’t show up, you’re too controversial’.”</p>
      <p>The full interview with Jenner can be heard on Don’t Tell Me The Score, available to listen to on BBC Sounds.</p>
