      <p>BERLIN, Nov 7 — Arsene Wenger is reportedly in talks with Bayern Munich to potentially become their new head coach while Ralf Rangnick, another possible candidate, is said to not be interested.</p>
      <p>Wenger, 70, gave an evasive answer when broadcaster beIn Sports directly asked him about working at Bayern, who dismissed Niko Kovac on Sunday in the wake of a 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>According to German daily <i>Bild</i>, talks have taken place between Wenger and Bayern with club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge leading the search to find Kovac’s replacement.</p>
      <p>Wenger, who speaks fluent German, coached Arsenal from October 1996 until May 2018 and said that he misses some aspects of coaching.</p>
      <p>While Wenger has enjoyed his year away from football, the satisfaction of winning matches and preparing players is “something you miss, of course,” said the Frenchman.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rangnick, currently head of sport and development at Red Bull and the previous sports director at Bundesliga side RB Leipzig, is reportedly the latest big name to turn Bayern down.</p>
      <p>“Ralf is not available. We don’t believe that what Ralf Rangnick is all about is currently being sought by Bayern,” Rangnick’s manager Marc Kosicke told <i>Bild</i>.</p>
      <p>“That why it doesn’t make sense to hold concrete talks.”</p>
      <p>Rangnick joins Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel by stating they will not leave their current jobs this season.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, club president Uli Hoeness said they expected to be able to name a new coach in time for Bayern’s trip to Fortuna Duesseldorf on November 23.</p>
      <p>Former Real Madrid and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and ex-Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri have also been linked to the job by the German media.</p>
      <p>Former Germany assistant coach Hansi Flick took over as interim coach for yesterday's 2-0 Champions League win at home to Olympiakos.</p>
      <p>He will also oversee Saturday’s Bundesliga match against second-placed Dortmund at the Allianz Arena. Bayern are currently fourth in the table.</p>
      <p>Before kick-off yesterday, director of sport Hasan Salihamidzic refused to confirm whether Wenger and Rangnick have been approached.</p>
      <p>“We don’t comment on rumours,” said Salihamidzic.</p>
      <p>However, he revealed Flick could stay on longer as caretaker coach should their preferred candidate only be available next season.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see. I am glad Hansi Flick is here. At the moment he is the right coach.” — AFP</p>
