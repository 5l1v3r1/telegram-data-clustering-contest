      <p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) - A West Virginia judge is looking to the state Supreme Court for guidance after dismissing a case that alleges a Catholic diocese and its former bishop knowingly employed pedophiles.</p>
      <p>Wood County Circuit Court Judge J.D. Beane on Wednesday tossed the suit against the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston until the state Supreme Court decides whether the case violates rules about the separation of church and state.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Patrick Morrisey filed the case in March under the state’s consumer protection act, a move several attorneys said was unprecedented. Morrisey says the diocese covered up arguably criminal behavior and employed admitted sexual abusers without adequate background checks.</p>
