      <p><b>Topline: </b>Billionaire Travis Kalanick’s secretive new food startup, CloudKitchens, quietly raised $400 million from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund—the Saudi’s first known deal in Silicon Valley since the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cia-concludes-saudi-journalist-was-killed-on-the-crown-princes-order-1542412388?mod=article_inline">murder</a> of American journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year caused numerous investors to boycott Saudi funding, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604">reported</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The deal was completed in January and values the company at $5 billion, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604">reported</a>, citing several anonymous sources familiar with the situation.</li>
        <li>The investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund reunites Kalanick with one of his old allies: Yasir al-Rumayyan, the fund’s governor, in 2016 spearheaded a $3.5 billion investment in Uber, and when a group of investors <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/06/21/ubers-travis-kalanick-said-to-resign-as-ceo-amid-investor-backlash/#653bfc9343c8">ousted</a> Kalanick the following year, al-Rumayyan remained a staunch supporter.</li>
        <li>CloudKitchens does away with traditional front-of-house service by creating <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-travis-kalanicks-secret-startup-cloudkitchens-11573122602">commissary kitchens</a> optimized for takeout, which are then rented out to restaurants who want to prepare food exclusively for delivery services.</li>
        <li>The delivery-only food startup buys cheap or rundown properties across the U.S. and elsewhere to build these so-called ghost kitchens; it also operates several of its own delivery-only restaurants.</li>
        <li>Before the Saudi investment, CloudKitchens was funded with $300 million from Kalanick himself—some of which he got from selling Uber shares, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudis-back-travis-kalanicks-new-startup-11573122604">reported</a>.</li>
        <li>Kalanick’s startup may eventually put him in competition with his old company, which is also capitalizing on the booming food-delivery trend with its popular service Uber Eats.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Tangent:</b> Meanwhile, over at Uber, things aren’t looking great. The ride-sharing company’s latest quarterly earnings report was far from stellar, showing losses of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2019/11/04/uber-q3-earnings-revenue-beat-lost-another-billion/#37bc8510306a">over $1 billion</a>. The stock has struggled to gain footing since going public in May, and shares plunged further thanks to the post-IPO lockup period—which prevents early investors from selling shares—<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-shares-face-more-pressure-as-post-ipo-lockup-is-set-to-expire-11573041602">expiring yesterday</a>. Uber stock hit a new low of less than $26 per share, down from its IPO price of $45 per share.</p>
      <p><b>Crucial statistic:</b> Kalanick, who still owns 4% of Uber and remains a director on its board, has a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/travis-kalanick/#233a7ae16199">net worth</a> of $3.2 billion, according to <i>Forbes’ </i>estimates.</p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Kalanick, who founded Uber in 2009, was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-resigns-1498023559?mod=article_inline">ousted</a> as CEO in 2017 after a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-fires-more-than-20-workers-in-harassment-investigation-1496774806?mod=article_inline">series of scandals</a> rocked the ride-sharing company.</p>
