      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>’s lawyers won a courtroom bid Thursday to block a Nevada woman accusing the soccer superstar of raping her in Las Vegas in 2009 from digging into the validity of their 2010 confidentiality agreement and $375,000 hush-money payment.</p>
      <p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel Albregts told <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Kathryn Mayorga</a>’s attorney that it will be up to a higher-level judge to decide if her effort to obtain more money advances to trial or is diverted to closed-door arbitration.</p>
      <p>Albregts, who was named in August to the U.S. District Court, now handles filings and pretrial arguments in a case that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>’s lawyers want dismissed or moved to private talks.</p>
      <p>He said his preliminary review of documents filed under seal in the civil lawsuit before U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey led him to agree with <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>’s lawyers that the records should, at least for now, remain sealed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a>’s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, declined to comment about the ruling.</p>

      <p>The Associated Press generally doesn’t name people who say they’re victims of sexual assault, but <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a> gave consent through her attorneys last year to be identified.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a>, now 36, is a former teacher and model who lives in the Las Vegas area. She says in court documents she met <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a> at a nightclub and went with him and other people to his suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino, where she alleges he assaulted her in a bedroom.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>, through his lawyers, maintains the sex was consensual.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>, 34, of Portugal is one of the richest athletes in the world. He plays in Italy for the Turin-based soccer club Juventus and captains his home country’s national team.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Stovall said in court he wanted communication records between <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a> and the athlete’s attorneys in the U.S. and Portugal ahead of the 2010 settlement to answer questions that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a> now raises about the legality of the contract.</p>
        <p>Her lawyer maintains that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a>, then 25, had learning disabilities as a child, and the records he seeks would show <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>’s legal team knew she was so distraught that she lacked the legal capacity to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a> lawyers Kendelee Works and Peter Christiansen say there is no evidence <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a> was incapacitated or incapable of understanding what she was signing. Works said in court that the existence of the agreement and payment should never have been disclosed publicly.</p>
        <p>Now that it is, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>’s lawyers say the contract calls for out-of-court arbitration to resolve the dispute.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>’s lawyers also maintain that news reports in Europe in 2017 about the settlement and payment were based on electronic data that was illegally hacked, stolen and sold by cybercriminals.</p>
        <p>They say they believe the documents have been altered and complain that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kathryn-mayorga/">Mayorga</a>’s lawsuit is damaging <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cristiano-ronaldo/">Ronaldo</a>’s reputation.</p>
