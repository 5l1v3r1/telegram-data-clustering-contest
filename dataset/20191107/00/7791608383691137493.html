      <p><b>Billie Eilish rocked a</b> new hairstyle at the 2019 LACMA Art + Gala, which she attended with her brother Finneas O’Connell. The <i>Bad Guy</i> singer had neon green roots with a freshly-chopped jet black haircut that resembled a mullet. <br/><b>The 17-year-old was</b> decked in full Gucci gear with matching bejeweled sneakers, a chunky necklace and oversized shades. Fans have lauded the singer for bringing back the 80s look once embodied by legendary icons such as Joan Jett and David Bowie. <br/><b>Amusingly, Eilish was</b> the last person to find out what her hairdo would look like. When asked by a reporter, “All your fans are loving the mullet, are you gonna start a trend now?” A surprised Eilish responded, “Mullet? What you mean, mullet? <br/><b>The musician was completely</b> confused, but laughed it off when she found out that her hairdo was being called a mullet. She then explained that her new hairstyle was a result of a bad dye job. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>“Somebody dyed my</b> hair and burned half of it,” she divulged. “So now it looks like a mullet.” <br/><b>“That s**t is not</b> on purpose though,” she added. The reporter, like many of her fans, encouraged the singer to keep the hairstyle but Eilish was quick to shut it down. “No, I’m growing that s**t out,” she said. <br/><b>It won’t be long</b> before Eilish changes up her hairstyle. So, before it’s gone, let’s appreciate her mullet while we still can. Check out her complete look during the LACMA Art + Gala below.</p>
