      <p>On November 7,<b> Off The Record Entertainment</b> released a curt official statement to various media outlets, announcing that <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/izone">IZ*ONE</a>'s comeback showcase for their upcoming 1st full album '<b>BLOOM*IZ</b>', scheduled for this November 11, has been cancelled. </p>
      <p>The label gave no reasons as to why the showcase was called off, but media outlets primarily coined the ongoing developments in <b>Mnet</b>'s vote rigging controversy surrounding '<b>Produce X 101</b>' and '<b>Produce 48</b>' as decisive factors.</p>
      <p>Earlier on November 6, news outlets reported that<b> Ahn Joon Young</b> PD of the hit 'Produce' series recently admitted to rigging the final votes on Mnet's 'Produce X 101' and 'Produce 48'. The PD denied any vote rigging in previous seasons, including '<b>Produce 101</b>' season 1 and season 2. </p>
      <p>Due to the fact that project girl group IZ*ONE was born directly out of the winning contestants of 'Produce 48', fans have been thrown into a state of chaos in light of the controversy's recent developments, some even announcing their departure from the WIZ*ONE fandom. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, IZ*ONE plan on launching a comeback show via Mnet and <b>M2</b> this November 11, '<b>Comeback: IZ*ONE BLOOM*IZ</b>'. The project group is signed to Off The Record Entertainment until April of 2021. </p>
