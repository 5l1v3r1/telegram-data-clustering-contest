      <p>Dr. Yonatan Stelzer is an expert in the emerging field of epigenetics, which allows interruption of genetic code in many different ways, determining what cells will become. By decoding epigenetics in a normal developmental context, he is hoping to learn how these key processes can go awry, leading to diseases and cancer. Dr. Yonatan Stelzer has always been intrigued by the possibility of using embryonic stem cells to study human genetics and disease.</p>
