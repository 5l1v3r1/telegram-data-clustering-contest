      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - For the second night in a row, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Chicago Bulls</a> took a big lead into the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>This time, they didn’t let up.</p>
      <p>Tomas Satoransky scored a career-high 27 points and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> won for just the third time in nine games with easily their most impressive performance of the young season, routing the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Atlanta Hawks</a> 113-93 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“We were all frustrated by the way the last game went,” said Satoransky, who went 10 of 13 from the field, including 4 of 5 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> built a big lead against LeBron James and the Lakers the night before, only to get outscored 38-19 in the fourth quarter of a 118-112 loss.</p>

      <p>Taking out their frustration on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>, this one was total domination.</p>
      <p>Satoransky had not scored more than nine points this season. He really went off on the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>, beating his previous career best of 25 while also dishing out eight assists.</p>
      <p>Zach LaVine even got a chance to put on his version of Showtime, blocking De’Andre Hunter’s 3-pointer to set up a 360-degree dunk at the other end.</p>
      <p>“We put it together tonight,” Coby White said. “Both halves.”</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Atlanta made a season-low six of 30 attempts from 3-point range, turned it over 24 times and trailed by double digits over the final 41:29.</p>
        <p>“Our guys were not ready,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> coach Lloyd Pierce said bluntly. “We just didn’t care.”</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> took control with a 28-6 run in the opening quarter. Otto Porter Jr. led with way with 10 points, including a couple of 3-pointers. Satoransky chipped in with seven points, Kris Dunn added five and Lauri Markkanen knocked down a 3 to push Chicago to a 30-12 lead.</p>
        <p>Porter went down before halftime with a bruised left foot and did not return.</p>
        <p>He wasn’t needed.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> were up 56-41 at the break, closing the half with a couple of quick passes around the perimeter to set up Satoransky’s 3 from the corner as the buzzer sounded. It was the lowest-scoring first half of the season for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>.</p>
        <p>Chicago stretched the margin as high as 28 points.</p>
        <p>“We played 40 really good minutes last night and that’s not enough,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> coach Jim Boylen said. “They were hurting from the way the game ended last night.”</p>
        <p>Starting his second straight game in place of John Collins, Jabari Parker led the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a> with 18 points. Collins is serving a 25-game suspension after violating the NBA’s doping policy.</p>
        <p>But Pierce wasn’t in the mood to praise anyone.</p>
        <p>“The only positive from this game: It’s over,” the Atlanta coach said. “We don’t have to worry about it anymore.”</p>
        <p>YOUNG STRUGGLES</p>
        <p>It was a miserable night for Atlanta’s Trae Young, on the heels of a dazzling 29-point, 13-assist performance in a victory over San Antonio the previous night.</p>
        <p>The point guard managed just nine points and three assists, missing all eight attempts beyond the arc.</p>
        <p>“Coming off a big win, you’ve got to be mentally focused. You’ve got to approach every game like it’s your last,” Young said. “We didn’t do that.”</p>
        <p>Pierce said the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a> were determined to stop Young after he scored 49 points against them in a game last season.</p>
        <p>“They’re not going to forget that,” Pierce said. “That’s the way they’re going to play Trae every game the rest of his career.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/chicago-bulls/">Bulls</a>: Connected on 13 of 33 from 3-point range. … Markkanen added 17 points, Porter finished with 13 in just 11 minutes, and three other players reached double figures. … Boylen said he won’t have an update on Porter’s condition until the team gets back to Chicago.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/atlanta-hawks/">Hawks</a>: Vince Carter, 42, had a season-high 14 points. … Kevin Huerter, with 12, was the only other Atlanta player in double figures. … Young wasn’t the only player who struggled. Hunter and fellow rookie Cam Reddish combined to go 2 of 15 from the field. “Cam is trying to beat people with his moves,” Pierce said. “You’ve got to beat people with your readiness.”</p>
