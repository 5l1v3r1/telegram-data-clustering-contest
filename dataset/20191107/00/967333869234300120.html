        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): The Nepal government has issued a strong objection over a new political map released by India that places a disputed tract of land lying between both countries within India’s borders.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Placing the <a href="https://kathmandupost.com/national/2019/11/05/even-as-pressure-mounts-oli-administration-remains-silent-over-kalapani">Kalapani region in Nepal’s Darchula district</a> within Indian borders as shown in a new map created by the Indian Home Ministry has ignited a storm in on social media.</p>
      <p>Kalapani, a 35-square kilometer area claimed by both India and Nepal, has been embroiled in controversy since mid-1996, shortly after the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911071077236691-social-media-storm-over-india-placing-nepal-land-within-its-boundaries/%20https://sputniknews.com/asia/201908211076600235-india-nepal-to-discuss-enhanced-trade-economic-cooperation/">ratification of the Mahakali Treaty</a> with India by Nepal’s Parliament.</p>
      <p>A majority of netizens, both of Indian and Nepali origin, have questioned this development.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the foreign ministry of Nepal has made it clear that Kalapani is an integral part of the Himalayan nation. The ministry said that any unilateral actions along the Nepal-India border will be unacceptable to the Nepal government since the foreign secretaries of the two countries have already been assigned by the Nepal-India Joint Commission to find a solution on unresolved border disputes in consultation with border experts.</p>
      <p>A Nepal Parliament committee (State Affairs and Good Governance Committee) is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201910161077064325-timely-project-implementation-geopolitics-key-to-nepal-becoming-chinas-strategic-partner---analyst/">aware of the new map and has demanded an explanation</a> from concerned government ministries.</p>
      <p>Officials from the foreign affairs, home and land reform and management ministries, besides the survey department, are likely to depose before the parliamentary committee on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Indian government released the new political map after it formally split Jammu and Kashmir State into two central government-administered Union Territories on 31 October.</p>
      <p>The 1816 Segauli Treaty between Britain and Nepal provided that the Kali River would mark the western border between<a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911071077236691-social-media-storm-over-india-placing-nepal-land-within-its-boundaries/%20https://sputniknews.com/asia/201906261076052933-indian-tv-channels-off-air-nepal-govts-no-ads-bill/"> India and Nepal</a>. Kalapani lies on its east bank. India asserts that old British surveys and maps show this section to be a part of India. Nepal has staked its claim for all the area east of the Lipu Gad, a rivulet that joins the Kali River on its border.</p>
