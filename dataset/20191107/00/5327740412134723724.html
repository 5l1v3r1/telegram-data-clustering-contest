      <h1>B.C. cop with terminal brain cancer hopes for treatment in the U.S.</h1>
      <h2>Fundraisers planned for Ryan Masales of Abbotsford to cover $200,000 in medical costs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:27:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 00:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.northdeltareporter.com/author/vhopes/" target="_blank">Vikki Hopes</a></address>
      <p>An online fundraiser is underway to help provide medical treatment in the U.S. for an Abbotsford Police officer who is battling terminal brain cancer.</p>
      <p>Ryan Masales – whose nickname is “Chopper” – was diagnosed with an aggressive stage 4 brain tumour in September 2016, and has now exhausted all conventional treatments in Canada, his wife Estelize writes on a GoFundMe page organized to raise $200,000.</p>
      <p>Ryan’s last MRI showed that his cancer is growing, she states.</p>
      <p>His form of cancer – glioblastoma multiforme – is the same one that took the lives of Tragically Hip singer Gord Downie and U.S. senator John McCain.</p>
      <p>Estelize says Ryan’s tumour is of the type that qualifies for a study being performed at the Ivy Brain Tumor Centre in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

      <p>“This means that the treatment there could possibly be extremely effective in treating his deadly condition,” she writes.</p>
      <p>The treatment involves brain surgery, an MRI and several blood labs that are not covered by Canada’s medical services plan and which will cost approximately $200,000 in Canadian funds.</p>

      <p>Estelize said she is determined to raise the money to help save her husband. The couple are parents to a seven-year-old boy, Ryder.</p>
      <p>“Ryan spent his career keeping the community safe, putting his life the line on many occasions to save that of others. Now that he is fighting for his own life, I feel that he deserves the help.”</p>
      <p>Ryan’s policing career includes working for the Abbotsford Police Department, the Vancouver Police Department, the Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit and the BC Undercover Program.</p>
      <p>The online campaign can be found by searching “<a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/fight-chopper">Fight Chopper</a>” at gofundme.com. Money transfers can also be sent to estelize@gmail.com.</p>
      <p>In addition, a fundraiser titled Chopperfest 2019 is planned for Friday, Dec. 6 at 6 p.m. at the Legacy Sports Centre, 3270 Trethewey St. The evening includes music, drinks and a silent auction, and is for adults only.</p>
