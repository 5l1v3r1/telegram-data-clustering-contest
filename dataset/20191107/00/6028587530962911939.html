      <h1>Stunning Desktop Linux OS Deepin v20 Has A Release Date</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Evangelho</a></address>
      <p>Minutes ago I wrapped up an interview with <a href="https://github.com/linuxdeepin">Wuhan Deepin Technology</a> CTO Raphael Zhang and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/10/18/meet-the-linux-desktop-that-will-blow-away-windows-10-and-macos-in-2020/#351572d65c9a">Deepin</a> Development Manager Hualet Wang, and their answers were full of surprises and welcome news. Before I publish the full interview, I wanted to reserve this space for a cool announcement: Deepin v20 is heading into beta status mid-December and is expected to officially launch January 2020.</p>

      <p>Deepin is both a desktop Linux distribution and standalone desktop environment, but the former has been making serious waves lately. Beginning with its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/09/12/huawei-just-started-selling-laptops-with-deepin-linux-pre-installed/#46833a6e7824">recent Huawei partnership</a>, which sees the Chinese device manufacturer shipping various MateBook laptops in China with Deepin preinstalled.</p>
      <p>The Deepin team has also been sharing a series of short but tantalizing Deepin v20 teasers via its YouTube channel. They’re slickly produced, and demonstrate a lot of polish being added to the distribution’s taskbar, launch and login functionality.</p>
      <p>I’ve embedded all three at the bottom of this article (don’t let the language dissuade you; Deepin is also available in English).</p>
      <p>Deepin excites me because it sets such a high bar not just with its visual aesthetic, but with its feature set as well. Tools like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/07/25/the-new-version-of-deepin-linux-has-a-killer-feature-that-every-distribution-needs/#47fc0f535b33">Deepin Cloud Sync</a> (which, yes, will break out of mainland China but not before the company carefully studies various international privacy laws), a window-less slid-out control center and built-in bootloader customization put it a cut above.</p>
      <p>It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but Deepin is the first thing I show people who are unaware of the progress desktop Linux has made in the last several years – not to mention how beautiful it has become.</p>
      <p>Deepin v20 is expected to be based on Debian 10, and the company plans to spend 2020 building its bonds with the international open source community among many other activities.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for information on that front, and a lot more in the upcoming interview.</p>
