      <p>If you think brides and grooms in India spend a lot of time and money in deciding various details of their wedding, including the wedding trousseau, then you have perhaps not come across pictures of NRI couples. Well, Indians living abroad are leaving no stone unturned to get to their roots for their big day and if that means dressing up to the nines, as per the Indian traditions then so be it.</p>
      <p>We came across one such couple living in United Kingdom, who went to the extent of colour-coordinating their wedding outfit, and no prizes for guessing that they looked so regal together.</p>
