      <p><b>Topline</b>: When billionaire Democratic donor Tom Steyer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0pFvLtryd0">launched</a> his 2020 presidential campaign in July, he centered his bid around getting corporate money out of politics because it “rigged the system”—but one of his aides reportedly offered money to local politicians in Iowa in exchange for endorsements, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/4f024bbad09c4e0f97005376f0614377">reported</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The overtures to local politicians in Iowa were made by Pat Murphy, a top adviser for Steyer’s Iowa campaign and a former House speaker in the state.</li>
        <li>None of the politicians offered the money ultimately accepted. One told the Associated Press the offer “left a bad taste in my mouth.”</li>
        <li>In a statement, Murphy said the situation was a “miscommunication.” </li>
        <li>While an exchange never materialized, under campaign finance law such a deal would be legal as long as the payment and endorsement was disclosed. </li>
        <li>In a statement, the Steyer campaign said that Steyer has not made and will not make any individual contributions to candidates in Iowa this year, adding that “the endorsements he receives are earned because of Tom’s campaign message.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: “As a former legislator, I know how tricky the endorsement process can be for folks in Iowa. It was never my intention to make my former colleagues uncomfortable, and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part,” Murphy said in a statement.</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/thomas-steyer/#3c634d573f5b">Steyer</a> founded Farallon Capital in 1986 and turned it into one of the largest hedge fund firms in the country. After stepping back in 2012 to focus on politics and philanthropy, he became a Democratic donor powerhouse, focusing on the environment and, most recently, a campaign to drum up public support for Trump’s impeachment. According to <i>Forbes</i>, Steyer is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2019/07/09/how-tom-steyer-made-his-16-billion-fortune/#297a74a738a9">worth</a> $1.6 billion is mostly self-funding his campaign. </p>
      <p><b>Tangent</b>: Earlier this week, another Steyer aide in South Carolina resigned after stealing volunteer data from Senator Kamala Harris’ campaign, the <i>Post and Courier</i> <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/tom-steyer-aide-stole-kamala-harris-sc-volunteer-data-democratic/article_0daacd98-ff24-11e9-b9c7-87c46a5c6cc9.html">reported</a>.</p>
