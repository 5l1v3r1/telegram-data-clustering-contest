      <p>A woman who claims <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-fallout-ex-mit-staffer-professors-demand-to-know-extent-of-universitys-ties">Jeffrey Epstein</a> paid her to have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/epstein-accuser-virginia-roberts-giuffre-prince-andrew-sex">sex with Britain's Prince Andrew</a> has said in a new interview that the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/personalities/british-royals">second son of Queen Elizabeth II</a> “should go to jail.”</p>
      <p>“Prince Andrew should go to jail,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mitchell-richardson-accused">Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a> says in a <a href="https://twitter.com/60Mins/status/1190939629085585408">teaser for the report </a>that is set to air this Sunday on the Nine Network's “60 Minutes Australia” while standing outside the late convicted pedophile’s sprawling <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/14/jeffrey-epsteins-56m-mansion-could-be-on-the-market-soon/?_ga=2.176688613.1928404743.1573037295-1322177128.1565084573">$56 million Upper East Side mansion</a>.</p>
      <p>“I mean, is he ever going to? Probably not,” adds Giuffre, who now lives in Australia, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/virginia-roberts-giuffre-says-prince-andrew-should-go-to-jail-over-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">The New York Post </a>reported.</p>

      <p>Giuffre says in the speical that Epstein forced her to have sex with “the elite of the world.”</p>
      <p>“I was trafficked to other billionaires. I was trafficked to other politicians,” she told the show. “They should be named and they should be shamed. What they’ve done is horrific.”</p>
      <p>“There wasn’t a part of my body that they did not abuse,” Giuffre added.</p>

      <p>Earlier this week ABC News anchor Amy Robach was caught on a hot mic claiming <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-amy-robach-jeffrey-epstein-hot-mic">network honchos killed a </a>story in 2016that would have explored Giuffre's.</p>
      <p>While many observers feel <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-epstein-clinton-george-stephanopoulos">Epstein’s ties to the Clintons</a> likely resulted in ABC News refusing to air Robach’s reporting, one network insider thinks it’s more probable <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-jeffrey-epstein-prince-andrew-amy-robach">the Disney-owned news organization was simply protecting their chance at access to the British royal family</a>.</p>
      <p>“ABC News has been fawning grotesquely over the royal family for years, desperate for an interview with Kate [Middleton] they will never, ever get. All journalism is greatly subordinate,” the insider told Fox News.</p>
      <p>Epstein’s July 6 arrest drew national attention, including a renewed focus on a deal that allowed him to plead guilty in 2008 to Florida charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution and avoid more serious federal charges.</p>
