      <p>Fox Sports has fired Cris Carter after three years at the network.</p>
      <p>Fox Sports issued a statement Thursday saying Carter was no longer at the network and had no further comment. The Pro Football Hall of Famer had been a co-host of FS1’s “First Things First” morning show since its launch in 2017.</p>
      <p>Carter had not been on the show since Oct. 31, according to The Big Lead.</p>
      <p>Fox hired Carter as an NFL analyst but he was not part of the network’s “Thursday Night Football” or “NFL Sunday” studio shows.</p>
      <p>Carter was part of ESPN’s NFL studio shows from 2008 until early 2016, when the network reshuffled its lineups.</p>
