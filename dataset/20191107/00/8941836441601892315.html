      <p>BALTIMORE (AP) - The number of tourists who visited Maryland last year may have dropped slightly, but a report says they spent more money than in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Economic Impact of Tourism in Maryland report was announced Wednesday at the annual Maryland Tourism and Travel Summit.</p>
      <p>The report says visitors to Maryland spent more than $18 billion last year, up about 2.1% from the previous year.</p>
      <p>Overall visitation decreased from 42.5 million to 41.9 million in 2018, but the decrease was offset by increases in visitor per-trip spending. That was driven by longer stays at more in-state destinations.</p>

        <p>The report says most of Maryland’s visitors came by car. However, the Thurgood Marshall Baltimore-Washington International Airport served a record 27.2 million passengers last year.</p>
