      <h1>Potential McConnell opponent goes off air after complaint</h1>

      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - A Kentucky radio host who is considering a run against U.S. Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mitch-mcconnell/">Mitch McConnell</a> is off the air after Republicans accused him of campaign violations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/matt-jones/">Matt Jones</a>, host of the popular <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kentucky-sports-radio/">Kentucky Sports Radio</a>, was absent from the broadcast Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>He said iHeartMedia, the company that syndicates his show around the state, asked him to stay off the air while he decides whether to run as a Democrat in next year’s U.S. Senate race.</p>
      <p>Fans of Jones’ radio show complained about his absence on social media, and former Kentucky basketball players Karl-Anthony Towns and Dan Issel shared a #freemattjones hashtag on Twitter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mitch-mcconnell/">McConnell</a>’s campaign Twitter account also responded Thursday with a Simpsons cartoon meme that appeared to mock Jones’ political inexperience.</p>

      <p>The state Republican party filed the Federal Election Commission complaint against Jones on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“The complaint is absolute nonsense and very disappointing from someone as powerful as McConnell,” Jones wrote in a blog post. “I have said repeatedly in public and in filings with the FEC that I am not yet a candidate.”</p>
      <p>The complaint alleges Jones is indeed a candidate and is benefiting by using the airwaves to promote himself. Jones says he has not decided whether to run. Jones also has a deal with a publisher to write a book about McConnell, which is due to go on sale in March.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Jones used his radio show to broadcast the statewide tour, which serves to promote both his candidacy and his campaign-related book,” the complaint said.</p>

        <p>The complaint says iHeartMedia was making “in-kind” contributions by airing Jones’ opinions of McConnell on his show.</p>
        <p>Jones said he had hoped to do the show for a couple more weeks then make a decision about running in the 2020 Senate race. Democrat Amy McGrath, who lost a Kentucky congressional race last year, has already filed to run and has raised millions for her campaign.</p>
        <p>“Since I will be making a decision on whether to run very soon, fighting this battle with the Senate majority leader doesn’t make sense,” Jones said.</p>
        <p>McConnell is running for a seventh term.</p>
