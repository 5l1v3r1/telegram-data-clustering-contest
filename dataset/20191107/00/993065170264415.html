      <p>Menzies, who appears opposite Olivia Colman in The Crown, said climate change could make the struggle for clean water worse.</p>
      <p>He is taking part in the Access Denied campaign, which aims to raise £2 million for poor communities worldwide.</p>
      <p>The Game Of Thrones star said: “Having access to clean water and a decent toilet shouldn’t be a luxury.</p>
      <p>“Yet these basic needs are being denied to millions of people around the world affecting the health, education and livelihoods of whole communities.</p>
      <p>“Due to climate change, this situation is set to get even more challenging each year.”</p>
      <p>The actor, who takes on the royal role on the hit Netflix show due to air this month, is joining a charity drive to raise million for clean drinking water.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m proud to become an ambassador for WaterAid, working with them to raise awareness of the urgent need to address this global crisis.”</p>
      <p>Tim Wainwright, the charity’s chief executive, said: “We all have a role to play in making clean water and decent toilets a part of normal life for everyone everywhere by 2030, and Tobias’s support will help us engage more people in this important issue.”</p>
      <p>More information on the upcoming winter campaign can be found at the Water Aid website.</p>
