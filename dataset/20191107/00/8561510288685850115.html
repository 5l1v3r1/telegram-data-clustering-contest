      <h1>First U.S. Study to Use CRISPR to Fight Cancer “Very Promising”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Tangermann</a></address>
      <p>It’s only a preliminary step before such a treatment could be used in human trials, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/health/crispr-cancer-leukemia.html">according to <i>The New York Times</i></a>, but the researchers are optimistic.</p>
      <p>“This treatment is not ready for prime time,” principal investigator Edward Stadtmauter, professor of oncology at the University of Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/11/06/776169331/crispr-approach-to-fighting-cancer-called-promising-in-1st-safety-test">admitted to <i>NPR</i></a>. “But it is definitely very promising.”</p>
      <p>The findings have yet to be peer-reviewed, but the researchers did <a href="https://ash.confex.com/ash/2019/webprogram/Paper122374.html">post them online</a>. The team will be presenting the study at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Orlando, Florida, next month.</p>
      <p>The researchers extracted T-cells — cells that play a critical part in the body’s immune system — from the patients’ blood, and used CRISPR to edit out three specific genes that could stand in the way of their ability to fight cancer.</p>
      <p>“Once we infused these cells, there was anywhere from a 10,000-fold to 100,000-fold increase in the amount of cells growing in the patients, which is exactly what we hoped for,” Stadtmauer told the <i>NYT</i>.</p>
      <p>There’s wide interest in using CRISPR to treat human patients. In July, pharmaceutical companies Editas Medicine and Allergan <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/human-gene-editing-trial-crispr-treat-blindness">announced</a> <a href="http://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/allergan-and-editas-medicine-initiate-brilliance-phase-12">that it’s</a> planning to use CRISPR to treat an eye disorder that causes blindness.</p>
      <p>“It really just opens up a whole world of this type of manipulation of cells to be directed to whatever the imagination can think of,” Stadtmauer told the <i>Times</i>.</p>
