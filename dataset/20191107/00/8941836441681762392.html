      <h1>NBA: Leonard not healthy so Clippers allowed to rest him</h1>

      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Kawhi Leonard isn’t healthy three weeks into the season, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a>, which says that as a result the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Los Angeles Clippers</a> can rest their new superstar.</p>
      <p>He was on the bench against the visiting Milwaukee Bucks for a national TV game Wednesday night, the first half of a back-to-back for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>. They host Portland on Thursday night, and coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doc-rivers/">Doc Rivers</a> said Leonard would play.</p>
      <p>“Kawhi Leonard is not a healthy player under the league’s resting policy,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a> spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement Wednesday. “And, as such, is listed as managing a knee injury in the LA <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a> injury report. The league office, in consultation with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a>’s director of sports medicine is comfortable with the team medical staff’s determination that Leonard is not sufficiently healthy to play in back-to-back games at this time.”</p>
      <p>While not disputing the league’s comments, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doc-rivers/">Rivers</a> also said Leonard “feels great.”</p>
      <p>“But he feels great because of what we’ve been doing and we’re just going to continue to do it,” the coach said. “There’s no concern here.”</p>

      <p>Last week, Leonard missed a road-home back-to-back against Utah and San Antonio. Rivers said it doesn’t mean that Leonard won’t play in back-to-backs - the team has 11 remaining this season - but “early on we’re going to keep to the same plan that we’ve kept to so far.”</p>
      <p>Added Montrezl Harrell, “He’s got to take care of his body like every other player on this team.”</p>
      <p>Rivers cited “a lot of minutes” that Leonard racked up last season while leading Toronto to its first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a> championship.</p>
      <p>“I think Kawhi made a statement that he’s never felt better,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doc-rivers/">Rivers</a> said. “It’s our job to make sure he stays that way.”</p>

        <p>Leonard is averaging career highs in points (29.3), rebounds (7.3), assists (5.7), steals (2.3) and blocks (1.0) in six games so far this season, while averaging 30.5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Paul George, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>‘ other big acquisition during the summer, is still rehabbing from offseason shoulder surgery. He is expected to participate in contact at practice soon.</p>
        <p>“You could see he’s very eager. He tried to sneak in one possession unsuccessfully,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/doc-rivers/">Rivers</a> said. “He wants to play.”</p>
        <p>Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said Milwaukee manages reigning <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-basketball-association/">NBA</a> MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in a similar way to Leonard.</p>
        <p>“We’re very conscientious of how we can keep him healthy and how we can keep him playing well, being proactive, being aggressive,” he said. “It’s not just the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/los-angeles-clippers/">Clippers</a>. A lot of teams are considering and doing things to make sure their whole roster is healthy.”</p>
