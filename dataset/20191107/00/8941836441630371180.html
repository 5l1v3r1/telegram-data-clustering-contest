      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - A Harvard law professor says a woman who went public with claims she was a teenage victim of Jeffrey Epstein and then sued him has damaged his reputation, business and health.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-dershowitz/">Alan Dershowitz</a> described his anguish in a defamation counterclaim filed Thursday in Manhattan federal court against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/virginia-roberts-giuffre/">Virginia Roberts Giuffre</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/virginia-roberts-giuffre/">Giuffre</a> has said Epstein trafficked her to several prominent men, including <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-dershowitz/">Dershowitz</a>. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alan-dershowitz/">Dershowitz</a> says it never happened and she has fabricated allegations and “far-fetched stories” against others.</p>
      <p>He says he has travel records, credit card statements and phone records proving he was never in places when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/virginia-roberts-giuffre/">Giuffre</a> claims to have had sex with him.</p>
      <p>He says the false claims have led him to suffer severe emotion distress, including “cardiac conditions.”</p>
