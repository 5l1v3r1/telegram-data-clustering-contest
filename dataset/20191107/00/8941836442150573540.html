      <p>BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) - Former Penn State assistant football coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-sandusky/">Jerry Sandusky</a>’s resentencing on a 45-count child sexual abuse conviction is being delayed another two weeks.</p>
      <p>Judge Maureen Skerda on Thursday pushed the hearing back to 1 p.m. Friday, Nov. 22, at the county courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.</p>
      <p>Skerda acted after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-sandusky/">Sandusky</a>’s defense lawyer and prosecutors filed a joint request. They said they need a little more time to prepare for argument about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-sandusky/">Sandusky</a>’s designation as a sexually violent predator, among other things.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-sandusky/">Sandusky</a> is expected to be the courtroom.</p>
      <p>State Superior Court turned down much of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jerry-sandusky/">Sandusky</a>’s appeal in February but determined that mandatory minimum sentences had been misapplied after this 2012 trial, so a new sentencing is needed.</p>
