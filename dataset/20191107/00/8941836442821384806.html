      <p>Also, five Lazio fans were stopped for possession of dangerous materials such as baseball bats and knives at an event featuring fans of both clubs.</p>

      <p>One end of Lazio’s stadium will be closed for the match as punishment by UEFA for racist incidents at a previous game against Rennes.</p>
      <p>UEFA also opened disciplinary cases against Celtic and Lazio after fans traded anti-fascist and fascist gestures during Celtic’s 2-1 win in Glasgow last month.</p>
