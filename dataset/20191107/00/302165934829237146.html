      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 7 — My Chemical Romance revealed the end of their six-year hiatus from music last month, also announcing a first reunion concert at Los Angeles’ Shrine Expo Hall on December 20.</p>
      <p>The alternative rock band ceased to exist in 2013 when frontman Gerard Way alerted fans, “My Chemical Romance is done”.</p>
      <p>“But it can never die. It is alive in me, in the guys, and it is alive inside all of you. I always knew that, and I think you did too. Because it is not a band-it is an idea,” he wrote in a statement.</p>
      <p>Rumors that the <i>Bulletproof Heart</i> rockers were reuniting arose earlier this year when Joe Jonas revealed in an interview that the Jonas Brothers spotted the band rehearsing in New York City.</p>
      <p>Although My Chemical Romance first denied any reunion plans, the musicians refreshed their social media accounts with new images over the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>As their forthcoming concert in Los Angeles sold out almost immediately, the band has announced four more shows for 2020.</p>
      <p>My Chemical Romance will notably perform as part of the Download festival in Melbourne, Australia, from March 20 to 21, and in Japan on March 29.</p>

      <p>My Chemical Romance unveiled their last opus, entitled <i>Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Kiljoys</i>, in November 2010.</p>
      <p>They later released the single <i>Fake Your Death</i> in 2014, as part of the compilation <b>May Death Never Stop You</b>.</p>
      <p>Since the band’s split, Way has mainly focused on his comic book work with his critically-acclaimed graphic novel, <i>The Umbrella Academy</i>, being adapted as a Netflix series last February. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
