      <p>BEREA, Ohio (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kareem-hunt/">Kareem Hunt</a> can play again after serving his eight-game <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> suspension.</p>
      <p>The Cleveland Browns running back, who fell from one of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a>’s rising young stars to a violent offender, will play this week against the Buffalo Bills.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kareem-hunt/">Hunt</a> has been practicing for two weeks. He was officially reinstated to the roster this week and is eligible to be on the field Sunday. It will be his first game since being banned for two physical off-field altercations.</p>
      <p>The Browns signed him in February, two months after <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kareem-hunt/">Hunt</a> was cut by the Kansas City Chiefs. The Chiefs said he lied to them about an incident in which he shoved and kicked a woman during an argument.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old Cleveland native is scheduled to speak to the media Thursday for the first time since the season began.</p>
