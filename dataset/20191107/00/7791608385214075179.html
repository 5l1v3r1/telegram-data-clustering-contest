      <h1>Sony Ropes In The Onion To Produce Fake News Podcast For ‘Presumably Illiterate’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Thanussha Priyah</a></address>
      <p><b><i><a href="https://www.theonion.com/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">The Onion</a></i> has</b> been posting satirical news on its (fake) news site for years, crafting out content that is ever outrageous and refreshing. Now, readers of the parody news site can enjoy listening to the content they love through a brand new podcast launched by Sony Music Entertainment. <br/><b>The music company</b> is teaming up with <i>The Onion</i> for a daily satirical podcast called <i>The Topical</i>. The program, which will focus on current events, will be launched in January 2020. <br/><b>The news site</b> is known to be filled with ridiculously sarcastic news content with bizarre headlines such as, “‘Someone’s In Here!’ Says Man In Restroom Asserting Own Existence For First Time In Months,” and “Man Starting To Think Addams Family Not Like Other Families.” <br/><b>Now, Sony will back up</b> the news site with content creation, marketing and financing of new technology, while the creative aspect such as writing, producing and recording will come solely from the news site. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>Managing editor of</b> <i>The Onion</i> Joran LaFlure humorously shared that the daily news podcast will enable the site to reach out and inform “presumably illiterate people previously deprived of the finest reporting the world has ever known.” <br/><b>The recent wave of</b> podcasting has led Sony to partner up with podcast producer Renay Richardson to create <a href="https://www.broccolicontent.com/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Broccoli Content</a>. The joint venture is a podcast production company, which will bring forth new podcasts from various genres and subjects. </p>
