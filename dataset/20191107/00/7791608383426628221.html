      <p><b>“World’s largest statue”</b> of Jesus Christ based in Świebodzin, Poland has now been equipped with an antenna assembly in its crown. <br/><b>It can now</b> distribute internet signals, thanks to an order by the parish priest in the same area, the one who also called for the building of the monument, per <a href="https://www.slavorum.org/worlds-largest-jesus-christ-statue-from-poland-began-distributing-internet-from-antennas-in-his-crown/?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI"><i>Slavorum</i></a> <br/><b>The community</b> itself is purportedly not aware of the development, while the internet provider has stated that the priest wanted internet distribution to “monitor in the parish.” <br/><b>To capture</b> a clearer picture of the statue’s crown, journalists had to deploy a drone, revealing images of visible antennas within the statue’s crown. <br/><a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <a href="https://designtaxi.com/notice.html?utm_source=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_medium=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_term=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_content=DesignTAXI&amp;utm_campaign=DesignTAXI">Advertisement</a> <br/><b>The representative</b> from the internet provider stated that the “video surveillance system” was agreed upon by the locals, but did not provide details from the contract. <br/><b>Meanwhile, the church</b> did not give any comments to journalists. The antennas were found to be able to distribute the internet effectively due to the height of the statue. The whole statue, from the bottom to the top of Christ’s crown, measures up to 52.5 meters (172 feet) altogether. <br/><b>It is unclear</b> how the locals are reacting to their internet browsing sessions being received by the statue of the Lord.</p>
