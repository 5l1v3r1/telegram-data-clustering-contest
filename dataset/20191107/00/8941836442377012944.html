      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hall of Famer <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tina-thompson/">Tina Thompson</a> will be honored at Southern California when her jersey is retired this weekend.</p>
      <p>A ceremony will be held Saturday before the Trojans host <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tina-thompson/">Thompson</a>’s Virginia team at Galen Center, where her No. 14 jersey will be hoisted.</p>
      <p>Former USC assistant Fred Williams will be in attendance along with several of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tina-thompson/">Thompson</a>’s former teammates.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tina-thompson/">Thompson</a> joins former USC stars Cynthia Cooper, Lisa Leslie, Pam McGee, Paula McGee and Cheryl Miller in having their jerseys retired.</p>
      <p>The last time Virginia and USC met <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/tina-thompson/">Thompson</a> was starring for the Trojans in 1993 and ‘95. She remains the school’s fifth all-time leading scorer and rebounder.</p>
