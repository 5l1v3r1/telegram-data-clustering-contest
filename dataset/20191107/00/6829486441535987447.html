      <h1>Everyone Hates The Shitty, Cheap Flounder From ‘The Little Mermaid Live!’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T00:13:28+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 00:13</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Rennex</a></address>
      <p>In celebration of 30 years since we were blessed with <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, even though we didn’t ask, ABC gave us the musical television event, <i>The Little Mermaid Live!</i></p>
      <p>Not to be confused with the highly-anticipated <a href="https://junkee.com/ariel-little-mermaid/212248">live-action film adaptation</a> of the original, the TV special was filmed in front of a live audience and broadcast last night in the US.</p>

      <p>Boasting an impressive cast including the likes of Queen Latifah as Ursula, Auli’I Cravalho as Ariel and Shaggy as Sebastian, the <a href="https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/11/flounder-the-little-mermaid-live/">question on everyones lips</a> was who would play Flounder. If you’ve ever watched <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, you know what an integral part of the story he plays as Ariels best fish friend.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for everyone, no one played Flounder. Instead the decision was made that Flounder would be <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4eMOd7DiJx/?utm_source=ig_embed">a puppet</a> controlled by three different puppeteers.</p>
      <p>Making his appearance in the iconic ‘Part of Your World’ scene, Flounders appearance shocked everyone. The demonic flounder is featured at 2.50 onwards, if your eyes can handle it.</p>

      <p>In the comments of the video, viewers couldn’t even focus on Auli’I’s vocals because they were so distracted by Flounders kid’s art project-style appearance.</p>

      <p>The reception on Twitter wasn’t all that warm either, with people questioning why Flounder looked so cheap, and well, that damn scary.</p>

      <p>The disappointment only continued <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO0HfBGTGOg">once Shaggy took stage</a> as Sebastian the crab. Dressed in red jeans, a red jacket, red shoes and no claws, one YouTube user described as the outfit as “the ‘Thriller’ uniform.” The sentiments continued onto Twitter where others expressed their confusion.</p>

      <p>Well… here’s hoping for a little more in the costume and props department with the live-action film.</p>
