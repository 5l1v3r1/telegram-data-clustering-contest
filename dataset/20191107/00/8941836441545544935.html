      <p>ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Archaeologists excavating a vast 3,300-year-old fortress northwest of Athens are hoping to shed light on one of the most impressive engineering feats of ancient Greece.</p>
      <p>The Culture Ministry says the results of work at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/glas/">Glas</a>, a low, flat hill commanding a sprawling plain, have been “particularly encouraging,” revealing meticulously planned building complexes of an uncanny uniformity unknown in other contemporary sites.</p>
      <p>For most of its history the plain was a lake surrounded by swamps. It was only fully drained in 1931. But for a brief period in the 13th century B.C., local rulers changed the river courses and built huge dikes to create thousands of acres of farmland.</p>
