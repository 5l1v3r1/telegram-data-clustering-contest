      <p>"Factors including the global trade situation, monetary policies of major countries and prospects concerning Brexit led to a drop in the US dollar index and lower bond prices of major countries," said Wang.</p>
      <p>Despite mounting external uncertainties, the Chinese economy has maintained overall stability and posted stable growth with an improved economic structure, Wang said, citing balanced supply and demand in the forex market and the firm growth of forex reserves.</p>
      <p>China's strong economic fundamentals and continuous reform and opening-up will help the country to tackle risks and challenges and provide a solid foundation for the forex reserves to remain generally stable, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Wang as saying.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php"><b>Special Thursday Expiry on <s>10<sup>th</sup></s> 7<sup>th</sup> Nov</b><br/>Early Closure to The Great Diwali Discount.
