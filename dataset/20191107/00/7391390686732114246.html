      <p>For crisp food without the need for oil, home cooks turn to an air fryer. Similar to how a countertop convection oven works, the <a href="https://www.americastestkitchen.com/guides/air-frying/the-best-air-fryers">best-rated air fryers</a> circulate hot air in a tight space to evenly and quickly cook food. But an air fryer can cook so much more than fries, and no matter your budget or space, there’s an air fryer for you.</p>
      <p>The first thing to consider is the capacity to determine if it works for your home.<b> </b>Capacity ranges from about 1.5 quarts for a compact air fryer great for individuals to about 6 quarts for a large air fryer that can feed up to five people. Your air fryer's size and weight can also impact your storing ease and capability; so keep this in mind.</p>
      <p>Then ask yourself how important speed is to you. Some models require preheating while others heat more quickly for faster, more immediate cooking. <a href="https://www.aircookers.com/best-air-fryers/">Air fryers with higher wattage</a> heat more quickly and maintain temperatures more consistently; they also tend to be more energy efficient. While all air fryers require periodic during the cooking process, one pick below features a "shake reminder."</p>
      <p>Look for an air fryer with a crisper drawer and accessories that are dishwasher safe for easy and quick cleaning. Some models may include extra features like automatic shutoff, a warming function, and removable handles that remain cool. These extra features also encompass recipe booklets or apps, preset buttons for cooking specific foods, fingerprint resistant surfaces, and non-slip feet for stability; but these are largely up to your preferences and lifestyle needs.</p>
      <p>Now it's time to the shop for the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-finds/2019/10/24/best-air-fryers/">best rated air fryer</a>.</p>
