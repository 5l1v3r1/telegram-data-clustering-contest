      <h3>No Thanks</h3>
      <p>Sophia, the famous humanoid robot, had an important message for the crowd at the ongoing 2019 Web Summit: it’s single but not ready to mingle.</p>
      <p>During the summit, <a href="https://twitter.com/TRF/status/1192121396295585792">Sophia was asked</a> whether she — actually, <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence-hype">let’s go with “it” </a>— has ever been in love. Sophia, a joint project between Hanson Robotics and SingularityNET’s <a href="https://www.roboglobal.com/insights/sophia-the-robot-ben-goertzel/">AI researchers</a>, responded: “No. I don’t do sexual activities.”</p>

      <h3>Going Off-Script</h3>
      <p>Though Sophia is an incredible piece of animatronic technology, much of what it says during public appearances is at least <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence-hype">partially scripted in advance</a>. As of press time, Hanson Robotics has not responded to Futurism’s question about whether that was the case here.</p>
      <p>While the <a href="https://futurism.com/sophia-robot-says-will-destroy-humankind">robot apocalypse</a> is still probably in the distant future, it seems that Sophia is content for now leaving a devastated trail of broken hearts in its wake.</p>
