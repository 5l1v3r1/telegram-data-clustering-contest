      <p>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Pavel Buchnevich had a goal and an assist, Henrik Lundqvist made a season-high 45 saves and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">New York Rangers</a> beat the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carolina-hurricanes/">Carolina Hurricanes</a> 4-2 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Artemi Panarin, Brendan Lemieux and Adam Fox also scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/new-york-rangers/">Rangers</a>, who have won 28 of their past 34 games against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carolina-hurricanes/">Hurricanes</a>. Lundqvist got his 31st career victory over Carolina, including 22 in his last 26 starts.</p>
      <p>Dougie Hamilton and Sebastian Aho scored for the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carolina-hurricanes/">Hurricanes</a>, who had a 47-to-18 shot advantage, including 22 to 6 in the first period.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/carolina-hurricanes/">Hurricanes</a> dominated early but couldn’t get a shot past Lundqvist. Panarin scored off a pass from Ryan Strome with 27.5 seconds left in the first for a 1-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Carolina tied it at 14:32 in the second with a tip-in by Hamilton off a deep shot from Jaccob Slavin.</p>
