      <p>LONDON (AP) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s technology adviser warned Thursday about China exporting authoritarianism globally in parallel with its rise as a tech power.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-kratsios/">Michael Kratsios</a>, the U.S. chief technology officer, told a major technology conference, “if we don’t act now, Chinese influence and control of technology will not only undermine the freedoms of their own citizens, but all citizens of the world.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-kratsios/">Kratsios</a>’s speech at Portugal’s Web Summit was the latest salvo in the U.S.-China battle for global tech dominance.</p>
      <p>He claimed that while the U.S. and its allies have been cooperating to develop technology for good, China’s government “continues extending its authoritarianism abroad,” and specifically cited tech giant Huawei.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has been lobbying allies to shun Huawei, which it says can be forced under a national security law to facilitate Chinese cyberespionage, though the company has repeatedly denied the allegations.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-kratsios/">Kratsios</a> said that despite the risks, Western businesses are still considering “opening their arms to Chinese companies” to build next generation mobile networks and develop key technologies like artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>Huawei rejected what it called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-kratsios/">Kratsios</a>‘ “false claims.”</p>

        <p>“Cybersecurity and privacy protection are and will remain Huawei’s top priorities,” the company said in a statement.</p>
