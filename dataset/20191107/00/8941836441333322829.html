      <p>ATLANTA (AP) - A nonpartisan organization has placed a national debt clock in downtown Atlanta, right on time for a Democratic presidential debate coming to the city in two weeks.</p>
      <p>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports New York-based Peter G. Peterson Foundation placed the billboard on Ted Turner Drive between Walton and Marietta streets, near Centennial Olympic Park.</p>
      <p>The clock displays the nation’s nearly $23 trillion debt and pegs each American’s share of the number at about $68,000.</p>
      <p>CEO Michael A. Peterson says the debt issue affects everyone not just lawmakers. He says he hopes the billboard sparks conversation on the enormous debt and ways to manage it.</p>
      <p>The foundation says the clock will remain in the city indefinitely.</p>
