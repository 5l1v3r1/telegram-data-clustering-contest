      <p>CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo. (AP) - A woman who was having an affair with a Colorado man charged in the beating death of his fiancee said Thursday she helped clean up the bloody aftermath before he burned the body, while the defense raised doubts about whether he truly had so much power over her to maintain her silence and cooperation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee/">Krystal Lee</a> testified for a second day in the trial of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Patrick Frazee</a>, who has denied killing <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Kelsey Berreth</a> at her townhome in Woodland Park, a mountain community of 7,500 people about two hours south of Denver.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a> was last seen nearly a year ago near her home, and no sign of her body has been found.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee/">Lee</a>, who worked as a nurse in Idaho, said she grabbed several blood-spattered items from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s home to be burned, including a stuffed animal, children’s building blocks and what she thought was a Bible, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette . She also testified that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s baby daughter was in the home when the blindfolded mother was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors showed jurors a video of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee/">Lee</a> leading investigators to the spot where <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> allegedly burned <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s body.</p>

      <p>Standing in a clear patch of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a>’s central Colorado ranch, surrounded by pine trees, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee/">Lee</a> described <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> putting the body in a dry water trough and lighting it on fire. At one point, she said, flames were as high as the nearby trees, so <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> covered the blaze with what appeared to be metal roofing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee/">Lee</a> struck a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty in February to evidence tampering, acknowledging she took <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>’s phone to Idaho at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a>’s request to make it look like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a> had left the state.</p>
      <p>Defense attorney Adam Steigerwald seized on that deal and repeatedly asked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/krystal-lee/">Lee</a> if she was aware that she could be facing life in prison if she didn’t accept it and cooperate with investigators. He also questioned whether she has been fully truthful during her 10 hours of testimony, KOAA-TV reported.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have not offered a motive for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> to kill <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/kelsey-berreth/">Berreth</a>, but her parents argue in a wrongful death lawsuit that they believe he wanted full custody of the couple’s daughter.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patrick-frazee/">Frazee</a> would be sentenced to life in prison without parole if he is convicted of first-degree murder.</p>
