      <p>Juli Briskman, who <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/biker-who-flipped-trump-off-fired">lost her job</a> over a viral photo of her flipping off President Donald Trump’s motorcade in 2017, made an unexpected comeback after Virginia’s elections on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Briskman won her bid for supervisor on Virginia’s Loudoun County Board of Supervisors against Republican incumbent Suzanne Volpe. She will represent Loudoun County’s Algonkian District.</p>
      <p>“It’s feeling fantastic, it’s feeling surreal,” the Democrat told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginia-cyclist-who-flipped-off-trump-wins-loudoun-county-seat-representing-his-golf-club/2019/11/05/e8aa11dc-003d-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html">Washington Post</a>. “The last two years have been quite a ride. Now we’re helping to flip Loudoun blue.”</p>
      <p>Briskman caught the nation’s eye in 2017 when a White House photographer captured her giving Trump’s motorcade the middle finger as she was bicycling in Sterling, Virginia. She was then fired from her post at Akima, a federal contracting firm, after she posted the photo on social media.</p>
      <p>“I’d do it again,” Briskman said at the time after her ouster.</p>
