      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - The U.S. Navy says it is considering a new plan to use double-wall tanks to upgrade a fuel storage facility in Honolulu.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/hawaii-public-radio/">Hawaii Public Radio</a> reported Thursday that the Navy updated its initial proposal to reinforce tanks at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility.</p>
      <p>The Navy says if the upgrade cannot be completed it will relocate the fuel in the facility’s 20 tanks beneath the Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer.</p>
      <p>A 2014 leak of 27,000 gallons (102,203 liters) of fuel at the facility threatened Oahu’s drinking water and prompted calls for improvements.</p>
      <p>The Navy’s Sept. 9 proposal had favored single-wall tank upgrades with added monitoring features.</p>

      <p>The plan was rejected by a Honolulu City Council committee last month and was opposed by the Board of Water Supply.</p>
