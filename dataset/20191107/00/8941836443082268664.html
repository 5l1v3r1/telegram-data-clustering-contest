      <p>NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - A New Jersey man is not going to prison for orchestrating a slip and fall insurance scam.</p>
      <p>Under terms of a plea agreement, a judge on Monday instead sentenced 58-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexander-goldinsky/">Alexander Goldinsky</a> to probation, community service and ordered him to pay $563.48 in restitution to an insurance company.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexander-goldinsky/">Goldinsky</a> had pleaded guilty to insurance fraud.</p>
      <p>Middlesex County prosecutors say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexander-goldinsky/">Goldinsky</a> was an independent contractor working at a company in Woodbridge in 2018 when he threw ice on the floor in the cafeteria and laid down until he was discovered. He sought medical treatment claiming he had a head injury.</p>
