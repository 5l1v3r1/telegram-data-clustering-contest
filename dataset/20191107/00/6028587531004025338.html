      <p><b>Topline</b>: An Arkansas poultry supplier is recalling around 2 million pounds of chicken that may be contaminated with metal, the Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has said.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simmons Prepared Foods, based in Gentry, Arkansas, recalled 13 different ready-to-cook chicken products, including whole chicken, chicken wings and halal chicken leg quarters.</li>
        <li>It is a Class 1 recall, meaning there is “reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death,” the FSIS said.</li>
        <li>The affected products are said to have been produced from October 21, 2019, through November 4, 2019, and were shipped to Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. Affected products found in freezers should also be thrown away, the FSIS said.</li>
        <li>You can view the complete list of recalled products <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/4c5f6e63-9170-4c96-b871-5fa1decde7b3/108-2019-products-list.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">here</a>.</li>
        <li>There have not yet been any reports of adverse reactions from consuming the affected products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: Simmons <a href="https://simmonsfoods.com/company-news/2019/11/6/voluntary-recall-of-simmons-chicken-products">said</a> in a statement: “Food safety is a very serious matter at Simmons. That is why Simmons has issued a precautionary and voluntary recall of approximately 2 million pounds of fresh and frozen chicken products due to the potential to contain extraneous material, specifically metal. ... This issue was discovered through Simmons’ standard food safety and quality checks.”</p>
