        <b>Technical View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nifty formed a Dragon Fly Doji formation on daily charts</p>
      <p>It took support near its 5-Days EMA at 11,941 before bouncing back</p>
      <p>5-Days EMA has been acting as crucial support for the index since 11 October</p>
      <p>Nifty may retest record high in the coming session</p>
      <p>Contrary to this, a close below 11,946 levels can bring back bears back into the game</p>
      <p>If the index manages to sustain above 12,021, we may see good recovery towards 12,100-12,200 in the near term,</p>
