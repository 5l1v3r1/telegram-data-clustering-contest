      <p>John Hoskins, 32, who was a coach at Knightdale High School in Knightdale, North Carolina, was caught at a bar yelling, “White power, Knightdale! I still love you n****s!” Hoskins was celebrating his team’s victory over Corinth Holders High School. The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201910231077122202-photos-us-mayoral-race-sees-candidate-target-incumbent-with-racist-political-ad/">incident</a> was captured on Instagram Live by a bystander. The video was later deleted from Instagram but not before it was reported to school administrators. </p>

      <blockquote>"Fifteen seconds of fame in the wrong way. I've ruined the last 12 years of my career," John Hoskins told <a href="https://abc11.com/society/im-not-racist-instagram-video-shows-wake-co-coach-using-n-word/5674327/">ABC11</a> on Tuesday in an exclusive interview.</blockquote>
      <p>"Just to set the record, I'm not <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911051077225343-us-restaurant-sacks-managers-for-harassing-black-party-at-racist-regulars-request/">racist</a>," Hoskins told ABC11. "I don't mean it in a negative way,” also adding that his black friends have told him over the years that he can use the N-word.</p>
      <p>"I guess I've been around them for so long. We're friends. I mean nothing from it," he said. "The word can be used in multiple ways. They treat me as any of their own friends."</p>
      <p>He also noted that the athletes on the team also say it’s OK for him to use the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911011077198261-halloween-in-2019-sheffield-university-bans-dressing-up-in-sombreros-because-they-are-racist/">N-word</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>"They joke around. We joke around. They walk up to me and say it. 'Hey coach, just say it. You're a good coach. Just say it.' Once in a while, it slips," he said. "Once a year, it slips. To have them smile and laugh. Besides that, I mean nothing from it."</blockquote>

      <p>​Hoskins chose to leave his post at the school, submitting a one-sentence resignation letter that has since surfaced on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Wake County School District Superintendent Cathy Moore has expressed disappointment over Hoskins’ language.</p>
      <blockquote>"The language, the context is not okay. And unfortunately, social media will show you a piece of something but not all of something. And this man is an adult. And he should know better," she said in a comment to ABC11, adding that Hoskins’ language violated the school district’s code of conduct.</blockquote>
      <p>The Wake County Public School System did not immediately respond to Sputnik’s request for comment.</p>
