      <p>Even though cannabis edibles are legal, police are reminding the public there are limits.</p>
      <p>“Cannabis and edibles are now legal in Canada, but there are limits to the amount a person can lawfully possess,” said Inspector Mike Hall, the RCMP’s proactive enforcement officer.</p>

      <p>“Anyone trafficking cannabis products unlawfully may be charged under the Cannabis Act.”</p>
      <p>His comments come after an 18-year-old man was arrested and released after being stopped by police in Cloverdale Oct. 30.</p>
      <p>The teenager had more than 30 grams of cannabis edibles and cannabis vape products on him at the time, which is over the legally-allowed limit.</p>
      <p>The Surrey Gang Enforcement Team stopped the youth at the intersection of Fraser Highway and 64th Avenue.</p>
      <p>Police say no charges have been laid yet.</p>
      <p>“We want parents to see the photos of the cannabis edibles, to be aware that they can look similar to regular gummy candy which may appeal to youth, and also creates a potential for inadvertent exposure to cannabis,” added Hall.</p>
