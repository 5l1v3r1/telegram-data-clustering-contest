      <p>The Taoiseach wants to see the abandoned building where schoolgirl Ana Kriegel was murdered demolished.</p>
      <p>Leo Varadkar said it is very difficult for the entire community to pass the derelict house on the outskirts of Lucan, West Dublin, and believes it should be knocked.</p>
      <p>However, Glenwood House, which is owned by the O’Callaghan family known for their chain of hotels, has a protected- structure status.</p>
      <p>The two-storey mansion was designed by architect James Gandon, who also designed former taoiseach Charles Haughey’s home, Abbeyville, in Kinsealy, north Dublin.</p>
      <p>The farmhouse, built around 1800, has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years, but cannot be touched due to its special status.</p>
      <p>Mr Varadkar has now joined calls from some local councillors to have this status lifted.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s very hard to pass that building without thinking about what happened there.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s not, in my view, a building of enormous architectural merit and I would like to see the designation lifted by the council as well and to have that building demolished.</blockquote>
      <p>The Taoiseach’s comments come after two 15-year-old boys, convicted of Ana’s murder in Lucan, Co Dublin in May 2018, were sentenced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Boy A, who was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault, was sentenced at the Central Criminal Court to life, with a review period after 12 years.</p>
      <p>Boy B was sentenced to 15 years’ detention, with a review after eight years.</p>
      <p>Local councillor Ted Leddy had also called on the building to be de-listed and destroyed.</p>
