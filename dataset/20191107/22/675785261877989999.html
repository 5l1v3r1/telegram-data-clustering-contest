      <h1>Gareth Southgate fires warning to James Maddison after casino controversy</h1>
      <h2>Leicester star Maddison was snapped in a casino on the night England played Czech Republic after he had pulled out of the squad through illness</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:30:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Cross, https://www.facebook.com/johncrossmirror/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Southgate has warned James Maddison that he must be ­“high-performance, low-­maintenance” from now on following his casino own goal.</p>
      <p>Maddison gambled his ­international career by being ­pictured in a casino while England played Czech ­Republic last month, after he left the squad through illness.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> midfielder has been named for Euro 2020 ­qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo even though there was no place for Dele Alli or Jack ­Grealish. But Southgate plans to speak to Maddison when the players meets up next week.</p>
      <p>The England boss said: “It would be dangerous for me to go on a moral crusade. I’m not ­perfect and a lot of the players that we selected have had their ­moments, but it was not a good situation. So, that’s the ­challenge. You want to be high-performance, low-maintenance.</p>

      <p>“I am prepared to work with players who are more difficult but you’re more likely to back those players if they’ve scored a winner for you and sweated blood for you, and that’s the bond you build.</p>
      <p>“James probably didn’t realise what the consequences of going out might be, and he’s not been with an England team before. I’m sure he’s aware of that now.”</p>
      <p>Southgate recalled fit-again Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and John Stones but showed his ruthless streak by overlooking Alli who has started <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ’s last five games and axing Michael Keane after his drop in form. And much-vaunted ­Grealish must wait for his chance.</p>
