      <p>“It’s an honor, I think, that the President of the United States would be interested enough to come to the game,” Saban <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2019/11/06/alabama-nick-saban-shares-presidential-stories-before-donald-trump-visit/2511387001/">told</a> the <i>Montgomery Advertiser</i>. “I’m sure we’ll do everything we can to welcome him.”</p>

      <p>The Tiger’s quarterback said that it was cool to have the president attend the game no matter what your politics are.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of your political views, it’s pretty cool having the President at the game,” Burrow told the media.</p>
      <p>“Doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or a Republican, President at the game is pretty cool,” Burrow concluded.</p>
