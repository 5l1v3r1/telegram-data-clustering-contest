      <h1>Gap CEO Art Peck steps down amid continuing sales slump</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:44:36+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:44</time> by <a rel="author">CBS/AP</a></address>
      <p>Gap CEO Art Peck is stepping down as the company continues to grapple with slumping sales.</p>
      <p>Peck, who has been CEO since 2015, will be temporarily replaced by Gap's non-executive chairman of the board Robert Fisher, the company <a href="https://www.gapinc.com/content/gapinc/html/media/pressrelease/2019/med_pr_11072019_gps_CEOStepsDown.html">said</a>Â Thursday. Peck will also step down from the Gap's board.</p>
      <p>The company is in the midst of splitting into two publicly-traded companies, one for its Old Navy brand and another for the Gap, Banana Republic and its other brands. At the same time, its shares have plunged 35% in the past 12 months as its namesake struggled to attract shoppers amid increased competition from less expensive brands and online retailers.</p>

      <p>The San Francisco-based retailer on Thursday also cut its earnings outlook for the year, and said sales at the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy fell in the most recent quarter.</p>
      <p>Sales at The Gap were the hardest hit, with same-store sales declining 7%, compared with a 3% dip for Banana Republic and a 4% decline for Old Navy.</p>
      <p>Shares of The Gap slid 10% in after-hours trading Thursday.</p>
