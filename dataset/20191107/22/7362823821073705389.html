      <h1>Bustle Digital Group undergoes wave of layoffs, many staffers announce departures on Twitter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:03:52+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Dorman</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">Bustle</a>, an online publication targeting millennial women, shed more than a dozen employees, making it the latest in a series of outlets facing <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/economy/jobs">job losses</a> amid a competitive media environment.</p>
      <p>At least 14 positions were eliminated on Thursday but according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bustle-digital-group-more-layoffs-amid-flagging-morale-2019-11">Business Insider</a>, at least 31 people have been laid off during the past year. The layoffs reportedly affected several editors, as well as six part-time writers.</p>
      <p>Many employees announced their departures on Twitter, including editors for lifestyle, movies, and entertainment sections.</p>

      <p>The layoffs came at a time of transition for Bustle Digital Group (BDG); executives there said they were planning to hire new "marquee" writers for the site. "Bustle's new editorial leadership will soon be announcing several marquee hires as we prepare for a major site relaunch in early 2020," a spokesperson told <a href="http://variety.com/2019/digital/news/bustle-staff-layoffs-major-site-relaunch-1203397109/">Variety.</a></p>
      <p>BDG announced this summer that it was abandoning plans to relaunch the gossip site Gawker after BDG CEO Bryan Goldberg bought its assets in a bankruptcy auction.</p>

      <p>The company reportedly laid off the site's entire staff in July but initially planned a relaunch for a later date.</p>
      <p>BDG was just the latest outlet to cut staff in recent months. Sports Illustrated <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/sports-illustrated-lay-offs">similarly severed</a> more than 40 staff members in October. The left-leaning site Splinter announced that same month it was shutting down, with an executive citing the "fiercely competitive sector."</p>
