      <h3>Multiple suburbs in Adelaide’s west are currently experiencing their third power outage this week thanks to an insulator crack that will be “a momentous task to try and find”.</h3>
      <p>Will Goodings reported during FIVEaa Breakfast on Friday that Findon, Woodville South, Woodville West and Seaton were all without power.</p>
      <blockquote>“We’ve contacted SA Power Networks and as we understand it there is a fundamental infrastructure problem at Findon,” he said.<br/><br/>“There’s a hairline crack in an insulator that is a momentous task to try and find. So while the power can get back up and running to fix the underlying problem causes some real issues.”</blockquote>
      <p>According to SAPN’s Paul Roberts:</p>
      <blockquote>“We scheduled some additional crews this morning to do a full line patrol. We’ve got crews out there now but we’ll have some additional crews assisting.<br/><br/>“It’s obviously inconvenient to have three outages and we don’t want to have another one.”</blockquote>
