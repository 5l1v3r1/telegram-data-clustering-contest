        <b>Great news!</b>
      </p>
      <p>A launch date has been set for <a href="http://nme.com/tag/disney?_ga=2.219141785.1416707994.1573145629-1845887942.1573145629">Disney’s</a> new streaming service in the UK and Ireland.</p>
      <p>Disney+ will be available to viewers in Britain and Ireland views from March 31, 2020, it was announced today (November 7).</p>
      <p>Subscribers in the US, Canada and the Netherlands, however, will gain earlier access to the platform when it launches on Tuesday (November 12).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/disney-details-disney-plus-streaming-service-launch-price-release-date-2475744">Details of Disney+ were announced back in April</a>, a move that’s been anticipated for a number of years, and came after Disney<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/disneys-merger-with-fox-is-becoming-official-next-week-2461058"> completed a $71.3 billion acquisition of a number of 21st Century Fox’s key assets, including its film and TV studios and a large amount of its ‘content portfolio’.</a></p>
      <p>As per a new promotional video shared today on Twitter, viewers will be eventually able to stream Disney-owned and distributed content including <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/star-wars"><i>Star Wars</i></a> films, <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe"><i>Marvel</i></a> films and Disney animatied classics.</p>

      <p>When it launches in the US, it will cost $6.99 (£5.35) per month – <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/disneys-streaming-service-might-be-cheaper-than-netflix-2364570">keeping the promise made last year that Disney+ will cost less per month than Netflix</a>, one of its main competitors.</p>
      <p>Confirmation of the UK and Ireland launch date comes <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/disney-wont-coming-uk-time-2557803">a few weeks after an employee of Disney Life – a UK-only Disney subscription service – replied to a person on Twitter to say that it would be “some time” until the Disney+ service reached British and Irish shores</a>.</p>
