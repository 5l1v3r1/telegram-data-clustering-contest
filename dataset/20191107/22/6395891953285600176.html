      <p><b>DETROITÂ (AP)</b> - Documents released this week by a federal agency raise questions about whether a self-driving Uber SUV that ran down a pedestrian last year should have been allowed on public roads for test purposes.</p>
      <p>A report from the National Transportation Safety Board on a 2018 crash that killed an Arizona woman found that Uber's self-driving system didn't consider jaywalkers. It also had trouble figuring out whether the woman was a pedestrian, vehicle, bicycle or other object.</p>
      <p>Experts say that could mean more regulation is needed before testing is allowed on public roads.</p>
      <p>The board will determine the cause of the crash and make safety recommendations at a meeting in Washington on Nov. 19.</p>
