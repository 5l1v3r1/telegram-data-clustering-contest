      <h1>OnePlus teases mystery new product with photo</h1>
      <h2>Company is seemingly ploughing on with something new, but we hope it isn’t yet another phone</h2>

      <p>OnePlus has teased something new on its UK Twitter feed, posting the below:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/OnePlus_UK/status/1192398930287480832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p>At the time of writing the company has been replying to fans’ guesses in the thread of the tweet, saying it’s not a new phone. When someone asked if it was a desk, the company said, “getting warmer”.</p>
      <p>Are you looking at OnePlus’s foray into furniture? It’s also notable that it has only been tweeted from the UK account, not OnePlus’s global, US or Indian feeds.</p>
      <p>Either way we are glad it’s not a new phone. The company has far too many for sale at the moment, straying far from its once-attractive one phone at a time policy.</p>
      <p>We had a go at boosting the brightness on the dark photo (see above) and, like others online, can see OnePLus has cheekily written “Nice try.” On what looks like a phone given the port and antenna band on the bottom.</p>
      <p>Either way, this apparently UK-centric OnePlus product is just around the corner.</p>
