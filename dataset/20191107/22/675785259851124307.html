      <h2>Tomorrow's Daily Mirror carries a shocking portrayal of the true state of the health service after nine years of Conservative cuts and similar scenes can be witnessed across the country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:23:58+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:23</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>When the Tories next claim the NHS is safe in their hands show them a picture of tomorrow’s Daily Mirror front page.</p>
      <p>It is a shocking portrayal of the true state of the health service after nine years of Conservative cuts.</p>
      <p>Dozens of elderly and frail patients are left stranded on trolleys in an overcrowded emergency room.</p>
      <p>Some of them have had to wait more than six hours for treatment.</p>
      <p>They include an 88-year-old woman with dementia who had to be rushed to hospital after failing to get a GP appointment.</p>
      <p>Despite the heroic efforts of the nurses and doctors, the NHS is not providing the care people need and deserve.</p>
      <p>This is not an isolated incident. Similar scenes can be witnessed across the country.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It is the direct consequence of a Tory administration that has cut the number of hospital beds, failed to recruit enough staff and starved the NHS of funds.</p>
      <p>Waiting lists are at a record high, operations are routinely cancelled and medicines are rationed.</p>
      <p>A health service that was once the envy of the world, famed for the excellence of its staff and for providing world-class treatment, has been betrayed by the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>We can still rebuild our cherished NHS but it will never happen if you vote Conservative.</p>
      <h3>Stop the thugs</h3>
      <p>The murder of Jodie Chesney shocked the nation.</p>
      <p>An innocent teenage girl was stabbed to death in her local park in a case of mistaken identity.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Her killers were yesterday found guilty and should expect to spend their life behind bars.</p>
      <p>For Jodie’s family they will forever grieve the loss of a young woman whose future held so much promise.</p>
      <p>What makes this so distressing is it could have been anyone’s daughter in almost any part of lawless Britain.</p>
      <p>The attack may have been random but there is nothing random about a society where violence has become commonplace, teenagers brazenly brandish knives and lives are held so cheaply.</p>
