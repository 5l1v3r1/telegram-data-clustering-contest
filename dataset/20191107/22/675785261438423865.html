      <h1>Jeff Brazier says being a single dad was 'really tough' amid marriage difficulties</h1>
      <h2>Jeff has two sons, Bobby and Freddie, with Jade Goody, who sadly died aged 27 after a battle with cervical cancer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:50:36+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeff-brazier">Jeff Brazier</a> has opened up about his experience of being a single dad to his two lads, Bobby, 16, and Freddie, 15.</p>
      <p>The 40 year old had his two boys with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jade-goody">Jade Goody</a> , but had to bring them up on his own after the tragic death of their mum in 2009.</p>
      <p>Jade died aged 27, having battled cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>Jeff has since remarried to Kate Dwyer, and recently revealed that they've had "difficulties" because Kate had a "change of heart" about having kids after they tied the knot.</p>
      <p>Now, in a candid interview with podcast <a href="https://www.verifiedviews.co/">Verified Views</a> , Jeff said being a single dad was 'the most difficult experience' of his life.</p>

      <p>"It's been the most difficult experience in my life," he said. "But the most rewarding.</p>
      <p>"And there are moments like, when the boys were best men at my wedding a year ago and they stood up and spoke with such humour and maturity and such feeling and emotional intelligence.</p>
      <p>"And that was the first and only time I think I've ever really allowed myself to pat myself on the back, because it was just, it was there on front of me."</p>
      <p>Jeff added: "I couldn't deny it was incredible because children don't really show you their best, they save that for everybody else. So I hang on some moments like that."</p>
      <p>On his marriage, Jeff's also been very candid.</p>
      <p>Chatting to <a href="https://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/18004286.jeff-brazier-turning-40-life-without-jade-goody/">The Mail</a> , he said: "Being married makes you feel more settled, but life doesn't feel much different because Kate has a wonderful career in PR where she works very hard and long hours, so it's still just me and the boys at home a fair bit.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure whether we'll have children.</p>
      <p>"I had thought when we got married we'd go straight in [on starting a family] but there seems to have been a change of heart about that, and a need for a little more time before those decisions are made.</p>

      <p>"I'm just happy if we do or don't, and I'm content to be patient and let Kate figure all that out."</p>
      <p>He put rumours to bed about a possible split between him and Kate, saying: "It has been tough, but then it was meant to be tough.</p>
      <p>"You know, it was what I signed up to. I didn't necessarily sign up to doing it on my own, but that's nobody's fault.</p>
      <p>"I like to think we've all got the ability to step up and whatever it requires in order to give your children what they need until they no longer require it."</p>
