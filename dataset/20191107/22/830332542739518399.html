      <p>Madison – Mathilda M. "Tillie" Schuchardt, age 96, passed away on Wednesday, November 6, 2019 at Noel Manor in Verona.</p>
      <p>She was born on May 15, 1923 in Milwaukee, Wis., to Peter and Carolina (Carnera) Odorico from Sequals, Italy.</p>
      <p>Tillie is survived by her children, Jim (Mary Jane) Schuchardt, Nancy (Jim) Entgelmeier and Bob (Ruth) Schuchardt; seven grandchildren, Michelle (Bill), Karen (Kevin), Sara (John), Jennie, Eric (Makayla), Cindy (Dennis) and Mike; and six great-grandchildren, Carson, Katelynn, Sophia, Torin, Emmett and Raquel, and one to arrive in April 2020.  </p>
      <p>She was preceded in death by her husband, Emmett C. Schuchardt; parents; sisters, Annie Odorico and Ellie Guastella; and daughter-in-law, Debra Schuchardt.</p>
      <p>Tillie graduated from Madison Central High School.  She was a lifelong member of the old St. Joseph Catholic Church on Park Street and St. James Catholic Church, where she was a member of the National Catholic Society of Foresters. Tillie was the secretary for the Wisconsin Vocational and Adult Education for 10 years.</p>
      <p>She was happily married to her husband, Emmett, until his death on March 2, 2011. Tillie enjoyed her family, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.  One of her greatest joys was family gatherings at the house, and family visiting her at assisted living.
