      <h2>Joe Camplin of LeBoldus, who played for a provincial high school football champion in Grade 9, hopes to win again in Grade 12.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T22:03:58+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 22:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/robvanstone" target="_blank">Rob Vanstone</a></address>
      <p>It is November and Joe Camplin, a Grade 12 student at Dr. Martin LeBoldus Catholic High School, already has a final in mind.</p>
      <p>Camplin is preparing for his last football game with the <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/rob-vanstone-leboldus-golden-suns-and-campbell-tartans-serve-up-a-post-labour-day-classic">LeBoldus Golden Suns</a> — Saturday’s Saskatchewan High Schools Athletic Association 6A final against the Saskatoon Holy Cross Crusaders (1 p.m., Mosaic Stadium).</p>

      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/local-sports/leboldus-golden-suns-keep-title-winning-streak-intact">Holy Cross was also the opponent in 2016, when LeBoldus won its fifth consecutive provincial title.</a> Camplin, a standout on offence and defence, and receiver Ethan Kuski are the only current members of the Golden Suns who were also on the 2016 team.</p>
      <p>“It has been too long, I would say, since we were able to win the last one,” Camplin says. “<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/leboldus-golden-suns-capture-schwann-conference-title">We were fortunate to win (the city final) last week</a>, which we hadn’t done in a couple of years.</p>
      <p>“I was there in 2016 and to have a chance to do it again as a senior with these guys would be great.”</p>

      <p>LeBoldus defeated Holy Cross 47-29 in the 2016 final. The Golden Suns led 33-6 at one point, allowing head coach John Foord to use some of his younger players, such as Camplin.</p>
      <p>Deployment in the provincial final was especially significant for Camplin because his older brother Ben, who was then in Grade 11, also played for LeBoldus. Ben Camplin is now a defensive back with the University of Saskatchewan Huskies.</p>
      <p>Both Camplins have also excelled in basketball for the Golden Suns. Once football season is over, Joe will have a respite of about one week before his intensive sporting schedule resumes.</p>

      <p>Joe Camplin’s versatility is also evident on the football field. In addition to playing linebacker and left offensive tackle, he is used at times as a tight end.</p>
      <p>In one game this season for the undefeated Golden Suns, the 6-foot-3, 200-pounder scored on a reception and an interception return.</p>
      <p>The contributions extend even further, considering that Foord lauds Camplin as “a high honours student, a leader, and a positive role model within our building.”</p>
      <p>As much as Camplin enjoys football, he also takes considerable pride in what happens away from the field at LeBoldus.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, you’re here to get your diploma and keep your grades up, and football is just a sport that you’re lucky enough to play when you’re in high school,” he says.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to keep your grades up and Coach Foord is great with that, too. If you’re failing in a class or slacking in a class, he’s the first one to let you know. He won’t let you practise or anything like that if you’re not doing well in school.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably part of the reasons we’ve been (to the provincial final) so many times. All facets are covered.”</p>
      <p>Just one more step remains — Camplin’s final game of high school football.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s going to be sad,” he says. “It’ll be a lot more sad if we don’t get a win, but I’m still lucky enough to have been able to play here for four years and meet so many people and be coached by so many great coaches.</p>
      <p>“To have it come to an end will be a bittersweet day, so it’s tough to think about. There are a lot of great memories on that field out there. Hopefully it’ll end on the right note.”</p>
      <p>• The SHSAA’s 5A final is set for Saturday at 1 p.m., when the Yorkton Regional Raiders will play host to the Saskatoon Bishop Mahoney Saints.</p>
