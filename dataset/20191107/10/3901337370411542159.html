        <b>Check out some of the best moments from Chiefs' latest win in the gallery above!</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Glamour Boys wake up this morning with a seven-point lead at the top of the Absa Premiership table after Mamelodi Sundowns only managed a draw against Baroka while Ernst Middendorp's side dispatched Chippa United with a 2-0 victory. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>With things looking set for a draw, Dumsani Zuma twice found the back of the net - his first ever Absa Premiership brace - to give Middendorp's side the three points, putting them in an enviable position on top of the table with just one game left before the international break.</p>
      <p>It means that the Amakhosi will be able to call themselves table-toppers for at least another month given the break and the Telkom Knockout semifinal that follows, with their German coach currently going some way towards silencing the critics that were calling for his head just a few short months ago.</p>
      <p>The victory also means that Chiefs are now experiencing their best start to a season since 2014/15 - five years ago, when they burst out of the blocks under Stuart Baxter's tutelage, and fans will be quick to point out how that season ended... With the Glamour Boys as champions.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Another plus for their coach will be the fact that, also for the first time since 2014/15, they've kept five clean sheets in a row despite their changing backline, and with a third of the season played they have the joint-best defensive record in the league with just five goals conceded.</p>
