      <p>The developer behind <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alwas_awakening"><b>Alwa's Awakening</b></a> is set to launch a brand new game on Switch called <b>Alwa's Legacy</b>, as long as it can generate the necessary funds through Kickstarter, that is.</p>
      <p>Eden Pixels describes the new title as a "modern retro game full of dangerous dungeons, magical items and ancient secrets". It's a non-linear adventure game said to be full of exploration, with no particular path being the 'correct' way to choose.</p>
      <p>Here's a feature list and some screenshots:</p>
      <blockquote>Customize how you play - With our upgrade system you can choose how you want to play - Explorative, offensive or strategic. It’s your choice!<br/><br/>Exploration is rewarded - Don’t leave any stone unturned, the world of Alwa is filled with secrets and finding them requires you to explore and solve puzzles<br/><br/>A non-linear experience - Combining exploration and different item upgrades allows you to find your own way through this adventure</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Looks and sounds amazing - Enjoy crisp pixel-art combined with modern effects as well as a soundtrack made by chiptune extraordinaire RushJet1<br/><br/>A challenge awaits - Quick reflexes are needed to navigate through the many challenging rooms and with easy-to-change settings anyone can enjoy Alwa’s Legacy</blockquote>

      <p>You can learn more about it and pledge your support over on the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eldenpixels/alwas-legacy/description">Kickstarter page</a>. We imagine this has the potential to do pretty well with Switch fans - the original game's first week on the Switch eShop <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/10/alwars_awakening_first_week_switch_eshop_sales_outperform_launch_month_on_steam">outperformed its first whole month on Steam</a>.</p>
      <p>Will you be backing this one? Are you hoping it does manage to make its way to Switch? Let us know in the comments.</p>
