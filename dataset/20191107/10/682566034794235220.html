      <p>Cape Town - In reply to <b>Manchester City</b> manager <b>Pep Guardiola</b>, <b>Liverpool </b>star forward <b>Sadio Mane</b> joked that if diving will get him a penalty then he will do it.</p>
      <p>The Spanish mentor went out on a limb to praise the Senegal international saying that he is a special talent who "sometimes" dives.</p>
      <p>"It's happened a lot for Liverpool in the last years (scoring late on). It's because he's a special talent," Guardiola said of Mane on the <i>BBC</i>.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes he's diving, sometimes he has this talent to score incredible goals in the last minute. He's a talent."</p>
      <p>Soon after the comments, Liverpool manager <b>Jurgen Klopp </b>came to player's defence and strongly insisted that Mane does not dive.</p>
      <p>"I'm not really in a Man City mood at the moment,” said Klopp after hearing Guardiola's comments.</p>
      <p>"Do I like that he says this about one of my players? I'm not even 100 per cent sure if he spoke about Sadio (Mane) or us in general. I didn't hear Sadio's name."</p>
      <p>Klopp added: "Sadio is not a diver. There was a situation in the Aston Villa game where he got contact and went down. Maybe it wasn't a penalty but there was contact - it's not (his) like jumping over a leg and acting like he hit you."</p>
      <p>Mane, who has been Liverpool's in-form player this season, took lightly to Guardiola's comments and even joked that he will do it again.</p>
      <p>"If the 'dive' will give me a penalty then I will do it! Why not? But what Jurgen said is correct. I do not dive,” said Mane as quoted by Sky Sports News.</p>
      <p>"There was contact (at Villa) for sure. Maybe it was not a penalty and he didn't give it, and he gave me a yellow card. To be honest I don't have any problem about it.</p>
      <p>"It's what I want to keep doing. If I get a penalty, yeah, it's a penalty. If no penalty, no penalty, but (it) will never change the way I'm playing or the way I'm doing my things.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's could be considered as mind games with City travelling to Anfield on Sunday to take on Liverpool in a top of the table clash.</p>
      <p>The Reds are unbeaten in the Premier League and are six points ahead of the champions.</p>
      <p>A win for City will take Guardiola's side within three points of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a win for Klopp's charges will surge the Reds to a 9-point gap with a two-week international break on the horizon.</p>
      <p>Sunday's match starts at 18:30 (SA time).</p>
