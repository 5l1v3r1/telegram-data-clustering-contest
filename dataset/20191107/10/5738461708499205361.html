      <p>Dundalk councillor Ruairí Ó Murchú has welcomed a commitment from Minister of State for Disabilities, Finian McGrath, to keep the respite care home, Sruthán House, open.</p>
      <p>Cllr Ó Murchú, along with Councillor Maeve Yore, attended the visit to Sruthán House by the Minister yesterday, where Minister McGrath voiced his commitment to keeping Sruthán House open. </p>
      <p>Welcoming the news, Cllr Ó Murchú said:</p>
      <p>“I have fully supported the campaign for the retention of respite services at Sruthán House. The people who stay in Sruthán House and their families are a community and since closure was threatened they have voiced their overwhelming support for the facility. </p>
      <p>“Last month I attended a specially convened meeting during which the HSE confirmed that, following a period of consultation, the decision had been made to keep Sruthán House open.  </p>
      <p>“The Minister’s visit and comments today have further demonstrated the success of the campaign mounted by service users when faced with the possibility of closure."</p>
      <p>The Sinn Féin general election candidate added:</p>
      <p>“I understand that there are a number of actions which the HSE will now undertake to ensure that Sruthán House will provide the optimum service and value for money.  </p>
      <p>“I will do everything I can to ensure the excellent service provided by staff at Sruthán House is maintained and enhanced.”</p>
