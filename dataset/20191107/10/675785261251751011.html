      <h2>A glitch in Fortnite has been discovered that’s led to many players receiving formal warnings for simply watching games</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:05:44+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:05</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fortnite">Fortnite </a>hit the headlines after it banned a British teen from the game for cheating.</p>
      <p>Now, a glitch in Fortnite has been discovered that’s led to many players receiving formal warnings for simply watching games.</p>
      <p>The issue is with the ‘spectate game in progress’ mode, which allows players to simply watch the game, rather than actually  play.</p>
      <p>Bizarrely, players in this mode have been receiving behaviour warnings for ‘teaming’ - the practice of working together in a game.</p>
      <p>The warning reads: "Behaviour Warning. Due to your recent actions you have been warned for Teaming. Please refrain from repeat offenses or you may receive an account ban."</p>

      <p>The reason for this glitch remains unclear, although Epic Games claims that it is ‘going to address this as quickly as possible.’</p>
      <p>While these false warnings are no doubt quite irritating, many players have received compensation, in the form of 1,000 V-Bucks.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/epic-accidentally-tells-fortnite-players-theyre-cheatin-1839676680">Kotaku</a>, that’s more than enough to buy the Season 2 Battle pass - jackpot!</p>
      <p>The glitch comes shortly after YouTuber Jarvis Kaye was banned from Fortnite for cheating.</p>
      <p>Jarvis, known as FaZe Jarvis, broadcast a video of him using ‘aimbots’ - a tactic that is banned on Fortnite - to his two million YouTube subscribers.</p>
      <p>Epic Games, the developer behind Fortnite, immediately banned Jarvis from the game, sparking a fierce debate of whether cheating should result in a permanent ban.</p>
