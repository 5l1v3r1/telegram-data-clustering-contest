      <p>NME has contacted Amazon Prime for comment.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Amazon Prime Video announced <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/kacey-musgraves-host-star-amazon-prime-christmas-special-lana-del-rey-camila-cabello-james-corden-2564425">an all-star Christmas special hosted by Kacey Musgraves and featuring Lana Del Rey, Camila Cabello, James Corden</a>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the service, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/season-2-amazon-prime-video-series-modern-love-2561172">a second season of new show <i>Modern Love</i></a> – based on a <i>New York Times</i> column of the same name – has been ordered.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/modern-love-review-amazon-prime-2558711">NME’s Alex Flood called the series “the most wholesome new show on TV”</a> in a review, adding: “<i>Modern Love </i>is an uplifting experience with more than enough ‘aww’ moments to keep you ploughing on through all eight episodes (hankie in hand).</p>
      <p>Obviously, it depends entirely on your predilection for a happy ending – and one suspects those who cringe at schmaltz will probably hate it. But if your heart still pumps and hasn’t turned to stone completely, <i>Modern Love </i>will give you hope in humanity again. Well, at least until the next depressing viral video invades your newsfeed.”</p>
      <p>A new <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/tv-blogs/lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-release-date-plot-cast-2170413"><i>Lord Of The Rings</i> TV series</a> will also come to the service in the future, with an expected release date of 2021.</p>
