      <h1>USA, China, Japan and Korea to dominate 5G</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:53:20+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/77/reuters/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><b>BERLIN: </b>China, the United States, Japan, and Korea will account for more than half of the world’s subscribers to super-fast 5G mobile networks by 2025, leaving Europe lagging, a study showed on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Europe, moving more slowly to build 5G networks, will lag in terms of consumer take-up. Yet the picture looks different in business, where 5G will be able to run ‘smart’ factories using connected robots, devices, and sensors.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a small cluster of countries that leads adoption in 5G, with the rest of the world following,” Tim Hatt, head of research at GSMA Intelligence, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>“China, Japan, Korea, and the US – between those, you’re looking at well over half of worldwide 5G subscribers by 2025.”</p>
      <p>The rapid rollout of 5G networks, with speeds fast enough to download a movie to a smartphone in seconds, has surprised many. Nokia, the world’s No.2 network vendor behind Huawei, recently suspended its dividend to invest in upgrading the 5G gear it sells to carriers.</p>
      <p>In Korea, 66% of mobile connections will be 5G by mid-decade, GSMA Intelligence forecast in a 100-page study, followed by the United States on 50% and Japan on 49%.</p>
      <p>In terms of sheer numbers, China will predominate with 600 million 5G connections. Worldwide, 1.57 billion people are expected to adopt 5G by 2025 – or 18% of total mobile users.</p>
      <p>Early experience shows that carriers can hike 5G prices by 15%-20%, offering ‘more for more’ unlimited data plans. But, if the past is anything to go by, those gains will eventually have competed away.</p>
      <p>EUROPE LAGS – OR DOES IT?</p>
      <p>With standards to enter force in a couple of years that will support the development of the industrial ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT), such usage is seen by the European industry as a more promising way to recoup the vast outlays needed for 5G.</p>
      <p>Rather than sell to enterprise clients, Hatt said carriers would be better off teaming up with them on projects in the IoT – a market that GSMA Intelligence forecasts will be worth $1 trillion in 2025, roughly equal to total mobile industry revenue last year.</p>
      <p>Yet of that, only 5% will come from connectivity, forcing carriers to compete with global consulting firms and Silicon Valley tech giants like Amazon or Microsoft for the rest of the pie, said Hatt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4G ROLLS ON</b>
      </p>
      <p>For developing nations, it’s the spread of affordable connectivity through older 4G technology – and not 5G – that will affect the lives of billions of people for years to come, the research arm of telecoms industry group GSMA found.</p>
      <p>Looking to emerging markets like Nigeria, Mexico, India or Indonesia, a combination of cheap Android smartphones and affordable data still offers growth potential.</p>
      <p>GSMA Intelligence forecasts that 59% of total worldwide mobile connections will be 4G in 2025.</p>
      <p>“For a lot of these countries 5G is just not on the horizon right now,” said Hatt.</p>
      <p>“That 4G generation (is) for the most part mobile only. They don’t have computers… This is a whole new ball game and the operators are pretty well-positioned to take advantage of that.”</p>
