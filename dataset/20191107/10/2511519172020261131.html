      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jeff-goldblum">Jeff Goldblum</a> has said he thinks there is “a presumption of innocence until proven guilty” regarding <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/WoodyAllen">Woody Allen</a> and the sexual abuse allegations made against him.</p>
      <p>Allen was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dylan-farrow-woody-allen-sexual-abuse-tv-a8166341.html">accused of child molestation</a> by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow. He has always denied any abuse.</p>
      <p>Since the allegations came to light, numerous Hollywood figures including Colin Firth and Greta Gerwig have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/colin-firth-woody-allen-magic-in-the-moonlight-metoo-sexual-harassment-a8167291.html">pledged never to make a film with Allen again.</a></p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/jeff-goldblum-interview-jurassic-world-me-too-woody-allen-858437">new interview with the <i>i</i></a> <i>Paper</i>, Goldblum has said he “would consider working with” the director in the future, having had a minor role in his 1977 film <i>Annie Hall.</i><i> </i></p>
      <p>“I think there is a presumption of innocence until proven guilty,” said Goldblum. “I know I enjoyed working with him many years ago and I sat in with his band once too.”</p>
      <p>He added: "Even though I feel like this cultural shift [the #MeToo movement] is very, very positive and long overdue and I support it wholeheartedly and take it very seriously, I also admire his body of work. So I would consider working with him again, until I learned something more.” </p>
      <p>Goldblum can next be seen in the Marvel series <i>What If…? </i>alongside Hayley Atwell and Chadwick Boseman. </p>
      <p>His new jazz album <i>I Shouldn’t Be Telling You This</i> is out now on Decca Records.</p>
