      <h1>EU Hearing 'Many Concerns' About Potential Anticompetitive Issues With Apple Pay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:26:46+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:26</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Slivka</a></address>
      <p>European Union Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager today acknowledged that her department has received "many concerns" over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and potential anticompetitive issues, noting that "people see it becomes increasingly difficult to compete in the market for easy payments," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-antitrust-apple/eus-vestager-says-has-received-many-concerns-regarding-apple-pay-idUSKBN1XH1YL">reports <i>Reuters</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Vestager's comments come after the European Commission <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-apple-antitrust/apple-pay-in-eu-antitrust-spotlight-as-regulators-seek-details-idUSKBN1X829Y">sent a questionnaire</a> to a number of companies in August seeking information on whether Apple was restricting online payment options.</p>
      <blockquote>The questionnaire asked if companies were under a contractual obligation to enable a certain payment method and also if such contracts included conditions for integrating ‌Apple Pay‌ in their apps and websites. <br/><br/>Regulators wanted to know if Apple has rejected merchant apps as incompatible with the terms and conditions for integrating ‌Apple Pay‌ in their apps.</blockquote>
      <p>Apple touts the safety and security of ‌Apple Pay‌, but critics have claimed that Apple stifles competition by locking down the NFC chip in iOS devices to only work with ‌Apple Pay‌, making it difficult for other payment services to compete. <br/><br/>Antitrust concerns over ‌Apple Pay‌ are not the only issue for Apple and the EU at the moment, as the European Commission is also still dealing with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">Spotify's complaint</a> that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/app-store/">App Store</a> unfairly disadvantages third-party app developers in favor of its own apps and services. <br/><br/>Note: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forumdisplay.php?f=47">Politics, Religion, Social Issues</a> forum.
