      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> rapper TI has provoked outrage by revealing that he forces his 18-year-old daughter to undergo an annual "virginity test" at the gynaecologist.</p>
      <p>The Grammy-winning musician told a podcast how he escorts Deyjah Harris to the doctor's office after each birthday to "check her hymen".</p>
      <p>"Usually like the day after the [birthday] party, she's enjoying her gifts, I put a sticky note on the door: 'Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30'," TI, whose real name is Clifford Harris, told the presenters.</p>
      <p>The trips began after Deyjah's 16th birthday, Harris said, and his daughter was required to sign a waiver allowing the doctor to share the "results" with him.</p>
      <p>The episode of the Ladies Like Us podcast was released on Tuesday, but appeared to have been removed on Wednesday afternoon after it went viral on social media.</p>
      <p>Social media users were quick to condemn Harris's behaviour, and express concern for Deyjah.</p>
      <p>"It's extremely abusive to police your daughter's hymen and any doctor who would participate in such an act needs to lose their license," tweeted author Ijeoma Oluo.Â </p>

      <p>Jennifer Gunter, a gynaecologist and bestselling writer, added that "hymen exams are medically not a thing", and that the so-called tests "support a disgusting patriarchal trope".</p>
      <p>The presence of an intact hymen - which can easily be broken without engaging in sexual activity - is not regarded as an effective way to test virginity.</p>
      <h3>'Prisoner'</h3>
      <p>In the podcast, female hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham laugh at Harris's comments, jokingly referring to his daughter as a "prisoner".</p>
      <p>Harris's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>A Twitter account appearing to belong to Deyjah Harris had "liked" several comments condemning the rapper's behaviour, including one describing it as "disgusting, possessive and controlling".</p>

      <p>Harris, 39, is one of the leading forces in trap music, a style of hip-hop from the US South that emphasises aggressive lyricism and 1980s-style drum machines.</p>
      <p>He served seven months in prison in 2009 for attempting to buy unregistered machine guns from dealers who turned out to be undercover agents.</p>
      <p>He spent another 10 months in prison two years later for violating terms of probation on drug charges.</p>
      <p>He has won three Grammy Awards, including for the song My Love, a collaboration with pop star Justin Timberlake.</p>
