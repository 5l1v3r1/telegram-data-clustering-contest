      <h1>Captaincy was unexpected, never thought I will lead Bangladesh: Mominul Haque</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:37:15+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:37</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>DHAKA: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mominul-Haque">Mominul Haque</a> was "not ready at all" for Test captaincy but the thought of leading Bangladesh against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>'s India makes him feel good.</p>
      <p>Mominul said he was completely taken by surprise at the Bangladesh <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Board's decision to hand him the Test captaincy in place of banned <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shakib-Al-Hasan">Shakib Al Hasan</a>.</p>
      <p>Shakib was banned last week by the ICC for two years (one year suspended sentence) for failing to report corrupt approaches.</p>
      <p>"I was not ready at all. It was completely unexpected. I never thought even in my dreams that I will be the captain of Bangladesh or I will captain the Test side," Monimul told reporters on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Mominul, 28, has never led a top domestic team but has been entrusted with the big responsibility to captain the national side for a high-profile assignment starting next week.</p>
      <p>"I am very excited as I think Virat Kohli is the best player in the world, the best batsman in all formats combined. Thinking about that makes me feel good," he said.</p>
      <p>The first Test of the series will be played in Indore from November 14 to 18, while the second match will mark the inaugural day-night Test between the two sides, in Kolkata from November 22.</p>
      <p>Talking about playing his maiden day-night Test, Mominul said: "We have not played a Test under the floodlights and with the pink ball. It is a very good chance to play good cricket."</p>
      <p>The left-handed batsman, who has played 36 Tests and scored 2,613 runs for Bangladesh, however, said the innovation would not affect his game.</p>
      <p>"I never considered captaincy as pressure or responsibility. If I keep thinking that as a captain I have to take extra responsibility to carry the team forward then I will be under some pressure," said Mominul, who is not part of Bangladesh's T20 squad.</p>
      <p>"But if I play my natural game, and think that I am a batsman who needs to score for his team, then it will not have any effect."</p>
