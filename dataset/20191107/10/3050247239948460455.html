      <h1>Max Keiser: Bitcoin's 'Self-Settlement' Is a Revolution Against Dollar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:55:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) beats both <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/fiat-money">fiat currency</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/gold">gold</a> because it does not need settlement, RT host <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/max-keiser">Max Keiser</a> has said.</p>
      <p>In the latest episode of the network’s <a href="https://www.rt.com/shows/keiser-report/472721-budget-deficit-stocks-bitcoin/">Keiser Report</a> on Nov. 7, the well-known Bitcoin bull explained that other forms of transactions need settlement time, but Bitcoin does not.</p>
      <h3>Keiser: BTC “uniquely self-settling”</h3>
      <p>This is because, in Bitcoin, the transaction and settlement are inseparable from one another. Moving BTC between wallets simply means updating a ledger, which implies instantaneous settlement as miners confirm the transactions. </p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of friction, both in paper and in gold. Bitcoin, uniquely, is self-settling — the transaction is the settlement. When the transaction hits, it settles,” Keiser summarized.</p>
      <p>The episode appeared as governments supporting paper fiat with <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/digital-currency">digital versions</a> of national currencies continue to form a major talking point worldwide.</p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinas-president-xi-credentialized-cryptocurrency-says-novogratz">reported</a>, China looks to be the first state to issue a digital yuan, while other central banks are eyeing the possibility, including the European Central Bank, or <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ecb">ECB</a>.</p>
      <p>While digital transactions would cut both costs and settlement times, such currencies’ relationship to the fiat system ultimately makes them political tools — with Keiser pointing the “weaponization” of the U.S. dollar for sanctions — and subject to censorship as well as other centralization pitfalls. </p>
      <h3>Anti-Bitcoin Congressman “doesn’t understand he’s lost”</h3>
      <p>Keiser meanwhile also criticized U.S. congressman Brad Sherman, the notorious Bitcoin critic who continues to argue for an <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-congressman-warns-crypto-may-displace-or-interfere-with-dollar">outright ban</a> on cryptocurrency. </p>
      <p>“Brad Sherman is going to a gunfight with a knife, he has failed to take on board exactly what the dimension of this battle is going to be,” he said. Keiser added:<br/><br/>“He doesn’t understand he’s already lost.”</p>
      <p>Other governments looking to undermine U.S. dollar supremacy should thus open up their access to Bitcoin and make it part of their reserves. Rumors have long swirled around <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/russia">Russia</a>, in particular, <a href="https://twitter.com/martik/status/1113158921169059840?lang=en">buying up</a> large amounts of Bitcoin in the face of international sanctions.</p>
