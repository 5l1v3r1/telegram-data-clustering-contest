      <p>Ramsey scored his first Champions League goal for Juve during the club's 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow when he poked home Ronaldo's free-kick, despite it looking like the ball would have crossed the line anyway.</p>
      <p>The former Arsenal star immediately acknowledged that he had stolen his teammate's goal and, in a video that has circulated on social media, could be seen mouthing "that's your goal" to a smiling Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>Ramsey also revealed that he apologised to the former Real Madrid star, and explained his reasoning for putting the ball in the back of the net.</p>
      <p>"I thought the keeper was a lot closer to me and had a chance of diving back and maybe clearing it," Ramsey said after the match, as reported by <i>IBTimes.</i></p>
      <p>"My instinct took over to make sure that it went over the line. I've apologised to Cristiano."</p>
