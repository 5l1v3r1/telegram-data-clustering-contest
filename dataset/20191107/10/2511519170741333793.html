      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/everton-fc">Everton</a> midfielder <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/andre-gomes">Andre Gomes</a> has issued a thank you message to supporters and well-wishers, after leaving hospital this week.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese international suffered a fracture dislocation of the ankle after a tackle from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham</a>‘s Son Heung-min in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> match at the weekend and underwent surgery on Monday.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Merseyside club confirmed that the midfielder had been discharged and was headed home, before Gomes himself released a video on Twitter to thank fans for their support.</p>
      <p>“Hi everyone. As you already know everything went well,” he began.</p>
      <p>“I’m already at home with my family and I’d like to thank you all for the support, the messages and the positive energy. Thank you.”</p>
      <p>No timeframe has been put on Gomes’ recovery by Everton, though it is unlikely he’ll play a meaningful role, if anything, this season.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Son once more apologised for his part in the injury, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/son-heung-min-sorry-andre-gomes-injury-tottenham-champions-league-goals-red-star-a9188561.html">telling BT Sport how he remained sorry and had to focus for the good of the team</a>.</p>
      <p>Son scored twice in Spurs’ 4-0 win over Red Star Belgrade.</p>
