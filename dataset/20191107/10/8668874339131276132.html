      <h1>O'Gara: Why 'it's probably better' that Sexton doesn't captain Ireland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:40:03+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:40</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> 10 Ronan O’Gara has suggested that he doesn’t think Jonathan Sexton is the natural choice for the Irish captaincy.</p>
      <p>An <a href="http://www.irishrugby.ie/">Ireland</a> team steered at 10 by Sexton were knocked out of the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> after a humbling loss to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> in what was yet another disappointing quarter-final exit for the men in green.</p>
      <p>While they enjoyed a fierce and at times bitter rivalry on the pitch, the pair became fast friends off it after they shared time at Racing 92, where O’Gara coached Sexton from 2013-2015.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland/players/rory-best/">Rory Best</a> retiring from the game, O’Gara believes the time is right for Sexton to step to the side to allow someone else take over the captaining of the team.</p>
      <p>“Johnny is at the other end of the spectrum, I think he is 34. An outhalf, a good outhalf, is always a good leader in his own right, does he need the captaincy?,” O’Gara told<i> Virgin Media Ireland’s</i> Nathaniel Cope.</p>

      <p>“I am not too sure, in the fact that he has so much else on his plate trying to drive the team around the pitch.</p>
      <p>“With that you have an awful lot of media work, you have an awful lot on; for example even the coin toss interrupts your routine before a game. Whether he is the official captain or not, he is going to be one of three people hugely important in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>“So from my point of view I think it’s probably better that the number 10 isn’t the captain, I think it’s better that you have a forward as captain.”</p>
      <p>Many people’s choice for captain is the 23-year-old James Ryan. A darling of the Irish media after three monumental seasons with Ireland and Leinster, Ryan is the odds on favorite to take over as Ireland skipper.</p>

      <p>“He makes the game look easy, I think he thoroughly prepared, I think he is a thorough professional, I think he enjoys playing rugby,” O’Gara said <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/wp/best-lays-down-gauntlet-to-ryan-and-roux-following-massive-loss-of-toner-intellectual-property/">of the 6 foot 8 inch secondrow</a>.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know because I have never shared a dressing room with him what his qualities as a leader are, but if he is a good leader he should automatically be in contention to be an Irish captain, because these things for some people, you can overestimate it, but a good leader has to have the capacity to communicate well.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you can communicate through your actions, it doesn’t need to be words. So he can lead from the front, it is a great position to be a captain, you look at the influence Paul O’Connell had in his career as leader in the second row and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/leinster/players/james-ryan/">James Ryan</a> and an awful lot of people say there is similarities between them.”</p>
