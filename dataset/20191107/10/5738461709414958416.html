      <p>A 28 year old local man who admitted a series of offences ranging from drink driving while he was disqualified for theft, was sentenced to four months at Dundalk district court last week.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Charles McDowell with an address at Clois Bríd, Saltown was banned from driving for three years when gardai received a report of a Renault Clio driving erratically in the Slieve Foy area of Dundalk on November 11th 2016.</p>
      <p>He was arrested and subsequently failed a drink driving breath test.</p>
      <p>On July fifth 2017, he asked a man walking through Ladywell Shrine if he could use his mobile phone, which he then placed into his pocket.</p>
      <p>A woman who was with him persuaded him to return it, but the court heard the casing was damaged when he threw it to the ground.</p>
      <p>Four months later he stole a €5.00 hat from Penney's in the Marshes Shopping Centre and in March last year he was arrested for public order offences following an altercation with neighbours.</p>
      <p>The court also heard how he stole cider and a bottle of merlot from a Londis store in the town.</p>
      <p>The accused had 22 previous convictions, but his solicitor stressed the most recent of those were recorded in 2015.</p>
      <p>He added that his client's life has nose-dived over the past number of years - his house went on fire and he had been injured in a fall - all of which he said was down to the accused taking alcohol and his expectations and outlook were very glum before he went into custody.</p>
      <p>Judge Eirinn McKiernan imposed a four year driving ban for the drink driving offence, four months for the criminal damage to the phone and a two month concurrent sentence for a theft offence and directed that he receive medical treatment for his addiction while in custody.</p>
      <p>She said the accused could appeal on his own bond of €300 with an independent surety of €500.</p>
