      <p>A dad-of-four was knocked unconscious in a brutal one-punch attack after confronting a group for parking in a disabled bay.</p>
      <p>David Fletcher, 48, was walking towards a shopping centre in Atwell, Perth in Western Australia when he saw a white Subaru sedan parked in the spot without a disabled parking permit.</p>
      <p>He called the driver and her two passengers out and told them to find another parking spot.</p>
      <p>David, who works as a mechanical fitter, told <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/national/man-knocked-unconscious-after-calling-out-group-parked-in-atwell-disabled-parking-bay-wa-news/b42d005d-9c31-4ba4-b28e-d5e25ebfbbc8?fbclid=IwAR1ze2Z90GaXVmyOdd_RejVgGPGp8Oxm3AFxkjVG9mqfISkkheM_Gv0FSGw">9News</a> : "They all started hurling abuse at me.</p>
      <p>"This is a disabled bay for disabled people. You don't take advantage of that sort of thing."</p>

      <p>The incident, which happened on Tuesday, was captured on CCTV at the carpark showing the moment a man in an orange t-shirt punches David in the head.</p>
      <p>The blow sends him flying and he hits the ground on his back.</p>
      <p>David was knocked out by the punch and he was left lying on the pavement until he gained conscious.</p>
      <p>He said: "I remember the foul words coming out of the girl's mouth and really not much more."</p>

      <p>David said he was 'blindsided' and punched in jaw by the 'cowardly' attack.</p>
      <p>He walked to a nearby chemist asking for assistance and was later admitted to Fiona Stanley Hospital.</p>
      <p>According to reports, he suffered bleeding from the head and a suspected concussion.</p>
      <p>He was discharged later the same day but he continued having <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/rid-your-headache-migraine-just-8733302">headaches</a> and nausea.</p>
      <p>"If I came across the same thing - doing the same in a disbaled bay again - I'd do the same," he added.</p>

      <p>Atwell Police yesterday arrested a 23-year-old man with charge of an assault occasioning bodily harm. He will face a trial at court at a later date.</p>
      <p>Officers also released the footage to the local council in an effort to find the driver.</p>
      <p>In Australia, drivers found parking in a disabled spot without a permit can face a fine of $572 (£307) and one demerit point.</p>
