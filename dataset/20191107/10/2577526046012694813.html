      <h1>Epic Accidentally Tells Fortnite Players They're Cheating Just For Watching Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T10:07:21+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 10:07</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, Epic had a little problem with its a spectator mode in <i>Fortnite</i>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/drm5ek/the_spectate_game_in_progress_feature_is_falsely/?utm_content=timestamp&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=d811ddc1d6c04200bd32b6ca57410e1b&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=drm5ek">accidentally issuing formal warnings</a> to some players who were just hangin’ out on a server watching other people play.</p>
      <p>Turns out the ‘spectate game in progress’ mode was at fault, with the game mistakenly believing that players simply watching a game were instead involved in ‘teaming’, the practice of players working together actually <i>in</i> a game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ds3x47/epic_are_sending_out_1000_vbucks_if_you_were/?utm_content=timestamp&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=76b4e0c51aa14820a142496682d95030&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=ds3x47">As this Reddit thread points out</a>, some of those falsely warned are now getting an apology from Epic – who have addressed and fixed the error – in the form of 1,000 V-Bucks. For reference, resident <i>Fortnite </i>expert Riley MacLeod tells me that’s enough to buy the season 2 battle pass with 50 V-Bucks left in change, so it could have been worse.</p>
