      <h2>Two of snookers legendary figures meet in Coventry on Thursday knowing it will be the final time they could meet</h2>

      <p>Jimmy White knows his emotional clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ronnie-osullivan">Ronnie O’Sullivan</a> could be the last time they meet on the big stage.</p>
      <p>The Whirlwind knew he had seen a special talent when being blown away 5-1 by a then 16-year-old tour rookie 27 years ago.</p>
      <p>Kindred snooker spirits with a need to entertain the crowd, White’s desire for playing to the gallery cost him titles.</p>
      <p>But five-time world champion O’Sullivan, 43, has managed both – breaking almost all the game’s major records.</p>
      <p>The mantle of ‘People’s Champion’ inherited by White, now 57, from the late and great Alex Higgins was duly passed on to O’Sullivan.</p>

      <p>And a sell-out crowd will turn up today at Coventry’s Ricoh Arena to salute their heroes at a Champion of Champions last-16 meeting.</p>
      <p>White, in the field thanks to his World Seniors win, famously lost all six of his world championship finals – but that overshadowed a glittering career with many titles.</p>
      <p>He said: “You never know how many more of these really big occasions against Ronnie there could be in a major tournament.</p>
      <p>“I am lucky I get to play him in exhibitions - but this is different. This is the big time again, and why I still practice. To be able to enjoy and absorb that atmosphere.</p>
      <p>“I always fancied I would be drawn against Ronnie, it just seemed like fate might take a hand.</p>

      <p>“I was watching the video of my ‘This Is Your Life’ the other day with some people. And I spotted Ronnie on the stage at 17 maybe, I had forgotten he was there.</p>
      <p>“That was a nice memory. I have always been his biggest fan, but he knows I will be really trying to win on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I remember vividly him beating me 5-1 in Blackpool just after he turned pro. I said to my driver on the way home ‘That is an absolute breath of fresh air for snooker’.</p>
      <p>“We earned any fans with the way we play. And I hope there will be a few mums and dads telling their kids ‘Jimmy White can play a bit too – Ronnie’s no certainty’!</p>
      <p>“I hope I helped Ronnie. I know sometimes I played to the crowd, and it did cost me. I told him at an early age that to win you can’t always do that.</p>

      <p>“But he has a naturally crowd-pleasing style anyway, allied to a real will to win that isn’t always highlighted.”</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan will be the hot favourite, and holds an incredible record at the event with three titles and two more final appearances.</p>
      <p>He has often struggled with the tour treadmill, and so is in awe of White’s continued enthusiasm and lack of bitterness over his career setbacks.</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan said: “He is just a very optimistic guy and I wish I could keep that sort of attitude in the future because if I could, I would play a lot longer than I expect to.</p>
      <p>“He is not bitter about whatever scars he has and blows the sport has dealt him. He just gets on with it. And that is all about a genuine love for the game.</p>
      <p>“I remember so many of both the games between us – he beat me a couple of times at the Masters – and his other big Crucible finals.</p>
      <p>“The match that left me gobsmacked as a kid was his Mercantile Credit Classic 1986 final against Cliff Thorburn, I was only 10.</p>
      <p>“It was 12-12, he needed a snooker on pink in the decider, got it, then potted pink and black and lifted the trophy. What a way to win.</p>
      <p>“I am surprised he is still playing if I am honest – but he just loves it still, doesn’t he? Not me, I’d have been out the door a long time ago in his position.”</p>
