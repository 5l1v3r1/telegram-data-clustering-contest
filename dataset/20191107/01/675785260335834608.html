      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:58:35+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lady-gaga">Lady Gaga</a> has spoken out about her private mental health struggles and how she conquered her self-harming.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Oscar-winning singer has also revealed how a 'psychotic break' was the 'worst thing that had ever happened to her'.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Oprah Winfrey in an interview for <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29683686/lady-gaga-haus-laboratories-elle-interview/">Elle</a> , Lady Gaga has urged her fans to 'reach out to those you see suffering' and to 'choose kindness' above all else.</p>
      <p>The singer has shared details of her her mental health struggles that she had previously kept private as well as the pain she has carried since being raped as a teenager.</p>
      <p>Gaga told Winfrey: "I have PTSD. I have chronic pain. Neuropathic pain trauma response is a weekly part of my life.</p>
      <p>"I'm on medication; I have several doctors. This is how I survive."</p>

      <p>Gaga has cited her self-determination as proof that you can achieve your dreams if you believe in yourself.</p>
      <p>She continued: "I kept going and that kid out there or even that adult out there who's been through so much, I want them to know that they can keep going, and they can survive, and they can win their Oscar.</p>
      <p>"I would also beckon to anyone to try, when they feel ready, to ask for help.</p>
      <p>"And I would beckon to others that if they see someone suffering, to approach them and say, 'Hey, I see you. I see that you're suffering, and I'm here. Tell me your story.'"</p>

      <p>It is the first time that Gaga has spoken in public about some of the issues that have dogged her during her life.</p>
      <p>This includes a period of time when she was a self-harmer and she spoke about the feelings she had being a 'cutter'.</p>
      <p>Gaga continued: "I've actually not opened up very much about this, but I think it's an important thing for people to know and hear:</p>
      <p>"I was a cutter for a long time, and the only way that I was able to stop cutting and self-harming myself was to realise that what I was doing was trying to show people that I was in pain instead of telling them and asking for help."</p>

      <p>Gaga added: "When I realised that telling someone, 'Hey, I am having an urge to hurt myself,' that defused it.</p>
      <p>"I then had someone next to me saying, 'You don't have to show me. Just tell me: What are you feeling right now?' And then I could just tell my story."</p>
      <p>The singer went on to urge others that have felt like this to seek help to get them through a difficult period in their lives.</p>
      <p>Gaga continued: "I say that with a lot of humility and strength; I'm very grateful that I don't do it anymore, and I wish to not glamorise it.</p>

      <p>"One thing that I would suggest to people who struggle with trauma response or self-harm issues or suicidal ideation is actually ice.</p>
      <p>"If you put your hands in a bowl of ice-cold water, it shocks the nervous system, and it brings you back to reality."</p>
      <p>While self-harm formed a big part of what Gaga wanted to share with the world, she also spoke about "one of the worst things that's ever happened" to her.</p>
      <p>Revealing the details of a "psychotic break", Gaga said: "Although there are many different theories about fibromyalgia - for me, my fibromyalgia and my trauma response kind of go hand in hand.</p>

      <p>"The fibro for me is a lighter pain; the trauma response is much heavier and actually feels the way I felt after I was dropped on a street corner after I'd been raped repeatedly for months. It's a recurring feeling.</p>
      <p>"So I had a psychotic break at one point, and it was one of the worst things that's ever happened to me. I was brought to the ER to urgent care and they brought in the doctor, a psychiatrist."</p>
      <p>Recalling the traumatic event, Gaga said: "So I'm just screaming, and I said, 'Could somebody bring me a real doctor?' And I didn't understand what was going on, because my whole body went numb; I fully dissociated.</p>

      <p>"I was screaming, and then he calmed me down and gave me medication for when that happens."</p>
      <p>Gaga has turned her life around since and has urged others to embrace any help there is.</p>
      <p>She finished by saying: "I once believed that there was no way back from my trauma. I really did. I was in physical, mental, and emotional pain.</p>
      <p>"And medicine works, but you need medicine with the therapy for it to really work, because there's a part that you have to do yourself."</p>
