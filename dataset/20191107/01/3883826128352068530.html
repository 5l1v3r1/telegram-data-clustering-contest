        <b>RuPaul's Drag Race UK, the BBC Three drag queen reality competition, has been commissioned for a second series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first ever UK version of the show is in the middle of its debut season, with the finale on 21 November.</p>
      <p>Drag Race features a regular panel of judges made up of Strictly Come Dancing contestant Michelle Visage, BBC chat show host Graham Norton and comedian Alan Carr.</p>
      <p>The second season of the iPlayer show will air next year.</p>
      <p>"I want to thank the BBC and all our fans for their overwhelming support of RuPaul's Drag Race UK," Emmy Award-winning host RuPaul said.</p>
      <p>"This season's queens proved that Britain's Got Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent - and I want to see more!"</p>
      <p>The US version of the show first aired in 2009, has run for 11 seasons and inspired a number of spin-off shows.</p>
      <p>Season one of the UK version, which began airing in October, has attracted 6.5 million requests on iPlayer just over halfway through the series.</p>
      <p>Celebrity guest judges on the first season have included actor Andrew Garfield, Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall, singer Cheryl and Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams.</p>
      <p>The show sees drag queen contestants - with names such as Baga Chipz, Sum Ting Wong and Divina De Campo - compete in challenges related to drag queen skills, such as singing, acting and comedy.</p>
