      <h1>Elderly man dies after falling into a lava tube in Hawaii</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:47:03+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:47</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Lewis</a></address>
      <p>An elderly man died this week after <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kilauea-volcano-hawaii-man-survives-70-foot-fall-big-island-2019-05-03/">falling into a lava tube</a> on his property in Hilo, Hawaii, police said Wednesday. The victim's identification has not been released because his relatives have not yet been notified.</p>
      <p>Big Island police responded to the Kaumana residence at about 8:30 AM on Monday following a report that the man had not been seen or heard from in several days. <a href="https://www.hawaiipolice.com/11-06-19-hilo-man-dies-following-fall-into-a-lava-tube">According to a press release</a>, officials soon located the elderly victim in a nearby lava tube.</p>
      <p>"It appeared that he had fallen through a soft area of ground into a lava tube on his property," police said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Hawaii Fire Department Rescue personnel repelled into the lava tube to recover the body of the victim, which was about 22 feet below the surface.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/lava-tubes.htm">According to the National Park Service</a>, lava tubes form from lava that flowed for many hours, solidifying on the top and sides of a stream but remaining liquid in the interior for a much longer period of time. After the lava flow stops, a lava tube cave remains, which can be large enough for people to walk through.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to the Hilo Medical Center and pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>An autopsy performed Tuesday confirmed that the victim died as a result of injuries constant with a fall. The investigation is ongoing, but no foul play is suspected, police said.</p>
