      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Computer and printer maker HP Inc. said Wednesday it had received a "proposal" from copier maker Xerox and has had conversations "from time to time" with the company about a potential business combination.</p>
      <p>HP said Wednesday that it received the proposal on Tuesday but did not provide details. It said it will do what is in the best interests of its shareholders.</p>
      <p>Asked for details of the proposal, a Xerox spokeswoman said the company does not comment on "rumors and speculation."</p>
      <p>The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that Xerox was considering making a bid for HP.</p>
      <p>Both companies have faced difficulties as the demand for printed documents and ink have waned. They have both been trying to cut costs to boost results.</p>
