      <p>GAY Byrne created a "safe, non-judgmental space" for his Late Late Show guests, President Michael D Higgins told a special edition of The Late Late Show.</p>
      <p>Mr Byrne (85) is to be laid to rest on Friday. He died on Monday following a long period of ill-health.</p>
      <p>The president said the long-time Late Late Show presenter was "very fair and I think that was impressive".</p>
      <p>He said the landmark Friday night show set the tone for Irish public debate.</p>
      <p>"By Sunday and the weekend he had defined the conversation," Mr Higgins said.</p>
      <p>"I recall meeting him at various theatre events and I always remember how kind he was and he'd always come and say something decent to you."</p>
      <p>RTÃ‰ broadcast a special edition of The Late Late Show on Tuesday night in tribute to Mr Byrne, who presented the programme for 37 years before his departure in 1999.</p>
      <p>The programme heard from guests including Mr Byrne's Late Late Show successor Pat Kenny, musician Bob Geldof, comedian Tommy Tiernan and journalists Eamon Dunphy and Vincent Browne.</p>
      <p>Mr Tiernan said he had only got to know the presenter in the last three years but would often meet him and his friend Harry Crosbie for pizza and whiskey.</p>
      <p>"It was surreal sitting down talking to him because it's almost as if it's an out of body experience," he said.</p>
      <p>"You're doing your work and part of you is thinking, 'Jesus! That's Gay Byrne'. "</p>
      <p>Tuesday's programme ended with a collection of leading musicians, including John Sheahan of The Dubliners, Sharon Shannon, Mary Coughlan and Mary Black, performing The Parting Glass.</p>
      <p>Mr Byrne's funeral will take place at the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin at 11.45am on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Funeral Mass will be led by Irish Jesuit Provincial Fr Leonard Moloney SJ.</p>
      <p>Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin will lead the Prayers of Final Commendation.</p>
      <p>The Archdiocese of Dublin warned any mourners wishing to attend the funeral that access to the Pro-Cathedral will be extremely limited with seating reserved for Mr Byrne's family and friends.</p>
