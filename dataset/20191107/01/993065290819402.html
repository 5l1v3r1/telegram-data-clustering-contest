      <p>A pensioner with a history of exposing himself in public has been remanded in custody.</p>
      <p>Alex Reynolds, from College Avenue in Belfast, appeared at the city's crown court using a walking aid.</p>
      <p>The 72-year old was charged with exposing his genitals 'intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm or distress' on May 18 this year.</p>
      <p>When the charge was put to Reynolds by the clerk and he was asked how he pleaded, the pensioner replied, "Oh I plead guilty, love."</p>
      <p>Defence barrister JonPaul Shields told Judge Philip Gilpin that Reynolds was in custody and there would be no application for bail.</p>
      <p>The barrister also asked for pre-sentence reports, adding that Reynolds was "familiar with probation."</p>
      <p>After the judge was handed a copy of his criminal record - which included previous exposure offences - he told the pensioner: "Mr Reynolds, you have pleaded guilty to these matters. Probation will contact you to discuss the next stage, and it's important to engage with them and discuss matters with them."</p>
      <p>When he was told his plea would be heard on December 5, Reynolds said "that's three days before my birthday".</p>
      <p>He was then remanded back into custody.</p>
