      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/lady-gaga">Lady Gaga</a> opened up about her <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health">mental health</a> struggles in a new interview.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a29683686/lady-gaga-haus-laboratories-elle-interview/">interview</a> with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/oprah-winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>, featured in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/meghan-mccain-blasts-elle-magazine">Elle Magazine’s</a> December issue, the singer -- who has been about open her struggles in the past -- said: "I’ve actually not opened up very much about this, but I think it’s an important thing for people to know and hear: I was a cutter for a long time.”</p>
      <p>“The only way that I was able to stop cutting and self-harming myself was to realize that what I was doing was trying to show people that I was in pain instead of telling them and asking for help," she said.</p>

      <p>Gaga, 33, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lady-gaga-mother-mental-health">her mother</a> have both gone on to become outspoken advocates of mental health.</p>
      <p>“I was raped when I was 19 years old, repeatedly,” Gaga told Oprah. “I have been traumatized in a variety of ways by my career over the years from many different things, but I survived, and I’ve kept going.”</p>
      <p>During the interview, Gaga, whose name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, said she suffers from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/ptsd">post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (PTSD) and chronic pain.</p>
      <p>“Neuropathic pain trauma response is a weekly part of my life," she said. "I’m on medication; I have several doctors. This is how I survive."</p>
      <p>“But you know what, Oprah? I kept going, and that kid out there or even that adult out there who’s been through so much, I want them to know that they can keep going, and they can survive, and they can win their Oscar,” she added.</p>

      <p>Gaga won an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/oscars-2019-bradley-cooper-and-lady-gaga-perform-shallow-from-a-star-is-born">Academy Award</a> for best original song this year for the song “Shallow” from the film "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/bradley-cooper-lady-gaga-a-star-is-born-reunion">A Star is Born.</a>" She starred in the movie with actor <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/bradley-cooper">Bradley Cooper</a>.</p>
      <p>Gaga told Oprah that telling someone she was having the urge to hurt herself defused the situation.</p>
      <p>“I then had someone next to me saying, ‘You don’t have to show me. Just tell me: What are you feeling right now?’ And then I could just tell my story,” Gaga said. “I say that with a lot of humility and strength; I’m very grateful that I don’t do it anymore, and I wish to not glamorize it.”</p>

      <p>She also said: “One thing that I would suggest to people who struggle with trauma response or self-harm issues or suicidal ideation is actually ice. If you put your hands in a bowl of ice-cold water, it shocks the nervous system, and it brings you back to reality.”</p>
      <p>Gaga said she once thought there was no way out of her trauma.</p>
      <p>“I was in physical, mental and emotional pain. And medicine works, but you need medicine with the therapy for it to really work, because there’s a part that you have to do yourself,” she said.</p>

      <p>Gaga also talked about suffering from fibromyalgia, which is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues, according to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780">the Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>
      <p>“For me, my fibromyalgia and my trauma response kind of go hand in hand,” she told Oprah. “The fibro for me is a lighter pain; the trauma response is much heavier and actually feels the way I felt after I was dropped on a street corner after I’d been raped repeatedly for months. It’s a recurring feeling.”</p>
      <p>The musician said that at one point, she had a “psychotic break.”</p>
      <p>“It was one of the worst things that’s ever happened to me,” Gaga told Oprah.</p>

      <p>She said she was then brought to urgent care and was seen by a psychiatrist.</p>
      <p>“So I’m just screaming, and I said, ‘Could somebody bring me a real doctor?’ And I didn’t understand what was going on, because my whole body went numb; I fully dissociated,” Gaga said.</p>
      <p>She said the doctor eventually calmed her down and gave her medication.</p>
      <p>The triple-threat entertainer said that the doctor and all her friends saved her life, adding that she takes a muscle relaxant and a medication used to treat certain mental and mood conditions.</p>
