      <p>BENGALURU: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nandan-Nilekani">Infosys</a> CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salil-Parekh">Salil Parekh</a>, who is the primary target of the whistleblower letter, responded to the accusations for the first time on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>During an analyst call, he said: “As CEO, I have served with commitment and integrity to deliver a major business transformation in a large complex organisation over the past two years. Those who work with me know how I operate with inclusiveness and have no tolerance for divisiveness of any form. I’m grateful and heartened with the personal messages I’ve received from my employees. I have recused myself from the ongoing process and I respect that the audit committee has started an independent investigation.”</p>
      <p>In response to a report that accused an unnamed Infosys co-founder and a former senior executive of conspiring with the whistleblowers, Infosys said it strongly condemns the mischievous insinuations made by anonymous sources against the co-founders and former colleagues.</p>
      <p>Infosys chairman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nandan-Nilekani">Nandan Nilekani</a> said the speculation is appalling and seem to be aimed at tarnishing the image of some of the most accomplished and respected individuals.</p>
      <p>“I have deep regard for the life-long contribution of all our co-founders. They have built this institution and have served this company selflessly and even today, remain committed to the long-term success of Infosys,” he said.</p>
