      <h1>Alex Jones Goes on Tirade Against Roger Stone Jurors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:58:09+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/" target="_blank">Will Sommer</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-is-still-talking-about-the-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory">InfoWars conspiracy theorist</a> and Roger Stone ally Alex Jones stepped up his attacks on the jury at Stone’s trial on Tuesday, broadcasting the name and face of a woman he claimed was a juror at the trial and calling her a “minion” of anti-Trump forces.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got her name, and we’re going to release it,” Jones said on his InfoWars broadcast, before revealing a woman’s name and putting her face on the screen behind him. </p>
      <p>Later in the broadcast, Jones and his attorney were joined by a person dressed as the Grim Reaper and wielding a sickle. Stone hosted a show broadcast on InfoWars until recently, and Jones and his employees have frequently attacked the judge in Stone’s case, Judge Amy Berman Jackson.</p>
      <p>Jones’ attacks on the jury were based on reporting that the first potential juror in the case was a former Obama administration employee in the Office of Management and Budget whose husband works for the Department of Justice. But in his rush to attack the potential juror as a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2017/03/15/roger-stone-deep-state-tried-to-kill-me-by-t-boning-my-car">deep-state</a> plant, Jones appears to have gotten the wrong person.</p>
      <p>During his broadcast, Jones didn’t show a picture of the actual potential juror, who, despite his claims, didn’t make it onto the jury anyway. Instead, he showed a picture of another former OMB staffer who appears to be totally unrelated to the Stone trial. </p>
      <p>This wasn’t Jones’ first attack on the jury—or his first that implied a threat to launch his legions of harassing fans at any jurors who find Stone guilty on witness tampering and obstruction charges. On Monday, he <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/roger-stone/alex-jones-trying-out-identity-potential-roger-stone-trial-juror-help-stones-assistant">tried</a> to convince political operative and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-jacob-engels-roger-stones-mini-me">close Stone associate</a> Jacob Engels to name the juror, reading a list of names of former Obama administration officials and attempting to have Engels confirm which one was on the jury.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Owen Shroyer, an InfoWars employee who used to host a show with Stone, has been broadcasting live from outside the Washington, D.C., courthouse where Stone is being tried. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Jones is facing a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/infowars-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-faces-court-action-after-threatening-sandy-hook-lawyer">number of legal issues of his own</a>, including lawsuits filed by the families of Sandy Hook massacre victims who say Jones’ baseless claims that the shooting was faked provoked waves of harassment and death threats against them.</p>
