      <p>Bill Gates said he remains unsure if he could get Elizabeth Warren to have a conversation with him because of his personal wealth.</p>
      <p>In an interview at the <i>New York Times</i> DealBook Conference, Gates explained his criticism of a tax structure that is too liberal and damages the economy.</p>
      <p>“I do think if you tax too much, you do risk the capital formation, innovation, ‘U.S. is the desirable place to do innovative companies,’ I do think you risk that,” he said.</p>
      <p>Gates acknowledged that he is a “primary beneficiary” of the current tax structure but said he would be concerned if that system changed too much.</p>
      <p>“If I had to pay $20 billion, it’s fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over,” he joked.</p>
      <p>He said that he has not spoken to Warren about her proposed wealth tax, but noted that he is not sure she would be willing to speak to him.</p>

      <p>“You know, I’m not sure how open-minded she is,” Gates said. “Or that she’d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.”</p>
      <p>He was asked if he would vote for Warren over President Trump but refused to say.</p>
      <p>“I’m not gonna, you know, make political declarations,” he said, later adding, “I hope the more professional candidate is an electable candidate.”</p>
