      <h1>West YMCA in Madison open after broken water main</h1>

      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The Lussier Family West YMCA in Madison closed at 2 p.m. Wednesday due to a broken water main, but reopened Wednesday night. </p>
      <p>Madison Water Utility said the city turned off water at around 2:30 p.m. to make repairs. The YMCA and others in the area who use the main were told at noon that the water would be shut off for about three to four hours.</p>
      <p>Only a handful of people in the area are said to be affected, as five addresses in total were impacted.</p>
      <p>The break at YMCA is not likely because of the weather. Madison Water Utility said there is speculation that the broken water main might be a result of <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/madison-water-utility-crews-repairing-broken-water-main-work-expected-to-take-most-of-day/1139248632">an incident that happened at Whitney Way and Gilbert Road</a> earlier this week, as the break caused a sudden change in pressure.</p>
      <p>The main at YMCA is said to be an older system made out of spun cast iron, which is pipe material known for breaking the most often.</p>
      <p>Members can follow the West YMCA's email, social media pages, mobile app and website for updates.</p>
      <p>The YMCA said its regular schedule will resume Thursday morning. </p>
