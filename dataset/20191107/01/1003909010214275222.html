      <h1>Councillors join forces on proposed wage cuts as workers protest outside city hall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:29:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:29</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Calgary city councillors behind two proposals to either freeze or roll back wages for municipal employees are joining forces on a combined pitch to reduce wages that will be debated at a council meeting later this month.</p>
      <p>Council’s finance committee asked proponents <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/councillors-push-for-wage-freezes-rollbacks-in-separate-motions">of the two proposals</a> to work together on a motion that will be presented on Nov. 18. Both proposals rely on city unions agreeing to reopen recently settled contracts granting a wage increase of 1.5 per cent in 2020 after two years of wage freezes.</p>
      <p>“It’s going to be a tough job to try to combine them, but I’m going to give it a shot,” said Coun. Jeromy Farkas, who frames his proposal to cut wages by five per cent as a job-saving strategy.</p>
      <p>“My preference is more of a hard-line position,” he said. “I’m prepared for this council to limit job losses to retirement and attrition, that is achievable with a five per cent reduction. Whereas just forgoing an increase and (implementing a) freeze, I believe does not get council  to a position where we can make that commitment.”</p>

      <p>Farkas and his colleagues, Sean Chu and Joe Magliocca, will have to hash out a new motion with Ward Sutherland and Jeff Davison, who are proposing a freeze on worker wages in 2020.</p>
      <p>The move on council comes as labour unions in the city and across the province are ramping up their opposition to government cuts.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, about 200 union workers, led by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, rallied in front of city hall.</p>

      <p>Union leaders at the demonstration talked about the impact of recent provincial cuts on municipal budgets and provincial services and accused the UCP government of attacking workers.</p>
      <p>“There’s an artificial wedge being driven in by this government between front-line workers and private-sector workers and I think this government needs to have an enemy to justify its existence,” said Guy Smith, president of the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees.</p>
      <p>“They’re looking for enemies and it looks like front-line workers are the enemy of the day.”</p>
      <p>Protesting city workers said the rhetoric from some councillors mirrors recently unveiled UCP government strategy to <a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/government-will-seek-two-per-cent-wage-cuts-from-broad-swath-of-public-sector-workers">cut public sector wages by two to five per cent</a> in upcoming arbitrations.</p>
      <p>“We know that we have allies on city council who want to stand up to Jason Kenney and we know that there are city councillors who want to tuck in their tails and crawl under a rock and do what Jason Kenney says,” CUPE Alberta president Roy Gill said at the protest.</p>
      <p>“We’re here to say that public services matter. We’ll work with anybody on council, anybody who wants to work with us to keep Calgary strong. Those who don’t, we’re not interested.”</p>

      <p>Rick Ratcliff, head of the union that represents transit workers in Calgary, said there have already been job losses among transit workers as a result of municipal budget cuts in 2019. He said he receives texts from union members worried about what’s still to come.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think the members would voluntarily accept rollbacks,” said Ratcliff. “We already just took two years of zeroes. We work our way through the ebbs and tides — we don’t take too much during the boom times and again we don’t expect to take less when we’re in a downturn.”</p>
      <p>Smith compared the current political climate to the battles former premier Ralph Klein fought with organized labour in the 1990s. The AUPE president said he’s preparing his members for possible job action.</p>
      <p>“It looks like they’re itching for a fight. I don’t understand why, but we’ve been preparing our members for it and if it’s a fight they want, it’s a fight they’re going to get, unfortunately.”</p>
