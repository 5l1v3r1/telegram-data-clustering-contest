      <p>A car has been burnt out in south Belfast's Holylands area in the latest in a spate of attacks.</p>
      <p>Police received a report of a car on fire at Collingwood Avenue on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A fortnight ago, five cars were severely damaged in overnight arson attacks along Collingwood Avenue and nearby Damascus Street.</p>
      <p>Three cars were also damaged after being set alight around the same area in the early hours of October 7.</p>
      <p>Police have previously said they were making enquiries into "any potential links" between these earlier attacks.</p>
      <p>They urged anyone with information about the latest incident to phone them on the non-emergency number 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>Police said they are still working to establish the cause of the latest fire.</p>
      <p>"A link to other attacks on cars in recent weeks would be one line of enquiry," a spokeswoman added.</p>
      <p>Last week, a Belfast council committee held a special meeting to discuss anti-social behaviour in the Holylands.</p>
      <p>It was announced that council officers and police would patrol the area over Halloween in a bid to crack down on noise and on-street drinking.</p>
      <p>Complaints of anti-social behaviour in the Holyands area this year have already outstripped figures for the past six years.</p>
      <p>So far this year, 1,491 complaints have been lodged â€“ up almost 60 per cent on the whole of 2013.</p>
      <p>Long-term residents have frequently complained of anti-social behaviour fuelled by an "oversaturation" of students living in the area.</p>
      <p>Belfast City Council has said it works with residents, the PSNI and universities and colleges to address anti-social behaviour.</p>
