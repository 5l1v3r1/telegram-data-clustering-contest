      <h1>Not so crafty Genesis as bakery gets new look</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T01:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">GARY MCDONALD</a></address>
      <p>A SOUTH Derry business saved from administration 15 months ago has undergone a change of image.</p>
      <p>Just weeks after announcing expansion plans and a major recruitment campaign, the once family-run Genesis bakery in Magherafelt, formerly known as Genesis Crafty, has dropped the ‘crafty’ name and changed its strapline to 'Genesis - Baking it better since ’68'.</p>
      <p>Belfast design agency Thought Collective was commissioned to manage the rebrand, which follows the announcement that Genesis is investing £750,000 in the business and recruiting an additional 35 staff.</p>
      <p>The new identity is also being supported with an improved and expanded product offering and newer 'greener' packaging.</p>
      <p>The firm's executive chairman Paul Allen, who acquired the business in August last year when it went into administration, saving nearly 300 jobs, said: “We've been listening to customer feedback and have introduced a fresh, bold contemporary new look.</p>
      <p>“Customers love our products’ traditional credentials, and with new eye-catching packaging, they will be able to see exactly what they are getting. We've also developed new recipes, with an increased shelf life and even better taste.”</p>
      <p>The firm's commercial director JP Lyttle added: “We are committed to maintaining high-quality standards and developing innovative product ranges, and have successfully reasserted Genesis’ position as an established industry leader.</p>
      <p>“This refreshed identity, supported by an extensive sampling campaign, new creative point of sale, digital, consumer and trade PR, will undoubtedly further build market share.”</p>
      <p>Sam Bell, creative director with Thought Collective, said: “‘Baking it better since ’68’ was conceived to encapsulate the company’s heritage as well as its vision for the future - it’s the rally cry for a team of innovative master bakers.”</p>
      <p>Genesis products are sold in more than 700 stores across the north, and it also produces a range of bread and cakes for many of the UK's largest and most prestigious retailers including Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose.</p>
