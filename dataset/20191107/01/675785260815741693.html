      <h2>Thousands have travelled to Italian capital for Thursday's game despite fears of violence from Lazio 'ultras'</h2>

      <p>Two Celtic supporters have been stabbed in an Irish bar in Rome ahead of Thursday's Europa League clash against Lazio.</p>
      <p>Fans were in Flann O’Brien's in the Italian capital on Wednesday night when they were reportedly targeted, according to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/two-celtic-fans-stabbed-rome-20829537">Daily Record</a>.</p>
      <p>Police said two <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> fans had been stabbed but their injuries were not life-threatening, and they remain in hospital.</p>
      <p>The incident is being investigated by police.</p>
      <p>A video posted on Twitter which contains strong language also showed hooligans trying to smash in the windows of a bar which had Scottish fans inside.</p>

      <p>Thousands of Celtic fans have travelled to Rome for Thursday's game despite fears of violence from Lazio 'ultras'.</p>
      <p>Celtic fans were advised by the Foreign Office not to wear their club colours while visiting Rome after their side's 2-1 win over Lazio in Glasgow last month.</p>
      <p>Ahead of that game, a group of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ss-lazio">Lazio</a> football fans were caught on camera <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/lazio-fans-make-fascist-salute-20718359">performing fascist salutes</a> as they marched through the city.</p>

      <p>The Italian Serie A side are already on a final warning from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/uefa">UEFA</a> after they made a similar gesture during their previous European game versus French side Rennes.</p>
      <p>Celtic’s own ultra fans, The Green Brigade, countered by making a massive banner depicting fascist leader Benito Mussolini hanging upside down - depicting how he was treated after his death in Milan in 1945.</p>
      <p>Its message of 'follow your leader' brought a UEFA charge for Celtic and led the club to believe the provocation might put fans in danger.</p>
      <p>Celtic FC issued detailed guidance on fan safety after considering that the potential risks in Rome exceeded anything else the club has faced in recent years.</p>
      <p>The Glasgow club are top of Europa League Group E ahead of Thursday's game, which kicks off at 5.55pm.</p>
      <p>Lazio are four points behind in third place with three games remaining, while Romanian club Cluj are one point behind Celtic and play bottom side Rennes on Thursday evening.</p>
