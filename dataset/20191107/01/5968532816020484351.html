      <p>Hackers are more skilled than ever. All they want to do is steal your information, whatever it takes. Get defensive and <b>kick your cybersecurity up a notch</b> with a <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance Smart Antivirus</a> two-year subscription for <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">only $29</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance</a> is<b> more advanced</b> than traditional antivirus software. It does not rely on byte matching or heuristics to spot a hacker, but rather <b>advanced machine learning</b> to protect your system. It only makes sense to use <b>advanced antivirus to beat advanced hackers</b>.</p>
      <blockquote>Set it, forget it, and protect your digital presence.</blockquote>
      <p>The worst part about traditional antivirus software is the tendency to run a scan at the most inconvenient time. You’re gaming or watching a movie, you get a security popup, and suddenly your system is at a crawl. <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance</a> runs <b>quietly in the background</b>, taking down threats before they can <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/new-malware-tries-infect-android-devices-via-usb-cable-339356/">infect</a> your computer.</p>
      <p>One of the most secure benefits of <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance</a> is that it operates <b>independently of the cloud</b>. Nobody can access flaws in your security when your system is tightly contained. <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance</a> works with <b>any operating system </b>from Windows 7 or Mac OS X Mavericks onward.</p>
      <h3>Cylance Smart Antivirus highlights:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Prevention focused design stops threats at runtime</b>.</li>
        <li><b>AI-based predictive advantage protects against never-before-seen threats</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Runs without popups, scans, or performance impacts</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Get a bird’s eye view of your system from an intuitive interface</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Operates on your device independently of the cloud</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>McAfee security can cost up to $100 per year, and Norton can cost $60 per year, but neither one offers the advanced AI features of <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance Smart Antivirus</a>. A<b> two-year subscription</b> to <a href="https://andauth.co/Cylance">Cylance</a> retails at $58, but this deal provides all of that protection for <b>just $29</b>.</p>
