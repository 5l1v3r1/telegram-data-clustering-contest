        <b>BACK IN THE DAY</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Irish News: - November 7 2009:</b> Paul McCloskey announced himself on the European boxing scene last night as the Dungiven man sauntered his way to the European light welterweight championship title with a ninth-round knockout of Spain’s Daniel Rasilla.</p>
      <p>Three thousand people, including Tyrone manager Mickey Harte, packed the Meadowbank Sports Arena in Magherafelt to roar on ‘Dudey’, and the 30-year-old returned the compliment with the minimum of fuss in front of the Sky Sports cameras, knocking Rasilla out two minutes and 15 seconds into the ninth.</p>
      <p>Rasilla, a last minute replacement for France's ex-world champion Souleymane M'baye, who pulled out at the start of the week, offered little resistance throughout.</p>
      <p>He didn’t rattle the southpaw and McCloskey needed just two more rounds to become the first Derryman to be crowned a European champion since Charlie Nash claimed the European lightweight title in 1979.</p>
      <p>But there was disappointment for Belfast’s Martin Rogan as his bid to win back the Commonwealth heavyweight title from Sam Sexton ended in despair after he</p>
      <p>was forced to retire at the end of the sixth round at the Odyssey in Belfast.</p>
