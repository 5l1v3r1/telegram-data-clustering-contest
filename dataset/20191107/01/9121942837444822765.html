The air quality index stood at 273 on Thursday after authorities declared a health emergency last weekend when the index crossed 500 _ 10 times the level considered healthy by WHO standards.

      <p>AMRITSAR, India (AP) — Indian farmers say they’re being unfairly criticized for causing the worst air pollution in the capital because of the burning of stubbles in the fields.</p>
      <p>The air quality index stood at 273 on Thursday after authorities declared a health emergency last weekend when the index crossed 500 — 10 times the level considered healthy by WHO standards.</p>
      <p>Despite a ban on stubble burning, farmers say they have no choice but to set fire to the crop residue.</p>
      <p>Farmers in Haryana and Punjab states traditionally resort to stubble burning during the months of October and November as a cheap way of clearing their fields after harvesting the crops.</p>
      <p>This year’s record pollution has also been aggravated by smog from festival fireworks.</p>
