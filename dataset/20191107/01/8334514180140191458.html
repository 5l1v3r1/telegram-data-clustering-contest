      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House committees leading the impeachment probe of Republican President Donald Trump released a transcript on Wednesday of the deposition of Ambassador William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Taylor’s testimony, delivered behind closed doors on Oct. 22, was considered some of the most damaging to the Trump administration to date, as he outlined how it was leveraging nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of the Republican president’s political rival.</p>
