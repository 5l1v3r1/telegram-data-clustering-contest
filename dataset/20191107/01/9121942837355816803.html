      <p>PARIS (AP) — A French court has quashed the charges of “complicity in crimes against humanity” pressed against French cement company Lafarge, but says the judicial proceedings over Syria funding deals can continue.</p>
      <p>A Paris appeal court maintained Thursday other charges against the company as a legal entity including financing a terrorist enterprise, violation of an embargo and endangering others.</p>
      <p>Lafarge has acknowledged funneling money to Syrian armed organizations in 2013 and 2014 — allegedly including the Islamic State group — to guarantee safe passage for employees and to supply its plant in the war-torn country.</p>
      <p>Eight officials with Lafarge were also handed charges for their alleged roles in the process.</p>
      <p>The wrongdoing precedes Lafarge’s merger with Swiss company Holcim in 2015 to create LafargeHolcim, the world’s largest cement maker.</p>
