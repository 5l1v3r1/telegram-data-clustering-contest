      <p>"ok boomer."<br/><br/>This two-word insult <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ok-boomer">that likely originated on the social media app TikTok</a> has spread beyond the Gen Z-occupied corners of the internet, becoming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/06/ok-boomer-meme-older-generations">the subject of several think pieces </a>and even inspiring T-shirt designs.<br/><br/>As the name suggests, the retort dismisses or mocks Baby Boomers, the generation of adults born post-World War II between 1946 and 1965, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/ok-boomer/">according to Dictionary.com</a>.<br/><br/>More specially, those classified as Gen Zers and millennials use "ok boomer" to respond to the slew of criticism directed toward their generations and issues that matter to them.<br/><br/>An older man rants about young people who "don't ever want to grow up"? "ok boomer."<br/><br/>An uncle is dismissive about the high cost of college tuition? "ok boomer."<br/><br/>This phenomenon even crept into the political sphere. As an older New Zealand lawmaker heckled a younger colleague, Chloe Swarbrick, during a speech to support a climate crisis bill, the 25-year-old fired back with an "OK, boomer," and continued, unfazed.</p>

      <p>While this phrase stayed on the peripheries of the internet for a few months, an Oct. 29 New York Times article titled "'OK Boomer' Marks the End of Friendly Generational Relations" gave it colloquial recognition, according to Know Your Meme, a community-curated website that documents internet culture.<br/><br/>Its popularity among younger generations has produced backlash, with some calling it ageist and <a href="https://abc7.com/society/radio-host-catching-heat-for-comparing-ok-boomer-to-n-word/5674529/">a Rochester radio host comparing it to the n-word</a>. Young people on the internet's response? "ok boomer."</p>
