      <h1>Popeyes employee, customer throw trays at each other in fight caught on video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T23:57:52+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>Trays were sent flying at a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-woman-scraping-car">Popeyes </a>restaurant in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">San Antonio </a>on Tuesday during a fight between a customer and an employee.</p>
      <p>The two unidentified women are seen throwing food trays at each other in a dispute caught on video and posted on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The woman who filmed the altercation said she was in line to pick up some of Popeyes’ popular chicken sandwiches when a woman who she believes was initially in the drive-thru line came in through a side door.</p>

      <p>A man wearing a veteran’s hat is seen in the video holding the customer back and pulling her away.</p>
      <p>"The veteran took the lady outside and the manager followed them outside ... and they physically got into a fistfight," Valarie said of the customer and manager.</p>

      <p>That altercation wasn't caught on video, she said.</p>
      <p>The tray melee happened just one day before a man was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/28-year-old-man-fatally-stabbed-at-maryland-popeyes-after-fight-over-chicken-sandwich-police-confirm">stabbed </a>to death outside of a Popeyes restaurant in Maryland.</p>
      <p>Police say the stabbing occurred after an altercation that began when one of the men cut a special line reserved for the much sought-after chicken sandwich.</p>
