      <p>Bloomberg said in March that he had decided against running for president in 2020. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-president-2020.html">The New York Times</a>, which first reported the expected Alabama filing, reports Bloomberg has been privately weighing a presidential bid for weeks but has not yet made a final decision.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg dispatched staffers to Alabama to get enough signatures to qualify for the primary there, according to the Times. Alabama does not hold an early primary, but the deadline for a candidate to formally enter the race is Friday, according to the newspaper.</p>
