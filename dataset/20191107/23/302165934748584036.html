      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 8 — After announcing the vehicle years ago, Elon Musk revealed Wednesday in a tweet that the “cyberpunk” Tesla pickup truck will be officially unveiled on November 21.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has not been shy about talking up the company’s very first pickup truck; he’s described the model as “futuristic-like cyberpunk,” “an armoured personnel carrier from the future,” “heart-stopping,” and “the coolest car [he’s] ever seen.” After all this hype, Musk announced Wednesday that the time has finally come: The “Cybertruck” will officially be unveiled on November 21 in LA.</p>

      <p>Accompanying the tweet published by Musk on Wednesday revealing this information was a clip of the opening titles of <i>Blade Runner</i>, the movie that seems to be one of Musk’s primary design inspirations for the vehicle. In terms of design, the best look Musk offered was published back in March; however, the image of the truck is too obscure to make sense of even at this point.</p>

      <p>In the past, Musk has revealed a handful of specs about the cybertruck including its starting price of about US$50,000 (RM206,200), distance range up to 500 miles, and a dual motor all-wheel drive with “crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load.” It’s expected to have power outlets integrated into the body that can power heavy duty power tools without a generator.</p>
      <p>In any case, the entire vehicle and any variants will finally have the wraps taken off in just a few weeks. Considering Musk’s tweet history, it’s likely to best to take his publications about the specs with a grain of salt. The official details will be unveiled on November 21. — AFP-Relaxnews</p>
