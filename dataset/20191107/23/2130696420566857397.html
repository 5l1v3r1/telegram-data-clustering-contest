      <p>MAINBOARD-LISTED early childhood education player MindChamps PreSchool saw third-quarter earnings plummet on surging expenses, despite a swell in turnover from new pre-schools in its stable.</p>
      <p>Net profit for the three months to Sept 30 fell by 73.1 per cent year on year, to S$300,000, according to results released on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>MindChamps, which is 20 per cent-owned by The Business Times publisher Singapore Press Holdings, was sorely hit by not just a drop in interest income, but also a hike in administrative expenses - which almost doubled, to S$7.33 million - and finance costs.</p>
      <p>The expenditure eroded the gains from a 70 per cent jump in revenue, to S$15.6 million, that had come on the back of higher income from school fees with the acquisition of new centres.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share stood at 0.12 Singapore cent, against 0.46 Singapore cent before.</p>

      <p>MindChamps disclosed in its financial statements that the higher administrative expenses involved rents, utilities, maintenance and other day-to-day running costs from the new acquisitions, while part of the increase in non-operating finance expenses was attributed to servicing the acquisition loans.</p>
      <p>For the nine months, net profit was down by 61.6 per cent to S$1.04 million, even as revenue grew by 66.8 per cent to S$38.1 million.</p>
      <p>The company added in its outlook statement that a share purchase and subscription agreement with a Singapore franchisee on Nov 1 is not expected to have any material negative impact on the consolidated earnings and net tangible assets per share for the year to Dec 31.</p>
      <p>No dividend was recommended for the quarter, unchanged from the year before, with the company saying that it planned to re-invest the profits from the current financial period.</p>
      <p>MindChamps closed flat at S$0.55, before the results were released.</p>
