      <p>Polish Tourism and Sports Minister Witold Banka was officially appointed as the next president of the World Anti-Doping Agency on Thursday, succeeding outgoing Craig Reedie on Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>KATOWICE, Poland: Polish Tourism and Sports Minister Witold Banka was officially appointed as the next president of the World Anti-Doping Agency on Thursday, succeeding outgoing Craig Reedie on Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old Banka, a former track and field athlete, was the public authorities' choice for WADA president, as the post rotates between a choice from sports bodies and one from public authorities.</p>

      <p>Banka, whose appointment was rubber-stamped by the body's Foundation Board on the final day of the world conference on doping in sport, has pledged to attempt to eradicate doping, a lofty goal with WADA currently locked in one of the biggest scandals to hit world sport.</p>
      <p>For more than four years Russia has been the focus of several investigations and sanctions after a 2015 WADA-commissioned report highlighted a vast doping network in the country's sports community.</p>
      <p>"We have the same objective and goals in our hearts, to clean up sport and create a fair environment," Banka said in a brief address after a unanimous election.</p>
      <p>"I promise you to try to always build bridges with all stakeholders. I am sure together we will make anti-doping systems stronger."</p>
      <p>WADA also approved a revision of its World Anti-Doping Code which will enter into force on Jan. 1, 2021 after a two-year consultation process.</p>
      <p>Among the changes are considerably lower sanctions for the use of illicit drugs, taken not to enhance performances but for recreational purposes, such as marijuana and cocaine.</p>
      <p>Athletes will be banned for weeks instead of years for such an anti-doping rule violation if they can establish that the use of such banned substances was unrelated to their sport performance.</p>
      <p>Successful completion of a rehab treatment programme can further reduce the suspension.</p>
