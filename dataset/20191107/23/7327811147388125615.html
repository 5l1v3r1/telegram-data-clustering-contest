      <p>Forky, the breakout star of "Toy Story 4," is getting his own series on the new Disney+ streaming service that's launching next week.</p>
      <p>Actor Tony Hale said the opportunity to bring the humble spork-turned-toy character to life on screen was both amazing and overwhelming.</p>
      <p>Hale said it was an easy decision when he was asked to continue voicing the character for the "Forky Asks A Question" series on Disney+.</p>
      <p>"I'm crazy about this character and I'm crazy about Pixar," Hale said.</p>

      <p>"Forky was made simply, he looks at things very simply and the shorts are very simple questions," Hale said about the new series.</p>
      <p>Hale said the episodes are "done beautifully and they're funny and it's a very simple format much like him."</p>
