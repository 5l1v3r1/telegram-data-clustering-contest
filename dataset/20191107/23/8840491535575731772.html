      <p>THE Mayo GAA County Board has issued a brief statement tonight following an emergency meeting of the organisation in Castlebar which lasted over four hours.</p>
      <p>The meeting was called to deal with claims by a number of clubs that contrary to a statement issued by the board after last Monday's meeting held in camera, a vote of confidence was not passed in the officer board.</p>
      <p>Tonight's statement did not make any reference to the issue or the fact the board has been investigating reports that Monday's meeting was recorded by a person in attendance and circulated.</p>
      <p>It stated: "The meeting discussed a number of topics with a range of views being expressed by all in attendance.</p>
      <p>"Following this, all clubs and the board are now looking forward to working together for the betterment of Mayo GAA from now on and in 2020."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if clubs abide by a board request not to issue statements on social media in relation to county board business.</p>
      <p>This appeal was made after seven clubs challenged a statement issued by the board after Monday's meeting and did so via social media platforms.</p>
      <p>The board has been instructed by its legal advisors to refrain from public comment on its widely publicised dispute with the Mayo GAA International Supporters Club which is withholding €250,000, raised at a function in New York last May, due to concerns over governance issues.</p>
