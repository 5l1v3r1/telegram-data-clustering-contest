      <p>Specifically, on <i>Hot Gospel Songs</i>, Ye’s ‘Jesus Is King’ tracks occupy the top 11 songs (the total number on the album).</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/kanye-west-ties-eminem-consecutive-number-one-albums-2564289">West has equalled Eminem’s record for having the most consecutive Number One albums in the US</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Jesus Is King’ debuted at Number One on the <i>Billboard 200</i> albums chart last month, making it his ninth consecutive Number One album. Eminem’s run stretches from his release of ‘The Marshall Mathers LP’ in 2000 to last year’s surprise release, <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/eminem-kamikaze-review">‘Kamikaze’</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<i> NME’s</i> Jordan Bassett praised Ye’s ninth studio album. In a <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review">four-star review</a>, he wrote that “an iconoclast sounds peaceful and fulfilled on this jubilant gospel collection”.</p>
