      <p>NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (WABC) -- Two young children were reunited with their mother in Connecticut after a car thief left them on the side of the road.</p>
      <p>Police say the mom left the two children, a 9-month-old girl and her 5-year-old brother, in the car parked outside a school Wednesday night in New Haven while she went inside to get a third child.</p>
      <p>She came out to find her car -- and her kids -- gone.</p>
      <p>Good Samaritan Kasandra Monteiro later found the children nearly four miles away huddled on the side of the road.</p>
      <p>"I got out of the car and then went straight to them," she <a href="https://www.wtnh.com/news/car-stolen-with-kids-inside-new-haven-police-confirm/">told ABC affiliate WTNH</a>. "I was with my phone ready calling 911 saying that there's two kids on the side and asking them if they're OK and then brought them into the car."</p>
      <p>She said the 9-month-old was still in her car seat and was being guarded by her big brother.</p>
      <p>"He looked like a brave little boy," Monteiro told WTNH. "He was holding on to his sister like he was protecting her."</p>
      <p>Police are still looking for the gray/black Mercedes 2015 SUV involved, and a male with a gray hoodie.</p>
      <p>The children were taken to the hospital for evaluation but are said to be OK.</p>
      <p>New Haven police and the Department of Children and Families are investigating.</p>
