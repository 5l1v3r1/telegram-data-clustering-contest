      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 8): Global passenger traffic results for September 2019 showing that demand (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) climbed 3.8% compared to the same month last year, broadly unchanged from August’s performance, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).</p>
      <p>In a statement Nov 7, IATA said capacity (available seat kilometers or ASKs) increased by 3.3%, and load factor climbed 0.4% percentage point to 81.9%, which was a record for any September.</p>
      <p>IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said September marked the eighth consecutive month of below average demand growth.</p>
      <p>“Given the environment of declining world trade activity and tariff wars, rising political and geopolitical tensions and a slowing global economy, it is difficult to see the trend reversing in the near term,” he said.</p>
