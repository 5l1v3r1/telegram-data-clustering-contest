      <h1>Trump news: Giuliani accused of 'campaign of lies' in impeachment inquiry, as president ordered to pay $2m over misuse of foundation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T23:49:14+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 23:49</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Sommerlad</a></address>
      <p>The House <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> interviewed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mike-pence">Mike Pence</a> special adviser <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jennifer-williams">Jennifer Williams</a>, a specialist on European and Russian affairs who listened in on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>’s “quid pro quo” call with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, after issuing a subpoena commanding her to appear, circumventing White House objections to her giving testimony.</p>
      <p>The president has meanwhile angrily denounced as “degenerate” a <i>Washington Post</i> report that he asked his attorney general, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/william-barr">William Barr</a>, to declare publicly that the Zelensky call of 25 July contained no illegality, only for Mr Barr to decline.</p>
      <p>House investigators released the transcript of their interview with Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, who accused Mr Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani of leading a campaign of “lies and deceit” against former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr Giuliani is lawyering up as federal investigators look into whether he violated lobbying laws in his attempts to dig up dirt on Mr Trump's political rivals.</p>
      <p>Next week, the first televised witness testimonies in the impeachment proceedings begin with Bill Taylor, whose damning testimony contradicted the so-called quid pro quo arrangement between Mr Trump and Ukraine.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Mr Taylor and Mr Kent appear on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>On Friday, viewers will hear from Ms Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>In another blow to Mr Trump, a judge has ordered he must personally pay $2m following a lawsuit from the New York Attorney General alleging that his now-dissolved foundation twas used as a personal "chequebook" for his political and personal dealings. Last year, the president said on Twitter that he "won't settle" the case and called it a political attack from "sleazy" New York Democrats.</p>
      <p>At a rally in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Louisiana">Louisiana</a> on Wednesday night, Mr Trump attacked the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrats">Democrats</a> as “totalitarian”, labelling the inquiry into his conduct in office a “hoax” and reviving his attack on 2020 candidate <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, again deriding her claim to Native American heritage by labelling her “Pocahontas”.</p>

        <p>(Michael Reynolds/EPA)<br/> <br/>"The DoJ did in fact release a statement about the call, and the claim that it resulted in tension because it wasn’t a news conference is completely false," one official quoted by <i>The Post</i> said.<br/> <br/>Another said the relationship between Trump and Barr involved the latter keeping a “healthy” distance.<br/> <br/>“My take is that Barr hasn’t changed one bit, that he has had a healthy distance from the beginning,” the source told <i>The Post</i>. “He knows the parameters of the relationship between a president and an AG.”<br/> <br/>Trump, naturally, wasted no time in denouncing the story.</p>

"Those open hearings will be an opportunity for the American people to evaluate the witnesses for themselves, to make their own determinations about the credibility of the witnesses, but also to learn firsthand about the facts of the president's misconduct."<br/> <br/>Along with Taylor, the public will hear from former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whom Trump fired after what she and others say was a smear campaign, as well as career State Department official George Kent.<br/> <br/>Taylor and Kent will appear on Wednesday, Yovanovitch on Friday.<br/> <br/>A 324-page transcript of Taylor’s deposition to investigators was also released on Wednesday, in which Mr Taylor agrees a quid pro quo was in play and frets about the administration’s strategy of withholding military assistance.<br/> <br/>Taylor, a career envoy and war veteran with 50 years of service to the US, told investigators that an "irregular channel" operated by Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was set up to handle Ukraine diplomacy in the wake of the ousting of Yovanovitch and how the White House was holding up almost $400m (£311m) in aid.<br/> <br/>This exchange with Chairman Schiff was particularly revealing:<br/> <br/>Taylor: "That was my clear understanding, security assistance money would not come until the president committed to pursue the investigation."<br/>Schiff: "So if they don't do this, they are not going to get that was your understanding?"<br/>Taylor: "Yes, sir."<br/>Schiff: "Are you aware that quid pro quo literally means this for that?"Taylor: "I am."<br/>The acting charges d'affaires also discussed the president’s unsuccessful and much derided proposal to buy Greenland. “It took up a lot of energy in the [National Security Council],” he lamented.<br/> <br/>Here's Clark Mindock's report.<br/> </p>

"Somebody is saving on air conditioning," Trump joked. "That's all right. You've always got to save a little money. You go home and you lose about nine pounds and you say, 'What happened?’”<br/> <br/>Ignoring his failure to save unpopular GOP governor Matt Bevin in deep red Kentucky earlier this week, the president used his address to attack the Democrats as “totalitarian”, branding the impeachment inquiry a “hoax” and reviving his attack on 2020 candidate Elizabeth Warren, again deriding her claim to Native American heritage by labelling her “Pocahontas”.<br/> <br/>"The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, smears, slanders and scams. The Democrats' shameful conduct has created an angry majority. And that's what we are," Trump whined. "We're a majority, and we're angry, that will vote the do-nothing Democrats out of office in 2020."<br/> <br/>Bizarrely, Trump was joined on stage by the stars of reality TV show <i>Duck Dynasty</i>, Phil and Willie Robertson, who insisted the president "gets our lifestyle".<br/> <br/>For his part, Rispone said at the rally: "We need a pro-Trump, good servant. Someone who is not beholden to special interests... someone like Trump."<br/> <br/>A longtime Republican donor and the owner of an industrial contracting firm who has poured millions of dollars of his money into the campaign, Rispone has avoided specifics about what he would do in office as far as possible so far but regularly compares himself to Trump in his TV adverts, declaring both are "conservative outsiders."<br/> <br/>Edwards, a former state lawmaker and military veteran, has downplayed national issues in favour of a defence of his own performance at a local level. Both anti-abortion and pro-gun, Edwards in many ways doesn't match the platform of the national Democratic Party. But he holds positions that helped him draw support in 2015 from the Republican and independent voters he needs to win again.<br/> <br/>Here’s Andrew Buncombe’s report on the evening’s events.<br/> </p>

"What's happening here is another erosion of the values of this republic for political expediency."<br/> <br/>But, under Senate rules, any member can attempt to pass a bill and any senator can attempt to block them in return.<br/> <br/>Paul did so, declaring: "I support whistleblowers, and I do think they have a role to play in keeping government accountable... but what we have seen over the last few years is that we have a system that we should continue to refine."<br/> <br/>He also had some legislation of his own to propose instead: "The bill I will introduce today will expand the whistleblower act [and] would be made retroactive so Edward Snowden can come home to live in his own country. All he did was expose that his government was not obeying the Constitution."<br/> <br/>Hirono responded that she had not had time to read Paul's bill as it "was just dropped on my lap literally just now" and added that she was "flabbergasted" that he would seek to apply Sixth Amendment principles (right to a fair trial, lawyer etc.) to impeachment proceedings against a president.<br/> <br/>Alt-right figures online, including Don Jr and Sebastian Gorka, have already circulated the name of the person they believe to be the whistleblower, risking compromising their personal safety to win likes from conspiracy theorists.</p>

His many opponents online were quick to note that challenger Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot, is outpacing him in fundraising terms at an alarming rate, which bears ill with an election just one year away.</p>
