      <p>A man who was arrested by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> police has been found dead in the back of a police car while being taken to a watch house.</p>
      <p>Police arrested the 46-year-old early on Friday morning over an incident involving a 33-year-old woman in a Rockhampton hotel car park.</p>
      <p>“Officers arrested the Rockhampton man for breach of a domestic violence order,” a police statement said.</p>
      <p>“Initial investigations indicate the man struggled with police before being restrained and transported to Rockhampton watch house.”</p>
      <p>But he was found unresponsive in the back of the police vehicle when it arrived at the watch house around 3.50am and was declared dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The state coroner has been notified and the Crime and Corruption Commission will oversee a Queensland police investigation into the incident.</p>
