      <h1>11-Year-Old and Four-Time Cancer Survivor Granted Shopping Spree</h1>
      <h2>An 11-year-old girl who beat cancer four times got the opportunity to go on a shopping spree of a lifetime at a Burlington store in Virginia on Tuesday.</h2>

      <p>Eleanor Brooks, who first was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of two, got $150 to spend on a shopping spree at Burlington on Tuesday, courtesy of Burlington and the Virginia Chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.</p>
      <p>“She was diagnosed the first time when she was two, and (after) two and a half years of chemo, there was no evidence of the disease, and then she was off treatment for two years, and then she relapsed again,” Eleanor’s mother, Aronne Brooks <a href="https://www.nbc12.com/2019/11/05/young-cancer-survivor-gifted-shopping-spree/">told</a> WWBT.</p>
      <p>Eleanor had a brain tumor removed, as well as bone marrow transplants before her cancer went into remission.</p>
      <p>“It’s exhausting and heartbreaking but you just have to keep going,” she added.</p>
      <p>And as for Eleanor, she did keep going, up and down the aisles of Burlington’s girls’ clothing section.</p>
      <p>“That’s cute, I like this one!” she said looking over clothes.</p>
      <p>Even though the gift was meant for her, Eleanor’s gut instinct was to give a portion of her shopping spree to her siblings.</p>
      <p>“I’m not just going to use this on myself,” she said.</p>
      <p>Eleanor is not the first cancer survivor to get a chance at a once in a lifetime experience.</p>
      <p>A three-year-old cancer survivor known as the “Mighty Quinn” got the chance to <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2019/10/30/3-year-old-cancer-survivor-mighty-quinn-drops-puck-at-bruins-game/">drop</a> the first puck at a Boston Bruins game last week.</p>
