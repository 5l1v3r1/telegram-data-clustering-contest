      <p>Officers responded to a report of a vehicle striking a pedestrian on Warwood Avenue in Wheeling at around 6:30 a.m. When they arrived on scene, they did not find the victim.</p>
      <p>Less than 30 minutes later, they received another 911 call reporting a vehicle that appeared to be dragging a body on Interstate 70.</p>

      <p>The driver of the second car was alerted by a passing driver who saw the body. The victim has since been identified as Michelle Lynn Czoka, 54, of Bridgeport, Ohio.</p>
      <p>“They made a call saying that they witnessed a body underneath a vehicle being drug along the exit ramp,” Wheeling police spokesman Officer Philip Stahl told <a href="http://wvmetronews.com/2019/11/07/wheeling-police-woman-struck-by-truck-dragged-miles-by-another-vehicle/">West Virginia MetroNews</a>. “They waved down the motorist and made them stop.”</p>
      <p>Both drivers have been found, but the incident remains under investigation.</p>
