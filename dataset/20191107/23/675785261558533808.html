      <p>Things take a violent turn for Mel Owen and best friend Lisa Fowler in the next episode of EastEnders.</p>
      <p>With Mel's revenge against the Mitchells escalating, Lisa steps in only to pay the price when Mel attacks her.</p>
      <p>The troubled character is seen hitting her friend across the face in front of everyone in the Square.</p>
      <p>It comes as Lisa finally tires of her recent behaviour, with Mel continuing to suffocate Lisa's pregnant daughter Louise Mitchell - trying to get her, Lisa and Keanu Taylor to flee to Portugal with her.</p>
      <p>But her behaviour, including her brutal blackmailing of Sharon Mitchell, is only gaining her more enemies.</p>

      <p>Lisa grows tired of Mel trying to act like Louise's mother, recently buying the character a car for her eighteenth birthday, while also meddling in her life.</p>
      <p>She ends up giving her close friend some home truths, hitting out at her, but she's not expecting the reaction.</p>
      <p>As Lisa tells her to back off, Mel slaps her across the face with absolutely no remorse.</p>

      <p>Onlookers including Lola Pearce look shocked by the incident, while Lisa herself is seen reeling - but what will it mean for the characters gong forward?</p>
      <p>It comes after fans predicted Lisa might team up with son-in-law Keanu to take Mel down - with Mel currently threatening to expose his secret affair with Louise's stepmother Sharon, along with the fact he's the real father of her unborn baby.</p>
      <p>Lisa and Keanu were not impressed with Mel getting Louise a car, unable to compete with Mel's extravagant gifting.</p>

      <p>Mel even mocked Keanu's sweet bracelet, containing Louise's birth stone, claiming it was small.</p>
      <p>As Keanu looked more and more angry, he wasn't the only one as Lisa also had a face like thunder.</p>
      <p>It was clear neither character was up for taking Mel's behaviour any longer.</p>
      <p>With Keanu and Sharon's affair and baby secret soon to be exposed, and rumours of a deadly car crash for Mel, it looks as though things are about to get explosive.</p>
