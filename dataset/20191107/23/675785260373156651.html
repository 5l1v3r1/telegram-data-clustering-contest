      <h1>Cheryl 'feared' son Bear would be 'swapped' at hospital after birth</h1>
      <h2>The former Girls Aloud singer said she refused to let doctors take Bear after hearing nightmarish tale</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T23:38:05+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 23:38</time> by <a rel="author">Sara-Aisha Kent, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sara-aisha-kent/</a></address>
      <p>Cheryl has told that she "feared" her and ex beau Liam Payne's son Bear was going to be swapped with another baby in hospital after he was born.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> judge, 36, who welcomed her first child in March 2017, opened up on being "irrational" postpartum during an interview on Ru Paul and Michelle Visage’s podcast What’s The Tea.</p>
      <p>The Geordie shared: “When I had him, first of all I wouldn’t let the doctors take him out of the room.</p>
      <p>“I read this story about two girls being swapped at birth and it was playing on my mind.”</p>
      <p>The Three Words hitmaker reflected: "I was so irrational…I didn’t want anyone to take him.”</p>

      <p>It comes after her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/liam-payne-says-cheryl-most-20834411">One Direction ex Liam, 26, described Cheryl as the "most important person in his life" and hinted that he'd consider getting back together with he</a>r.</p>
      <p>The pair split last year ahead of their son Bear's first birthday.</p>
      <p>Liam has since made some eye-opening revelations about his feelings towards Cheryl during new documentary, Ant Middleton and Liam Payne: Straight Talking, that saw them travel to Namibia.</p>

      <p>Opening up on the trip, Liam said of his two-year-old son: "Becoming a dad at such a young age, it's such a difficult thing.</p>
      <p>"And I think I built fatherhood up so much in my head that it kind of messed me up to start with. I started in a bad place with it.</p>
      <p>"I think it spooked me out early on, and I was just worried I would not be enough to look after the both of them. They're so important to me — Cheryl as well.</p>
      <p>"She's one of the most, if not the most, important people in my life. I'm lucky I have someone who understands what I'm going through."</p>

      <p>Liam also joked that he and Cheryl could still get back together "if she plays her cards right" but said he'd be in trouble for admitting that.</p>
      <p>Liam is currently dating 19-year-old model Maya Henry.</p>
      <p>He has done a series of interviews praising his new love and said he felt 'very relaxed' and 'happy' with her.</p>
      <p>He told MTV: "I'm really happy right now and things are good. Now that I've found someone who's my best friend as well as my partner. It's massively changed things for me.</p>

      <p>"She's just so relaxed about everything. Someone who's completely got your back with everything is just the wildest thing.</p>
      <p>Recently, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/liam-payne-strips-totally-naked-20806802">Hugo Boss model</a> credited the brunette bombshell for bringing happiness back into his life.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-one shared a loved-up picture of himself and Maya cuddling on the sofa. He captioned the post: "Sometimes I don’t recognise this happy guy... sure glad you brought him back though."</p>
