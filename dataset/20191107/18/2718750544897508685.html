      <h1>Drake Starts Cannabis Company, Despite Being More of a White-Wine Guy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:26:54+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p>Who is ghost-living <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/drake-posts-instagram-story-about-his-father.html">Drake’s life</a>? The rapper has officially collaborated with Toronto’s Canopy Growth Corporation to create More Life Growth Company, a cannabis wellness brand. He announced the new venture by sending <a href="https://www.narcity.com/amp/drake-more-life-flowers-are-mysteriously-appearing-around-toronto">flowers</a> across Toronto this week. Per a <a href="https://www.canopygrowth.com/investors/news-releases/canadian-icons-come-together-canopy-growth-and-drake-launch-new-cannabis-wellness-company/">press release</a> from Canopy, More Life Growth Co. is “a fully licensed producer of cannabis” based in Toronto and “centered around wellness, discovery, and overall personal growth with the hope of facilitating connections and shared experiences across the globe.”</p>
      <p>“The idea of being able to build something special in an industry that is ever growing has been inspiring,” Drake said in the statement. “More Life and More Blessing.” </p>
      <p>So is this his attempt at a side gig like Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty? Because he maybe should’ve left the weed biz to her, too, considering she’s practically never been seen <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/rihanna-instagram-video-vacation.html">without a blunt</a>. Drake, on the other hand, is <a href="https://okmagazine.com/news/drake-reveals-secret-love-white-wine-spritzers-chelsea-handler-thats-my-drink-choice/">known</a> more for being a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/photos-drake-works-on-album-in-toronto-turks-and-caicos.html">white-wine spritzer no matter the season kind of guy</a>. (No shade — white wines matter.) He can do his little thing as long as he doesn’t give Rihanna any ideas and delay her album. Nobody needs Fenty Flower. Actually … wait, that could be something!</p>
