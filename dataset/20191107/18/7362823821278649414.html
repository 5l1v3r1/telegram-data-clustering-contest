      <h1>Whoopi Goldberg says Kamala Harris' school hours plan could be like 'institutionalizing' kids</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/the-view">"The View"</a> co-host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/whoopi-goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a> panned <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/kamala-harris">Sen. Kamala Harris'</a> proposal for school districts to extend school hours, arguing it was wrong to keep kids in school until 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>"I think keeping a kid in school until 6:00 is like institutionalizing them because ... a lot of these buildings do not have gymnasiums. A lot of these buildings do not have a place to have after school programs," she said.</p>
      <p>She was referring to Harris' legislation that would incentivize <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education">school districts</a> to extend school days as a way of accommodating parents' work schedules.</p>
      <p>The program, announced by the Democratic presidential hopeful on Wednesday, would offer five-year, $5 million grants for schools to "develop high-quality, culturally relevant, linguistically accessible, developmentally appropriate academic, athletic or enrichment opportunities for students."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Harris' office indicated to Fox News that the legislation would not mandate that school districts keep students in school during the extended hours.</p>
      <p>"Our bill does not mandate how schools implement the program so long as they stay open until 6 p.m.," press secretary Meaghan Lynch said when asked about the issue.</p>

      <p>"Schools have the flexibility to determine what works best for their community and the students and their families," she said.</p>
      <p>Co-host Joy Behar was in favor of the idea, arguing that kids wasted their time on video games when they went home. "Because you're letting them out early — all they're doing is going home, playing video games, and going on their phones," she said.</p>
