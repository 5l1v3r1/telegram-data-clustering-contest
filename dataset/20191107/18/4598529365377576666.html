      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday narrowly denied the testimony of a top aide of his who resigned partially out of frustration that the State Department wasn’t willing to publicly support a diplomat who President Donald Trump had attacked.</p>
      <p>Michael McKinley had spent decades as a diplomat when Pompeo asked him to be a senior adviser at State Department headquarters, but McKinley resigned after nearly a year in the role, and just a week before testifying in the House’s impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>McKinley <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/highlights-from-newly-released-impeachment-testimony-of-ex-pompeo-aide">testified</a> that he repeatedly pushed the State Department to release a statement in September supporting the ousted ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanitch, who was recalled after a smear campaign against her led by Rudy Giuliani and others.</p>
      <p>Yovanovitch was recalled in May, but a memorandum of President Donald Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was released on Sept. 25 — it revealed that Trump attacked the former ambassador repeatedly during the call. After memorandum was released, McKinley testified, he pushed Pompeo to release a statement supporting Yovanovitch multiple times.</p>
      <p>Asked during a press conference why he never released such a statement, Pompeo instead denied the adviser’s testimony.</p>
      <p>“It’s not surprising that when Ambassador Yovanovitch returned to the United States that he didn’t raise that issue with me,” the Secretary of State said.</p>
      <p>“It shouldn’t surprise anyone that in May when that took place, he didn’t say a thing to me.”</p>

      <p>In fact, McKinley acknowledged during testimony that he didn’t bring up the issue in May.</p>
      <p>“I never spoke about her recall with anyone in the Department,” he said.</p>
      <p>McKinley only involved himself months later, when the memorandum of the call between Trump and Zelensky revealed that both leaders had attacked Yovanovitch during the conversation</p>
      <p>“At this point and over the coming days, I suggested to senior levels of the department that a statement of support for Ambassador Yovanovitch’s professionalism should be released,” he testified.</p>
      <p>McKinley detailed those efforts over several hours of testimony. He brought up the issue with Secretary Pompeo several times, he said, with no response.</p>
      <p>“There was no pushback, no comment. It was just an acknowledgement that I was raising it,” McKinley recalled of Pompeo’s reaction.</p>
      <p>“Nobody ever really said anything to me,” he testified later. The silence from the department, he said separately, was “puzzling and baffling.”</p>
      <p>McKinley said he ultimately heard that Pompeo would not be releasing a statement supporting Yovanovitch from a State Department press official.</p>
      <p>The official told McKinley that Pompeo thought the statement would draw undue attention to Yovanovitch and that it would be better to let the matter die down, McKinley recalled.</p>
      <p>“It would be in part to protect Ambassador Yovanovitch,” McKinley testified, explaining what he was told of Pompeo’s reasoning.</p>
