      <p>Thousands of Guinean protesters took to the streets in the capital Conakry Thursday, in fresh demonstrations days after deadly clashes marred a funeral march for those killed in recent anti-government marches.</p>
      <p>The poor West African country has been shaken by deadly clashes during weeks of protest over suspicions that President Alpha Conde is seeking to prolong his rule.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators on Thursday vowed to march peacefully and demanded the release of government critics imprisoned since the beginning of the anti-government unrest.</p>
      <p>Tensions in the capital are high just days after the deaths of three youths, who the opposition says were shot by the security services as they attended a funeral march for 11 people killed in unrest since mid-October.</p>
      <p>At least 16 civilians and a police officer have been killed during the weeks of bloody clashes with security forces, according to the opposition, with dozens injured and dozens more arrested.</p>
      <p>The National Front for the Defence of the Constitution (FNDC), an alliance of opposition groups that is behind the protests, plans further rallies in other parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Unlike the first demonstrations, these have obtained the green light from authorities.</p>
      <p>Conde has blamed the protesters for the gunfire and accused the opposition of trying to overthrow the government.</p>
      <p>A former opposition figure who was jailed and spent time in exile under Guinea's previous authoritarian regimes, Conde became the country's first democratically elected president in 2010.</p>
      <p>The 81-year-old, whose second term ends next year, launched constitutional consultations in September, saying the former French colony's basic law "concentrates corporate interests" and needed reform.</p>
      <p>But his adversaries say the president will try to push through an amendment allowing him to seek a third term in the nation of 13 million. He has neither confirmed nor denied his intention to seek a third term in elections due in 2020.</p>
