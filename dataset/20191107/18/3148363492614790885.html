      <h1>Fugitive Criminal Alien Arrested After Crossing into Texas from Mexico</h1>
      <h2>Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents arrested a Honduran migrant wanted in Galveston, Texas, for drug possession charges. The man had just illegally crossed from Mexico.</h2>

      <p>Eagle Pass Station Border Patrol agents arrested Orlin Ersides Escobar-Villanueva on November 4 after he illegally crossed the border from Mexico into Texas. All migrants arrested by Border Patrol agents undergo a biometric background investigation during processing. A records check on the 36-year-old Honduran man uncovered an active warrant from Galveston County, Texas.</p>
      <p>At the time of his arrest, Border Patrol officials said the subject was accompanied by his minor children.</p>
      <p>Court records obtained by Breitbart Texas revealed that the court released Escobar-Villanueva on a $5,000 bond in December 2008. In June 2009, the suspect reportedly failed to appear in court and the judge issued a warrant for his arrest. He will now be returned to Galveston County to stand trial on the charge of possession of more than one gram of a controlled substance (cocaine) — a state jail felony.</p>
      <p>Court records also revealed a conviction in Beaumont, Texas, in 2006 for a DWI, Border Patrol officials stated.</p>
      <p>“Border Patrol agents continue to apprehend and interdict illegal aliens who have [an] extensive criminal history,” Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Raul L. Ortiz said in a written statement. “Keeping America safe from criminals is one of our key priorities.”</p>
      <p>Escobar-Villanueva also faces a new federal felony charge of unlawful entry under 8 USC § 1325. If convicted on the charge, he could face up to 10 years in federal prison before being placed into removal proceedings by immigration officers.</p>
      <p>The children will be processed under CBP guidelines, officials reported.</p>
