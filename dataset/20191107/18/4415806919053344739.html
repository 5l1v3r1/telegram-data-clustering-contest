      <h1>Garda whistleblower tells tribunal he smuggled printed Pulse files out of garda station</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:19:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/paul-neilan/" target="_blank">By Paul Neilan</a></address>
      <p>A Garda whistleblower says he smuggled printed Pulse files out of a Garda station in his baton pocket before giving them to politicians, a tribunal has heard.</p>
      <p>Garda Nicholas Keogh is giving evidence at the Disclosures Tribunal, where counsel for An Garda Síochána are cross-examining him.</p>
      <p>The tribunal is in its third week hearing from Gda Keogh, who alleges that a senior member of the Athlone drugs unit, identified to the tribunal as Garda A, was in an improper relationship with a heroin dealer, identified as Ms B, who had a then-estimated €2,500 a week income.</p>
      <p>The tribunal, chaired by Judge Sean Ryan, is investigating if Gda Keogh was targeted, harassed or bullied after he made his protected disclosure on 8 May, 2014.</p>
      <p>Senior Counsel for An Garda Síochána, Mr Shane Murphy, questioned Gda Keogh about an entry in his diary from 30 November, 2015.</p>
      <p>“FF [Assistant Commissioner Fintan Fanning] came into station. Knew who I was, even though I didn't know him and approval of what I'm doing. Printed Pulse on reclassifications. Hid in station. Others smuggled in baton pocket,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Gda Keogh said that he printed off two copies of crimes that had been re-classified downwards that he believed amounted to “fiddling” crime figures.</p>
      <p>“I had to act fast because all Pulse activity is monitored by Garda HQ,” said Gda Keogh.</p>
      <blockquote>So I would print off two copies of the files and hide one in the station and one in the baton pocket.</blockquote>
      <p>Detailed press reports regarding internal investigations and Garda management meetings were later printed in The Irish Independent and RTÉ in October and November 2017 and were shown to the tribunal.</p>
      <p>Mr Murphy said: “You copy and print off documents copied from An Garda Síochána and go to the press and give them to politicians.”</p>
      <p>“I make no apology, we have 2014, 2015, 2016 and now we're into 2017,” said Gda Keogh.</p>

      <p>“All this is calculated to target Superintendent [Patrick] Murray. You were hoping they would be broadcast,” said Mr Murphy.</p>
      <p>Gda Keogh alleges that after he made his protected disclosure of 2014, he was bullied and harassed by his superintendent, Patrick Murray, in Athlone Garda Station.</p>
      <p>“No, I was showing what happened to me. It's not the case that I wanted to 'bring down' Supt Murray," said Gda Keogh.</p>
      <p>Mr Murphy said: “No, it's much more. You were intending to bring down Supt Murray and this is a pattern of action by you to damage Supt Murray.</p>
      <p>“While gardaí [management and HR] were addressing your complaints, you were copying documents and giving them to the media.</p>
      <p>“This is a pattern of your efforts to also put pressure on the authorities to block the promotion of Supt Murray.</p>
      <p>“You were trying to provoke critical conclusion points regarding Supt Murray.”</p>
      <p>Gda Keogh denied the allegation of targeting Supt Murray, and said: “No, there were huge issues. I made my bullying report in 2016, I didn't get to make a statement until March 2017 and here we are in October 2017."</p>
