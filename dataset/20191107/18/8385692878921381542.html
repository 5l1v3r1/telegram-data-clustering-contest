      <p>That was then. Right now you can pick up the Jabra Elite 65t for just $109.99. At this rock-bottom price, it's more of a matter of why aren't you buying them than why you should.</p>

      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>First off, these are true wireless earbuds so not is there no cable connecting them to your smartphone, but also no cable connecting the two sides to each other.</p>
      <p>While this type of design offers the ultimate in freedom and movement, it does have its compromises. One of the most important ones is battery life.</p>
      <p>Compared to the competition, the Jabra Elite 65t fare well in this sense. The battery inside the buds offers up to five hours without needing to be charged.</p>

      <p>When a charge is needed, the carry case also doubles as a charging case, upping the battery life to 15 hours.</p>
      <p>Of course, design and battery life don't matter much if the sound quality is not there. But that's not an issue with the Jabra Elite 65t earbuds. These are great-sounding earphones to begin with and allow you to tweak the sound further through the compatible smartphone app.</p>
      <p>If you want a solid, reliable and good-sounding pair of true wireless earbuds, at this price the Jabra Elite 65t earbuds are very hard to beat.</p>
