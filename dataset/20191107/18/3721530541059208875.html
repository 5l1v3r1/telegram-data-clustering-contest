      <p>The latest high-end duty in <i>Final Fantasy</i><i> 14</i>, The Minstrel’s Ballad: Hades’s Elegy, dropped last week and players have already figured out how to cheese it.</p>
      <p>Once making it to the final phase of the fight, players can pile in on one particular spot of the map, and not move for the rest of the fight — except for the tanks. Standing in this one spot will let you dodge all of Hades’ Dark Current attacks, for some reason. Tanks will still have to leave this spot to stand in Quadrastrike Towers, but they can return to the spot once they’re done. You will still take bleed damage however, so healers should still remember to keep an eye on player health.</p>
      <p>This only helps during the last part of the fight, and getting there is the hard part. But with this trick, you can at least be assured that you’ll be clearing the fight once you hit phase four.</p>
      <p>Check out the video below to see where the spot is on the map and how to pull it off. Note that though it appears the character is in the area-of-effect, they don’t take damage.</p>

      <p>The diagram below shows you where to go, using the patterns you see on the floor.</p>

      <p>We don’t know if this trick is intended, or if it’ll end up getting patched out — but might as well take advantage of it now, just in case.</p>
      <p>To unlock this fight, players have to complete the main scenario quest “Shadowbringers,” and talk to the Minstreling Wanderer in The Crystarium. You need an item level of at least 450 in order to participate in the fight.</p>
