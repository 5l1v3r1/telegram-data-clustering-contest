      <p>Many franchises in Hollywood’s history have had trouble including truly great female characters into their storylines. While the 007 movies have introduced tons of “Bond Women” throughout its almost 60-year history, most of them have basically been leggy model-types brought to screen to rouse and distract James Bond in the series. With the upcoming 25th movie <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484093/no-time-to-die-is-the-most-expensive-bond-movie-ever"><i>No Time To Die</i></a><i>,</i> the moment is finally shifting.</p>
      <p>Along with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483059/after-no-time-to-die-could-moneypenny-get-a-bond-spinoff">Naomie Harris returning to play Moneypenny</a> and Leá Seydoux reprising Madeleine Swann, <i>Captain Marvel</i>’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483952/no-time-to-dies-lashana-lynch-responds-to-backlash-over-female-007">Lashana Lynch is rumored to be inheriting the 007 designation</a> as Daniel Craig’s character retires from spy work. When James Bond is brought back into the action anyway, he’ll also have Ana de Armas (<i>Blade Runner 2049</i>) by his side. Wait… is <i>No Time To Die</i> leaving Bond in the minority gender-wise? Ana de Armas comments on the new “Bond Women” with these words:</p>
      <blockquote>It's pretty obvious that there is an evolution in the fact that Lashana is one of the main characters in the film and wears the pants — literally. I wear the gown. She wears the pants.</blockquote>
      <p>If the 007 label is being passed over to a woman, it doesn’t mean she’ll start dressing impractically! Ana de Armas shared some excitement in the fact that her co-star Lashana Lynch is a key character in <i>No Time To Die</i> who has a dominant role in the happenings of the spy flick and literally wears pants. You know, in case you were wondering. Well, we’ve never seen a female 007, so it’s good to know a little about what to expect!</p>
      <p>The most notable impact to <i>No Time To Die</i> is the fact that <i>Killing Eve</i> and <i>Fleabag</i> writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge has script credit on the movie. She’s not only the first woman to write material for a Bond film since Johanna Harwood’s work on <i>Dr. No</i> and <i>From Russia With Love</i> back in the ‘60s, she’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483752/no-time-to-dies-daniel-craig-drops-f-bomb-defending-phoebe-waller-bridge">Phoebe Waller <i>freaking</i> Bridge</a>. If you too have found yourself suddenly four episodes deep into BBC series <i>Killing Eve</i>, you know how much the stakes are raised with her on board.</p>

      <p>Lashana Lynch and Ana de Armas certainly felt it when told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/how-lashana-lynch-ana-de-armas-are-helping-modernize-james-bond-1252345">THR</a> how hard they fangirled over the writer when they met her for their recent cover interview. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468133/how-lashana-lynch-thinks-maria-would-react-to-her-daughter-becoming-a-superhero"><i>Captain Marvel</i>’s Maria Rambeau</a> felt she had some ownership for her <i>No Time To Die</i>, sharing the creatives were responsive to her adding her own perspective to the British agent. Here’s what Lynch said of her character:</p>
      <blockquote>I didn't want someone who was slick. I wanted someone who was rough around the edges and who has a past and a history and has issues with her weight and maybe questions what's going on with her boyfriend.</blockquote>
      <p>On the flipside, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with wearing a gown in a Bond movie, and Ana de Armas gets to do this in <i>No Time To Die</i>. The actress soon starring in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483715/how-star-wars-the-last-jedi-backlash-helped-rian-johnson-make-knives-out">Rian Johnson’s star-studded <i>Knives Out</i></a> described her character as such:</p>
      <blockquote>[Paloma] is a character that is very irresponsible. She's got this bubbliness of someone who is excited to be on a mission, but she plays with this ambiguity — you don't really know if she's like a really trained, prepared partner for Bond… She's very smart. She helps Bond navigate through certain things that he wouldn't be able to do alone.</blockquote>
      <p>Aside from these dynamic new characters, <i>No Time To Die</i> will additionally be Daniel Craig’s last outing as James Bond as he faces off against Rami Malek’s villain character in the Cary Joji Fukunaga-directed action movie. It comes to theaters on April 8, 2020.</p>
