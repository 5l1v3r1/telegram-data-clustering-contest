      <h1>Apple rolls out iOS 13.2.2 update with fix for annoying multitasking bug</h1>
      <h2>Apps won’t close in the background so quickly anymore</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:32:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/chris-welch" target="_blank">Chris Welch</a></address>
      <p>Apple has just released iOS and iPadOS 13.2.2, with a fix for a frustrating bug that led apps to close in the background much quicker than usual. Even a jump between two apps could be enough for Safari windows to reload or to lose your place in a YouTube video. The issue is also fixed in the iOS 13.3 update that went into beta testing this week, but it’s great to see that Apple is fast-tracking a fix to all customers.</p>
      <p>iOS 13.2.2 also addresses an issue where iPhones could “temporarily lose mobile signal after a call” and another “where mobile data may temporarily not be available.” I’ve randomly lost data — despite my iPhone showing full bars — when coming up from the subway occasionally, so hopefully that bug is now gone thanks to those fixes.</p>
      <p>Apple also notes that this patch “resolves an issue where charging may be interrupted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813129/yubico-first-security-key-for-iphones-works-with-usb-c-google-titan-ios-ipad-pro-1password-lastpass">on YubiKey Lightning-powered accessories”</a> and clears up a bug that caused some replies to S/MIME messages between Exchange accounts to be unreadable.</p>
      <p>The iOS and iPadOS 13.2.2 update should be available now from your settings menu.</p>
