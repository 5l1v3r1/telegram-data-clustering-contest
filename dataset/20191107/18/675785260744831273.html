      <h1>Rape survivor chose to speak to her attacker instead of pressing charges</h1>
      <h2>Marlee Liss, who was a student at Ryerson University, claims she was raped in Toronto, Canada, but has slated authorities and the justice system</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:22:12+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rape">rape</a> survivor told why she chose not to press charges against her attacker - and instead just wanted to talk to him.</p>
      <p>Marlee Liss, 24, claims the rapist subjected her to the degrading ordeal in his home after meeting on a night out.</p>
      <p>She bravely reported it to police but felt she was asked "insensitive" questions, like how much she’d drunk and what she was wearing.</p>
      <p>The student's mental health suffered and she became suicidal one year on from the attack.</p>
      <p>Though police were investigating, Marlee, then just 21, just wanted to confront her attacker.</p>
      <p>"I had never even considered looking into even trying to make it happen," the Ryerson University student said.</p>

      <p>And she learned about Forgiveness Project, a UK-based organisation, which works with both prisoners and victims to heal after trauma.</p>
      <p>It put her in touch with Jeff Carolin, a Toronto lawyer who has worked on a number of sexual assault cases, usually representing the accused.</p>
      <p>They worked together to pursue restorative justice which, as <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/she-was-allegedly-raped-and-couldnt-bear-going-to-trial-so?bftwnews&amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc">Buzzfeed News</a> explains, is used to help those who have done harm and those who have been harmed to meet and hash out a resolution.</p>
      <p>The point is to prevent further harm in the community, have the voices of everyone heard, and provide whatever healing is possible. </p>

      <p>Marlee, of Toronto, said: "Honestly getting the phone call that it was happening was one of the most beautiful, miraculous, emotional experiences of my life.</p>
      <p>"Just the fact that my voice was actually heard within the system, for the first time, and given importance."</p>
      <p>Legal teams reached out to charities and in September, more than three years after the rape, the woman came face-to-face with her attacker.</p>
      <p>Accompanied by her mum, her sister, her lawyer and a charity representative, Marlee asked the man why he raped her.</p>
      <p>"I am so sorry for the harm I caused and I wish I could take it back," he said.</p>
      <p>His words came as a large support to Marlee, who broke down.</p>
      <p>She said: "I didn’t know I needed to hear that she said.</p>

      <p>"When he said that, I just broke down in tears and it just felt like a huge, huge relief.</p>
      <p>"I want to challenge the assumption that all survivors will feel healing by having their assailants incarcerated."</p>
      <p>And, at Marlee's will, the attacker has not been jailed for the offence.</p>
