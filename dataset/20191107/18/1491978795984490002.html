      <p>Antonio Brown, the star wide receiver currently the subject of an NFL investigation into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/23/antonio-brown-nfl-sexual-assault-allegations">alleged sexual assaults</a>, has mounted another social media attack on the league.</p>
      <p>ESPN had reported Brown was due to meet with the league over the allegations next week but on Thursday the 31-year-old lashed out on Twitter. “Imagine conforming to a system giving it a 100 percent to see them treat me like this is unfairly ! Making money off my sweat and blood Fuck the <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL">@nfl</a> I’ll never play in that shit treat black people the worse! Clear my name and go fuck your self,” he wrote.</p>

      <p>Brown is without a team <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/20/bill-belichick-antonio-brown-press-conference">after his release from the New England Patriots in September</a>. The Patriots cut ties with Brown after a woman accused him of sexual misconduct. A different woman, one of his former physical trainers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/10/antonio-brown-rape-lawsuit-florida">accused of him of rape in a lawsuit earlier in September</a>. He played just once for the Patriots following a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/05/antonio-brown-mike-mayock-argument-oakland-raiders-nfl-suspension-reports">tumultuous offseason</a> that culminated with his release from the Oakland Raiders without having played a single game for the team. Brown is not facing criminal charges over the allegations, and several NFL teams are believed to be interested in signing him once the NFL’s investigation is concluded.</p>
      <p>This is the third time in recent months that Brown said he has retired from the NFL. He first announced his retirement after his release from the Patriots, and appeared to reference the money he believes he is owed by the Raiders and Patriots. ESPN reported that both teams rescinded money in his contract when they released him. “Will not be playing in the <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL">@NFL</a> anymore these owners can cancel deals do whatever they want at anytime we will see if the <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLPA">@NFLPA</a> hold them accountable sad they can just void guarantees anytime going on 40m 2 months will see if they pay up!” he wrote at the time. In August, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/09/antonio-brown-helmet-disallowed-oakland-raiders">he threatened to end his career</a> after the league outlawed his favorite helmet.</p>
      <p>Brown has also mounted attacks major figures in the NFL during his time out from the game, including the Patriots owner, Robert Kraft. “Kraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AB84/status/1175764859176312838">he wrote</a>. Kraft was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/22/robert-kraft-arrest-prostitution-new-england-patriots-owner-latest-news">one of hundreds of people charged in February</a> after a prostitution sting at a Florida massage parlor. The 78-year-old businessman has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/28/robert-kraft-prostitution-charges-not-guilty-plea-nfl-new-england-patriots">pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor charges</a> of soliciting sex and requested a jury trial in March.</p>
      <p>Brown recorded 686 catches and 9,145 receiving yards over the past six seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the highest totals for a receiver over a six-year span in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl">NFL</a> history. He caught four passes for 56 yards and a touchdown on Sunday in his only game for the Patriots.</p>
