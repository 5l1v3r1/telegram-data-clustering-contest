      <h1>10,000th Renault Triber delivered</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:39:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:39</time> by <a rel="author">Rivan RS</a></address>
      <p>Triber sales have helped Renault register a month-on-month sales growth of 63 percent.</p>
      <p>The Renault Triber has got off to a strong start. Renault has announced that it has delivered over 10,000 units of its new seven-seater to customers. The big news here is the early success of the Triber has helped the French carmaker post a whopping 63 percent month-on-month sales growth, with 11,516 units sold (wholesale) in October 2019.</p>
      <p>This means that Renault India is now one of the <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/best-performing-car-manufacturers-in-october-2019-414746">best-performing carmakers in terms of sales in October 2019</a></b> – it has overtaken Honda Car India’s sales for the month (10,010 units) but still trails behind Kia (12,850 units) and Toyota (11,866 units).</p>
      <p>The Triber launched in India at the end of August at Rs 4.95-6.49 lakh, though the top-spec variant’s price has been hiked recently by Rs 4,000. For now, the sub-four-metre seven-seater comes with a single powertrain option – a 72hp, 1.0-litre petrol engine that is paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox – though a turbo-petrol engine and an AMT gearbox option are expected to arrive in the near future.</p>
