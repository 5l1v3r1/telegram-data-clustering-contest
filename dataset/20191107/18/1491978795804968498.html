      <p>A former Iranian beauty queen has been stuck at Manila's international airport since 17 October, when Iran issued an Interpol notice for her arrest. Bahareh Zare Bahari says she will be killed if she is sent back home and is seeking asylum in the Philippines, where she has lived for six years. Iran says Bahari is wanted because of an offence committed in 2018, but she claims Tehran is attempting to silence her because of her public stand against the government</p>
