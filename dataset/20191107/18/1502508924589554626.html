      <h1>Airbus extends lead over Boeing with 415 airplane sales in October</h1>
      <h2>The European planemaker also announced on Thursday deals including 12 orders for its A330neo passenger jet from an unidentified buyer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T18:18:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Airbus had 415 airplane orders in October, including its largest ever from a single airline, extending a wide lead over Boeing, which has been hit by the grounding of its 737 MAX.</p>
      <p>The European planemaker also announced on Thursday deals including 12 orders for its A330neo passenger jet from an unidentified buyer.</p>
      <p>The Airbus deals, including a record order for 300 aircraft from India's IndiGo announced last week, brought the January-October total to 718 aircraft or a net 542 after cancellations.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>has reported 170 orders through end-September, the latest period for which data is available, or a net total of 54 after cancellations.</p>
      <p>After an accounting adjustment representing jets ordered in previous years but now thought unlikely to be delivered, Boeing's net total sank to a negative 84 airplanes.</p>
      <p>Airbus, which last week cut its annual delivery target by 2-3% to 860 aircraft, said it had delivered 648 aircraft in the first 10 months of 2019.</p>
