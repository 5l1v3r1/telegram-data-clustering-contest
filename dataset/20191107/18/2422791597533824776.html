      <p>OTTAWA - The Bloc Quebecois has conceded defeat in a Quebec City riding it had hoped to snatch from the Liberals in an official recount.</p>
      <p>Families Minister Jean-Yves Duclos will keep the riding of Quebec after finishing 325 votes ahead of Bloc candidate Christiane Gagnon on Oct. 21.</p>
      <p>Today's concession by the Bloc means the 35 federal seats in Quebec won by the Liberals on election night will remain unchanged.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week the Bloc had also conceded to the Liberals during a recount in the Montreal riding of Hochelaga.</p>
      <p>Liberal Soraya Martinez Ferrada won that riding by 328 votes over Bloc candidate Simon Marchand.</p>
      <p>The Bloc won 32 Quebec seats in the federal election, the Conservatives won 10 and the NDP won one seat.</p>
