      <p>SINGAPORE: A Hong Kong restaurant owner is assisting the Singapore authorities with their investigation over an event in Singapore where people could share their views on the <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/topic/hong-kong-protests">Hong Kong protests</a>, police said on Thursday (Nov 7). </p>
      <p>In a Facebook post, the authorities said they were alerted on Oct 11 to an incident involving Mr Alex Yeung, a Hong Kong resident, "who allegedly organised a gathering for interested persons to share their views on the current protests in Hong Kong". </p>

      <p>"Currently, Yeung’s passport has been impounded while he is assisting the police with ongoing investigations."</p>
      <p>"He is, however, neither arrested nor in police custody, and is free to go about his activities within Singapore," the authorities said. </p>
      <p>The Chinese-ruled city of Hong Kong has been embroiled in anti-government unrest for several months, after what started as rallies against a now-dead extradition Bill erupted into a wider movement calling for greater freedoms and police accountability.</p>

      <p>Mr Yeung said in a YouTube video posted on Monday he had planned to stay in Singapore from Oct 10 to Oct 12 to seek business opportunities.</p>
      <p>"I have never thought of breaking any laws in Singapore … I have never been in politics," said the founder of the Wah Kee chain of restaurants, who has drawn the ire of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong for his pro-China views.</p>
      <p>"The police would like to remind the public that organising or participating in a public assembly without a police permit in Singapore is illegal and constitutes an offences under the Public Order Act," said the Singapore authorities. </p>
      <p>"The police will not grant any permit for assemblies that advocate political causes of other countries. Foreigners visiting or living in Singapore should abide by our laws," they added. </p>
