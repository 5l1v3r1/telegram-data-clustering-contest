      <p>Target may not have the range of electronics deals for Black Friday like a Best Buy, or even competitor Walmart, but it has the clout of its brand and the ubiquity of its locations to sell a lot of the devices it does offer. Below are a half dozen of those specials on laptops, tablets, and smart home hubs that are highlights of Target's Black Friday ad.</p>

      <p>It's been years since the Target Black Friday ad featured iPads on the cover, but it still has a deal on the latest model in this year's edition. The <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-2019/">10.2-inch version</a> of the iPad (non-Pro, non-Mini version) is usually priced at $329, so this is an extremely rare discount of nearly 25 percent.</p>

      <p>This $100 Chromebook appears to be a popular Black Friday special, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-office-depot-and-officemax-black-friday-2019-deals/">Office Depot and OfficeMax</a> are offering the same model for the same price. The 11-v010nr represents Google's original vision for Chrome OS laptops: basic computing via minimal specs (Intel Celeron processor, 4 gigs of RAM, 16GB of built-in storage, 11.6-inch display) at a very low price point.</p>

      <p>You've been able to find this deal everywhere on Black Friday for a few years now -- including on Amazon itself, of course -- but that doesn't mean it's not a good one, letting you snap up a tablet for the price of dinner. If you want something bigger and more powerful, Target is also slashing the price of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-refreshes-the-fire-hd-10-launches-a-kindle-for-kids-and-adds-freetime-to-fire-tv/">the recently refreshed Kindle Fire HD 10</a> by $50 to $99.99 for Black Friday.  </p>

      <p>Target jumps on the gaming laptop bandwagon with a midrange offering from HP that includes an Intel Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB solid-state drive. The 15.6-inch display offers 1,920x1,080 full HD resolution gaming that the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 graphics card can output.</p>
