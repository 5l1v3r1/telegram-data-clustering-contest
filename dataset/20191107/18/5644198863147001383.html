      <p>PRAGUE: World number two and recent WTA Finals semi-finalist Karolina Pliskova said Thursday (Nov 7) she was parting ways with her Spanish coach Conchita Martinez.</p>
      <p>"I decided I will no longer work with Conchita," the 27-year-old Czech wrote on her Facebook page.</p>

      <p>"It was (a) tough decision as the season was great. Thank you for all this year and wish u only the best. Life is a change!!!" added the 2016 US Open finalist.</p>
      <p>Her manager and husband Michal Hrdlicka told the Czech news agency CTK they were in talks with a new coach, without disclosing the name.</p>
      <p>"It has been an incredible year full of great moments and emotions," tweeted Martinez.</p>
      <p>"I wish Kaja and her team the best for the future," added the 47-year-old Wimbledon champion from 1994.</p>
      <p>Pliskova hired Martinez during last year's US Open and she immediately won the Pacific Open in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>She went on to win four WTA tournaments this year and reached the semi-finals at the Australian Open and at last week's WTA Finals where she bowed out to world number one and later champion Ashleigh Barty.</p>
