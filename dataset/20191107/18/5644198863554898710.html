      <p>LONDON: Liverpool forward Sadio Mane says he will not change his style of play despite Pep Guardiola's "diving" accusation.</p>
      <p>The Manchester City boss made the claim at the weekend, when the Senegal international was booked after going down in the penalty area following a challenge by Aston Villa's Frederic Guilbert.</p>

      <p>Manager Jurgen Klopp jumped to his defence and Guardiola subsequently rowed back on the comments, saying they were part of a longer speech in which he praised the forward.</p>
      <p>Mane, unaware of the subsequent climbdown, was unmoved by Guardiola's initial criticism as he believes if there is contact he has a right to go down.</p>
      <p>And he offered a sarcastic response to the City boss ahead of the match between the two sides at Anfield on Sunday, saying: "If it could be a penalty for sure I will 'dive' again.</p>
      <p>"If the 'dive' will give me a penalty then I will do it. Why not? But what Jurgen said is correct. I do not dive," said Mane.</p>
      <p>"There was contact (at Villa) for sure. Maybe it was not a penalty and he didn't give it, and he gave me a yellow card. To be honest I don't have any problem about it.</p>
      <p>"It's what I want to keep doing. If I get a penalty, yeah it's a penalty. If no penalty, no penalty, but (it) will never change the way I'm playing or the way I'm doing my things."</p>
      <p>Guardiola's criticism was seen as the start of mind games leading up to Sunday's Anfield encounter and Mane said the City boss had been a "bit clever" to get the attention of the referee.</p>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions trail Klopp's side by six points but City are the only team to have beaten Liverpool in their past 50 league matches.</p>
      <p>"I can say one of the biggest tests, for sure," said Mane. "But if you ask me I would say not only City because against Aston Villa you can see how the game was and Leicester also was really tough.</p>
      <p>"So I think we played already a few big games in this season and for sure City as well will be a big game."</p>
