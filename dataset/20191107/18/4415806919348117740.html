      <p>Performances of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman have been cancelled for the rest of the week at Piccadilly Theatre after part of its ceiling collapsed.</p>
      <p>About 1,100 people had to be evacuated from the theatre in Denman Street in London’s West End when a section of ceiling crashed down into the auditorium.</p>
      <p>Four people were taken to hospital following the incident on Wednesday night, which occurred during a stage performance of Death of a Salesman, starring US actor Wendell Pierce.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the show said it will still go ahead, with three special performances at the Young Vic theatre in Waterloo.</p>
      <p>All ticket-holders of the cancelled shows will be able to secure a refund or exchange for a future performance.</p>
      <p>Suits star Pierce, who plays protagonist Willy Loman in the show, said in a statement on Thursday “the show must go on”.</p>
      <p>“First, I hope those injured last night in the incident are recovered and healing,” said Pierce, who is also known for playing Bunk Moreland in HBO drama The Wire.</p>
      <p>“Their well-being is the most important thing.</p>
      <p>“I am also so grateful that the Death of a Salesman company is able to continue performances of Arthur Miller’s great play.”</p>

      <p>Pierce said the audience response had been “overwhelming” and thanked the Young Vic theatre for enabling the production to continue.</p>
      <p>He said: “In the time-honoured tradition of the theatre, the show must go on.”</p>
      <p>Performances at the Young Vic will take place on Friday night and will be followed by a matinee and evening performance on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Ticket-holders for the cancelled performances this week will be contacted to make arrangements regarding these performances at the Young Vic,” a spokesman for the Death of a Salesman production said.</p>
      <p>Six people were treated for injuries at the scene following the ceiling collapse, with four being taken to hospital, the London Ambulance Service said.</p>
      <p>Journalist Martin George, 41, who was sitting in the theatre’s grand circle at the time of the incident, said there were screams from the audience as a “chunk” of ceiling fell down.</p>
