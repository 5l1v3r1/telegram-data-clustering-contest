        <b>SEOUL (Sputnik) - The United States has demanded that South Korea pay $4.7 billion to cover the cost of US servicemen stationed there and maintaining armaments in the region, South Korean media reported on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The newspaper<i> Chosun Ilbo</i> has reported, citing State Department senior adviser for security negotiations James DeHart that the US claimed the $4.7 billion only partially covered the defence costs. He also reportedly said US President Donald <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201910181077078360-us-approves-253mln-sale-of-air-launched-missiles-to-south-korea---defence-security-agency/">Trump wanted Seoul to contribute more to the defence</a> provided to it by Washington.</p>
      <p>The newspaper noted there were concerns that Washington might withdraw its forces from South Korea if Seoul did not pay the defence cost.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, South Korea maintains that making such payments would require parliamentary ratification. Moreover, parliamentarians would not be able to monitor defence activities outside the country.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, DeHart and David Stilwell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201909201076845817-seoul-washington-to-hold-talks-on-defence-cost-sharing-deal-in-south-korea-next-week---reports/">visited South Korea</a> to discuss defence cost-sharing.</p>
      <p>After a meeting between Stilwell, Robert Abrams, the commander of the US Forces in the Asian country, and the South Korean president's deputy national security adviser Kim Hyun-chong, the presidential administration said that the South Korean official had "explained our stance [on the pact] and defence cost-sharing, and the US repeatedly stressed that the Korea-US alliance served as the 'linchpin' of security in Northeast Asia", according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Washington has repeatedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910071076977037-us-south-korean-japanese-nuclear-envoys-to-discuss-failed-stockholm-talks/">called on its defence allies across the world to boost their military spending,</a> citing large US contributions.</p>
      <p>There are currently around 25,000 US troops stationed in South Korea, alongside various equipment. The sides have been engaged in talks on cost-sharing.</p>
