      <p>The UK’s competition watchdog has sounded the alarm on 21 routes awarded under the new West Coast Rail franchise.</p>
      <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has concerns on routes between Preston and Scotland after the government awarded the rail franchise to a joint venture between First Group and Trenitalia.</p>
      <p>An initial investigation found that with the two companies running the franchise, “this could lead to higher fares and less availability of cheaper tickets”.</p>
      <p>It added: “Train passengers would have no alternatives, or limited options, to choose from”.</p>
