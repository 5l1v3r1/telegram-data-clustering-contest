        <b>Quube, a company registered in Estonia, will reportedly be the first to develop quantum-resistant blockchain solutions in order to prevent potential quantum computer attacks which, according to the company, are a near-future threat. The news was <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/565446/Quube-Exchange-Worlds-first-quantum-safe-exchange-to-offer-STO-fabric-for-a-better-VC-market-place">published</a> on <i>Acceswire</i> on November 6.</b>

      <h3>Quantum Computers</h3>
      <p>Although blockchain networks are designed to be secure and tamper-proof, there is a growing concern that as quantum computers develop, they could eventually break public-key cryptography and codes that hold the blockchain network together.</p>
      <p><a href="https://btcmanager.com/breaking-bitcoin-quantum-computers-cybersecurity/">Quantum Computers</a> function differently from the classical computers we use today.</p>
      <p>In quantum computing, subatomic particles can exist in more than one form at a time. Due to the behavior of the particles, it’s significantly faster to undergo operations and solve problems and complicated tasks with a quantum computer than classical computers. Having the ability to process these new operations gives quantum computers significant advantages to solve complex tasks such as performing a 51% attack successfully, allowing a single operator to gain control of the blockchain network.</p>
      <h4>Quantum Resistant Blockchain</h4>
      <p>This fear is <a href="https://btcmanager.com/living-post-quantum-cryptography-world/">raising the interest</a> and demand for solutions that preventing similar situations; startup Estone Quube aims to satisfy this market. Through a Quantum Resistant Protocol (QRP), Quube guarantees the development of quantum-resistant blockchain for an upcoming security token offering (STO).</p>
      <p>The startup has created STO Fabric, a launchpad that includes smart fabric for security token structuring, and a KYC service which allows startups to create a company, securitize non-participation stock and tokenize securities. The platform also plays the role of a market to guarantee quick trading for the companies which focus on the acquisition of other firms by using a significant amount of borrowed money to meet the cost of acquisition – also known as a leveraged buyout (LBO).</p>
      <p>The safety of Quube depends on three factors that: critical backup, a data center, and a disaster recovery center, which are protected by first-class encryption and signature.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A real Threat?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlzJyp3Qm7s">According</a> to Bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos, quantum computers are not such a scary threat as the founders of Quube claim. If someone actually had access to such a powerful machine, breaking the security given by public-key cryptography would be the last thing to worry about.</p>
