        <b>DAMASCUS (Sputnik) - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) announced on Wednesday that they had resumed cooperation with the US-led international coalition against the Daesh terrorist group in northeast Syria.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"As a result of a series of meetings with leaders of the coalition, SDF <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911061077237618-withdrawal-huh-at-least-800-us-soldiers-reportedly-to-remain-in-syria-to-secure-its-oil-fields/">resumes working</a> with the coalition to combat IS [Daesh] and protect the infrastructure of northeastern Syria, in accordance with the current stage and the last developments on the ground", Mazloum Abdi, the SDF commander, wrote on Twitter.</blockquote>
      <p>Since 2014, the US-led international coalition has been conducting military operations against the Daesh terror group in Syria, without the government's consent.</p>
      <p>On 9 October, US President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of US troops from northeast Syria after holding telephone talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promptly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911061077236750-turkey-captures-al-baghdadis-wife-sister-brother-in-law-in-syria---erdogan/">launched an offensive</a> against Kurdish militia groups and the Daesh in the region.</p>
      <p>On 17 October, the United States and Turkey agreed to a 120-hour ceasefire in the area to allow the withdrawal of the Kurdish fighters.</p>
      <p>As the five-day ceasefire came to an end, Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin reached a deal that would see the Kurdish fighters pull back from the border area with Turkey.</p>
      <p>In addition, Moscow and Ankara have <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201911051077228893-daesh-militants-flee-syria-to-uncontrolled-mountainous-areas-in-northern-iraq---reports/">begun joint patrols</a> in the operation zone along the Turkish border.</p>
