      <h1>'Our door is always open' - IMO invite Govt talks as they vote to hold industrial action ballot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:25:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Irish Medical Organisation says any industrial action by its members will not take place until next year.</p>
      <p>It comes after they last night voted unanimously in favour of holding a ballot for industrial action, up to and including strike action, next month.</p>
      <p>The union is seeking pay parity for new entrant consultants and says poor working conditions is leading to mass emigration.</p>
      <p>Former IMO President and member of its consultant committee, Dr Matthew Sadlier, says members aren't happy:</p>
      <p>"We are looking to hold the ballot before Christmas but obviously with any ballot it takes a number of weeks to organise," he said.</p>
      <p>"We will consider the responses, more than likely in the early new year and then at that point in time we will see what form the industrial action would take.</p>
      <p>"In the meantime, it the government wants to engage with us on this issue, our door is always open," he added.</p>
