      <h1>Govt may ignore banks' request for help in rescuing DHFL: Report</h1>
      <h2>A consortium - led by Union Bank and State Bank of India - was set up to restructure DHFL's debt a month after it defaulted in June</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:54:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>India's government has no plans to participate in the rescue of Dewan Housing <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/finance">Finance </a>Corporation Ltd, according to two sources involved in talks between bankers and officials over how to restructure the shadow bank's near 1-trillion-rupee ($14.08 billion) debt.</p>
      <p>A consortium - led by Union Bank and State Bank of India - was set up to restructure DHFL's debt a month after it defaulted in June.</p>
      <p>But having struggled to come up with a rescue plan, the banks last week turned to the government for help, the two sources directly involved in the talks told Reuters. But as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhfl">DHFL </a>is a private company with limited links to government, New Delhi is likely to stay clear, said the sources, who requested anonymity as the discussions were private.</p>
      <p>"There is no question of the government issuing directions to the banks (to support DHFL)," one senior government official with direct knowledge of the issue told <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>Litigation and investigations into alleged wrongdoing at the shadow bank could potentially hamper any plan the banks come up with to salvage <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhfl">DHFL.</a></p>
      <p>DHFL's creditors include mutual funds, pension funds, insurance firms and a wide array of retail investors, and its a potential collapse could impact India's already ailing banking sector and further weaken economic growth.</p>
      <p>"If the government of India steps in, it will be a welcome step but our talks suggest that it is unlikely to happen," said the second source, from one of the lead banks in the consortium.</p>
      <p>A government spokesman declined to comment. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/dhfl">DHFL </a>did not respond to a request for comment. Neither Union Bank or SBI were immediately available for a comment.</p>
      <p>DHFL is currently classified as stressed account but will slip into becoming a Non-Performing Assets (NPA) by Dec. 31 unless a resolution is found.</p>
