      <p>A passenger boat carrying at least 60 passengers sunk this morning off the coast of Sibonga town, in Cebu province.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard Station in Southern Cebu received a call for help at about 11:15am from the M/V Siargao Princess, which <a href="https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1830891/Cebu/Local-News/Boat-capsizes-off-Sibonga-town-Cebu">encountered large waves</a> after it departed from Loon town in Bohol, <i>SunStar Cebu </i>reports. Coast Guard spokesman Michael John Encina <a href="https://cnnphilippines.com/regional/2019/11/7/Sibonga-Cebu-MV-Siargao-Princess-rescue.html">told </a><i>CNN Philippines </i>that the “big waves caused the ship to take in water.”</p>
      <p>Encina told AFP in a separate interview that they have yet to come up with a final tally of those rescued, but said all of the people recovered so far were alive. He also said that they couldn’t find the wreckage of the Siargao Princess.</p>
      <p>Those who were rescued have been brought to the Carcar City District Hospital. As of 2pm, search and rescue operations <a href="https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/268816/ferry-capsized-off-sibonga-rescue-on-for-53-passengers-7-crew">were still ongoing</a>, according to <i>Cebu Daily News.</i></p>
      <p>Maritime accidents are common in the Philippines, where people frequently travel from one island in the archipelago to another via old motorboats that are routinely overloaded. Such accidents typically occur <a href="https://coconuts.co/manila/news/11-dead-three-missing-as-boats-capsize-in-philippines/">during the typhoon season</a> in the middle of the year.</p>
