        <b>MEXICO CITY (Sputnik) – Colombian Defence Minister Guillermo Botero has resigned in the wake of a scandal over his failure to disclose deaths that resulted from a security operation against members of a former rebel group.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Today, a decision was made during a meeting with the president of the republic [Ivan Duque] … on the dismissal of the national defense minister", the Defence Ministry wrote on Twitter late on Wednesday.</blockquote>
      <p>The scandal erupted after it was revealed that the operation against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) group, which was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201908291076670919-former-colombian-farc-rebels-call-for-new-offensive-in-video-address/">portrayed as successful</a> by the authorities, led to the death of not only 14 militants but eight minor children believed to have been recruited by force.</p>
      <p>The defence minister was also <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910051076967585-colombias-peace-tribunal-announces-lifting-former-rebel-farc-group-leaders-immunity/">accused of manipulating information</a> and photo evidence for Colombia's dossier for the United Nations on the situation in neighboring Venezuela.</p>
      <p>Botero, 71, was appointed as the defence minister by Duque.</p>
      <p>However, critics have said he has limited security expertise since Botero, a lawyer and a founder of the national business federation FENALCO, has <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201801301061203092-farc-colombia-president-election/">worked as an entrepreneur</a> for most of his life.</p>
