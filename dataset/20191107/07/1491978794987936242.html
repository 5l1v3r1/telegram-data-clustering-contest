      <h1>Facebook urges Australians to report fake ads as it launches tool to target scammers</h1>

      </p>
      <p>Australians are now able to report fake ads they see on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook">Facebook</a> after scammers used unauthorised images of celebrities including Karl Stefanovic, Nicole Kidman and Eddie McGuire.</p>
      <p>The fake Australian celebrity endorsements were used to promote free product trials that were nearly impossible to cancel, or investment schemes.</p>
      <p>“We continue to train our team to better recognise these ads, but feedback from people is critical,” Facebook’s director of product management, Rob Leathern, said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“When users report an ad, that helps us improve our automated detection of some of their changing tactics.”</p>
      <p>Leathern said Facebook was trying to use facial recognition technology to help detect public figures in fake ads, but he said there are challenges in doing so.</p>
      <p>He claimed the company had removed more than 2.2bn fake accounts worldwide and continued to build protection tools to prevent disruptions in the user’s experience.</p>
      <p>The reporting tool lands in Australia after being tested in the UK, where the TV presenter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/23/martin-lewis-drops-lawsuit-as-facebook-backs-scam-ads-scheme">Martin Lewis dropped a lawsuit against Facebook</a> after reaching an agreement that it take action on fake ads.</p>
      <p>Facebook has partnered with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to fight the scams, and is looking to extend the reporting tool to more countries soon.</p>
      <p>“We want to raise awareness and have people’s feedback on any ad that might have escaped our reinforced automated tools to prevent this,” Leathern said.</p>
      <p>“Scams are an ever complicated issue and we’re trying to do everything possible to combat it.”</p>
      <p>According to data from ACCC’s Scamwatch, Australians have lost more than $100m on different types of scams in 2019.</p>
      <p>More than $18m came from scams originating on social networks, with more than 6,000 reports registered.</p>
      <p>Facebook has come under fire recently after it announced it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/04/facebook-exempts-political-ads-ban-making-false-claims">would not fact check political adverts</a> and would not ban ads from political candidates for making false claims.</p>
      <p>A Facebook spokesman said: “We don’t believe that it’s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates. Nor do we think it would be appropriate to prevent a politician’s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.”</p>
