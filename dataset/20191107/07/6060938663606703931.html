      <p>Designer and Salman Khan’s personal celebrity <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ashley-Rebello">Ashley Rebello</a> has been hitting the headlines for his cool work with the lead cast of Prabhudheva’s ‘Dabangg 3’. In an exclusive interview with ETimes, Ashley opened up about working with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a>, the actor’s style and more. Excerpts from the interview:</p>
      <p><b>Tell us something about Salman Khan’s look in ‘Dabangg 3’ as ‘Chulbul Pandey’.<br/></b>The film revolves around his past and it is the story that is before he became an inspector. So you will get to see a new <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Chulbul-Pandey">Chulbul Pandey</a> in terms of his clothes, looks, and hairstyle. You will get to see two Chulbul Pandey at the cost of one.</p>
      <p><b>How has been your experience working with Salman Khan?<br/></b>I have been with Salman Khan for the past 14 years. My first movie ‘Wanted’ was with him. It has been a wonderful journey. I am looking forward to many more years with him. After so many years, if I am still there in the industry and doing Salman’s styling, I must be doing something right. He loves how I dress him up. I have tried to capture his personality with every character that he has played on screen. I try to evolve his style with his age and also with the personality that he is and also the character that he is playing.</p>
      <p><b>How would you describe Salman’s personal style?<br/></b>Salman’s personal style is very simple. He is comfortable in shorts and ganji. He loves that. Otherwise, it is more jeans and t-shirts. On formal occasions, he likes to wear suits. He looks so dapper that he carries them off with a different panache.</p>
      <p>Ashley has styled <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonakshi-Sinha">Sonakshi Sinha</a>, Salman Khan and debutant Saiee Manjrekar in ‘Dabangg 3’. It also stars South superstar <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sudeep">Sudeep</a> in a negative role. It is slated to hit the theatres on December 20, 2019.</p>
