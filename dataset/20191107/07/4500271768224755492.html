      <p>“Pakistan welcomes the conclusion of the landmark Riyadh Agreement, as a result of the initiative taken by the Saudi leadership and support by UAE Government. We believe it is a crucial and important step forward towards a political solution and durable peace and security in Yemen,” PM Khan tweeted.</p>
      <p>The internationally recognised government of Yemen led by President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi signed the power-sharing deal in Riyadh with separatists in the south of the country, who enjoy backing of the UAE, to end the deadly feud in the anti-Houthi bloc. The separatists had taken over control of Aden from the Saudi-backed forces loyal to Hadi in August this year.</p>

      <p>Following the agreement, Hadi’s forces would now return to Aden and the separatists would get positions in the new cabinet. It is believed that the accord would allow the anti-Houthi alliance to refocus on the fight against Houthi militia that has been in control of Sanaa and a large part of northern Yemen since 2014.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Saudi assistant defence minister Mohammed Bin Abdullah Al Ayesh met Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa at the General Headquarters.</p>
      <p>“During the meeting views were exchanged on issues of mutual interest including defence and security cooperation between both countries and overall regional security situation,” the Inter-Services Public Relations said.</p>
