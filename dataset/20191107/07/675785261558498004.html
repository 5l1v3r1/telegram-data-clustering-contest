      <h1>BREAKING: Sainsbury's profits tumble 15% as £41million wiped from bottom line</h1>
      <h2>The supermarket giant blamed the weather among other things as its first half profits came in more than £40 million lower than last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:36:20+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:36</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>Sainsbury's reported a 15% fall in first-half profit, blaming the combined impact of the phasing of cost savings, higher marketing costs and tough weather comparatives with last year that hit sales.</p>
      <p>The profit fall comes as the 150-year old Sainsbury's tries to rebuild confidence in its strategy following a botched attempt to take over rival Asda. Britain's competition regulator blocked the agreed £7.3 billion deal in April and Sainsbury's shares have fallen 34% over the last year.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's it made an underlying pretax profit of £238 million in the 28 weeks to Sept. 21. That compares with analysts' average forecast of £232 million but is down from £279 million made in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>It forecast profits in the second half would benefit from the annualisation of last year's staff wage increase and a normalisation of marketing costs and weather comparatives.</p>

      <p>Chief executive Mike Coupe said the company was investing heavily and customers were seeing the benefits.</p>
      <p>"We have created positive momentum across the business through strategic investments in our customer offer," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have lowered prices on every day food and groceries, launched a range of value brands and are more competitive on price than we have ever been.</p>
      <p>"We are investing in hundreds of Sainsbury's and Argos stores, introducing new products and services and continually improving service and availability. As a result, customer satisfaction has increased significantly year on year."</p>
