      <p>Hey, good morning! You look fabulous.</p>
      <p>Mark your calendars because Tesla's next big unveiling has a date. Other than an electric pickup truck, we're also taking a closer look at Apple's latest wireless earbuds and following the troubled launch of <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i> on PC.</p>

      <p>According to Elon Musk, Tesla has crafted the Cybertruck to "meet or exceed an F-150. If the F-150 can do it, then a Tesla truck should be able to do it." The pickup will supposedly look as if it came out of a sci-fi movie like <i>Blade Runner</i>. And the CEO has revealed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/tesla-electric-pickup-truck-event-elon-musk/">we'll meet Tesla's first electric truck on November 21st</a>.</p>

      <p>We've spent over a week testing Apple's new headphones, and you know what? They're good. The company's AirPods have been the most popular true wireless earbuds for a while now, despite their polarizing design. The AirPods Pro are Apple's best true wireless earbuds to date, but they're also its most expensive. New features like active noise cancellation, transparency mode, on-board controls and silicone ear tips are all upgrades over the previous two models.</p>
      <p>Despite Sony's WF-1000XM3 outperforming these in audio and noise cancellation, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/apple-airpods-pro-review/">the AirPods Pro do a great job with both</a>, and hands-free Siri is a key feature Sony doesn't offer. The AirPods Pro cost $249 and are available now.</p>

        <b>The system had several serious software flaws, the NTSB said.</b>

        <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-accident-ntsb/?utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=morningafter">Uber self-driving car involved in fatal crash couldn't detect jaywalkers</a>
      </p>
      <p>The self-driving car that struck and killed a pedestrian in March 2018 had a major software flaw, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-accident-ntsb/">according to the National Transportation Safety Board</a>. Uber's software failed to recognize the victim and didn't calculate that it could collide with her until 1.2 seconds before impact, when it was too late to brake.</p>
      <p>Uber's system design "did not include a consideration for jaywalking pedestrians," which is also particularly damning. While the NTSB will meet to determine the cause of the accident, prosecutors have already absolved Uber of criminal liability but are still weighing criminal charges against the driver.</p>

      <p>Following a Halloween shooting in California and a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb">report of scammers operating nationwide</a>, Airbnb is attempting to improve the safety of its listings. The company plans to review every listed property, checking basics like addresses and photos, authenticity of the hosts and safety standards.</p>
      <p>To back up the review process, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/06/airbnb-will-verify-every-listing/">Airbnb will also implement a "guest guarantee"</a> if your rental doesn't match the description. You'll either get an alternative worth at least as much as you paid or, if that isn't available, a full refund.</p>
