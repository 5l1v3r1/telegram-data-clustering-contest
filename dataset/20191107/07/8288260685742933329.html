      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Etihad Stadium boss made the comments about Sadio Mane's dive in the 2-1 win at Villa Park on Saturday after his side's defeat of Southampton</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:23:25+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:23</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool star Sadio Mane has hit back a Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola after being accused of diving by the Barcelona legend.</p>
      <p>Guardiola bizarrely rounded on Mane on Saturday evening in his post-match press conference after watching his side come from 1-0 down to beat Southampton 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mane and Liverpool had been in action at the same time, beating <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> by the same scoreline at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>It was a similar situation in B6, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-liverpool-live-robertson-17188264">Mane's side behind before storming back to grab the three points</a> late on.</p>

      <p>The Senegal international crossed in for Andy Robertson's headed equaliser before bundling in Trent Alexander-Arnold's corner four minutes into added time.</p>
      <p>There was controversy surrounding Mane in the clash because he was booked for simulation, leading to Guardiola to accuse him of diving.</p>
      <p>Critics have said Guardiola <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jurgen-klopp-pep-sadio-mane-17198492">was trying to get into Mane and Liverpool's heads in the build-up</a> to the Premier League clash between the two sides on Sunday, with City six points behind Jurgen Klopp's league leaders.</p>
      <p>But Mane says he takes no notice.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“I think it's a bit clever from him to get the attention of the referee but I will just play my football like I'm always doing," he says.</p>
      <p>"I don't pay attention to what he's saying because it's part of football.</p>
      <p>“It doesn't make anything for me.</p>
      <p>"Even though I saw him commenting about it, what he said, for me, I think it's positive!”</p>
