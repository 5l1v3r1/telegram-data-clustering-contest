      <p>On November 7, <b>JYP Entertainment </b>labelmates <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/got7">GOT7</a> and <b>Wonder Girls</b>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/yubin">Yubin</a> appeared as guests on <b>SBS power FM</b>'s '<b>Cultwo Show</b>'!</p>
      <p>On this day, Yubin introduced her solo comeback title track, "<b>Silent Movie</b>". She shared, <i>"I wrote the song comparing a couple on the verge of breaking up, with no more conversations between them, to a silent movie. I don't particularly have a specific source of inspiration, but sometimes when I think of something I work on it right away. <b>J.Y. Park </b>liked it immediately after hearing it once."</i></p>
      <p>After singing "Silent Movie" for listeners live, Yubin received compliments from not only 'Cultwo Show's DJs, but also from GOT7, as <b>JB</b> remarked,<i> "Noona's song is Jjang." </i></p>
      <p>Later, the DJs asked Yubin to name some of her closest celebrity friends. Yubin answered, <i>"That would be Wonder Girls, of course. I am close with our label artists like GOT7, and J.Y. Park." </i>The GOT7 members also coined Yubin as one of their closest celebrity friends, showcasing the friendly bond of JYP artists.</p>
