      <h2>It has been a positive campaign in the Europa League so far for United in terms of results and they can qualify for the next round with victory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:20:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fletcher</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United's Europa League journey continues as they take on Partizan Belgrade.</p>
      <p>Although The Red Devils’ Premier League campaign has been underwhelming, they top Europa League Group L on seven points and a win in this tie confirms their progression to the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Despite having 61 percent possession against Partizan two weeks ago, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men only managed to muster one shot on target in the entire 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>Anthony Martial’s penalty was the difference between the sides last time out, but United fans will be hoping the game is more of a formality on home soil.</p>
      <p>Here’s everything you need to know before the match...</p>
