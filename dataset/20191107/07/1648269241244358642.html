      <h1>See The Lamborghini Huracan Evo's Amazing Acceleration To 180 MPH</h1>
      <h2>There's something special about the sound a naturally aspirated V10 makes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:35:59+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/367780/lexus-lfa-successor-possible/">Lexus LFA</a> with its glorious 4.8-liter 1LR-GUE engine tweaked by Yamaha might just be the best-sounding car to rock a V10 the automotive industry has ever seen, but the Lamborghini Huracan’s 5.2-liter unit also generates a sweet soundtrack. The folks over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK5kVLiFiF0"><i>Motorsport Magazine</i></a> allowed the naturally aspirated powerhouse shared with the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/audi/r8/">Audi R8</a> to sign its tune in an acceleration test.</p>
      <p>With Corsa mode activated and launch control turned on, the Huracan driver slammed hard on the accelerator pedal and ended up perfectly matching Lamborghini’s official 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) time of 2.9 seconds. It was a different story for the 0 to 124 mph (200 km/h) run as the Sant’Agata Bolognese’s idea of an Evo needed 9.3 seconds to complete the task, which is three tenths of a second more than what the specs sheets says. Still, the “baby Lambo” furiously accelerates like there’s no tomorrow, even without the aid of forced induction.</p>

      <p>It eventually got up to 180 mph (290 km/h), but the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/lamborghini/huracan-evo/">Huracan Evo</a> can reach a significantly higher top speed as Lamborghini say it will do more than 202 mph (352 km/h) provided that the road is long enough for the V10 to stretch its legs.</p>
      <p>One has to wonder what another <a href="https://www.motor1.com/features/369315/lamborghini-sesto-elemento-supercar-sunday/">Sesto Elemento</a> would bring in terms of extra performance taking into account the Gallardo-based supercar reserved to the track weighed only 999 kilograms (2,202 pounds). The Huracan Evo is considerably heavier, at 1,422 kg (3,134 lbs), and that’s before adding fluids.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.motor1.com/lamborghini/">Lamborghini</a> has launched its fair share of Gallardo and Huracan derivatives over the years, but the Sesto Elemento remains our favorite and we’d be interested in seeing a new to remove some of the Huracan’s fat. There’s no word about that happening, but knowing the Italian brand’s affinity for special versions, it’s not completely out of the question.</p>
