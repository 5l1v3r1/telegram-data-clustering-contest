      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is ready to give youth a chance in Manchester United's Europa League clash with Partizan Belgrade.</p>
      <p>United are sitting pretty at the top of Group L after three matches, winning two of those and drawing once.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer's side are yet to concede a goal in Europe and can all but qualify for the knockout stages with victory at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>After a 1-0 win in Belgrade a fortnight ago, Solskjaer is prepared to rotate his squad again for the encounter.</p>
      <p>Youngsters James Garner and Brandon Williams are expected to come into the starting line-up.</p>

      <p>United could also hand a start to Mason Greenwood, who has found his opportunities limited since returning from injury.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer is also expected to give the likes of Sergio Romero, Marcos Rojo and Jesse Lingard some much-needed minutes.</p>
      <p>United are back in action against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> on Sunday, with the Red Devils expected to rest Marcus Rashford, David de Gea and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, among others.</p>

      <p>Paul Pogba, Victor Lindelof, Nemanja Matic, Axel Tuanzebe, Eric Bailly and Angel Gomes are all set to miss out.</p>
      <p>Luke Shaw, meanwhile, trained separately from the group this week and also looks set to miss out.</p>
      <p>On Pogba's return, Solskjaer said: ""He (Pogba) said it himself.</p>
      <p>"It won’t be too long until he’s out of his cast. He’ll work hard during the international break and hopefully, he’ll be back."</p>
