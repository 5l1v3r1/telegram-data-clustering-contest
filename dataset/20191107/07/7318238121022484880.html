      <h1>Erdogan and Trump reconfirm meeting next week after phonecall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T07:08:05+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 07:08</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump have reconfirmed their meeting in Washington later this month after speaking to each other over the phone.</p>
      <p>The pair will meet on November 13 in the US capital at Trump's invitation, Turkish officials have said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, three Turkish officials had said Erdogan might call off the visit in protest of votes in the U.S. House of Representatives to recognise mass killings of Armenians a century ago as genocide and to seek sanctions on Turkey.</p>
      <p>However, officials on Wednesday said the visit would go ahead and that the two leaders had exchanged views on bilateral issues and regional developments during their phone call.</p>
      <p>Turkish sources say Trump and Erdogan have a strong bond despite anger in Congress over Turkey's Syria offensive and its purchase of Russian air defences, and despite what Ankara sees as the US president's own erratic pronouncements.</p>
      <p>Those personal ties could prove crucial, given NATO member Turkey's purchase of Moscow's S-400 missile defence system, which under US law should trigger sanctions.</p>
      <p>Turkey has already been suspended from the F-35 fighter jet programme in which it was both joint producer and customer, and the offensive it launched against Kurdish forces in northeast Syria on October 9 set the stage for further US retaliation.</p>
