      <p>"The question that everyone should ask the BJP government is that who is being benefitted during their tenure. The Prime Minister went to the United States and held his 'Howdy Mody' event but America increased the number of rejections of H-1B visas for those Indians wanting to work there," she said in another tweet.</p>
