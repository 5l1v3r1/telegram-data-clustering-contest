      <p>There’s nothing like a good stretch in the morning to kick-start the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">weekend</a>, especially if it’s a free-to-attend yoga class to knock out your 30 minutes of fitness a day.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/420979-there-are-now-exclusively-cheaper-taxis-to-dubais-global-village">Global Village</a> is setting up a huge Yoga Day Out as part of the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/418947-dubai-fitness-challenge-2019-every-event-confirmed-so-far">Dubai Fitness Challenge 2019</a>, hosted by professional yogis and ambassadors from sports brand lululemon. Prepare that activewear.<br/><br/>Setting up two 60-minute classes from 7am until noon on Friday November 8, yogis around Dubai won’t need to worry about space, as the entertainment destination is ready to welcome up to 3,100 participants. There’s a lot of stretching to be done.<br/><br/>The first class at 8am hosted by yogis Allie McLaughlin and Neha Duseja will be a vinyasa-style class that’s all about building strength in the body. The duo will be trying out new poses for everyone to learn but be wary, the class is designed to make you work up a sweat.<br/><br/>After an hour break, the second class at 10am will see Neha and Allie return for a more chilled yoga session, working on getting deeper into your stretches by holding poses for longer periods of time.<br/><br/>The class will finish off with relaxed breathing techniques and a meditation to keep your mind fresh.<br/><br/>For the rest of the time, yogis are free to do their own stretching around Global Village’s open garden.<br/><br/>Fancy a few cobra poses in the morning?
