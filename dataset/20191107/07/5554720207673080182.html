      <p>Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the increase in the rejection of H1-B Visas for Indians in the US. This was after a US think-tank said that Donald Trump’s restrictive policies on immigration have led to the denials of applications for H1-B Visas by Indians.</p>

      <p>Taking to Twitter, Priyanka wrote in Hindi, “Everyone should ask the BJP government as to who’s being helped under its regime. Prime Minister travelled to America for his own ‘Howdy, Modi’ but America increased the number of rejections the H1-B Visas for Indians, willing to work there.”</p>

      <p>PM Modi had travelled to the US to attend his much-publicised ‘Howdy, Modi’ event in September this year. The event was billed as Modi’s success to build a new friendly relationship with the US administration headed by President Donald Trump. Modi’s ‘Abki Baar Trump Sarkar’ at the ‘Howdy, Modi’ event in the presence of the US President had triggered a huge controversy.</p>
      <p>A report by news agency PTI said that the denial rate of H-1B petitions for initial employment for Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and Google in 2015 was just 1%. In 2019, the same increased respectively to 6, 8, 7 and 3%. The denial rate for Apple remained the same at 2%.</p>
      <p>During the same period, the denial rate jumped from 4% to 41% for Tech Mahindra, from 6% to 34% for Tata Consultancy Services, from 7% to 53% for Wipro and from just 2% to 45% for Infosys.</p>
