      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>All public and private schools have been closed in Lahore today due to high levels of smog.</p>
      <p>The Punjab government took the late-night decision after a sudden spike in Lahore’s Air Quality Index (AQI) from less than 200 to more than 500.</p>
      <p>“All Schools of Lahore (public and private) to remain closed tomorrow [on] November 7, 2019,” said Provincial Minister for School Education Dr Murad Raas in a tweet.</p>

      <p>He added, “Smog [is] at abnormally high levels right now in Lahore. [The government is] continuously monitoring the situation. Please refrain from taking the kids outdoors unless it is absolutely necessary. Will update.”</p>
      <p>Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar also directed the concerned staff to enhance efforts to control crop burning besides undertaking other steps to curb smog in the city.</p>

      <p>Buzdar told authorities to run an effective awareness campaign related to smog.</p>
      <p>“The agriculture department should strictly ensure the implementation of a ban on burning crop remains. As per law, action should be taken against the industries responsible for spreading pollution,” he stressed.</p>
      <p>The provincial CM ordered to strictly ensure the enforcement of a ban on burning tyres.</p>

      <p>Federal Minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, in a tweet, took a jibe at the Indian government saying that crop burning in Jallender is playing havoc with the environment on both sides of the Punjab border.</p>
      <p>He further offered to help the Indian government by suggesting them to use a “machine solution to turn crop waste into a burning billet”.</p>
