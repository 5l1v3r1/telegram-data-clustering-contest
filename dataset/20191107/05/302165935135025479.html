      <p>PETALING JAYA, Nov 7 — If at first you don’t succeed, try and try again.</p>
      <p>That was certainly the motto of Shah Azham, who never allowed himself to be discouraged despite performing poorly in school.</p>
      <p>The hardworking youth set up a design company after failing the Sijil Pelajaran Malaysian (SPM) exam and decided to teach himself Korean to secure new opportunities.</p>
      <p>“When I was in school, I played around a lot and I didn’t focus on my studies. I preferred to spend my time learning Photoshop, music, languages, and sports.</p>
      <p>“After SPM, I decided to do things I like instead of the things that I have to, so I started my own design company.</p>
      <p>“At the same time I noticed that Korean music, dramas, and shows were booming in Malaysia,” he shared on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Shah explained that he didn’t have money to splurge on Korean lessons earning as low as RM24 a month, so he took it upon himself to look up learning materials online.</p>
      <p>During that time, he managed to collaborate with a Korean non-governmental organisation and realised how useful knowing a foreign language was when establishing contacts overseas.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old event met the former Korean ambassador to Malaysia to discuss the importance of language and culture exchange between the two countries.</p>
      <p>Six months into learning a new language, Shah decided to risk it all and withdrew the last RM700 of his savings to move to Seoul by himself.</p>
      <p>“I stayed in the cheapest 16-person dormitory and ate bread for every meal.</p>
      <p>“I made many Korean friends and we would help each other out by learning each other’s languages and culture.</p>
      <p>“My Korean language skills improved tremendously because over there, they don’t use English at all.”</p>

      <p>Shah’s knowledge served him well when a Malaysian broadcasting company enlisted his help to film a variety show in Korea as they needed a translator well-versed in Malay, English, and Korean.</p>
      <p>He got his big break when a Korean friend in Malaysia informed him of an opportunity to be a translator for K-pop concerts in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Shah then worked his first gig as an interpreter for the boyband iKON where he acted as a middle man between the Korean and Malaysian production teams, describing it as the “one of the scariest, challenging yet (most) memorable jobs” he had ever taken on.</p>
      <p>Since then, Shah has worked as a translator for groups like Winner and Blackpink and travels back and forth between home and Korea to work on K-pop events.</p>
      <p>“Working with a Korean team is very demanding in the sense of timing, accuracy, and efficiency. If you translate one word wrong, you’re done for.</p>
      <p>“So far, the best concert for me has been Blackpink’s. The production was out-of-this-world.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have to mention the stress. Every hour I felt like my head was going to explode, but it was definitely worth it.”</p>
      <p>His Twitter thread has gotten more than 8,000 retweets and 10,000 likes so far and Malaysians have been feeling inspired by his ambitious nature and hard work.</p>
      <p>“Your story has motivated me to keep striving for success and not dwell on the failures of the past,” wrote @ZafranZainol.</p>
      <p>“You went from zero to hero! You should be proud of your success because your hard work and determination brought you to where you are today!” said @xyvenphantom.</p>
