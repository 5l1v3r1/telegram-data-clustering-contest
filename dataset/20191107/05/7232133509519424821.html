      <h3>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Recently, there was a decent rise in BCH price above the $285 resistance area against the US Dollar. The BCH/USD pair is now trading close to the main $300 resistance area, where the bears are putting up a fight. If there is an upside break, the price could continue to rise towards $320.</p>
      <p>Conversely, there could be a downside correction below the $295 level. An immediate support is near the $285 level, followed by the key $280 support area.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin SV, Binance Coin (BNB) and ADA Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past few days, there was a decent rise in bitcoin SV above the $125 and $130 resistance levels. BSV price even broke the $135 resistance and it is currently consolidating below the $140 resistance. If there is an upside break above $140, the price could test the $150 level.</p>
      <p>Binance coin (BNB) mostly traded in a range above the $20.00 and $20.20 support levels. BNB price is currently facing a lot of hurdles near the $21.00 and $21.20 levels, above which it could rise towards the $22.00 zone. On the downside, the main supports are near the $20.00 and $20.20 levels.</p>
      <p>Cardano price surged towards the $0.0465 resistance area, where it failed. ADA price is currently correcting lower and is trading below the $0.0450 level. If there are more downsides, the next support is near the $0.0425 level. On the upside, the $0.0450 and $0.0465 levels are important resistances.</p>

      <p>Looking at the total cryptocurrency market cap 4-hours <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/CRYPTOCAP-TOTAL/">chart</a>, there are a few bearish signs emerging below the $248.0B and $250.0B resistance levels. It seems like the market cap is losing momentum and it recently broke a bullish trend line near the $244.B support. Therefore, there are chances of a bearish wave in bitcoin, Ethereum, ADA, ripple, tron, XLM, ADA, BNB, ICX, BCH, EOS, and other altcoins in the coming sessions.</p>
      <p>Conversely, there are many hurdles for the bulls near the $248.0B and $250.0B levels. A clear break above $250.0B is needed for more gains.</p>
