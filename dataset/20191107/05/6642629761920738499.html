      <p>Images posted on social media showed the driver's side window of Generoso's vehicle peppered with several bullet holes.</p>
      <p>If the killing is work-related, Generoso would be the 14th journalist to be killed since President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/rodrigo-duterte.html">Rodrigo Duterte</a> came to office in 2016, and the 187th since 1986.</p>
      <p>Salvador Panelo, Duterte's spokesman, said in a news conference that the president has directed authorities to investigate the incident and prosecute the people behind the deadly attack.</p>
      <p>In a statement posted on social media, the College Editors Guild of the Philippines condemned the killing and demanded justice for Generoso.</p>
      <p>Generoso, 67, was the second radio reporter killed in the city in 18 months.</p>
      <p>In May 2018, Edmund Sestoso was also killed by unidentified motorcycle-riding gunmen.</p>
      <p>On October 30, another radio broadcaster from the southern island of Mindanao survived an assassination attempt after being shot five times.</p>
      <p>The Philippines is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, according to Human Rights Watch.</p>
      <p>According to a recent report by the <a href="https://cpj.org/reports/2019/10/getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>, the Philippines has the most unsolved journalist murder cases in the world.</p>
