      <p>SAO PAULO: Lawmakers in Brazil have watered down pro-gun President Jair Bolsonaro's proposal that would have allowed ordinary people to carry weapons in public.</p>
      <p>The lower house of Congress voted late Tuesday in favour of giving hunters, sports shooters and collectors easier access to weapons.</p>

      <p>But they opposed easing restrictions that would have allowed millions of ordinary Brazilians to buy and carry guns on the street.</p>
      <p>The new version of the bill has to be approved by the Senate before it becomes law.</p>
      <p>Bolsonaro, a former army captain, caused a stir in May when he issued a decree enabling a wide range of professions, including truckers, politicians and even some journalists, to carry weapons without having to prove why they needed them.</p>
      <p>Weeks later, he revised the original order to restrict "common citizens" to carrying handguns but not rifles in public.</p>
      <p>Following legal and political challenges to the decree, Bolsonaro revoked his order and sent a bill to Congress to change legislation on the registration, possession and commercialization of weapons.</p>
      <p>Experts have warned the loosening of restrictions would fuel gun violence in a country which already has one of the highest homicide rates in the world.</p>
