      <p>The Met Office has issued an amber 'danger to life' flood alert, warning that up to 100mm of rain may fall in eight hours.</p>
      <p>The mammoth downpour means certain parts of north and north-west England could see nearly a month's worth of rain today and tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The amber <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warning covers an area stretching from Manchester to Sheffield and will be in force between 7am today and 3am tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Another alert, set to last from 6am today to the same time tomorrow, has been issued for the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>A yellow rain warning is also in place for north Wales and English border towns today, with forecasters expecting the worst of the weather between 9am and midnight.</p>

      <p>Fast flowing floodwater is likely, posing a danger to life, the Met Office warns.</p>
      <p>It also says there is a 'good chance' of communities being cut off by floodwater.</p>
      <p>The other two warnings also raise the prospect of Brits being left stranded at home by the flooding.</p>
