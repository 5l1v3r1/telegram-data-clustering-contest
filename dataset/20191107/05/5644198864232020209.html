      <p>But investors remain uneasy over the lack of tangible headway after the two sides announced a preliminary verbal agreement on trade last month and Washington held off on tariff increases.</p>
      <p>Wednesday reports that the United States and China might delay a meeting to formalize the agreement rankled investors.</p>
      <p>"Given that 80 per cent of the rally since September is based on the improvement in trade, it is natural that investors would be a little nervous each time the meeting gets pushed back," said Gregori Volokhine of Meeschaert Financial Services.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished essentially flat at 27,492.56.</p>
