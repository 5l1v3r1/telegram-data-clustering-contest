      <h1>Avengers: Endgame is officially a launch title on Disney+</h1>
      <h2>Bringing the total number of Marvel movies at launch to seven</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T05:31:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 05:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/julia-alexander" target="_blank">Julia Alexander</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18513309/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review-marvel-cinematic-universe-iron-man-thor-captain-america-phase-4"><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a><i> </i>will land on Disney+ one month earlier than expected, moving from December 11th to November 12th in the United States. The date change makes <i>Endgame </i>a launch title.</p>
      <p>During a call with investors in May, Disney CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537390/avengers-endgame-disney-plus-stream-exclusively-december-11-release-date">announced that <i>Endgame </i>would be available on Disney+</a> on December 11th. Iger noted that <i>Endgame</i>’s placement would come “just a month after we launch the service.” That date was later reiterated by Marvel Studios head honcho Kevin Feige at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/24/20830541/d23-disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-pixar-mandalorian-ms-marvel-she-hulk-obi-wan-high-school-musical">D23, Disney’s biennial fan convention</a>, in August.</p>
      <p>An announcement tweet from the official Disney+ account didn’t indicate why the change was made. It’s become increasingly clear that having splashy titles available at launch is important for Disney when it comes to bringing in subscribers. Disney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20941540/disney-plus-starz-ads-star-wars-force-awakens-espn-streaming-wars-licensing">worked out a deal with Starz</a> that includes showing a one-time promotional ad for the premiere network (which customers will see once they finish signing up for Disney+) in order for certain films, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/16/10243884/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review"><i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i></a><i>, </i>to appear on Disney+ at launch.</p>
      <aside>That means only... most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is unavailable</aside>
      <p>That’s also why certain Marvel titles, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16501108/thor-ragnarok-movie-review-marvel-chris-hemsworth-taika-waititi"><i>Thor: Ragnarok</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-panther"><i>Black Panther,</i></a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17276030/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel-iron-man"><i> </i>and <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i></a> aren’t available at launch. Disney’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/8/16115254/disney-launching-streaming-service-ending-netflix-deal">prior deal with Netflix</a>, which includes movies released between January 2016 and December 2018, means those films will remain on Netflix until the end of 2019. That’s why <i>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</i> isn’t there, either. They’ll start to roll out onto Disney+ beginning in 2020.</p>
      <p>Don’t fret, though: there are a few other Marvel movies to watch in the meantime. <i>Iron Man, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Ant-Man, </i>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251874/captain-marvel-review-marvel-mcu-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson"><i>Captain Marvel</i></a><i> </i>will all be on Disney+ at launch. That means only... most of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is unavailable. Eventually, almost all of the MCU movies will end up on Disney+. (There’s no word yet on whether <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20830391/d23-disney-plus-streaming-service-marvel-mcu-exclusives-spider-man-sony-dispute-star-wars">Disney will get the streaming rights</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892494/spider-man-homecoming-review-tom-holland-michael-keaton-robert-downey-jr"><i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761022/spider-man-far-from-home-review-tom-holland-jake-gyllenhaal-mysterio-mcu"><i>Spider-Man: Far From Home</i></a><i>.</i>) It’s just going to take some time.</p>
      <p>The full Disney+ launch lineup, which includes <i>Avatar</i>, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913417/disney-plus-launch-lineup-marvel-star-wars-pixar-tv-shows-movies-simpsons-national-geographic">now available</a>.</p>
