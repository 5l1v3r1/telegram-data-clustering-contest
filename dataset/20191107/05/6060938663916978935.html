      <p>NEW DELHI: Remember <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ritu-phogat">Ritu Phogat</a>, the young, dynamic and diminutive wrestler from the Phogat household in Balali, Haryana? When she won silver at the U-23 World Wrestling Championships in 2017, Ritu was earmarked by many for bigger achievements. She was seen as one of the hopefuls to win a medal at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>But earlier this year, Ritu shocked everyone by announcing her decision to quit wrestling and switch to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mixed-martial-arts">mixed martial arts</a> (MMA). She joined a Singapore-based MMA organization and started preparing for her debut, which is going to take place on November 16 in Beijing. Her opponent will be <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/South-Korea">South Korea</a>'s Nam Hee Kim. For the Korean, it'll be her second match, having enjoyed a victorious debut.</p>
      <p>Ritu is currently concentrating on improving her strength, agility and speed. She trains twice a day on different martial art forms like <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Brazilian-Jiu-Jitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Muay-Thai">Muay Thai</a>, besides honing her skills in wrestling and boxing.</p>
      <p>"I want to win the world championship belt for India. This has never been done before and I want to be the first to win that for my country. Hopefully in the next two years, I can achieve my goal. I am working really hard for that," she told TOI during a conversation from Singapore.</p>
      <p>So why did she leave wrestling and pick up MMA, especially when she was on her way to be one of the superstars in women's wrestling?</p>
      <p>"I have been following MMA since 2012. I used to watch on YouTube and wondered why India doesn't have a world champion in this sport. Even though I was doing well on the wrestling mat, somewhere at the back of my mind I wanted to do something different, something different from what my sisters were doing. I found my calling in MMA at the start of this year," she said.</p>
