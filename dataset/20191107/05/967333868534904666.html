        <b>The Shark, the world's fastest ultra-light aircraft from Czech, which is scheduled to begin production in China next year, is expected to be a star at the 2nd China International Import Expo (CIIE) which runs from Tuesday to Sunday in Shanghai.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The deal to transfer production technology was signed by Czech and Chinese companies this year, and is currently in the development stage which <a href="https://sputniknews.com/military/201908221076605159-chinas-homegrown-aircraft-carrier-to-join-service-by-end-of-year---report/">includes training Chinese employees</a>, the Shanghai-based news website thepaper.cn reported on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The production line in China will be launched in 2020, the report said.</p>
      <p>With a speed of 300 kilometers an hour, the Shark is <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201908191076587846-aircraft-experts-stumped-by-new-variant-of-chinas-jh-7a-fighter-bomber-photo/">said to be the world's fastest ultra-light aircraft</a> and has a range of 1,660 kilometers, the Beijing Daily reported in November 2018, when the aircraft was on display at the Airshow China 2018 in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province.</p>
      <p>As a tandem seat, light <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201908081076499836-us-aircraft-carrier-arrives-in-philippines-amid-spiralling-tension-tsith-china/">plane made of advanced composite material</a> featuring carbon fiber epoxy, the Shark is suitable for multiple purposes including flight training, sightseeing and as a private aircraft, according to exhibitors at the Czech booth at CIIE.</p>
      <p>In 2017, the Civil Aviation Administration of China issued a Validation Type Certificate for the Shark, clearing a path for its production in China, thepaper.cn reported.</p>
      <p>The Shark targets high-end consumers, and is priced between 160,000 to 200,000 euro ($178,000-223,000) for sale around the world, the Beijing Daily said.</p>
