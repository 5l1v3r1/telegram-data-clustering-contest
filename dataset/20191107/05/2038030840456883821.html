      <p>Cape Town - Angelina Jolie admitted that early in her career she failed to secure a part she auditioned for because of her fashion choices, as the shiny PVC material had "fused together" during her wait to be called to audition.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her sense of style growing up, she said: "At school I wasn't that popular person. I was a punk. I loved leather, PVC, and fishnets. Those were my three favourite fabrics in my early 20s. I remember the first time I wore PVC pants. I was waiting for an audition, sitting in the sun in LA. By the time it was my turn, my pants had fused together. I didn't get the part."</p>
      <p>But the experience didn't impact Angelina's love for PVC, as she also recalled wearing a similar outfit when she married her first husband Jonny Lee Miller.</p>
