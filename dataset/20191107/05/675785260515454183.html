      <h2>Victoria Beckham has launched her new Christmas gift guide but it is not for those on a budget with the fashion designer recommending ideas under £500</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T05:17:43+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 05:17</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Victoria Beckham has launched her Christmas gift guide but it is not for her fans that are working to a festive budget.</p>
      <p>The 45-year-old former Spice Girl turned fashion designer has recommended presents for loved ones that come in under £500.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for many of her fans, the cheapest item on the list is one of her branded t-shirts which is priced at a rather steep £95.</p>
      <p>There is no expense spared in Victoria's mind as she looks to offer her subscription clients the best she has on offer from her collections.</p>
      <p>It is also an indication that she is trying to create a niche following who would be happy to part with £165 for mini keyring that had been designed by her.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere on the list, which Posh has titled "Polished presents: little luxuries under £500," there is a lighter that is priced at an eye-watering £220.</p>
      <p>The cheapest items are three branded T-shirts from her collection, of which one is emblazoned with "I can't concentrate in flats".</p>
      <p>These are still priced at £95, so will burn a significant hole in your wallet.</p>

      <p>Victoria's guide also includes "trinket-like jewellery, sophisticated separates and elegant evening wear to get you ready for the holiday season."</p>
      <p>There is also a few items for those feeling a little more frivolous during the festive season, with a lambskin drawstring bag weighing in at £795 and a pair of sunglasses that will set you back £315.</p>
      <p>Victoria has been on a commercial push recently as she looks to make her brand one of the must-haves this Christmas.</p>

      <p>After Adele lost three stone, Victoria sent her a bundle of designer clothes in the hope that the 31-year-old singer would wear her outfits.</p>
      <p>A source told The Sun: “Victoria is a huge fan of Adele and has always longed to see her in one of her designs.</p>
      <p>"While Adele’s never addressed her own dress size, it would have been mortifying to send clothes that didn’t fit, so Victoria shied away from sending anything.</p>
      <p>“Now Adele has shown off her trim new look and is rocking figure-hugging dresses, Posh is keen to get her dressed in one of her designs.</p>
      <p>“To see Adele in one of her outfits would be a dream come true.”</p>
