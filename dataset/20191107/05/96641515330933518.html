      <h1>BBC and ITV's BritBox streaming service launches in the UK</h1>
      <h2>The catalogue of shows is sadly lacking, however.</h2>

      <p>With the popularity of British TV shows in the US, the launch of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/07/bbc-itv-britbox-streaming-service-launch/?guccounter=2">BritBox streaming service</a> in 2017 was an attempt by UK broadcasters to cash in on the streaming wave. ITV, the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5 banded together to offer content through a single BritBox subscription, though it was originally only available on the other side of the pond. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/19/bbc-itv-britbox-launch-uk/">Earlier this year</a>, it was confirmed that the service was finally coming to the UK, and now it's arrived.</p>
      <p>The catalogue of content available through the UK version of the service is different from that available in the US, though both suffer from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/07/bbc-itv-britbox-streaming-service-launch/?guccounter=2">dearth of the most popular shows</a>. Shows available through the UK service include standard fare like <i>Downton Abbey</i>, <i>Gavin &amp; Stacey</i> and <i>Broadchurch</i>, although notably absent are well-known shows like <i>Planet Earth</i>, <i>The Great British Bake-Off</i> or the modern series of <i>Doctor Who</i>.</p>
      <p>In the future more shows and movies will be added, with content from Channel 4 and Film4's back catalogue coming next year as well as original shows from Comedy Central UK.</p>
      <p>For £5.99 ($8) per month, the service supports high definition playback and multi-screen viewing with no contracts and no ads. With the affordable price, BritBox is aiming to undercut services like Netflix which costs £8.99 ($12) per month in the UK for HD on two screens. The lack of top modern shows and the popularity of the BBC's free on-demand service, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/10/bbc-iplayer-guide/">BBC iPlayer</a>, may hamper these ambitions though.</p>
      <p>To try out the service, you can sign up for a 30-day free trial on the <a href="https://www.britbox.co.uk/">BritBox website</a>.</p>
