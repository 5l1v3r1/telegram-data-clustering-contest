      <h1>Michael Jackson moonwalk socks up for auction</h1>
      <h2>Socks could fetch $2 million</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T05:50:30+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 05:50</time> by <a rel="author">Leah Asmelash, CNN</a></address>
      <p>FRANKLIN LAKES, N.J. - Almost 40 years after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/entertainment/michael-jackson-death-anniversary/index.html">Michael Jackson</a> performed his iconic moonwalk for the first time on stage, one fan could get to relive the experience.</p>
      <p>The custom-made, crystal-covered socks Jackson wore at the legendary "Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever" TV special in 1983 are now hitting the auction block.</p>
      <p>And these socks won't come cheap. Gotta Have Rock and Roll, the online auction site offering the socks, estimates the pair will go for <a href="https://www.gottahaverockandroll.com/Michael_Jackson__Motown_25__Yesterday__Today__Fore-LOT29101.aspx">upwards of $2 million</a>.</p>
      <p>The auction starts November 13, and bidding is set to begin at $100,000.</p>
      <p>Ed Kosinski, CEO of Gotta Have Rock and Roll, said the socks look "heavily worn," but he couldn't say for sure how often they were worn after the Motown show.</p>
      <p>The socks aren't the only Jackson memorabilia to go on sale. His "Suit of Lights" from his "Victory Tour" era is expected to fetch upwards of $20,000. A Chicago Bulls jersey signed by Jackson and Michael Jordan is also expected to get up to $20,000.</p>
      <p>Despite these high price tags, Jackson's legacy has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/07/entertainment/michael-jackson-documentary-reexamining-legacy-trnd/index.html">become controversial</a> -- most notably after the release earlier this year of HBO's "Leaving Neverland" documentary, chronicling Jackson's alleged sexual abuse of two men when they were children.</p>
      <p>Jackson, who died in 2009 at age 50, wasn't ever convicted of a crime and denied similar allegations when he was alive. His family has called the documentary a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/entertainment/michael-jackson-documentary/index.html">"public lynching"</a> and<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/21/entertainment/leaving-neverland-hbo-suit/index.html"> has filed a suit against HBO</a>. (HBO and CNN share parent company WarnerMedia.)</p>
      <p>For those who may feel conflicted about Jackson's legacy, the auction also has options not related to the star.</p>
      <p>A lock of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/26/us/kurt-cobain-cardigan-trnd/index.html">Kurt Cobain's</a> hair, for example, is expected to fetch <a href="https://www.gottahaverockandroll.com/Kurt_Cobain_s_Hair_In_Signed_Pink_Heart_Box-LOT29417.aspx">up to $12,000</a>. It even comes in a little heart-shaped box.</p>
