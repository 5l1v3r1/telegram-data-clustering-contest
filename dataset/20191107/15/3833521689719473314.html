      <p>TORONTO -- Hydro One Ltd. reported that its third-quarter profit rose compared with a year ago, helped by lower costs, partially offset by lower revenue due to less favourable weather.</p>
      <p>The Ontario power utility says it earned $241 million or 40 cents per diluted share for the quarter ended Sept. 30.</p>
      <p>That compared with a profit of $194 million or 32 cents per diluted share a year ago.</p>
      <p>Revenue totalled $1.59 billion, down from nearly $1.61 billion.</p>
      <p>On an adjusted basis, Hydro One says it earned 40 cents per share for the quarter compared with an adjusted profit of 38 cents per share a year ago.</p>
      <p>Analysts on average had expected a profit of 37 cents per share and revenue of nearly $1.65 billion, according to financial markets data firm Refinitiv.</p>
      <p>"Our main focus has been and will remain operational excellence as we continue to drive performance," Hydro One chief executive Mark Poweska said in a statement.</p>
