      <p>Michigan emo/pop punk band Fireworks went on hiatus in 2015 after releasing their third album, <i>Oh, Common Life</i> (on Triple Crown), and today they re-appeared with a <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreFireworks/status/1192472788067590151">tweet</a> pointing to the website <a href="https://www.higherlonelypower.com/">higherlonelypower.com</a>, where they’re streaming a new song, “Demitasse.” It’s very different from anything they’ve done before; it’s a soaring, post-rocky song fueled by somber piano, ambient textures, sputtering percussion, and choir-like vocal harmonies. It isn’t even remotely any offshoot of “punk” until about five minutes in, and even at that point, it’s a much more majestic thing than your average emo/pop punk band. If Fireworks are planning a full reunion and more music like this, then they found a very, very good reason to come back. Listen <a href="https://www.higherlonelypower.com/">here</a>.</p>
