      <h2>De Bruyne will play a key role in City’s midfield</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Kevin_De_Bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a> is relishing the challenge as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> prepare for this weekend’s crunch clash at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> champions head to Anfield on Sunday for their first meeting of the season with the Merseysiders, who lead the table by six points.</p>
      <p>They do so on the back of a 1-1 draw with Atalanta in Milan in the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Champions-League">Champions League</a> on Wednesday, a result which meant City still have work to do to a secure a last-16 spot.</p>
      <p>But with a five-point lead in Group C and two fixtures still to play, that should be a formality. Sunday’s encounter is a far more pressing issue and De Bruyne is looking forward to playing in a formidable Anfield atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The Belgian said: “I prefer to play in that than when there is nobody. Professionals want to play in front of 50, 60, 70, 80 thousand people and it makes it worthwhile.</p>
      <p>“You train all your life to get to the big stages. I want to compete for titles and to be the best, and to do that you have to win against the best.</p>
      <p>“The media will make a lot of it, and people have been talking about it for the whole week, even before the Champions League, but we just do our job, keep calm and prepare ourselves.”</p>
      <p>City, who famously pipped Champions League winners Liverpool to the Premier League title by one point last season, have a poor record at Anfield.</p>
      <p>City have only won there once since Boxing Day 1981, and that was in 2003.</p>
      <p>“I don’t care,” said De Bruyne. “A lot of circumstances will decide the game. What can a player do with statistics like this?</p>

      <p>“It’s a game like another. We know it’s a big game – Liverpool are ahead. We have to go back, recover and be ready for next Sunday.”</p>
      <p>City will be anxiously awaiting updates on goalkeeper Ederson, who was forced off at half-time against Atalanta with a thigh injury.</p>
      <p>His obvious replacement, Claudio Bravo, may also not be high in confidence after being sent off late in the game following his introduction as a substitute.</p>
      <p>City ended the game hanging on for a draw with Kyle Walker in goal.</p>
      <p>It all seemed so different from early in the game when Raheem Sterling rounded off a fine team move to score the opener after seven minutes.</p>
      <p>City failed to build on their advantage and Atalanta responded well to Gabriel Jesus’ missed penalty before half-time, levelling through Mario Pasalic. From then it was they who looked the more likely side.</p>

      <p>De Bruyne said: “We dominated (the first half) and in my estimation it should have been 2-0 or 3-0, and the game is over.</p>
      <p>“We gave them the opportunity to come back and the second half was more difficult.</p>
      <p>“These things happen, but after the red card, we did what we had to do. We weren’t going to play stupid and openly, but we controlled it. It’s a good point.”</p>
      <p>The closing moments also gave Walker, who made one save, something to talk about for years to come.</p>
      <p>“He’s buzzing,” said De Bruyne. “It happens and you have to improvise, and he did his job.”</p>
