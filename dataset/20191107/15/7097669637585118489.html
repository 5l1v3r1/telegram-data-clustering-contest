      <p>I know it may seem a little early to start thinking about holiday shopping, but if you see something on sale that you were planning to get for someone anyway—you get it. This Thursday, there are so many products on sale at Amazon that would make perfect gifts like Sony noise-canceling headphones, digital meat thermometers, and personal blenders. Not only have we tested these items for ourselves, but we've also price tracked them, so you know you're getting a good deal.</p>
      <h3>1. Lowest price: The best noise-canceling headphones</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>When you need some peace and quiet from your relatives this holiday season, just put on a great pair of noise-canceling headphones to zone them out. We named the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones as<a href="https://www.reviewed.com/headphones/best-right-now/best-noise-canceling-headphones"> the best noise-canceling headphones</a> we've ever tested, for both comfort and noise-canceling capabilities. Right now, you can get them for $80off at Drop, which marks its lowest price by $20.</p>
      <p>They earned the top spot because not only do they block out various sounds, but you can actually customize how much or how little you want to hear using an intuitive app and you can pause your music with just a tap of an earphone. Plus, they make a great gift for any playlist perfectionist or podcast lover.</p>
