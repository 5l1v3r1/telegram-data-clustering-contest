      <p>NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched record closing highs on Thursday as the latest signs of progress in U.S.-China trade relations relieved investors, but a report raising fresh worries about the outlook for a deal limited the day’s gains.</p>

      <p>China said it had agreed with the United States to remove tariffs in phases, while state-owned Xinhua News Agency said Beijing was also considering removing restrictions on poultry imports.</p>
      <p>But indexes pared gains in afternoon trading after a Reuters report, citing sources, said that the White House’s plan to roll back China tariffs faces internal opposition and that no final decision has been made yet.</p>
      <p>An interim U.S.-China trade deal is expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec. 15.</p>
      <p>“Any kind of uncertainty there, with the market at all-time highs, and it’s easy for traders and institutions to press the sell button and take some money off the table,” said Alan Lancz, president, Alan B. Lancz &amp; Associates Inc, an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
      <p>The latest batch of earnings offered some upbeat news.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 technology index .SPLRCT ended up 0.7%, with shares of Qualcomm Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/QCOM.O">QCOM.O</a>) up 6.3% after it forecast current-quarter profit above analysts’ estimates.</p>
      <p>Together with Qualcomm, other chipmakers, which have a sizeable exposure to China, also rose, propping the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX up 0.7%.</p>
      <p>The trade-sensitive industrials sector .SPLRCI finished up 0.2%.</p>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.DJI">.DJI</a> rose 182.24 points, or 0.66%, to 27,674.8, the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.SPX">.SPX</a> gained 8.4 points, or 0.27%, to 3,085.18 and the Nasdaq Composite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=.IXIC">.IXIC</a> added 23.89 points, or 0.28%, to 8,434.52.</p>
      <p>The day’s gains resumed the recent record run for stocks, which have been bolstered, along with trade deal hopes, by some upbeat earnings.</p>
      <p>“Corporate earnings, while down year over year, are better than many had expected, and that’s a plus,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist of Bruderman Asset Management in New York.</p>
      <p>Also on Thursday, Ralph Lauren Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/RL.N">RL.N</a>) surged 14.7% after it topped second-quarter profit expectations, helped by a tighter control on expenses and strong demand for its Polo shirts and tweed jackets in China and Europe.</p>
      <p>On the down side, Expedia Group Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/EXPE.O">EXPE.O</a>) plunged 27.4% as the online travel booking company missed quarterly profit estimates.</p>
      <p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 posted 54 new 52-week highs and five new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 118 new highs and 85 new lows.</p>
      <p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.92 billion shares, compared with the 6.83 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.</p>
