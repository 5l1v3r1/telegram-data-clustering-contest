      <p>Virgin Media has dropped BT-EE for Vodafone as it strikes a new five year mobile deal.</p>
      <p>The current deal with BT will come to an end in 2021, but that won't stop Virgin rolling out its Vodafone supported 5G before then, which is good news for its three million customers.</p>
      <p>"This agreement with Vodafone will bring a host of fantastic benefits and experiences to our customers, including 5G services in the near future," says Virgin Media CEO, Lutz Schüler. "Twenty years ago Virgin Mobile became the world’s first virtual operator and this new agreement builds on that heritage.</p>
      <p>"It will open up a whole new world of opportunity for Virgin Media as we focus on becoming the most recommended brand for customers and bring our mobile and broadband connectivity closer together in one package for one price.”</p>
      <p>Apparently the company will still be working with BT "in a number of areas" but says it wants its customers to "have a limitless experience" and Vodafone will allow the network to "grow further and faster".</p>

      <p>So Virgin Mobile customers can look forward to getting in on Vodafone's 5G sometime soon. [<a href="https://mediacentre.vodafone.co.uk/news/new-mvno-virgin-media/">Vodafone</a> via <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/virgin-mobile-drops-bt-ee-for-vodafone">TechRadar</a>]</p>
