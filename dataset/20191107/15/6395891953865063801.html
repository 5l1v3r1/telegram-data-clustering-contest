      <p>A group of more than 100 black female activists is endorsing Elizabeth Warren for president, saying her stances on a range of issues speak directly to black voters.</p>
      <p>In a letter released on Thursday, the group Black Womxn For says its endorsement is an extension of activism that has helped shape a progressive agenda in the 2020 Democratic primary. The group calls Warren a "leader" and "partner" with a proven track record and understanding of structural racism and inequality who is willing to be held accountable.</p>
      <p>The group's director, Angela Peoples, says she hopes the letter will encourage other black women to support the Massachusetts senator publicly.</p>
      <p>Warren is scheduled to visit the historically black college North Carolina A&amp;T State University later Thursday.</p>
