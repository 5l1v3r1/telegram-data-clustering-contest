      <h1>RIL-Network 18 deal: Tribunal asks Sebi to pass order by November 30</h1>
      <h2>However, more than one year have elapsed and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has not taken a decision</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:05:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday asked <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/markets">markets </a>regulator <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>to pass an order by the end of November in the matter of Reliance Industries' acquisition of Network18 Media &amp; Investments (NW18) and TV18 Broadcast (TV18). The order comes following an appeal filed by Victor Fernandes and Sangeeta Fernandes seeking further direction from the tribunal.</p>
      <p>The tribunal, in June last year, had directed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>to re-examine whether there have been violations of listing agreement with respect to Reliance Industries' acquisition of Network18 Media &amp; Investments (NW18) and TV18 Broadcast (TV18).</p>
      <p>Besides, the regulator was asked to check whether <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/reliance-industries">Reliance Industries </a>Ltd (RIL) acquired indirect control of the two companies through Independent Media Trust (IMT).</p>
      <p>However, more than one year have elapsed and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has not taken a decision and consequently, the applicants filed an application seeking further direction from the tribunal. Consequently, the SAT directed "<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sebi">Sebi </a>to ensure that an order is passed pursuant to the earlier order of this Tribunal dated June 22, 2018 on or before November 30, 2019".</p>
      <p>Fernandes, in their complaints, alleged that RIL had failed to disclose that it had acquired indirect control over NW18 and TV18 through IMT, a trust established in November 2011 for the exclusive benefit of RIL.</p>
