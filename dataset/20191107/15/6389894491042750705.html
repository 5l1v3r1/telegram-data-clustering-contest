      <p>Commerzbank has warned that its profit for the year will be below previous expectations, as lower for longer interest rates take their toll on the German banking giant.</p>
      <p>Citing the negative impact of monetary policy and geopolitical uncertainty, the lender said that net profit for the year would be lower than last year.</p>

      <p>“Consolidated net income for the 2019 financial year is expected to be lower than in the previous year,” the bank said.</p>
      <p>Despite the outlook, the firm posted net profit in the third quarter of €294m, rising from €218 in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Like its peer Deutsche Bank, the German lender has struggled amid higher costs and tough trading conditions.</p>

      <p>“The European banking sector continues to remain challenging as Commerzbank once again downgraded its profit outlook, the second time the bank has done in this in a matter of weeks,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets,</p>
      <p>He added: “CEO Martin Zielke also unveiled a raft of new cost cutting measures. Zielke reiterated his plan to sell off its Polish bank MBank, an incomprehensible decision when you consider the challenges the bank faces domestically.</p>
      <p>“MBank is one of the areas where margins are good, and while a sale would improve cash flow in the short term, its hardly conducive to improving the banks long term future.”</p>
