      <p>New Delhi - Two former<b> Indian Premier Leagu</b><b>e</b> players have been arrested for spot-fixing in a scandal-ridden regional tournament, police said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Wicketkeeper-batsman <b>CM Gautam</b> and <b>Abrar Kazi </b>were arrested in Bangalore by a special unit investigating corruption and fixing in the Karnataka Premier League.</p>
      <p>Gautam, the 33-year-old former captain of Bellary Tuskers, and teammate Kazi allegedly accepted $28,000 each for "slow batting" in this year's tournament final against Hubli Tigers. The Tuskers lost the game by eight runs.</p>
      <p>"The Central Crime Branch has made two important arrests in the KPL spot-fixing scandal," Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police, told AFP, naming Gautam and Kazi.</p>
      <p>"They did spot-fixing in the KPL 2019 finals between Hubli and Bellary. They were paid two million rupees ($28,000) for slow batting.</p>
      <p>"Also, they fixed another match against the Bangalore team. Further investigations are on and more arrests will be made."</p>
      <p>Cricket has become a key battleground in the fight against spot-fixing -- illegal bets on a certain part of the action, such as how many runs are scored in an over.</p>
      <p>The KPL has been under growing suspicion since Ashfaq Ali Thara, owner of a KPL team and a side in the Dubai T20 League, was arrested for placing bets and a possible role in fixing matches.</p>
      <p>Two more players were arrested on charges of betting and match-fixing.</p>
      <p>The IPL, the world's wealthiest national league, was hit by a spot-fixing scandal in 2013 which resulted in two teams being banned for two years.</p>
      <p>Gautam was in the squad for Royal Challengers Bangalore, Mumbai Indians and Delhi Daredevils in the IPL. Kazi played one game for Bangalore in 2011.</p>
      <p>Twenty20 leagues around the world including the Pakistan Super League, Bangladesh Premier League and Dubai league have been hit by fixing scandals.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Test captain Shakib Al Hasan was banned for two years last month after failing to report approaches by bookies.</p>
