      <h1>DA's downward by-election trend recovers, mixed bag for ANC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:40:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jan Gerber</a></address>
      <p>During Wednesday's by-elections, the ANC and DA retained the wards they previously held.</p>
      <p>In the case of the DA, this is in contrast to recent by-election results in various regions after the May 2019 national elections, in which the party bled support.</p>
      <p>For instance, in the <a href="https://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/anc-ff-plus-take-ward-each-from-da-as-party-loses-support-in-key-by-elections-20190919">September by-elections</a>, in four of the five wards the DA held in which by-elections were contested, its support dropped more than 20 percentage points, causing the party to lose two wards, one to the ANC and one to the FF Plus.</p>
      <p>In Wednesday's by-elections, the DA retained Ward 2 in the Blue Crane Municipality in the Eastern Cape, with 53.45% of the vote. In 2016, it got 59.09% of the vote.</p>
      <p>At the by-election at the Msunduzi Municipality, which includes the regional hub Pietermarizburg, the DA held its ward and increased its support with two percentage points from 44.04% in 2016 to 46.94%.</p>
      <p>DA spokesperson Solly Malatsi said the results are encouraging and show their offer still resonates with many South Africans.</p>
      <p>"We hope we can continue to build on this momentum going into the next series of by-elections."</p>
      <p>The next by-elections will take place next week.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was a bit of a mixed bag for the ANC, with its support remaining strong in the Eastern Cape, but seemingly waning in KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
      <p>The party's support remained around the 94% mark in the ward Ngqushwa in the Eastern Cape, and it showed a 20 percentage points increase in the by-election in Umzimvubu, also in the Eastern Cape, surging from 76.15% in 2016 to 96.61% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>At Umzumbe in KwaZulu-Natal, it dropped almost 30 percentage points, from 89.23% in 2016 to 60.74% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In Mpofana, also in KwaZulu-Natal, the ANC lost 13 percentage points compared to 2016, dropping from 53.29% to 40.08%.</p>
      <p>The drop in support was less marked in Kwadukuza, where the party dropped from 59.18% to 57.53%.</p>
      <p>ANC KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Ricardo Mthembu in a statement thanked the voters who help them retain their wards.</p>
      <p>"These results are a clear indication that the people appreciate our efforts to reconnect with them and we commit ourselves to redouble our efforts to address the challenges they face," he said.</p>
      <p>"We congratulate the DA for its victory in Msunduzi and also congratulate the IEC (Electoral Commission of SA) for delivering a credible, free and fair elections."</p>
