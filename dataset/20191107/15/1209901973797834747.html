      <p>They say the boys were found dead when officers arrived at the scene.</p>
      <p>Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown tweeted about the incident this morning, calling it “heart breaking.”</p>
      <p>“If this is indeed a case, domestic or familial related homicides it is unfathomable,” he said on Twitter. “As a parent, I just can’t comprehend this. The crisis that lead to this is yet unknown. But our whole community is grieving.”</p>
      <p>Homicide and missing persons investigators are still working to figure out what happened at the scene.</p>
