      <p><b>COVER STORY:</b> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/with-deepest-sympathy-modern-loss-the-complications-of-coping-with-grief/">With deepest sympathy: The complications of coping with grief</a> | <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/with-deepest-sympathy-addressing-grief/">Watch Video</a><br/>Dealing with death is simply part of living life, as every person who dies leaves behind loved ones who must face a grieving process. And while most of us eventually adapt to a "new normal," one in 10 endures what researchers calls "complicated grief." For them the acute phase of grief never lets up. Susan Spencer investigates the study of grief, and how a website, Modern Loss, is sharing personal stories of grief, loss and coping from around the world, sometimes with unexpected twists.</p>
      <p><b>BOOK EXCERPT: </b><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-excerpt-modern-loss-candid-conversation-about-grief-beginners-welcome/">"Modern Loss: Candid Conversation About Grief. Beginners Welcome."</a><br/>Rebecca Soffer writes that, when communing about grief in a social media era, no "like" can replace a conversation, or a hug, or shared double martinis.</p>
      <p><b>BOOK EXCERPT:</b> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-excerpt-black-widow-by-leslie-gray-streeter/">"Black Widow" by Leslie Gray Streeter</a><br/>The Palm Beach Post columnist recounts the terrible night when her life was turned upside-down, and her unplanned, forced accommodation to the newly-dominant emotion of grief.</p>
