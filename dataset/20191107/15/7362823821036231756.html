      <h1>Bill Bennett: Bill Gates is right, Elizabeth Warren's 'Medicare-for-all' plan is 'crazy'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Sen. Elizabeth Warren's</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warrens-52t-medicare-for-all-plan-revealed-campaign-still-claims-no-middle-class-tax-hikes-needed">"Medicare-for-all" plan</a> is crazy, former Secretary of Education Dr. Bill Bennett said Thursday, arguing the middle class will see big tax increases if the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/2020-presidential-election">2020 Democratic</a> front-runner's plans are ever enacted.</p>
      <p>Speaking with reporters in Iowa this week, the Massachusetts senator claimed that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-under-fire-as-she-now-claims-billionaires-alone-can-fund-medicare-for-all">billionaires alone could potentially fund</a> her $52 trillion "Medicare-for-all" proposal.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t raise taxes on anybody but billionaires,” Warren said. “And you know what? The billionaires can afford it, and I don’t call them middle class.”</p>

      <p>In an interview with The New York Times on Wednesday, Microsoft founder Bill Gates – who has a net worth over $100 billion – said <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/bill-gates-attacks-elizabeth-warren-tax-policy">he found Warren's pitch to be too much</a>. The plan would hit billionaires, banks and corporations the hardest. Warren has promised her constituents that the middle class will not be hit with a tax hike.</p>
      <p>"I've, uh, paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes (audience laughs). I'm glad to have — if I had to pay $20 billion, it's fine. But when you say I should pay $100 billion, OK, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have leftover," he said.</p>

      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">"America's Newsroom"</a> with host Sandra Smith, Bennett said Gates was right.</p>
      <p>"I don't weep for Bill Gates and this tax bill. He's probably got plenty to spare no matter what. But, I do weep for the middle class. This was a crazy thing that Elizabeth Warren did," said the Fox News contributor.</p>
      <p>"It's not only crazy as policy," he added. "But it is really also, I think, going to hurt her and the whole <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrat Party</a>."</p>

      <p>Bennett added that Warren's plan has drawn harsh criticism from both sides of the aisle.</p>
      <p>"A friend of mine says by laying out the details of her proposal for 'Medicare-for-all' and the price tag here, that she has written the longest political suicide note in history. And, that was a Democrat friend who said that," he told Smith.</p>
      <p>"This will weigh her down; it will weigh down the Democrat Party. When Bill Gates starts objecting, you have a problem," he concluded.</p>
