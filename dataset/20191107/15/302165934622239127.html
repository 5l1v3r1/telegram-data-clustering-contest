      <p>MUNICH, Nov 7 — Managerless Bayern Munich reached the Champions League last 16 yesterday with two games to spare as Robert Lewandowski helped inspire a low-key 2-0 win over Olympiakos.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski’s goal, his 21st in 17 games this season, was the highlight of a dull encounter at the Allianz Arena before substitute Ivan Perisic added a late second.</p>
      <p>The victory ensures Group B leaders Bayern reach the knockout stage for the 12th straight season.</p>
      <p>“We defended very high, put the opponent under pressure again and again and were dominant,” said interim coach Hansi Flick.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old Flick got off to a winning start having stepped in after Niko Kovac was sacked as head coach on Sunday following a 5-1 drubbing at Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.</p>
      <p>Bayern expect to name a new boss by their next away game at Fortuna Duesseldorf on November 23, but Ajax coach Erik ten Hag and Paris Saint-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel have already ruled themselves out.</p>
      <p>According to German daily <i>Bild</i>, Bayern are in talks with former Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, who was evasive when asked directly about the Bayern vacancy by <i>beIN Sports</i> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Kovac’s sacking, sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic called for a “positive” display, but Bayern’s stars struggled to deliver.</p>
      <p>“It was a hard win, we weren’t rewarded enough for our work, and when we were, it was late,” said Thomas Mueller after both goals came in the final half an hour.</p>
      <p>“We were dominant and aggressive, we did what we had done in training, we didn’t let them breathe, but we didn’t take enough advantage of our pressing.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say I’m relieved, just happy to have won at home by being dominant.”</p>

        <b>Coutinho dropped </b>
      </p>
      <p>Flick, Germany’s assistant coach when they won the 2014 World Cup, made two key changes by dropping Thiago Alcantara and Philippe Coutinho, both of whom were poor at Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Leon Goretzka took Alcantara’s place in midfield, with Mueller replacing Coutinho and Javi Martinez playing at centre-back instead of Jerome Boateng, who was sent off against Eintracht.</p>
      <p>Just a month ago, Bayern trounced Tottenham 7-2 in north London with Serge Gnabry scoring four goals, but the German champions could not match that display.</p>
      <p>Their first clear chance came when winger Kingsley Coman cut inside with 33 minutes gone, but fired at Olympiakos goalkeeper Jose Sa.</p>
      <p>The ‘keeper then denied Mueller moments later, while right-back Benjamin Pavard headed off the post on the stroke of half-time.</p>
      <p>Bayern had a better start to the second half as Goretzka’s header forced Sa into a good save.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski broke the deadlock on 69 minutes when he flicked Kingsley Coman’s low cross past Sa.</p>
      <p>The second goal was created by two second-half substitutes as Corentin Tolisso’s ball found its way to Perisic, who lashed the ball into the net. — AFP</p>
