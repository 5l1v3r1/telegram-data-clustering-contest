      <p>Mangoes spilling from an overturned tractor trailer caused a messy morning commute on Maryland beltway.</p>
      <p>The mango truck overturned early Wednesday morning on I-495 in Bethesda.</p>
      <p>Montgomery County Fire &amp; Rescue Service spokesman Pete Piringer told a reporter that one person suffered minor injuries.</p>
      <p>No word on what caused the truck to roll over, but the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/11/06/holy-mangoes-truck-carrying-fruit-overturned-bethesda/">Washington Post reports</a> traffic was backed up for miles when two lanes of the highway were closed around 6am.</p>
