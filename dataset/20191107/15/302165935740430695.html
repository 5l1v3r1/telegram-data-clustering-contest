      <p>ORLANDO, Nov 7 — Rob Greenfield needs a lift. He often does, as he doesn’t own a car.</p>
      <p>Ride sharing is one of the many ways in which he tries to reduce his carbon footprint — but the other is more extreme. For the past year, he hasn’t spent a cent on food.</p>
      <p>He only eats what he can grow in his own garden or nearby gardens, what he can fish for — or what he can peel off the highway.</p>
      <p>Yes, roadkill is an option for the 33-year-old Greenfield. He’s an urban forager.</p>
      <p>“Nature has been my garden, has been my pantry and it’s been my pharmacy,” explains the environmental activist, whose one-year challenge to eat only what he can find himself ends on November 10.</p>
      <p>Greenfield launched the project in Orlando, the theme park capital of the world in central Florida. The greater metropolitan area is home to about 2.5 million.</p>
      <p>It seems like an unusual place to hunt and gather, but the subtropical climate has helped him offset the urban setting.</p>
      <p>“For the last year, I’ve been growing and foraging 100 per cent of my food — no grocery stores, no restaurants, no beer at a bar,” Greenfield tells AFP.</p>
      <p>“I want to inspire people to question their food and then to change their diets, to start to grow their own food, to support local farmers and eat in a way that is better for the Earth, our communities and ourselves.”</p>

        <b>Backyard cuisine</b>
      </p>
      <p>He’s been living in a tiny home in someone else’s backyard — the owners said he could squat there for the purposes of the project.</p>

      <p>He’s usually barefoot and wears the clothes he’s often seen in on YouTube, where’s he documented his year of foraging.</p>
      <p>“I think that the human body developed really well over tens of thousands of years and I don’t believe that Nike has got it all figured out in the last blink of the eye of the human experience,” he says.</p>
      <p>Greenfield has transformed the yard into an urban farm — papayas, bananas, sweet potatoes, eggplant, cucumbers and peppers are all thriving.</p>
      <p>He put together an open-air kitchen of sorts, where he keeps his provisions and the honey he produces himself from four honeycombs.</p>
      <p>He’s also built a toilet al fresco — and uses leaves for toilet paper, explaining: “This is softer than anything you can buy at the store.”</p>
      <p>During the interview, he feasts on a bowl of venison, sauerkraut, green papaya, turmeric, red pepper, coriander, garlic, dill and sea salt, cooked in coconut milk.</p>
      <p>His breakfast is capped with some moringa leaves, which had numerous medicinal uses.</p>
      <p>Greenfield found the dead deer on a road in his native Wisconsin, where he spent his summer vacation.</p>
      <p>And the salt? “I go to the ocean and I collect the saltwater from the ocean. I just fill up a jar or a jug and then I put that onto a stove to boil it down. That makes good sea salt.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The simple life</b>
      </p>
      <p>Greenfield says that he first made the decision to live more “simply” in 2011.</p>
      <p>Up until then, he was living what he called a “pretty typical American life.” His goal: “To be a millionaire by the time I was 30.”</p>
      <p>In 2014, he dissolved his marketing company.</p>
      <p>He first earned public attention in 2016, when he walked through New York wearing all of the garbage he produced — an effort to call attention to the huge amount of waste generated by Americans.</p>
      <p>After that, he decided to start his experiment in urban foraging, to cast a spotlight on the possibilities of sustainable living.</p>
      <p>He lives off public speaking fees and proceeds from his books, though he usually offers talks for free. This year so far, he has earned just US$9,760 (RM40,461). In 2018, the total was US$8,000.</p>
      <p>Both are well below the poverty level of about US$13,000 for an individual living alone.</p>
      <p>“For me, this is about deeply exploring my food and understanding it and at the same time taking people along on this journey,” Greenfield says.</p>
      <p>He says he donates most of what he earns to non-profit organisations — despite a fair bit of media coverage of his story, he says he wants to avoid getting rich from his projects.</p>
      <p>“It’s about the message, and I don’t think I should get wealthy off of the message of helping others,” he says.</p>
      <p>“I’ve created a system to help myself not ever lose those good intentions. I believe in living humbly and I don’t think it would be easy to live humbly with a lot of money.”</p>
      <p>Once he’s finished on Sunday, Greenfield is not sure what comes next — for now, he’s planning on travelling around the world. — AFP</p>
