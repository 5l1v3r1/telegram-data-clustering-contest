      <p>A witness is heard telling the driver, “Damn, you’re f---ing your s--- up.”</p>
      <p>Another man, seemingly to be with her, is seen standing in front of the Toyota before banging on the window and telling the car to back up. Off camera, someone can be heard encouraging the man to “open her door” and “bust the windows.”</p>

      <p>Since the sandwich returned to stores Sunday after a two-month hiatus, Popeyes has been plagued with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-returns">long-lines</a>, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/popeyes-fight-maryland">fights</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/28-year-old-man-fatally-stabbed-at-maryland-popeyes-after-fight-over-chicken-sandwich-police-confirm">one fatality</a> when a man tried to cut in line at a Maryland location Monday night.</p>
      <p>Popeyes has not commented on the violence that has been sparked over the sandwich.</p>
