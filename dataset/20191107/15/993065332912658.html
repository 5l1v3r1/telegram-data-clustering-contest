      <p>A CO Down man has obtained a High Court injunction against a self-styled paedophile hunter who branded him a child sex offender on Facebook.</p>
      <p>He took action after being named in a series of online posts and allegedly subjected to a "sting operation" where a group confronted him at his home.</p>
      <p>The man, who cannot be identified, secured an order to prevent any further harassment, intimidation or material about him appearing on the social media network.</p>
      <p>He is also seeking damages against Facebook and the suspected operator of the page Not One Nonce Can Escape (NONCE).</p>
      <p>According to his lawyers he was accused of being a paedophile in a number of posts accompanied by images and videos about him.</p>
      <p>Last weekend a group of people were said to have turned up at his family home.</p>
      <p>Disturbances in the street involved neighbours being told the man is a paedophile and that they should watch their children, it was claimed.</p>
      <p>He was arrested by police called to the scene, but later released on bail without charge.</p>
      <p>Facebook has also been listed as a defendant in the case as some of the material allegedly remains on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>The man contends that the company's own reporting mechanism is inadequate, and that so-called paedophile hunter groups should not be allowed on the network.</p>
      <p>His solicitor, Ciaran Moynagh of Belfast firm Phoenix Law, said he is now terrified his home will be targeted again.</p>
      <p>The lawyer claimed his client's personal safety is now at risk, with material still online causing further damage to his reputation.</p>
      <p>An interim injunction was granted at a hearing before Mrs Justice Keegan, who listed the case for a review next week.</p>
      <p>Outside court, Mr Moynagh said: "There is a misguided belief by many that these so-called paedophile hunters are doing society a service. It is quite the opposite.</p>
      <p>"They are destroying the lives of entire families and have little, if anything, to show for it in terms of successful prosecutions or protecting children.</p>
      <p>"Time and time again, these groups have been told to stop. The priority must be to protect the vulnerable in society but this is not the way to do it."</p>
