      <h1>Helen Mirren says it's "flattering" to be mistaken for Keanu Reeves' girlfriend — but no, she's not dating him</h1>

      <p>When Keanu Reeves confirmed his relationship with artist Alexandra Grant on Saturday, the Twitter world went into a tizzy. Who exactly is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/people-have-noticed-that-keanu-reeves-respectfully-does-not-touch-women-in-photos/">the heartthrob's</a> new girlfriend?</p>
      <p>One thing is for sure, she's not Helen Mirren — even though many people couldn't help but notice a striking resemblance between Grant and the famous actress.</p>
      <p>Grant, 46, has silver hair like Mirren, and during her first public outing with Reeves, she wore her hair in a similar style to the 74-year-old actress.</p>

      <p>Many people did a double take, assuming Reeves was arm and arm with Mirren on the red carpet at the LACMA Art + Film Gala. His date was, in fact, not the iconic actress, but she did catch wind of the relationship rumors.</p>
      <p>"I saw that," Mirren <a href="https://www.etonline.com/helen-mirren-says-it-was-very-flattering-to-be-mistaken-for-keanu-reeves-girlfriend-exclusive">told Entertainment Tonight</a> on Wednesday after many people on social media mistook Grant for Mirren. "That was very flattering on me, you know, because she's obviously lovely."</p>
      <p>Mirren spoke to ET while walking the red carpet for the New York premiere of her new movie "The Good Liar." Her co-star, Ian McKellen, was by her side — not Reeves.</p>
      <p>Mirren is actually in her own relationship — she's been married to director Taylor Hackford for 22 years. Reeves, who is 19 years her junior, is no stranger to her and her husband.</p>
      <p>"I do know Keanu very well," Mirren told ET. "He did a film with my husband and he is just the most adorable, lovely person. So, she's a lucky girl and I'm sure that he's a lucky boy." Reeves starred in Hackford's 1997 horror thriller "The Devil's Advocate."</p>
      <p>While Reeves and Grant just recently stepped out as a couple, they have worked together for years. In 2001, she worked with him on his adult picture book, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/keanu-reeves-finds-humor-in-sad-keanu-image/">"Ode to Happiness,"</a> ET reports.</p>
      <p>Grant and Reeves also collaborated on a book in 2016, later starting a publishing company together, according to ET.</p>
