      <h1>Crypto-Friendly Silvergate Bank Goes Public on New York Stock Exchange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:24:56+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Nikhilesh De</a></address>
      <p>Silvergate Bank, a crypto-friendly bank, officially began selling shares on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.</p>
      <p>Roughly a year after it first filed for its initial public offering, Silvergate began its “IPO day” on the NYSE, according to the stock exchange’s <a href="https://twitter.com/NYSE/status/1192449017386397696">Twitter account</a>. The news comes a day after Silvergate received a “notice of effectiveness” from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nearly-500-crypto-startups-bank-at-silvergate-ipo-filing-reveals">its long-running IPO bid</a> had been accepted.</p>
      <p>The bank currently serves <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000119312519275425/d568616ds1a.htm">more than 750 firms</a> in the crypto space, including exchanges, investors and others, according to an updated IPO prospectus filed in September 2019. </p>
      <p>This is up significantly from the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/silvergate-bank-adds-59-crypto-clients-but-deposits-down-123-million-in-q4">542 clients it reported</a> in March 2019. At the time, while the bank saw its client base grow between November 2018 and March 2019, the assets it held shrank marginally, falling from nearly $1.6 billion to $1.5 billion in the last quarter of 2018.</p>
      <p>In September’s filing, these numbers grew again, holding $1.55 billion in deposits.</p>
      <p>SIlvergate priced its stock pricing at $12 per share on Nov. 6, and is planning to offer 3,333,333 shares of Class A common stock. Just under 1 million of these shares are being offered directly by Silvergate, while shareholders are offering the other 2.5 million, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191106006155/en/Silvergate-Announces-Pricing-Initial-Public-Offering-Common">according to a press release</a>. </p>
      <p>These numbers are more conservative than an updated S1 filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1312109/000119312519275425/d568616ds1a.htm">dated late October 2019</a>, where the company priced each share at a maximum of $15 and sought to raise roughly $65 million overall. If it sells the 3.3 million shares for $12 each, the company will more likely raise approximately $40 million.</p>
      <p>The bank is hoping to sell these shares under the “SI” ticker by Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>Silvergate could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
