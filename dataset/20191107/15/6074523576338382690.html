      <h1>Malaysian Thieves Drill Through Wall to Steal 85 Crypto Machines</h1>

      <p>Malaysian authorities have apprehended five men charged with stealing 85 bitcoin machines. The police captured the men in a police raid on Nov. 2.</p>
      <p>The Sun Daily <a href="https://www.thesundaily.my/local/police-nab-five-for-stealing-85-bitcoin-machines-worth-rm42-500-XN1582808">reports</a> that four men and one woman rented a building in Seremban, Malaysia, adjacent to a warehouse storing the bitcoin machines. The five drilled through the concrete wall connecting the two buildings. All the suspects were friends without past criminal records, The Sun writes.</p>
      <p>Worth $10,300 each, the machines were most likely bitcoin mining rigs, although local police did not specify.</p>
      <p>“On Oct. 29, a shopkeeper lodged a police report following the missing of 85 bitcoin machines,” Seremban police chief Supt Mohd Said Ibrahim said in a press conference. “Subsequently, police conducted raids and arrested suspects, aged between 25 and 46 years.”</p>
      <p>The raids occurred last Saturday night between midnight and 5:00 a.m. local time. Authorities confiscated a car, a four-wheeled vehicle and heavy equipment believed to be used for drilling through the concrete, the Sun added.</p>
      <p>The suspects have yet to be sentenced.</p>
