      <p>Constable Rory Miller, Perth Police Station, said: “Colin has never been missing before.</p>
      <p>"It was when he didn’t turn up for work on Tuesday – after saying that was where he was heading – that the alarm was raised.</p>
      <p>“Colin has worked all over the Highlands and Islands and we have been in touch with previous employers but unfortunately no one has heard from or seen him.</p>
      <p>“He drives a silver Ford Fiesta SW04KUF and this car was on the A82 heading towards Invergarry around 4.15 am on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>“We are keen to hear from anyone who may have seen Colin, or maybe knows where he is, to get in touch. His family are very concerned for him.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We would also ask Colin to call us or his family to let everyone know he is ok.”</p>
