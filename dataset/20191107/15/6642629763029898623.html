      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a>'s top court has annulled a decision from the European Parliament that requested a political group linked to the British political party UKIP to reimburse tens of thousands of euros in EU funds for a lack of impartiality.</p>
      <p>The Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe had been asked to repay 172,655 euros (about $190,000) in 2016 after the European Parliament ruled the group had misspent EU funds on the party's domestic campaign in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>, breaking the bloc's spending rules.</p>
      <p>The ADDE brought the case to court, arguing that the Parliament's bureau, which took the decision, did not include a single representative of "eurosceptic" parties, and that a member of the body made hostile comments towards the party before the decision was made.</p>
      <p>In its ruling Thursday, the European Court of Justice said that "appearances of impartiality were seriously compromised".</p>
