      <p>LONDON, Nov 7 — A second man pleaded guilty yesterday to trying to rob Arsenal stars Mesut Ozil and Sead Kolasinac of their watches in a moped ambush.</p>
      <p>Jordan Northover, 26, admitted trying to steal the expensive items from the Premier League footballers in northwest London on July 25, a court heard.</p>
      <p>Ashley Smith has already pleaded guilty to his role in the attempted raid involving Ozil, 31, and Kolasinac, 26.</p>
      <p>New CCTV footage released by the police shows Kolasinac standing beside his close friend Ozil’s gold-trimmed black Mercedes G class 4x4 before the two attackers pull up.</p>
      <p>Despite being threatened with what appears to be a knife, the burly Bosnia defender remains unfazed.</p>
      <p>The full-back, nicknamed the “Tank”, then chases off the pair, who were disguised by helmets and dark clothing.</p>
      <p>German midfielder Ozil, remains in his vehicle with his wife Amine before speeding off and taking refuge in a Turkish restaurant after being pursued by the raiders.</p>
      <p>Police said a key breakthrough came when a moped without number plates was spotted by a member of the public.</p>
      <p>At a previous court hearing, the value of one of the watches was given as £200,000 (RM1.06 million).</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Jim Corbett said: “Northover and Smith attempted this brazen robbery after travelling around streets nearby, looking for people to rob.</p>
      <p>“Northover didn’t hesitate to draw a weapon when making demands, but he didn’t bargain on being challenged and the pair went away empty-handed.”</p>
      <p>World Cup winner Ozil and full-back Kolasinac were left out of Arsenal’s squad for their opening Premier League game but have since returned to action.</p>
      <p>Ozil told the Athletic website in October that his main concern at the time was his wife’s safety. </p>
      <p>“They told him (Kolasinac) directly, ‘Give us your watch’. Sead’s reaction was really, really brave because he attacked one of the attackers,” Ozil said in the interview.</p>
      <p>“The second one was in front of my car on his moped so I couldn’t drive.</p>
      <p>“We were newly wed and I was scared about my wife. I was scared about Sead. I wasn’t thinking about myself. I was worried they were going to open my wife’s door and they tried, so I reached across her to keep it closed.” — AFP</p>
