        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> have endured varying fortunes in Formula 1 this season and Cyril Abiteboul has accepted these things take time as they battle <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> in the midfield battle.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There was plenty of pressure on the Renault team this season, having finished best of the rest in 2018 they were expected to replicate that if not challenge further up. However, it hasn't gone that way and they've slipped behind McLaren in the midfield, sitting fifth in the Constructors' Championship.Â </p>
      <p>Despite appearing to have gone backwards from where they were, Abiteboul is not embarrassed by slipping behind and battling McLaren and insists these things take time.</p>

        <i>"I think we just need to accept things take time, whether we like it or not. F1 is tough and indeed the fact is that we are getting a better and better understanding of the car and we are capable of improving the set-up, because there is no development of the car, it hasn't moved for a while."</i>
