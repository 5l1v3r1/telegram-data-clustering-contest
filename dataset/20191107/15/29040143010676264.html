      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>T-Mobile hosted its first Un-Carrier event on November 7 for "the New T-Mobile."</li>
        <li>200 million people will have access to T-Mobile's 5G network on December 6.</li>
        <li>The New T-Mobile will offer 14x more coverage thanks to the Sprint merger.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On November 7, <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/">T-Mobile</a> held its first Un-Carrier event since the FCC approved its merger with Sprint. As expected, T-Mobile used much of its latest Un-Carrier initiative to talk about its 5G plans.</p>
      <p>Just about a month from now on December 6, T-Mobile will flip its 5G network live for millions of people across the United States. T-Mobile's using a combination of its low-band frequencies and Sprint's mid-band frequencies, and as a result of this, the New T-Mobile will be able to offer 5G for 200 million people around the country right off the bat on December 6.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile is promoting data speeds of 450Mbps by 2024, which the carrier is touting as being 10x faster than its traditional LTE network. T-Mobile's also stressing just how many people it'll be able to cover with these increased speeds ‚Äî touting that 90% of Americans will get access to them.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and OnePlus 7T Pro 5G will be the initial 5G devices that T-Mobile offers for its 5G network, with more likely being added as more and more phone makers integrate 5G support into their devices.</p>
      <p>T-Mobile's also pushing that it'll offer a 5G coverage map so customers can see exactly where 5G connectivity is offered, compared to carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon that have scattered access in certain cities and specific parts of sports arenas.</p>
