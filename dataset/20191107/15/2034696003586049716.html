        <b>Is it all kicking off again?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/robbie-williams">Robbie Williams</a> has taken aim at <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a>, saying he should “buy yourself a pair of bollocks”.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/take-that">Take That</a> singer today (November 7) responded to a tweet that Gallagher posted earlier this week in which he said he “big fuck off fish to fry”. Williams wrote: “While your [sic] out buy yourself a pair of bollocks.”</p>

      <p>The pair were friends in the ’90s but came at loggerheads on a number of occasions including when Williams challenged Gallagher to a fight during the 2000 Brit Awards.</p>
      <p>Years later, in 2013, Gallagher labelled Williams a “fat fucking idiot” when the latter was given the opportunity to perform at a bigger venue in Manchester.</p>

      <p>One fan wrote: “Robbie trying to start twitter beef to stay relevant 😂😬” while another said: “He’s guna do ya now Robbie.”</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/robbie-williams-calls-fans-go-liam-gallagher-twitter-2463359">Williams said he would still “love” to fight Gallagher</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/robbie-williams-liam-gallagher"><i>GQ</i></a>, he said that he has a “long fucking list of enemies” and admitted that “Liam’s on the list” when asked about their beef.</p>
      <p>“I’d love it. But I’d want it to be a professional fight. I’ve seen how much [YouTubers] KSI and Logan Paul made from theirs and I think we could trounce that. But, yeah, I think last time in the noughties Liam wanted to go down to an abandoned railway track or something. I don’t want to do that,” he said.</p>
