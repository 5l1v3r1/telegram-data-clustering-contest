      <h2>Chris Watts, 34, murdered his pregnant wife Shannan and their two daughters Bella and Celeste before going on TV and feigning concern for their whereabouts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:23:38+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Davidson, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-davidson/</a></address>
      <p>Evil child killer Chris Watts, who murdered his own family in cold blood, says he is 'in his own hell' in prison.</p>
      <p>The dad claims to have found religion while locked up for the slayings of pregnant wife Shanann and their two daughters Bella and Celeste.</p>
      <p>Watts confessed to the sick killings in August 2018 and a source close to him reportedly told People: "A day doesn’t go by — a minute doesn’t go by — where he doesn’t think about his family.”</p>
      <p>The bespectacled murderer killed his own family in a twisted bid to start a new life with the woman he was having an affair with.</p>
      <p>He tried to claim his wife was missing when in reality he had killed her and then their two children before hiding their bodies.</p>

      <p>After being sentenced to multiple life sentences on Nov. 19, 2018, Watts, 34, proclaimed himself a “servant of God,” writing in a letter to his mother last June: “I’m still a Dad! I’m still a son! No matter what. Now, I can add servant of God to that mix!”</p>
      <p>The source tells <a href="https://people.com/crime/chris-watts-his-own-hell-year-after-guilty-plea-murdering-family/">People</a> that Watts is well-aware of the reality of the murders. “It will be over his head for the rest of his life, and there’s no escaping it.”</p>
      <p>“The anniversary isn’t going to be any different from any other day, where he’s in his own hell,” the source says. “He realizes that he’s in a hell of his own making, and he has to live with that.”</p>

      <p>Last November, Watts pleaded guilty to the August 13 2018, murders of Shanann, 34, Bella, four, and Celeste, three.</p>
      <p>In February Watts shed light on horrifying details of the murders.</p>
      <p>He said that Shannan 'may have been' praying as he strangled her to death in their bedroom.</p>
      <p> He said he then drove his wife’s body to his job site at an oil field, where he buried her in a shallow grave as his young daughters waited in the car. Then he smothered both girls and dumped their bodies in two large oil tanks.</p>

      <p>During the confession, Watts said that whenever he closes his eyes, he hears his oldest daughter’s final words begging him not to kill her.</p>
      <p>“Daddy, no!,” Bella reportedly screamed as her father moved in to smother her with the same blanket he’d used to kill her sister Celeste moments before.</p>
      <p>“I hear it every day, when Bella was talking to me,” Watts told police. “When she said, ‘Daddy, no!’”</p>

      <p>The bodies were found three days after they were reported 'missing' with Watts even giving an emotional appeal to TV cameras for their safe return while knowing they were dead.</p>
      <p>Watts had been having an affair with colleague Nicol Kessinger who told police that Watts had lied to her that he was separated from Shannan when they started dating.</p>
