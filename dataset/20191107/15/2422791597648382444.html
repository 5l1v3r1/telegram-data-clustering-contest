      <h1>Semafo suspends Boungou mine after attack that left 37 dead, 60 wounded</h1>

      <p>Montreal-based gold miner Semafo Inc. says it has suspended operations at its Boungou mine in Burkina Faso a day after 37 people were killed and 60 wounded in an ambush on their way to the site.</p>
      <p>Company president and CEO Benoit Desormeaux says the company is "devastated by this unprecedented attack" and extends sympathies to the families and colleagues of the victims.</p>
      <p>A convoy of employees, contractors and suppliers in five buses, escorted by military personnel, were attacked about 40 kilometres from the Boungou mine by unidentified gunmen.</p>
      <p>Semafo says the mine site in the West African country remains secured, but has suspended operations out of respect to the victims and to ensure operational safety.</p>
      <p>In August 2018, a Semafo employee and a subcontractor were killed when a bus carrying workers was targeted by bandits, and five police officers were killed in another attack a few days earlier.</p>
      <p>In response to the two armed incidents, Semafo announced all expatriate employees would be transported by helicopter between the mine and the country's capital Ouagadougou.</p>
