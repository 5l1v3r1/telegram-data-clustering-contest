      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:21:12+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Akshay-Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> may be busy with his many film commitments, but that did not stop him from spending a quiet evening at the movies with his daughter <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nitara">Nitara</a>.</p>
      <p>The father-daughter duo was spotted arriving at a theatre in the city to enjoy a movie together. While Akki looked dashing in a crisp white shirt and black pants, Nitara looked adorable in her floral dress.</p>
      <p>The doting dad even managed to keep the shutterbugs at bay and even tricked a few by opting to take the stairs instead of the elevator.</p>
