      <h1>Borghi claims "Gallardo could be the coach of Barcelona in December"</h1>
      <h2>Valverde remains in charge at Camp Nou but rumours of a replacement have started</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:56:42+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Sport.es</a></address>
      <p>Claudio Borghi, the former World Cup winner with Argentina who now works in the media, has said that River Plate coach Marcelo Gallardo could replace Ernesto Valverde in December.</p>
      <p>Reports in Argentina continue to suggest that Gallardo is a Barça target, despite the fact Barcelona and people close to Lionel Messi have denied any interest in pushing for the coach.</p>
      <p>Barça say they have not made any contact with the Argentine or his people, while Messi's people say the forward has not asked for Gallardo to replace Valverde.</p>
      <p>The latest to comment on the situation is Borghi, who said: "Gallardo could be the coach of Barcelona in December, per information I have. He is one of the best coaches in the world.</p>
      <p>"[River Plate president Rodolfo] D'Onofrio said he'd only leave by quitting his post, but I know this from a direct source."</p>
      <p>Valverde has been in charge since 2017 and has a contract until 2021. He has won La Liga in each of the last two seasons but Champions League disappointment and recent results have seen the pressure go.</p>
