      <h1>British TV channels launch rival to Netflix</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T15:24:16+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>LONDON: </b>The <i>BBC </i>and three smaller British TV channels launched a joint streaming service on Thursday aimed at challenging Netflix’s dominance on the UK market.</p>
      <p>BritBox will offer paid subscriptions that feature popular shows such as the <i>‘Downton Abbey’</i> historical drama and the <i>‘Love Island’</i> reality television hit from the privately-owned <i>ITV</i>.</p>
      <p>The tie-up, whose services are already partially available in the United States and Canada, was expanded Thursday to include publicly-owned Channel 4 and the Viacom-owned Channel 5.</p>
      <p>BritBox is being billed by the four as “the biggest collection of British box sets available in one place”.</p>
      <p>The subscription will initially cost £5.99 ($7.66, 9.92 euros) a month.</p>
      <p>Netflix prices range from £5.99 for its basic service to £8.99 for its standard plan. Amazon Prime’s streaming service also costs £5.99.</p>
      <p>Some analysts say BritBox’s limited investment in original content may spell trouble in a crowded and highly competitive market.</p>
      <p>“Viewers will struggle to differentiate it from Netflix and Amazon, which have long broadcast <i>ITV</i> and <i>BBC</i> programmes,” media analyst Tom Harrington said.</p>
      <p>Figures provided by the <i>BBC</i> and <i>ITV</i> for July show more than 12 million UK households subscribing to at least one streaming service — and four million paying for multiple platforms.</p>
