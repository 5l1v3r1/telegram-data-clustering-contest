      <p>Blue Marlin Ibiza UAE is no doubt one of the <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/bars-nightlife/422179-an-abu-dhabi-bar-and-restaurant-is-serving-dhs10-drinks-this-month">coolest places to party</a>.</p>
      <p>If you <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/things-to-do/417571-things-to-do-in-abu-dhabi-the-new-ladies-night-at-annex">love dancing</a> on a beach (who doesn’t?), it’s one of the best places to be at the weekend, but on Friday November 22 it is putting on something extra special.</p>
      <p>The Hob Festival is set to feature sets from a long list of brilliant DJs including Bahramji &amp; Medusa Odyssey, Frederick Stone, Habibi Funk, Hoolz, Layla Kardan and many more big names.</p>
      <p>But that’s not all.</p>
      <p>You can also start your day at the beach bar by joining in with the pop-up brunch, and enjoy making all your Instagram followers very jealous as you relax on a sunbed and feast on tasty bites from 1pm to 4pm.</p>
      <p>Or, if you want to burn off a few calories before you start <a href="https://www.timeoutabudhabi.com/ladies-nights/415869-abu-dhabis-vakava-now-has-a-hump-day-ladies-night">partying</a> there will be a yoga class held at 10.30am and a dance class at noon.</p>
      <p>We’ll see you on the dancefloor.<br/><i>Dhs84 (entry), Dhs350 (brunch). Fri Nov 22 10.30am onwards. Golden Tulip Al Jazira Hotels and Resort, Ghantoot (056 113 3400).</i></p>
