      <p>One of Britain's most beloved actresses has spoken out in support of a BAFTA competition for unsung heroes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/olivia-colman">Olivia Colman</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/baftas">BAFTA</a> Leading Actress winner 2019, has spoken out in support of the BAFTA "For the Love of Film" competition, which searches the nation for inspiring individuals ad local heroes who have worked hard to help the public access and engage in cinema, with the actress highlighting London’s Peckhamplex when talking about its community spirit.</p>
      <p>Colman said: "It’s really exciting to see BAFTA honour and recognise people who work tirelessly to share the joy of film with their local communities. The ‘For the Love of Film’ competition is an excellent platform to showcase the unsung heroes of the UK’s film industry.</p>
      <p>"A brilliant example of an organisation playing a vital role in making movies accessible to their community is local cinema, Peckhamplex – they provide all films all day at one affordable price, amazing Q&amp;As and special interest weeks. They are really community minded and helpful; I couldn't praise them enough."</p>
