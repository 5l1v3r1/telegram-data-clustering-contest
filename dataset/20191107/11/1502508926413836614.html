      <h1>SC to hear plea against Delhi govt's odd-even scheme on Friday</h1>
      <h2>The petition, filed by a Noida-based advocate, has alleged that the Delhi government's November 1 notification on the scheme also violates fundamental rights</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:15:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The Supreme Court will hear on Friday a plea against the Delhi government's odd-even road rationing scheme, alleging that it is arbitrary, contrary to statutory provisions and is nothing but a "political and vote bank gimmick".</p>
      <p>The petition, filed by a Noida-based advocate, has alleged that the Delhi government's November 1 notification on the scheme also violates fundamental rights.</p>
      <p>"The odd-even vehicle scheme violates the fundamental rights of residents of Delhi and adjoining states who daily commute in/out of Delhi in their four wheeled vehicles to do their jobs/business to earn their livelihood and is ultra vires Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India," the plea said.</p>
      <p>It alleged that the odd-even rule violates citizens' rights to practice any profession, carry out any occupation, trade or business and to move freely throughout the country.</p>
      <p>Questioning the rationale behind the scheme, the plea claimed that three sources of data on Delhi's air-quality, including those by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-pollution">Delhi Pollution </a>Control Committee (DPCC), have confirmed that in the past the odd-even rule did not lower pollution levels in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital.</p>
      <p>"It shows that odd-even is nothing but a political and vote bank gimmick as it has been done capriciously in an unreasonable manner," it said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>started on November 4 and would remain in force till November 15. Under the scheme, four-wheelers with registration numbers ending with odd digits will ply on odd dates and those ending with even digits will ply on even dates.</p>
      <p>The petition said that the odd-even rule is only meant for four-wheelers whereas two wheelers, which cause more pollution in comparison to cars, have been kept out of its ambit.</p>
      <p>The scheme also discriminates between men and women on the basis of gender, the plea claimed. Four-wheelers driven by women are exempted from the odd-even scheme, provided there are no men in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>"Odd-even is nothing but a political gimmick for self-promotion and advertisements in the smoke screen of curbing pollution," it alleged.</p>
      <p>The plea also alleged that there seems to be a strong nexus between stubble-burning framers, political parties, air purifier companies and mask-making companies.</p>
      <p>"The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-government">Delhi government </a>is no Nostradamus (famous French astrologer). Then how come it knows well in advance when smoke from stubble burning will reach Delhi exactly around <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>dates," it said.</p>
      <p>The dates for implementation of the rule were declared on September 13 but the Delhi government's advertisements these days claim that it has been reintroduced as smoke from stubble-burning in neighbouring states is reaching the city.</p>
      <p>A bench of justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta had on November 4 questioned the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delhi-government">Delhi government </a>as to what it was achieving from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-odd-even-scheme">odd-even scheme </a>by stopping plying of cars that are less polluting compared to two and three-wheelers and taxis.</p>
      <p>"Let the Government of NCT of Delhi explain this aspect and file data in this regard in the court on the basis of the previous experience and whether three-wheelers and taxies are plying more on roads during such restrictions and relevant data be placed," the bench had said.</p>
      <p>"During odd-even scheme, what is the difference being caused by stopping use of four-wheelers when various other contributory factors are not taken care of by the Government of NCT of Delhi," it had said.</p>
      <p>The apex court will take up the petition filed against the odd-even scheme along with the pollution matter that is scheduled to be heard on Friday.</p>
