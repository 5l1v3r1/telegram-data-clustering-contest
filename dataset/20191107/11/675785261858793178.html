      <h1>Arsene Wenger claims Aaron Ramsey wanted Arsenal stay - but club withdrew contract</h1>
      <h2>Wales international Aaron Ramsey left Arsenal for Juventus when his contract expired at the end of last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:59:25+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Arsene Wenger says Aaron Ramsey wanted to stay at Arsenal and had an agreement to do so before the club "came back on that".</p>
      <p>Wales international Ramsey left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> on a free when his contract expired at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>Wenger had already left Arsenal at this point, and it was new boss Unai Emery who was in charge when the midfielder departed after nine years.</p>
      <p>Ramsey wanted big money to remain at Arsenal, and Juventus were willing to pay up.</p>
      <p>But despite this, Wenger is adamant Ramsey's heart was set on remaining in north London.</p>

      <p>"Yep. In the end I met him once, he wanted to stay at Arsenal," said Wenger on beIN SPORTS.</p>
      <p>"They had an agreement and the club came back on that, from what I understood. I tried a long time to extend his contract but sometimes you have influences of agents as well.</p>
      <p>"Every case is different and you have to understand in decision makings always who is influential – or not – when you make transfers. What I know from him, he was keen to stay."</p>

      <p>Ramsey has made eight appearances for Juventus this season, and has netted twice.</p>
      <p>The Welshman was on target last time out for the Old Lady in a 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow in the Champions League.</p>
