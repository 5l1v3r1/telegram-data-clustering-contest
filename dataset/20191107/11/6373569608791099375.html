      <h1>Plymouth Argyle boosted by return to full training of Dom Telford and Conor Grant</h1>
      <h2>Telford scored twice in an 11-versus-11 practice match at Home Park on Tuesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:41:15+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Striker Dom Telford and midfielder Conor Grant have both returned to full training with Plymouth Argyle after injury lay-offs.</p>
      <p>They are in contention to be part of <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">the Pilgrims’ squad for the FA Cup first round tie at Bolton Wanderers</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The only player still on the Home Park casualty list is midfielder Jose Baxter, who continues to be sidelined by a calf injury.</p>
      <p>Telford has been out of action since suffering a hamstring injury during the 2-0 home defeat by Cheltenham Town on September 21.</p>
      <p>Argyle have been very cautious with his recovery as it was the second time this season that the 22-year-old had been sidelined this way.</p>
      <p>However, he has trained all week and even scored two goals in an 11-versus-11 practice match between the Pilgrims’ squad at Home Park on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Telford has been limited to five starts and three substitute appearances by his injuries this season.</p>
      <p>Manager Ryan Lowe said: “Dom has trained all week and scored two goals in that 11 v 11. He’s looking sharp.”</p>
      <p>Grant picked up a thigh injury during the 3-0 EFL Trophy win away to Swindon Town on October 8.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has been working with Argyle’s head of fitness and conditioning John Lucas over recent days.</p>
      <p>Grant returned to full training with the rest of the first team squad today, in advance of the trip to Bolton.</p>
      <p>Baxter suffered a calf injury in the 2-2 draw away to Crawley Town on September 17 and it has troubled him ever since.</p>
      <p>He did play as a second half substitute in the 1-1 draw at Swindon on Octo9ber 12, but returned to the casualty list after that.</p>
      <p>Lowe said: “It’s just a waiting game with Jose. He will try and train probably Monday or Tuesday and then we will take it from there to see where he is at.”</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims' boss held the one-hour 11-versus-11 practice match on Tuesday after the postponement of the game against Grimsby Town at Home Park last weekend.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was just to get some volume in their legs and get some patterns of play.</p>

      <p>“We changed the lads around a little bit and we looked at different personnel so it gives you some ideas.</p>
      <p>“We had our team set for Grimsby, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to be the team for Bolton so we looked at one or two things.</p>
      <p>“Our attention turns to Bolton and what style they play, where they pose their threats, and we try and nullify them.</p>
      <p>“Also, in our patterns of play, we need to make sure we are right, and that’s what it was for.”</p>
