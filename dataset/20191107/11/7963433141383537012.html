      <h1>Microsoft's $3,500 HoloLens 2 Starts Shipping</h1>

      <p>Earlier this year at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/19/02/25/0031202/microsoft-announces-hololens-2-mixed-reality-headset-for-3500">second generation of its HoloLens augmented reality visor</a>. Today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/07/microsofts-hololens-2-starts-shipping/">the $3,500 HoloLens 2 is going on sale in the United States</a>, Japan, China, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Australia and New Zealand, the same countries where it was previously available for pre-order. From a report:<i> Ahead of the launch, I got to spend some time with the latest model, after a brief demo in Barcelona earlier this year. Users will immediately notice the larger field of view, which still doesn't cover your full field of view, but offers a far better experience compared to the first version (where you often felt like you were looking at the virtual objects through a stamp-sized window). The team also greatly enhanced the overall feel of wearing the device. It's not light, at 1.3 pounds, but with the front visor that flips up and the new mounting system that is far more comfortable. In regular use, existing users will also immediately notice the new gestures for opening up the Start menu (this is Windows 10, after all). Instead of a 'bloom' gesture, which often resulted in false positives, you now simply tap on the palm of your hand, where a Microsoft logo now appears when you look at it.</i></p>
