      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:55:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan said on Thursday that it has issued a visa to cricketer-turned politician <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/navjot-singh-sidhu">Navjot Singh Sidhu </a>to attend the inauguration of the much-awaited <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>Corridor on November 9.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan government invited Sidhu - who also attended the groundbreaking ceremony of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>Corridor - to attend Saturday's inauguration.</p>
      <p>A ruling party spokesperson had said that Sidhu accepted the invitation, Dawn reported.</p>
      <p>"Pakistan has issued visa to Indian politician <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/navjot-singh-sidhu">Navjot Singh Sidhu </a>for his visit to holy shrine of Baba Guru Nanak," Foreign Office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal announced during his weekly media briefing here.</p>
      <p>Sidhu, a Congress lawmaker and former Punjab minister, has sought permission from the External Affairs Ministry to attend the inaugural ceremony of the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kartarpur">Kartarpur </a>Corridor in Pakistan on November 9.</p>
      <p>He had come under fire from the opposition after he hugged Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa during the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Imran Khan in August last year.</p>
      <p>Sidhu had then claimed that Gen Bajwa had told him about "making efforts to open the Kartarpur Corridor".</p>
      <p>The passport waiver for Kartarpur pilgrims would extend up to one year as a special gesture on the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev, Faisal was quoted as saying by Geo TV.</p>
      <p>Pakistan has also waived the USD 20 service charge per pilgrim per visit on November 9 and November 12, he said, adding that it has also waived the requirement of 10-day advance intimation for the mega ceremony.</p>
      <p>Faisal said Pakistan hoped a massive inflow of Sikh pilgrims from all over the world during the ceremony.</p>
      <p>He said the promotion of Hindu and Buddhist sacred sites situated inside Pakistan was also under consideration as the country was a cradle of ancient civilizations for centuries.</p>
      <p>Rejecting the reports linking Pakistan's efforts on Kartarpur Corridor to encouraging Khalistan movement, Faisal said, "There was no such negativity in our policy."<br/><br/>The Kartarpur Corridor will connect the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in India's Punjab with Darbar Sahib at Kartarpur, just 4 kilometres from the International Border, located at Narowal district of Pakistan's Punjab province.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding a chill in bilateral ties over Kashmir, Pakistan and India after tough negotiations signed a landmark agreement last week to operationalise the corridor to allow Indian pilgrims to visit the holy Darbar Sahib in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>The two countries decided that 5,000 pilgrims can visit the shrine daily. India and Pakistan have also decided that the corridor will be operational through the year and seven days a week and that pilgrims, except kids and elderly persons, will have a choice to visit it as individuals or in groups.</p>
