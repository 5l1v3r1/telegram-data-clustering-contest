      <p>New College Lanarkshire chef lecturer Ann Brown has hosted a healthy eating workshop for kids as part of International Chefs Day.</p>
      <p>Local schoolchildren took part in a lively cooking masterclass based on the theme of “How Healthy Food Works”.</p>
      <p>The workshop, one of hundreds of similar events that took place this month across the globe, was organised by Ann in her capacity as a committee member of the World Chefs organisation.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The organisation has hosted International Chefs Day since 2004 as a way for chefs around the world to give back to their communities through education.</p>
      <p>This year’s theme took a closer look at how food affects the body, including what different foods do for us and why we need them.</p>
      <p>Thirteen children aged between seven and 12 took part in the fun cooking lesson, which was held in the training kitchens of the College’s Motherwell Campus.</p>
      <p>It involved a series of hands-on cooking experiences and games, with each child who participated presented with a certificate.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ann said: “Healthy eating is an important part of education – not only is good nutrition a crucial part of their growth and development, it provides children with more energy, improved health and greater focus in school.</p>
      <p>“The children made a variety of healthy meals and drinks, as well as playing games that taught them how vegetables and fruit help to keep different parts of the body healthy. It means a lot to me to help children understand the benefits of healthy eating. It gives me the opportunity to pass on what I consider to be a way of life.”</p>
      <p>Ann was supported on the day by lecturer Charlotte Hands, HND Patisserie students Chanel Armstrong and Rachel MacInnes, and HNC Patisserie student Sharon Gardner.</p>
