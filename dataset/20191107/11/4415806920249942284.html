      <h1>'Good for Ireland, great for our economy' - McGrath says immigration has positive impact in rural areas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:11:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Immigration is good for the country and positive for rural Ireland, according to Finian McGrath.</p>
      <p>The Dublin North-Central TD made the comments after Minister Michael Ring called for a national debate on immigration and asylum-seekers.</p>
      <p>Recent protests in Galway, Leitrim, Mayo and Roscommon have delayed the opening of a number of direct provision centres.</p>
      <p>Mr McGrath, the minister for disabilities, says the positives of immigration are being completely overlooked:</p>
      <p>"It's good for Ireland, it's great for our economy and it's positive for rural Ireland.</p>
      <p>"In my own sector as minster for disabilities, I couldn't run the services without a lot of immigrant workers.</p>
      <blockquote>I just think it's essential we come up front, we have the debate, we confront any prejudice (and) any form of racism before it gets out of control.</blockquote>
      <p>Mr McGrath added that he believes direction provision can have a positive impact in certain areas:</p>
      <p>"Direct provision is an imperfect system," he admitted. "At the same time, it is the only one we have and there are some amazing people there.</p>
      <p>"We've seen in Wicklow's situation where you have 93 people in the direct provision - over 50% are working.</p>
      <p>"I want to nail a lot of the myths about what's going on because some people are exploiting the situation."</p>
