      <h3>How to watch the Europa League abroad</h3>
      <p>If you’re a British viewer going abroad and want to watch using your existing package, you can use a VPN. This will mean you can still appear as if you're in the UK and retain access to all the location-restricted content.</p>
      <p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3677306-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-europa-league-online-tv-abroad-3677306%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.com">Nord VPN</a> is one of our top recommendations, but you can check out our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/internet/best-vpn-reviews-3657732/">best VPN chart</a>, which shows you some of the best services for accessing UK content from abroad.</p>
      <h3>What about if I don’t want to pay?</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are not many options available if you want to watch the Champions League for free.</p>
      <p>There is no alternative if you'd like to watch on a pay-as-you-go basis, as Sky Sports offers with Now TV. Also, since ITV lost the rights to their highlights package in 2017 there is no coverage on free-to-air television.</p>
      <p>However, BT has reiterated its commitment to make as much of its coverage available to as many people as possible. Clips are regularly shared across the BT Sport social media accounts, with <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3677306-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fhow-to%2Fentertainment%2Fwatch-europa-league-online-tv-abroad-3677306%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fplaylist%3Flist%3DPLubVgegS36EOxr2o52wO2YQ8a5P6LAx1x">highlights available on YouTube</a> minutes after the final whistle.</p>
      <p>The final will also be live streamed to the same channel.</p>
