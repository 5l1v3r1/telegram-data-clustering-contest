      <h3>A jobless man was arrested after his mother reportedly tipped off the police about his alleged illegal drug activities.</h3>
      <p>Acting Quezon City Police District (QCPD) Director, Police Colonel Ronnie S. Montejo,  identified the suspect as Anthony Alvarez alias Tonyo, 44, married and resident of Block 9 Lot 8, Dayap St., Palmera Subdivision, Bgy. Sta Monica, Novaliches.</p>
      <p>Alvarez was arrested by the Station Drug Enforcement Unit (SDEU) of Novaliches Police Station (PS 4) under PLtCol. Rossel Cejas at about 11:45 a.m., Wednesday following a text message from Alvarez’s mother regarding his illegal drug activities.</p>
      <p>Responding operatives seized from the suspect two sachets of shabu, aluminum foil strips with traces of shabu, disposable lighter, and a cellular phone.</p>
      <p>According to the mother, her son has been in and out of a drug rehabilitation center, apparently his drug addiction treatment did not work as he is still hooked into drugs prompting his mother to  seek help from the police.</p>
      <p>The suspect was charged with violation of RA 9165 or The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.</p>
