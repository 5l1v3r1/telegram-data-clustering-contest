      <p>MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - British finance minister Sajid Javid said a new Conservative government would spend up to 20 billion pounds ($25.7 billion)more each year on road, rail and other infrastructure projects, and there would be room for tax cuts too.</p>
      <p>If Boris Johnson is re-elected as prime minister on Dec. 12, Javid said the government would set itself new fiscal rules allowing it to spend up to 3% of annual economic output on infrastructure, higher than a historical average of around 1.8%.</p>
      <p>In a speech in which he painted his plans as “responsible” in contrast to the bigger spending promises of the opposition Labour Party, he said debt as a share of economic output would be lower at the end of the next parliament than at the start.</p>
      <p>Javid said low borrowing costs for the government meant it was a responsible time for the government to invest but he would run a balanced budget for day-to-day spending.</p>
      <p>If debt servicing costs rose sharply, the government would reassess its spending plans, he said.</p>
      <p>Javid also said there would be room for tax cuts if the government stuck to its new fiscal rules.</p>
      <p>“If we stick to these rules that I’ve set out today...we can afford some tax cuts,” Javid told an audience in Manchester.</p>
