      <p>Fearne Cotton has told of her past battle with bulimia.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter, who has previously talked about depression and panic attacks, said the bulimia was caused by imposter syndrome, having been in the limelight at a young age.</p>
      <p>Cotton, 38, told the How To Fail With Elizabeth Day podcast: “I didn’t feel smart enough or like I was good enough for the job.”</p>
      <p>She said stress manifested itself in her 20s with “a disordered relationship with my body and food for 10 years”.</p>

      <p>“It’s been this weird secret that I’ve felt a little bit embarrassed about, a little bit ashamed of, a little bit worried about.</p>
      <p>“I’m still worried now – what people are going to think when I tell this story and share this side of myself? I had that on/off for a good decade of my life.</p>
      <p>“At the beginning of my 20s it was quite intense and sort of ruled everything, and then in my later 20s it was more like a bad habit I would kick into if something emotional was happening or if I felt out of control.”</p>
      <p>The former Radio 1 DJ and Top Of The Pops host said she felt she had “recovered”, adding: “It is the past.”</p>
