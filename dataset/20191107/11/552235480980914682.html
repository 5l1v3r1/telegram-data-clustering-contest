      <h1>Kieran Tierney explains Scotland absence as Arsenal star insists Unai Emery has made him a better player</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal requested the full-back not be selected for Scotland's next round of Euro 2020 qualifiers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:59:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:59</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, Neil McLeman, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Kieran Tierney insists a need for rest is behind his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> absence as he hopes to return for the playoffs in March.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> requested the left-back not be called up for dead rubber Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan amid an "ongoing issue".</p>
      <p>But the 22-year-old form <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> star has made two appearances in four days for his club, completing 90 minutes in a 1-1 Europa League draw with Vitoria SC on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kieran-tierney">Tierney</a>'s comeback from an extended injury lay-off - which included a double hernia operation and a long-term pelvic issue - is being carefully managed but Steve Clarke couldn't help but admit his frustration.</p>
      <p>The defender, however, is adamant the decision will carry long-term benefits and is optimistic he'll be available for the next squad.</p>

      <p>Tierney said: "They (Scotland) understand. Of course you want to play for your national team, but you need to do what is best for your career long term.</p>
      <p>"Tonight this my second game in kind of three, four days so near the end I was tiring.</p>
      <p>"It is probably the right decision as now I am going into the international break knowing I am getting a rest and recovery, because since my operation the load has went up, up and up.</p>
      <p>"To get a rest would be beneficial and hopefully for the next camp I’m ready."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>As his integration into <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/unai-emery">Unai Emery</a>'s first team continues, Tierney admits to feeling the pace.</p>
      <p>He's played every minute of their last three Europa League fixtures, as well as starting in the previous two Premier League games.</p>
      <p>But that won't stop the full-back giving his all as he insisted Emery has already made him a better player.</p>
      <p>"I feel comfortable," Tierney said. "As I say at the end I was tiring, but I try and give 100 per cent.</p>

      <p>"I don’t save myself for maybe the last 15 minutes. I have given my all and if I tire, I tire.</p>
      <p>"Just near the end I was just a wee bit tiring, which is understandable from the load that I have done coming back and coming into Premier League games as well. It is hard."</p>
      <p>Bruno Duarte's stoppage time strike Arsenal surrendered a lead for the fourth time in six games and piled further pressure on beleaguered Emery.</p>
      <p>The past week has been overshadowed by Granit Xhaka's row with fans the Swiss midfielder subsequently being stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Tierney, however, is adamant their fortunes can turn this Saturday as he prepares for a reunion with his former Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers and his high-flying Leicester City side.</p>

      <p>Asked if Emery can inspire a revival, Tierney replied: "Yeah, of course. It is up to us as players to correct it on the pitch. For me, he (Emery) has been brilliant since I’ve come in.</p>
      <p>"I have learned a lot. I am learning a lot every day, playing with great players. Everybody in the changing room has got belief in each other and the manager.</p>
      <p>"Everybody is trying to stay positive, as positive as they can. We know there is a lot going on that people are talking about.</p>
      <p>"But we just need to forget about all that and concentrate on us, concentrate on bouncing back and concentrate on giving the fans something to cheer about.</p>
      <p>"In football it doesn’t always go your way, but we have got another chance on Saturday."</p>
