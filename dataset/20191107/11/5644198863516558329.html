      <p>REUTERS: Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min said it has been a tough few days since his tackle led to Everton midfielder Andre Gomes' terrible ankle injury last weekend but added that it was important for him to focus on football again.</p>
      <p>Son scored twice in Tottenham's 4-0 win over Red Star Belgrade in Wednesday's Champions League match and thanked the fans for the support he had received since the incident at Goodison Park.</p>

      <p>"It has been a really tough few days," Son told BT Sport.</p>
      <p>"I have realised how lucky I am with all the support I have had from the fans and my team mates.</p>
      <p>"I can say I'm really sorry for the accident and the situation but I had to focus for the team and I had to keep going and it was the right response to all the people who have supported me."</p>
      <p>The South Korean was visibly upset after he tackled Gomes, who suffered a fracture dislocation to his right ankle.</p>
      <p>Son was sent off for the tackle but the red card was later overturned by the Football Association following an appeal by Tottenham.</p>
