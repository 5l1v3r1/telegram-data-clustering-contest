        <b>TOKYO (Sputnik) - A US F-16 fighter jet accidentally dropped a dummy bomb during a training flight in Japan's northern Aomori prefecture that was later found on private land outside the training grounds, the command of the US forces in Japan (USFJ) said on Thursday.</b>

      <blockquote>"While conducting training, an F-16 at Misawa [Air Base] released a device 5 kilometres [3 miles] from the Draughon range late Wednesday. The cause of the incident is still under investigation, and USFJ notified GOJ [Government of Japan] this morning in accordance with all agreements", the command said on Twitter.</blockquote>

      <p>Similar incidents involving US military aircraft stationed in Japan have happened in recent years. In particular, at least <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910281077164271-three-us-troops-arrested-in-japans-okinawa-for-damaging-local-police-cars---reports/">two helicopters made emergency landings in residential areas of Okinawa prefecture,</a> and a 10-year-old student suffered a minor injury after a helicopter window fell onto a local school.</p>

      <p>In a more serious incident, three servicemen were killed off the coast of Okinawa when a C2-A aircraft with 11 people on board crashed into the Pacific Ocean in November 2017. A month earlier, a CH-53 helicopter made an emergency landing on private property before bursting into flames.</p>
