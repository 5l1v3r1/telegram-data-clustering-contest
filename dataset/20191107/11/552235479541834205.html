      <h1>This Scottish town is set to be one of the most popular baby names of 2020</h1>
      <h2>It has become a popular girl's name, and is now in the top 10 most loved for next year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T11:07:06+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 11:07</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, Courtney Pochin, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>Choosing a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/babies">baby</a> name can be tricky at the best of times.</p>
      <p>There is so much to think about from possible nicknames to choosing a name that will stand the test of time.</p>
      <p>And it turns out a Scottish town is now one of the top baby names for 2020, according to Nameberry.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paisley">Paisley</a> has come in at number 4 in the most popular girl's name for next year.</p>
      <p>More and more parents are naming their <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/battling-baby-born-half-heart-14012614">babies</a> after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/renfrewshire">Renfrewshire town</a> and the reason may sound rather bizarre but, in 2019, it strangely makes sense.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>According to baby name consultant Sherri Suzanne, parents-to-be are now thinking about what will make their little ones stand out on social media when considering names, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/baby-name-consultant-reveals-bizarre-14055210">reports Mirror Online</a> .</p>
      <p>In order to create the top 20, the team at Nameberry work out which names in their database have seen the biggest increase in interest over the last year.</p>

      <p>And it seems that parents are really loving the name Paisley as well as old fashioned names like Pearl, which was a top 100 name from 1880 through the mid-1920s.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, other names to make the cut take inspiration from pop culture events or celebrities, like Reese (Reese Witherspoon) and Billie (Billie Eilish).</p>
      <p>Nameberry says: "Our top baby names are a radical departure from the official national list, which suffers from a considerable time lag. We won't know which names were really used the most often for babies in 2020 until May of 2021.</p>
      <p>"The names here offer baby namers a heads up on trends and specific names destined to get more popular in 2020 and beyond."</p>
