      <p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">Black Friday</a> is just a couple of weeks away and we're now starting to see ads from the big retailers like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/targets-black-friday-ad-doesnt-disappoint-19-smart-speakers-huge-gaming-bundles-and-more">Target</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/kohls-black-friday-ad-includes-big-discounts-and-ton-store-credit">Kohl's</a>. Even <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-announces-black-friday-pricing-echo-fire-tv-ring-products-more">Amazon</a> has given us a glimpse behind the curtain. The latest store to offer up details on its Black Friday promotion is <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82083YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fblack-friday%252Fsale-ad&amp;token=HxLhj8g0">Best Buy</a> with a huge ad covering all manner of products from tech and smart home to TVs and home entertainment, gaming, toys, kitchen appliances, and more.</p>
      <h3>Deals worth considering</h3>
      <p>Best Buy is one of the biggest names you're likely to think of when it comes to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">Black Friday</a> and its ad doesn't disappoint when it comes to major savings. Some of the deals we're seeing here are better than the competition and you can expect Best Buy to be matching prices from places like Amazon and Walmart during the event. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82083YYw%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fmisc%252Fmy-best-buy%252Fpcmcat309300050007.c&amp;token=qQ9przbe">My Best Buy</a> members will also receive some nice extra perks during the shopping event too.</p>

      <p>The Insignia line of Fire TV sets are already super affordable and highly-rated by those who have them, but this deal on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82083YYw%26subId2%3Dthrifter%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Finsignia-58-class-led-2160p-smart-4k-uhd-tv-with-hdr-fire-tv-edition%252F6355437.p%253FskuId%253D6355437%2526mnsid%253Dthrifter&amp;token=C7lQ1kgd">58-inch 4K model</a> blows any other deal we've seen before out of the water with a price drop to $199.99. On top of that $280 discount, you'll also get a free Amazon Echo Dot thrown in. These are usually $30-50 and will be $23 during Black Friday. Either way you look at it, it's a decent freebie. This TV is only available at Best Buy, so you know this is going to be the best price on it.</p>
      <h4>Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones</h4>

With $150 off their going rate <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B07KCDPWWD?mnsid=mbnx3-20&amp;tag=mbnx33-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82083YYw">at Amazon</a> and elsewhere, this is going to be a tough deal to beat (pun not intended). The deal applies to the gray, crystal blue, and desert sand colorways and is available from today.</p>

Not only do you get the doorbell at one of its best prices to date, you also get Amazon's Echo Show 5 (worth $80) and Ring Chime Pro (worth $50) thrown in at no extra cost.

      <h3>Deals worth ignoring</h3>
      <p>As with all Black Friday sales, some of the deals aren't really deals at all. Best Buy's ad is pretty great for the most part, but there are still a few duds in there with products that we have seen go lower or will be available elsewhere for less.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Amazon Echo Dot (will be cheaper directly at Amazon)</li>
        <li>Samsung Galaxy Active smartwatches</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Store information</h3>
      <h4>Get the latest Black Friday deals delivered straight to your inbox!</h4>
      <p>A number of Best Buy's deals have already begun, just look out for the "Black Friday price now" label and you know you're getting the best deal on it. Physical stores are set to open from 5pm on Thanksgiving before closing at 1am. Stores will then re-open on Black Friday at 8am and close at 10pm. There are several additional Doorbuster deals that will be made available from 8am on Black Friday itself. Supply will be limited for these items and tickets will be handed out to those waiting in line.</p>
      <p>Some deals will only be available to My Best Buy members, so you want ot <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F615614%2F10014%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU82083YYw%26subId2%3Dthrifter%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fsite%252Fmisc%252Fmy-best-buy%252Fpcmcat309300050007.c&amp;token=VuVx1_kK">sign up for free</a> before the event kicks off to ensure you see all of the deals.</p>
