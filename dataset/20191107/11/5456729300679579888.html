      <p>A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Thursday remanded a 39-year-old fake prophetess, Ogechi Okoli, who pleaded guilty to absconding with her client’s property.</p>
      <p>Ms Okoli, a resident of Area 1 by Dunamis Church, Abuja, was arraigned on a two-count charge of joint act and cheating, offences she admitted committing.</p>
      <p>The judge, Inuwa Maiwada, ordered that Ms Okoli be remanded in Keffi Prison until November 27, for sentencing.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the prosecutor, Ijeoma Ukagha, told the court that Ms Okoli committed the offence sometime in October at Area 1, Garki by Dunamis Church.</p>
      <p>Ms Ukagha said the defendant and one Mohammed (surname unknown) now at large, criminally deceived one Bukola Ayadele of Kpana village, Abuja.</p>

      <p>She said the defendant pretended to be a prophetess and criminally deceived the complainant and collected her cell phone valued at N22, 000, eyeglass, tracksuit, shirt and other valuable items.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said the defendant after praying for the complainant, directed her to count seven poles and that after that her problems would be solved.</p>
      <p>Ms Ukagha said the defendant also told the complainant to come back and collect her property, adding that, instead the prophetess absconded with the said property to an unknown destination.</p>
      <p>Ms Ukagha said the prophetess was later arrested on November 4 and brought to Utako Police Station, but she refused to disclose where she kept the property.</p>
      <p>“Right now the property in question is missing,’’ she told the court.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor, who said that the case was still under investigation, also said the offences contravened Sections 79 and 322 of the Penal Code.</p>
      <p>Ms Okoli, however, pleaded guilty to the charge and begged the court for leniency.</p>
      <p>“I am so sorry my lord for what I did. I will not do it again,’’</p>
      <p>“I engaged in this act because I don’t have job; please forgive me sir,’’ she pleaded.</p>
