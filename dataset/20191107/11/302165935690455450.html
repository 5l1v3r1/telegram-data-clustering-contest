      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 7 — <i>Baby Girl</i> will lead Pesci’s first album in 21 years, <i>Still Singing</i>, which is due on November 29.</p>
      <p>For his return to his jazz roots, Pesci dueted with Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine and legendary Cuban multi-instrumentalist Arturo Sandoval.</p>
      <p>“When I’m away from you, I know what to say and do/But every time you’re near, my courage disappear/Don’t know if I’ll get through being destroyed by you/While you’re collected and cool, I make a fool of myself,” he croons over Latin percussions before being joined by Levine.</p>
      <p>As Entertainment Weekly pointed out, <i>Baby Girl</i> is not the only song from <i>Still Singing</i> to which Levine contributed.</p>
      <p>The <i>Memories</i> vocalist will appear on a cover of the soul classic <i>My Cherie Amour</i>, which was originally performed by none other than Stevie Wonder.</p>
      <p>Pesci’s upcoming new album will also feature a posthumous contribution from late jazz vocalist Jimmy Scott on the 1938 standard <i>The Nearness Of You</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Still Singing</i> marks Pesci’s third studio effort, following his 1998 <i>Vincent LaGuardia Gambini Sings Just for You</i> based on his character from the comedy <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>.</p>
      <p>In addition to his comeback album, the former lounge singer will also star in Martin Scorsese’s upcoming crime film, <i>The Irishman</i>, which will arrive on Netflix on November 27.</p>
      <p>Pesci will notably portray the mobster Russell Bufalino alongside Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Ray Romano and more.</p>
