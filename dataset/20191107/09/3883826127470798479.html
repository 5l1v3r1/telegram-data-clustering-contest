        <b>Lufthansa has cancelled 1,300 flights after it lost a last-minute legal bid to halt a strike by cabin crew.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two-day action over pay and conditions began at midnight local time. About 180,000 passengers are set to face travel disruption.</p>
      <p>The UFO union said it would hit all Lufthansa flights from German airports.</p>
      <p>Flights by Lufthansa's other airlines including Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, and Brussels Airlines are not affected, the airline said.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa has cancelled 700 flights on Thursday and 600 on Friday, amounting to about one-fifth of its planned flights over the 48-hour period.</p>

      <p>It said it regretted the inconvenience caused, adding: "We will do everything we can to minimise the impact of this massive strike on our customers."</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, a Frankfurt labour court rejected Lufthansa's application to prevent the strike, which is part of a long-running dispute at the airline.</p>
      <p>Lufthansa has said passengers travelling between German airports can exchange their tickets online for rail tickets. Other passengers will be offered alternative flights.</p>
      <p>The union's vice-president, Daniel Flohr, has warned that further strikes could come "at any time".</p>
