      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is looking for a third country to send detained Cambodian opposition leader Mu Sochua to, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Malaysian immigration authorities detained Sochua after Cambodia sought her arrest on the grounds that she and other self-exiled opposition leaders were plotting a coup in trying to return home.</p>
      <p>“Our principle, in ASEAN in particular, generally is that we don’t interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,” Mahathir said referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</p>
      <p>“We do not want to let them to use Malaysia as a base for struggle in other countries. We wanted to deport her ... now we are trying to find any country that can take her.”</p>
