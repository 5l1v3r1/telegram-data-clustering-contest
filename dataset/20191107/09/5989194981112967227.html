      <p><i>Deckare</i> is the Swedish word for crime novels or other fiction; as you may have noticed, Swedish authors are fairly fond of these and the country has a strong tradition in detective fiction.</p>
      <p>Although it usually refers to books, a TV series or film can also be a <i>deckare</i>. A similar English word would be 'whodunnit'.</p>

      <p>The term comes from a shortening of <i>detektiv</i> (you probably don't need to be a 'detective' to work out that that's the English translation), since the protagonist in these stories is often a private detective. But books featuring a police officer, journalist, or a mystery-solver of another profession can also fall under this heading.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>One of the key defining features of the <i>deckare</i> is that the reader must have the same chance as the detective to solve the murder, meaning that all clues should be clear to readers as well as characters.</p>
      <p><i>Deckare</i> (the plural form is the same as the singular) have boomed in popularity over the past few decades, making up an increasingly large proportion of the bestseller lists in Sweden. </p>
