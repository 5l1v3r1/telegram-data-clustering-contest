      <p>BEIJING (Nov 7): China and the United States have agreed to cancel in phases the tariffs imposed during their months-long trade war, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday, without specifying a timetable.</p>
      <p>An interim U.S.-China trade deal is widely expected to include a U.S. pledge to scrap tariffs scheduled for Dec 15 on about US$156 billion worth of Chinese imports including cell phones, laptop computers and toys.</p>
      <p>Tariff cancellation was an important condition for any agreement, ministry spokesman Gao Feng said, adding that both must simultaneously cancel some tariffs on each other's goods to reach a "phase one" trade deal.</p>
      <p>"The trade war started with tariffs, and should end with the cancellation of tariffs," Gao told a regular news briefing.</p>
      <p>The proportion of tariffs cancelled for both sides to reach a "phase one" deal must be the same, but the number to be cancelled can be negotiated, he added, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>"In the past two weeks, the lead negotiators from both sides have had serious and constructive discussions on resolving various core concerns appropriately," Gao said.</p>
      <p>"Both sides have agreed to cancel additional tariffs in different phases, as both sides make progress in their negotiations."</p>
      <p>He did not give a timeline.</p>
      <p>A source previously told <i>Reuters</i> that Chinese negotiators wanted the United States to drop 15% tariffs on about US$125 billion worth of Chinese goods that took effect on Sept 1.</p>
      <p>They also sought relief from earlier 25% tariffs on about US$250 billion of imports, ranging from machinery and semiconductors to furniture.</p>
      <p>A person familiar with China's negotiating position said it was pressing Washington to "remove all tariffs as soon as possible".</p>
      <p>A deal may be signed this month by U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a yet-to-be determined location.</p>
      <p>Dozens of venues have been suggested for a meeting, which had originally been set to take place on the sidelines of a now-cancelled mid-November summit of Asia-Pacific leaders in Chile, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>One possible location was London, where the leaders could meet after a NATO summit that Trump is due to attend from Dec 3-4, the official said.</p>
      <p>Gao declined to say as to when and where such a meeting could be.</p>
      <p>Since Trump took office in 2017, his administration has been pressing China to curb massive subsidies to state-owned firms and end the forced transfer of American technology to Chinese firms, as a price of doing business in China.</p>
