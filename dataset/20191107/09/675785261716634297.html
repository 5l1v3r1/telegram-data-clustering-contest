      <h1>Amazon Prime Video is down: Site crashes leaving users unable to stream films</h1>
      <h2>BREAKING: The issues with Amazon Prime Video started at around 09:16 GMT, and are affecting users across the UK</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:30:43+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/shivalibestjournalist/</a></address>
      <p>It’s one of the most popular film and TV streaming services around, but it seems that Amazon Prime Video has crashed this morning.</p>
      <p>According to DownDetector the issues started at 09:16 GMT, and are affecting users across the UK.</p>
      <p>While the reason for the outage remains unclear, of those who reported issues, 85% said they were having problems streaming videos, 12% couldn’t log-in, and 2% were having problems with the website.</p>
      <p>We tested the app, and was met by a spinning wheel of the home page, and couldn’t access any downloaded content.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Amazon for comment.</p>
