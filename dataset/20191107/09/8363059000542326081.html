      <h1>Morrisons Goes Back for a Second Helping of the Vegan Pie With Meat Free Pork Pies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:30:21+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Hot on the heels of its <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/morrisons-footlong-vegan-sausage-roll/">footlong vegan sausage roll</a>, Morrisons unveils its vegan pork pie, available from December 9.</p>
      <p>The pie's recipe is apparently a closely guarded secret that was only known by six staff members. It supposedly tastes meaty, and is pretty close to the real thing, but that's coming from a vegan website, so who knows how accurate that is.</p>
      <p>"So many people across the UK are fond of eating a pork pie at Christmas," said Morrisons pie buyer, Steven Halford. "Our vegan and vegetarian customers previously couldn’t enjoy a pork pie but with our new meat free product they can enjoy a great tasting alternative."</p>
      <p>The pies will be rolling out at the supermarket's pie shop counters from December 9, priced at £1.75, or - if you think they'll be so tasty you'll be coming back for more - two for £3.</p>
      <p>Now all we need is for Morrisons to launch a whole vegan turkey and we'll be set for Christmas.</p>
