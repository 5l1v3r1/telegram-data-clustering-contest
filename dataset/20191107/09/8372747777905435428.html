      <p>PHILADELPHIA, Pa. â€“ A 10-year-old boy walking home from school in Philadelphia was critically injured Wednesday when he was shot in the back of the head by a stray bullet, according to police.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia police said a man involved in the shooting has been arrested, but the gunman remains on the loose, <a href="https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/11/06/philadelphia-shooting-man-custody-connection-semaj-obranty-walking-home-school-frankford/">CNN affiliate KYW reported.</a></p>
      <p>Authorities said Semaj O'Branty was not the intended target, KYW<b> </b>reported. He was walking home from school in Frankford around 3:30 p.m. when police say a man driving a red Pontiac G6 fired at the man in custody, who tried to shield the boy and fired back, the station reported.</p>
      <p>"He tries to cover the kid and protect the kid, but the kid takes a shot," Philadelphia Police Capt. John Walker said, according to the station.</p>
      <p>The shooting comes just weeks after <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/us/philadelphia-shootings-children/index.html">a 2-year-old girl was killed </a>and an 11-month old critically wounded in two separate shootings. So far this year, there have been more than 300 homicide victims in Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/crime-maps-stats/">according to statistics by Philadelphia police</a> . It's the highest number since 2007.</p>
      <p>CNN has reached out to the Philadelphia Police Department.</p>
      <p>"I heard about anywhere from 11 to 13 shots, right in a row," Harry Stork told the station. "Next thing I knew, there was a lady down the street holding the boy's back of his head and they rushed him off to the hospital."</p>
      <p>Semaj was transported to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children. He<b> </b>is currently in critical condition, but doctors say he is stable and expected to survive, the station reported.</p>
