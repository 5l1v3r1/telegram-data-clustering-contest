      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:55:25+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/361401-just-in-maina-arrives-court-in-a-wheelchair.html" target="_blank">Halimah Yahaya</a></address>
      <p>The former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, Thursday, appeared in a wheelchair for his trial at the Federal High Court in Abuja.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES had reported how Mr Maina’s trial was stalled on Tuesday due to his reported ill health. A prosecutor had questioned the health report brought to the hospital to announce Mr Maina’s ill health.</p>
      <p>Mr Maina, who was in hiding for almost two years, was eventually arrested by the State Security Service (SSS) which had hitherto been accused of shielding him from arrest.</p>
      <p>The SSS then handed over Mr Maina to the anti-graft agency, EFCC, which had declared him wanted for over a year.</p>
      <p>Mr Maina was arraigned on October 25 and pleaded not guilty to the 12-count charge of N100 billion pension fraud brought against him.</p>
      <p>He is being prosecuted by the EFCC on a 12-count charge bordering on money laundering, operating fictitious accounts and other fraudulent activities.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Mr Maina was wheeled into the courtroom by two prison wardens.</p>
      <p>The court is to rule on his bail application today.</p>
