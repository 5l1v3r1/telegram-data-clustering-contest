      <p>The Police Command in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Wednesday said it arrested 42 suspects over rape, kidnapping and other criminal activities in the territory.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner of Police in charge of the Command, Bala Ciroma, disclosed this at a news conference in Abuja.</p>

      <p>He said that the police operatives attached to Gwagwalada Area Command on October 28 arrested one Juri Abubakar, 30, a member of a kidnap syndicate, at Yangoji area of the FCT following a tip off.</p>
      <p>Mr Ciroma said the suspect had admitted to supplying food to other members of the syndicate who had threatened to kidnap a victim but were foiled by the ‘prompt’ intervention of the police.</p>
      <p>He said the suspect was arrested before the execution of the act, adding that efforts were being made to arrest five other members of the syndicate.</p>
