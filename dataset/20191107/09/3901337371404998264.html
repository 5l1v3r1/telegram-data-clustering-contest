      <p>The Frenchman struck twice in Los Blancos' drubbing of Galatasaray at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night, bringing up his eighth and ninth goals, in all competitions, of the 2019/20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Benzema's first goal also ensured that he has now scored in 15 consecutive Champions League seasons, a run only Messi has previously achieved.</p>
