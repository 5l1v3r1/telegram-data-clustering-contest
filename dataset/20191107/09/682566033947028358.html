      <p>Johannesburg - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> legend <b>Neil Tovey</b> says a club-versus-country tug of war over the team that will compete in an <b>Olympic Games</b> qualifying tournament from this weekend is a "disgrace".</p>
      <p>Egypt will host the November 8-22 competition for under-23 footballers in Cairo that also involves South Africa, Cameroon, Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mali, Nigeria and Zambia.</p>
      <p>The top three finishers qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics Games, hoping to emulate gold medallists Nigeria (1996) and Cameroon (2000).</p>
      <p>Each country is permitted a 21-man squad, but when the South Africans arrived in Cairo this week they had just 12 players.</p>
      <p>A FIFA international window spans November 11 to 19 and top-flight clubs in South Africa are refusing to release outside of those dates any players chosen for Egypt.</p>
      <p>"It is a disgrace. It is downright diabolical that they cannot have the best players," said Tovey, who captained South Africa to the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations title.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old is the South African Football Association (SAFA) technical director.</p>
      <p>"This is a sad state of affairs - begging clubs for players. The squad was changed six or seven times in 10 days before the final announcement.</p>
      <p>"It has been an absolute nightmare for weeks, trying to put it together. Clubs must stop being selfish in their approach."</p>
      <p>South Africa is one of a few African countries where football is not controlled exclusively by the national association.</p>
      <p>There is a separate body that governs top-level club football and flexes its muscles occasionally by clashing with SAFA over issues that include player availability.</p>
      <p>South Africa are in Group B with Nigeria, the Ivory Coast and Zambia and unless the clubs relent, will have a full squad only for the second match against the Ivorians.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Highly-rated Zambia</b>
      </p>
      <p>By then they could be in a win-or-bust situation as their first match this Saturday is against highly-rated Zambia, many of whose players won the 2017 African youth championship.</p>
      <p>Consistent Zambian scorer Fashion Sakala plays for Oostende in Belgium and his teammates include Red Bull Salzburg pair Patson Daka and Enock Mwepu.</p>
      <p>Nigeria must do without Samuel Chukwueze of Villarreal and Victor Osimhen of Lille, who have been called up by the senior side for Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.</p>
      <p>But former Arsenal midfielder Kelechi Nwakali, now with Spanish second-tier side Huesca, says "we will hold our own provided we combine our talents for the betterment of the team".</p>
      <p>He lauded Turkey-based captain and midfielder Azubuike Okechukwu, saying his "courage and commitment are great examples to the rest of us".</p>
      <p>Egypt have had trouble-free preparations under former senior national coach Shawky Gharib for Group A matches against Mali, Cameroon and Ghana, winning six warm-up games and drawing one.</p>
      <p>After the senior side flopped as 2019 Cup of Nations hosts, suffering a shock last-16 loss to South Africa, there is huge pressure on the Olympics squad to atone by qualifying for Japan.</p>
      <p>"This is the best Olympics squad Egypt has ever had," boasts Gharib. "All the players feature regularly in the domestic league and are experienced."</p>
      <p>Cameroon have also been tug of war victims, but not to the same extent as South Africa. French Ligue 1 outfit Nice refused to release forward Ignatius Ganago.</p>
