      <p>Sarah Kavanagh, a Dundalk businesswoman who has lived in England for the past 20 years, recently won a gold medal at the England Masters Weightlifting Grand Prix held in Milton Keynes recently.  </p>

      <p>Sarah is a daughter of Margaret and Peter Kavanagh, St. Alphonsus Road, and wife of David Studd, Yorkshire, and presently lives in Wickersley near Rotherham.</p>
      <p>She was a pupil of Realt na Mara Primary and St. Vincent's Secondary Schools, holds a degree in Equine Science and Marketing from Thomond College, Limerick and a British business design diploma.</p>
