      <p>The Embassy of Italy and the Italian Cultural Institute <i>(Istituto Italiano di Cultura),</i> in collaboration with Aula Simfonia Jakarta, is hosting <i>The Luciano Pavarotti Foundation &amp; Anggun in Concert</i> on Saturday. The concert is part of a series of events to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between Italy and Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The late Luciano Pavarotti (1935-2007) was an Italian operatic tenor who, due to his crossover into popular music, became one of the most renowned and commercially successful tenors of all time. This concert will revisit the Maestro’s philosophy, which melds together modern and operatic classical music, that will be performed by the artists of The Pavarotti Foundation.</p>
      <p>The show’s highlight will be the virtual duet between Indonesian-born French singer Anggun C. Sasmi and Pavarotti, a repeat of the performance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLcixfnk8Ew">finale of </a><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLcixfnk8Ew">Asia’s Got Talent</a> </i>in April this year.</p>
