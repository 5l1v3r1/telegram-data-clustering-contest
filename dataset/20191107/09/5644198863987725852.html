      <p>SANTIAGO: Chile's president said Wednesday (Nov 6) his government had "nothing to hide" concerning allegations that police killed, tortured and sexually assaulted civilians during deadly protests against him.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say five of the 20 deaths recorded in the protests against high living costs were suspected to have been at the hands of security forces.</p>

      <p>"We have been totally transparent about the figures because we have nothing to hide," President Sebastian Pinera said in a speech on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Clashes between protesters and police have turned parts of the capital Santiago into a battleground over recent nights.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, protesters called on demonstrators to expand their rallies to rich districts so far untouched by the wave of demonstrations, centering on a major shopping center.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RIOTING GOES UPMARKET</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hundreds of students poured into the district, looting a pharmacy and two banks and clashing with riot police as traffic ground to a halt.</p>
      <p>The Costanera Center is South America's biggest shopping center and a symbol of the economic expansion that had made Chile one the region's most stable countries until the latest unrest.</p>
      <p>Riot police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse protesters concentrating in various areas around the mall.</p>
      <p>"We are living a level of violence and destruction never seen before in the commune," said the mayor of the upmarket Providencia district, Evelyn Matthei.</p>
      <p>Other messages on social media called on protesters to rally in the upmarket Vitacura district at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>"The time has come to get to the east," said one message, indicating the upscale areas of the capital.</p>
      <p>"People are rather sad and scared about how the country can return to normalcy," said Andrea Ortega, a 43-year-old lawyer who left her office early to look after her children, fearing rioting in a district which has hitherto been left unscathed by the violence.</p>
      <p>Thousands of protesters also gathered at the city's Plaza Italia, the epicenter of the protests over the past three weeks.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, riot officers firing shot pellets injured two students among a group trying to overrun a public high school in Santiago, police said. The students were treated at a hospital and released.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SHOWPIECE SUMMITS CANCELLED</b>
      </p>
      <p>The crisis has forced the government to cancel separate international economic and climate summits as well as a major international football match, the Copa Libertadores final.</p>
      <p>A UN human rights mission is investigating allegations of police brutality during the unrest.</p>
      <p>The Washington-based Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on Wednesday also asked Pinera's authorization to send a mission to Chile at the request of human rights groups.</p>
      <p>Chile's independent National Human Rights Institute says it has brought legal action over 181 cases including alleged murders, sexual violence and torture by the military police.</p>
      <p>Pinera said state agents who committed abuses would be punished just as severely as those who carried out vandalism or violence in the protests.</p>
      <p>He has reshuffled his government and announced a series of measures aimed at placating the protesters.</p>
      <p>In the latest of these, on Wednesday he signed a law guaranteeing a minimum monthly wage of about US$467.</p>
      <p>But protesters have continued demanding that the right-wing billionaire president step down.</p>
      <p>Pinera said in a BBC interview broadcast Tuesday that he would not resign over the protests.</p>
