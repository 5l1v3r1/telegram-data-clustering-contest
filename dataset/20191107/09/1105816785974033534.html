      <h1>Airbnb to verify listings as deadly incident prompts safety move</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:33:24+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">https://tribune.com.pk/author/8807/sana-khantribune-com-pk/, Tribune.com.pk</a></address>
      <p>Airbnb said Wednesday it would verify all seven million of its listings worldwide after a deadly shooting at one of its California homes fueled fresh safety concerns about the lodging platform.</p>
      <p>Chief executive and co-founder Brian Chesky said the home-sharing service decided on new steps as part of an effort to instill more trust in Airbnb.</p>
      <p>“By December 15, 2020, every home and every host on Airbnb will be reviewed with the objective of 100% verification,” he said in an email to employees.</p>
      <p>“We believe that trust on the internet begins with verifying the accuracy of the information on Internet platforms, and we believe that this is an important step for our industry.”</p>
      <p>He said that addresses, photos and other details on Airbnb listings will be verified for accuracy and that “those that meet our high expectations will be clearly labeled.”</p>
      <p>The move is aimed at weeding out what Chesky called “bad actors,” and referenced the case of a so-called “party house” in Orinda, California.</p>
      <p>Five people were killed and others wounded in a Thursday night shooting at the residence, which had been rented on the platform.</p>
      <p>More than 100 people were present at the event, which was announced on social media.</p>
      <p>“We are not infallible,” Chesky said in a Twitter message.</p>
      <p>“We are a platform built on a foundation of trust. We need to continue innovating on trust to make it harder for the bad actors. The trust of our community is our top priority.”</p>
      <p>He said the platform would set up a staffed 24/7 “neighbor hotline” where anyone could call for safety concerns, and had asked for consulting from two former police chiefs — Charles Ramsey, who headed departments in Philadelphia and Washington DC, and Ronald Davis, who was head of the police in East Palo Alto.</p>

      <p>He said that starting next month, Airbnb would rebook customers or issue refunds “if upon checking into a listing it does not meet our accuracy standards.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Most hosts do a great job, but guests need to feel like Airbnb has their back, and we believe this commitment is a necessary step in giving guests peace of mind.”</p>
      <p>To address unauthorised house parties, Chesky said Airbnb would expand “manual screening of high-risk reservations flagged by our risk detection models” to North America and globally.</p>
      <p>The move comes a week after Vice News reported what it called a scam using a loophole in the Airbnb system to trick customers into changing their reservation to a non-existent listing.</p>
      <p>The report said the Vice journalist accidentally uncovered a scheme affecting at least eight cities and nearly 100 property listings.</p>
      <p>Airbnb, one of the largest of the “sharing economy” platforms with operations in some 190 countries, has said it would go public in 2020 with a valuation estimated as high as $35 billion.</p>
      <p>The service has had a major impact on the travel sector and prompted regulatory moves in a number of jurisdictions over taxes and other regulatory issues.</p>

      <p>The company has suffered a major defeat in Jersey City which voted overwhelmingly to clamp down on the home-sharing company’s activities in the New York City suburb.</p>
      <p>Around 70% of voters in the city of 270,000 — which is separated from Manhattan by the Hudson River — favored severe restrictions on locations that offer short-term stays, according to results released Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The rules, approved earlier this year by the Jersey City council, established permitting requirements for short-term rentals and mandates that a proprietor must be present if someone rents for longer stays.</p>
      <p>Airbnb had sought the referendum as a challenge to the rules, spending millions of dollars on advertising.</p>
