      <h1>Ceilings collapse in East Java elementary school, 1 teacher and 1 student killed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T09:28:10+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 09:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>One teacher and an eight-year-old student were killed after several ceilings collapsed in an elementary school in Pasuruan, East Java on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday morning, the ceilings in four classrooms suddenly caved in while dozens of students were inside. </p>
      <p>A 19-year-old substitute teacher named Fina Choironi and an eight-year-old student, identified by the initials IA, succumbed to the injuries they sustained in the incident. Eleven others — most of whom were students — were injured and then treated at a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>It’s not yet clear what caused the ceilings to collapse, but authorities pointed out that the incident happened during a clear and sunny morning with no extreme weather conditions observed.</p>
      <p>Police say they suspect that the ceilings collapsed due to poor construction standards.</p>
      <p>“We saw that the foundations of the building are not up to specification. [The ceiling] was constructed in 2017, so it’s only been two years and they have already collapsed,” Pasuruan Police Chief Agus Sudaryatno said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liputan6.com/news/read/4104744/headline-atap-sd-ambruk-tewaskan-guru-dan-murid-di-pasuruan-korupsi-atau-human-error">As noted by <i>Liputan 6</i></a>, in 2017, the central government allocated IDR419.8 trillion (US$30 billion) towards education, which was a 13.3 percent increase from the previous year. </p>
      <p>Speaking about the incident, President Joko Widodo implied that the ceilings collapse may have been the result of officials misappropriating funds.</p>
      <p>“The quality [of construction] will suffer, bridges collapse, schools collapse, these are because they rush the construction,” he said yesterday.</p>
      <p>Jokowi also called on officials to spend the 2020 education budget, which has been set at IDR508 trillion, efficiently.</p>
