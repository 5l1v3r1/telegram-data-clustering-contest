      <h1>AT&amp;T Switches Customers To More Expensive Plans Without Asking Them First</h1>

      <p>AT&amp;T is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/att-adds-10-to-smartphone-bills-for-customers-with-older-plans/">adding $10 to the monthly bills of customers with certain grandfathered mobile-data plans</a> and not letting them switch back to their older packages. AT&amp;T is pitching the change as a "bonus" because it's also adding 15GB to the customers' monthly data allotments. Ars Technica reports: <i>"Enjoy more data," AT&amp;T says in a <a href="https://www.att.com/esupport/article.html?cjevent=2018c0f501bc11ea8235009d0a1c0e0f&amp;source=EC1NAT10600aff12A#!/wireless/KM1356113">support document</a>. "Starting with your October 2019 bill, you'll get an additional 15GB of data on your Mobile Share plan. This bonus data comes with a $10 price increase." Paying an extra $10 for another 15GB isn't a bad deal as far as U.S. wireless prices go, but that's only true if you actually need the extra data. The plans getting the data-and-price increases already had between 20GB and 60GB of data per month at prices that ranged from $100 to $225. Now those plans have 35GB to 75GB and cost $110 to $235. (The data allotments can be shared among multiple people on the same family plan.) <br/><br/>These Mobile Share Value plans were <a href="https://about.att.com/newsroom/introducing_our_mobile_share_value_plans_dec.html">introduced in December 2013</a> and are apparently no longer offered to new customers. This is at least the second time this year that AT&amp;T has added $10 and extra data to customer bills; a previous increase took effect between March and May and mostly affected a different set of Mobile Share Value plans, according to another AT&amp;T support document. AT&amp;T confirmed that there's no way to opt out of the new $10 increase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952512/att-price-hike-cellular-mobile-share-value-plan">The Verge reported yesterday</a>.</i></p>
