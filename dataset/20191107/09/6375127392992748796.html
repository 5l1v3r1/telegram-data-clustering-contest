      <h3>LUCENA CITY— Once again, the top honcho of Calabarzon police force warned eering policemen to shape up or ship out in order not to face the bloody consequences of their illegal activities.</h3>
      <p>“Para sa mga tiwaling pulis, muli kong sinasabi sa inyo na magbago na kayo at kung di n’yo kayang magbago ay umalis na kayo sa serbisyo at iwan n’yo ang inyong mga baril at tsapa”, said Calabarzon police director Brig. Gen. Vicente Danao, Jr. during a command visit to the headquarters of Quezon Police Provincial Office under Col. Audie Madrideo.</p>
      <p>Danao, a rumored future Philippine National Police chief due to his close ties with President Rodrigo Duterte told Quezon cops to do their job properly and avoid getting themselves involved in illegal activities particularly in illegal drugs “in order for you to keep your bodies and souls together”.</p>
      <p>“If you have already benefited from illegal activities and were able to get away with it, please do not do it under my watch. Dahil pag natiyempuhan ko kayo, ako mismo ang gigilit sa mga leeg n’yo”, Danao said with emphasis.</p>
