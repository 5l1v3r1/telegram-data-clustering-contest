      <h1>After Google's Fitbit deal, Europe's antitrust chief fears for data privacy</h1>
      <h2>Google's Fitbit deal requires EU regulatory approval</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:56:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The acquisition of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>for their data is concerning in general for regulators, Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said on Thursday, a week after <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>bought fitness trackers company <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fitbit">Fitbit </a>.</p>
      <p>Alphabet Inc-owned <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>paid $2.1 billion (Â£1.6 billion) for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fitbit">Fitbit </a>to help it take on Apple and Samsung Electronics in the crowded market for fitness trackers and smart watches.</p>
      <p>Vestager declined to comment on the deal specifically but said there was general unease among regulators when data-heavy <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>are the targets of bids.</p>
      <p>Google's deal has triggered calls from competitors to competition enforcers to take a tough line. Fitbit, which helped pioneer the wearable devices craze, has an invaluable trove of health data.</p>
      <p>"In general we have a concern if <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>merge because of data," Vestager told a news briefing at Web Summit.</p>
      <p>She added that regulators then considered the questions of, does this create a barrier to entry, will this make it more difficult to innovate and does a risk to privacy issues arise from that kind of data coming together.</p>
      <p>Google's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/fitbit">Fitbit </a>deal requires EU regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>Vestager has in the last two years handed down more than 8 billion euros in fines to <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>for stifling competitors in three separate cases involving its price comparison shopping product, its Android smartphone operating system and in search advertising brokering.</p>
