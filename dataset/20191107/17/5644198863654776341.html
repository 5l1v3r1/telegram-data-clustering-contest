      <p>The court heard that the man was at Bukit Panjang MRT Station on the evening of Feb 1 this year.</p>
      <p>At about 7.20pm, he took an escalator up from the station to the street level, and was three steps behind the 17-year-old victim.</p>
      <p>The girl was with her boyfriend at the time, and Tan saw both of them together.</p>
      <p>He then "got curious about the colour and design of the victim's underwear", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Regina Lim.</p>
      <p>He turned on the camera mode of his phone and began walking up the right side of the escalator, passing the couple on his left.</p>
      <p>As he did so, he placed the phone under the victim's skirt, taking six photos.</p>
      <p>The girl's boyfriend saw Tan and suspected that he had taken photos of his girlfriend. He went after Tan and saw that the phone was in camera mode.</p>
      <p>He caught up with Tan at the end of the escalator, took the phone from him and called 999.</p>
      <p>The police arrived shortly after, seized the phone and found six upskirt photos.</p>
      <p>Tan had also taken such pictures of another victim at Toa Payoh MRT station earlier that day.</p>
      <p>For intruding on a woman's privacy to insult her modesty, Tan could have been jailed for up to a year, fined, or both.</p>
      <p>His phone was forfeited to the police for disposal.</p>
