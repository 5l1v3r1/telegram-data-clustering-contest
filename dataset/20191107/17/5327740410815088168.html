      <p>One of two new drug-sniffing dogs at Vancouver General Hospital now has a name, picked by the public in a recent contest.</p>
      <p>Four-month-old Finn earned his name, which was inspired by Huckleberry Finn, from 900 votes cast online last month in a <a href="https://www.surreynowleader.com/news/two-new-pups-join-vancouver-hospitals-superbug-sniffing-squad/">naming contest</a> hosted by the Vancouver General Hospital Foundation. k9 Handler Teresa Zurberg said the name was fitting for the playful and adventerous dog.</p>
      <p>“He is a clever guy,” Zurberg said of the English springer spaniel. Finn will now undergo months of training to detect a superbug which attacks people with weakened immune systems called clostridium difficile, also known as C. difficile, in the hospital.</p>
      <p>Finn and his sister, named Traveller, will be trained by the C. Difficile Canine Scent Detection Program’s top dogs, Angus and Dodger.</p>
      <p>The program was launched in 2016, and since then the canine scent detection team has searched hundreds of hospital areas foe the superbug.</p>
