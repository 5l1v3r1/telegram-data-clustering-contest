      <h3>STOKE have made an official approach for Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill, the Irish Football Association has announced.</h3>
      <p>The Potters have been linked with a host of potential replacements since sacking Nathan Jones last week and have now contacted the IFA about their long-serving boss.</p>
      <p>In a short statement released to the PA news agency, the IFA said: "The Irish Football Association has been approached by EFL Championship club Stoke City who are seeking permission to speak to Michael O'Neill about their vacant manager's position."</p>
      <p>O'Neill, who was appointed in December 2011, guided Northern Ireland to their first major tournament in 30 years when qualifying for Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>They still have a chance of reaching next year's tournament too, sitting third in Group C behind Holland and Germany and face the daunting prospect of games against both powerhouses this month.</p>
      <p>Regardless of those results, a play-off place seems likely for Northern Ireland, which will surely factor into the 50-year-old's thinking as he ponders the prospect of taking over the Championship strugglers.</p>

      <p>Speaking at Wednesday's squad announcement in Belfast, O'Neill was asked about potential interest from Stoke.</p>
      <p>"It is always flattering. It is better to be linked than not linked, let's be honest," said O'Neill, who turned was unsuccessfully targeted by Scotland last year.</p>
      <p>"It it is not a distraction for me. It is something that has been ongoing for a number of years, and the focus has been on preparing for next week's games.</p>
      <p>"As I have always said, if and when a situation arises, then you look at that scenario at that moment in time. But right now, my focus is obviously on the two games that lie ahead."</p>
