      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Spike Lee will receive Film at Lincoln Center's 46th Chaplin Award.</p>
      <p>Lincoln Center announced Thursday that the 62-year-old filmmaker will be honored in its annual fundraising gala on April 27.</p>
      <p>For its 50th anniversary last year, Lincoln Center skipped a Chaplin Award honoree and instead hosted a special gala that featured Martin Scorsese, Pedro Almodovar, Tilda Swinton and others.</p>
      <p>The four previous Chaplin Award winners were Helen Mirren, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman and Robert Redford.</p>
      <p>A selected retrospective of Lee's films will also play alongside the event. Lee's last film, "BlacKkKlasman" was nominated for six Oscars including best picture.</p>
