      <p>Col Erlangga said two people sustained serious injuries. One suffered a fractured right foot while the other sustained a fracture to the rib, according to a hospital employee.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Singapore is aware of the incident, saying that officers from the Consulate-General in Batam are at the hospital to offer their assistance.</p>
