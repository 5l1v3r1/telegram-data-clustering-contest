      <p>The Frenchman got tongues wagging earlier in the week when he told members of the media that Mbappe's dream had always been to play for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>PSG's sporting director Leonardo has since hit back at the manager, warning him to stop talking about a player who is contracted to Les Parisiens.</p>

      <p>"Honestly, it bothers a little, it bothers," Leonardo told <i>RMC Sport</i>.</p>
      <p>"It is not the time to talk about dreams and all that. Stop. Mbappe is very important for us and it is not time to destabilise it.</p>
      <p>"He is the best young French player, world champion, one of the best in the world.</p>
      <p>"This is not the time to touch and destabilise him. It is time to stop. He has two and a half years of contract with us."</p>
