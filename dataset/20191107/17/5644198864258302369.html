      <p>TOKYO: More than 60 endangered turtles have disappeared from a zoo in Japan's southernmost province in a suspected theft, officials said Thursday (Nov 7).</p>
      <p>"We feed them twice a week and a keeper noticed their number was clearly low," said Kozue Ohgimi, zoo section chief at Okinawa Zoo and Museum, told AFP.</p>

      <p>Officials later found cable ties used to secure netting over the enclosure housing the turtles had been removed at several spots.</p>
      <p>"The nets were loose enough to enable an adult to sneak into the area," Ohgimi told AFP on the phone.</p>
      <p>Officials fear the turtles may have been stolen for sale on the black market, where they are valued as exotic pets.</p>
      <p>"They are traded for high prices," Ohgimi said.</p>
      <p>The disappearances have been reported to local police, who are investigating, zoo officials said.</p>
      <p>The turtles are small, measuring about a maximum 20cm long.</p>
      <p>In all, the zoo said 64 turtles have disappeared - 15 Ryukyu leaf turtles and 49 yellow-margined box turtles.</p>
