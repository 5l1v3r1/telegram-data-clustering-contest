      <p>London -Â Leicester City midfielder<b> James Maddison</b> was included Thursday in <b>Gareth Southgate's </b>squad for their <b>Euro 2020</b> qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo despite his controversial casino visit during the last international break.</p>
      <p>England host Montenegro on November 14 and play Kosovo in Pristina three days later.</p>
      <p>A point at Wembley against Montenegro in the 1,000th international match for the men's team would be enough to guarantee qualification.</p>
      <p>Maddison pulled out of the squad to face the Czech Republic and Bulgaria last month because of illness but the uncapped 22-year-old was pictured in a casino during the 2-1 defeat in Prague.</p>
      <p>Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers defended his player while Southgate said Maddison would have learned there was an increased spotlight on him.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a great decision he took (going to a casino). Now he will realise as an England player there is a different profile," said Southgate.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has a camera phone and has a chance to make some money. We're supporting him because we've picked him. He's got to come into the squad and fight for his place like anyone else."</p>
      <p>John Stones has returned, replacing the axed Michael Keane, and could make his first England appearance since the Nations League in June.</p>
      <p>Southgate is eager to see how the Manchester City defender performs in Sunday's top-of-the-table clash at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He said: "John's had a few games back in the team. I'll be able to answer that question (how impressed Southgate has been) better after Sunday. Matches up to now have been Manchester City dominated.</p>
      <p>"There's still a bit to see and a bit more to test him but it's good he's back fit and playing."</p>
      <p>Tottenham's Dele Alli misses out, with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain recalled after missing last month's squad as he continued to recover from a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool midfielder has scored four goals in his past four games.</p>
      <p>Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi, who has two caps, is promoted back from the under-21 squad following his return from the Achilles injury he suffered at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>Stamford Bridge teammate Mason Mount is also included despite coming off in Tuesday's 4-4 Champions League draw against Ajax with an ankle problem.</p>
      <p>There was also no place for Aston Villa's in-form captain Jack Grealish or Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Squad in full:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Goalkeepers:</b> Tom Heaton (Aston Villa), Jordan Pickford (Everton), Nick Pope (Burnley)</p>
      <p><b>Defenders:</b> Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez (both Liverpool), Ben Chilwell (Leicester), Harry Maguire (Manchester United), Tyrone Mings (Aston Villa), Danny Rose (Tottenham), John Stones (Manchester City), Fikayo Tomori (Chelsea), Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid/ESP)</p>
