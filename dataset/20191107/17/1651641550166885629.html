        <b>From November 6th until November 13th, The Elder Scrolls Online has shed its price tag and is free for all players on all platforms.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For those looking to explore Tamriel in Bethesda’s iconic MMO, your time is now. Simply hop onto your platform of choice, whether it’s PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, or Mac, and download and play the ESO base game for absolutely free.</p>
      <p>During the free week, you can create a character in one of four of the game’s classes – you can choose from Nightblade, Templar, Dragonknight, and Sorcerer – and explore 23 unique zones, as well as taking on the game’s main questline, the Mages and Fighters Guild storylines, and much more.</p>
      <p>Free players will also get access to the Morrowind zone and its corresponding story, letting you explore the home of the Dark Elves.</p>
