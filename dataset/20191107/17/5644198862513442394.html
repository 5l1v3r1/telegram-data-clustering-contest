      <p>BEIRUT:Â Thousands of students took to the streets across Lebanon Thursday (Nov 7) to demand a better future as an unprecedented anti-government protest movement entered its fourth week and continued to spread.</p>
      <p>Waving Lebanese flags, students and high school pupils massed in front of the education ministry in Beirut to voice their grievances against a political class seen as corrupt and incompetent.</p>

      <p>"I challenge any politician or official to send their children to state schools," one pupil told a local television channel.</p>
      <p>"The economy is in trouble, there is no work, how will we survive in the future?."</p>
      <p>Groups of students gathered elsewhere in Beirut and in other cities, the latest boost to a mobilisation that has been relentless since the protests erupted on Oct 17.</p>
      <p>Students in the coastal towns of Jounieh and Chekka gathered in front of the gates of the national telecommunications operator to block access, the state-run National News Agency reported.</p>
      <p>The rallies have created a rare moment of national unity in a country often characterised by its divisions.</p>
      <p>People of all ages and sects have gathered daily to demand better services, a crackdown on corruption and the wholesale removal of an elite they say has been ruling Lebanon like a cartel for decades.</p>
      <p>What started as a spontaneous, apolitical and leaderless popular movement, is becoming increasingly organised, with activists coming together to synchronise marches and stunts across the country.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators blocked employees from clocking in for work at the electricity utility's headquarters in Beirut Thursday, in protest at the abysmal quality of the mains electricity supply.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Saad Hariri bowed to pressure from the street late last month and submitted his government's resignation but the protest movement did not relent.</p>
      <p>Demonstrators want other key officials to step down to make way way for a technocratic cabinet not aligned with Lebanon's traditional sectarian-based parties.</p>
