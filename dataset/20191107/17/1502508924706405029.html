      <p>An interim <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/us-china-trade-deal">US-China trade deal </a>that rolls back some <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tariffs">tariffs </a>has the potential to improve the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Monetary Fund's baseline economic forecasts, which show the two countries' trade war slowing global growth significantly this year, an IMF spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Gerry Rice, the IMF's chief spokesman, told a regular news briefing that the fund welcomes any development that reduces trade tensions between the world's two largest economies and rolls back tariffs, particularly if it's part of a durable agreement.</p>
      <p>"We see it has holding potential to improve our baseline forecast," Rice said of an agreement to roll back <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tariffs">tariffs.</a> "But again we need to wait for the details."</p>
      <p>China's commerce ministry said the countries have agreed to cancel <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/tariffs">tariffs </a>in phases.</p>
