      <p>Pop star Lizzo has said her anxiety “sometimes fuels” who she is as a performer and artist.</p>
      <p>The American singer and rapper, known for hits Truth Hurts and Juice, is famed for her exuberant, energetic live performances.</p>
      <p>She told British Vogue: “When I get really, really anxious before a show, I just go harder and harder and harder when I’m performing and I just go crazy.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know why, but my anxiety sometimes fuels who I am as a performer and who I am as an artist – and I know that is not the case for everyone.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if my body just, like, out of a desperate need to find a place for my anxiety or find a use for it, takes it and puts it there.”</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old music star added: “I think if I was 21 right now, I would not be able to maintain this lifestyle without having major anxiety and panic attacks.</p>
      <p>“But thank God, my journey is all about self-care and finding that love for yourself and nurturing yourself. Because that’s what artists need more than anything.”</p>
      <p>Detroit-born Lizzo, whose real name is Melissa Jefferson, has enjoyed a stellar year following the April release of her third studio album, Cuz I Love You, and she performed at Glastonbury Festival this summer.</p>

      <p>She is also an actress and appeared in the drama Hustlers alongside Constance Wu and Jennifer Lopez, and she is a prominent body positivity activist on social media.</p>
      <p>Talking about the lack of body representation in the media, Lizzo told the magazine: “I would watch things on television and I would look at magazines and I would not see myself.</p>
      <p>“When you don’t see yourself, you start to think something’s wrong with you.</p>
      <p>“Then you want to look like those things and when you realise it’s a physical impossibility, you start to think, ‘What the f*** is wrong with me?’ I think that took a greater toll on me, psychologically, growing up than what anyone could have said to me.”</p>
      <p>British Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, said: “It brings me great joy to share with you the second of British Vogue’s December covers: the talented and beautiful musician Lizzo.</p>
      <p>“This month marks the two-year anniversary since my first issue of British Vogue, so it is very special to me. Seeing such a positive force for good on our cover in all her glory makes me realise how far we have come.</p>
      <p>“I’m so pleased that inclusivity remains at the core of British Vogue and that, in the time since I began here, the fashion and publishing industries have started to embrace a much more exciting and diverse idea of who can be a cover star now.</p>
      <p>“Seeing someone as amazing as Lizzo on a magazine cover has at last begun to feel normal. How incredible is that?.”</p>
