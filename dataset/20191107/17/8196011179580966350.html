      <p>With the backing of Celtic colleague Damien Duff, Keeva Keenan has taken the Ireland women’s team by storm under the Vera Pauw regime.</p>

      <p>The full-back arrived on the international stage as a 16-year-old matchwinner against England at the U19 Euro finals in 2015, only to be cast aside by Colin Bell.</p>
      <p>Keenan’s exclusion from the senior ranks during the Bell era was puzzling given she was operating to at least semi-professional level in the Scottish league.</p>
      <p>The Dubliner departed champions Glasgow City to join Celtic in early 2018 and is their reigning Player of the Year.</p>
      <p>The biggest club in Scottish football broke new ground earlier this year by upgrading the status of their squad to full-time professionals.</p>
      <p>Proof that the investment is yielding success came on Sunday when they inflicted a first defeat in three years on Glasgow City.</p>
      <p>Duff, currently assistant to Neil Lennon, has been tracking the progress of his compatriot and Keena herself feels a changing of the guard is imminent.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“Glasgow City have won every title for the past 13 seasons,” explained the defender yesterday at an Irish camp building up to Tuesday’s Euro qualifier in Greece.</p>
      <p>“The day is coming that another team will take over. Celtic are doing great things with the women’s section.</p>
      <p>“We train mostly at Lennoxstown, the same facility used by the men’s squad. I’m really enjoying my football there."</p>
      <blockquote>I met Damien Duff and Jonathan Hayes at the Player of the Year ceremony at the end of last season and they were giving their congratulations. They couldn’t have been nicer.</blockquote>
      <p>Success at international level, by earning a first-ever major qualification, would also enhance Keenan’s reputation.</p>
      <p>Pauw’s appointment in September triggered an overhaul but the comeback of Keenan was instigated by assistant boss Eileen Gleeson.</p>
      <p>“I turned Eileen down as a kid when I signed for Shelbourne rather than her Peamount side,” she explained. “We become enemies in the national league but always respected each other.</p>
      <p>“My mother Rachel and Eileen were good friends through work and I was delighted to get the call-up.</p>
      <p>“Being put straight into the starting team for the qualification win over Ukraine was a major shock. There were nerves but the win puts us in a great position to challenge to reach the 2021 Euros.”</p>
      <p>Her euphoria is a contrast to her one and only previous experience in camp.</p>
      <p>“My first day involved no training and the 14-hour meeting in a small room of a hotel,” she says, referring to the infamous strike by the players before that Slovakia friendly. “That was an interesting time but I didn’t get a shout from Colin after that.</p>
      <p>“I thought my chance of playing for Ireland again had gone but I’m glad to be part of the new set-up.”</p>
