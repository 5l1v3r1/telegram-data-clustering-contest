        <b>Ghostface is set to be resurrected</b>
      </p>
      <p>A new <i>Scream</i> movie is reportedly in production.</p>
      <p>The new film would follow 2011’s <i>Scream 4</i> and, according to <i><a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3593128/spyglass-resurrection-ghostface-new-scream-exclusive/">Bloody Disgusting</a></i>, Spyglass Media is developing the next film in the series – even after the passing of creator Wes Craven.</p>

      <p><a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/clive-barker-hellraiser-spyglass-david-goyer-1203205895/"><i>Variety</i></a> previously explained how Spyglass came to get the rights to produce a new <i>Scream </i>film, writing: “Spyglass Media Group was re-launched as a content company in March by former MGM topper Barber, Lantern Entertainment co-presidents Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic and strategic investors Eagle Pictures and Cineworld Group.”</p>

      <p>It’s not yet clear whether Craven’s co-creator Kevin Williamson will be involved in the films despite having written all four <i>Scream</i> movies thus far.</p>
      <p>There are also doubts over whether original characters Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox will appear in the forthcoming movie.</p>
      <p>Fans on social media are also questioning whether the new film will follow on with the narrative of <i>Scream 4 </i>or serve as a remake.</p>
      <p>A <i>Scream</i> TV series has been running on MTV and VH1 for three seasons (2015- 2019).</p>
      <p>Back in 2013, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/neve-campbell-on-scream-5-i-m-not-sure-they-re-goi-874724">Neve Campbell said she didn’t believe that a fifth <i>Scream</i> film would get made</a>. “I’m not sure they’re going to make it, to be honest. If that were to come up again and they were to approach me, I’d have a chat with them about it,” she said.</p>
