Hit the jump for that and more in the latest 9to5Toys Lunch Break.</p>
      <h3>Lenovo’s Assistant-loaded Smart Clock hits its Black Friday price early</h3>
      <p>B&amp;H offers the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/07/lenovo-smart-clock-black-friday/">Lenovo Smart Clock with Google Assistant for <b>$40</b></a>. That’s down from the original $80 price tag and current $60 offering at Walmart. Today’s deal is $10 less than our previous mention and the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/10/29/lenovo-black-friday-ad-2019/">expected</a> Black Friday price as well.</p>
      <p>Lenovo Smart Clock delivers a built-in display, access to Google Assistant, and more in a nightstand-appropriate design. Leverage smart features to control “more than 30,000 products” while also playing your favorite music, audiobooks, and more. We loved it in <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/06/03/lenovo-smart-clock-review/">our hands-on review</a>, noting that it’s “the only way Google Assistant should be in the bedroom.”</p>
      <h3>Samsung’s Chromebook 3 is a solid buy for kids this Christmas</h3>
