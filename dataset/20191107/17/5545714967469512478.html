      <p>I will go to bat for <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/nuclear-throne/home"><i>Nuclear Throne</i></a>, especially while the PC version is free on the Epic Games Store.</p>

      <p>Look, I get it. There's a near-endless supply of indie roguelike shooters in this world. So many of them blur together, and so very few are worth mastering. They can't all be <i>The Binding of Isaac </i>or <i>Enter the Gungeon</i>. But if you ever find yourself in the mood for just one more, for old times' sake, give <i>Nuclear Throne </i>an honest shot. It's by Vlambeer, the team behind <i>Super Crate Box</i>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-nuclear-throne-326751.phtml">and it is excellent</a>.</p>
      <p>You have until next Thursday, November 14 to become a wasteland king. No big deal.</p>

      <p>The Epic Games Store also has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/ruiner/home"><i>Ruiner</i></a>, another top-down action game, for free. It's hard too.</p>
      <p>"When all is said and done, you ultimately have a solid cyberpunk action game that has exceptional gun and melee based combat taking place in a beautifully fleshed-out world that it, unfortunately, doesn't utilize to its full potential," <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-ruiner-462750.phtml">noted Anthony Marzano, who handled our review</a>. "It may not be perfect but I can wholeheartedly recommend <i>Ruiner </i>if you are looking for a good challenge or a game that would fit perfectly in a dark room with your headphones cranked to maximum."</p>
      <p>Next week, from November 14 to November 21, the Epic Store will give out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-messenger-520344.phtml"><i>The Messenger</i></a>. That's the first one of these free-game deals in quite a while that I intent to play straight away, not just hoard.</p>

      <p><b>Disclosure-bot:</b> Just in case the editor neglected to mention it, we have zero control when deals start and end. Deals can sometimes be gone within minutes (please don't shoot the messenger). Trying deal links even hours after this article's time stamp may lead to self-punching, so maybe bookmark our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/index-huge.phtml?t=deals">video game deals</a> if you're on the hunt. Also, it goes without saying, but some shopping links do directly support the author. If you've spotted any inaccuracy please let us know asap.</p>
