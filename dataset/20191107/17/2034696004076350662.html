      <p>‘A Palé’, which Rosalía co-produced with El Guincho and Frank Dukes, starts off as a mellow tune before erupting into a bass-heavy affair for the rest of the track.</p>
      <p>It follows the musician’s critically acclaimed second album, ‘El Mal Querer’, which was released in 2018.</p>

        <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/rosalia-somerset-house-review">In the summer <i>NME’s</i> Douglas Greenwood was blown away by the star’s performance at Somerset House.</a>
      </p>
      <p>He wrote: “Rosalía is everything you could want from a pop star. She’s professional and dedicated to her craft. Her setlist is tight and she warrants the deep cuts. The dance routines are flawless, and she’s by turns humble and terrifying: being able to flit between those two is important.</p>
      <p>“…It’s a military-tight operation, but not a vapid one: the nature of Rosalía’s music demands that the artist herself takes it seriously so the desired effect takes hold…If <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> is pop’s vocal acrobat, Rosalía is its contortionist: she reaches the corners others can’t.”</p>
