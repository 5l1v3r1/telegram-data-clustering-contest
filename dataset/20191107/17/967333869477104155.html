      <p>​Earlier in the day, media reported that the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911071077242620-french-police-evacuates-migrant-camp-at-the-porte-de-la-chapelle-in-paris---video/">operation to clear out the camps in the French capital's northeast</a> had begun at 6:00 a.m. local time (05:00 GMT) with approximately 600 police officers deployed. The sweep was a response to the deteriorating sanitation and an increase in violence in the camps. The migrants, who were from Somalia, Afghanistan, Eritrea and Chad, were then bused to migration centres across the capital region.</p>
      <p>On 6 November, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911021077209967-macrons-clandestine-migrant-networks-remarks-draw-bulgarian-governments-ire/">President Emmanuel Macron announced his government's decision</a> to step up efforts against irregular migration to the country, in an attempt to wrestle the issue from the far-right National Rally political party, which used its anti-migration stance to transform into one of France's major political forces.</p>
