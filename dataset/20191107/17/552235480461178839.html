      <p>He said: "Everything is sourced from EK, nothing is frozen. We have a farm in Jackton and a new distillery there as well.</p>
      <p>"We dry age our own beef and when it touches your tongue, it is like butter."</p>
      <p>Mark and his team have been involved in this industry for over 35 years, so know exactly what they are doing.</p>
