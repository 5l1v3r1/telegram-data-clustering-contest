      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege/">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is about to head into Year 4 Season 4 in what's been called Operation Shifting Tides. In accordance with tradition, this will introduce two new operators, and new operators means cool new gadgets to try out.</p>
      <p>While we don't know a whole lot about the new operators yet, Ubisoft has gone ahead and given us a taste of the kits they'll be bringing to the field. The video above shows off a test chamber with both.</p>
      <p>One of the gadgets is rifle round for the CSRX-300 which makes a basketball-sized hole in a couple normal walls. The round will be part of new operator Kali's loadout, along with a breaching charge fired from the underbarrel grenade launcher. This, it seems, can tunnel through reinforced walls, making Kali a new hard breacher.</p>
      <p>The other new operator, Wamai, has a magnetic projectile interception system, which is an interesting piece of kit. This attaches to walls and can catch certain projectiles, freezing them in midair.Â </p>
      <p>We'll all find out more about the next Rainbow Six Siege season during the Pro League Finals November 10.</p>
