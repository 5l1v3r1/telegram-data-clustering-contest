      <h1>Publishers Should be Making E-Book Licensing Better, Not Worse</h1>

      <p>Macmillan, one of the “Big Five” publishers, is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775150979/you-may-have-to-wait-to-borrow-a-new-e-book-from-the-library">imposing new limits</a> on libraries’ access to ebooks—and libraries and their users are <a href="https://slate.com/business/2019/09/e-book-library-publisher-buying-controversy-petition.html">fighting back</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/01/775150979/you-may-have-to-wait-to-borrow-a-new-e-book-from-the-library">Starting last week</a>, the publisher is imposing a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa78wv/one-of-americas-largest-publishers-is-screwing-over-libraries">two-month embargo period</a> on library ebooks. When Macmillan releases a new book, library systems will be able to purchase only <i>one</i> digital copy for the first eight weeks after it’s published. Macmillan is offering this initial copy for half-price ($30), but that <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80758-after-tor-experiment-macmillan-expands-embargo-on-library-e-books.html">has not taken away the sting</a> for librarians who will need to answer to frustrated users. In large library systems in particular, readers are likely to experience even longer hold queues for new Macmillan e-book releases. For example, under the new Macmillan embargo, the 27 branches of the San Francisco Public Library system, serving a city of nearly 900,000 people, will have to share one single copy right when the demand for the new title is the greatest.</p>
      <p>The harms to libraries and their patrons during these two months go far beyond wait times. E-books are a critical resource for library users with vision impairment, dyslexia, and other physical or learning needs. An embargo on new e-books disproportionately harms these readers who rely on digital formats, and violates the principles of equitable access at the core of library services.</p>
      <p>After the two-month embargo period ends, libraries will be welcome to purchase additional copies of the e-book under normal terms, which aren’t great to begin with: typically, a $60 price tag for an e-book that can only be lent out to one user at a time for two years or 52 lends, whichever comes first. After that, the library has to license another e-book. On top of that, libraries tend to have different agreements with each of their publishers and vendors, all of which are subject to change.</p>
      <p>This is a significant mark-up over what a consumer might expect to pay for a new e-book, and a falsely restrictive model compared to libraries’ rights for physical books. When a library purchases a physical book, the purchase is covered by <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/firstsale2.pdf">first sale doctrine</a>, which means the library can lend it out freely, repair it, give it away, or resell it. But libraries don’t have any of those protections <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/2017/02/19/future-libraries-need-first-sale-ebooks/">when it comes to e-books</a>.</p>
      <p>So why is Macmillan imposing additional burdens? In a July <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/binary-data/ARTICLE_ATTACHMENT/file/000/004/4222-1.pdf">memo</a>, CEO John Sargent says the publisher’s move is motivated by “growing fears that library lending was cannibalizing sales” of new e-books and a need to “protect the value of your books during their first format publication,” but fails to present any evidence to back up his claims. (He also ignores existing, consistent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/06/ebook-lending-wont-put-big-dent-book-sales">evidence</a> <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/66106-the-case-for-libraries.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelkramerbussel/2019/04/12/how-libraries-boost-book-sales/#25e618334d76">the</a> <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/49316-survey-says-library-users-are-your-best-customers.html">contrary</a>.)</p>
      <p>In response, <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/10/22/41762476/king-county-public-library-will-boycott-macmillan-ebooks-seattle-public-library-will-not">libraries</a> <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2019/11/03/dmpl-boycotting-macmillan-publishing-des-moines-public-library-ebook-embargo/4152871002/">across</a> <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20191101/columbus-metropolitan-library-joins-macmillan-boycott-over-digital-books">the</a> <a href="https://library.nashville.org/blog/2019/11/npl-suspends-macmillan-ebook-purchases">country</a> have boycotted, or at least strongly <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/08/27/41213776/seattle-public-library-denounces-publishers-new-e-book-policy">denounced</a>, Macmillan e-book purchases. In another extraordinary step, the American Library Association has <a href="https://ebooksforall.org/index.php/faq/">invited library users</a> to <a href="https://ebooksforall.org/">sign onto a petition</a> against the new embargo. The campaign, called <a href="https://ebooksforall.org/">#eBooksForAll</a>, had over 160,000 signatures before the embargo started last week. Since then, the signature count has climbed to nearly 200,000.</p>
      <p>All of this does not mean that Macmillan has it wrong on e-books across the board; for example, Macmillan publishes <a href="https://boingboing.net/2012/04/24/tor-books-goes-completely-drm.html">Tor Books</a>, the only <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/drm">DRM</a>-free imprint in the Big Five.</p>
      <p>But of all the Big Five publishers to <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/libraries/article/80689-libraries-must-draw-the-line-on-e-books.html">change e-book terms in the past year</a>, Macmillan’s e-book embargo for libraries is by far the most contentious. The other four—Hachette, HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, and Simon &amp; Schuster—are surely watching the backlash. We urge readers, and authors who like to be read, to sign the <a href="https://ebooksforall.org/">ALA’s petition</a> and let Macmillan know that the embargo is a mistake.</p>
