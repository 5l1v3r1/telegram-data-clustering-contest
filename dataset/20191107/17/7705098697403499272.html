      <h1>Endgame Writers Say Captain America’s Return Would Hurt the MCU</h1>

      <p>All the beautiful things must come to an end, even Chris Evans’ run as Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Although <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame">Avengers: Endgame</a> </b>delivered a satisfying end to Steve Roger’s story, many fans are still hoping to see him wield his shield once again. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not on the same page as those fans, though. Speaking with <a href="https://screenrant.com/chris-evans-mcu-return-captain-america-endgame/">Screen Rant</a>, the <b>Endgame </b>screenwriters said that a hypothetical future return of Evans would hurt the whole MCU.</p>
      <p>“I do worry that if they do stuff like that, it’ll ding <b>Endgame</b> in the rearview mirror,” Stephen McFeely said. “This is such an important and such an interesting moment in movies, because a very successful studio just put their tools down.”</p>

      <p><b>Endgame </b>saw also Robert Downey Jr.’s Iron Man completing his mission and peacefully leaving the MCU. The plan is to leave things the way they are now for him too.</p>
      <p>“I also don’t want it,” Markus said. “I love writing for Cap, I love Evans. But I really feel, much like Tony, we got them to a place where they don’t need to do it anymore. I’d hate to gin up something hokey to get them back.”</p>
      <p>Steve Rogers’ foray in the MCU ended up after he passed the torch — and his shield — to Sam Wilson, who will likely become the new Captain America in the upcoming Marvel’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier"><b>The Falcon and The Winter Soldier</b></a> series. Maybe the <b>Endgame </b>screenwriters are right and it’s better to let him enjoy his long-coveted old age together with his beloved Peggy Carter.</p>
