      <p>Former Stonehouse Primary and Larkhall Academy pupil Brooke has been preparing for a role like this for her entire life, and hopes it leads to an extended career.</p>
      <p>“I have been performing since I was a tiny tot,” she said. “I began dancing when I was only three, and then as I got older I got very passionate about singing and acting.</p>
      <p>“At the age of 12, I got more involved in musical theatre and started going to Jazzart UK in Motherwell, where I trained.</p>
      <p>“I did New Lanark panto last year, and the year before, which I enjoyed. Then, when I was training full time at Jazzart UK, I also did panto, where we got to tour primary schools.</p>
      <p>“For the future, I hope to have the opportunity to be involved in further performances, pantos and productions that will allow me to entertain people and showcase the full extent of my ability.</p>
      <p>“I’d love to also get involved in TV; I find both stage and TV engaging, exciting, and I am at my happiest when performing.”</p>
      <p>Beauty and the Beast runs from November 17 to January 12 at Motherwell Concert Hall, and also stars Ian ‘Sheepie’ Smith as Lumiere, Liam Webster as Prince/Beast, Titus Rowe as Bouffant du Quiff, Tommy Hart as Professor Maurice and Tracey Mair as Fairy le Fou.</p>
