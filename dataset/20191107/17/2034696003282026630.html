        <b>It's a strong return</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/dave">Dave</a> has released ‘Paper Cuts’, which hears the south London star experiment with drill.</p>
      <p>The track first emerged on social media last night (November 6) and sees the Mercury Prize winner exploring the genre – popularised by stars including <a href="http://nme.com/artists/headie-one">Headie One</a> – for the first time.</p>
      <p><i>“It’s incredible scenes / You can’t make this up / Two times that a man lost blood / Football and paper cuts,”</i> Dave raps on the track.</p>
      <p>It’s also his first track since <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/dave-wins-the-hyundai-mercury-music-prize-2019-psychodrama-album-2549789">winning the Mercury Prize in September</a> for his acclaimed debut album ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dave-psychodrama-review">Psychodrama</a>‘.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what to say,” Dave said in his acceptance speech at the time. “I want to firstly thank God. I want to invite my mum up onto stage.</p>

      <p>“I want to thank everyone that made this happen, I want to thank all of the exceptional musicians who performed tonight…I respect you all so highly”. He also thanked “my mum, my family, my friends.”</p>
      <p>Last summer, he also headlined the Radio 1 Stage at Reading and Leeds Festival, which led <i>NME</i> to claim<a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/festivals-blog/10-essential-reading-leeds-2019-sets-catch-bbc-iplayer-disappear-2543587"> that it’s his latest step on the path to greatness.</a></p>
      <p>“Britain’s next festival headliner made his claim to greatness, headlining the Radio 1 tent,” we wrote.</p>
      <p>“With a Mercury nomination and a Number One in the bag for <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/dave-psychodrama-review">his debut album ‘Psychodrama’</a> in the bag, this summer has reaffirmed that Dave is on his way to being a seriously big deal, and come album two he could well be a headliner.”</p>
