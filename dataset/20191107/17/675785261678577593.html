      <h1>Arsenal join West Ham in £22m transfer battle for Eintracht Frankfurt defender Martin Hinteregger</h1>
      <h2>The 27-year-old centre back has impressed for the Bundesliga club so far this season and has been linked with a move to England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T17:40:33+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal are reportedly set to do battle with London rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> for the signature of Eintracht Frankfurt defender Martin Hinteregger.</p>
      <p>The Austria international, who has won 43 caps for his country, signed permanently for Frankfurt over the summer after impressing in a loan move from Augsburg in the second half of last season.</p>
      <p>He has since become a crucial part of the Frankfurt side, and is also a threat going forward, scoring in three of his side's last four games in all competitions, including in the 5-1 thrashing of Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Hinteregger was initially linked with the Hammers, who are looking to bolster their backline after conceding 14 goals in their last six games.</p>

      <p>But according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10298969/arsenal-transfer-22m-frankfurt-hinteregger-west-ham/">the Sun</a> the Gunners have now joined the race for the player, with manager Unai Emery desperate to sign another centre-back in January.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> brought David Luiz to the club in the summer, they still look light in the position.</p>
      <p>Although Sokratis is a more than capable partner at the back for Luiz, the error-prone Shkodran Mustafi and often-injured Rob Holding are the only natural backups, with French defender William Saliba not due to link up with the club until next season, when he has finished his season-long loan with Saint Etienne.</p>

      <p>Frankfurt will likely demand around £22m for the player, who played against the Gunners earlier this season in their 3-0 loss in the Europa League at the Commerzbank Arena.</p>
      <p>Emery will also likely get another chance to cast his eye over the defender during the rematch at the Emirates Stadium on November 28.</p>
      <p>Arsenal return to Premier League action looking for their first win in five games when they travel to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on Saturday, while West Ham are also in desperate need of victory having not won since September, and they face an away game at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> .</p>
