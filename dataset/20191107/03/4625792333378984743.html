      <p>Republican Louisiana Sen. John Kennedy bashed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during President Trump’s rally in Louisiana on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Kennedy touted Trump's economy and criticized Pelosi’s effort to impeach him.</p>
      <p>“In three short years, President Trump has doubled the growth in the greatest economy in all of human history. And do you know what our Democratic friends have done for him?” Kennedy asked. “Speaker Nancy Pelosi is trying to impeach him.”</p>
      <p>While the crowd booed, Kennedy bashed the impeachment effort as “dumb.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t mean any disrespect, but it must suck to be that dumb,” Kennedy said.</p>

      <p>Trump brought Kennedy on stage to stump for gubernatorial candidate Eddie Rispone. Republicans have a chance to flip Louisiana’s governor’s mansion out from under Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards.</p>
      <p>Kennedy urged voters to support Republicans.</p>
      <p>"Unless you are happy with crappy, I want you to vote for Eddie Rispone for governor,” he said.</p>
      <p>Louisiana's elections will take place on Oct. 12.</p>
