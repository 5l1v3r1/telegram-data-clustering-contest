      <h1>Trump's Tax Cuts: One Big Giant Mistake?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T03:45:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 03:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">James Pethokoukis</a></address>
      <p>With every economic report that fails to show the US economy consistently growing by at least 3 percent or business investment booming, it may seem increasingly obvious that the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act is a bust. At least it’s obvious to partisan pundits and the progressive Twitterverse. They’ve <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-gop-tax-cut-failed-their-response-lets-do-it-again/2019/10/31/19422660-fc13-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html">already called the time of death</a> for this key piece of Trumponomics.</p>
      <p>Now certainly the Trump tax cuts are looking like failed politics. They’re not popular, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/10/31/white-house-officials-ramp-up-new-tax-cut-talks-trump-seeks-sharp-contrast-with-democrats/">polls suggest</a>, and most people don’t think they got a tax cut. This isn’t surprising. Supporters <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-tax-cut-underdelivers-which-could-embolden-democrats-who-want-it-reversed-11572447580">oversold</a> the immediacy and power of the TCJA’s impact, as well as the nature of its pro-growth mechanism. Actually both sides misunderstood (and continue to misunderstand) how the corporate tax reform part of the TCJA was supposed to work. It was never about — at least from a proper economic perspective — companies using their tax savings to make more investments, hire more workers, and pay higher wages. Likewise the case for a corporate tax rate reduction isn’t undercut by the rise in stock buybacks.</p>
