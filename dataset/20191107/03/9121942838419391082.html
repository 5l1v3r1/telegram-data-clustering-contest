      <p>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) — Police say an apparent neighborhood dispute in north Eugene left three people wounded and the alleged gunman dead after turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p>The Register-Guard reports the victims were taken to Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in Springfield.</p>
      <p>Their conditions were not known and Police Chief Chris Skinner said he did not know if the victims, who all suffered gunshot wounds, were expected to survive.</p>
      <p>Police were called at 1:13 p.m. Wednesday to a report of shots fired.</p>
      <p>When police arrived, Skinner said they found a situation “that feels like a neighborhood dispute that went really, really bad.”</p>
      <p>The alleged shooter, estimated to be in his 70s, was found dead. Skinner says at least two handguns, owned by the man, were found at the scene.</p>
      <p>The Lane County Sheriff’s Office, the FBI and Oregon State Police also responded.</p>
