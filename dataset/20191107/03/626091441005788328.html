"In advance of <a href="https://csedweek.org/about/partners">Computer Science Education Week</a> (CSEdWeek)," announced the American Library Association (ALA), "an annual event to get students excited about coding, <a href="http://www.ala.org/tools/readytocode/minigrant">ALA will be awarding $300 mini-grants to school and public libraries that facilitate a program for youth during Computer Science Education Week</a>, December 9-15, 2019, <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/11/03/166209/google-contest-requires-teachers-to-praise-googles-cs-curriculum-for-children">using Google's CS First Hour of Code activity</a>. This year, youth can use their imagination to turn a real-life hero into a superhero using code. Code Your Hero is an activity that honors the everyday heroes in our students' lives who use their powers to better their communities. Libraries Ready to Code is an initiative of the American Library Association (ALA) and sponsored by Google, which aims to ensure libraries have the resources, capacity, and inspiration to embrace activities that promote computational thinking (CT) and coding among our nation's youth." <br/><br/>Last month, <a href="http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2019/10/ala-receives-2-million-googleorg-grant-develop-library-entrepreneurship">the ALA announced it had received a $2 million Google.org grant to develop library entrepreneurship centers</a>. In advance of last December's CSEdWeek, <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/grow-with-google/grow-google-coming-library-near-you/">Google announced a $1 million sponsorship to the ALA</a>, creating a pool of micro-funds that local libraries could access to bring digital skills training to their community in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.ala.org/pla/initiatives/google">Libraries Lead with Digital Skills</a> and <a href="http://www.ala.org/tools/readytocode/about-us">Libraries Ready to Code</a> ALA-Google joint initiatives.</i></p>
