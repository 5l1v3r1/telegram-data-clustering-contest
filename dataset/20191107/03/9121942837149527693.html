      <h1>Wenger to Bayern speculation dominates ‘klassiker’ hype</h1>

      <p>BERLIN (AP) — Who will coach Bayern Munich dominates the hype leading to its clash with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>Bayern fired coach Niko Kovac on Sunday, a day after the side’s heaviest Bundesliga defeat in more than 10 years, and former Arsenal coach Arsène Wenger has emerged as the front-runner to replace him.</p>
      <p>“I never refuse to talk to Bayern. I almost went to Bayern a long time ago. At the moment, that’s all I can say,” Wenger told Bein Sports.</p>
      <p>Wenger said he had not yet talked to the club, but he acknowledged there was interest.</p>
      <p>“I have not decided yet if I will go back on the pitch. I’m quite happy at what I do (but) I miss the pitch as well,” Wenger said. “It’s a difficult decision for me at the moment, and I will make that decision in the coming days or the coming week.”</p>
      <p>Hansi Flick, Germany coach Joachim Löw’s assistant, has the reins at Bayern. He helped the team book a place in the Champions League knockout stages with an unspectacular 2-0 win over Olympiakos on Wednesday, and will remain in charge for Dortmund’s visit on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Bayern sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has declined to confirm contact with Wenger, and said he would not confirm dealing with other candidates.</p>
      <p>Former Leipzig coach and sporting director Ralf Rangnick and Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel both reportedly declined the club, while Ajax coach Erik ten Hag ruled himself out of a midseason switch.</p>
      <p>“I can confirm that I will stay at Ajax this season. I feel a connection with the players and many people in the club,” ten Hag said.</p>
      <p>Salihamidzic said Bayern would take its time on making a decision.</p>
      <p>Whoever the club appoints will have to pick up a team clearly not playing to the strength of its individual qualities. Bayern’s 5-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt last Saturday was preceded by lackluster performances against second-division Bochum in the German Cup, promoted Union Berlin in the league, and in the first game against Olympiakos in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Bayern has already conceded more goals in the Bundesliga than Union. It’s the side’s worst defensive record since 2008 when Jürgen Klinsmann was coach.</p>

      <p>“It’s not a huge surprise what happened,” Bayern captain Manuel Neuer said of the defeat in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Bayern will be without the suspended Jérôme Boateng for Dortmund’s visit, while fellow defenders Niklas Süle and Lucas Hernández are out with injuries.</p>
      <p>Dortmund arrives for Saturday’s “klassiker” full of confidence after coming from two goals down to beat Inter Milan 3-2 in the Champions League on Tuesday. It was the side’s third consecutive win.</p>
      <p>Buoyant fans chanted to their team, “Pull Bayern’s leather trousers down!”</p>
      <p>But Dortmund, which is sweating on the fitness of forwards Jadon Sancho and Marco Reus, has lost its last five games in Munich, the last four by a heavy margin.</p>
      <p>“We’re ready for the clásico,” Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke said.</p>
