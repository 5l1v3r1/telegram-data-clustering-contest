      <h1>'Sleazeball': Trump condemns whistleblower’s attorney for calling for a coup in 2017 tweets</h1>

      <p>President Trump criticized Mark Zaid, the whistleblower’s attorney, for his 2017 tweets calling for the president to be impeached.</p>
      <p>Zaid sent <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/whistleblowers-attorney-warned-trump-a-coup-is-coming-in-2017-tweets"><u>several tweets in 2017</u></a> calling for a “rebellion” and a “coup” against Trump, hoping it would lead to an impeachment.</p>
      <p>During his rally in Louisiana on Wednesday night, Trump bashed Zaid as a “sleazeball.”</p>
      <p>“It’s all a hoax,” said Trump. “It’s a scam. And you know who helps them? These people right back here, the media.”</p>
      <p>Trump pointed to Zaid’s tweet claiming that CNN could “play a key role” in his impeachment.</p>

      <p>Trump has been adamant that the whistleblower be identified and testify in the impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>Zaid vowed to keep his client’s identity private, calling any effort to reveal the name “the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/pinnacle-of-irresponsibility-attorneys-decline-to-confirm-cia-officer-eric-ciaramella-is-whistleblower"><u>pinnacle of irresponsibility</u></a>.”</p>
