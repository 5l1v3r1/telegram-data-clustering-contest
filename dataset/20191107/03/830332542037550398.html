      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Edgewood College is committing more than $15,000 to enrichment opportunities for students who are a part of the Boys &amp; Girls Club's college readiness program. </p>
      <p>Edgewood officials signed that agreement Wednesday. </p>
      <p>The money will help students continue on a path to success, giving them access to dedicated advising services and providing office space for Boys &amp; Girls Club staff to work with them on Edgewood's campus.</p>
      <p>"It just allows us to better support more of a wrap-around style to ensure our students have access to tools, resources and support that they need to make sure they make it to the finish line," said Glenna Scholle-Malone, assistant vice president of College Persistence and Special Projects.</p>
      <p>There are more than 45 students at Edgewood who began their college careers through the Boys &amp; Girls Club AVID/TOPS program.</p>
