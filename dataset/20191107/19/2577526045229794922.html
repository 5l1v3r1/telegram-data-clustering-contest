      <p><i>Death Stranding</i> is upon us! Kojima Productions’ bizarre and super-massive exploration game brims with symbolism, clumsy stumbling, and gnarly ghosts. My pal Tim Rogers and I sat down to play the first chapter and talk about movies and all sorts of other stuff as we helped Sam Porter Bridges on his trek through the wasteland.</p>

      <p>Full disclosure: Tim and I recorded this maybe two weeks ago, packed into our stuffy studio space. For about a week before we recorded this, we had been starting our days by talking to each other about where we were in <i>Death Stranding</i>. <i>Oh wow, bud, have you seen this? What’s up with having a character called Bridget Strand? How about that music? Can you grab me some footage of Sam pissing on an enemy?</i> It was a solid morning ritual, since <i>Death Stranding</i> is a game that demands to be discussed with other people. It’s a “water-cooler game,” a “forum-post goldmine,” a “sports conversation killer.”</p>
      <p>I have not yet watched this video and all its ramblings, and I don’t remember all of it, but I’m pretty sure I reference Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr while Tim talks about Andrei Tarkovsky. There’s a lot going on in this game, and I encourage you to luxuriate in the marinade of exploration and conversation.</p>
