      <p>A dog owner who gagged her pet with a taped-on muzzle and left it without food or water before going on holiday has been branded “sickening” by a sheriff.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Steel, 44, abandoned the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dogs">Collie cross</a> , called Rio, after covering its face with a makeshift gag so it couldn’t bark.</p>
      <p>Police forced entry to Steel’s home in Kilmarnock after a neighbour heard a noise and spotted the stricken dog through a window.</p>
      <p>It then emerged Rio was infested with fleas and suffering from sores and a skin condition, the town’s sheriff court heard yesterday.</p>
      <p>Steel, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock">Kilmarnock,</a> admitted causing unnecessary suffering by taping a muzzle to the dog’s face, denying it food, water or a means of escape, and failing to provide adequate care and treatment between July 18 and 19.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Blaire Ford, prosecuting, said an upstairs neighbour could hear the dog “grunting” below and knew Steel had gone on holiday the day before for the weekend.</p>
      <p>She added: “He looked through the kitchen window and observed the dog locked within the kitchen with a muzzle on, which was wrapped with black tape, and noted that there was no food or water.”</p>
      <p>The man called the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/anger-video-showing-dogs-kept-20695417">Scottish SPCA</a> , which was unable to respond initially, before contacting police the following day. Officers broke in using a battering ram after seeing Rio lying motionless.</p>
      <p>Ford said: “The dog was alive and had begun to move around. There was no food or water in the dog bowls and the dog was wearing a muzzle wrapped in black tape and had a collar on which was too tight.”</p>
      <p>Rio was taken to a vet for treatment and then found temporary refuge.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Sheriff Alistair Watson warned Steel she would likely face a control order over the keeping of animals in future.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Watson added: “This is a pretty sickening piece of behaviour towards a dog and I will have to consider how to deal with you on the next occasion.”</p>
      <p>Sentence was deferred for reports.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/sspca">Scottish SPCA</a> chief inspector Laura McIntyre said: “This was an awful case of cruelty causing Rio to suffer unnecessarily. We are pleased Steel has admitted the offence and look forward to hearing the sentencing in this case.”</p>
