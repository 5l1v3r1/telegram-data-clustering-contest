      <p>(NEW YORK) — A New York judge ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit alleging he misused his charitable foundation to further his political and business interests.</p>
      <p>Judge Saliann Scarpulla also signed off on an agreement Thursday to close the Trump Foundation and distribute about $1.7 million in remaining funds to other nonprofit groups.</p>
      <p>A request for comment was emailed to Trump’s lawyer.</p>
      <p>New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit last year alleging Trump and his family illegally operated the foundation as an extension of his businesses and his presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Letitia James had been seeking about $2.8 million in restitution from the president. Scarpulla cut that amount to $2 million.</p>
      <p>Foundation lawyers have previously said the lawsuit is politically motivated.</p>
