      <p>HELENA, Mont. - The discovery of two fossilized dinosaur skeletons intertwined in what looks like a final death match could make a central Montana ranching couple rich beyond their wildest dreams. Or, they may have to share the wealth.</p>
      <p>It all comes down to how the state Supreme Court answers a seemingly simple question: Are fossils minerals?</p>
      <p>The outcome is key to a federal case over ownership of the "dueling dinosaurs," worth more than $5 million, and distribution of millions of dollars in proceeds from the sale of other fossils unearthed on the property.</p>
      <p>A federal appeals court asked the justices whether fossil finds in Montana are part of the surface estate or the mineral rights. The ranch has split ownership.</p>
      <p>The state justices heard arguments Thursday but did not make a ruling.</p>
