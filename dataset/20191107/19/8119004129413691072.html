        <b>The government is planning to send back 11,000 foreigners, who are living in Bangladesh illegally after expiry of their visas, with its own money.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Huq revealed the plan after a meeting of the cabinet committee on law and order at the home ministry in Dhaka on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Many remain in the country after their visas expire. We had decided in a joint meeting earlier to identify them because they can’t stay. Our intelligence agencies have identified them successfully,” Mozammel said.</p>
      <p>“But the problem is that they don’t even have the money for return travel.Moreover, their countries don’t have embassies where we can hand them,” the minister said.</p>
      <p>Keeping them in prison may encourage them to engage in criminal activities, according to Mozammel.</p>
      <p>“So we’ve decided to ask the government for allocating some money to send the illegal migrants back to their homelands,” he said.</p>
      <p>Most of the 11,000 illegal foreigners are from African countries like Nigeria and Tanzania, according to the minister.</p>
