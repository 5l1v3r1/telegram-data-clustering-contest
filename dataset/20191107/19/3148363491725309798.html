      <h1>Antonio Brown Unleashed: 'F*ck the NFL...Treat Black People the Worse!'</h1>
      <h2>If you thought that Antonio Brown and the NFL were mending fences and on their way back to establishing normal relations, think again.</h2>

      <p>Brown began by lamenting the fact that he had conformed to the “system,” and proceeded to blast the league for treating black people unfairly.</p>

      <p>As of the time of this writing, the tweet has been posted for an hour and not followed up by another.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/antonio-brown-twitter-rant-f-k-the-nfl/?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow"><i>New York Post</i></a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Brown’s tirade against the league, came just hours after ESPN reported <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/antonio-brown-gets-nfl-meeting-date-and-signing-hope/">he had an interview with the NFL set for Wednesday</a> and was eager to clear his name. The NFL has been investigating accusations of sexual misconduct by the 31-year-old receiver, who has been cut by the Raiders and Patriots this year, for two months.</blockquote>
      <p>One might assume that based on Brown’s Thursday post, that meeting didn’t go the way the former Patriot had hoped.</p>
      <p>In a separate Instagram post, Brown doubled-down on being done with the league and bid a colorful farewell to fantasy football owners.</p>
      <p>“F–k @nfl I’m going down another path no more making money off my blood and sweat!” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4knaNvhozz/">Brown wrote.</a> “No more control of my name and body clear my name I am done with it ! So you fantasy f–ks can let it go.”</p>
