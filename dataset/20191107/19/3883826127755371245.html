        <b>Great Britain's Paul Blake dominated to win T36 800m gold on the first day of the World Para-Athletics Championships.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who previously won the title in 2013 and 2015, finished in two minutes 07.44 seconds in Dubai.</p>
      <p>Algeria's Sid Ali Bouzourine took silver, seven seconds back, with Spain's Jose Pampano taking bronze.</p>
      <p>"It was good fun," he told BBC Sport. "My coach told me to go through in exactly what I went through so I'm happy with that.</p>
      <p>"Normally I get too excited and shoot off before dying towards the end, but that wasn't the case this time, I got my tactics right on the day and came through.</p>
      <p>"To come away with a gold for Great Britain is always massive."</p>
      <p>The medal is Britain's first in Dubai but their second of the competition after Derek Rae took silver in the T45/46 category at the London Marathon - which doubled as a World Championship race.</p>
      <p>Blake, who has cerebral palsy, will also compete in the 400m in Dubai - the event in which he is the current Paralympic champion - with heats starting next Wednesday.</p>
      <p>However, he will not race the 800m at the Tokyo Paralympics next year as the event has not been included in the programme.</p>
      <p>"It's a real shame, because the strength in depth is there, but it just demoralises the event," he said.</p>
      <p>"There's more than enough athletes to put it on. It forces the other T36 athletes to move down to the sprints because it's a medal event in Tokyo, but if you don't come from a sprint background like I don't, it's really hard to make the transition."</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Britain's reigning world champion Sammi Kinghorn eased through her T53 100m heat, winning in a season's best time of 16.39 seconds.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who was out of action for seven weeks in the summer after having surgery in June, will compete in the final on Friday.</p>
      <p>But Mickey Bushell finished fifth in his T53 100m heat, while British team-mate Nathan Maguire also missed out on a final after finishing last in his T54 100m semi-final.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old still has plenty to come though as he is due to also compete in the 400m, 800m and universal 4x100m relay later in the championships.</p>
