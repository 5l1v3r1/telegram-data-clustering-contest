      <p>Obama is already a co-chair, along with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Faith Hill, Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson, and basketball star Chris Paul.</p>
      <p>When We Vote bills itself as a nonpartisan group dedicated to increasing voter participation. The announcement Thursday marks a year until the date of the 2020 elections, which includes the presidential race.</p>
      <p>The organization was founded in 2018.</p>
      <p>Hanks said “registering new voters is an act of hope and taking part in the American idea.” He added that voting guarantees the blessings of “liberty for the grandkids.”</p>
