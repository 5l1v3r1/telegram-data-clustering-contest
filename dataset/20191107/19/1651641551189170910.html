      <h1>Dell releases new, detailed patent for foldable PC</h1>

      <p>News of Dell’s dual-screened, foldable Windows 10 device first came to light over a <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/leaked-demo-app-confirms-dell-is-working-on-a-dual-screened-windows-10-device/">year</a> ago; for which the company has since filed many different <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/this-might-be-sneak-peak-into-dells-upcoming-foldable-pc/">patents</a>.</p>
      <p>In a new patent, we can see the hinge design which creates a visible gap in the closed state.  The device with the hinge gap is likely to feature a folding screen , similar to Samsung’s folding PC.</p>

      <p>Also included in the patent is an alternative hinge design, which allows the laptop to close without a gap:</p>

      <p>Here we can see display borders, which move via a roller, and assist in folding and help prevent damage:</p>

      <p>The foldable PC is predicted to be released in the second half of 2020 and will include the much anticipated <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/?s=windows+10x">Windows 10X</a>– a version of Windows 10 that has been tailored to dual-screen devices.</p>
