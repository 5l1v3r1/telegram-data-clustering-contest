      <h1>Loki Series Will Tie Into Doctor Strange Sequel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:37:37+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Marvel Studios is producing a number of original shows for Disney+, and they are going to have deeper ties with the MCU than previous Marvel TV shows. Kevin Feige recently chatted with <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/bq-blue-exclusive/inside-disney-bob-iger-on-star-wars-pixar-and-more">Bloomberg</a> about how deeply the shows will connect. And there’s one particular connection fans may not have seen coming.</p>
      <p>The reporter explained, “If you want to understand everything in future movies, he says, you’ll probably need a Disney+ subscription because events from the new shows will factor into forthcoming films such as <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/doctor-strange"><b>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</b></a>. The Scarlet Witch will be a key character in that movie, and Feige points out that the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/loki"><b>Loki</b></a> series will tie in, too. ‘I’m not sure we’ve actually acknowledged that before,’ he says. ‘But it does.’”</p>
      <p>There’s a possibility that Loki’s vanishing with the Tesseract in <b>Avengers: Endgame</b> might set up branching timeline within the MCU. However, story details are scarce for that series.</p>

      <p>There’s also Scarlet Witch’s angle. <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/wandavision"><b>WandaVision</b></a> looks to reunite her with Vision. Feige has previously said that show will have <b>Multiverse</b> implications as well.</p>
      <p>The first of the new Marvel shows, <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier"><b>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</b></a>, is <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/470846-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-begins-filming">currently in production</a>. It will debut sometime in fall 2020. Other shows, including <b>Loki, WandaVision</b> and <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/hawkeye"><b>Hawkeye</b></a>, will follow in 2021.</p>
