      <p>Raheem Sterling is set to sign a "game-changing" deal with kit manufacturers Puma.</p>
      <p>England star Sterling has taken over from David Beckham as the hottest property in football and his new lucrative boot deal is another sign of his popularity.</p>
      <p>It is a huge coup by Puma to get the Manchester City forward who has become the biggest star in English football and has huge marketing potential.</p>
      <p>Sterling has been with Nike but boot manufacturers have been ready to break the bank to get him when his deal expires next year.</p>
      <p>He has become the most attractive player in the country and is a sign of his pulling power.</p>

      <p>Sterling has been signed up as the new face of Gillette, is doing an advert for Pepsi and is doing a tie-up with H&amp;M.</p>
      <p>He has more than six million followers on Instagram and starred in an advert for video game FIFA 2020.</p>
      <p>It is a blow for Nike who have also lost Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who is set to join Adidas next summer.</p>
      <p>Sterling has a voice on anti-racism campaigns and his advisers have also been working on a film about his life and rise to fame.</p>
      <p>The ex-Liverpool star has won back-to-back titles with Manchester City and, incredibly, has already scored 18 goals for club and country this season.</p>

      <h3>Norwich learn financial lessons from 2016 relegation</h3>
      <p>Struggling Norwich have covered themselves by putting 50 per cent pay cut clauses in the majority of their player contracts to cover themselves in the event of relegation.</p>
      <p>They trebled the wages of some players last summer, taking the average earning to around £30,000-a-week but have been shrewd so the cost of relegation would not cripple the club in the long-term.</p>
      <p>Many clubs have a relegation clause but not as much as 50 per cent and it seems Norwich have learned a lesson from their last time in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>They signed Steven Naismith from Everton in January 2016 on a £52,000-a-week contract. He spent the last 18 months of his contract on loan at Hearts but still pocketed a hefty promotion bonus after Norwich won the title before his deal eventually expired last summer.</p>

      <h3>A new spying scandal?</h3>
      <p>Liquid Football is one of the best podcasts around - and might just have unearthed another spying scandal.</p>
      <p>Former Stoke forward Jon Walters claimed on the show that clubs go to all sorts of lengths to watch, film and spy on training sessions and behind-closed-doors games.</p>
      <p>Walters said: “I know of, I’m not going to say who, one club, they’ll go and watch a match with a pair of glasses with a camera in the glasses to film it, to get any advantage, set pieces or anything like that. That’s top level and so it does go on.”</p>

      <h3>Bulgarian FA chiefs left embarrassed</h3>
      <p>There is frustration and embarrassment within the Bulgarian FA after last month’s events in Sofia.</p>
      <p>Frustration because they quickly identified the group of supporters in the stands making racist chants during England’s Euro 2020 qualifier.</p>
      <p>The police refused to remove them despite warnings that it was a co-ordinated event from far right political parties.</p>
      <p>Incredibly, public pressure led to those involved being identified and some were found, fined and yet no serious charges brought.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>One got a bigger fine for twice ‘mooning’ in the stands than others did for racist gestures.</p>
      <p>And there was embarrassment because Bulgarian FA chiefs feel strongly that their own country’s laws are not strong enough.</p>
      <p>They were subjected to insulting anti-Bulgarian chants in Serbian when they played in Kosovo but expect England to get a good reception later this month.</p>
      <p>Kosovan people like England for their role with the UN in helping them gain independence in 2008 and there are a whole generation called ‘Tony’ after ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>

      <h3>Atkinson holds his hands up after Emirates mistake</h3>
      <p>Word reaches this column that referee Martin Atkinson was fuming with VAR himself when Arsenal defender Sokratis had a goal ruled out against Crystal Palace last month.</p>
      <p>Perhaps that explains why Atkinson lost faith at Everton last Sunday and left it to VAR to make several key decisions.</p>
      <p>The Southern-based managers met last week, the Northern contingent in Manchester on Thursday and one attendee insisted they are still backing VAR, do not see it as much of a disaster as some but do want screens to be used - and have told refs’ boss Mike Riley as such.</p>
