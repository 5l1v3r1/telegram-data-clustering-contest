      <p>The report did not give a specific reason for Earl Matthews’ exit, but an NSC spokesperson praised Matthews and told Politico that “we have no doubt he will continue to serve his country well in his future endeavors.”</p>
      <p>There are no plans to replace Matthews, according to the report, which noted that Robert O’Brien, the national security advisor who succeeded John Bolton, has sought to shrink the size of the NSC.</p>
      <p>Matthews sat in on meetings with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky while traveling with Bolton in Europe, Politico said.

      <p>An administration official told Politico that Matthews had not been wrapped up in the House impeachment probe, for which other key witnesses having testified after resigning from their posts in Trump’s administration.</p>
      <p>The House requested the voluntary testimony of Bolton, but doesn’t appear to be willing to go court to secure it.</p>
