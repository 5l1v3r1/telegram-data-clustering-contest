      <p>REUTERS: Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Thursday (Nov 7) it had filed for European approval for its experimental vaccine regimen to protect against a strain of Ebola virus that most commonly causes outbreaks of the deadly disease.</p>
      <p>The company said it submitted two marketing authorization applications to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for its two-dose vaccine targeting the Zaire strain of the Ebola virus.</p>

      <p>The company's vaccine regimen requires two injections eight weeks apart.</p>
      <p>Last month, Merck &amp; Co's Ebola vaccine was recommended for approval by the EMA, in a move hailed by the World Health Organization as a "triumph for public health" that could save many lives.</p>
