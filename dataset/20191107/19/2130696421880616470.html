      <h1>Allied Tech expects nine-month net loss in Q3 results</h1>

      <p>CATALIST-LISTED precision engineering firm Allied Technologies expects to post a net loss for the nine months to Sept 30, the board warned in a bourse filing on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>The board pointed the finger for the expected loss at a decline in gross profit margin, which it blamed on a challenging business environment and global economic uncertainties.</p>
      <p>Its guidance is based on a preliminary review of the unaudited consolidated financial results, which are still being finalised and will be disclosed by Nov 14.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime, shareholders and potential investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the shares of the company,” said the board.</p>
      <p>Trading in Allied Tech shares has been suspended since early May, amid concerns raised by auditor Ernst &amp; Young over the company’s financials. The company has also been haunted by the disappearance of more than S$33 million from an escrow account later that month.</p>
