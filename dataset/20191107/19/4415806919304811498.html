      <h1>Lowry and Harrington both off the pace in Turkey</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:40:46+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Shane Lowry has said his level-par opening round, leaving him seven shots off the leaders, wasn't the ideal start to the Turkish Airlines Open.</p>
      <p>The Open champion is just one shot off current Race to Dubai leader Bernd Wiesberger, with Lowry currently third in the Race to Dubai standings.</p>
      <p>The tournament is being played on the Colin Montgomerie-designed Montgomerie Maxx Royal, and Lowry was critical of the greens speaking after his round.</p>
      <p>“I played lovely all day, I can’t play any better than that but I literally couldn’t get the ball in the hole from three feet,” Lowry said.</p>
      <p>When pressed on conditions, Lowry remarked: "No, the greens are not great to be honest. I'm not going to stand here and give out too much about it. Being last off wasn't a great draw today."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Padraig Harrington shot a disappointing 75 to leave him on three-over after day one of the competition. Harrington made ten on the par 5 fourth hole after finding the water three times, but recovered well with three birdies from the last four holes and sits in a tie for 71st place.</p>
      <p>Tom Lewis and Matthias Schwab are joint leaders on 7-under, with Justin Rose just one shot off the pace.</p>
