      <h1>Judge orders Trump to pay $2m over misuse of charity</h1>

      <p>The Associated Press reports that <a href="https://apnews.com/7b8d0f5ce9cb4cadad948c2c414afd57?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">a New York judge today ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2m for misusing the Trump Foundation</a>, supposedly a charity but evidently an extension of his political and business interests.</p>
      <blockquote>Judge Saliann Scarpulla also signed off on an agreement Thursday to close the Trump Foundation and distribute about $1.7 million in remaining funds to other nonprofit groups. A request for comment was emailed to Trump’s lawyer. New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit last year alleging Trump and his family illegally operated the foundation as an extension of his businesses and his presidential campaign.</blockquote>
