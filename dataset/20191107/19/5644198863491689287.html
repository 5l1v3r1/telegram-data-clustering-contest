      <p>SHANGHAI: China, which is among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear, has decided against eliminating the mining of the cryptocurrency, the state planner has indicated.</p>
      <p>The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in April sought public opinion on a revised list of industries it wanted to encourage, restrict or eliminate. Bitcoin mining was among the activities on the list at the time.</p>

      <p>However, the final list published by the state planner on Wednesday (Nov 6) did not mention bitcoin mining. Its exclusion was reported by industry website CoinDesk.</p>
      <p>It was not clear what the NDRC's reasons were. The NDRC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.</p>
      <p>China is the world's largest market for computer hardware designed to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but such activities have fallen in a regulatory grey area.</p>
      <p>While China has been developing its own digital currency, it has in recent years moved to tightly regulate the wider sector.</p>
      <p>In 2017, it started to ban initial coin offerings and shut cryptocurrency trading exchanges and it also began to limit cryptocurrency mining, forcing many firms - among them some of the world's largest - to find bases elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Nearly half of bitcoin mining pools – groups of miners who team up for economies of scale - are in the Asia-Pacific, a Cambridge University study said last year.</p>
      <p>Chinese companies are also among the biggest manufacturers of bitcoin mining gear.</p>
      <p>Last month, Canaan Creative, one of China's biggest bitcoin mining hardware makers, filed to publicly list on the Nasdaq to raise US$400 million (£311 million), its third attempt to do so after previous failed tries in mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>
