      <h1>Andy Robertson in hilarious social media move as he reminds everyone of his nationality</h1>
      <h2>The Liverpool star wrapped up almost every inch of his face and head – then sent out a message.</h2>

      <p>Liverpool star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/andy-robertson">Andy Robertson</a> has reminded his 786,000 Twitter followers of his nationality in a hilarious post.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old took to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/social-media">social media</a> on Thursday evening by uploading a picture <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> for one would not approve of.</p>
      <p>Robertson is well known for being a hardy soul. His giving Lionel Messi a slap on the back of the head as the Barcelona superstar appealed for a foul during last season’s Champions League semi-final kind of summed him up.</p>
      <p>But he felt compelled to spell out exactly where he’s from after wearing a snood AND a wooly hat that covered almost every inch of his head and face.</p>
      <p>Uploading the image Robertson tweeted: "I am Scottish, I promise."</p>
      <p>Robertson again played a part for Jurgen Klopp’s side on Tuesday night when they beat Belgians Genk 2-1 in their Champions League group clash.</p>
      <p>The left-back was starring for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> a day after again being called up to Steve Clarke’s side for the final two Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
