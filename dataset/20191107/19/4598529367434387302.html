      <p>The Washington Post defended its reporters on Thursday after President Donald Trump bashed them over the paper’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-wanted-barr-to-hold-news-conference-saying-the-president-broke-no-laws-in-call-with-ukrainian-leader/2019/11/06/16d541ec-ff55-11e9-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html">new report</a> about him and Attorney General Bill Barr.</p>
      <p>“The Post fully stands behind its story and its reporters, who are among the finest journalists anywhere,” Marty Baron, the Post’s executive editor, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/kriscoratti/status/1192479825950388230">statement</a>. “The president continues to make false accusations against news organizations and individual journalists.”</p>
      <p>“Despite his repugnant attempt to intimidate and harass The Post and its staff, we will continue to do the work that democracy demands of a free and independent press,” he continued.</p>
      <p>Baron issued the statement an hour after Trump attacked Post reporters Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey and Carol Leonnig, whom the President called “lowlife reporters.”</p>
      <p>Trump had flown into a rage after they reported that he had asked Barr to hold a press conference declaring that he had not broken any laws when he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate 2020 rival Joe Biden and right-wing conspiracy about a DNC server.</p>
      <p>The President responded to the report on Thursday morning with a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192307858366271490">series</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192418595323682817">furious</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192438178747170816">tweets</a> claiming that the “degenerate Washington Post” had “MADE UP” the story.</p>
      <p>“The Amazon Washington Post and three lowlife reporters, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey, and Carol Leonnig, wrote another Fake News story, without any sources (pure fiction), about Bill Barr &amp; myself,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1192463709400117250">ranted</a>. “We both deny this story, which they knew before they wrote it. A garbage newspaper!”</p>
