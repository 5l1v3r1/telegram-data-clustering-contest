      <p>Holocaust survivor Liliana Segre was placed under police protection after she received threats from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/spotlight/politics.html">far-right</a> fanatics, highlighting concern about rising intolerance in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/italy.html">Italy</a>.</p>
      <p>Segre, 89, called last month for the creation of a parliamentary commission to investigate hate, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/racism.html">racism</a>, and anti-Semitism after she was the subject of a daily barrage of abuse on <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/social-media.html">social media</a>.</p>
      <p>Parliament approved her motion, but without votes from Italy's right-wing parties.</p>
      <p>The resulting controversy has only added to the abuse, with a neo-Nazi group this week hanging up a banner to denounce anti-fascism close to where Segre was making a public appearance.</p>

      <p>On Thursday, Italian state radio said Milan's prefect, who reports to the interior minister, assigned a Carabinieri paramilitary police security detail to Segre because of the threats against her.</p>
      <p>A security source said the police were only accompanying her to public events and were not providing round-the-clock protection.</p>
      <p>Segre declined to comment on being assigned a police escort.  </p>
      <p>"It must be said that Liliana receives vastly more messages of support and solidarity than she does hate messages," said Paola Gargiulo, Segre's chief of staff.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment from the leaders of the main rightist parties, the League and Brothers of Italy, who opposed Segre's call for a parliamentary commission, warning it could lead to censorship.</p>
      <h3>Rise in anti-Semitism</h3>
      <p>Segre was deported from Italy to Auschwitz in 1944 when she was 13 - one of 776 Italian children under the age of 14 who were sent to the Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Only 25 survived.</p>
      <p>She has dedicated much of her time in recent years to visiting schools to recount the horrors of the Holocaust and was named a life senator in 2018.</p>
      <p>Israel's ambassador to Italy, Dror Eydar, expressed dismay at the news Segre needed a police escort.</p>
      <p>"An 89-year-old Holocaust survivor under guard symbolises the danger that Jewish communities still face in Europe today," he wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Government ministers also expressed solidarity. "Forgive us Liliana. The politics of hate will not stop your commitment, nor ours," Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova tweeted.</p>
      <p>The Milan-based Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation (CDEC), which disclosed the hateful messages directed towards Segre on social media, said anti-Semitism appeared to be increasing in Italy, but was still much less pronounced than in France and the UK. </p>
      <p>CDEC researcher Stefano Gatti said until the beginning of November, 190 cases of anti-Semitism had been reported in Italy against 197 in all of 2018 and 130 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Most were social media attacks and verbal insults, with just two acts of minor violence registered this year.</p>
      <p>"The anti-Semitism we are seeing is getting more aggressive, but the number of anti-Semites in Italy is largely stable," said Gatti, pointing to surveys that suggested about 11 percent of Italians were hostile to or prejudiced against Jews. </p>
