      <p>An unemployed single mum from Plymouth has just been given the opportunity of a lifetime after a chance meeting at the Jobcentre.</p>
      <p>Jodie Graygoose, aged 30, was attending a routine appointment when she was approached by Peter Kelly, CEO of Imployable, who wanted to gift something incredible to her - a one percent share of his company. </p>
      <p>The incredible chance meeting was all filmed by hidden cameras and it was completely random Jodie, who lives with her eight-year-old son Riley, sat it the right seat at 10.10am. That time slot was drawn from a hat in days prior to ensure this.</p>
      <p>But the life-changing act is about more than just the money. I visited her at her home in Whitleigh and also met the kittens and my new best mate, Buzz the staffy to find out what happens next.</p>
      <p>Talking about the day it happened, Jodie said: "It was half term, and I had to get the kids ready. Well, my child, and I was babysitting too. We got to the Jobcentre in the pouring rain, and this guy came over and asked if we could have a chat.</p>
      <h3>'I was in shock. Why would you do that?'</h3>
      <p>"I didn’t mind, I was there early anyway. I thought it would waste some time while waiting. We went in and I was like, ‘Wait, what?’ I’m thinking, this isn’t happening. Surely he’s going to say he’s just joking. Apparently it wasn’t a joke.</p>

      <p>"He said he wanted to gift me something. He asked how I feel about being at the Jobcentre, I said they help with what they can. He told me he used to come to this Jobcentre and explained what he’s been doing, it was brilliant.</p>
      <p>"He said ‘I want to gift you 1 per cent' and I was in shock. Why would you do that? I’ve now met Pete a couple of times and he’s absolutely lovely, such a genuine guy.</p>
      <p>"It’s nice to be part of it, he keeps me updated. I wouldn’t claim to know anything about shares and don’t know what one per cent means. I’m terrible with numbers, so when he was writing it down I was like, ‘Come on, dumb it down for me.’</p>
      <p>"When I went to the offices to meet the team, we sat down and he talked me through it. When he told me I was like, ‘Oh my God, you must be crazy to give somebody you don’t know that kind of money.’</p>

      <p>"He said it was his way of giving back. People ask me how I feel and I still don’t think it’s really happening. I had to go to my Jobcentre appointment after, then rang my sister. She was like, ‘Are you sure?' And I didn’t know. We were very sceptical about it.</p>
      <p>"Obviously now I know it's real. I speak to Pete quite often and ask how it’s going. He’ll say it’s all good and that they’ve had meetings with so and so. And I’m like ‘Epic.’ I don’t know who these people are half the time but it’s nice to know what’s going on."</p>
      <p>I asked if she felt a part of Imployable, she said: "Definitely. In the long run it’s going to be a complete change to my life.  I’m not ready to give it away yet, though. I think it could make a lot more and he’s capable of doing very big things. I can put money into it and get more shares, but I’m just letting it sit."</p>
      <p>I asked if she had a plan down the line, 'not a clue' was her answer. That’s quite exciting, I replied. "It’s a bit scary though isn’t it?" She said back. "It could’ve been anyone, I usually sit the other end I just sat in that chair for some unknown reason. Strange, but something drew me there.</p>

      <p>"I just happen to be the person who sat in that seat. Wow. The Jobcentre was quite busy, it could’ve been anyone that sat there. I’m a bit in shock that it was me. I watch the video and I’m like ‘that’s me.’ I’m in shock really, it’s surreal."</p>
      <p>I was also in shock, 'it’s £32k' I said. At the minute, she joked. "The possibilities are endless, it’s crazy. I lived in a flat before this and I fell on my feet with this house. Maybe I’d buy this house? I know people my age who are married and own a house, I’m like ‘Hang on?! How have you managed that?’</p>
      <p>"It’s strange, people say ‘well you have all this money’ and I don’t have the money, it’s sat there, waiting for me."</p>
      <p>I asked if her son knows about it. She said: “He was there, he’s really shy though so he just hid behind a chair. We left and I tried explaining it to him.</p>
      <p>“Then he saw the video and said, ‘That’s my mum’s friend and he gave her some busisness.’ I guess if that’s the way you look at it. He’s eight, and I can’t even get my head around it."</p>
      <p>Her day-to-day life hasn't changed yet, she described it as: "I drop to Riley to school, do a bit of housework and some shopping. Obviously I’m unemployed at the minute, which majorly sucks. I am hoping to get hired. I volunteer at a children’s centre."</p>

      <p>Jodie grew up in North Prospect and enjoyed her time there, she said: "From what I remember it was good. We had a close community, it's like here. There are a lot of children that live here and will grow up together. That’s what we had."</p>
      <p>On the gift, Peter Kelly said: "It is very rare that you get the opportunity to change someone's life directly, this campaign was about giving a gift to someone who is deserving of a break whilst inspiring entrepreneurs to increase their social value and close the gap between businesses and society. I hope that people in the same position as Jodie can be inspired, be open to opportunity and achieve more than their circumstances dictate."</p>
      <p>Imployable have taken the first step for entrepreneurs to start sharing their wealth and empowering everyday people. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuRdd5pxpqg&amp;feature=youtu.be">The film can be seen here.</a></p>
      <p>Six other companies have already signed up to follow Peter Kelly's example and are set to gift equity totalling over £300,000.</p>
