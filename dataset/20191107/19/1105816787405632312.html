      <h1>Erdogan threatens to 'open the gates' to Europe for migrants</h1>

      <p><b>BUDAPEST: </b>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday repeated his threat to “open the gates” for migrants to enter Europe unless more international support was provided, during a visit to Hungary on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Whether or not support comes, we will continue to host our guests, but only up to a point,” Erdogan said at a news conference alongside Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</p>
      <p>“If we see that this does not work, just like I said before, we will have no option left but to open the gates. If we open the gates, it is obvious where they will go,” Erdogan added.</p>
      <p>Erdogan has called on EU countries to provide more financial support for his plan to create a “safe zone” in Syria where refugees can be repatriated.</p>
      <p>Orban has been one of Europe’s most outspoken opponents of accepting refugees and migrants, particularly from Muslim countries, and has backed Erdogan’s efforts to repatriate them.</p>
      <p>“There are four million migrants in our country,” Erdogan said. “It is possible that a serious number of those migrants will migrate to Europe.</p>
      <p>“The safe zone we want to create aims to ensure the migrants that are in our country go back to their homes, their lands.”</p>
      <p>The EU criticised Turkey’s offensive last month in northern Syria, which was designed to create the “safe zone”.</p>
      <p>Erdogan said the EU’s approach was “far from being constructive lately…. With that attitude, they only harm their own interests.”</p>
