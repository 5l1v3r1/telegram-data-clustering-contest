      <p>Maya Jama took to Instagram to show off a bloody wound on the top of her head.</p>
      <p>The Radio 1 presenter had whacked her head on a door handle in her apartment, splitting her head open.</p>
      <p>The 25 year old captioned a video: "When will the bad luck end?!"</p>
      <p>She laughed: "Not gonna lie, Mercury retrograde thing, this is mad.</p>
      <p>"I just bent over and hit my head on my door handle and my head split open.</p>
      <p>"What the f**k is going on? I do not have time."</p>
      <p>The camera then cuts to Maya with a man. She tells fans: "So, the lovely gym manager in my apartments has come to save the day."</p>

      <p>Leaning closer to the camera to give a good view of the cut, she chuckled: "Look at the f*****g state."</p>
      <p>"You gotta laugh," she continued, "You have to laugh. I'm not gonna lie though, I never have this much bad luck ever, ever, ever, ever."</p>
      <p>Last night saw the series finale of game show Don't Hate The Playaz, on which Maya is a team captain.</p>

      <p>The ITV2 show, hosted by Jordan Stephens, pits Maya's team against the team of rapper Lady Leshurr.</p>
      <p>It recently became the first UK show to feature an all black, all female panel - Maya and Lady Leshurr were joined by Sabrina Washington, comedians London Hughes and Sophie Duker and rapper Ms Banks.</p>
      <p>Maya's been in the spotlight even more so than usual recently, after she split from grime legend Stormzy after four years of dating.</p>
      <p>She sparked rumours of a new romance with boxer Anthony Joshua after sharing a snap of the two together.</p>
      <p>"Working with this one today @anthonyfjoshua," she wrote.</p>
      <p>Later she added: "Right, so he's teaching me how to fight."</p>
      <p>Despite the fans in meltdown, Anthony shut down the rumours.</p>
