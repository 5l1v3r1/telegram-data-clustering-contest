      <p>ANCHORAGE, Ala. -- Anyone with unpaid parking fines at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) has the option to reduce the cost of their tickets with peanut butter and jelly.<br/><br/>The university says the PB&amp;J payments will benefit the local community to help combat student hunger and address food insecurity.<br/><br/><b>RELATED: <a href="https://abc7news.com/drivers-can-pay-parking-tickets-by-donating-school-supplies/5368610/">Las Vegas letting drivers pay parking tickets with school supplies donation</a></b><br/><br/>Two 16-ounce jars of peanut butter or jelly get a $10 credit, three jars are worth $35 and five jars get a $60 credit.<br/><br/>University officials say that any nut butter can be a substitute for peanut butter. Cashew butter, almond butter, and any flavor jam work as long as the jars are unopen.<br/><br/>The university is partnering with UAA Emergency Food Cache to accept PB&amp;J payments until Nov. 8.<br/><br/>For more information on the program, visit University of Alaska Anchorage's website<a href="https://www.uaa.alaska.edu/about/administrative-services/departments/business-services/parking/pbandj-drive.cshtml"> here</a>.</p>
