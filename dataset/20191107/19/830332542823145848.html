      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T19:06:14+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">Jacopo Prisco, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City has announced the theme of the 2020 Met Gala and the accompanying Costume Institute exhibition: "About Time: Fashion and Duration."</p>
      <p>The exhibition -- which will be part of the Met's 150th anniversary celebrations -- will trace the history of fashion from 1870 to the present, along what the museum calls a "disruptive timeline."</p>
      <p>Borrowing from philosopher Henri Bergson a concept called "la durée" -- time that flows, accumulates, and is indivisible -- the show will explore the connection between fashion and time through the lens of the writings of the late Virginia Woolf, which will act as a "ghost narrator." The catalogue will include a new short story by Michael Cunningham, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his novel, "The Hours," which was inspired by Woolf's "Mrs. Dalloway."</p>
      <p>The concept of time, therefore, will inform the sartorial choices of the fashion world's biggest night of the year, the annual invite-only gala fundraiser that is traditionally held before the exhibition opens. The exhibition itself will run from May 7 to Sept. 7, while the gala will be held the evening of May 4.</p>
      <p>"This exhibition will consider the ephemeral nature of fashion, employing flashbacks and fast-forwards to reveal how it can be both linear and cyclical," Max Hollein, director of the Met, said in a statement. "As such, the show will present a nuanced continuum of fashion over the Museum's 150-year history."</p>
      <p>"Fashion is indelibly connected to time," Andrew Bolton, curator of the exhibition, said in a statement. "It not only reflects and represents the spirit of the times, but it also changes and develops with the times, serving as an especially sensitive and accurate timepiece. Through a series of chronologies, the exhibition will use the concept of duration to analyze the temporal twists and turns of fashion history."</p>
      <p>Some 160 pieces will feature in the exhibition, and some will offer a connection between eras or generations. For example, a black silk faille princess-line dress from the late 1870s will be paired with an Alexander McQueen "Bumster" skirt from 1995. Famed British stage designer Es Devlin is in charge of the show's design.</p>
      <p>The gala will be co-chaired by Nicolas Ghesquière of Louis Vuitton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, and Anna Wintour.</p>
      <p>Last year's theme was camp, while the prior year's was Catholicism.</p>
