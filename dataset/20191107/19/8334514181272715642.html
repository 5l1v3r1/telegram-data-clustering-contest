      <p>PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Sunday, Macron’s office said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Macron will talk with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, then with the chancellor, ahead of a dinner attended by players and witnesses of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the statement said.</p>
      <p>The meeting will be an occasion to “reflect on the legacy of 1989 and the meaning of the European project, highlighting the importance of the Franco-German couple,” it said.</p>
      <p>Macron warned fellow European countries on Thursday that NATO is dying because of American unpredictability under President Donald Trump, a view quickly rejected by Germany.</p>
      <p>Macron used “drastic words” when he described NATO as experiencing a “brain death”, Merkel said on Thursday, saying that was not her view.</p>
