      <p>Russ Mantle, a retired civil servant, has recorded his mileage since he got his first bike in 1952.</p>
      <p>He has meticulously noted every ride as he cycled to work, participated in local races and pedaled up mountains in Europe and America.</p>
      <p>“It is just another milestone to pass a million and then on to one one, one two and so on. I should probably finish up close to 2,000,000 by the time I die when I am 100,” Mantle said.</p>
      <p>While it is unknown how many people may have cycled such a distance, Mantle is the first to register his mileage and have the proof.</p>
      <p>“I have always recorded things. Naturally, my brain tells me to record things, even my accidents. I have always done it and at my job I was keen on figures and I could convert from metric to English measurement quickly,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Englishman has had his fair share of scrapes.</p>
      <p>“I can remember other things very clearly despite me having been knocked off by cars, lorries and suffered concussion, three days in Southampton hospital through an accident with a lorry,” Mantle said.</p>
      <p>Nikola Marshall, director of UK Cycling, is hoping Mantle will encourage more Britons to get on their bikes.</p>
      <p>“Our mission is to get a million more people on bikes,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Lots of people have a bike in the shed or in the garage they maybe haven’t ridden for a while and we really hope that hearing Russ’ story and that he has cycled all the way to 82 will make people get back on their bikes.”</p>
