      <h1>Buyer of G.M. Lordstown Plant Promises Union Work and Wages</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:30:36+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Neal E. Boudette</a></address>
      <p>General Motors has sold its factory in Lordstown, Ohio, to a company that says it will make electric pickup trucks with union labor at wages comparable to those of the Detroit automakers.</p>
      <p>The price was not disclosed.</p>
      <p>The announcement on Thursday came less than two weeks after G.M.’s union workers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/business/gm-contract.html?module=inline">approved a new contract</a>, ending a strike in which the future of the factory, idled this year, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/business/gm-lordstown-strike.html?module=inline">was a central issue</a>.</p>
      <p>The buyer is Lordstown Motors, a start-up that says it plans to hire some 400 workers next year and start production of an electric pickup designed for commercial fleets.</p>
      <p>Steve Burns, the founder of Lordstown Motors, said the company would give preference in hiring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/01/magazine/lordstown-general-motors-plant.html?module=inline">the plant’s former G.M. workers</a>.</p>
      <p>“We think it is appropriate that it is union,” Mr. Burns said. “Our goal is to hire those folks first who have experience and are still in Lordstown.”</p>
      <p>Lordstown Motors expects to begin hiring workers next fall and start production by the end of 2020, Mr. Burns said. Workers will probably earn the top U.A.W. wage of about $31 an hour, he added. “We will be paying the same as the Big Three are paying,” Mr. Burns said.</p>
      <p>In a statement, G.M. said it believed that Lordstown Motors “has the potential to create a significant number of jobs and help the Lordstown area grow into a manufacturing hub” for electric vehicles.</p>
      <p>In its discussions with the U.A.W., G.M. prevailed in its determination to close the Lordstown plant, but it pledged to locate a battery factory in the area that would create about 1,000 jobs. The Lordstown plant, which most recently made the Chevrolet Cruze, once employed 3,000 workers.</p>
      <p>The U.A.W. did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the sale and the plans outlined by Mr. Burns.</p>
      <p>The pickup that Lordstown Motors says it will build was developed by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/business/economy/trump-gm-workhorse-lordstown.html?module=inline">Mr. Burns’s previous company</a>, Workhorse Group, based in Cincinnati. Mr. Burns left that business to start a venture to produce the electric pickup while Workhorse focused on an electric delivery truck.</p>
      <p>Lordstown Motors has orders for 6,000 trucks from Duke Energy and 18 other companies that operate large fleets, Mr. Burns said.</p>
      <p>Financing for the factory purchase was provided by Brown Gibbons Lang &amp; Company, an investment bank based in Cleveland. Lordstown Motors said that with the bank’s help, it hoped to recruit strategic investors as it builds a new assembly line at the plant</p>
