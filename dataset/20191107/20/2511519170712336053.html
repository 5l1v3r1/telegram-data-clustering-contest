      <p>Anti-government protesters have reportedly attacked a mayor from a small Bolivian town, covering her in red paint and cutting her hair.</p>
      <p>Patricia Arce, a member of the ruling Mas party, was dragged barefoot through the streets by demonstrators before being taken away by the police.</p>
      <p>The Vinto mayor was also forced to sign a resignation letter and the town hall was set on fire, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-50332167?ocid=socialflow_twitter">the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Crowds were blocking a bridge near Vinto, a town in the Cochabamba department which has seen demonstrations since the disputed presidential election on 20 October.</p>
      <p>After hearing rumours two anti-government protesters had been killed nearby, a crowd marched to the town hall, <i><a href="https://www.lostiempos.com/actualidad/pais/20191106/liberan-alcaldesa-vinto-agredirla-violentamente">Los Tiempos</a> </i>newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>They got hold of the mayor, dragged her through the streets and attacked her while shouting “murderer”, according to reports.</p>
      <p>One of the rumoured deaths was later confirmed, the BBC said. </p>
      <p>Limbert Guzman, a 20-year-old student, is the third person to die following street clashes between supporters of the Bolivian president <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/evo-morales">Evo Morales</a> and opposition protesters.</p>
      <p>Mr Morales called the young man an “innocent victim of violence provoked by political groups encouraging racial hatred amongst our Bolivian brothers” on Twitter. </p>
      <p>Protests have been ongoing for the three weeks following the last election in which Mr Morales, who has been president since 2006, was victorious.</p>
      <p>His win was marred by almost a 24-hour halt in the count, which then showed a sharp increase in support for Mr Morales once resumed.</p>

      <p>International governments have called for calm and are backing an audit of the election by the Organisation of American States (OAS), which has recommended that a second round vote go ahead. Mr Morales has agreed the audit will be “binding.”</p>
      <p>The OAS has called for calm while it completes its audit.</p>
      <p>Since the vote, cities have gone into lockdown, with daily marches and road blocks.</p>
      <p>A Bolivian protest leader who has become a symbol of opposition to President Evo Morales has arrived in the nation’s capital, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/la-paz">La Paz</a>, where he plans to formally demand the leftist leader step down after a contentious election last month.</p>
      <p>Luis Fernando Camacho, a civic leader from Santa Cruz, plans to march to the presidential palace with a pre-written letter of resignation for Mr Morales to sign.</p>
