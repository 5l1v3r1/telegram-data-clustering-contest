      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is demanding Republican legislators vote on a pair of bills restricting firearm ownership.</p>
      <p>Evers in October ordered a special legislative session on gun control to begin Tuesday afternoon. He wants to them to vote on bills mandating universal background checks and allowing family members or police to ask judges to temporarily seize firearms from people who pose a threat.</p>

      <p>Republican leaders say they won't even consider the bills. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says he plans to gavel in and gavel out seconds later, ending the session.</p>
      <p>Evers sent Fitzgerald and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos a letter Thursday morning blasting them for "ignoring the will of the people" and demanding they vote on the proposals. He says Wisconsin residents deserve to know where their legislators stand on the bills.</p>

      <p>Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is accusing Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of "playing politics" by calling a special session on gun control.</p>
      <p>Vos said the Assembly will not debate or vote on the bills Thursday in the special session. He plans to gavel in and quickly adjourn the session. </p>
      <p>"I don't necessarily want to spend a bunch of time playing politics with this which is what it seems our Democratic colleagues want to do," Vos said. </p>
      <p>Democrats say Republicans should pass universal background checks and a "red flag" law in part because polls show broad public support.</p>
      <p>Vos said Republicans won't support the bills because they infringe upon Second Amendment gun rights.</p>
