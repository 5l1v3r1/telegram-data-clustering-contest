      <h1>Man City backed to beat Liverpool - by man who played for Blues last time they won at Anfield</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: It's been over 16 years since City last took three points from Anfield - but Niclas Jensen reckons that run will come to an end on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>The last time ­Manchester City won at Anfield, Busted were at No.1, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tony-blair">Tony Blair</a> was Prime Minister, and Pep Guardiola was still ­playing.</p>
      <p>In May 2003, two late goals from Nicolas Anelka sealed a 2-1 win, a first victory for City at Anfield for 22 years, denying the Reds a place in the ­Champions League.</p>
      <p>City have failed to win at Anfield on 18 subsequent visits, 16 in the league, a miserable run Guardiola’s side will look to end on Sunday to cut <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s six-point lead and reignite the title race.</p>
      <p>Niclas Jensen, who played for City that day, reckons Guardiola’s side can win at Anfield and claimed ­Liverpool could ultimately choke with the pressure of trying to end their 30-year wait for the title.</p>
      <p>The former Denmark ­international, who now works as a football agent, said: “I still think City have the better team and better players. But you have to say Liverpool have been looking really strong this season.</p>

      <p>“So, it’s going to be a tough game. But I hope and think City are going to win there this time.</p>
      <p>“Liverpool are out in front in the title race, but I still see City doing it again, ­especially because – and you’ve seen before – it’s also mind games.</p>
      <p>"If City can ­narrow the gap and not let it get any bigger, all of a ­sudden, come February and March, when the more ­decisive games come up, it will be a mental thing.</p>
      <p>“People will start writing about it and talking about it – ‘Can it happen again?’ and ‘Will Liverpool choke now?’</p>

      <h3>Where are they now? The City XI that last won at Anfield</h3>
      <p>Peter Schmeichel – Retired in 2003, now a pundit and brand ambassador</p>
      <p>David Sommeil – Forced to stop playing in 2008 following a heart attack.</p>
      <p>Richard Dunne – Retired in 2015, recently finished A-Licence coaching badge.</p>
      <p>Sylvain Distin – Retrained as a strength and conditioning coach after retiring.</p>
      <p>Niclas Jensen – Now works as a football agent all over Europe.</p>
      <p>Kevin Horlock – Manager at Needham Market Academy in Suffolk.</p>
      <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips – Went on to play in the MLS, retired this year.</p>
      <p>Ali Benarbia – Works as a consultant for sports broadcasters in France.</p>
      <p>Joey Barton – Manager of League One side Fleetwood Town.</p>
      <p>Robbie Fowler – Head coach of Australian A-League team Brisbane Roar.</p>
      <p>Nicolas Anelka – Currently a youth coach with French club Lille.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Then, I think City will do it again, if there’s not too much of a points deficit.”</p>
      <p>While Anelka’s goals sealed the win for City, ­Jensen’s abiding memory was a world-class save from Peter Schmeichel, playing his penultimate game before retiring.</p>
      <p>“I remember it was a ­really good team performance,” said Jensen. “Nicolas scored both goals, one right at the end. But the one thing that I remember most was an amazing save from Peter.</p>
      <p>"It’s stayed with me all these years, because it’s probably the best save I’ve ever seen in a game I’ve played.</p>

      <p>“I know Peter well, he’s one of my mates. He was 39 or 40 at that time and it was a world-class save which made him look like a 22-year-old!</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s one particular reason why City haven’t won at Anfield for so long.</p>
      <p>“Even though teams change and certain players come and go, with certain grounds, certain sides, it’s always difficult to go there, and that’s the case for City at Anfield.”</p>
      <p>Richard Dunne, who was also in that last City team to win at Anfield, reckons his former club would settle for a draw on Sunday, given their poor record there.</p>
      <p>“For City, it’s so important they don’t fall further behind Liverpool,” said Dunne, who is living in the South of France and who has just completed his A-Licence coaching badge.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure for them, with the injuries they’ve got and the fact Liverpool are so strong at home, a draw would be a good result for City.</p>
      <p>“The intensity Liverpool play at when they’re at home, particularly with the crowd behind them, makes them so difficult to play against.</p>
      <p>“When we won there back then, you wouldn’t have thought City would go 16 years without doing it again, but sometimes you get those unlucky grounds.</p>
      <p>“City have progressed so much since then, but ­Liverpool have come back in the last few years and ­become stronger and stronger, and now present a real challenge to City.”</p>
