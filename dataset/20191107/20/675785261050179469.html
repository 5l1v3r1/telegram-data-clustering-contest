      <h1>Girl, 7, almost blinded after horrific mauling by crazed German Shepherd</h1>
      <h2>WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Sophie Evans, from Wombwell, South Yorkshire, was left with her skull part exposed after the gruesome attack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:24:53+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A seven-year-old girl was left with part of her skull exposed and almost blinded after a crazed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/dangerous-dogs">German Shepherd</a> attacked her.</p>
      <p>Sophie Evans was covered in blood and had bite wounds across her face and scalp after the mauling.</p>
      <p>She had injuries so deep the bones were exposed on her head.</p>
      <p>Her grief-stricken mum Lyndsey, 34, said: "I was heartbroken when I saw her.</p>
      <p>"Nothing can prepare you for being on the other side as a parent."</p>
      <p>Sophie was dashed to A&amp;E but then transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital's emergency department.</p>
      <p>The youngster, of Wombwell, South Yorkshire,  was treated by the emergency team before spending four-and-a-half hours in surgery the next morning.</p>

      <p>She was discharged two days later and returned to school within three weeks in January.</p>
      <p>Lyndsey, herself a receptionist in a hospital emergency department, continued: "To this day, I cannot believe how brave she was when I arrived, she just held out her hand and said 'mummy, I'm OK'.</p>
      <p>"I'm used to seeing people on their worst days but nothing can prepare you for being on the other side as a parent.</p>
      <p>"All the staff who helped us were absolutely amazing, words will never be enough to explain how forever grateful we will be.</p>

      <p>"On the worst day of our lives, they made sure we were all looked after and reassured.</p>
      <p>"Thanks to the magic hands of the emergency department team, her scars are barely noticeable today. They fixed my Sophie up and she is perfect to us once again."</p>
      <p>The family has now devoted themselves to fundraising for The Children's Hospital Charity's £4.5 million appeal to build a new emergency department at Sheffield Children's Hospital.</p>

      <p>Jack has already begun the effort, running his first-ever 10K alongside his dad - security officer Rob, 37 - and raising £800 towards the appeal.</p>
      <p>David Vernon-Edwards, director of The Children's Hospital Charity, said the emergency department was built to see a maximum of 32,000 patients every year but last year saw almost 57,000.</p>
      <p>In addition to the expanded waiting room and clinical space, the redevelopment will also build a dedicated space for children with mental health issues or learning difficulties and a separate area for adolescents.</p>
      <p>Mr Vernon-Edwards said: "We're so thankful to Sophie's family for sharing their story and to her brother, Jack, for his fantastic fundraising."</p>
