      <h1>Actress Adèle Haenel Accuses French Director of Sexually Harassing Her As a Teen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:22:58+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/tiff-is-falling-hard-for-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire.html"><i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i></a> actress Adèle Haenel has come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against French director Christophe Ruggia. Haenel told news site <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/france/051119/french-actress-adele-haenel-accuses-filmmaker-sexual-harassment-when-minor">Mediapart</a> that the alleged abuse occurred when she was a young girl, and that she didn’t think to come forward until after she watched <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-hbo-review.html"><i>Leaving Neverland</i></a>, an HBO documentary about child-sexual-abuse allegations against Michael Jackson. “It made me see I had too long clung to the version of Christophe Ruggia, that it had all been a story of love,” she told Mediapart. “It made me understand the mechanisms of control and fascination.”</p>
      <p>Haenel and Ruggia met when she was cast in his film <i>Les Diables</i> (The Devils). She was 12 years old and he was 36. “[Ruggia] put a system in place to isolate me, to have me at his place every weekend,” she explained. “It was a man of nearly 40 who every week got himself into a room with a young girl who was between 12 and 15 and tried to touch her up. There was no ambiguity in the situation … it wasn’t romantic, it was pure pressure. I was stuck to the sofa. I froze in the centre of all this.”</p>
      <p>Mediapart spoke to dozens of witnesses over seven months — including those who worked on <i>Les Diables</i>, a film about two 12-year-old siblings’ incestuous relationship — who expressed concern for Ruggia’s treatment of Haenel. At 15, Haenel says she tried to cut off contact with Ruggia, with little help from his entourage. The two-time César Award winner refuses to file a police complaint due to the “contempt with which the judicial system treats women.” However, a <a href="https://www.mediapart.fr/en/journal/france/071119/paris-prosecutors-launch-probe-actress-adele-haenels-paedophilia-accusations-against-filmmaker">public prosecutor</a> has opened an investigation into “sexual aggression on a minor carried out by someone in authority,” according to Mediapart. Ruggia has also been expelled from the French film directors’ guild. In a statement to the news site, Ruggia denied the allegations, saying that he and Haenel had a “professional and affectionate” relationship. On November 6, he published a <a href="https://www.screendaily.com/news/director-christophe-ruggia-issues-denial-of-adele-haenel-accusations-as-investigation-opens/5144475.article">letter</a> saying, “I had boundless admiration for her love of cinema and the talent I had detected in her, and was offended that many of the people around me didn’t see what I saw in her.”</p>
      <p>“You have to recognize it, it is more violence denying it,” Haenel said in a livestreamed interview with Mediapart. “And I am even more shocked by the fact that he says he discovered me, because really he destroyed me.” </p>
