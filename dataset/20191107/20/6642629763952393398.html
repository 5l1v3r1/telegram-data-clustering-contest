      <p>Members of slain ISIL chief <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/abu-bakr-al-baghdadi.html">Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</a>'s inner circle are trying to enter <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a> from <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a>, President <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/people/recep-tayyip-erdogan.html">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</a> said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The number of people with family ties to al-Baghdadi who have been caught by Turkey "is close to reaching double digits", Erdogan added.</p>
      <p>The Turkish leader's comments were his second effort in as many days to publicise his country's push to catch Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/isis-isil.html">ISIL</a> or ISIS) members who were close to al-Baghdadi.</p>
      <p>"All of al-Baghdadi's inner circle is mostly targeting our country and these people are looking for ways to settle in our country or to come to our country," Erdogan told reporters.</p>
      <p>He and Turkish officials said on Wednesday that Turkish police detained one of al-Baghdadi's wives and a daughter last year.</p>
      <p>A Turkish official told The Associated Press they were among a group of 11 ISIL suspects detained in a raid in southern Turkey on June 2, 2018.</p>
      <p>Police identified the wife as Asma Fawzi Muhammad al-Qubaysi. The official said she was the first wife of al-Baghdadi, who is known to have four wives.</p>
      <p>A subsequent DNA test confirmed a suspect who identified herself as Leila Jabeer was al-Baghdadi's daughter, the official said.</p>
      <h3>A major blow </h3>
      <p>Turkish authorities said they captured al-Baghdadi's elder sister, Rasmiya Awad, her husband, daughter-in-law and five children in the town of Azaz, in Aleppo province in northwestern Syria.</p>
      <p>The region is administered by Turkey following a previous military campaign that was launched in 2016.</p>
      <p>Erdogan said the suspects were being kept in detention centres in Turkey while the justice ministry decides how to handle their cases.</p>
      <p>Al-Baghdadi blew himself up during an October 26 raid by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">US</a> special forces on his heavily fortified safe-house in the Syrian province of Idlib. The raid was a major blow to his armed group, which has lost territory it held in Syria and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html">Iraq</a> in a series of military defeats.</p>
      <p>Also Thursday, Erdogan said attacks continued in northeast Syria by Kurdish forces targeting either Turkish troops or their Syrian opposition allies, despite two separate truces brokered by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/russia.html">Russia</a> and the US last month, which halted Turkey's military offensive.</p>
      <p>At least 11 Syrian opposition fighters were killed in an attack on Thursday, Erdogan said, without specifying where or how it occurred.</p>
      <p>The Turkish leader said Wednesday a total of 144 Syrian opposition fighters and 10 Turkish soldiers were killed during Turkey's military operation into northeast Syria, which began on October 9.</p>
