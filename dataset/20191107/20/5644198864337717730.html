      <p>REUTERS: Former England captain and Northampton Saints hooker Dylan Hartley announced his retirement on Thursday after failing to recover from a knee injury that cost him a place in the Rugby World Cup squad.</p>
      <p>Hartley, 33, led England to back-to-back Six Nations triumphs in 2016 and 2017 but has not played since suffering the injury while representing club side Northampton against Worcester in December.</p>

      <p>New Zealand-born Hartley was left out of Eddie Jones' 31-man squad which finished runners-up to South Africa in the recently concluded World Cup in Japan.</p>
      <p>"The last few months have been difficult mentally and physically as I've come to terms with the fact that I am no longer able to compete," Hartley said.</p>
      <p>"I'm extremely proud of my journey, both with Saints and representing England, but now is the right time to hang up my playing boots."</p>
      <p>Hartley ends his career as England's second most capped player with 97 test caps - behind only former prop Jason Leonard who ended his career with 114 caps - and more than 250 appearances for the Saints.</p>
      <p>"I have loved my journey in rugby. I came to England as a teenager hoping to get a few games of rugby and to see the world," Hartley added.</p>
      <p>"I could have never have predicted that one day I'd play 14 years for such a special club and go on to represent and captain England."</p>
