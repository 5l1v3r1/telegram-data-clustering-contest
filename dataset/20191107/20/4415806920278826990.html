      <p>A judge has ordered President Donald Trump to pay two million US dollars to settle a lawsuit alleging he misused his charitable foundation to further his political and business interests.</p>
      <p>New York judge Saliann Scarpulla also signed off on an agreement to close the Trump Foundation and distribute about 1.7 million US dollars in remaining funds to other nonprofit groups.</p>
      <p>A request for comment was emailed to Mr Trump’s lawyer.</p>

      <p>New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit last year alleging Mr Trump and his family illegally operated the foundation as an extension of his businesses and his presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>New York attorney general Letitia James had been seeking about 2.8 million US dollars in restitution from the president.</p>
      <p>Ms Scarpulla cut that amount to two million US dollars.</p>
