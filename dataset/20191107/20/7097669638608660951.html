      <h1>Could China's Robots Take Over The South China Sea?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:33:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Robert Beckhusen</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>China hopes that robots will give it an asymmetric advantage over the United States.</p>
      <p>A video from late May 2018 shows a swarm of <a href="http://news.dwnews.com/china/news/2018-05-30/60061288.html">56 small, unmanned boats</a> operating in the South China Sea. While a rudimentary demonstration, it mirrors similar exercises performed by U.S. Navy boats practicing — semi-autonomously — to defend harbors and intercept incoming vessels.</p>
      <p>The Chinese robo-boats do not appear to be armed, but the company behind it — Yunzhou Tech Corporation — revealed an <a href="https://www.popsci.com/china-world-largest-facility-robot-ship-research">armed unmanned boat</a> at a Beijing “Civil-Military Integration Expo” in July 2017.</p>
      <p>The show focused on cutting-edge technologies that China believes could provide an “asymmetric” advantage in a conflict with the United States. Meaning, cheaper technologies and tactics that allow a weaker adversary to exploit unanticipated weaknesses in a more powerful opponent.</p>
      <p>If the at-sea demonstration is any sign, those capabilities are developing.</p>
      <p>The expensive and difficult portion of a robotic swarm is the technology you can’t see — the networks and algorithms that allow machines to work together and avoid obstacles. The boats themselves are cheap.</p>
      <p>Once you figure out the mathematical problems, then it’s a simple matter of arming each of those small boats with rockets and missiles and sending them after a $1 billion cruiser. Like a swarm of mosquitoes, the cruiser can’t swat them all away before one draws blood.</p>
      <p>However, the Chinese military is not entirely sold on the concept, as there are more conservative-minded generals who prefer the People’s Liberation Army focus on improving and expanding its conventional, and established, military forces — warships, fighter jets and missiles — as opposed to taking risks on largely untried technology.</p>
      <p>But Chinese companies are still developing drones, and the armed Wing Loong — similar to the U.S. Predator — has proliferated to Africa where it has <a href="http://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2017/02/27/The-story-of-the-Wing-Loong-drone-and-the-Egyptian-battle-against-ISIS-in-Sinai.html">seen combat</a>. A more anodyne set of examples of developing Chinese drone tech are the dancing displays of networked machines taking to the skies during public events.</p>
