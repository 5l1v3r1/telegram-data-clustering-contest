      <h1>PML-N to continue to offer lip service for sit-in</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T20:00:09+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/1602/rameez-khan/" target="_blank">Rameez Khan</a></address>
      <p><b>LAHORE: </b>Despite Nawaz Sharif’s promise to extend all-out support to Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s ‘Azadi march’, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) would only continue to verbally back the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F’s) sit-in, senior party leaders said.</p>
      <p>Even Maryam Nawaz, who has always towed her father’s line, would not participate in the sit-in, party sources added.</p>
      <p>Maryam’s secretary and a senior a party leader said that she would not resume any political activities to solely focus on her father’s health.</p>
      <p>They said that Maryam did not get a chance to accompany her mother when she was ill. So given Nawaz’s health condition, she would spare no time for anything else.</p>
      <p>The leaders further said if their party was not a part of the sit-in, it also did not want to leave Maulana alone at this juncture.</p>
      <p>“Maulana is out fighting for the entire opposition parties. We may not agree with his route but we surely share all his concerns and back all his demands,” they said.</p>
      <p>“Leaving Maulana on his own will strengthen the government and will not go in the favour of any opposition party. PML-N will keep its token presence,” they added.</p>
      <p>Other leaders maintained that PML-N was the party in waiting which would take the reins of government and so it did not want to set any wrong trend for others to follow.</p>
      <p>The PML-N stalwarts observed that they would want to pursue the idea of an in-house change for which pressure could be exerted through democratic means.</p>
      <p>They said that before leaving Maulana would give his road map for further protests.</p>
      <p>PML-N Lahore President Pervaiz Malik said that his party was keeping its word of supporting the movement.</p>
      <p>Malik declared that he was not aware of JUI-F’s plan of ending the sit-in but hoped that an understanding would soon be reached.</p>
