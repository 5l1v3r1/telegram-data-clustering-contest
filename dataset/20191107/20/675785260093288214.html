      <p>A woman who spoke out after a man tapped her on the shoulder in a queue in Pret a Manger has been supported by others who say there is never any reason to touch someone you don't know.</p>
      <p>The comment online by Katy Davies has sparked a flurry of posts from women fed-up with men trying to "herd them" or strangers touching them in the street.</p>
      <p>Katy, from London, said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "A man just tapped me on the shoulder from behind in the queue in Pret to point me to the free till I was already on my way to. I said this to him and I'll say it to anyone who needs to hear it: 'Stop trying to herd women.'"</p>
      <p>And Katy is clearly not the only one who feels this way, reports <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7661001/Women-SLAM-strangers-touching-public-react-fury-men-herding-them.html">Mail Online</a> .</p>
      <p>Laura, from Aberdeen, tweeted: "When you just about have a meltdown because a stranger touched your knee in the middle of the street...and then you realise it was actually a dog's nose."</p>

      <p>Another Twitter user, Emma Jane, said she could find "no reason" a stranger should touch someone they don't know.</p>
      <p>She Tweeted: "Second day in a row a stranger has approached me and touched me on the street. THERE IS ACTUALLY NO REASON TO TOUCH SOMEONE YOU DONT KNOW. Is there a way to say this more plainly?"</p>
      <p>Anna Fearon tweeted about her own encounter, where a man touched knee on a train to "get her attention".</p>
      <p>She wrote: "A few weeks ago, I was sitting on the train and the man opposite me felt the need to touch my knee to get my attention to move my bag."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She used the hashtag  #EverydaySexism in her tweet.</p>
      <p>Responses have come from all over the world with New York resident Lauren Cox, from New York, expressing her irritation at someone touching her when she was wearing headphones.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "When you can't hear someone talking to you because you are wearing headphones so they touch you.</p>
      <p>"Why? Does no one else have ears or answers?  Am I the one sole person left to help you? Please don't touch me with your stranger fingers. Bye."</p>
      <p>Londoner Rose Stokes called out the mansplaining of two random men on the tube, who felt the need to tell her how she should wrap something.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She wrote: "Today in the latest episode of the patriarchy, I was doing my wraps for boxing on the tube, when two men I didn't know and who also didn't know each other felt the need to tap me and mansplain wrapping to me. I'd almost finished at this point."</p>
      <p>And Manchester woman Holly had to stick up for herself when a man put his hand on her lower back to "hurry me up" during the evening commute.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "I remember one Friday night, getting on a train at Manchester Piccadilly quite late in the evening and the guy behind me felt I wasn't moving quick enough so put his hand on my lower back to hurry me up. I turned around and loudly told him to get his hands off me.</p>
      <p>"He jumped back, I don't think he expected a reaction. Then I got the typical reply of 'Calm down' and 'you're overreacting'. He'd been drinking (not an excuse) and was with a friend and I think his ego was bruised."   </p>
