      <h1>Apple Shares Featurette on the Creation of Apple TV+ Show 'See'</h1>

      <p>Apple this evening shared a behind the scenes look on how the world behind one of its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ shows, "See," was created. <br/><br/>"See" is one of the ‌Apple TV‌+ launch shows, starring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard. It features a postapocalyptic setting where much of the world has been wiped out by a virus, and the survivors are all blind.</p>

      <p>Enough time has passed that sight has become a myth, and it is forbidden to speak of, though two children are born with the capability. <br/><br/>The video features Francis Lawrence, who directed the series, talking about how the buildings and environments in "See" were constructed. The "See" crew had a team of advisors who are blind providing instruction on everything from how buildings would be built to how people would live and interact. <br/><br/>‌Apple TV‌+ is available for $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year, but Apple has also made it available for free to everyone who purchased an ‌Apple TV‌, Mac, iPhone, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipod-touch/">iPod touch</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> after September 10, 2019.</p>
