        <b><i>Paris, France, Nov 7 – </i>Vaping devices and the chemicals they deliver — increasingly popular among teens — may damage the cardiovascular system, a study said Thursday, adding to a growing chorus of concern over injury and deaths related to e-cigarettes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest findings, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, come after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month declared an “outbreak of lung injuries” linked to vaping.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“E-cigarettes contain nicotine, particulate matter, metal and flavourings, not just harmless water vapour,” senior author Loren Wold of Ohio State University wrote in Thursday’s study.</p>
      <p>“Air pollution studies show that fine particles enter the circulation and have direct effects on the heart — data for e-cigarettes are pointing in that direction.”</p>
      <p>Nicotine, also found in tobacco, is known to increase blood pressure and the heart rate.</p>
      <p>But other ingredients inhaled through the vaping may lead to inflammation, oxidative stress and unstable blood flow, Wold said.</p>
      <p>Ultrafine particulate, for example, has been linked to thrombosis, coronary heart disease and hypertension, among other conditions.</p>
      <p>E-cigarettes also contain formaldehyde, which has been classified as a cancer-causing agent and associated with heart damage in experiments with rats.</p>
      <p>Moreover, almost nothing is known about the potential health hazards of flavouring agents that mimic the taste of mint, candy or fruits such as mango or cherry, the study noted.</p>
      <p>“While most are deemed safe when ingested orally, little is known of their systemic effects following inhalation,” the researchers wrote.</p>
      <p>To assess possible impacts on the heart and vascular system, Wold and colleagues undertook a systematic review of medical literature, which remains thin due to the newness of e-cigarette use.</p>
      <p>– Teens ‘not getting the message’ –</p>
      <p>Wold noted that most studies to date have focused on the acute effects of e-cigarette use rather than the risk of chronic use.</p>
      <p>Also, little is known about the secondhand effects of vaping, as well as exposure to particles lodged in walls, drapes and clothing.</p>
      <p>Thirty-seven deaths in 24 states have been linked to e-cigarette and vaping products as of October 29, according to the CDC. There were nearly 1,900 cases of associated lung injury nationwide.</p>
      <p>In the majority of cases, persons affected also used the devices to consume products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, raising the possibility that unknown impurities were also present.</p>
      <p>The CDC discourages non-smokers from starting to use e-cigarettes and suggests individuals trying to kick a tobacco habit use alternatives approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), such as patches and gums.</p>
      <p>But the popularity of vaping has skyrocketed since the devices were introduced to the US and European markets just over a decade ago.</p>
      <p>Vaping users increased from seven million worldwide in 2011 to 41 million in 2018, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
      <p>The products are particularly appealing to young users — often by design, according to critics.</p>
      <p>One in four high school students in the United States uses e-cigarettes, up more than 15 percent from two years ago, according to the 2019 National Youth Tobacco Study.</p>
      <p>Use by preteens doubled from 2018 to 2019, with 10 percent of middle school students admitted to vaping.</p>
      <p>“Adults are beginning to get the message that the full health effects of vaping are unknown, and the risk is potentially very high,” said Wold.</p>
      <p>“My fear is that has not been crystallised in adolescents.”</p>
