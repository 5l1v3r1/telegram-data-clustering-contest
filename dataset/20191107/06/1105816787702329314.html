      <h1>Hundreds protest corruption in Kuwait</h1>

      <p><b>KUWAIT CITY: </b>Hundreds protested in front of Kuwait’s parliament on Wednesday evening against the state’s perceived unwillingness to fight corruption, in a country where such events have periodically triggered political crises.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators called on speaker of parliament Marzouq al-Ghanim to step down.</p>
      <p>“Resign! Resign, Marzouq, the Kuwaiti people don’t want you!”, they chanted.</p>
      <p>Other lawmakers have accused the speaker of corruption.</p>
      <p>The protesters had been mobilised by former lawmaker Saleh al-Moulla, who used social media to call for a vigil, organised with permission from authorities, under the slogan “That’s enough!”</p>
      <p>Moulla told journalists that the mobilisation was “a message from the people and an expression of the unhappiness of the people in the face of corruption.”</p>
      <p>The demonstration came amid huge popular protest movements against corruption in Lebanon and Kuwait’s neighbour Iraq.</p>
      <p>“We want our government to stop stealing public money,” protester Ahmed al-Douwaihi told <i>AFP</i>. “They have stolen our hopes and dreams.”</p>
      <p>Another protester, Abderrahman Hassan Al-Otaibi, said “we want stability in our country.”</p>
      <p>For lawyer and human rights advocate Mohammed al-Houmaidi, the initiative “is not led by any political movement, but by the population themselves who have come to flag their problems with housing, health and education”.</p>
