      <p>A mum died of bladder cancer after she was wrongly treated for urinary infections for two years.</p>
      <p>Margaret Beaton, 51, was finally diagnosed with cancer in March but after despite two operations, chemotherapy and radiotherapy she died six months later.</p>
      <p>Her heartbroken eldest daughter Vikki, 30, said her mum felt “cheated” by her shortened life, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tragic-mum-treated-urine-infections-20828219">the Daily Record reports</a> .</p>
      <p>Margaret’s husband Craig, 51, said: “She was given antibiotics for two years without having any scans.</p>
      <p>“Doctors went down the infection route. We were told her symptoms were wear and tear when it was cancer.”</p>

      <p>In February, mum-of-three Margaret pushed for further examination and was diagnosed with bladder cancer.</p>
      <p>Later scans showed it had spread to her spinal cord and liver.</p>
      <p>In May, she had an operation at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow to remove her bladder and womb, which she hoped would save her life.</p>
      <p>Vikki said: “We were told the worst-case scenario would be that she would have to use a urostomy bag but she would have a good quality of life.”</p>

      <p>Instead, Margaret spent a week in intensive care and another 14 weeks in hospital.</p>
      <p>Vikki added: “She felt cheated. She had the operation to give her more time and a quality of life.”</p>
      <p>Margaret, who had worked as a pub manager and for Amazon, was cared for in Inverclyde Royal Hospital before going home on September 10, where she died in mechanic Craig’s arms two days later.</p>
      <p>About 1,000 people attended her funeral.</p>
      <p>Vikki said: “My dad feels he has lost half of himself – they were together 31 years.”</p>

      <p>Margaret also left behind Craig, 26, and Amy-Leigh, 16.</p>
      <p>Despite questions over the time taken to get a diagnosis, the family have not lodged a complaint with the NHS and spoke of their gratitude at the care Margaret received.</p>
      <p>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde yesterday said it “would be happy to discuss any issues” with Margaret’s family.</p>
