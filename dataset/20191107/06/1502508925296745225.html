      <p>Top Indian airline <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/indigo">IndiGo </a>said on Thursday it signed a one-way codeshare agreement with Qatar Airways, letting the Middle Eastern airline get more access to the fast-growing Indian market.</p>

      <p>The airline had once shunned codeshare deals to help keep costs low in line with its budget carrier model but changed its strategy as it grew to become the dominant airline in the Indian market and looked to grow international capacity.</p>
