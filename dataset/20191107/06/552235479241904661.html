      <h1>Rugby: East Kilbride boss calls on side to seize Murrayfield chance</h1>
      <h2>Allan Steel's men tackle local rivals Strathaven in Saturday's West Regional semi-final</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T06:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Allan Steel has called on his depleted East Kilbride side to seize a rare chance to play at Murrayfield.</p>
      <p>The Torrance House boss will lead the team into the West Regional Shield semi-final against local rivals Strathaven on Saturday, but a number of key players are likely to miss the clash at Whiteshawgate Park.</p>
      <p>Prop Ally Marriot has already been ruled out after breaking his hand in a win away at Irvine last month, while Chris O’Neil, Scott Shankie and Robbie Greenfield could also be absent.</p>
      <p>Steel said: “I’ve said to the boys that you don’t get many chances to get to Murrayfield, so this is a big opportunity for them.</p>
      <p>“But we know it will be difficult. We picked up a lot of injuries in the last game, so we had seven missing from training last week and two or three of them are doubts or ruled out for the weekend.</p>
      <p>“Chris has done his hamstring, Scott has an ankle problem, Robbie has an issue with his calf and Ally broke his hand. There’s players with niggles as well.</p>
      <p>"It’s not ideal, but I’m still confident we can put out a strong side.”</p>

      <p>The winners of the tie will face either Allan Glens or Cambuslang in the final at the home of Scottish Rugby next month.</p>
      <p>Strathaven are top of West Region Division Two, while EK go in as favourites for the tie as they sit fourth in the division above.</p>
      <p>And Steel is determined to come through the tie, having set his sights on lifting the shield before the season kicked-off.</p>
      <p>He added: “We targeted this trophy at the start of the season and we are in a good position, but nobody remembers the team that gets to the semi-finals.</p>

      <p>“People remember the team that goes on and wins it and that’s our aim.</p>
      <p>“Strathaven will want to win it just as much as us, so we’ve got to make sure we do the right things to get there.</p>
      <p>“Strathaven are a good young side. They are top of their league and scoring a lot of points so we will have to be on it defensively.”</p>
      <p>The clash kicks-off at 1.30pm.</p>
