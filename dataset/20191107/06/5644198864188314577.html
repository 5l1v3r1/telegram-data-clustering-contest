      <p>Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday, sending its shares up 6per cent in extended trading.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Baidu Inc reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit and revenue as more people signed up with the company's video streaming platform iQIYI , sending the Chinese search engine company's shares up 5per cent after market.</p>
      <p>Baidu has been trying to cut its dependence on its core search business, which accounts for three-quarters of the company's revenue. The company has had limited success so far with its cloud services and artificial intelligence businesses, but its listed subsidiary iQIYI, a Netflix-like video service, is popular with young people.</p>

      <p>Third-quarter revenue from iQIYI, which competes with Alibaba-backed Youku and Tencent Holdings' Tencent Video, rose nearly 7per cent from a year earlier to 7.4 billion yuan (US$1.06 billion), as the service crossed 105.8 million subscribers in September. IQIYI's shares rose 4per cent in extended trading.</p>
      <p>A relatively new bet - offering mini-programmes within the Baidu App to boost traffic - is gathering steam as well. Traffic to the app surged 25per cent in the third quarter, the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The changes we initiated this year are paying off," Baidu Chief Executive Robin Li said in an internal letter reviewed by Reuters.</p>
      <p>But revenue from Baidu's core business fell 3per cent in the quarter ended Sept. 30, weighing on overall sales that were flat from a year earlier at 28.08 billion yuan but ahead of the analyst estimate of 27.49 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
      <p>Baidu reported a net loss of 6.37 billion yuan in the quarter mainly due to losses from the company's equity investments, versus a profit of 12.40 billion yuan a year earlier.</p>
      <p>Excluding these losses and other one-time items, Baidu earned 12.61 yuan per American depository share (ADS), beating estimates of 7.88 yuan per ADS.</p>
      <p>Baidu, like other Chinese internet companies, is dealing with tightening regulation even as the overall economy slows.</p>
      <p>These issues were for now weighing on Baidu's revenue, Li said on a post-earnings call.</p>
      <p>"These things, I think, will be temporary and we also think that the macro environment is stabilising. We do think that eventually revenue will catch up with traffic," he said.</p>
      <p>Baidu, whose search engine dominates the market in China, forecast fourth-quarter revenue between 27.10 billion yuan and 28.70 billion yuan. Analysts expect 27.52 billion yuan.</p>
      <p>The company's ADS, which have lost nearly a third of their value this year, were up about 5per cent at US$112.74 in extended trading.</p>
