      <p>Like anybody, I’m a sucker for a gorgeous, good vibes–y crystal. But due to said prettiness, it can be easy to forget to ask the tough questions. Like, <i>um, how do they work? Do they work? How much should I spend on one?</i> Also, there are just So. Many. Crystals. How do I pick the best one for me?</p>
      <p>So I asked one of our resident astrologers, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/author/221570/aliza-kelly/">Aliza Kelly</a>, for some intel. “Crystals are sort of like little USB drives,” Kelly says. “They’re particularly receptive to us putting our intentions into them.” Basically, you can consider crystals a super ’gram-friendly combo of a vision board, a diary, and—I don’t know—a guardian angel? They’re not as $$ as they sound either. According to Kelly, “Most of the crystals linked to different practices of love, abundance, prosperity, health, or protection are actually really affordable and not hard to find.”</p>
      <p>I want a crystal starter kit of my own, so I enlisted the help of Erica Feldmann, the founder and owner of <a href="https://hauswitchstore.com/">HausWitch</a>, a home and healing store in Salem, Massachusetts (aka Witch City). And she should know— Feldmann is always packing. “My shop girls and I keep them in our bras, our pockets, our purses, and our cars,” she says. “The bigger chunks are great—but you don’t need that!” Find what you do need below.</p>
