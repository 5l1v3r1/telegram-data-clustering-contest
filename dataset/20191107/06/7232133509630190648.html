      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In the past three sessions, there was a steady decline in bitcoin below the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/06/bitcoin-btc-price-could-accelerate-to-9-8k-unless-it-breaks-9-2k/">$9,400 pivot level</a> against the US Dollar. BTC is facing an increase in selling interest below $9,375, but it is still holding the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>The last swing high was near $9,440 before the price declined towards the $9,200 support area. The recent low was $9,257 and the price is currently consolidating losses.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $9,350-$9,360 area. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $9,440 high to $9,257 low.</p>
      <p>Moreover, there is a key contracting triangle pattern forming with resistance near $9,360 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Therefore, an upside break above the $9,360 and $9,400 resistance levels could set the pace for more gains in the near term.</p>
      <p>Having said that, there is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/05/bitcoin-btc-price-showing-positive-signs-but-lacking-momentum/">cluster of resistances</a> between $9,350 and $9,400. Besides, the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $9,440 high to $9,257 low could act as a resistance.</p>
      <p>Overall, if there is an upside break above $9,360 and $9,400, there could be more gains in the near term. The next key resistance is near the $9,440, above which the price is likely to accelerate towards the $9,500 area.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the triangle trend line at $9,270. If there is a downside break below the triangle and the 100 hourly SMA, the price could test the main $9,200 support area.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/">chart</a>, bitcoin is clearly trading inside a breakout pattern with resistance near $9,350-$9,400. A successful close above $9,400 is needed for more upsides. If not, there is a risk of a bearish reaction below the $9,200 support.</p>
