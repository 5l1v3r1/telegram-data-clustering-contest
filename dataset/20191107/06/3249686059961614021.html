      <p>On November 7, <b>Mnet</b> announced via <b>Mnet Japan</b>'s official website, <i>"The scheduled broadcast of '<b>C</b><b>omeback IZ*ONE: BLOOM*IZ</b>', originally set to air both in Korea and Japan simultaneously on November 11 at 7 PM KST, has been cancelled due to various reasons. We apologize for causing discomfort." </i><br/><br/>Instead of <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/izone">IZ*ONE</a>'s comeback show, Mnet will be broadcasting a special of this year's '<b>2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards</b>' nominations on November 11 at 7 PM KST. Regarding IZ*ONE's 1st full album release, <b>Off The Record Entertainment </b>reps have curtly stated, <i>"Nothing is confirmed." </i></p>
      <p>Earlier on this day, IZ*ONE's side abruptly cancelled the group's comeback showcase. All of the above comes directly after it was reported on November 7 that <b>A</b><b>hn Joon Young</b> PD of Mnet has allegedly admitted to rigging the final votes of '<b>Produce 48</b>' and '<b>Produce X 101</b>'. </p>
