      <h1>Darts: Ross Montgomery back in the game after wife's illness</h1>
      <h2>'The Boss' has made the preliminary round for the 2020 World Championships after a difficult few months</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T06:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Thomson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-thomson/</a></address>
      <p>Ross ‘The Boss’ Montgomery insists it’s a huge achievement to make the preliminary round for the 2020 BDO World Championships after being rocked by his wife’s ill health.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old, from Greenhills, must win a prelim match for the first time in 12 years to ensure his place in the British Darts Organisation’s flagship event in January.</p>
      <p>But The Boss is just thankful that wife Dorothy is on the mend following a worrying time for the Montgomery family.</p>
      <p>He told the News: “The last six months have been difficult for me because my wife has not been well.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully, everything is fine now and I’ve managed to get through to the qualifiers for the World Championships.</p>
      <p>“But that was never my priority, so it’s a feat in itself that I’ve managed to get there.</p>
      <p>“It’s not ideal, but at the end of the day I’ll take it.</p>
      <p>“There were times when I really couldn’t concentrate and it was affecting my games, but my focus is back now and I managed to pull the results together to make the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>“My wife and my sponsors backed me and it’s good to know I’ll be there, albeit I need to get through the qualifying round to reach the main draw.”</p>

      <p>For the first time since 1985, the World Championships will not be played at the iconic Lakeside venue after a deal was agreed to switch the event to London’s Indigo at The O2. </p>
      <p>In his 12 appearances at Lakeside, Montgomery crashed out in the first round eight times.</p>
      <p>He did reach the quarter-finals in 2015, but he’s happy to see the back of the Surrey venue, which has always proved problematic.</p>
      <p>“It will be completely different, but I have heard good things about the venue,” said the Scotland international.</p>
      <p>“For me personally, I’m looking forward to it. Lakeside, at times, has been annoying for me and I haven’t got a great record there, so maybe the change of scenery will do me good.</p>
      <p>“I understand why people will be upset about it moving, because of the history of Lakeside and it is the home of darts, but I am glad it’s not going to be held there anymore.”</p>

      <p>In recent months Montgomery has managed to reach the quarter-finals of the British Classic and Belfry Open in Belgium, as well as playing for Scotland in the World Cup in Romania, where they finished ninth.</p>
      <p>Next up is the Czech Open in Prague on November 15-17 and the Italian Grand Masters from November 23-24.</p>
      <p>“These events will be the last chance to warm-up before the World Championships because there’s no longer the Finders Masters [in Holland] in December anymore, so I’m hoping for some good performances.</p>
      <p>“I’m starting to feel better about my game again. There’s nothing niggling at the back of mind now.</p>
      <p>“Being in the prelims for the Worlds, I’ll have to work that bit harder than I have previously and that could push me on.”</p>
      <p>The BDO World Championships get underway on January 4, 2020.</p>
