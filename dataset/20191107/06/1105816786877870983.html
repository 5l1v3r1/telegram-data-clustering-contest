      <h1>Celine Dion has not passed away in plane crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T06:42:16+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 06:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>CANADA: </b>A website created four days ago claims that Canadian music icon Celine Dion died in a plane crash, without providing details. This is false; Dion’s talent agency told <i>AFP</i> the singer is alive, and the website used an altered video from <i>CNN’s</i> New Day program, although the US news channel never reported Dion’s death.</p>
      <p>“Superstar and singing legend Celine Dion dead at 51,” is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/save/https://worldnews.hytactv.info/#news/748">headline</a> shared hundreds of times on Facebook. Those who click on the link in their social media newsfeed are directed to a webpage where a single video seems to confirm the news.</p>

      <p>However, the video is a cut and altered news segment from CNN’s New Day news show, which lasts just long enough for co-host John Bergman to say the words, “We have some terribly sad news to report this morning, heartbreaking, and devastating.” On the bottom of the screen, a fake news banner again proclaims Dion’s death.</p>
      <p>The video then stops, and in order to play more online users are forced to share the link on Facebook. The report “is absolutely false,” a representative from Dion’s talent agency told <i>AFP</i>.</p>

      <p>A search for the words “Celine Dion dead” yields no results on CNN’s website. The original video used in the hoax was a news segment announcing the death of US chef and TV star Anthony Bourdain on June 8, 2018.</p>
      <p>The identical clip can be seen in a <i>CNN</i> special report.</p>
      <p>Although the false report began to be shared on November 4, Dion, who is on a world tour until September 2020, sang in Detroit, at Michigan’s Little Ceasars Arena on the evening of November 5.</p>
      <p>“Céline” tweeted a photo of herself at the concert, and fans shared moments from the concert on Twitter and Facebook.</p>

      <p>The webpage that features the news of Dion’s death was created on November 2, 2019, according to domain identification tool Whois. This is often a good indication of a news website’s lack of credibility.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old singer announced she would leave her residency of 16 years in Las Vegas in June 2019, and began a world tour to showcase her new album “Courage” in her native Canadian province of Quebec in September.</p>
