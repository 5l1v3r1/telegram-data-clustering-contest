      <h1>Mysterious Hacker Dumps Database of Infamous IronMarch Neo-Nazi Forum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T06:30:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">BeauHD</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/~Freshly+Exhumed">Freshly Exhumed</a> shares a report from ZDNet: <i>A mysterious hacker has published today a database dump of one of the internet's most infamous neo-nazi meeting places -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170509142136/http://ironmarch.org/">the IronMarch forum</a>. The data published today <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mysterious-hacker-dumps-database-of-infamous-ironmarch-neo-nazi-forum/">includes a full copy of its content</a>, including sensitive details such as emails, IP addresses, usernames, and private messages. The database dump is currently being analyzed by a multitude of entities, including law enforcement, in the hopes of linking forum members to accounts on other sites and potentially exposing their real-world identities. The drive to unmask forum members comes from the fact that IronMarch, while a little-known site to most internet users, has been the birthplace of two of today's most extreme far-right neo-nazi movements -- the Atomwaffen Division and SIEGE Culture -- with the first being accused of orchestrating at least eight murders around the world.</i> <a href="https://archive.org/details/iron_march_201911">The forum's data</a> was published earlier today via the Internet Archive portal. <br/><br/>"The published information includes a carbon copy of the site, from user details to forum posts, and from private messages to multi-factor authentication settings and forum management logs," reports BleepingComputer. "The forum's database includes details on 3,548 registered profiles. The last user's database ID is 15,218; however, the dump only included details on 3,548 accounts -- most likely due to spam or deleted profiles. The registration date for the last user is November 20, 2017, suggesting the database is a copy of the site near the time it went offline."</p>
