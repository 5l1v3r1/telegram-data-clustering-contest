      <h1>Avalon Bitcoin Miner Maker Canaan Posts $13 Million Q3 Profit in New Filing</h1>

      <p>Canaan Creative, the world’s second-largest bitcoin miner maker, has made 94 million yuan, or about $13 million, in net profit for Q3 2019, following bitcoin price’s bull run since April this year.</p>
      <p>The company revealed in an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780652/000119312519284407/d773846df1a.htm">updated</a> filing of its initial public offering (IPO) application in the US on Wednesday that it has been able to bring home a profit of $13 million on a revenue of 670 million yuan, or $95 million, which records a 40 percent growth over the same period last year.</p>
      <p>That would give the company a total net loss of $31.2 million on a revenue of $132 million for nine months ending in September this year, as the firm recorded a net loss $45.8 million for the first half of 2019.</p>
      <p>Canaan officially <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/avalon-bitcoin-miner-maker-canaan-officially-files-for-400-million-us-ipo">filed</a> for an IPO in the U.S. last month as its third attempt to go public after its first two applications in mainland China and Hong Kong, respectively, fell through.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin’s price jump since earlier this year has boosted the sales of Canaan’s Avalon miners, which resulted in the market’s demand <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/demand-for-new-bitcoin-miners-is-again-outstripping-supply">outstripping</a> the firm’s supply.</p>
      <p>According to the latest filing, Canaan’s main sales volume for 2019 so far comes from its older Avalon 8 series products with 265,756 units sold, whereas its most latest A9 and A10 models recorded a sales volume of 88,034 and 56,556 units, respectively.</p>
      <p>All in all, Canaan said in the filing that for the first nine months in 2019, it has sold a total computing power of 7.59 exhashes per second, which accounts for roughly eight percent of bitcoin’s current network hash rate.</p>
