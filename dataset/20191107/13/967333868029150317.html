        <b>MOSCOW (Sputnik) - The Russian Foreign Ministry previously underlined that violence against on-duty journalists is unacceptable and had called on the French authorities to carry out a thorough investigation into the incident.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has started a review of the incident involving the use of excessive force against RIA Novosti journalist Viktoria Ivanova by French police at a May Day rally in Paris, according to the OSCE Representative on Media Freedom Harlem Desir.</p>
      <blockquote>"We generally intervene in cases of attacks against journalists during demonstrations, and we try to find precise information each time a case arises. We have been looking at and will continue to study this case," Desir said when asked whether the OSCE planned to promote an investigation into the incident.</blockquote>
      <p>Earlier, the French police failed to name the date when the investigating judge would review the case, and when judiciary scrutiny would be initiated. </p>
      <p>Ivanova, who was covering the May Day demonstrations, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905011074616964-paris-police-may-demonstration/">was attacked</a> by police despite wearing "press" tags on her arm and helmet. The journalist received blows to her head and body, inflicted by a baton-wielding police officer. Ivanova sustained a concussion and bruises on her arms.</p>
