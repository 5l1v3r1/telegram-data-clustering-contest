      <p>On the other hand, the company’s net profit saw a 3.6 per cent decline to Rs 1,052.31 crore during the July to September quarter of the financial year versus Rs 1,091.98 crore during the same period last year.

During the quarter, the company had an inventory gain of Rs 53 crore, compared to Rs 1,276 crore during the second quarter last year. “After adjusting the inventory gain, we had more or less the same GRM during the quarter under review,” he added.</p>
