      <h3>Rectangular pool classic and functional</h3>
      <p>The top priorities for the new Wascana Pool identified in the city-wide online survey are: ”Swimming for leisure and recreation is the highest priority aquatic activity (33%), while swimming for personal fitness is the second priority (18%)”.</p>
      <p>The Request for Proposals states: “One schematic plan shall be a simple basin design similar to the existing pool for comparison to the destination aquatic facility at the Wascana Pool Site”.</p>
      <p>The three designs (actually, one option with three variations) do not offer a replacement 50-metre Wascana Pool. Darryl Condon, the pool consultant from HCMA Architecture + Design, told aquatic stakeholders on August 7 that rectangular pools are boring.</p>
      <p>A rectangular design is classic, ageless, elegant, highly functional, and cost-effective to build and maintain.</p>
      <p>It appears that the City and P3A architects have totally disregarded the input from the community and various stakeholders, and are ignoring the current use pattern of Wascana Pool for 50-yard lane swimming.</p>
      <p>Wascana Pool is our only outdoor pool out of five where professional athletes and recreational swimmers can swim, and where children can play creatively.</p>
      <p>Careful consideration must be given to ensuring that the project is a cost-effective investment, and without losing focus of the basic requirement. Namely: a swimming pool that meets the need for fitness, training and recreation. Namely: a 50-metre x 25-metre pool, and a second warmer pool, replacing the former paddling pool (which was located behind the main pool, closer to Wascana Lake, many years ago).</p>

      <h3>A 50-metre pool suits all swimmers</h3>
      <p>Having swum laps at Wascana Pool for more than 30 years, I noticed a big upswing in usage when the lanes were switched from 25 to 50 yards several years ago.</p>
      <p>It seems to me the ability to swim ‘long course’ was a big drawing card. For most, the longer distance appears to be a much more enjoyable lap-swimming experience relative to a 25 yard or metre pool.</p>
      <p>Pool times were expanded for long-course lap swimming from 8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., which was very well-utilized. After 1:00 the lap section was switched to widths for the remainder of the day. This freed up most of the pool for use by non-lap recreational swimmers of all types, and I believe provided the best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>With respect to a more waterpark-type design, I’m concerned with the feasibility of maintaining large slides, zip lines, climbing walls etc. in an outdoor pool over our long, harsh winters. I think these features are much better suited to an indoor environment where they can be enjoyed year-round, making the most of the investment.</p>
      <p>I firmly believe that a properly designed 50-metre pool can be well-used and enjoyed by both lap, recreational and family swimmers with the simple switching over of some lane markers.</p>
      <p>With the current designs, I’m concerned we’re going to end up with a facility that won’t adequately satisfy either lap or recreational swimmers.</p>
