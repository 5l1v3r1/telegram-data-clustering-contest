      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/mystery-jets">Mystery Jets</a> have announced the rescheduled dates for their UK tour, after health issues forced the band to delay the shows and the release of their latest album.</p>
      <p>The London band announced in September that they <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mystery-jets-postpone-the-release-of-their-new-album-a-billion-heartbeats-and-all-uk-tour-dates-2548981">would be postponing the date</a>s after frontman Blaine Harrison underwent surgery to treat an infection.</p>
      <p>Now, it’s been confirmed that they’ll hit the road once more in April 2020. All original tickets remain valid. Check out the new dates in full below.</p>
      <h3>April 2020</h3>
      <p>10 – Manchester, Academy 2<br/>11 – Kendall, Brewery Arts Centre<br/>13 – Leeds, Wardrobe<br/>14 – Glasgow, Oran Mor<br/>16 – Edinburgh, Caves<br/>17 – Newcastle, Riverside<br/>19 – Hull, Welly Club<br/>20 – Leicester, O2 Academy 2<br/>22 – London, O2 Shepherds Bush Empire<br/>24 – Bristol, Trinity<br/>25 – Birmingham, Mill<br/>27 – Oxford, O2 Academy<br/>28 – Norwich, Waterfront<br/>29 – Brighton, Concorde 2</p>
      <p>The band will also release <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mystery-jets-new-album-billion-heartbeats-tour-alt-right-screwdriver-2535537">new album ‘A Billion Heartbeats</a>’ in January 2020, after pushing the release back from September 2019.</p>
      <p>Harrison, who lives with Spinal Bifida, previously explained how the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mystery-jets-postpone-the-release-of-their-new-album-a-billion-heartbeats-and-all-uk-tour-dates-2548981">infection forced him to undergo emergency surgery.</a></p>
      <p>“It is with a lump in my throat that I bring you the following news from my bed at Chelsea and Westminster hospital, a place that has become something of a home for me over the years,” he said in September.</p>

      <p>“Early on Saturday morning (September 14), I awoke with a swelling in my thigh and a temperature in the high thirties. Upon arrival at A&amp;E I was put straight onto the emergency operation list to halt an infection close to my bone from spreading around my body.”</p>
      <p>He later confirmed that he was “healing up” at home after the successful procedure.</p>
      <p>Harrison also told NME that ‘A Billion Heartbeats’ sees them <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/we-wanted-to-feel-like-it-was-punching-you-in-the-face-mystery-jets-talk-tackling-the-world-on-new-album-a-billion-heartbeats-2546952">tackling the state of the world for the first time</a> and how it proved to be one of their most “direct” albums  so far.</p>
