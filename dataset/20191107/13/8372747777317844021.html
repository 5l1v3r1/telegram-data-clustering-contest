      <p>ATLANTA, Ga. – A rapper is making waves on social media after saying he takes his teenage daughter to the doctor every year to verify that she’s still a virgin.</p>
      <p>While on a podcast of “Ladies Like Us” that was released Tuesday, T.I. was asked about whether he talked to his daughters about sex, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/ti-daughter-hymen-check-doctor">Buzzfeed News reports</a> .</p>
      <p>T.I. replied by admitting the he goes on annual visits to the gynecologist with his daughter, Deyjah Harris, to find out if her hymen is intact.</p>
      <p>The revelation has garnered widespread criticism online. Some social media users blasted the rapper, saying his actions are totally uncalled for and even possibly abusive.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Deyjah, who is now 18 years old and a college student, has not commented publicly, but she has “liked” several of her dad’s critics on Twitter.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6547601/">a study published</a> by The National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health this year, a group of physicians “concluded that an examination of hymen is not an accurate or reliable test of sexual activity.”</p>
