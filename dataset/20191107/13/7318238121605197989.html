      <p>Police in the Czech Republic have launched an investigation into complaints that a mask depicting Adolf Hitler was spotted on sale in a shop in Prague.</p>
      <p>Christoph Israng, the German ambassador to the Czech Republic, tweeted a picture of the mask the day after Halloween as he passed the shop.</p>
      <p>"The Czechs suffered so much under the Nazis," he wrote, adding: "Why is such trash sold in the middle of Prague?"</p>

      <p>Among the dozens of responses, Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said police had since begun an investigation into the shop.</p>
      <p>The Czech police also confirmed to Euronews that it was "dealing with this matter", but said it was "not at liberty to provide more information at this time."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Prague's central district told AFP the shop had since lost its rental agreement in the Malá Strana district.</p>
      <p>"Let's admit that some shops tarnish the reputation of the Prague heritage area," the mayor of the city's central disctrict, Pavel Čižinský, was quoted by AFP as saying.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of people were killed — many of them Jews — under the Nazi occupation between 1938 and 1945 of what was fomerly known as Czechoslovakia.</p>
