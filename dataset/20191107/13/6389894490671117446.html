      <h1>Brexit inspires Collins' first-ever 'Brexicon'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T13:21:53+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Thicknesse</a></address>
      <p>The Collins Dictionary put a spin on its annual word of the year announcement today by releasing its ‘Brexicon’, a list of ten words brought to prominence by Brexit – “for better or for worse.”</p>
      <p>‘Cakeism’ – a wish to enjoy two desirable and incompatible alternatives – rubs shoulders with ‘Brexiety’ – a state of heightened anxiety triggered by concerns about the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, whilst other more straightforward terms include ‘no-deal’, ‘remoaner’, and ‘stockpiling’.</p>

      <p>However, it’s not good news for Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson, as ‘to milkshake’ has now been recognised as a verb, defined as the act of throwing the eponymous drink over a public figure in order to humiliate them.</p>
      <p>Both men were victim to the frozen delicacy during campaigning earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Collins was keen to stress that the dictionary remained politically impartial on Brexit. Helen Newstead, Language Content Consultant at the education group, said:</p>
      <p>“The Dictionary has no opinion on Brexit, other than to say it has been quite generous in its gifts to the English language, as well as I am sure inspiring the use of many old-fashioned expletives.</p>
      <p>“The Brexicon could be even longer, but as the process continues through this latest ‘flextension’, no doubt more words will emerge until we come to a ‘Brexend’.”</p>
      <p>The company also announced its 2019 word of the year, an honour which has in the past been bestowed on “single-use”, “fake news”, and, naturally, Brexit.</p>
      <p>This year ‘climate strike’ beat off competition from ‘cancelled’, ‘deepfake’ and ‘non-binary’.</p>
      <p>Although the first use of climate strike came back in 2015, the word has seen a 100 times increase in usage this year, the largest of any word on the shortlist.</p>

      <p>Inspired by Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg, climate strikes have spread throughout the world this year, becoming a frequent reality in many of the world’s largest cities.</p>
      <p>Newstead said: “Climate strikes can often divide opinion, but they have been inescapable this last year and have even driven a former word of the year, ‘Brexit’ from the top of the news agenda, if only for a short time.”</p>
