      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a> man in the midst of a divorce apparently slashed the throats of his wife and young daughter before hanging himself -- a gruesome double <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health">murder-suicide</a> that cops reportedly discovered Wednesday night while performing a wellness check.</p>
      <p>Each member of the family <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/homicide">was found dead</a> inside a different room of their apartment in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-york">Manhattan</a> neighborhood of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">Harlem</a>, officials told<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/07/3-people-including-5-year-old-girl-dead-in-grisly-scene-in-harlem-apartment-police/"> The New York Post.</a> Police made the grisly finds -- the girl in her bedroom, the mother in the bathroom and the father in the couple's bedroom -- at about 9:20 p.m. Wednesday. It was not immediately clear how long the three had been dead.</p>

      <p>Investigators said the 46-year-old father and 42-year-old mother had been scheduled to appear in court as part of the divorce proceeding earlier Wednesday. Officials said there was no known history of domestic abuse. Cops recovered a knife at the scene, but it was not confirmed to be the murder weapon used to kill the woman and 5-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>Authorities descended on the Harlem address after the woman's brother called 911 and requested a wellness check, the Post reported.</p>
      <p>None of the deceased were immediately identified.</p>
