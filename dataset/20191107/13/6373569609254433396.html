      <p>A Plymouth man has appeared in court charged with throwing bleach at a woman and her two-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old faced city magistrates accused of attacking the mum and toddler intending to seriously injure them.</p>
      <p>He answered two charges of throwing a corrosive fluid with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or disable the pair on March 24.</p>
      <p>The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is also accused of assaulting the mother causing actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>He also faces a charge of affray and causing criminal damage to the childâ€™s property on that same day.</p>
      <p>The man did not enter any pleas.</p>
      <p>Magistrates heard that the case was so serious that it could only be heard by a judge.</p>
      <p>The defendant was released on unconditional bail to appear at Plymouth Crown Court on December 9.</p>
