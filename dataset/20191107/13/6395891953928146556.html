      <p>Lava tubes are channels formed by nature where lava flows beneath the surface.</p>
      <p>While the tubes snake under the Hawaiian islands, it is rare that someone falls into them, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/07/hawaii-lava-tubes-deadly-fall-backyard-big-island/">The Washington Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Police believe the man, who was in his 70s, was trimming branches when he sank through the soft ground over the tubes. Officials said there could have been a hole that the man couldn't see due to overgrowth, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/11/07/hawaii-lava-tubes-deadly-fall-backyard-big-island/">the Post reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Rescue teams recovered his body by rappelling into the lava tube, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/us/man-dies-falling-in-lava-tube-trnd/index.html">CNN reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The man died from injuries consistent with falling, police said. </p>
