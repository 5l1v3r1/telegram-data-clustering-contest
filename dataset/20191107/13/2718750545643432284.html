      <p>Parents: What they don’t know won’t hurt them. At least, that was <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/in-honey-boy-shia-labeouf-channels-his-own-abusive-father.html"><i>Honey Boy</i></a><i> </i>star <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/11/how-shia-reacted-to-every-one-of-his-movies.html">Shia LaBeouf’s</a> approach to asking his own dad, Jeffrey LaBeouf, if he could not only make a movie about him, but also <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/shia-labeouf-is-unrecognizable-as-his-father-in-new-biopic.html">play him himself</a>. (Noah Jupe and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/lucas-hedges-to-star-in-shia-labeoufs-shia-labeouf-film.html">Lucas Hedges</a> play 12- and 22-year-old Shia LaBeouf, respectively.) The writer and star of <i>Honey Boy</i> explained just how he got his dad to sign off on the film while appearing on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live! </i>“My dad’s a pretty off-color character,” LaBeouf began. “He wasn’t too enthused about me playing him.” <i>Honey Boy</i>, which was originally written as a PTSD exercise while the actor was in <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/report-shia-labeouf-checked-into-rehab.html">court-mandated rehab</a>, details the verbal and physical abuse he received from his father. The film’s director, Alma Har’el, told Business Insider that LaBeouf hadn’t spoken to his father “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-shia-labeoufs-rehab-led-to-honey-boy-being-made-2019-11">in seven years</a>.” But he needed to make this movie. “So I lied to him and told him that Mel Gibson would be playing him,” LaBeouf laughed on <i>Kimmel</i>. “My dad was like ‘Mel Gibson? Alright, okay, alright.’ Had him sign the paperwork. And then I got home and I broke it to him. I sent him pictures. I said ‘Listen, man, it’s not like that.’”</p>
