      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/north-carolina">North Carolina</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education/high-school">high school</a> teacher recently charged with having <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/sex-crimes">sex with a student</a> was found dead in her home on Wednesday along with her husband, according to officials.</p>
      <p>The Huntersville <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Police Department</a> said the bodies of Emma Ogle, 63, and her husband, 59-year-old Michael Ogle, were discovered by members of a SWAT team shortly after they made entry into the couple's home in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast">Huntersville</a>, located north of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">Charlotte</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's a very unfortunate situation," Huntersville Police Officer Odette Saglimbeni said at a news conference. "It's not a very common thing that we see here in Huntersville, so when it happens it's shocking."</p>

      <p>Authorities responded to the home after receiving a call around 8 a.m. about a "barricaded <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">suspect</a>" inside, according to officials.</p>
      <p>Before the call was made, Huntersville police said Ogle had not shown up at work in the morning and was not answering calls, which prompted a family relative to go to the home to check on him. When the family member arrived at the home, they noticed Emma Ogle with a handgun and her husband dead inside.</p>
      <p>"The information we have is that she was still alive when the family member got there and her husband was not," Saglimbeni told reporters.</p>

      <p>After contacting police, multiple agencies responded to the scene, including a SWAT team. The incident caused several roads to be closed in the area at the time, at an elementary school was placed on lockdown.</p>
      <p>Police said they tried to make multiple attempts to contact the 63-year-old until going in at 9:51 a.m. and discovering the bodies of the couple inside. The two were found dead from apparent gunshot wounds, according to Saglimbeni.</p>
      <p>While the deaths appeared to be an apparent murder-suicide, the Huntersville Police Department <a href="https://twitter.com/HPDNC/status/1192203769351753728">said the deaths</a> are still under investigation.</p>
      <p>"At this point, it's really trying to piece together what happened," Saglimbeni said.</p>
