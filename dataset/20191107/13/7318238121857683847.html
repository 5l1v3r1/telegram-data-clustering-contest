      <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was met by angry protests during a visit to Budapest for talks with Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán.</p>
      <p>While Orbán is a staunch supporter of Ankara, Erdogan's recent incursion into northern Syria ensured that his reception was far from positive on the streets of the Hungarian capital.</p>

      <p>Appearing on Euronews's Good Morning Europe, the co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee human rights group, Marta Pardavi, explained the unusual bond between the two leaders.</p>
      <p>The close relationship goes back to 2013 when Orbán was looking for trade partners in the East. He and Erdogan found an immediate understanding.</p>
      <p>The alliance has strengthened since the migration crisis and the deal Erdogan struck with the European Union to hold back refugees coming from Syria.</p>
      <p>Orbán hailed the change of the (Turkish) constitution, attended Erdogan's inauguration as a president and slowed down the EU's condemnation of the Turkish offensive in Syria.</p>
      <p>What Hungary gets in return is not quite evident. While trade between the 2 countries is growing, it is still far from the goal set in 2013.</p>
      <p>Not all Hungarians are happy with Orbán's friendship with Erdogan: further demonstrations are planned in response to what the organisers call the invitation of a war criminal to Hungary.</p>
      <p>During Erdogan's last visit, only the demonstration supporting the Turkish president were permitted by the Hungarian authorities</p>
