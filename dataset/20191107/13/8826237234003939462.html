      <p>(LUMBERTON, N.C.) — A 13-year-old suspect in a double homicide who escaped custody has been returned to authorities.</p>
      <p>News outlets report the teen’s mother, Nikki Jacobs, turned him over to U.S. Marshals in Lumberton on Wednesday night. The teen <a href="https://apnews.com/c215b58a89244187b0d2150a262d50ca">escaped</a> from Juvenile Court around noon Tuesday.</p>
      <p>WRAL-TV reports Jacobs says her son spent Tuesday and Wednesday at his grandmother’s old house, which is abandoned. He then found a bike and rode it to his uncle’s home.</p>
      <p>The teen’s uncle, Wayne Lambert, says he allowed the boy to shower and eat before calling authorities.</p>
      <p>The teen and a 19-year-old Derrick Deshawn Hunt are charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the killings of two brothers found dead inside a home last month.</p>
