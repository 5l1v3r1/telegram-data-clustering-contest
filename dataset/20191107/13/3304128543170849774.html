      <p>Co-operative Bank and CFAO Kenya Ltd (Toyota Tsusho East Africa Ltd) have launched a new Financing Scheme that will enable farmers and co-operative societies to finance the purchase of tractors, combined harvesters and other farm equipment through loans.</p>
      <p>The scheme will offer farmers and co-operative societies up to 80 percent financing in purchase of agricultural machinery and equipment. The scheme will also give farmers the option of seasonal loan payments, to match with the seasonal nature of some agricultural crop cycles.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the two firms said that farmers will enjoy an extended loan repayment period of up to 60 months, perhaps the longest available in the market today.</p>

      <p>For customers who pay 50 percent deposit and repay the loan in 12 months, the loan will not attract any interest charges.</p>
      <p>As an added benefit, customers will receive 250 kilogrammes of Baraka Fertilizer with the purchase of every tractor under this scheme.</p>
      <p>“With this partnership, we will enable farmers and co-operative societies to more easily acquire brand new Agri-machinery and equipment from a trusted and leading brand,” said Co-op Bank Director of Co-operatives Banking, Mr Vincent Marangu.</p>

      <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) the sector employs more than 40 per cent of the total population and more than 70 per cent of Kenya’s rural people.</p>
