      <p>MONTREAL -- Jessica Soto Fernandez, a Chilean woman who has been living in Montreal for 30 years, was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma in June.</p>
      <p>Soto is in urgent need of a stem-cell transplant, specifically from a compatible Latin American donor, but has so far been unable to find one.</p>
      <p>Friends and family who were tested are not compatible, and no compatible stem cells can be found in donation banks in Quebec and across the country.</p>
      <p>Desperate for a donor, Soto - a 50-year-old mother of three who works in social services, dealing mainly with homeless people suffering from mental illness - is now putting out a call to the public.</p>
      <p>Soto's family is asking people of Latin American descent who are between the ages of 18 to 35 to take a Hema-Quebec test to see if they are a match.</p>
      <p>The cotton-swab testing kit is available for free <a href="https://www.hema-quebec.qc.ca/cellules-souches/donneur/etapes-a-suivre-pour-m-inscrire.en.html">via Hema-Quebec</a>.</p>
      <p>Soto's case recalls that of Mai Duong, a Montrealer of Vietnamese descent who went public in 2014 with her call for a blood cord donor, a global search that made international headlines.</p>
