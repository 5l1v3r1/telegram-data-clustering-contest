      <p>The 39 Vietnamese migrants who died in a refrigerated lorry trailer as they were smuggled into Britain have been identified.</p>
      <p>Detectives had been working with Vietnamese officials to identify the 31 men and eight women, whose families are now waiting to collect their bodies and planning funerals in their homeland.</p>
      <p>DNA samples for identification were provided by 21 families from Nghe An province and 10 from Ha Tinh province in the Southeast Asian country.</p>
      <p>The names of the victims have not been officially released.</p>
      <p>The victims were found dead inside the container at an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, in the early hours of October 23 after it arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <p>The ferry landed at a port in Purfleet and paramedics and police were called to the industrial estate, where the trailer was found attached to a lorry, just over an hour later.</p>

      <p>Having identified all of the victims, HM Senior Coroner, Mrs Caroline Beasley-Murray said: “May I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims’ families.”</p>
      <p>The senior officer in charge of the enquiry, Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith added: “This is an important step in the investigation and enables us to work with our Vietnamese Police colleagues to support the families of those victims.</p>
      <p>"It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information.</p>
      <p>"Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those whose tragic journey ended on our shores.”</p>

      <p>Police have started extradition proceedings to bring 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison from Ireland, where he is in custody, to the UK.</p>
      <p>Harrison, of Newry in Co Down, Northern Ireland, faces charges of 39 counts of manslaughter, along with human trafficking and immigration offences. </p>

      <p>The pair, from Armagh in Northern Ireland, are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>Three other people arrested in connection with the incident - two men aged 38 and 46 and a 38-year-old woman - have been released on bail.</p>
      <p>Essex Police and the Government have been working closely with a delegation from Vietnam during the painstaking process of identifying the victims and determining the cause of death of each one.</p>
      <p>Vietnam has arrested two people in Ha Tinh province and nine in Nghe An. They face charges of organising people smuggling overseas.</p>
      <p>An official from the Nghe An police force told Vietnamese media on Thursday that the bodies would be flown from the UK to Noi Bai airport in the capital Hanoi.</p>
      <p>The bodies will then be handed over to families for burial.</p>
      <p>Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the incident a "serious humanitarian tragedy".</p>
