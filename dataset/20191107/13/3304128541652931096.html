      <p>Facebook-owned messaging platform, WhatsApp, has finally rolled out a new privacy update that will prevent administrators from adding its users to groups without consent.</p>
      <p>In a blog post published this week, WhatsApp noted that the move followed increased demands by users to have control of their experience.</p>
      <p>For a long time, people decried being added to groups by strangers. Some complained of being added to groups they didn’t want to participate in.</p>
      <p>The new Group feature is available on the latest update of Android and iOS devices.</p>

      <p>To enable it, go to Settings in your app, then tap Account &gt; Privacy &gt; Groups and select one of three options: “Everyone,” “My Contacts,” or “My Contacts Except.”</p>
      <p>“My Contacts” means only users you have in your address book can add you to groups and “My Contacts Except” provides additional control for who among your contacts can add you to a group.</p>
      <p>“In those cases, an admin who can’t add you to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving you the choice of joining the group, ” said WhatsApp.</p>
      <p>You will have three days to accept the invite before the link expires.</p>

      <p>In its beta release, the feature had a “Nobody” option but WhatsApp replaced it with “My Contacts Except” after receiving feedback from users.</p>
      <p>This allows you to choose to exclude specific contacts or “select all” to exclude all contacts.</p>
      <p>The new update is rolling out to users around the world who have installed the latest version of the WhatsApp application.</p>
