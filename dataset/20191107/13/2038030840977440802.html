      <p>Cape Town – If you've ever wanted to own the late King of Pop's socks, now is your chance!</p>
      <p>Michael - who died in 2009 at the age of 50 – wore the custom crystal socks the first time he showed off his moonwalk during a performance of <i>Billie Jean</i> in the 1983 TV special <i>Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.</i></p>
      <p>Now you can own the bedazzled pieces of history as they are going under the hammer in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>An auction site named <a href="https://gottahaverockandroll.com/"><b>Gotta have rock and roll</b></a> are offering the socks as part of the late music executive Frank DiLeo's collection, and they come with a signed letter from Michael to the deceased music executive. </p>
