      <p>TOKYO, Nov 7 — Hideo Kojima, creator of the hugely anticipated <i>Death Stranding</i> game released this week, turned a family obsession with film into a talent for making highly cinematic video games.</p>
      <p>Best known for his acclaimed <i>Metal Gear</i> series, Kojima spent nearly 30 years at Konami, a major firm that he has said he joined because they were the only games company listed on the stock market at the time.</p>
      <p>He was born in 1963, to a family obsessed with movies. When he was young, his parents began a tradition of watching a film every night.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t allowed to go to bed till the film had finished: The opposite of how it is for most children,” he told <i>The Guardian</i> in an interview.</p>
      <p>The tradition had a huge influence, and as he got older he was encouraged by his parents to see movies by himself at the cinema.</p>
      <p>They would give him money for the ticket, but on the condition he came back and discussed the film’s themes and its impact on him.</p>
      <p>He lost his father when he was just 13, and at university he initially studied economics, before switching gears in his final year and deciding to enter gaming.</p>
      <p>His mother supported the move, but his friends were strongly opposed, and the social pressure had an effect: He chose to work at Konami because it was listed on the stock exchange, giving it a prestige he thought might justify his decision.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Continue as long as I live’</b>
      </p>
      <p>A year after he joined in 1986, the first iteration of <i>Metal Gear</i> was released, which saw gamers controlling special forces operative “Solid Snake”, and encouraged to avoid and outsmart enemies over engaging in direct combat.</p>
      <p>Several sequels followed, developing the stealth ability of characters and featuring the cinematic cut-scenes that would become a signature of Kojima’s work.</p>
      <p>He achieved cult status however with the 1998 release of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, a game that one review declared “comes closer to perfection than any other game in PlayStation’s action genre”.</p>
      <p>Further sequels followed, and as his star rose he created his own production unit inside Konami. In 2005 he won an MTV lifetime achievement award for the <i>Metal Gear</i> series.</p>
      <p>“I have to say, even though I have received this award, let me state that I will not retire,” he told a cheering audience.</p>
      <p>“I will continue to create games as long as I live.”</p>
      <p>In 2015, he shocked the gaming world by announcing he was parting ways with Konami and would run his studio as an independent firm.</p>
      <p>Speculation raged over the reasons for the split, with some citing Kojima’s near-obsessive desire to control all aspects of production on his games, or Konami’s alleged strict controls on employees. Others pointed to the industry-wide shift from console games toward mobile devices.</p>
      <p>
        <b>‘Prone to loneliness’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kojima has said the decision was not an easy one, with his family deeply opposed and banks reluctant to lend to him despite his international fame.</p>
      <p>But just a year later, he grabbed headlines when he stunned a crowd at gaming expo E3 by unveiling the first trailer for <i>Death Stranding</i>, with audience members chanting his name as he laughed gently.</p>
      <p>“Hello everyone, I’m back!” he said.</p>
      <p>The game has been the subject of furious speculation for years during development.</p>
      <p>In the run-up to its release, Kojima began to reveal more about its premise — a broken world in need of reconnection.</p>
      <p>He told the <i>BBC</i> it was inspired by the political — including President Donald Trump’s plan to build a border wall, and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union — but also by the personal.</p>
      <p>“I’m very prone to loneliness. I think there are similar people around the world, especially gamers... They don’t feel like they fit into society or their community,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So when those people play this game, they realise people like them exist all over the world.”</p>
      <p>“Knowing that even though I’m lonely, there are other people like me, makes you feel at ease.” — AFP</p>
