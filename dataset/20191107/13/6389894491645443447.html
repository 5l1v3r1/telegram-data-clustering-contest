      <h1>KKR to target record $15bn in Asia-focused buyout fund</h1>

      <p>Private equity giant KKR is said to be targeting a record $15bn (£11.7bn) raise for its planned Asia-focused buyout fund.</p>
      <p>The fundraising is set to begin early next year, with the aim of reaching its first close — the minimum threshold to make investments — by June, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The target, if reached, will surpass KKR’s previous record of a $9.3bn fund, set in 2017.</p>
      <p>KKR has been one of the biggest US private equity investors in China and other Asian countries, bolstered by about $19bn raised by the firm in its three funds focused on the region. The firm’s investments in China include ByteDance, the owner of short-form video app TikTok.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week KKR raised its biggest-ever European fund at €5.8bn (£5bn), with 28 per cent of the fund already committed to a number of deals.</p>

      <p>The New York-based buyout firm recently obtained a majority stake in full-fibre broadband firm Hyperoptic, as part of a deal valued at £500m. It also owns stakes in Trainline, German publishing giant Axel Springer and UK cybersecurity startup Darktrace.</p>
      <p>Last week KKR reported a 23 per cent year-on-year drop in its quarterly post-tax distributable profit, as fee revenue slid amid a broader slowdown in asset sales by buyout firms.</p>
      <p>It said at the time it plans to begin fundraising across its three largest flagship funds — Asian private equity, American private equity and global infrastructure — in addition to 20 other funds, as part of a plan to increase management fee revenue by 50 per cent over three years.</p>
      <p>Shares in KKR on Wall Street have risen more than 40 per cent so far this year.</p>
      <p>KKR did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
