      <p>Starting today, November 7, Microsoft's second-generation HoloLens augmented reality device is starting to ship to customers who pre-ordered it. Microsoft has been taking HoloLens 2 preorder information starting earlier this year from customers in the U.S., France, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, and the U.K. <br/><br/><b>Also: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-hololens-2-everything-developers-and-it-pros-need-to-know/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b">Microsoft HoloLens 2: Everything developers and IT pros need to know</a> TechRepublic</b><br/><br/>Once the company fulfills its initial set of pre-orders, it will begin shipping to additional customers, officials said, starting with those in the aforementioned countries.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-hololens-2-why-its-really-all-about-the-cloud/">Microsoft took the wraps off the HoloLens 2</a> in late February this year at Mobile World Congress.<br/><br/>HoloLens 2 -- which, technically, is the third iteration of the HoloLens, as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-next-hololens-device-may-not-debut-until-2019-report/">Microsoft skipped over version two</a> -- looks somewhat different from the first HoloLens, which Microsoft began selling in 2016. It has a visor that can easily flip up; features a larger vertical field of view; connects to Azure to provide various capabilities and services; and is built to be lighter and better weighted. It has a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-hololens-to-feature-snapdragon-850-report/">Snapdragon 850 compute engine</a> and an on-board custom AI holographic co-processor.  AI models have been deployed on the holographic processor in order to track users' hand motions and eye gazes in order to interact with holograms.</p>
      <p>Microsoft is offering <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy">three pricing options for HoloLens 2</a>: A $3,500 HoloLens 2 developer edition (available with financing for $99 per user per month); a HoloLens 2 device-only SKU for $3,500; and a HoloLens 2 subscription version (with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist preloaded) starting at $125 per user per month. <br/><br/>A Microsoft official misspoke earlier this year and said <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-hololens-2-looks-ready-to-go-on-sale-in-september/">HoloLens 2 would be going on sale in September 2019</a>. That wasn't the company's actual plan, however.</p>
      <p>Microsoft, these days, is positioning HoloLens as a way to provide mixed-reality technology for business uses.</p>
