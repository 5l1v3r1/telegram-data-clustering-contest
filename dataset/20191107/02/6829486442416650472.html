      <h1>People Are Disgusted By T.I.’s Comments About Monitoring His Daughter’s Hymen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T02:37:32+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 02:37</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Rennex</a></address>
      <p>In a podcast, T.I. has said that he has attended yearly gynaecologist visits with his daughter, Deyjah Harris, every year since she turned 16 to “check her hymen”.</p>
      <p>Rapper T.I., who is no stranger to controversy, has recently come under fire for his recent comments about his daughter and her hymen.</p>
      <p>During the now-edited ‘Life Hacks with T.I.’ episode of the <i>Ladies Like Us</i> podcast, hosted by Nazanin Mandi and Nandia Moham, T.I. shared insights into his marriage and parenting style.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/clarissajanlim/ti-daughter-hymen-check-doctor">BuzzFeed News</a>, when the hosts asked T.I if he has had the “sex talk” with his daughters, he spoke about his experience with his daughter, Deyjah Harris.</p>

      <p>T.I. explained that he has indeed had the conversation with her and actually accompanies Deyjah, who is now 18 and a college student, on “yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen”.</p>
      <p>While the hosts giggled through the clearly awkward topic, T.I. recounted: “There was this one time, I think this might’ve been after her 16th birthday… I put a sticky note on the door: ‘Gyno. Tomorrow. 9:30.'”</p>
      <p>He continued, “So we’ll go and sit down and the doctor comes and talk, and the doctor’s maintaining a high level of professionalism. He’s like, ‘You know, sir, in order or me to share information’ — I said, ‘Deyjah, they want you to sign this so we can share information. Is there anything you would not want me to know? Oh, ok. See, Doc? Ain’t no problem,'” T.I. said.</p>
      <p>Despite the doctor explaining to him that hymen inspection as an indicator as virginity <a href="https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/virginity-testing-elimination/en/">isn’t a valid method</a>, T.I. still insisted. “She don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bike, she don’t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.'”</p>
      <p>He ended the discussion with “I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.”</p>
      <p>After the internet caught wind of T.I’s comments, there was major backlash against the rapper.</p>

      <p>While others found issues with the fact that “she’s 18” was trending because of the implications that T.I.s actions would be acceptable at any age.</p>

      <p>The conversation also brought forth discussion around T.I. and the double standard he holds for his sons over his daughters.</p>
      <p>In a clip from the Harris family reality TV show, <i>T.I. &amp; Tiny: The Family Hustle</i>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hoehealing/status/1192210451859419140?s=20">it’s revealed</a> that King Harris, Deyjahs younger brother, had lost his virginity.</p>
      <p>In reaction to finding out, T.I. shared that while he doesn’t want any of his children having sex before it’s time for them, he “will definitely feel different about a boy than I will about a girl and that is just the God’s honest truth.”</p>

        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/hoehealing/status/1192210451859419140?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Beyond the obvious issues with T.I.s actions, including privacy invasion and his possessive behaviours, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437416/">studies show</a> that virginity tests actually do not “accurately or reliably predict virginity status”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/DrJenGunter">Dr Jennifer Gunter</a>, a popular OB/GYN, even weighed in on the matter, likening the hymen to baby teeth which do not serve a purpose beyond the developmental stages.</p>
      <p>“The hymen is no virginity indicator. 50% of sexually active teens do not have a disrupted hymen,” <a href="https://twitter.com/DrJenGunter/status/1192143632394002433?s=20">she tweeted</a>. “The hymen means nothing physically and hymen exams are medically not a thing. They are unnecessary and support a disgusting patriarchal trope.”</p>

      <p>While neither Deyjah or her representatives have commented on the matter, her likes on Twitter do imply that she, like everyone else, is also uncomfortable with situation.</p>
