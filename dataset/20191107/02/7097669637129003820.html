      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) â€” The Latest on Las Vegas city officials considering a law to make sleeping on the streets illegal (all times local):</p>
      <p>6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Despite protests about a war on the poor, Las Vegas officials passed a law Wednesday making it illegal to sleep on the streets when beds are available at established shelters.</p>
      <p>The measure framed as a ban on camping downtown makes Las Vegas the latest city in the U.S. West to take steps to try to deal with complaints about homelessness.</p>
      <p>It has also drawn criticism from several Democratic presidential candidates.</p>
      <p>Effective Jan. 1, the law makes it a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine for sleeping or camping in public areas.</p>
      <p>Opponents and protesters called it unfair.</p>
      <p>Mayor Carolyn Goodman, sponsor of the measure, called it imperfect but necessary amid what officials called a homeless crisis in a city with an international tourist attraction at stake.</p>

      <p>Amid protests that they would criminalize being homeless, Las Vegas elected officials are poised to make it a misdemeanor for people to sleep or camp in public areas when beds are available at established shelters.</p>
      <p>About 100 people rallied Wednesday at City Hall against the new law ahead of what is expected to be a contentious public hearing and City Council vote.</p>
      <p>The debate makes Las Vegas the latest city in the West to address complaints about people living on the streets.</p>
      <p>Officials say the new city law will protect the homeless, safeguard business interests and address a public health crisis.</p>
      <p>Protesters call it unfair.</p>
      <p>Rev. Leonard Jackson of the Faith Organizing Alliance says providing jobs, housing and health care would better help people now living on the streets.</p>
