      <p>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — The International Criminal Court sentenced a Congolese warlord known as “The Terminator” to 30 years imprisonment Thursday after he was convicted of crimes including murder, rape and sexual slavery.</p>
      <p>The sentence was the highest ever passed by the global court.</p>
      <p>Bosco Ntaganda was found guilty in July of 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in atrocities in a bloody ethnic conflict in a mineral-rich region of Congo in 2002-2003.</p>
      <p>Ntaganda showed no emotion as Presiding Judge Robert Fremr passed sentences ranging from eight years to 30 years for individual crimes and an overarching sentence of 30 years.</p>
      <p>The court’s maximum sentence is 30 years, although judges also have the discretion to impose a life sentence.</p>
