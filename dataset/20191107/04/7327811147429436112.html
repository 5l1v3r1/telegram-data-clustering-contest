      <p>THE BRONX (WABC) -- The woman suspected of climbing into the lion's exhibit at the Bronx Zoo and taunting the animal as it looked on surrendered to police in Brooklyn, the NYPD said.</p>

      <p>The zoo said it has a "zero-tolerance policy" for this type of behavior.</p>
      <p>"This action was a serious violation and unlawful trespass that could have resulted in serious injury or death. Barriers and rules are in place to keep both visitors, staff, and animals safe," the zoo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The park told police that there is a moat with an approximately 14-foot drop between where the woman was standing in the video and the lion.</p>
