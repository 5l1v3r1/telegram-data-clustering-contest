      <h1>Liverpool could make Timo Werner transfer swoop in January says former Reds ace</h1>
      <h2>Emile Heskey reckons Jurgen Klopp must spend in new year to bring in top-class competition for forwards and keep Reds ahead of Man City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T04:00:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool could strengthen their fearsome forward line by swooping for Timo Werner in January, according to Emile Heskey.</p>
      <p>Reds boss Jurgen Klopp opted not to sign senior players in the summer following the Reds' Champions League triumph.</p>
      <p>But Heskey reckons Klopp must spend in the new year as he bids to keep his side ahead of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the race for the Premier League title.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/timo-werner">Werner</a> has been linked with both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , and the 23-year-old centre-forward has scored eight goals in all competitions for RB Leipzig this season.</p>
      <p>Liverpool of course have Sadio Mane, Mo Salah and Roberto Firmino as their first-choice forwards, as well as Divock Origi and Rhian Brewster as back-up.</p>

      <p>But former Reds striker Heskey thinks they need another top-class attacker to ease the pressure on Mane, Salah and Firmino and freshen up the competition.</p>
      <p>“I think he'll reinforce,” said Heskey, who was speaking of behalf of GentingBet in quotes reported by the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool-transfer-swoop-timo-werner-20790994">Daily Star</a> . “He'll just add one or two in key areas.</p>
      <p>“I don't think they have enough strength and depth in attack.</p>
      <p>“They do at the back - particularly at centre-back - but going forward they are more limited.</p>

      <p>“Divock Origi is handy when he comes on, but they've got a young lad like Rhian Brewster who isn't established yet - even though he's a great talent.</p>
      <p>“Nobody knows what he could possibly become. But at this moment in time we don't know if he's the next big thing."</p>
      <p>Heskey isn't worried that the potential arrival of 28-cap Germany international Werner could upset the dressing room balance at Liverpool - insisting instead that it could spur the club's current strike force on to even greater levels of performance.</p>
      <p>“It can rattle egos,” said Heskey.</p>

      <p>“But this is where your staff will have done their homework.</p>
      <p>“In a sense of who you bring into the club, obviously it's going to upset someone - especially when they could take your place.</p>
      <p>“But as a player, you've got to be able to say: ‘Okay I'm going to rise to the occasion’.”</p>

      <p>“Origi still has a future there, but as a starter - someone you'll put your faith in - probably not.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool and United have been <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/timo-werner-transfer-warning-sent-20811923">warned by RB Leipzig</a> that they do not intend to let Werner leave the club.</p>
      <p>The striker is contracted to Leipzig until the summer of 2023 and would cost at least £58million, according to stats site <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/timo-werner/profil/spieler/170527">Transfermarkt</a> .</p>
