      <h3>Ripple Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Yesterday, we saw bullish moves in ripple above the $0.2980 support area against the US Dollar. Recently, XRP rallied sharply above the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/06/ripple-xrp-price-following-uptrend-above-0-2950-eyes-0-3100/">$0.3040 and $0.3120 resistance levels</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the price faced a strong selling interest near the $0.3150 area. A new weekly high was formed near $0.3149 and the price is currently declining sharply. It tumbled below the $0.3040 and $0.3000 levels.</p>
      <p>A swing low was formed near $0.2952 and the price is now back above $0.3000. Moreover, the price seems to be holding the key $0.2980 support area and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance for ripple is near the $0.3050 area. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.3149 high to $0.2952 low. If there are any further gains, the price could test the $0.3100 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Besides, the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.3149 high to $0.2952 low is also near the $0.3100 area to act as a resistance. A convincing break above $0.3100 could start a decent rise in the coming sessions.</p>
      <p>On the downside, there are many important supports near the $0.3000 and $0.2980 levels. More importantly, yesterday’s major bullish trend line is active with support near $0.2990 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
      <p>The main support is near the $0.2980 level and the 100 hourly SMA. If there is a close below the $0.2980 support, the price is likely to accelerate declines. The next key supports are near the $0.2900 and $0.2880 levels.</p>

As long as there is no close below $0.2980, it could bounce back above $0.3040 and $0.3050. Conversely, there is a risk of a fresh decline towards the $0.2880 support area.</p>
