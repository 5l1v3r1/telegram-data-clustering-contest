      <p>ANAHEIM, Calif. (KABC) -- The happiest place on Earth is adding more plant-based options to its menu.<br/><br/>Disneyland Resorts is preparing to officially announce its plant-based menu items in the spring of 2020.<br/><br/>The resort's Culinary Director, John State, said his team has been listening to their guests.<br/><br/>"We're inspired by their feedback, going back into the kitchen, working on creating, innovating and introducing new flavors that just happen to be plant-based. Plant-based is what our guests are looking for," State said.<br/><br/>State said his crew was looking to tell a story through food.<br/><br/>The items available before the official launch included al pastor marinated cauliflower tacos at Rancho del Zocalo Restaurante, cape gooseberries in the Rongo Salad at the Disneyland Hotel and bulgogi-style plant-based sausage in the Ronto-less Garden Wrap at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge.<br/><br/>"It really ties into where the land is and what the characters are," State said.<br/><br/>State said his favorite were the potato flautas at Lamplight Lounge inside Disney California Adventure Park.<br/><br/>"This is actually a hidden gem. It's probably becoming the most popular dish on the menu," State said, right before breaking it down: "Crispy corn tortillas, filled with soft potatoes, topped with a plant-based chorizo, slightly spicy, serrano chili tomatillo salsa and then topped with a fragrant fresno-chile, escobiche-style salad with arugula."<br/><br/>Several resort guests were glad to hear there was more to choose from.<br/><br/>John South said he is 90% vegetarian and found it hard to stick to his diet while traveling.<br/><br/>"I'm ready to try some," South said.<br/><br/>Kat Walker said she had just been certified as a dietitian.<br/><br/>"The plant-based approach is kind of getting bigger in America which I think is great because it is a healthier option for our bodies. It has shown a lot more benefits like disease prevention and overall health. I think it's great that Disney is on board," Walker said.<br/><br/>Skye McGuffie was visiting with friends from Australia. The group said they were vegan and were excited to see the diet was growing in popularity in the United States.<br/><br/>"Super, super excited. There's quite a few Instagram accounts out there that follow around the specialized vegan options at Disney Resorts, so it sort of made life a lot easier now, especially because they're using a symbol on the menu and things like that," McGuffie said.<br/><br/>Staring in spring of 2020, all plant-based items on the resort's menu will be labeled with a leaf icon.</p>
