      </p>
      <p>A woman with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne">Melbourne</a> gangland links who convinced her lover to kill her fiance before having him killed too won’t get out of jail until she’s at least 71.</p>
      <p>Robyn Lindholm will be eligible for parole in 25 years after being sentenced for the murder of her live-in partner George Templeton in 2005.</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old woman is already serving decades behind bars for killing her “besotted” lover Wayne Amey, who she had recruited to kill Templeton.</p>
      <p>Lindholm told Templeton’s family he went missing, before she cut off contact and moved into a penthouse with Amey.</p>
      <p>“You were enjoying the high life at the expense of your former de facto’s life,” Justice Christopher Beale said in his sentencing remarks on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Templeton was likely drunk and vulnerable when he was assaulted and abducted from the Reservoir home he shared with Lindholm, Beale said.</p>
      <p>She concocted an alibi to be out of the house while Amey did her bidding.</p>
      <p>Templeton’s body has never been found, causing profound grief for his family who have begged Lindholm to tell them where his resting place is.</p>
      <p>“If we as a family could ask for anything, it is to know what happened to George and where his body lies,” his sister-in-law, Deborah Teazis, said at a pre-sentence hearing.</p>
      <p>“You have the option to do what’s right ... to tell us where George’s body is.”</p>
      <p>Despite their pleas, the family still don’t have any answers and their grief is profound, Beale said. “No sentence I can impose can undo the far-reaching and terrible consequences of your crime.”</p>
      <p>Eight years after she got Amey to kill Templeton, Lindholm arranged for him to be killed when their relationship soured.</p>
      <p>Lindholm had been addicted to ice and living out of the car when she met Torsten Trabert who was motivated by an “obsessive lust” when he killed for her.</p>
      <p>He ambushed Amey at a car park, bashed him with a baseball bat and threw him into a car boot before he was stabbed, strangled and dumped at a remote location.</p>
      <p>Lindholm, reportedly the ex-girlfriend of slain gangland identity Alphonse Gangitano, is already serving a 25-year-sentence for arranging the murder of Amey, which she pleaded guilty to.</p>
      <p>Beale jailed her for 28 years for the murder of Templeton, and her new non-parole period is 30 years.</p>
      <p>She will be 71 when she is first eligible to apply and in her 80s when the new sentence expires.</p>
