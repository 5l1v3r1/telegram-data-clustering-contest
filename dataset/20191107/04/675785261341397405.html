      <h1>11 times The Queen wore fur before agreeing to ban it from her wardrobe</h1>
      <h2>Her Majesty has sported fur on many occasions during her reign, however she has now ditched the controversial material</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T04:15:01+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 04:15</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Retter, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/emily-retter/</a></address>
      <p>She may be 93 but the Queen has proved she’s not set in her ways by taking the modern decision to go fur-free.</p>
      <p>After decades of real fur coats, Her Maj thrilled animal rights campaigners with the decision to switch to faux-fur in any new outfits, as we reported in yesterday’s Mirror.</p>
      <p>Her official dresser Angela Kelly revealed the move in her memoir, The Other Side of the Coin: The Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, and said mink trim had been removed from a favourite coat.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace confirmed the news, though the monarch may still wear old fur on existing outfits including ceremonial robes.</p>
      <p>Here, we look back at Liz’s fur fashions.</p>
      <h3>Coronation robes, 1953</h3>

      <p>The Queen won’t be able to trim the fur from historic regal robes as she has done with her personal coat.</p>
      <p>Here, she stands with her six maids of honour and Mistress of the Robes at her coronation at Westminster Abbey in London on June 2, 1953.</p>
      <p>The gown is embellished with a crimson velvet mantle edged with ermine. Not surprisingly, she needed a string of maids to help her take the strain.</p>
      <h3>Commonwealth tour, 1954</h3>
