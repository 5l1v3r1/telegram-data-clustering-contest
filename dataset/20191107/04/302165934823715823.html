      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 7 — The Penang state government is preparing an enactment to further control and prohibit the spread of other religions to Muslims in the state, Deputy Chief Minister I Ahmad Zakiyuddin Abd Rahman (PKR - Pinang Tunggal) said today.</p>
      <p>He said the legal technical committee secretary of the Penang Islamic Religious Council (MAINPP) proposed the enactment during a meeting on October 14.</p>
      <p>“On principle, the committee agreed with the proposal and the state Sharia prosecution department will review the draft enactment and make improvements to it by referring to other states that has a similar enactment and are enforcing it,” he said in reply to an oral question by Nor Hafizah Othman (BN - Permatang Berangan) at the state legislative assembly.</p>
      <p>On whether the state’s Islamic Affairs Department was taking appropriate actions against those who tried to spread other religions to Muslims, he said enforcement was as needed.</p>
      <p>“The enforcement team from the department will cooperate with the police to investigate and monitor any activities of attempts to convert Muslims to other religions,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said it is already an offence under Section 5 of the Penang Sharia Offences Enactment 1996 for anyone to spread non-Islamic beliefs, religions or doctrine to Muslims, with offenders to be tried in the civil courts.</p>
      <p>Those convicted of the offence are liable to a maximum fine of RM3,000 or up to two years’ imprisonment or both.</p>
      <p>“Since the section stresses that cases must be tried in the civil courts, enforcement actions must be conducted together with the police,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said both the Penang Islamic Affairs Department and the police are responsible for enforcing the law against this offence.</p>
