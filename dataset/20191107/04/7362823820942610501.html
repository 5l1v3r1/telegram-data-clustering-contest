      <p>“I’ve only been alone as I showered and I had to run out without a towel because I can’t be alone right now,” Dog said on the show soon after his wife's death, People reported. “That’s when I start thinking about things."</p>
      <p>He said that he didn’t realize 'psychologically” that she was gone and that he would never see her again.</p>

      <p>“I want to take a God— pain pill so bad,” he said. “I feel like if I did something to myself right now and passed away suicidal and I got to heaven and was like, ‘Hi honey,’ and would she go, ‘You d— a–, why would you do that?’ Or would she go, ‘Wow, you’re here.’ I’ll be like ‘Of course I’m here. You left me. I’m here.’ So, am I obligated to do that?”</p>
