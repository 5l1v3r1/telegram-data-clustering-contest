      <p>JOHANNESBURG, Nov 7 — Pangolins are under threat from illegal trafficking networks, conservationists said yesterday, as they urged southern African countries to step up protection of one of the world’s most smuggled mammals.</p>
      <p>Around 100,000 pangolins are plucked from the wild each year in Africa and Asia, according to conservation group WildAid.</p>
      <p>The flesh of these endangered scaled mammals is considered a delicacy in China and Vietnam, where their bones and blood are also used for traditional medicine.</p>
      <p>Demand for pangolin scales has exploded over the past decade, with seizures rising from 21 kilogrammes in 2011 to 68,000 kilogrammes this year, says WildAid.</p>
      <p>That trade became illegal when pangolins were placed under full protection from international trade by the wild fauna and flora CITES convention in 2016.</p>
      <p>But an EU-funded research project has found that criminal gangs have since tapped into the industry.</p>
      <p>“It is vital that we understand and prevent the illicit trade in pangolins before it is too late,” said researcher Richard Chelin in a statement yesterday.</p>
      <p>He added that strategies to combat illegal wildlife trafficking had focused mainly on iconic species such as elephants and rhinos, at the expense of lesser-known animals such as pangolins.</p>
      <p>“The threat to the rhino shows that early interventions are better than reactive measures at the height of a crisis,” said Chelin.</p>
      <p>Southern Africa remains the only region with a reasonably healthy pangolin population.</p>
      <p>Conservationists are lobbying the government to do more to protect the species.</p>
      <p>“A small fine or a few days in jail is not a deterrent for organised criminals in a high-value industry,” said South Africa environmental inspector Fanie Masango.</p>
      <p>While hunting elephant and rhino in South Africa can lead to a 100,000 rand (RM27,900) fine and a ten-year prison sentence, a pangolin hunter can get away with 1,500 rand. — AFP</p>
