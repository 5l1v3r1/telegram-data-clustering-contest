      <p>LA PAZ, Nov 7 — A student was killed in Bolivian protests yesterday amid increasing pressure on President Evo Morales to resign over opposition claims that he rigged his recent re-election.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old student died of injuries sustained in clashes between pro- and anti-government demonstrators in the central city of Cochabamba, a doctor at the local hospital told AFP. Some 20 other people were wounded in the fighting, some seriously, Ombudsman Nadia Cruz said.</p>
      <p>The fatality brings to three the death toll in clashes following the controversial October 20 election that saw Morales, 60, win re-election in a first round of voting — but only after a pause and an abrupt shift in the vote count in his favor, which his opponents have branded as fraudulent.</p>
      <p>Morales, first elected president in 2006, is seeking to remain in power until 2025 after he took legal action to get around constitutional term limits.</p>
      <p>He tweeted “deep regret” over the death yesterday, and described the student as “an innocent victim of violence promoted by political groups that encourage racial hatred among Bolivian brothers.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Luis Fernando Camacho, an opposition leader based in the Santa Cruz region, flew to La Paz where he was joined by ex-president Jorge Quiroga (2001-2002) and opposition politician Gustavo Pedraza with plans to deliver a letter to the president demanding his resignation.</p>
      <p>The powerful Catholic Church cautioned against such an open challenge to Morales’ authority.</p>
      <p>“Asking for the president’s resignation is a radical measure,” said Sucre Archbishop Jesus Juarez.</p>

        <b>Homemade bazookas</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Cochabamba clashes took place after members of farmers’ unions, mainly women, began an effort early in the day to clear opposition roadblocks that have stopped traffic for several days.</p>
      <p>Rival groups fought pitched battles in the city with rocks and sticks. Some protesters launched firecrackers from homemade bazookas. The town hall in neighboring Vinto, a stronghold of Morales’ ruling MAS party, was burned down.</p>
      <p>“Evo, friend, the people are with you!” supporters chanted before clashing with opponents, mainly students, in a city square.</p>
      <p>Anti-Morales protests were also held Wednesday in the cities of Santa Cruz, Sucre, Tarija and Potosi, shutting down state offices and companies.</p>
      <p>Bolivia’s state oil company warned of likely fuel shortages because of the protests. “It is impossible to supply service stations,” it said in a statement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Conservative leader</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conservative opposition leader Camacho, 40, has called on military support to oust Morales from office.</p>
      <p>Morales, speaking at a naval ceremony yesterday, insisted that the military must “serve the people” and support his government.</p>
      <p>Up to now Bolivia’s armed forces have stayed neutral in the electoral dispute — and calling on the military to solve political problems is a highly controversial move.</p>
      <p>Bolivia saw numerous military uprisings and dictatorships during its republican life before civilian rule was established in 1982.</p>
      <p>Carlos Mesa, who ran second against Morales in the October polls, has called for a new vote to be held. — AFP</p>
