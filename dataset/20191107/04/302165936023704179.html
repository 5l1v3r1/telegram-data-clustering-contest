      <h1>Azmin urges PLUS to review closure of TnG reload booths, provide alternatives</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 7 — PLUS Malaysia Berhad should reconsider its decision to stop the Touch ‘n Go reload service at its toll plazas along its highways, Datuk Seri Azmin Ali said today.</p>
      <p>The economic affairs minister said the highway concessionaire that is partly government owned through Khazanah Bhd should take note of public unhappiness with the abrupt decision.</p>
      <p>“I hope the management would review the decision by taking note of highway users views and they should provide alternatives to them,” he told reporters at Parliament.</p>
      <p>PLUS announced it is halting the cash card reload service along the highway on November 1, attributing the decision as a bid to cut traffic congestion at the toll plazas in the northern region (between Hutan Kampung and Ipoh Utara) and the southern region (between Seremban and Skudai).</p>
      <p>The company added that this is to ensure the safety of PLUS customer service agents, as there have been several cases where heavy vehicles crashed into the toll booths.</p>
