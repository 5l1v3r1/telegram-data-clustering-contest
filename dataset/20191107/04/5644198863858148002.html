      <p>THE HAGUE: A pilot accidentally set off a hijack alarm on a plane at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Wednesday, triggering a huge security operation by Dutch police.</p>
      <p>Spanish airline Air Europa "deeply" apologised for the incident on board its flight from the Dutch capital to Madrid, which saw emergency vehicles swarm around the plane.</p>

      <p>"False alarm. In the flight Amsterdam-Madrid this afternoon was activated, by mistake, a warning that triggers protocols on hijackings at the airport," the airline tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Nothing has happened, all passengers are safe and sound waiting to fly soon. We deeply apologise."</p>

      <p>The plane was carrying 27 passengers, Dutch media said.</p>
      <p>Pictures from the scene showed police vehicles and ambulances clustered around the plane while parts of the airport were cordoned off by the false alarm.</p>
      <p>Schiphol is one of Europe's busiest airports, handling more than 70 million passengers a year, according to its website.</p>
