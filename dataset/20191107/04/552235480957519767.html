      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T04:30:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McGivern, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcgivern/</a></address>
      <p>Sir <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/meet-rod-stewarts-adorable-rescue-20819428">Rod Stewart</a> travelled to Rome on Monday from his London home with Glaswegian songwriter John McLaughlin.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-superfan-hands-pope-club-20825176">Celtic mad</a> legend told the Daily Record: “It has been a complete delight to be in Rome with all these <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-fans-enjoying-rome-despite-20824394">dedicated Celtic fans</a>.</p>
      <p>“I identify with the club and its fans so strongly and I’ve spent a lot of time chatting to people and getting photos taken and just enjoying the good vibe. Trips like this are what it’s all about for the fans and I love it as much as they do.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“The supporters are doing Celtic proud by coming over here in such great numbers. They are a great bunch and they are so often the 12th man for the team when it comes down to it.</p>
      <p>“I read that there might be more Celtic fans than Lazio fans in the stadium and that made me feel really proud.”</p>
      <p>Sir Rod’s latest tour, kicking off this month, includes three Scottish dates at the SSE Hydro.</p>
      <p>He said: “Scottish gigs are always so special to me and I mean that sincerely. I’m looking forward to getting to Glasgow again.”</p>
