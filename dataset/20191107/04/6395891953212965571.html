      <h1>Move Over Nike, Call Under Armour</h1>

      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - Move over, Nike. Call Under Armour, now.</p>
      <p>Boston College graduate transfer guard Derryck Thornton made a quick cut near the foul line driving toward to the lane and split the bottom of his left Under Armour sneaker during the first half of Wednesday night's season-opening 77-70 win over Wake Forest.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I was surprised," he said. "I thought it was something with my foot. It didn't hurt. I looked down and saw the shoe was messed up. I told the ref: 'My shoe's messed up.'"</p>
      <p>It didn't seem to bother him at all. The transfer from USC scored a career-high 23 points, going 7 of 14 from the floor, hitting 2 of his 3 shots from beyond the 3-point line.</p>
      <p>So where is the ruined shoe, now?</p>
      <p>"Trash somewhere," he said. "It just busted. I'm not really sure."</p>
      <p>When the 6-foot-3 guard backed out and dribbled out to midcourt, he looked down and the bottom of his sneaker was slightly hanging off. During a timeout, he took off the white sneakers and put on a pair of maroon ones and stayed in the game.</p>
      <p>He warmed up in the maroon pair, played the start of the game with the white ones that had the left one split, and had to go to his backups.</p>
      <p>"I've been wearing them for quite a while," he said of the white shoes, with one now in the trash. "The red ones, I just started wearing, so I just started breaking them in. I didn't feel comfortable. I warmed up in the red ones. They didn't feel comfortable, so I went back to the faithful ones and they ended up gripping."</p>
      <p>Last season, then-Duke star Zion Williamson made a quick move at the foul line against North Carolina and suffered a mild sprain of his right knee when his left Nike sneaker came apart, forcing him into an awkward-almost-split.</p>
      <p>Thornton remembered how big a deal that became nationally.</p>
      <p>"I think I was at a restaurant with my team," he said. "I remember the whole restaurant went crazy. I don't think mine was as exciting."</p>
      <p>He understands it can happen and now he might be a footnote on Twitter compared to Williamson's sneaker moment.</p>
      <p>"I think it just happens," Thornton said. "They're both great companies. Kind of happens when you're playing hard out there."</p>
      <p>Williamson was the NBA's first overall pick by New Orleans in June.</p>
