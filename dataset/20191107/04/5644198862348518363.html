      <p>MADRID: Spain's soccer federation (RFEF) has pledged 1.15 million euros to help pay the salaries of women's top-flight players in order to try to prevent a planned strike, it said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The decision followed a meeting between the players and RFEF president Luis Rubiales.</p>

      <p>"The RFEF will pay a part of the salary of players in the Primera Division Iberdrola in order to unblock the stand off that currently exists between clubs and athletes," said an RFEF statement.</p>
      <p>"The RFEF will guarantee a minimum salary of 16,000 euros per year to 18 players of each squad and strike a general deal, after existing television contracts end, that will allow it to raise that minimum salary to up to 18,000 or 20,000 euros."</p>
      <p>The statement added that in exchange for its financial contribution, clubs had to end the impasse which has prevented women's top-flight matches being broadcast on national television this season.</p>
      <p>Last month, 93per cent of players across the division's 16 clubs voted to go on an indefinite strike from Nov. 16 over a disagreement about pay and conditions.</p>
