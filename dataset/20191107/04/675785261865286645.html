      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Gaga shared her sorrow at having to cancel her Las Vegas show as she has bronchitis and a sinus infection</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T04:07:32+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 04:07</time> by <a rel="author">James Brinsford, https://www.facebook.com/james.brinsford</a></address>
      <p>Lady Gaga fans were left 'devastated' after the singer pulled the plug on her Las Vegas show just 20 minutes before she was due on stage.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Oscar-winning singer is in the middle of her two-year residency in the Park Theatre at Park MGM, in which she is reportedly earning $100 million (£77.8 million) for an initial run of 74 performances, entitled Enigma.</p>
      <p>The singer announced on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> story to her 37.8 million followers that she had to cancel her performance on Wednesday at the last minute.</p>
      <p>She posted a pic of her laying back and taking in air as she revealed the reason why she was too ill to perform.</p>

      <p>Gaga wrote: "I’m so devastated I can’t perform tonight for so many people who travelled to come to see me.</p>
      <p>"I have a sinus infection and bronchitis and feel very sick and sad I never want to let you down.</p>
      <p>"I’m just to weak and ill too perform tonight. I love you little monsters I’ll make it up to you. I promise. [sic]"</p>
      <p>With fans taking their seats for the performance, there were a lot of disgruntled punters that took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to share their frustration at what had happened.</p>

      <p>One unhappy fan had made an epic journey to see Gaga perform. They tweeted: "Flew 7000 miles to see @ladygaga in Vegas and she cancels 20 minutes before the show... I love you Gaga but I am f***ing devastated #GagaVegas #Enigma"</p>
      <p>They told Mirror Online that they were receiving a refund but had booked the show after Gaga had cancelled dates during 2017's Joanne World Tour.</p>
      <p>Alex Rose had flown to the States from the UK and explained what was happening.</p>

      <p>She said: "They’re refunding us but unfortunately we leave Vegas tomorrow so can’t do another date. The other dates are sold out anyway so they won’t let us reschedule.</p>
      <p>"We booked this holiday back in December purely to see Gaga too after she cancelled the Joanne tour.</p>
      <p>"This would’ve been my eighth Gaga show and I love her enough to see her again every time I can. I definitely won’t leave the UK to do it now though.</p>
      <p>"I am losing faith in her a little, this is actually my third cancelled Gaga show."</p>
      <p>The singer was inundated with 'get well soon' messages and it is currently unclear whether she will be well enough to perform on Friday, the next date on her schedule.</p>
