      <h2>Juventus boss insists CR7 was not angry at being hauled off in crucial Champions League victory</h2>

      <p>Juventus boss Maurizio Sarri has explained Cristiano Ronaldo's furious reaction to being substituted during his side's 2-1 win over Lokomotiv Moscow on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Ronaldo</a> appeared unhappy when he was hauled off in the 82nd minute of Juve's victory in Russia, which guaranteed their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>But Sarri said the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> man was not angry at the decision to sub him - insisting the 34-year-old's reaction was simply frustration at a niggling injury.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo had been close to scoring his 128th Champions League goal in the game, but former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> midfielder Aaron Ramsey followed up his team-mate's free-kick to stab the ball home after it was fumbled by Lokomotiv's keeper.</p>
      <p>The five-times Ballon d'Or winner was replaced by Paulo Dybala with the score still 1-1, but Douglas Costa's injury-time winner meant <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> ensured their last-16 spot with two games still to play in the group stage.</p>

      <p>Sarri said he decided to take Ronaldo off to protect him after monitoring an issue the Portuguese ace had complained of at half-time.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was angry because he's not okay," Sarri told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"He's had a niggle in his knee for the past few days, which is overloading his thigh, which tires out too much.</p>

      <p>"At the break he was already worried about it. Then, when I saw him make a movement I didn't like when he was accelerating I took him off because I was scared that he might do himself real harm."</p>
      <p>The Juventus coach admitted: "It wasn't our best game, we left too much space for our rivals counter-attacks, but I'm happy with the character we showed. I saw the team wanted to win at all costs."</p>
