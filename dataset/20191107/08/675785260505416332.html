      <h1>Arsene Wenger told he is too old to be a manager amid Bayern Munich interest</h1>
      <h2>The former Arsenal manager is the hot favourite to take over at the Allianz Arena - but there are doubts over him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:41:59+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Flanagan, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/aaron-flanagan/</a></address>
      <p>Arsene Wenger has been told that he is too old to still be managing at the very top level of football.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> boss is the favourite to take over as manager of Bayern Munich following the sacking of Niko Kovac earlier this week.</p>
      <p>But former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and France defender Marcel Desailly thinks that Wenger's day has already passed.</p>
      <p>Wenger has been out of management since he called time on his 19-year reign at Arsenal in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>He insists that he is ready and raring to go with a new management role in football and has publicly stated his interest in taking over at Bayern.</p>

      <p>Desailly, however, remains unconvinced.</p>
      <p>"No, he should not be in the dugout. It's not for him any more," Desailly told BeIN Sports.</p>
      <p>"He has great possibilities to restructure, to build up the philosophy of the club, towards the first team and the academy.</p>
      <p>"But as a frontline, we don't see him anymore. He's 70 years old."</p>
      <p>Bayern appear set to offer Wenger a deal to take over until the end of the season, with talks expected to take place this week in a bid to finalise a deal.</p>

      <p>The German champions had wanted Ajax boss Erik ten Hag and PSG chief Thomas Tuchel as options, but both are unwilling to leave their jobs at the present moment.</p>
      <p>Wenger speaks German fluently and already knows Bayern winger Serge Gnabry, who he managed during his time at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has already turned down job offers since leaving Arsenal, including a role as a technical director with FIFA.</p>
