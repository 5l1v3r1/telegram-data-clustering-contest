      <h1>Paul Pogba 'destined' to leave Man Utd if they miss out on Champions League</h1>
      <h2>The Frenchman was believed to be close to a United exit in the summer, with Real Madrid and former club Juventus both said to be keen on the World Cup winner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:50:59+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:50</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Paul Pogba is certain to leave Manchester United if they miss out on the Champions League again, according to a former colleague at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> .</p>
      <p>The Frenchman was said to be pushing for an Old Trafford exit in the summer, just three years after rejoining the club in a then world record £89million deal from Turin.</p>
      <p>Both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and former club Juve were pushing to sign the midfielder, but he ended up staying at United despite publicly expressing his desire for a new challenge.</p>
      <p>Pogba has had an injury-hit 2019/20 campaign, only featuring in five Premier League games as United have struggled to 10th place in the table.</p>

      <p>In an interview with Italian media outlet Tuttosport, the former Juventus chief scout Javier Ribalta - who these days is the sporting director at Russian outfit Zenit St Petersburg - tipped the Italian giants to make another move for Pogba.</p>
      <p>Assessing their attempts to bring in another big name after the capture of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cristiano-ronaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> last year, Ribalta - who left Juve in 2017, one year after Pogba - was asked about the possibility of signing one of Pogba, Kylian Mbappe, Erling Braut Haaland or Joao Felix.</p>
      <p>And he stuck his neck on the line when it came to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> man.</p>

      <p>“None of the four looks simple to me, but I would bet a pizza with a friend on Pogba’s return," he said. "Without Champions (League), Paul is destined to leave Manchester United.”</p>
      <p>Ahead of United facing Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday, Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has suggested that Pogba will be <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-names-paul-20827312">ready to return from his ankle injury after the international break</a> when his side go to Sheffield United.</p>
