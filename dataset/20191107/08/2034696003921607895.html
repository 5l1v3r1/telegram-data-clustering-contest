      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/01/robert-de-niro-and-al-pacino-were-not-doing-this-ever-again"><i>The Guardian</i></a>, Pesci’s co-star in <i>The</i> Irishman, Robert De Niro, explained <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/this-is-it-robert-de-niro-doesnt-think-hell-make-another-movie-with-al-pacino-and-martin-scorsese-2563440#06Vl45hu0JL6z2e9.99">how he convinced his long-term collaborator to work on the film, despite Pesci having retired.</a></p>
      <p>He went on to say he didn’t think he, Al Pacino and Scorsese would another movie together again.</p>
      <p>“I said: ‘Come on, we’re not going to do this ever again.’” De Niro recalled. “It was tough enough to get it done, to get the money to do it and everything.”</p>
      <p>He continued, looking to the future of his work with Pacino, Scorsese and Pesci: “I don’t see us putting on a movie like this. I hope we do other films together, but like this? Not likely. This is it.”</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro">a four-star review of <i>The Irishman</i></a>, <i>NME</i>‘s Greg Wetherall said: “If this is to be Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese’s final fling together, then they couldn’t wish to end on a better note. The director’s 26th feature film is a meditative and classy offering.</p>
      <p>“Hollywood’s old cronies are still the real deal – magnetic, riveting and unique. Let’s hope we see them again soon.”</p>
