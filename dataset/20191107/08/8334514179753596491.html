      <p>(Reuters) - China’s Bio-Thera Solutions Ltd has won a regulatory approval for its version of AbbVie Inc’s blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis treatment Humira, paving the way for the first such biosimilar to enter the world’s second-largest drug market.</p>
      <p>Humira is the world’s top-selling drug, with sales of $20 billion last year, but now faces competition from cheaper versions in Europe and a 2023 expiration of its patents in the United States, by far the most profitable market.</p>
      <p>The National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), in a statement on its website on Thursday, said Bio-Thera’s Qletli “was highly similar to the approved reference drug in terms of quality, safety and effectiveness.”</p>
      <p>The drug has been approved for the treatment of three autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and plaque psoriasis, Bio-Thera said in separate a statement <a href="https://www.bio-thera.com/EN/ShowNews.asp?id=60.">here</a></p>
      <p>“The NMPA approval of Qletli is a very important milestone for our biosimilar portfolio, providing an new affordable treatment option for patients in China with several types of autoimmune diseases,” Bio-Thera CEO Shengfeng Li said.</p>
