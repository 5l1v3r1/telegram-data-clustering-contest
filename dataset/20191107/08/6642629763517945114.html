      <p>The investigation concluded that the men had killed 16 fellow fishermen on their boat and then fled to South Korea, Seoul's unification ministry said.</p>
      <p>The two men were deported to the North via the truce village of Panmunjom on Thursday after informing Pyongyang of the plan, ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min told reporters.</p>
      <p>"If they had been incorporated into our society, it was judged they would pose a threat to the lives and safety of the people," Lee said.</p>
      <p>Details of the killing or the boat's whereabouts were not provided.</p>
      <p>More than 30,000 North Koreans have escaped from the reclusive state to the South since the two were separated by war more than 65 years ago, according to government data - many driven by prolonged economic hardship.</p>
      <p>The defectors are interrogated by South Korean intelligence authorities upon arrival and spend about three months in a government-run facility for re-education before they are discharged into society.</p>
