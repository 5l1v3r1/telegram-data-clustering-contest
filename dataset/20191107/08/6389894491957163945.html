      <h1>Aston Martin swings to £13.5m loss as it blames 'soft' UK demand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:05:31+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:05</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Aston Martin sank to a loss in its third quarter as demand for its luxury cars dried up, it revealed today.</p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p>James Bond’s favourite car maker found little love from other buyers as it swung to a <b>loss before tax of £13.5m</b> in the three months to the end of September. That compared with a £3.1m profit this time last year.</p>
      <p>It came as buyer demand stagnated, with <b>revenue falling</b> 11 per cent year on year to <b>£250.1m</b>.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin <b>only built 1,497 cars</b> over the quarter, a <b>16 per cent fall</b> from last year’s 1,776 units.</p>
      <p><b>Net debt</b> stood at <b>£800m</b>, <b>up significantly</b> from December 2018’s £560m but marginally down from £811m a year ago.</p>
      <h3>What Aston Martin said</h3>
      <p>CEO Andy Palmer said:</p>
      <blockquote>Tough trading conditions, particularly in the UK and Europe, persist and whilst retail sales have grown 13% year-to-date, wholesale volumes remain under pressure.<br/><br/>We remain pleased with the performance of DB11 and DBS Superleggera, however, the segment of the market in which Vantage competes is declining, and notwithstanding a growing market-share, Vantage demand remains weaker than our original plans.<br/><br/>As a consequence, total wholesale volumes are down year-on-year as we balance growth, brand positioning and dealer inventories. Additionally, we are taking actions to control our costs through an efficiency programme.<br/><br/>DBX development is progressing well, with the global launch in Beijing on 20 November. The first production trial build has been completed, and St Athan commissioned, with start of production due in Q2 2020 as planned.<br/><br/>We are delighted with the early reception the car has received from customers and initial orders are being placed at the confidential events.<br/><br/><br/>The launch of Vantage AMR and Roadster are also on track, and all 19 DB4 GT Zagato Continuations are planned to be delivered by the end of this year. We are working hard to deliver the year as we head into our peak trading season.</blockquote>
