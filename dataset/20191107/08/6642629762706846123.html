      <p>Mauritians will have their first chance to decide if Prime Minister <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/mauritius-prime-minister-dissolves-parliament-calls-election-191006133032325.html">Pravind Jugnauth</a> should continue to rule since he was hand-picked for the job when his father stepped down more than two years ago.</p>
      <p>Nearly a million people are registered to vote in the parliamentary election in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/mauritius.html">Mauritius</a>, a stable democracy in the Indian Ocean, on Thursday. The more than 300 polling stations opened at 6am local time (02:00 GMT) on Thursday and are due to close at 6pm local time (14:00 GMT)</p>
      <p>Jugnauth succeeded his father, Anerood Jugnauth, as prime minister without a popular vote when the older man stood down in 2017, two years ahead of schedule.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old is asking voters to judge him on his short time in office, pointing to his record on modernising public infrastructure and economic reforms in the former British colony.</p>
      <p>But he faces two opponents who say his appointment to the island's top job amounted to little more than nepotism.</p>
      <p>The ballot marks the first opportunity for Mauritians to choose whether he deserves a mandate. Counting begins on Friday, with results expected later that day.</p>
      <p>Observers expect a smooth election in the prosperous country of 1.3 million that has evolved from a poor, agriculture-based economy, to one of Africa's wealthiest nations and financial services hub.</p>
      <p>Campaigning lasted for a furious two weeks, with Mauritius bedecked in the flags and colours of the opposing parties.</p>
      <p>Mauritius, comprising four volcanic islands roughly 1,800 kilometres (1,100 miles) off the eastern coast of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html">Africa</a>, is predominantly Hindu but has sizeable Christian and Muslim minorities.</p>
      <h3>New alliances</h3>
      <p>For the first time in decades, three distinct political blocs will vie for power in the legislative elections. New alliances could be likely if none can clinch an absolute majority.</p>
      <p>Jugnauth heads the centre-right Morisian Alliance, Navin Ramgoolam, a two-time former prime minister leads the centre-left National Alliance and one of his former allies, Paul Berenger, is going out alone with his Mauritian Militant Movement.</p>
      <p>Berenger, who briefly served as prime minister from 2003 to 2005, has also denounced dynastic politics and accused Jugnauth of presiding over "scandals of all kinds".</p>
      <p>The prime minister has banked on the strength of the Mauritius economy - it grew 3.8 percent in 2018 - and key reforms such as introducing a minimum wage and hiking pensions.</p>
      <p>Mauritius has increasingly come under fire for helping global companies avoid paying taxes - often in poor African nations - and was, until October, on a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a> watch list.</p>
      <p>General unemployment, while low compared with the rest of the continent, also remains high among youth at 22 percent, and inequality seems to be on the rise.</p>
      <p>Voters have to choose 62 MPs - 60 from the main island of Mauritius, and two from Rodrigues, a small island some 600 kilometres (370 miles) to the east.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission then appoints eight other representatives from among those not elected, but who received a high number of votes, to rebalance the distribution of seats between parties and communities in the national assembly.</p>
