      <h1>Old McDonald's: Aussie mates show off burger bought in 1995</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:13:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Holly Robertson, AFP</a></address>
      <p>A McDonald's burger bought in 1995 and kept in an Australian shed for years has never decomposed, according to two men who now refer to the quarter-century Quarter Pounder as their "mate."</p>
      <p>Casey Dean, 39, and Eduards Nits, 38, claim they ordered the Quarter Pounder with cheese from a McDonald's outlet in Adelaide as teenagers -- and have hung onto it ever since.</p>
      <p>"Being teenagers we ordered a truckload of food, and it was just way too much," Dean told AFP. "It started a chain of events where we were joking 'imagine if we kept this forever', and here we are."</p>
      <p>Though the burger has shrunk a little from its original size, its shape remains intact, there are no signs of mould, and it doesn't smell.</p>
      <p>"Even the sesame seeds are still on there, just a few have been knocked off," Dean said.</p>
      <p>The men say their relationship with the Quarter Pounder will span 25 years by November 2020, a milestone even many marriages fail to reach.</p>
      <p>"We have been talking about taking him back to his birthplace, just go see the staff there and see if he recognizes anyone," Dean said.</p>
      <p>Dubbing it the "Senior Burger" and referring to it repeatedly as their "mate", the men have created social media profiles for the burger and even wrote a song about it.</p>
      <p>They believe it is the oldest known McDonald's burger in the world, outranking a prominent decade-old cheeseburger displayed in a glass case in Iceland and live-streamed online to thousands of viewers.</p>
      <p>Storage for the ancient Aussie burger has been rather less considered, though it has mostly been kept under lock and key in a box made of timber and cardboard.</p>
      <p>That box spent about a decade jumbled up with clothing inside a shed in Adelaide, where temperatures regularly top 30 degrees Celsius in summer.</p>
      <p>When they eventually went to check on it, Dean said even rats had turned their noses up at the morsel.</p>
      <p>"The rats had actually eaten through the plastic bag, heaps of clothes, got into the box and they'd left the burger," he said.</p>
      <p>"Our mate was safe."</p>
      <p>Dean said he understood why some might be skeptical about their claim, but argues the old-school packaging -- waxy paper and a cardboard ring -- accurately date the burger to the mid-1990s.</p>
      <p>He is steadfast that the pair would never part with it despite fielding offers from around the world when it first came to public attention in 2015.</p>
      <p>A McDonald's spokeswoman did not dispute the assertion, saying the question of why some of its burgers did not decay came up "from time to time" but there was a "simple explanation".</p>
      <p>"The reason why our burgers sometimes don't go mouldy when left out at room temperature, in a dry environment, is that once the food is cooked there isn't enough moisture to support bacterial growth to break it down," she said.</p>
      <p>"Instead, it simply dries out."</p>
      <p>She advised the best way to enjoy the firm's food was "when it's hot and tasty.‚Äù</p>
