      <p>Investigators determined he had fallen through a soft area of ground in his yard, then plummeted down a lava tube, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Lava tubes are large conduits beneath the ground that are formed by flowing lava. When they’re extinct, the tubes do not have lava in them, but form large tunnels beneath the earth’s surface.</p>
      <p>Fire department crews pulled the man’s body from about 22 feet beneath the ground, police said.</p>
