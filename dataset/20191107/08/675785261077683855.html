      <h1>Nate Diaz hints at retirement amid Conor McGregor and Jorge Masvidal rematch speculation</h1>
      <h2>Nate Diaz was offered an immediate rematch by Jorge Masvidal after their fight was controversially stopped last week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T08:27:52+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Nate Diaz has hinted he has retired from UFC.</p>
      <p>Diaz, 34, suffered defeat to Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244 last weekend.</p>
      <p>Diaz suffered two nasty cuts to the right side of his face - one above and one below the eye - in the early stages of his huge BMF title showdown, which was controversially stopped at the end of round three.</p>
      <p>He has since been handed a 90 day medical suspension.</p>
      <p>Since the defeat, there has been talk over a rematch between Diaz and Masvidal, while speculation over him facing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> again has not gone away.</p>

      <p>But Diaz took to social media on Thursday to suggest he has decided to call it a day.</p>
      <p>"F*** a rematch this s*** was over before it started. I’m goin on out on tour. Peace out fight game."</p>
      <p>Diaz is unable to contemplate a return to the octagon until February at the earliest and it now appears he has decided to walk away.</p>

      <p>Masvidal offered Diaz an immediate rematch with both fighters upset by what they felt was a premature stoppage in an exciting fight.</p>
      <p>A third fight between Diaz and McGregor has continued to be talked up after two previous bouts between the pair.</p>
      <p>Diaz previously beat the Irishman at UFC 196 in March 2016, before McGregor avenged the defeat months later at UFC 202.</p>
