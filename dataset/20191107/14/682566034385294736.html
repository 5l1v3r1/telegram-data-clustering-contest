      <p>Zagreb - Defending champions Croatia will be without <b>Marin Cilic</b> in the Davis Cup finals later this month after the former US Open winner announced his withdrawal on Thursday because of a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Croatia, who beat previous winners France in last year's final, play the inaugural match in Madrid against Russia on November 18.</p>
      <p>"My recurring knee injury has continued to give me problems, and as the season progressed it was becoming more evident that surgery was inevitable," Cilic, world number 39, wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The "rehab work was successful enough that surgery is not necessary at this stage," he continued.</p>
      <p>"However, I will need to undergo a few minor interventions which will keep me off the tennis court for a longer period and unfortunately means I will not be able to compete at the Davis Cup this month."</p>
      <p>Adding that he was "extremely disappointed", the 31-year-old Croatian said he would dedicate himself to getting back into shape to kick off the 2020 season "healthier, more prepared, and more motivated than ever".</p>
      <p>Cilic was supposed to play in a squad of five Croatian players which includes Borna Coric, Mate Pavic, Ivan Dodig and Nikola Mektic.</p>
      <p>According to the Sportske Novosti daily paper, he will be replaced by veteran Ivo Karlovic, 40.</p>
      <p>Davis Cup's new 18-team format has replaced the former World Group.</p>
      <p>The nations have been split into six three-team groups, with the winners and two best runners-up advancing to the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Russia and Croatia have been drawn alongside Spain in Group B.</p>
