      <p>TOKYO: Tokyo's Haneda airport was grappling with a water supply cutoff at one of its terminals on Thursday (Nov 7), with passengers washing their hands with bottled water and some restaurants suspending operations, officials said.</p>
      <p>A bar at Terminal 2, which handles domestic flights, was serving wine in plastic cups because it could not wash its glasses, footage on public broadcaster NHK showed.</p>

      <p>Flight operations were not disrupted. But the water has been shut off since Wednesday, with no timing for when the taps would turn back on.</p>
      <p>"We cannot estimate when the water supply will be restored" at Terminal 2, said Kyosuke Hirano, a spokesman at Japan Airport Terminal, which runs Haneda, the world's fourth-busiest airport.</p>
      <p>Toilets, however, have not been affected because they use a different water system, another Japan Airport official said.</p>
      <p>Airport Facilities, which provides water to the airport, said it suspended the water supply to domestic terminals 1 and 2 on Wednesday morning after a complaint of salty-tasting water. The international terminal was not affected.</p>
      <p>Airport Facilities said it restored water service to Terminal 1 on Wednesday afternoon, but was still investigating the cause of the salty taste.</p>
      <p>Haneda Airport was the world's fourth-busiest airport by passenger traffic in 2017, according to Airport Council International.</p>
