      <h1>The Elder Scrolls Online is free to play for a week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:43:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/ian-boudreau/" target="_blank">Ian Boudreau</a></address>
      <p>You can play <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> for free until Wednesday. Bethesda is holding a free play event in its sprawling MMO, and it gives you access to the full base game for a week.</p>
      <p>The free play event started yesterday and runs until November 13 at 10 am EST / 3 pm GMT. If you've played in any of the past free play events, your character and progression will carry over into this one, but if you're creating a new ESO account, you'll get 500 crowns to spend in the in-game store, which is a nice little bonus.</p>
      <p>Bethesda says this event gives you access to four starting classes: Nightblade, Templar, Dragonknight, and Sorcerer. You'll be able to explore 23 zones while pursuing the game's main storyline and the Mages Guild and Fighters Guild quests.</p>
      <p>To get going, head over to the <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/freeplay">event page</a> and select your platform, then follow the instructions to download The Elder Scrolls Online client. It's worth a try, if you've never playedâ€”after a rocky first year, The Elder Scrolls Online has found its footing and become one of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-mmos/">best MMOs</a> out there.</p>
