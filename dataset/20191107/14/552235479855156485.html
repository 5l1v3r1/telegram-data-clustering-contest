      <p>Five Lazio fans have been arrested after two <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> supporters were stabbed outside an Irish pub in Rome.</p>
      <p>Reports emerged that a number of masked Lazio ‘ultras’ <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/two-celtic-fans-stabbed-rome-20829537">allegedly attacked</a> groups of Hoops fans near Flann O’Brien’s at Via Nazionale in the Italian capital on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Several Celtic fans were drinking inside the pub when two men suffered stab wounds nearby.</p>
      <p>Now, Italian Police have confirmed that five Lazio fans have been arrested following the alleged attack.</p>

      <p>Officers in the city also arrested two Celtic fans. It is unclear if they were involved in the same incident.</p>
      <p>One of the men injured in the incident remains in hospital while it is understood that an Irish man discharged himself after treatment.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: "Our consular staff have visited a British man who has been admitted to hospital in Rome to offer him support, and are in contact with the Italian medical services.”</p>
      <p>Celtic Football Club previously said that it will <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-release-statement-after-two-20831393">offer both men support</a> .</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the club said: “We can confirm that two fans have been injured after being stabbed last night.</p>
      <p>"Both are now in hospital and will receive every support from the club and the British consulate in Rome.</p>
      <p>"Again we would strongly advise supporters to closely follow all guidance issued by the club.”</p>
      <p>The violence comes as tensions boiled over ahead of Celtic’s crunch Europa League tie with Lazio on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Thousands of Celtic fans have travelled to Rome to roar on the Hoops, despite fears of ambush from violent Lazio ultras .</p>
      <p>Most of the 9,000 travelling supporters had booked for the Italian capital before it emerged that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lazio-slam-fans-celtic-behaviour-20724205">fascist elements</a> of the Lazio support are hell bent on trouble.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Hoops fans were advised by the Foreign Office not to wear their club colours while visiting Rome after Celtic’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-2-lazio-1-3-20716068">2-1 win</a> in Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Just last week Lazio fans caused outrage by making fascist open handed salutes while marching through Glasgow city centre.</p>
      <p>Celtic’s own ultra fans, The Green Brigade, countered by making a massive banner depicting fascist leader <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/celtic-issue-fans-safety-plan-20810637">Benito Mussolini</a> hanging upside down - depicting how he was treated after his death in Milan in 1945.</p>
      <p>Its message of “follow your leader” brought a UEFA charge for Celtic and led the club to believe the provocation might put fans in danger.</p>
      <p>Celtic FC issued detailed guidance on fan safety after considering that the potential risks in Rome exceeded anything else the club has faced in recent years.</p>
