      <h2>Aston Villa latest news and views | Jurgen Klopp has moved to address claims ahead of his Liverpool side's Aston Villa clash in the Carabao Cup at Villa Park next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:59:49+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:59</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has denied he will send Under-23s boss Neil Critchley to manage Liverpool for the Carabao Cup quarter-final clash with</p>
      <p>Reports <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-making-massive-decision-controversial-17214615">have suggested the Reds boss could delegate his managerial duties</a> for the Villa Park clash because his side are in Club World Cup action a day later.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed earlier this week that the reigning European champions will send two different sides to each game <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-aston-villa-17207617">to avoid a major fixture pile-up that could have seen the match played</a> as late as the first week of January.</p>
      <p>Klopp won the Champions League with Liverpool in June and his side are top of the Premier League by six points but even he can't be in two places at once so he might have to take a rain check on the December 17 clash in B6 with the Club World Cup taking place in Qatar.</p>
