        <b>A Bangladeshi student has been killed in a road accident in the US state of Pennsylvania.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The woman was identified as Meherun Chowdhury, 19, a student of Drexel University in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>The accident took place in Philadelphia’s Kobes Cricke 59 and Chestnut Street early Tuesday, according to police.</p>
      <p>“A car driven by an 18-year-old boy veered out of control and swerved into the left lane. Meherun’s BMW smashed into a school bus in her attempts to avoid collision with another vehicle,” Millbourne Borough Council Vice President Md Nurul Hasan told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>Police rescued Meherun and took her to Penn Presbyterian Medical Centre. She died on Wednesday after 37 hours on life support.</p>
      <p>Meherun’s brother, who was also in the car with her, suffered minor injuries in the accident.</p>
