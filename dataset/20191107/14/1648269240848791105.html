      <h1>Electric Ford Mustang GTE Fan Video Depicts A Shocking Future Pony</h1>
      <h2>It's unlike any Mustang EV rendering we've seen thus far.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:46:57+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/christopher-smith/" target="_blank">Christopher Smith</a></address>
      <p>We just saw <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a> unveil a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/380563/ford-mustang-lithium-manual-sema/">wicked 900-horsepower all-electric Mustang</a> at the 2019 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/sema-show/">SEMA Show</a>, and we’re on the cusp of seeing the company’s new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/378331/mustang-ev-crossover-teased-november-debut/">Mustang-inspired electric crossover</a> which breaks cover in a couple of weeks. As such, electrified Mustangs are certainly on the brain right now, and a supremely talented designer named Adan Lopez created a full-on future pony from scratch called the GTE.</p>
      <p>Not only is this car completely imagined inside and out in a series of renderings that Lopez graciously shared with us, there’s also a video at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4FKJB-wtuQ"><i>The Adan Channel</i> </a>on YouTube that circles in and around the car. The design clearly draws on the current generation, specifically with the headlights, sloping roof, and a front fascia that alludes to the Mustang’s present-day grille. The shallow hood reflects the lack of a thumping V8, and the top of the fascia forming a front spoiler is a rather interesting idea. The flared fender arches are certainly unexpected but it serves to create a very distinct design that fits well with the rest of the car. The only things missing are the Mustang’s iconic three-bar taillights at the rear.</p>

      <p>There’s a similar theme of familiar-yet-different inside. The steering wheel and instrument cluster are recognizable as a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mustang/">Mustang</a>, though nearly all vehicle functions are relegated to touch screens. We say<i> nearly</i> all because window switches are visible on the doors, headlight controls are left of the steering wheel, and a rotary dial is prominently positioned in the center console to select forward, reverse, neutral, or park. Don’t lament the lack of a manual, however – there’s an M button on that dial and if you look at the steering wheel, there are paddle shifters.</p>

      <p>Overall, we rather like this flight-of-fancy, and we’re not just saying that because we love seeing Mustang fans get all uppity over an electric-powered pony car. As some readers might be aware, your humble author has owned multiple Mustangs over the years, including <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/372106/ford-last-50-pushrod-v8-dyno/">a 1995 GT Convertible currently sitting in the garage</a>. Like it or not, the future is electric and it doesn’t have to be boring. This creation blends familiar Mustang cues with a satisfying combination of edges and curves, and it even offers driver involvement with paddle shifters.</p>
      <p>If this is Mustang’s future, at least one Mustang enthusiast is not afraid of the apocalypse.</p>
