      <h2>Kevin De Bruyne insists Manchester City can handle the red-hot atmosphere that awaits them at Anfield this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:00:19+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">David McDonnell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/david-mcdonnell/</a></address>
      <p>Kevin De Bruyne is relishing Sunday's title showdown with Liverpool and the white-hot atmosphere that will engulf Anfield.</p>
      <p>Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> can go nine points clear of nearest challengers <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> with victory and take a giant stride towards a first league title for 30 years.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne knows Liverpool's fans will make Anfield a hostile arena for Pep Guardiola's double champions, but the midfielder reckons he and his team-mates can feed off such a fervent atmosphere in a potentially season-defining clash.</p>
      <p>“I prefer to play in that than when there's nobody,” said De Bruyne. “Professionals want to play in front of 50, 60, 70 or 80,000 people and it makes it worthwhile.</p>

      <p>“You train all your life to get to the big stages. I want to compete for titles and to be the best, and to do that you have to win against the best.</p>
      <p>“But it’s a game like another. We know it’s a big game – Liverpool are ahead, we have to recover and be ready for Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it’s a big gap, but four weeks ago people were saying it was Liverpool’s to lose. I’m not keeping track of what people say, we play so many games.”</p>
      <p>De Bruyne admitted he would rather be in Liverpool's position than City's even though Guardiola's side overcame a seven-point deficit at the turn of the year to overhaul Klopp's men and make it back-to-back titles.</p>

      <p>“We want to be ahead, but we’ve lost points,” said De Bruyne. “People will talk about it whether we win, lose or draw, it’s for them to say what they want.</p>
      <p>“The big games are the ones you want to play, and if you want to compete for titles, you have to beat the best.</p>
      <p>“People have been talking about it for the whole week, even before the Champions League games, but we just do our job, keep calm and prepare ourselves.”</p>
