      <p>Just a few hours before the musician was expected to appear on stage as part of her ‘Enigma’ residency, Lady Gaga revealed on social media that she would have to cancel her performance at the Park Theater at Part MGM after being diagnosed with a sinus infection and bronchitis.</p>
      <p>Lady Gaga shared a picture of herself receiving treatment and wrote: “I’m so [devastated] I can’t perform tonight for so many people who traveled to come see me. I have a sinus infection and bronchitis and feel very sick and sad.</p>
      <p>“I never want to let you down,” she continued. “I’m just [too] weak and ill to perform tonight. I love you little monsters I’ll make it up to you. I promise.”</p>
