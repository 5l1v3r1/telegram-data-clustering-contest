      <p>Luxury British carmaker Aston Martin swung to a third-quarter loss on Thursday, saying its full-year wholesale volumes would be lower than previously guided after slumping demand in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/europe.html">Europe</a> and Asia.</p>
      <p>Volumes to dealers dropped 16 percent to 1,497 cars in the three months to the end of September as demand in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a> fell 22 percent. The wider Europe, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html">Middle East</a> and Africa area dropped 17 percent and in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/asia.html">Asia</a> volumes fell by a third.</p>
      <p>The 106-year-old firm, famed for being fictional agent James Bond's brand of choice, is taking action to cut costs and hopes the launch of its first sport-utility vehicle, the DBX, at a new factory in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/191021110800301.html">Wales</a>, will boost performance next year.</p>
      <p>"We're essentially holding the cost of a complete factory right now without the benefit of the revenues coming in ... so from that point of view, of course, it's a really important model," Chief Executive Officer Andy Palmer told Reuters.</p>
      <p>Aston, based in Gaydon near Birmingham, posted a 13.5 million-pound ($17.3m) loss in the three months to the end of September but said it still expects to meet market expectations of core earnings at approximately 203 million pounds ($261m).</p>
      <p>But Aston has suffered since its flotation last October where shares launched at 19 pounds ($24.50) before dropping for months and languishing at between four and five pounds ($5.13 - $6.41) for the last few weeks.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, however, shares recovered slightly, up nine percent to 4.5 pounds ($5.8) at (08:31 GMT).</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the company announced it was raising $150m in debt at a 12 percent interest rate to bolster its balance sheet ahead of the launch of the DBX.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Aston said its net interest expense guidance for 2019 now stood at about 83 million pounds ($106.4m), also affected by the effect of unhedged expenses in US dollars, with prior guidance at roughly 70 million pounds ($90m).</p>
      <p>Aston, which is primarily owned by Italian and Kuwaiti private equity groups, and not part of a wider automotive group, said it could thrive on its own alongside its work with German carmaker Daimler, which has a small stake in the firm.</p>
      <p>"Our relationship with Daimler is also important so we're not completely alone. We obviously have their technology to fall back on," said CEO Palmer.</p>
