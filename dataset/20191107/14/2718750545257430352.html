      <h1>Helen Mirren Says It’s ‘Very Flattering’ But, No, She Isn’t Keanu Reeves’s Girlfriend</h1>

      <p>Houston, we have a problem: Too many beautiful women are embracing their natural silver hair and the internet cannot keep them straight. Fans thought <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/helen-mirren-regal-on-red-carpet-for-catherine-the-great.html">Helen Mirren</a> was walking the LACMA Art+Film Gala red carpet hand in hand with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/keanu-reeves-responds-to-the-internets-love-for-him.html">Keanu Reeves</a>, but it was actually <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/keanu-reeves-out-with-rumored-girlfriend-alexandra-grant.html">his rumored girlfriend</a> (and business partner) Alexandra Grant. Mirren took it in stride, like the dame she is. “That was very flattering on me, you know, because she’s obviously lovely,” Mirren told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/helen-mirren-says-it-was-very-flattering-to-be-mistaken-for-keanu-reeves-girlfriend-exclusive"><i>Entertainment Tonight</i></a> on a red carpet for the premiere of her new film <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/good-liar-trailer-helen-mirren-and-ian-mckellen-face-off.html"><i>The Good Liar</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“I do know Keanu very well. He did a film with my husband and he is just the most adorable, lovely person,” Mirren said, referring to Taylor Hackford’s film<i> The Devil’s Advocate</i>. “So she’s a lucky girl and I’m sure that he’s a lucky boy.”</p>
      <p>The mix-up had to do with Alexandra Grant’s matching silver hair, red lipstick, and their passing resemblance. That’s about where the similarities end, though. Grant is a visual artist who has worked with Reeves on projects, including his <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/08/keanu-reeves-is-publishing-esoteric-books-not-erotic.html">adult picture book</a> <i>Ode to Happiness</i>. Helen Mirren … <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/helen-mirren-talks-winchester-and-her-wedding-night-haunting.html">is Helen Mirren</a>.</p>
