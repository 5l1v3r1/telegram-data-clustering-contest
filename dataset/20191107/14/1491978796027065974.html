        <i>• SRU ordered to apologise for criticism over threat to Japan game <br/>• Scottish Rugby to ‘reflect on outcome and consider our options’</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Scottish Rugby Union has been reprimanded and fined £70,000 for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/15/world-rugby-scotland-disciplinary-action">comments made by the chief executive, Mark Dodson, during the World Cup</a>.</p>
      <p>Tensions rose during the tournament in Japan when Scotland’s pivotal group game with the hosts was put under threat by Typhoon Hagibis. With Scotland needing to win to have a chance of progression, Dodson said he did not want his side to be “collateral damage” of the fallout of the typhoon.</p>
      <p>But in announcing the decision of an independent disputes committee, World Rugby said Dodson’s comments, “which suggested an unfair and disorganised treatment of all teams”, merited a reprimand, a written apology and a £70,000 fine. The game in question did go ahead, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/13/japan-scotland-rugby-world-cup-match-report">Scotland lost 28-21 to go out of the tournament</a>.</p>
      <p>Scottish Rugby has responded by stating “we will now reflect on this outcome and further consider our options, which may include arbitration”.</p>
      <p>In its statement, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-rugby">World Rugby</a> said it had invited the SRU to make an apology and a donation to the typhoon disaster relief fund but that the SRU had “suggested alternative wording which included a mutual expression of regret from both parties, and no apology.</p>
      <p>“The committee determined in respect of the first charge that comments attributed to Mark Dodson amounted to misconduct and brought the game into disrepute.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/12/scotland-world-cup-japan">Amid the uncertainty of whether or not the fixture would be played</a> at the Yokohama Stadium, Dodson had refused to rule out taking legal action in the event of a cancellation.</p>
      <p>“I think our view is that we have to reflect on that matter at that time. This is a glorious, world-class sporting occasion. We don’t want to be the people that taint that. But we also don’t want to be the collateral damage of this,” Dodson, who repeatedly asked for a “commonsense approach”, said at a snap press conference when asked if action could be taken.</p>
      <p>“And that’s why we took the legal route. It was just to say we’ve had a different opinion, two different opinions, one from the QC, that challenges that rigidity over scheduling.”</p>
      <p>World Rugby added the fine would be donated to the Childfund Pass it Back programme on World Rugby’s instruction, assisting with the relief effort in areas affected by Typhoon Hagibis.</p>
