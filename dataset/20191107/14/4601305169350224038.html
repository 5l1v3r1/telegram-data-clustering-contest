      <p>H.P. Lovecraft's only good short story is now a movie starring Nicolas Cage. Here's the trailer; it's out January 24, 2020. They've updated the setting to the present day and it's looks like they've gone all in for contemporary cosmic horror, a la <i>Annihilation</i>, over the original's disquieting radioactive miseries. Can't wait!</p>
