      <h1>PG&amp;E sees up to US$6.3 billion in costs from fires and bankruptcy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T14:47:00+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Chediak and Will Wade</a></address>
      <p>PG&amp;E Corp., the California utility that went bankrupt in January after its equipment sparked deadly wildfires, expects as much as US$6.3 billion in after-tax costs from the blazes, its Chapter 11 case and the recent blackouts.</p>
      <p>The troubled power giant reported a US$1.6-billion loss for the third quarter. It was driven by US$2.5 billion pre-tax charge for claims related to the 2017 Northern California wildfires and the 2018 Camp fire, the company said in a statement Thursday. PG&amp;E is not providing 2019 earnings guidance.</p>
      <p>The shares fell 1.8 per cent at 9:45 a.m. and are down 71 per cent on the year.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it’s a big write down but the key remains how the bankruptcy will get resolved,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kit Konolige said in an interview.</p>
      <p>The earnings are the first PG&amp;E has reported since its mass blackouts last month intended to keep power lines from sparking wildfires during windstorms, which drew outrage from state lawmakers and raised the specter of a government takeover. Despite the shutoffs, blazes continued to erupt. PG&amp;E’s equipment has been identified as a possible cause of at least three.</p>

      <p>The biggest of those blazes, the Kincade fire in Sonoma County, began Oct. 23 shortly after PG&amp;E equipment malfunctioned in the area. While the cause has yet to be determined, it’s “reasonably possible” the company will incur a loss related to the blaze, PG&amp;E said in a filing Thursday. “The utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage,” the PG&amp;E said.</p>
      <p>The prospect of more wildfire liabilities is critical for PG&amp;E. Since filing for Chapter 11 in January, the judge overseeing its case has warned another big blaze blamed on its equipment would upend the bankruptcy and potentially wipe out shareholders.</p>
      <p>During October, PG&amp;E enacted four massive blackouts to keep power lines from toppling in high winds and igniting more fires. Aside from fire liabilities and bankruptcy costs, the US$6.2 billion to US$6.3 billion in after-tax costs the company is expecting includes $65 million for customer credits related to shutoffs on Oct. 9, plus other items.</p>
      <p>The company’s earnings come days after California Governor Gavin Newsom met face to face with PG&amp;E Chief Executive Officer Bill Johnson and pressed him to quickly strike a deal with investors. Newsom has said the state won’t hesitate to take over the company if it doesn’t act soon.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E’s reorganization has drawn some of biggest names on Wall Street, including a group of bondholders led by billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management Corp. and Pacific Investment Management Co. The bondholders have aligned themselves with wildfire victims to pitch a restructuring plan that would all but wipe out existing PG&amp;E shareholders, including Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group LLC.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E stock has plunged 30 per cent since the start of October, when the company lost its exclusive right to pitch a reorganization plan and became the subject of attacks over its blackouts and wildfires.</p>
