      <p>LOS ANGELES - Giannis Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 16 rebounds, George Hill scored 24 off the bench and the Milwaukee Bucks repelled every threat in beating the Los Angeles Clippers 129-124 on Wednesday night for their fourth victory in a row.</p>
      <p>The Bucks hit 18 3-pointers, led by six from Hill.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo just missed a triple-double with nine assists.</p>
      <p>He's posted at least 10 rebounds and five assists in each of the first eight games of the season, the first player since at least 1972-73 to do so.</p>
      <p>The Clippers were without Kawhi Leonard, who rested for the first half of a home back-to-back. He'll play against Portland on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Montrezl Harrell had a career-high 34 points and 13 rebounds in his first start of the season.</p>
      <p>Lou Williams added 34 points and 11 assists, and Patrick Beverley had 20 points and 10 rebounds in the Clippers' first home loss.</p>
      <p>Led by Hill and Kyle Korver with 14 points, the Bucks reserves outscored the Clippers' bench 47-20, the first time that's happened to Los Angeles this season.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles starter Landry Shamet had just two points coming into the fourth, but he made four 3-pointers and finished with 14 points.</p>
      <p>The last one put the Clippers within two with 23 seconds left.</p>
      <p>The Bucks finished off the game at the free throw line, and the Clippers couldn't connect on their multiple chances during their last possession.</p>
      <p>The Clippers closed within four early in the fourth, but reigning NBA MVP Antetokounmpo reeled off seven straight points to keep the Bucks ahead 115-103.</p>
      <p>Former Clipper Eric Bledsoe added 20 points, and Brook Lopez had 11 points and 12 rebounds for the Bucks.</p>
      <p>The Clippers erased an 11-point deficit in the third.</p>
      <p>They forced three ties, but each time Antetokounmpo answered for the Bucks. He dunked, hit a 3-pointer and made two free throws.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee outscored the Clippers 15-6 to take a 98-89 lead into the fourth.</p>
      <p>The Bucks opened the second on a 30-11 run, hitting five 3-pointers, for their largest lead of 17 points. Hill scored 14 points to help the Bucks lead 70-59 at halftime.</p>
      <p>They closed with three consecutive 3s, two by Hill and the last by Korver, who beat the buzzer.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS<br/>   Bucks: Antetokounmpo had two airballs: the first on a jumper to end the first quarter and the second on a free throw in the third. ... For the first time in three games, the Bucks didn't lead all the way -- but they came close. The Clippers' only lead was by three points.<br/>   Clippers: Starting forward Patrick Patterson had just two points. ... Coach Doc Rivers remained stuck on 899 career wins.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT<br/>   Bucks: Visit the Utah Jazz on Friday, the third stop on their four-game trip.<br/>   Clippers: Host the Portland Trail Blazers on Thursday.</p>
