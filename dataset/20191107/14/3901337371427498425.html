      <p>On Wednesday, reports emerged that Wolves winger Adama Traore had finally made a decision on his international future, pledging his allegiance to Mali, his parents' homeland.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>maliactu.net</i>, Traore has elected to represent the African nation over his country of birth and could feature during the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers later this month.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old, who was previously courted by Mali back in 2014 but chose not to switch allegiance at that stage, represented Spain in age-group level football as recently as 2018.</p>
      <p>Traore was born Spain and graduated from the Barcelona's famous La Masia academy before moving on to Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and now Wolves, where he has caught the eye after a string of impressive performances.</p>
