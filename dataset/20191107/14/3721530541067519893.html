      <p>There’s a new shakeup at PlayStation as Shuhei Yoshida is stepping down as president of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Worldwide Studios. Replacing him is Hermen Hulst, managing director and co-founder of Guerrilla Games, the developer behind the Killzone series and <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i>.</p>
      <p>Yoshida will remain with Sony, however, as the head of “a newly formed initiative that will focus on nurturing external independent creators.”</p>
      <p>In a press release, president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment Jim Ryan called Hulst “one of the most effective and well respected leaders in the video game industry. He is a passionate advocate for the teams he leads and understands how to empower creative talent to build great experiences.”</p>
      <p>Added Ryan, “I have no doubt Hermen can lead our teams to deliver compelling and diverse experiences at a steady cadence.”</p>

      <p>Yoshida’s new role will “concentrate on our diverse community of independent developers, ensuring they have the tools, technology, and services to reach PlayStation’s large community of gamers successfully,” according to Sony.</p>
      <p>”Everybody knows just how passionate Shu is about independent games – they are lifeblood of the industry, making our content portfolio so special for our gamers,” Ryan said. “These wildly creative experiences deserve focus and a champion like Shu at PlayStation who will ensure the entire SIE organization works together to better engage with independent developers through a culture of supporting and celebrating their contributions to PlayStation platforms.”</p>
      <p>Yoshida and Hulst’s transitions come in the wake of several high-level executive moves at PlayStation in recent years. In 2017, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/3/16408882/playstation-sei-andrew-house-john-kodera">Andrew House left his role as president and chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>, and was replaced by John Kodera. In April, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/11/18221163/sony-playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-john-kodera-psn">Jim Ryan took over the role</a> of president and CEO of SIE from Kodera, and in September, then chairman of PlayStation’s Worldwide Studios <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/30/20892468/shawn-layden-sony-playstation-departs">Shawn Layden left the company</a> unceremoniously. Those leadership changes come as Sony prepares to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/8/20904343/sony-playstation-5-release-launch-date-holiday-2020">launch the PlayStation 5</a> during the 2020 holiday season.</p>
