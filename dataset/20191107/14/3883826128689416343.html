        <b>The 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry have all been formally identified, police said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Essex Police had been working with Vietnamese officials to identify the 31 men and eight women found dead in Grays, Essex, on 23 October.</p>
      <p>A series of files have been handed to Essex senior coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray.</p>
      <p>The force said it wanted to give families time to take in the news before making the names public.</p>
      <p>The victims came from Vietnamese provinces Haiphong, Hai Duong, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Hue, according to police in the country.</p>
      <h3>Extradition proceedings</h3>
      <p>Assistant Chief Constable for Essex Tim Smith said identification was "an important step" in the investigation.</p>
      <p>The bodies were found on the Waterglade Industrial Estate after the container had travelled to nearby Purfleet from Zeebrugge, in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court last week charged with a number of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-50221753">Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland</a>, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking.</p>
      <p>There have been 11 arrests in two provinces of Vietnam in relation to the deaths.</p>
