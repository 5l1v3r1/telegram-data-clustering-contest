      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/apple">Apple </a>has released the first developer beta of iOS 13.3 for all compatible iPhones, just a week after the launch of iOS 13.2.</p>
      <p>The latest builds can be obtained from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/apple">Apple </a>Developer Centre for participants in the Developer Beta programme, as well as via the usual over-the-air update for the devices already used for testing beta software.</p>
      <p>The new update introduces Communication Limits for Screen Time, a feature that iPhone maker promised was coming to iOS 13 in a future update, MacRumors reported on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>With this new feature, parents can control who their children are able to contact. It applies to the Phone, FaceTime, and Messages apps, along with iCloud contacts.</p>
      <p>The beta appears to fix the iOS 13.2 issue that was causing apps to refresh more frequently than normal. Additionally, there's a new option to prevent Animoji and Memoji stickers from being displayed on the Emoji keyboard.</p>
