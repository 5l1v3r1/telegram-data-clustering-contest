        <b>[Be sure to watch Serena Altschul's report on "Joy of Cooking" on "Sunday Morning" November 10!]</b>

      <p>Of their Mushroom Confit they write:</p>
      <p>"We first encountered mushroom confit in a Thomas Keller cookbook, and we've been tweaking the recipe for years. In our opinion, this is the perfect way to preserve wild mushrooms from a successful foraging venture. Serve as part of an antipasto spread or cheese board, or toss with pasta, serve over polenta, or pile on thickly sliced toasted bread."</p>
      <h3>Mushroom Confit</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Makes about 6 cups</i>
      </p>
      <p>Toss together in a colander placed in the sink or over a bowl:<br/><b>2 pounds mushrooms, larger ones quartered, any tough stems removed<br/>1 tablespoon salt</b></p>
      <p>Let sit for 1 hour. Gently press any excess moisture out of them (do not rinse). Set aside.</p>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 200°F.</p>
      <p>Combine in a large ovenproof saucepan or Dutch oven:<br/><b>2 cups olive oil<br/>2 shallots, thinly sliced<br/>4 garlic cloves, smashed<br/>4 sprigs thyme<br/>1 small sprig rosemary<br/>1 bay leaf<br/>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</b></p>
      <p>Set the heat to medium and wait for the garlic to start faintly bubbling. Reduce the heat to maintain a low simmer and cook for 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mixture steep for at least 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Add the mushrooms, cover, transfer to the oven, and bake for 1 hour. Remove from the oven, uncover, and stir in:<br/><b>1/4 cup sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar<br/>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</b></p>
      <p>Cool completely before packing into a jar with a tight-fitting lid, making sure the mushrooms are completely submerged in the oil. Store refrigerated for up to 1 month.</p>
