      <p>Mum has admitted sending her six 'stinky' kids to school - because skipping a bath 'won't kill them'.</p>
      <p>Single parent Constance Hall, an Australian blogger, reveals the shortcuts she takes to save time.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-six admitted her children don't wash every day.</p>
      <p>She said: "They don’t have to bath or shower every day."</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/constance-hall-kids-names/">Mama Mia</a> , she added: "They can quite often skip that part of the routine if it’s getting everyone down. I’m like, “Fine, stinky, go to school and gross everyone out”.</p>
      <p>"I personally can’t be f***ed bathing everyone every night."</p>

      <p>Justifying her decision to let her kids skip a daily wash she claims the  <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2015/02/26/why-you-should-stop-giving-your-kid-a-bath-every-night/">American Academy of Dermatology</a>  said that youngsters aged between six and 11 only need to bath once or twice a week unless they are dirty, sweaty or have a skin condition.</p>
      <p>"I know it makes them look more loveable when they are all clean and smell fresh, but really, skipping a night bath or morning shower a couple of times a week won’t kill them, " she added, reports the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mum-sends-six-stinky-kids-20832312">Mirror.</a></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Talking about meal times at their home, she said: "Feast with your hands.</p>

      <p>"Dishes are the worst part of dinner. In other cultures everyone eats with their hands off the same plate."</p>
      <p>She added: "Eating should be one of the pleasurable things you share with your kids, not a blur of angry memories.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"So if they don’t eat their dinner, don't stress, try something else, keep trying or just let the turd eat his plain pasta and tomato sauce.</p>
      <p>"None of my kids ate anything healthy under seven, they all eat well over seven and they are perfectly healthy."</p>

      <p>Other parenting advice she dishes out includes having picnics, using coloured-coded buckets to "chuck" each child's clothes in, having a "check-out" time where you can relax and  blocking out her kid's noises by donning headphones.</p>
      <p>She said: "I can’t respond to the 400 questions a day by six different kids: the fights over whose turn on the iPad it is, or who ruined what. I just can’t. So I block it out."</p>
