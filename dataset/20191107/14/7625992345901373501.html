      <p>"Almost everyone has their own take on this classic American confection," write Becker and Scott. "This is the classic, lighter brownie that has appeared in 'Joy' since 1931."</p>
      <h3>Brownies Cockaigne</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Makes 16 to 24 two-inch squares</i>
      </p>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. If you want chewy and moist brownies, use a 13 × 9 × 2-inch pan; if cakey, a 9-inch square pan. Grease the pan and line with parchment paper so it extends over the long sides.</p>
      <p>Melt in a small saucepan:<br/><b>1 stick (4 oz or 115g) unsalted butter<br/>4 ounces (115g) unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped</b></p>
      <p>Let cool. If you don't, your brownies will be heavy and dry. Beat in a large bowl until light in color and foamy in texture:<br/><b>4 large eggs<br/>1/4 teaspoon salt</b></p>
      <p>Gradually add and continue beating until thick:<br/><b>2 cups (400g) sugar<br/>1 teaspoon vanilla</b></p>
      <p>With a few swift strokes, stir in the cooled chocolate mixture just until combined. Even if you are using an electric mixer, switch to a wooden spoon for this. Stir in just until combined:<br/><b>1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour</b></p>
      <p>If desired, gently stir in:<br/><b>1 cup chopped toasted pecans</b></p>
      <p>Scrape the batter into the prepared pan. Bake about 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or with moist crumbs attached. Let cool completely in the pan on a rack. If desired, serve with:<br/><b>Whipped cream or ice cream</b></p>
      <h3>       <br/>Fudgy Brownies</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Makes 16 two-inch squares</i>
      </p>
      <p>They write: "Darker, richer, and fudgier than Brownies Cockaigne, this is our idea of the perfect, modern brownie."</p>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9-inch square baking pan and line with parchment paper so it extends over 2 sides. Melt, stirring frequently, in a large saucepan over low heat:<br/><b>1 stick (4 oz or 115g) unsalted butter, cut into cubes<br/>1 cup (170g) semisweet chocolate chips</b></p>
      <p>Whisk in until the sugar is dissolved:<br/><b>1/2 cup (100g) sugar<br/>1/2 cup packed (115g) brown sugar</b></p>
      <p>Whisk in until just combined:<br/><b>2 large eggs<br/>2 teaspoons espresso powder<br/>1 teaspoon vanilla</b></p>
      <p>Stir in just until combined:<br/><b>3/4 cup (95g) all-purpose flour<br/>1/3 cup (25g) unsweetened cocoa powder<br/>1/4 teaspoon salt</b></p>
      <p>Scrape into the prepared pan. If desired, sprinkle over the top:<br/><b>1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt</b></p>
      <p>Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely in the pan on a rack before cutting.</p>
