      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/china">China</a> said it struck a tentative deal with the U.S. to start rolling back tariffs in phases, a potential sign of easing tensions amid a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/china-announces-tariffs-75-billion-us-goods-trump/story?id=65147062">trade war</a> that has cast global uncertainty on the economy for months.</p>
      <p>China's Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said negotiators between Beijing and Washington have agreed to a "phased cancellation" of tariff hikes if talks continue to progress, the Associated Press reported.</p>
      <p>“If the two sides achieve a ‘Phase 1’ agreement, then based on the content of that agreement, tariffs already increased should be canceled at the same time and by the same rate,” Gao said.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, a Trump administration official confirmed the accuracy of reports of an agreement to roll back tariffs as part of phase one agreement.</p>
      <p>The U.S. and China have leveled billions of dollars of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/china-announces-tariffs-75-billion-us-goods-trump/story?id=65147062">retaliatory tariffs</a> on exports from each other for months, sowing uncertainty for many U.S. businesses.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/fitbit-move-production-china-ongoing-threat-tariffs/story?id=66182090">FitBit announced</a> it would move manufacturing operations out of China to avoid tariffs, joining a growing list of U.S. companies that are doing the same.</p>

      <p>Reports that a global trade war could be waning sent stocks soaring Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 jumped to a record-high by midday Thursday and the Dow jumped more than 200 points.  </p>
      <p>The stocks spike caught the attention of President Donald Trump, who tweeted "Enjoy!"</p>
