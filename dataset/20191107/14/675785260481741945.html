      <p>Jeremy Clarkson says he's currently stranded on a tropical island with his Grand Tour co-stars.</p>
      <p>The former Top Gear presenter, 59, kept his fans updated on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> as he revealed that he, James May and Richard Hammond had ended up on the wrong island - 500 miles away from their film crew.</p>
      <p>They had flown on a cargo plane with all their equipment but it broke, leaving them "marooned".</p>
      <p>Clarkson tweeted: "Only May, Hammond and I could do this: end up 500 miles away from the entire crew, on the wrong island.</p>
      <p>"We elected to fly on the cargo plane with the kit and it broke.</p>

      <p>"Now we're marooned on a tropical island with nothing but a car and wine."</p>
      <p>He also posted a picture of May looking fed up and surrounded by beers.</p>
      <p>Clarkson added: "May is going through the rations too fast. We may not survive."</p>

      <p>He then posted a video of his co-hosts sitting around drinking as they made a joke intro to a new episode.</p>
      <p>Hammond said: "Hello and welcome to a Grand Tour special."</p>
      <p>"Which is coming to you from Jeremy Clarkson's iPhone," May added.</p>
      <p>Clarkson said off-camera: "Yes I'm really sorry the battery's gone, battery's gone!"</p>

      <p>But fans weren't convinced they were in a life or death situation, as many noticed that there was a food truck behind them.</p>
      <p>One said: "Some tropical island, has its own taco truck."</p>
      <p>"The catering truck behind is a bit if a giveaway," another posted.</p>
