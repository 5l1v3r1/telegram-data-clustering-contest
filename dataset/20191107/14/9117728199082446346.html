        <b>It has been a year of transition for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> this season as they adapt to life with a Honda engine. Christian Horner has insisted that the team have made progress in 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Red Bull have had mixed fortunes this season with the form and consistency of <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> a high point but the doubt surrounding his long term teammate has been a cause for concern. With <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> and Verstappen winning two races each last season, their two wins this season suggests they've gone backwards.</p>
      <p>However, with expectations different this season given the transition to a Honda power unit, Horner is very satisfied with this season's form.</p>
      <p><i>"This year was always going to be a transnational year with a new engine partner,"</i>Â he told <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/horner-red-bull-momentum-2020/4593906/">Motorsport</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I have to say all compliments to Honda with all the progress they have made this year with performance.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"I think we have made good progress throughout the year, we have had a couple of wins, we have achieved a couple of poles although only started on pole once, and we have been a contender to win a few races this year.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"In Monaco, we were very competitive, Hungary as well, we were in a position potentially to win that race, and here again we have been that competitive.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"So we are on the right trajectory. It is important that we carry the momentum into the winter and then into the beginning of next year."</i>
