        <i>Urging visitors to unrushed appreciation, the exhibition displays just one work – The Virgin of the Rocks</i>
      </p>
      <p>An experimental exhibition will this weekend open at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/national-gallery">the National Gallery</a> in London with a simple aim – to encourage people to spend minutes rather than seconds looking at a masterpiece.</p>
      <p>“This whole exhibition is about getting slower looking,” said Caroline Campbell, the gallery’s director of collections and research, ahead of a show which, boldly, has just one work of art: <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/leonardo-da-vinci-the-virgin-of-the-rocks">Leonardo da Vinci’s The Virgin of the Rocks</a>.</p>
      <p>She added: “We want to get people to spend more time looking at a really great work of art because we feel that people sometimes spend 15 seconds looking at a painting in the gallery.”</p>
      <p>Campbell said the gallery had purposefully set out to do something no other gallery had done with the immersive exhibition. “The purpose of this project … is that you understand and enjoy and appreciate one of the National Gallery’s great masterpieces even better.”</p>

      <p>The show has been created by <a href="https://twitter.com/59productions?lang=en">59 Productions</a>, the company behind the video design used for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.</p>
      <p>Visitors to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/national-gallery">National Gallery</a>, using timed entry, will walk through multi-sensory rooms which explore various aspects of the Leonardo painting. One room invites visitors to play around with light, illuminating various angles of an object, a subject endlessly explored by Leonardo. Another room attempts to bring to life the modern conservation studio.</p>
      <p>The final room hosts the painting, which has been set in a model of the altarpiece that housed it, in 1508, in the chapel of the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception in the church of San Francesco Grande, Milan, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a>. That room has a seven minute audio-visual loop.</p>
      <p>Richard Slaney, managing director of 59 Productions, said visitors so far had been staying the course. “People have become mesmerised by the painting,” he said. “The idea of a show like this, with only one painting, is a big experiment but it’s nice to be able to part of that and see what people make of it.”</p>
      <p>The show is the National Gallery’s contribution to celebrations marking the 500th anniversary of Leonardo’s death.</p>
      <p>The main event is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/21/mona-lisa-leonard-da-vinci-louvre-exhibition">the huge Leonardo show</a> at <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/expositions/leonardo-da-vinci">the Louvre, in Paris</a>, running until 24 February next year, to which the National has lent its other Leonardo, <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/leonardo-da-vinci-the-burlington-house-cartoon">the </a><a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/leonardo-da-vinci-the-burlington-house-cartoon">Burlington House Cartoon</a>. The Louvre, which has in its collection an earlier version of <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/virgin-rocks">The Virgin of the Rocks</a>, had not asked to display the London painting because they knew it could not travel, said Campbell.</p>
      <p>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/leonardo-experience-a-masterpiece">Leonardo: Experience a Masterpiece is at the National Gallery from 9 November to 12 January. Standard weekday admission £18.</a></p>
