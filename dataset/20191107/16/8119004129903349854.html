        <b>The housemaid accused of killing a businessman’s mother-in-law and a house help at their home in Dhaka’s Dhanmondi has made a confessional statement in court, police say.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Surobhi Akter Nahida gave the statement before Dhaka Metropolitan Magistrate Srafut Zaman Ansari on Thursday, Court Police’s Sub-Inspector Ashraf Ali told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>The statement given under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can be used as evidence in trial.</p>
      <p>Surobhi described how and why she carried out the killings, the policeman said.</p>
      <p>The bodies of Afroza Begum, 65, and her house help “Diti”, 18, were found with throats slit at their home on Nov 1.</p>
      <p>Police said they were looking for a new housemaid who entered the house in the afternoon and left in the evening.</p>

      <p>Police believed such murders are the work of a professional killer and Surobhi actually posed as a housemaid to carry out the killings.</p>
      <p>A blood-stained shoe of Surobhi was found near the house later, police said.</p>
      <p>The law enforcers arrested her at a slum in the capital’s Agargaon on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Police suspected she was “mentally imbalanced” as she told them she “killed the two because they had refused to let her go out”.</p>
      <p>Police on Tuesday took Surobhi and four other suspects into custody for a five-day grilling.</p>
      <p>The others accused in the case started by victim Afroza’s son-in-law Kazi Monir Uddin Tarim, an apparel sector entrepreneur, are security guard Md Nuruzaaman, and caretakers Gausul Azam Prince, Atikul Haque Bachchu and Belayet Hossain.</p>
