      <p>Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a massive success by all accounts, as every single release was a critical and box office success. The final few rounds were especially important, as <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame</i> changed the shared universe forever. In between those movies was <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>, which revealed where Scott Lang was before during Thanos' assault. And it turns out that <i>Endgame</i> almost had a hilarious reference to Peyton Reed's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467140/new-avengers-endgame-theory-brings-hank-pym-into-the-story">second installment</a> in the MCU.</p>
      <p><i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i> was a breathe of fresh air and levity, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478968/ant-man-and-the-wasps-ghost-teases-her-return-to-the-mcu">following the grim ending</a> of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>. We followed Paul Rudd's Scott Lang as he served the end of his house arrest, due to his involvement in <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>'s tarmac battle. One of the first scenes has Scott going through his day at home, to the tune of The Partridge Family's theme song "Come on Get Happy!" And that track was originally going to pop back up in <i>Endgame</i>. As editor Jeff Ford jut revealed:</p>
      <blockquote>There was also an additional joke where Rudd and Evangeline were in the van, and they’re trying to hot-wire it, and he twists a couple of wires, and the radio comes on and it plays that Partridge Family song from <i>Ant-Man and the Wasp</i> that he was into. The Outriders go [imitates their heads popping up]. I always thought it was funny that the Outriders heard the Partridge Family, and they start coming at the van and he’s like 'Aww, I’m sorry!'</blockquote>
      <p>Well, my FOMO is through the roof. <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> went through plenty of versions, especially where its final battle is concerned. Some bits were left on the cutting room floor, including this quick nod to <i>Ant-Man and The Wasp</i>.</p>

      <p>Jeff Ford's comments to <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/avengers-endgame-final-battle-oral-history/">Slash Film</a> highlight how collaborative and ever-changing the creation of <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> was. The Russo Brothers shot their pair of Avengers flicks back to back, so the production was a frenzied one. As such, much of the crafting of those blockbusters came during the editing process-- which Jeff Ford was intimately involved with.</p>

      <p>It should be interesting to see how <i>Ant-Man 3</i> adapts the events of the hero's journey on the comics. In the meantime, you can get your hands on Ant-Man's adventures <a href="https://comixology.sjv.io/5PVON">on the page here</a>.</p>
      <p>The Russo Brothers were balancing a massive cast, and two long and complicated movies. As such, there's a ton of footage that never made into the theatrical cut. The <i>Ant-Man</i> franchise became much more integral to the greater MCU in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, with Scott coming up <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478407/avengers-endgames-time-stone-heist-almost-looked-very-different">with the Time Heist</a>, and the surviving Avengers used Pym tech to travel through the MCU's timeline.</p>
      <p>It's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483736/michael-douglas-confirms-ant-man-3-role-when-filming-will-begin">currently unclear</a> when A<i>nt-Man 3</i> will hit theaters, but it is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477069/the-marvel-movies-well-probably-see-in-marvels-phase-5">expected in Phase Five</a>. The <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482818/scarlett-johansson-says-black-widow-gave-her-closure-after-avengers-endgame">next installment</a> in the MCU is <i>Black Widow</i> on May 1st, 2020.
