      <h2>Luke McCowan's early season form has seen him win rave reviews and big clubs are now lining up.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T16:42:04+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/stuart-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Ayr United starlet Luke McCowan is being linked with a move to English Championship side Cardiff City.</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds are understood to be monitoring the striker, following a string of stunning displays.</p>
      <p>McCowan, who has hit eight goals for Ayr this season, is attracting the eye of a number of big club scouts down south.</p>
      <p>And Cardiff are thought to be at the head of the queue, with boss Neil Warnock considering a January bid.</p>

      <p>Tom Coleman, sports reporter at WalesOnline, told the Ayrshire Post: "The move would make a lot of sense from Cardiff's end.</p>
      <p>"They don't have a lot of money to spend these days and McCowan would fit the profile of a young player with a lot of potential.</p>
      <p>"He's a name that's being linked and it will be of interest with January coming up.</p>
      <p>"He would certainly tick a lot of boxes for Warnock.</p>
      <p>The speculation comes a year on from fellow Welsh giants Swansea City, circling around Lawrence Shankland during his time at Ayr.</p>
      <p>But chairman Lachlan Cameron told the Dragons he was not prepared to sell his star striker - even for a bid of Â£250,000.</p>
