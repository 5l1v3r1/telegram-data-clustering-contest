      <p>THE Minister for Rural and Community Development, Michael Ring, has confirmed that he has approved €146,287 in Leader support for Carnacon Community Development Association CLG to support the redevelopment of the walled garden at Moorehall Estate.</p>
      <p>The estate comprises 40 acres of woodland and a two acre walled garden overlooking Lough Carra.</p>
      <p>Minister Ring said: “This is a really significant development in the regeneration of Moorehall and follows on from the recent purchase of the estate by Mayo County Council with assistance from the government.</p>
      <p>“The magnificent two acre walled garden has fallen into disrepair and this investment will help bring it back to its former glory.</p>
      <p>"The funding will be used to carry out the necessary site clearance, repairs to the walls and the restoration of dovecote.</p>
      <p>"This garden is of significant historical and heritage interest and has the potential with further development to contribute to local biodiversity and tourism generation.</p>
      <p>“This is the culmination of a significant community effort to see the walled garden in Moorehall estate restored.</p>
      <p>"In recent years the walls have been damaged further with the falling of trees in recent storms.</p>
      <p>"Once the structure of the walled garden has been redeveloped, I am told that the next step will be to bring the garden back to life."</p>
      <p>Minister Ring concluded: “Leader funding provides invaluable support to a wide variety of community and enterprise initiatives in Mayo. I have now announced over €6 million in funding for more than 150 Leader funded projects in the county.”</p>
