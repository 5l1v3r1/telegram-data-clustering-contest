      <p>MANILA: Philippine authorities rescued dozens of people on Thursday (Nov 7) after a ferry sank in rough seas, but search teams were still working to confirm all aboard were accounted for, the coast guard said.</p>
      <p>Rescuers plucked 59 people from waters off the central island of Cebu, while another three swam to shore after the vessel took on water and capsized.</p>

      <p>The manifest showed 60 crew and passengers aboard, the coast guard said, however it is not clear if the list was complete.</p>

      <p>Manifests in the Philippines are often not a full accounting because passengers may stow away or captains can exceed the official capacity of their vessel.</p>
      <p>"Rescue operations are ongoing. We cannot stop until we are satisfied that everyone is safe and has been accounted for," coast guard spokesman Lieutenant Michael Encina told AFP.</p>
      <p>"The boat has sunk. We haven't been able to find it," he added.</p>
      <p>The vessel, Siargao Princess, was plying a route near Cebu when its crew radioed for help, saying the boat was in trouble.</p>

      <p>The Philippines, an archipelago where millions rely on rickety ferries for cheap transport between islands, has regular boat accidents.</p>
