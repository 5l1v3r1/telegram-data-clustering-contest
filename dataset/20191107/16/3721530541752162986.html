      <p>Leigh Whannell, known for writing the first three Saw movies as well as the Insidious<i> </i>movies, has a new scare for us in the form of <i>The Invisible Man. </i>The man himself may be invisible, but there’s a new trailer for us all to watch that’s dropped today.</p>
      <p>An adaptation of the H. G. Wells novel of the same name and a reboot of the 1933 movie based on it, <i>The Invisible Man</i> marks the second entry in Universal’s Dark Universe. Originally meant to star Johnny Depp, the movie was rejiggered following the flop of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/7/15753440/the-mummy-review"><i>The Mummy</i></a>, and turned into more of a stand-alone entry than a continuation of the franchise.</p>
      <p>The film stars Elisabeth Moss as Cecilia Kass, whose abusive boyfriend Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) seemingly commits suicide. As she begins to pick up the pieces of her life, it becomes clear that something if wrong. Cecilia becomes convinced that Adrian discovered a way to make himself invisible and is continuing to abuse her, but she’s met with disbelief from everyone around her.</p>
      <p>Griffin has always been a villain, but this new take on the material makes that particularly evident by putting Cecilia at its center and turning invisibility into a way of interrogating when we do or don’t believe women’s stories about their abuse.</p>
      <p>The film is set to hit theaters on Feb. 28, 2020.</p>
