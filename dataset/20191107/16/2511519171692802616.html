      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Brendan%20Rodgers">Brendan Rodgers</a> has no doubt former <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> defender <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kieran-tierney">Kieran Tierney</a> will find his feet and make an impact at <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>.</p>
      <p>On Saturday at the King Power Stadium, Rodgers and Tierney will be on opposing sides for the first time since the ex-Bhoys manager departed Celtic Park for Leicester last February and with the player now at Arsenal following a £25million move in August.</p>
      <p>Rodgers has nothing but praise for Tierney as he said: “As a player, in the first week working with him, I could see after two or three days why there was a lot of clamour for him.</p>
      <p>“From that moment he was absolutely brilliant for me. He became stronger, more powerful, very aggressive in his game.</p>
      <p>“He worked hard every single day but he was also a strong boy mentally, and he had a lot of good mentors. Scott Brown was an incredible captain for me, and he (Tierney) took on that mantle to try and be like him.</p>
      <p>“Every day in training he was very focused on becoming better, and obviously he loved Celtic as a club. He supported the club, and that gave him that extra one per cent every time he played.</p>
      <p>“So as a player he was fantastic, and he captained the team for me on a few occasions as well, but also a great boy, very humble, just wanting to be the very best he can be.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal’s move for Tierney was three years in the making as they approached Celtic for the now 22-year-old in Rodgers’ first week in charge of the club in May 2016.</p>

      <p>“Peter (Lawwell, chief executive) had said to me – and he was very honest about it – there was a possibility of Kieran going to Arsenal, but there was no rush for Celtic to sell him, and there was a big offer at the time,” added Rodgers.</p>
      <p>“So I spoke to Kieran, told him I wanted him to stay, to be a big part of what we were doing, and between him and the club, a new deal was agreed, and he stayed until he went in the summer.</p>
      <p>“He’s gone into Arsenal, a really competitive team and a huge club, and it takes that little bit of time to settle.</p>
      <p>“He’s gone from one big city to another, leaving behind his family and friends in Glasgow, so it’s been a period of adaptation for him.</p>

      <p>Rodgers, meanwhile, has hailed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/james-maddison">James Maddison</a> as “a big talent”, with the midfielder again called into the England squad for the Euro 2020 qualifiers against Montenegro and Kosovo.</p>
      <p>It is the fourth time Maddison has been called up, although on the last occasion he blotted his copybook as he was spotted in a casino shortly after withdrawing, citing illness.</p>

      <p>Rodgers said: “He is a fantastic player and a wonderful talent who is improving and getting better all the time.</p>
      <p>“He is working very hard, for Leicester first and foremost, and then ultimately to take a place in the England squad.</p>
      <p>“He will do his very best for Leicester, and then when he does well, he reports (for England) and he can do no more.”</p>
