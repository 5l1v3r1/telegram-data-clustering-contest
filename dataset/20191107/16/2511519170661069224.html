      <h2>Research suggests function may be taken over by another region of brain</h2>

      <p>Researchers have discovered a medical abnormality that changes how we understand the link between the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brain">brain</a> and the ability to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/smell">smell</a>.  </p>
      <p>According to a new study, published in the journal <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cell.com%2Fneuron%2Ffulltext%2FS0896-6273%2819%2930854-2&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/smell-brain-missing-scent-left-hand-women-olfactory-bulbs-research-a9193736.html">Neuron</a>, there is a group of people who possess the ability to smell, despite lacking the region of the brain that processes this information.</p>
      <p>The discovery, which suggests the human brain may have a greater ability to adapt, happened by chance after researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel found that a 29-year-old woman who was missing “olfactory bulbs”, the region in the front of the brain that processes information about smells from the nose, could smell better than the average person. </p>
      <p>After identifying the anomaly, the researchers recruited more people, who were also <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/left-handed">left-handed</a> and female, to see if the ability was unique to the woman. </p>
      <p>“Lo and behold, we discovered another woman without olfactory bulbs and a perfect <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/sense-of-smell">sense of smell</a>,” senior author Noam Sobel, a professor of neurobiology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, told <a href="https://www.livescience.com/patients-missing-olfactory-bulbs-can-still-smell.html">Live Science</a>. “It started to look like no coincidence.” </p>
      <p>The finding prompted the researchers to search through a database called the Human Connectome Project, which has more than 1,100 published MRI scans, as well as information about the participants’ smell.</p>
      <p>The researchers found that of the 606 women analysed, three didn’t have olfactory bulbs but still had the ability to smell. One of the women was left-handed. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon was not detected in men, however, and researchers are unsure why gender or left-handedness are factors. </p>
      <p>Further research through the use of olfactory perceptual fingerprints showed that the sense of smell in the two women without olfactory bulbs was comparable to 140 similarly aged women. </p>
      <p>Interestingly, while the women could rate how similar smells such as orange and lemon are, they were unable to detect rose-like odours.</p>

      <p>Overall, the research shows that it is possible for some women who are left-handed and born without olfactory bulbs, previously considered “utterly essential to the sensory system”, to smell.</p>
      <p>As for why this may be the case, the scientists only have hypotheses as of now. </p>
      <p>According to Professor Sobel, the first reason may be that these women were born without olfactory bulbs and then found a way “to make smell work” during infancy as their brains developed - which would attest to “how plastic the brain is”.</p>
      <p>A second hypothesis is that we “don’t actually need olfactory bulbs to detect, discriminate and identify smells,” which would mean the olfactory bulb has a different function - possibly locating a smell rather than actually identifying it. </p>
      <p>While more research is required to reach a conclusion, Professor Sobel told the <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Fhealth-50315440&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/smell-brain-missing-scent-left-hand-women-olfactory-bulbs-research-a9193736.html"><i>BBC</i></a> the latter hypothesis is a “dramatic alternative” to what we previously thought we understood about smell.</p>
