      <p>The number of vaping-related lung injuries is up to 2,051, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2019/s1107-lung-injury-cases.html">in a statement</a> today. Health officials are now referring to the mystery illness as EVALI, short for e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury. Cases of EVALI have been reported in 49 states (all but Alaska) and the District of Columbia, and a total of 39 deaths have been confirmed.</p>
      <p>In September, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/06/cdc-e-cig-vaping-warning/">CDC warned people</a> against using e-cig or vaping products until it figured out what was causing EVALI, and the FDA has opened <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/19/fda-vaping-criminal-investigation/">an investigation</a> into the illness. It's still unclear what's causing EVALI and what role, if any, flavored or THC vape products play.</p>
      <p>In response to the vaping health crisis, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/massachusetts-temporarily-bans-all-vaping-products/">Massachusetts temporarily banned</a> all vaping products. <a href="https://apnews.com/48359af03a034eacbb315971db005e58">New York</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/04/michigan-bans-flavored-e-cigarettes/">Michigan</a> have banned flavored products. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/19/san-francisco-e-cigarette-ban-vote-vaping-juul/">San Francisco</a> banned the sale of vaping products earlier this summer. The Trump administration has toyed with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/11/the-trump-administration-plans-to-ban-flavored-e-cigs-to-curb-te/">banning the sale of flavored e-cigs</a>, though the concern there is over the increase in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/09/fda-juul-letter-details-violations/">teen vaping</a>. According to CNBC, two top health officials will testify before Congress next week.</p>
      <p>Anyone who uses e-cig products should watch for symptoms, like cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, abdominal pain or fever. And in case you needed a reminder, the CDC says you "should not buy these products off the street."</p>
