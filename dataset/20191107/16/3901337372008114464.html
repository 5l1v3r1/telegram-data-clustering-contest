      <p>"I am the coach," Emery said, as reported by the <i>Daily Mail.</i></p>
      <p>The Spaniard also shared his disappointment at Arsenal's failure to claim all three points against their Portuguese opponents, but maintained his side's ambition to remain competitive in the tournament.</p>

      <p>"In this competition, our objective is to be first in the group," the former Paris Saint-Germain boss added. Â </p>
      <p>"We are going to play the next two matches to make sure we're in that position. Now we're going to prepare for a new competition.</p>
      <p>"We worked, we played, fighting against a team with strong organisation. When we did the most difficult, score one goal, they drew at the end.</p>
      <p>"It's a little disappointing for that result. We're first in the group, we want to make sure of that position in the next matches."</p>
