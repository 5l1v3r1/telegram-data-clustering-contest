      <h1>Player set for shock January exit after failed Aston Villa transfer</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news | AVFC came close to signing the defender last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T16:24:12+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Harold Mokoudi came so close to becoming an Aston Villa player last year.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old defender was on Steve Bruce’s radar in the summer of 2018 and was jetted into Birmingham to check out the club’s facilities ahead of a £7million transfer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/its-totally-wrong-aston-villa-15803242">Moukoudi decided against a move to England</a> at that time, though, and stayed at French club Le Havre.</p>
      <p>He started the season in Ligue 2 extraordinarily well with a series of solid displays at the heart of defence.</p>

      <p>But Moukoudi refused to sign a new contract with Le Havre and having been released, he joined Saint-Etienne in July.</p>
      <p>He’s made nine appearances for the Ligue 1 side this season but is set to be at the centre of yet another transfer episode in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Former Leicester City boss Claude Puel took over at Saint-Etienne last month and doesn’t see Moukoudi as part of his plans going forward.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> are highly unlikely to renew their interest with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> having signed four centre-backs on permanent deals in the summer.</p>
      <p>Bjorn Engels and Ezri Konsa were brought in after Tyrone Mings and Kortney Hause had their loan stints converted into full-time deals.</p>
