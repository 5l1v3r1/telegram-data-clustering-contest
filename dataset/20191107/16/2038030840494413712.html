      <p>Cape Town – South African musician Jesse Clegg's latest single, <i>Let It Burn</i>, is all over local charts and it's one of many songs the 31-year-old recorded in The States.</p>
      <p>While in Los Angeles, where he spent three weeks writing and recording the new music Jesse collaborated with Black Coffee.</p>
      <p>About working with the DJ, Jesse said: "It was an awesome experience and inspiring to work with some great artists. LA has amazing studio facilities and a wealth of great producers".</p>
      <p>On the collaboration with Black Coffee, Jesse adds: "The session came about organically, we happened to be in LA at the same time. I'm really excited about the song we wrote, it has a lot of potential. It so happened that Kelly Rowland was sitting in on the same studio session also working on new material, so it was fantastic to be in the creative process with artists of that calibre."</p>
