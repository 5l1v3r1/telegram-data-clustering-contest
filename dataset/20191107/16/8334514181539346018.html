      <p>DUBAI (Reuters) - The U.S.-led naval coalition in the Gulf, established in response to a series of attacks on oil tankers, opened a command center in Bahrain on Thursday, the U.S. Fifth Fleet said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The attacks heightened the risk of disruption to Gulf oil exports shipped through the Strait of Hormuz. The United States blamed the attacks on Iran. Tehran denied the accusations.</p>
      <p>The coalition is known as the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC). Bahrain is also home to the Fifth Fleet.</p>
