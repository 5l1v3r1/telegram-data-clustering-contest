      <p>If you missed the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/steamworld_quest_gets_physical_on_switch_pre-orders_go_live_next_week">news</a> last week, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_quest_hand_of_gilgamech"><b>SteamWorld Quest</b></a> is going on sale in physical form today. The Switch console exclusive is a particularly <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/steamworld_quest_hand_of_gilgamech">solid and satisfying card battler</a> well worth your time, but there's another reason you might want to pick up a copy, too.</p>
      <p>Super Rare Games has confirmed that, should SteamWorld Quest sell well, it has been given the go-ahead to also release both <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_heist_ultimate_edition"><b>SteamWorld Heist</b></a> and <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/steamworld_dig"><b>SteamWorld Dig: A Fistful of Dirt</b></a> in lovely physical form. If you're hoping to have a full set of SteamWorld games on your shelf, this sounds like a pretty good opportunity.</p>
      <p>SteamWorld Quest will be going live on the site at 6pm UK time today (so that's 10am PT / 1pm ET / 7pm CET) and will be available for £30. It comes with all of the usual Super Rare extras which you can see below and is limited to 7,000 copies.</p>
