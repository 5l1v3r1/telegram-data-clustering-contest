      <h1>A persuasive argument for taking down the Mona Lisa</h1>

      <p>According to the Louvre museum, 80 percent of 10 million people who visit the famed Paris art museum come to see the Mona Lisa. "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jason-farago">[A]nd most of them leave unhappy</a>," writes Jason Farago, art critic for <i>The New York Times</i>. He recently went to the Louvre and described the dreadful experience:</p>
      <blockquote>[Y]ou must line up in a hideous, T.S.A.-style snake of retractable barriers that ends about 12 feet from the Leonardo — which, for a painting that’s just two and a half feet tall, is too far for looking and way too far for a good selfie.<br/><br/>Apparently the painting is beneath some nifty new nonreflective glass, but at this distance how could I tell? My fellow visitors and I could hardly see the thing, and we were shunted off in less than a minute. All this for a painting that (as the Louvre’s current show confirms) is hardly Leonardo’s most interesting, and that has drowned out the Venetian masterpieces in the Salle des États, such as Titian’s “<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Titian_-_Woman_with_a_Mirror_-_WGA22913.jpg">Woman With a Mirror</a>,” or Veronese’s “<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Paolo_Veronese%2C_The_Wedding_at_Cana.JPG">Wedding at Cana</a>,” which Beyoncé was smart enough not to neglect. The museum is admitting as much with the pathetic new signs in the Salle des États: “The Mona Lisa is surrounded by other masterpieces — take a look around the room.”</blockquote>
