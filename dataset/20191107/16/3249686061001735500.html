      <p><b>Super Junior</b>'s <b>Heechul</b> drew attention when viewers noticed a Sphinx cat in the background of his broadcast. </p>
      <p>On November 6, the entertainer was seen holding a live broadcast on YouTube to celebrate<b> Super Junior</b>'s 14th anniversary when a Sphinx cat was seen peeking his face out into the broadcast. Curious fans asked where the cat was from, but Heechul only replied that <i>"it's a secret."</i></p>
      <p>Netizens are now saying that the cat used to belong to <b>Sulli</b>, noting that the two go way back. What do you think?</p>
