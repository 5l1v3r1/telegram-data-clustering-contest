      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles’ <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/malcolm-jenkins/"><b>Malcolm Jenkins</b></a> released a PSA video that focuses on Black children being killed by police, and he’s partnered with <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/jay-z/"><b>Jay-Z</b></a>‘s Roc Nation to do it.</p>
      <p>Jenkins released the video through his Players Coalition, a social justice group that he founded with former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin in 2017.</p>

      <p>Roc Nation <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/06/malcolm-jenkins-roc-nation-psa-everyones-child-responsibility-program/">reportedly</a> spent $1 million to promote the video on social media as well as other areas, and people like <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/meek-mill/"><b>Meek Mill</b></a> and CNN contributor <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/van-jones/"><b>Van Jones</b></a> tweeted about it.</p>
      <p>Mill and Jones partnered with Jay-Z for <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/01/24/jay-z-meek-mill-van-jones-aim-to-cut-probation-parole-rolls-by-one-million-over-five-years/">The Reform Alliance</a> earlier this year, a criminal justice reform organization they started with people like Philadelphia 76ers co-owner <b><a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/michael-rubin/">Michael Rubin</a></b> and New England Patriots owner <a href="http://atlantablackstar.com/tag/robert-kraft/"><b>Robert Kraft</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The PSA is narrated by Angella and Dan Henry, who are the parents of <b>Danroy “DJ” Henry Jr.</b>, a student football player for Pace University, who was killed by a white police officer named Aaron Hess in 2010.</p>
      <p>The shooting happened in Mount Pleasant, New York, while DJ was driving, and he was just 20 years old at the time.</p>
      <p>Hess and another officer said the young man drove toward them aggressively, but later it was learned their story was fabricated, resulting in a $6 million wrongful death settlement for the family.</p>
      <p>“Never in a million years would we have thought this would have happened to us,” said Angella Henry in the video. “And it continues to happen to so many other families.”</p>
      <p>Jay-Z announced <a href="https://atlantablackstar.com/2019/08/14/jay-z-partners-with-the-nfl-to-increase-social-justice-initiatives-and-handle-musical-events/">his partnership</a> with the NFL in August to help the league with its entertainment and social justice initiatives.</p>
      <p>As a part of it, the billionaire rapper will create a series of videos similar to Jenkins’ PSA through his new “Responsibility Program.” The plan with the videos is to raise awareness on social justice and to spark legislative change.</p>
      <p>The future PSAs will also have backing from major corporations.</p>
