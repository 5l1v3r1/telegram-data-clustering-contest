      <h1>Kansas City voters strip Martin Luther King from street name</h1>

      <p>Washington (AFP) - Nine months after a boulevard in Kansas City, Missouri, was renamed for US civil rights leader Martin Luther King, voters have decided to switch back to its historic name.</p>
      <p>The 10-mile (16-kilometer) street was originally known as The Paseo but was changed to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard in an 8-4 vote by the city council in January.</p>
      <p>A group called "Save the Paseo" launched a drive to reverse the move and nearly 70 percent of the voters who took part in Tuesday's election agreed that the boulevard should revert to its original name.</p>
      <p>According to the Kansas City Star, about 100 street signs will now have to be taken down.</p>
      <p>Diane Euston, a member of Save the Paseo, told the newspaper the group felt that King should be honored but the city council had ignored a rule that 75 percent of residents agree before any changes are made to street names.</p>
      <p>On its website, Save the Paseo said its goal is to "preserve the name of KC's most historic boulevard and find a way to honor Dr King that brings the city together."</p>
      <p>According to the Star, Kansas City is one of the only major cities in the United States without a street named for King, who was assassinated in 1968.</p>
      <p>Reverend Vernon Howard, president of the Kansas City chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a group founded by King, said it was a "shameful day for Kansas City."</p>
      <p>"We are one of the five most violent and crime ridden cities in this nation," Howard said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The blood of our children flows through the streets. Yet the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize Winner was rejected by most of us as a symbol of who we are in this town."</p>
