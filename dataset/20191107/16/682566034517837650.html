      <p>Cape Town - <b>Cape Town</b> midfielder <b>Mark Mayambela</b> admits it was not easy for the players to see <b>Benni McCarthy</b> leave the club, but they have to be fully behind the new coach.</p>
      <p>McCarthy was sacked as head coach late on Sunday and the Citizens have moved quickly to replace the former Bafana striker.</p>
      <p>Dutch coach <b>Jan Olde Riekerink</b>, who had spells at big clubs in Europe such as Ajax Amsterdam, Galatasaray and Heerenveen was announced as the new mentor of the Cape club on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Myamabela, who signed for City this season only after McCarthy pressured chairman John Comitis to strike a deal, says the club is more important than one individual.</p>
      <p>"Well like in any other team it's not easy you see. Coach Benni was here for three seasons," Mayambela told <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/mark-mayambela-cape-town-city-players-also-to-blame-for-benni-mccarthy-sacking/666966">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"So, the players were used to him, used to his way of playing, his way of doing things. It's never easy to lose a coach.</p>
      <p>"But then what's important for us now is to support the team, and to support the decision that the team made. To support the coaches that will be here.</p>
      <p>"We also need to support fully the new coach. Because at the end of the day the team is more important than any player or any person.</p>
      <p>"What is important is the team and making sure that the team progresses and does better."</p>
      <p>Cape Town started life after McCarthy with a 5-3 victory over Polokwane City on Wednesday for just their second win of the league season.</p>
