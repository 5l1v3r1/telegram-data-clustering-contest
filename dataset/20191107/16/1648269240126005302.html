      <h1>Karma Teases SC2 Coupe Concept Debut For LA Auto Show</h1>
      <h2>The single image suggests this is a hardtop take on the company's earlier roadster concept.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T16:17:06+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/chris-bruce/" target="_blank">Chris Bruce</a></address>
      <p>Here is the first glimpse of the Karma SC2 concept ahead of its debut at the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/la-auto-show/">2019 Los Angeles Auto Show</a>. It arrives at the event along with a high-performance <a href="https://www.motor1.com/karma/revero/">Revero GTS</a>.</p>
      <p>The teaser image only shows half of the SC2 in a photo looking down at its roof. Karma refers to the vehicle as an "evolution of the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/344954/karma-sc1-vision-concept-unveiled/">dramatic SC1 Vision Concept</a>" (gallery below). Unlike the predecessor, the new vehicle is a hardtop rather than a roadster. Judging by the door seams, there appears to be a massive opening for entering each side similar to the ones on the SC1. A long nose and short rear deck give the machine a classic sports car shape. </p>

      <p>The company also hints that it wants to expand beyond just being an automaker and intends to outline some of the plans during the LA Auto Show. "Karma is evolving beyond a car company to become a tech-driven brand equally focused on being an important engineering, design, customization resource, and high-tech incubator to others," CEO Dr. Lance Zhou, said in the SC2's teaser.</p>
      <p>Karma indicates that the look of the SC1 and SC2 influences the company's next production vehicles. In the meantime, the Revero GTS would offer a meaner version of the company's existing model. When the automaker introduced the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/344914/2020-karma-revero-gt-revealed/">Revero GT at the Shanghai Motor Show</a>, it said the GTS was able to reach 60 mph (96 kph) in 3.9 seconds and scheduled the on-sale date for early 2020.</p>

        <p>As our name implies, Southern California-based Karma Group is more than just a car company. Although we are best known as a creator of soul-stirring luxury electric vehicles, Karma has emerged as a high-tech incubator offering innovators a perfect platform to prove their emerging technologies. Founded in 2014, Karma is reinventing the traditional retail-based automotive business model to create non-traditional value by opening its engineering, design, customization and manufacturing resources to other companies looking to speed product development, access new technology, or make their products more luxurious. The Revero GT is a luxury electric vehicle powered by dual electric motors that embodies Karma’s goals of offering leading automotive design, technology, customization and an outstanding customer experience. Our growing number of retail partners in North America is accepting pre-orders of the Revero GT now with first deliveries expected during the fourth quarter of 2019. Every Revero GT is created with great individual care and world-class craftsmanship at the Karma Innovation and Customization Center in Moreno Valley, Calif.</p>
