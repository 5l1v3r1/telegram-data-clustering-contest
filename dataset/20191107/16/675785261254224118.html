      <address><time datetime="2019-11-07T16:38:33+00:00">07 Nov 2019, 16:38</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A blind 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two of her teachers at her boarding school.</p>
      <p>Police say Chaman Thakor, 62, and Jayanti Thakor, 30, have fled after the offences and a manhunt is underway.</p>
      <p>They've been sacked by the school in Ambaji, west India, which says it is assisting with the investigation.</p>
      <p>The girl broke down and told her aunt of the ordeal recently.</p>
      <p>It's said Thakor raped her in September, shortly after the youngster enrolled at the music school.</p>
      <p>And the older man allegedly raped the child just three days later in the same room.</p>
      <p>JB Agrawat, who is leading the investigation, says further detail isn't clear at this stage.</p>

      <p>Protests to end what has been described as a "rape culture" have taken place in India lately.</p>

      <p>A wife was raped by a group of men and forced by her ex-husband to drink acid in one shocking case last month.</p>
      <p>The amount of rapes recorded in India is almost 40,000 each year, according to official figures.Â </p>
      <p>But campaigners say the real number is higher, with victims wary of filing cases because of the social stigma and a lack of faith in investigators.</p>
