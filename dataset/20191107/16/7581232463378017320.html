      <p>Transcriptome studies evaluating whole blood and tissues are often confounded by overrepresentation of highly abundant transcripts, which compete with and prevent detection of rare RNA transcripts, obscuring their biological importance.<br/><br/>In this webinar, we will discuss Long-DASH, an adapted CRISPR/Cas9-based method, to deplete highly-abundant transcripts for isoform-level transcriptome analysis using long-read sequencing in a non-model organism.<br/><br/>We will demonstrate how we used Long-DASH to sequence full-length cDNA using Oxford Nanopore R2C2 long-read and Illumina Smart-seq2 approaches and applied the method to create an isoform-level transcriptome from whole blood samples derived from polar bears (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>).<br/><br/>Here viewers should expect to learn:<br/>- How to deplete unwanted transcripts using Long-DASH<br/>- About the R2C2 method and C3POa pipeline to improve accuracy<br/>- How to identify isoforms using Mandalorion<br/>- How to identify novel un-annotated isoforms using SQA</p>
