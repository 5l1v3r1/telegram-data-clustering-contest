      <p>SINGAPORE: When posing as other men to lure girls for paid sex did not work, a married man pretended to be a woman instead and offered girls the "opportunity" to earn money for sex acts.</p>
      <p>He then posed as his own "customers" and had sex with the young girls, paying them amounts ranging from S$50 to S$180 for a variety of acts.</p>

      <p>For 11 charges including sexual penetration of minors, commercial sex with minors and making obscene films, Angelo Anwyll Goh Hao-Yi, 34, was sentenced to four years and 10 months' jail on Thursday (Nov 7).</p>
      <p>Another 15 charges were taken into consideration.</p>
      <p>The court heard that the father of three had tried engaging girls for sex using several fake male profiles but did not receive any response. </p>
      <p>He decided to pose as a woman, starting a Facebook account in May 2016 and adopting the persona of a "Vacinta Koh", who was below 20 like his intended targets.</p>
      <p>Goh then sent friend requests to young girls he fancied on Facebook, chatting them up if they accepted.</p>
      <p>He asked the girls if they wanted to earn "quick money" of between S$100 to S$200 per hour to work as a "part-time girlfriend" or "escort".</p>
      <p>"Vacinta" pretended that she was also doing such jobs and could recommend "nice clients", said Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Pei Wei.</p>
      <p>He would arrange for girls who took up his offer to meet "a client", who was in fact himself.</p>
      <p>"Vacinta" told the girls the rates for each sexual act performed were S$60 for penile-vaginal penetration, S$30 for fellatio and S$100 for both, with additional costs for anal penetration.</p>
      <p>They would be paid an additional S$10 for wearing school uniforms during the encounter and an extra S$20 to be filmed during sex.</p>
      <p>He ran this scheme for about two years until Apr 2, 2018, and had more than 2,000 friends on Vacinta's Facebook account at the time of investigations.</p>
      <p>The eight victims he had were aged between 13 and 17.</p>
      <p>
        <b>ONE VICTIM LOST HER VIRGINITY TO GOH FOR S$80</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the victims was 15 when she received a friend request from Goh posing as Vacinta.</p>
      <p>She was initially reluctant to accept the job offer but Goh convinced her by claiming there were younger girls earning money the same way.</p>
      <p>Goh posed as a client named Ken and picked the victim up near her school in his black BMW convertible on Feb 2, 2018.</p>
      <p>He then drove to a hotel where he set up his phone to film the encounter and had sex with the girl.</p>
      <p>The victim, who was a virgin, felt a sharp pain and told Goh about it. He told her to relax and continued, before paying her S$80.</p>
      <p>On another occasion, he filmed a 17-year-old victim during oral sex, and refused to delete the clip when she asked him to.</p>
      <p>He chatted up another victim, who was 14, by pretending that "Vacinta" had also been raped. The teenager had told him that she had previously been raped.</p>
      <p>He paid the girl S$60 each for two occasions of sexual activity, once in a hotel and then in a car park.</p>
      <p>The youngest victim, a 13-year-old girl, initially declined the job offer, but Goh persisted.</p>
      <p>The teenager told him that she was worried about getting pregnant or contracting HIV, but "Vacinta" said she would introduce her to her own regular clients.</p>
      <p>Goh then posed as a client named Ken, picked the girl up at a shopping mall and drove her to an apartment in Ipoh Lane, where he molested her and persuaded her to perform fellatio on him.</p>
      <p>He paid her S$80 and dropped her off at an MRT station.</p>
      <p>Goh was arrested on Apr 2, 2018, and devices seized from him were found to contain 23 obscene films.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor asked for 60 months' jail, pointing out the man's "sheer premeditation and persistence in offending". </p>
      <p>The defence asked for 48 months' jail and was granted a week's deferment of the sentence, after asking for some time for Goh to bond with his three very young kids.</p>
