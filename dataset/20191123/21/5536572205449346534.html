      <p>Just before the San Antonio Spurs would suffer their eight consecutive loss against the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich had a hilarious exchange with reporters when he began trolling Donald Trump.</p>

      <p>A reporter mentioned the team having a tough run with their then-seven-game losing streak, which had Popovich sarcastically saying, “We’re kickin’ ass. Jeez. Fake News. The man was right. Fake news,” he said.</p>
      <p>Popovich echoed more of Trump’s catchphrases in response to the reporter’s comment. “It’s a conspiracy theory. Whoever started the rumor that we’re losing these games, it didn’t happen. It’s not true… It’s a witch hunt. I see intrigue, I see treasonous behavior. I see spies. They’re all sick, all those people saying that. Scum,” he said.</p>

      <p>Popovich has blasted President Donald Trump several times over the years, once calling him a “coward” for leaving Washington, D.C. during the March for Our Lives demonstration to protest gun violence and heading to Mar-a-Lago.</p>
