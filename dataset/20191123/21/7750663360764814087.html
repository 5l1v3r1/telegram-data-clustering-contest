      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dean-smith/"><b>Dean Smith</b></a>'s side were strongly linked with a move for the Algeria international during the summer and allegedly failed with a number of offers ahead of the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Benrahma scored 11 times in 45 outings for Brentford last season while he has contributed two goals and two assists in 14 Championship outings this term.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Sky Sports News</i>, despite failing to secure his services over the summer, Villa remain interested in a swoop for the 24-year-old ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Brentford still value the attacker in the region of Â£20m, though, which is a figure that Smith's side were not prepared to pay over the summer.</p>
      <p>Villa will resume their Premier League campaign at home to Newcastle United on Monday night.</p>
