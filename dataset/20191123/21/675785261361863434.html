      <p>Towie diva Gemma Collins has decided it is time to join a more exclusive club – the Illuminati.</p>
      <p>The star has revealed she is hooked on conspiracy theories that a secret society is using top celebrities like puppets as it slowly builds its totalitarian “New World Order”.</p>
      <p>And she says she is prepared to “sell her soul to the devil” to sign up.</p>
      <p>Gemma, 38, said: “I’m now thinking should I become Illuminati? Who do I need to call to become Illuminati?</p>
      <p>"As you know, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rihanna">Rihanna</a>, Britney Spears, Cardi B, the Kardashians apparently, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/angelina-jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, Katie Perry are all part of this – Jay Z and Beyoncé. </p>

      <p>“I believe this and have always said there is more to life than we know.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on her BBC Sounds podcast, Gemma even invited the group to get in touch.</p>
      <p>She said: “They are giving a subliminal message. It all comes back to mind control. Any members of the IIluminati, feel free to come on my podcast. I’m not scared of it, I’d like to know more.</p>
      <p>“Apparently, they offer wealth, power and world domination – but in return you sell your soul to the devil. I did ask someone once – I won’t mention their name – how I join and he said I had to call <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jay-z">Jay-Z</a>.”</p>
      <p>Gemma added that she believes in mind control because of her unusual “energy vibration”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I radiate on a different frequency – or you can call it energy – than most. I vibrate at a different energy force.</p>
      <p>"The reason I know I’m different to other people is I’m awake in the night, like all mythical creatures.”</p>
