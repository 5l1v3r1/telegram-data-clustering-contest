      <p>The I'm A Celebrity site is in lockdown with a killer on the loose near the camp.</p>
      <p>Show bosses have reportedly tightened security to make the camp impenetrable after a man's body was found at Jack Evans Boat Harbour Park at around 11am on Friday.</p>
      <p>New South Wales police have launched a massive manhunt after a horrified couple found the dead man in a sleeping bag while walking their dog.</p>
      <p>Members of the Homicide Squad have established a crime scene and are conducting a canvass of the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cullen revealed the man was found with "physical wounds".</p>

      <p>Sources have told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10409277/im-a-celeb-security-hunt-killer/">The Sun</a> that I'm A Celeb bosses are aware of the ongoing search - with the area over an hour away from the production site.</p>
      <p>One said: “The celebs are being watched 24 hours a day, seven days a week by a team of staff and our security measures are incredibly tight.</p>
      <p>“So there is zero chance of anyone sneaking into camp. But of course it is very unsettling to know that there is someone out there, running from the police, who has committed such a horrible crime.”</p>
      <p>The celebrities in camp, who are completely cut off from the outside world, have no idea what is happening.</p>

      <p>New South Wales police are treating the death of the man as suspicious and want to talk to anyone who noticed any unusual activity.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Brendon Cullen told <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-22/tweed-heads-body-found-in-sleeping-bag/11730258">ABC</a> : "The movements and the history of the victim is something that we are in the early stages of establishing.</p>
      <p>"We are very keen to speak to any person that was in Jack Evans Boat Harbour yesterday evening and this morning who might have seen something or know anything about this.</p>
      <p>"We do want to establish where this man is from and how he came to be in the state he is in now."</p>

        <figcaption>The camp site is an hour away from where the body was found<cite>(Image: ITV)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Inquiries are now underway by Tweed/Byron detectives – assisted by detectives from State Crime Command’s Homicide Squad – into the circumstances surrounding the man’s death.</p>
      <p>A postmortem on the man, who is believed to be in his 50s, will be conducted in coming days to determine the cause of death and to confirm his identity.</p>
      <p>Police are appealing for anyone with information about this incident to call Tweed Heads Police or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that a killer has been on the loose near the camp.</p>

        <figcaption>Two murderers were on the loose in 2014</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Back in 2014, a woman was found dead in the street in Murwillumbah, the town just ten minutes from where the celebs are camping, causing police to worry their suspect is hiding out in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The body of Lynette Jones, 52, was found with the coroner saying the death of the mother-of-two was "suspicious".</p>
      <p>The tragic news emerged just hours after the Mirror revealed another murderer was on the loose following an attack less than an hour away from the site.</p>
      <p>A man was bludgeoned to death with a tennis racquet in Coomera, less than an hour away from the jungle and the killer is still at large, with locals at the time claiming he was in hiding in a rural area closeby.</p>
      <p>Mark Spencer, 37, was beaten to death on the back patio of his home in Coomera in the early hours of October 1.</p>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity bosses are also on red alert for bush fires as they burn their way through Australia.</p>
      <p>At least three people are dead and thousands have been displaced by bushfires in Oz this month - with more than 100 blazes still burning.</p>
      <p>I'm A Celeb staff are “closely monitoring” if they need to evacuate from the jungle site after there were huge bushfires in the area.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the military could be called upon to support the 1,300 firefighters working in the two states.</p>

      <p>And the deputy mayor of Tweed Shire Chris Cherry recently spoke about the hot weather in the area of Murwillumbah, where the I'm A Celeb show is based in the North East of NSW close to its border with Queensland.</p>
      <p>She said: “Our main concern for the area is bush fires. It has been very hot and dry here in the past months and although this is a rain forest area, bush fires are now an issue we need to seriously think about. It’s bad.”</p>
      <p>An ITV Spokesman told the Mirror: “We are in constant contact with the NSW fire brigade and are closely monitoring the situation. We currently have no cause for concern. The health and safety of all our production crew and celebrities are of the utmost importance.”</p>
