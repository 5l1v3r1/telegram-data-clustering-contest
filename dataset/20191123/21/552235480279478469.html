      <h1>Celtic in Europa League boost as Rennes suffer disappointing defeat ahead of Parkhead clash</h1>
      <h2>Celtic have qualified for the knockout phase but a win against the French side will go a long way in their bid to top the group.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:11:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Rennes suffered a disappointing 2-1 defeat to Dijon ahead of Thursday's match against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> .</p>
      <p>The French side will visit Parkhead for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> clash as top of the group meets bottom.</p>
      <p>Celtic have qualified for the knockout phase after back-to-back wins against Lazio, but three points will go a long way in their bid to go through as group winners.</p>
      <p>And their opponents failed to take any points against Ligue 1 strugglers Dijon on Saturday evening as they continue their poor start to the season.</p>

      <p>Raphinha opened the scoring for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rennes">Rennes</a> just before the half hour mark, but the visitors conceded two goals in the space of 12 minutes to give up their lead.</p>
      <p>Frederic Sammaritano equalised with 20 minutes to go before Mounir Chouiar secured all three points for the home side.</p>
      <p>Celtic can qualify for the last 32 against the French outfit depending on how Cluj fare against Lazio in the other group game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> 's kept their winning run going with a convincing 4-0 win over Livingston and the Hoops gaffer says he will not be resting any of his key players against Rennes as he looks to keep his side at the peak of Group E.</p>
