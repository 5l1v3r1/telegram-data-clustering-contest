      <p>A collection of artistic talent from around the Ballarat region is set to be showcased in Newlyn as the Moorabool Writers Craft launch their new anthology book, 'Cry of the Curlew'.</p>
      <p>Contributing writer and musician Vanessa Craven said she is excited to launch the project which features fiction, non-fiction and a collection of poems.</p>
      <p>"It's so exciting to be releasing it because it's been born of hard work... people who are enthusiastic and want to create," she said.</p>
      <p>The free festival will feature live readings from the new book, along with music, art, food and drinks at Newlyn's Scrub Hill 1869.</p>
      <p>Ms Craven said having a free festival on offer is very important in promoting art to the wider community and encourage involvement within groups like the Moorabool Writers Craft.</p>
      <p>"I think making events like this accessible is really important... having a free event is a great way of introducing people to the various groups that will be there which will hopefully encourage people to get involved."</p>
