      <h1>Thieves on the run with huge T Rex after heartless reptilian robbery</h1>
      <h2>The dinosaur was a stand-out performer in the Brasilica Liverpool carnival this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:42:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/luke-traynor/" target="_blank">Luke Traynor</a></address>
      <p>Reptilian thieves are currently on the run with this huge lifelike Tyrannosaurus Rex, pinched from outside a home today in Whiston.</p>
      <p>The massive and unmistakable model was in the back of a white Ford Luton van, along with a smaller Triceratops, at around 2am this morning, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/whiston">which was stolen by crooks.</a></p>
      <p>The animatronic dinosaur, which performers climb inside to operate, which <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/animals">rolls its eyes and makes realistic roaring sounds,</a> belongs to Lisa Watson, who runs her own business call Lucas Sophia.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old is a party supplier and she also had stolen a wooden wishing well, 4ft letters spelling out "LOVE", an Easter bunny costume, and a sweet cart, which are sometimes hired for weddings or other special occasions.</p>
      <p>The three yobs, who had their hoods up, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley">were captured on a neighbour's CCTV,</a> trying to open other vehicle doors, before they broke into the van, and sped away.</p>
      <p>It was last seen travelling towards the M62 motorway, at Tarbock Island.</p>

      <p>According to Lisa, police have been informed and suspect the van could have ended up in Speke.</p>
      <p>The dinosaur, which was shipped over from China, costs £6,000, while the van, with the reg-plate MJ11 YSU, is valued at just under £10,000.</p>
      <p>The dinosaur was a stand-out performer in the Brasilica Liverpool carnival this year.</p>
      <p>Mrs Watson told the ECHO: "I am obviously upset this was all taken.</p>
      <p>"They are hard to replace.</p>
      <p>"The dinosaur is pretty big, so I would think it would be hard to keep him hidden!</p>

      <p>"Those lads must have got a shock when they saw what we had in the back of the van.</p>
      <p>"There wasn't much fuel in the tank, so they couldn't have got far.</p>
      <p>"I'm gutted - it all cost a hell of a lot."</p>
      <p>A Christmas present bought for Mrs Watson's autistic nephew was also pilfered.</p>
