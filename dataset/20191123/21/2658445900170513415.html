      <h3>Sentry</h3>
      <p>Given its victory in the just concluded governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states, the camp of the All Progressives Congress ought to be bustling with excitement. But while party members in the affected states are happy with the turn of events, it is not exactly the case in the party at the national level.</p>
      <p>Some influential individuals within the ruling party were alleged to have funded one of the governorship candidates of the PDP. One of such sponsors, who hails from the South-south, was said to have been motivated by petty jealousy, as he feared that Timipre Silva, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources and main backer of APC candidate David Lyon, would claim credit for the latterâ€™s victory.</p>
      <p>One of them was said to have given the PDP governorship candidate in question the sum of N500 million; an action said to have infuriated some APC members from the South-south, who are now bent on reporting the culprits to the Presidency for them to take due notice in the calculations for 2023.</p>
      <p>Although Sentry could not confirm the payment of the said sum at press time, the allegation is nonetheless a threat to harmony in the ruling party.</p>
