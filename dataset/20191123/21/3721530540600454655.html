      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/state-of-decay-2/39150"><i>State of Decay 2</i></a><i> </i>will be available on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/steam">Steam</a> sometime next year, joining <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/gears-5/40385"><i>Gears 5</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/halo-the-master-chief-collection/37217"><i>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</i></a><i> </i>as Microsoft Game Studios titles moving over to Valve’s marketplace.</p>
      <p>The game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2/">Steam page</a> gives an early 2020 release date. <a href="https://www.stateofdecay.com/2019/11/22/state-of-decay-2-is-coming-to-steam/">Undead Labs said yesterday</a> that the Steam version will support cross-platform play with Xbox Live, same as the version available on the Microsoft Store for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/windows">Windows</a> 10.</p>
      <p>The first <i>State of Decay</i> launched in 2013 as an Xbox/Windows exclusive, but was (and still is) sold on Steam. Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/10/17446694/microsoft-xbox-internal-studios-exclusives">acquired Undead Labs last year</a>, shortly after <i>State of Decay</i><i> 2</i> launched in May 2018.</p>
      <p>In May, Xbox chief Phil Spencer said Microsoft had plans to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/30/18645591/microsoft-pc-games-steam-win32-support-windows-10">expand its offerings on competing digital storefronts</a>, following the announcement in March that <i>Halo</i><i>: The Master Chief Collection </i>would launch on Steam as well as the Microsoft Store. <i>Gears 5 </i>launched on both storefronts at the beginning of September.</p>
      <p>Undead Labs said it would give out more details in a livestream on Monday at 6 p.m. EST.</p>
