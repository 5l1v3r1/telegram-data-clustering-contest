      <h1>Kyle Edmund gives Great Britain lead in Davis Cup semi-final</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kyle-edmund/"><b>Kyle Edmund</b></a> continued his brilliant form in Madrid to give Great Britain a 1-0 lead in their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/tennis/davis-cup/"><b>Davis Cup</b></a> semi-final against Spain at the Caja Magica.</h2>

      <p>This time it was no surprise to see <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-murray/"><b>Andy Murray</b></a> left on the bench after the performances of Edmund and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dan-evans/"><b>Dan Evans</b></a> in steering Britain to victory over Germany on Friday.</p>
      <p>Edmund had expected to face <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pablo-carreno-busta/"><b>Pablo Carreno Busta</b></a> only for Spain to make a very late switch when he was ruled out with a thigh injury, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/feliciano-lopez/"><b>Feliciano Lopez</b></a> coming in instead.</p>
      <p>The timing certainly raised eyebrows given rumours were circulating about the fitness of Carreno Busta on Friday evening but Edmund, unfazed, powered to a 6-3 7-6 (3) victory to put Leon Smith's side within one rubber of a final against Canada.</p>

      <p>Appeals by Murray and the British team and a through-the-night effort from the Lawn Tennis Association brought an extra 800 fans to Madrid for the clash.</p>
      <p>The LTA invested more than £60,000 of the considerable prize money it will receive in purchasing tickets and then offering them free to any British supporters who could get to the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>The visiting fans were, of course, still heavily outnumbered in the 12,500-seat stadium – a big contrast from the small arenas in which Britain had played their first three matches.</p>
      <p>If Spain had hoped the late change might disrupt the exceptional rhythm Edmund has been in all week, they were quickly disabused of that notion.</p>

      <p>The Yorkshireman began the match with three aces and won eight of the first nine points to claim an immediate break of serve.</p>
      <p>It was no surprise the 38-year-old, who won the Queen's Club title in June but plays more doubles these days, started a little nervously given he had not contested a Davis Cup singles match since 2016.</p>
      <p>He freed himself up as the first set went on, with his big serve keeping Edmund at arm's length, but did not force a break point.</p>
      <p>The British number three was again in remarkable form for a player who has struggled all season, serving strongly and powering away winners.</p>
      <p>Edmund is known for his destructive forehand but his backhand has been the revelation of this tournament and he used it very well again here.</p>

      <p>The Lopez serve and the hostile atmosphere were ramping up the pressure on Edmund, though, and a forehand powered just wide gave the Spaniard two set points at 4-5 in the second set.</p>
      <p>Edmund kept his nerve superbly, though, sending down big serves to save them both, and was much the better player in the tie-break.</p>
      <p>It was an essential victory for Britain with Rafael Nadal taking a 26-match unbeaten run in singles into his clash with Evans.</p>
