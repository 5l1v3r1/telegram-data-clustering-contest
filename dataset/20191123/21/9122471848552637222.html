      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Ohio State showed it is the best team in the Big Ten by handling Penn State at home.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes dominated on the ground in the first half. Despite a furious comeback attempt from Penn State, Ohio State held on to walk out with a 28-17 win and take control of the Big Ten East.</p>
      <p>After the game, ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit sent a message to Ohio State and Penn State players.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>
      <p>“Great game. Ohio State beats a very motivated and determined Penn State team. Buckeyes clinch a trip to Indy w/ the win &amp; now turn their attention towards Michigan week!! And the Lions finish with a lay up vs Rutgers &amp; a 10-2 year AND a well deserved NY6 bowl bid!” Herbstreit said.</p>
