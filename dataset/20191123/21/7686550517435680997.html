      <p>Officers were called to the scene at around 5.35pm after reports that a gang with machetes had arrived at the cinema within the Nechells complex.</p>
      <p>Around 60 to 70 people allegedly started fighting in the packed entertainment complex near Nechells.</p>
      <p>Vue Cinema was evacuated and placed on lockdown.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: "A number of arrests have been made following disorder at Star City in Birmingham tonight.</p>
      <p>"We were called just before 5.35pm to reports that a group of people with machetes had arrived at the cinema within the complex.</p>
      <p>"Officers arrived to find a group of more than 100 people, and pockets of fighting broke out as police moved to clear the area.</p>
      <p>"A number of police officers have been assaulted, and several arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>"A dispersal order has been out in place giving officers the power to move on groups of people and arrest those who fail to leave. Officers remain at the scene and are liaising closely with management at the venue. Motorists are urged to avoid the area because of traffic build-up."</p>

      <p>A witness has described the terrifying scene as 'one of the scariest moments of my life.'</p>
      <p>Rachel Allison tweeted: “Just came to see the new Blue Story film, standing in line for snacks when a fight breaks out behind my brother - worst thing is, it’s young girls fighting. Police brought batons, tasers and dogs out. Star City now closed.”</p>
      <p>One witness told Mirror Online: "That's probably one of the scariest moments of my life. Me and my daughter were in a queue to watch frozen, loads of little kids there, all dressed up and everything, then these girls jumped on another girl and loads of these kids just started fighting.</p>
      <p>"Armed police came with Tasers. All the people that were fighting run off into the cinema. There’s about 15 to 20 police cars. I’m shaking."</p>
