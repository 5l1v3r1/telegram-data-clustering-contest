      <p>SHERBROOKE, Que. — Drummondville Mayor Alexandre Cusson is throwing his hat in the ring for the Quebec Liberal leadership.</p>
      <p>Cusson, who stepped down as head of the province's municipalities union and became a card-carrying Liberal last week, becomes the second contender to the top spot since Philippe Couillard resigned in October 2018 following the Liberal's election loss.</p>
      <p>Dominique Anglade, Couillard's former deputy premier and economic development minister who represents the Montreal riding of Saint-Henri–Sainte-Anne, announced in June she will run for leader.</p>
      <p>Cusson has been drumming up support among Liberal caucus members and activists in a whirl of phone calls and meetings over the past week. Anglade has secured the backing of at least 11 of her colleagues in the National Assembly.</p>
      <p>Quebec Liberals are scheduled to elect a new chief in May, with the contest officially kicking off this weekend at the party's general council meeting in Sherbrooke, Que.</p>
      <p>Cusson, flanked by lawmakers and activists at the event Saturday morning, described himself as a Quebec nationalist but one who's proud of his Canadian identity — "a very strong value."</p>
      <p>Cusson remained cautious about his policy positions, declining to comment on various controversial issues including Quebec's secularism act, which prohibits some public employees from wearing religious symbols.</p>
      <p>"I do not want to get into the specific issues," he told reporters repeatedly.</p>
      <p>The eventual leader of the Official Opposition will square off against Premier Francois Legault's Coalition Avenir Quebec, which swept to power in 2018 on a platform promising a hard line on immigration and religious garb in the civil service.</p>
      <p>Cusson said he sees himself as a "unifying" leader and hopes the party election will not descend into "Montreal against the regions," though he spoke in favour of greater devolution of power to the regions.</p>
      <p>Cusson has cast ballots only for the provincial Liberal party and voted "no" in the 1995 referendum on Quebec sovereignty, he said.</p>
      <p>He said he will resign as Drummondville mayor at the end of January 2020, after the city's new budget is implemented.</p>
