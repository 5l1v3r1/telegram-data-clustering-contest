      <p>PHILADELPHIA - Matthew Tkachuk scored the only goal in the shootout, and the Calgary Flames beat the Philadelphia Flyers 3-2 on Saturday to stop a six-game slide.</p>
      <p>Calgary’s Elias Lindholm tied it at 2 when he scored with 1:23 left in regulation. Andrew Mangiapane also scored for the Flames, who were shut out in their previous three road games as part of their skid.</p>
      <p>Kevin Hayes and Jakub Voracek scored for Philadelphia, which lost for the fifth time in six games.</p>
      <p>David Rittich made 27 saves and stopped all three Flyers attempts in the tiebreaker. Tkachuk, Calgary’s second shooter, scored on a backhander that went through Carter Hart’s legs.</p>
