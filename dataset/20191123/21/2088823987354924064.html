      <p>CLARKSVILLE – A teenager charged with killing his parents in this remote Allegany County town dropped out of high school shortly before the murders and was living in their log home for more than two weeks after they reportedly were shot to death.</p>
      <p>Bruce L. Hitchcock said he had been helping William J. Larson Jr., 17, for several weeks, often supplying meals for his neighbor, who claimed his mother, Lisa Larson, was ill from eating bad food.</p>
      <p>William J. Larson Jr., known by neighbors as Billy, gave no indication that anything was amiss at the log home on a hill on Courtney Hollow Road, said Hitchcock.</p>
      <p>“I was basically taking care of him these past three weeks. I had no idea his parents were dead up there. It blows my mind,” said Hitchcock. “The whole time he acts like nothing’s going on.”</p>
      <p>State Police charged Billy Larson with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree manslaughter following a fire at 8472 Courtney Hollow Road, where he lived with his parents, William J. and Lisa L. Larson. Firefighters and emergency crews discovered two bodies at the home. State Police confirmed the identities of the victims on Sunday.</p>
      <p>WGRZ-TV obtained felony complaint documents Friday stating that the murders were alleged to have happened on Nov. 5, 16 days before the bodies were discovered.</p>

      <p>The Mark F. Rinker Funeral Home in Cuba on Saturday included on its website a <a href="http://www.rinkerfuneralhome.com/lisallarsonandwilliamjlarson.html">brief obituary for William and Lisa Larson</a> that states the couple died on Nov. 21, the date of the fire. Services for them are scheduled Tuesday at the funeral home.</p>
      <p>Hitchcock said he last saw Lisa Larson on Nov. 4. Hitchcock and his wife in 2018 began renting a house from the Larsons on neighboring property, and Lisa Larson was at their home helping to install insulation, he said.</p>
      <p>“Lisa was a sweetheart. She loved helping people,” said Hitchcock.</p>

      <p>Hitchcock said he and his wife were in the process of buying the house from the Larsons along with a couple acres of land.</p>
      <p>“I thought the world of them,” he said. “They weren’t a normal family, but they were cool. They were good people.”</p>
      <p>Hitchcock said Billy Larson recently had displayed some odd behavior, and Lisa Larson had expressed some concern about it.</p>

      <p>He recalled Billy Larson repeatedly driving in and out of Hitchcock’s driveway around 1 a.m. He also said Lisa Larson told him she sometimes found her son sleeping inside a vehicle in her driveway early in the morning.</p>
      <p>But Hitchcock said Billy Larson’s behavior wasn’t unusual over the past three weeks, and the teenager gave him no reason to be suspicious about anything.</p>
      <p>He said it wasn’t odd to go a couple weeks without seeing William or Lisa Larson because of the distance between their homes.</p>
      <p>Hitchcock said he even received responses from someone he assumed was Lisa Larson to texts he had sent asking if she was OK. He said he now believes Billy Larson must have responded to his texts.</p>
      <p>Courtney Hollow is a dirt and gravel road that climbs uphill for more than a mile and includes year-round homes and hunting cabins.</p>
      <p>William Larson owned many acres of property in the area, and he built the log house himself, with help from friends, according to neighbors. Neighbors said Lisa Larson, 50, worked at Eaton-Cooper Power Systems, a manufacturing facility, in Olean, and William Larson, 67, was retired or semiretired.</p>
      <p>Some neighbors characterized the family as troubled and said they often could be heard arguing loudly. The Larsons also had a penchant for blaring music in the summer months, said two neighbors who declined to be identified by name.</p>
      <p>“They could hear it all the way down to the valley,” said one of the neighbors.</p>
      <p>The elder Larson, he added, “was the type of guy that if you went up to him and said something about it, he’d fly off the handle.”</p>
      <p>Two neighbors also said that Billy Larson often drove his truck and motorcycle recklessly fast on the pot-marked dirt road. One of the neighbors said Billy Larson “had a lot of problems” at school.</p>
      <p>But the teenager could be disarmingly charming.</p>
      <p>“If you met Billy, he was the politest kid you ever met,” said one of the neighbors. “It’s a sad situation.”</p>
      <p>Two women who showed up at the Larson home Saturday morning identified themselves as relatives of Lisa Larson but declined to comment.</p>
