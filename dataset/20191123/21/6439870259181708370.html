      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - Gaston County emergency officials responded to a house in Cramerton Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>After arriving to the scene on Main Street, firefighters saw that a truck had driven directly into the side of a home.</p>
      <p>Gaston County EMS believes the driver had a medical episode - leading him to crash his vehicle.</p>

      <p>The driver has been transported to CaroMont Regional Medical Center.</p>
      <p>Dylan Windham lives in the house with his dad and brother.</p>
      <p>Dylan said his dad was home and had just gotten up to switch on the lights in his aquarium on his way to the kitchen. Dylan said as his dad stopped at the aquarium, he heard a loud noise - like a gunshot - and hit the floor.</p>
      <p>That’s when he noticed an F-150 in the room he’d just been sitting in.</p>
