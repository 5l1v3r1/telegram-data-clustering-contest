      <h1>Video: Ohio State Fans Have A Message For Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:01:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State picked up its biggest win of the season so far, defeating Penn State in a tightly-contested showdown. Next up for the Buckeyes is a rivalry game against the Michigan Wolverines.</p>
      <p>Before the Buckeyes took the field on Saturday, head coach Ryan Day shared a message for the fans at the Horseshoe.</p>
      <p>“This place has to be a living hell today,” Day told the fans. “Every time their offense touches the football, it has to be louder than the Horseshoe has been.”</p>
      <p>Let’s just say the fans in attendance executed this plan to perfection. Penn State couldn’t even go a single play without dealing with deafening noise from the crowd.</p>
      <p>Following the win, the Buckeyes allowed the students to rush the field.</p>
      <p>Instead of taunting Penn State, the fans shifted their focus over to the team’s next opponent: Michigan.</p>
      <p>Fans were heard singing “We don’t give a damn about the whole state of Michigan.”</p>

      <p>Ohio State fans sing “We don’t give a damn about the whole state of Michigan” all year long, but they’ll really be singing it this upcoming week.</p>
      <p>Even though Ohio State and Penn State have really ramped up their rivalry in recent years, the fans will always have their sights set on Michigan.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Buckeyes dismantled the Wolverines at home. This time around they’ll have to pick up the win on the road in Ann Arbor.</p>
      <p>Expect the fans at The Big House to be as loud as possible next Saturday.</p>
