      <h1>Former Buckeyes Star Taunts Penn State After Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:56:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the Ohio State Buckeyes used an impressive defensive effort to take down the Penn State Nittany Lions by a final score of 28-17.</p>
      <p>The win secures Ohio State’s spot in the Big Ten title game and makes the Buckeyes a virtual lock for the College Football Playoff. Ohio State didn’t quite live up to the insane betting line set by Las Vegas (19.5 points), but a win is a win.</p>
      <p>It’s the third-straight win over the Nittany Lions for the Buckeyes. Following the game, a former Ohio State star decided to taunt Penn State.</p>
      <p>“Penn State our lil homie,” former Buckeyes defensive lineman Jalyn Holmes said.</p>

      <p>Penn State shocked the nation with a win over Ohio State in 2016, but the Nittany Lions haven’t been able to get the upper hand since.</p>
      <p>Next up for Ohio State is a battle against Michigan. The Wolverines aren’t on the same level as the Buckeyes, but the game being played at the Big House should help Jim Harbaugh’s team stay in it – maybe.</p>
      <p>Wins over Penn State and Michigan could see Ohio State vault past LSU as the No. 1 team in the College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>Can the Buckeyes avoid a letdown against the Wolverines and finish the regular season with an undefeated record?</p>
