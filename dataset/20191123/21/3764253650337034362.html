      <p>Four Nigerian groups led by the president of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF), Alhaji Yerima Shettima, have said the source of the plight currently suffered by Allen Onyeama, an airline owner in the country, can be traced to his business rivals.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Ethnic Nationality Youth Leaders Forum (NENYLF) warned that nothing must happen to Onyeama, which it called one of Nigeria's finest businessman, whose activities have benefited the country in no small measure.</p>
      <p>Onyeama is currently facing issues of alleged money laundering <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1278355-allen-onyema-us-issues-warrant-arrest-air-peace-boss.html">for which he was indicted by the United States government</a>.</p>

      <p>However, the group which also consists of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, the Yoruba Council of Youths Worldwide and the Ijaw Youth Council Worldwide, said Onyeama's rising profile had become a source of concern to some people, hence the need to pull him down.</p>
      <p>The coalition said this in a joint statement signed by their heads, Shettima for the AYCF, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro of the Ohanaeze youth, Aremo Oladotun Hassan of the Yoruba council, and Barrister Pereotubo Oweilaemi of the Ijaw youth.</p>
      <p>They noted that they are not against the law taking its course in some situations, there were more to the challenges being suffered by Onyeama currently as they described him as a man who had genuinely done business with the US for many years.</p>
      <p>The coalition questioned the timing of the allegation saying it smacks of conspiracy and collaboration between some Nigerians and the US officials.</p>
      <p><i>"Onyeama has, since built the reputation of a peace promoter who brokered peace between the late President Yar'Adua-led federal government and militants of the Niger-Delta using his well-known platform of peace and reconciliation,"</i> the group said while noting his philanthropically activities.</p>

      <p>Shettima noted how Onyeama played a role during the tension in the country that resulted to the north giving Igbos in the region quit notice adding that he was able to broker the needed peace at the time.</p>
      <p>Apart from creating employment, the coalition noted that Onyeama has been able to touch lives including rescuing Nigerians facing xenophobic attacks in South Africa.</p>
      <p>It warned that it would not keep silent over the issue just as it warned that it would help Onyeama fight using every legitimate means.</p>

      <p><i>"We would like to draw the attention of his Nigerians rivals that we suspect are working hand-in-hand with their American partners that we will follow every legitimate legal means of defending one of the most exemplary Nigerian investors that we have in Mr Onyeama,"</i> the group stated.</p>
