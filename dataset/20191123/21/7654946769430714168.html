      <h1>Construction worker injured in New Orleans Hard Rock Hotel collapse faces deportation</h1>

      <p>A construction worker from Honduras injured <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/12/hard-rock-hotel-new-orleans-construction-site-collapse-kills-one-several-others-missing/">during a Hard Rock Hotel collapse</a> in New Orleans last month is now facing deportation according to his immigration lawyer, <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/courts/article_627af538-0d5b-11ea-9658-cbd2f0d63c2a.html">NOLA.com reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Delmer Joel Ramirez Palma worked at the building and even reportedly attempted to warn his superiors about unsafe conditions before the accident, which left three dead and dozens more injured.</p>
      <p>“He talks about how this disaster could have been avoided if they had been paid more attention when they could see — clearly — that the building, in some areas, wasn’t right,” Palma’s wife, Tania Bueso, told NOLA. “When he used the laser (measurement tool), he also said he had to check two or three times to make sure the measurement was right, because the building was so imbalanced.”</p>
      <p>Palma, who has lived in the Big Easy for 18 years, was booked by Immigration and Custom Enforcement officials two days after the accident. ICE officials later moved him to Alexandria International Airport in central Louisiana to await final deportation — which his family fears could come as early as Monday.</p>
