        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea</p>

      <p><b>Venue</b>: Etihad</p>
      <p>Manchester City got their Premier League back on track after rallying from behind to defeat Chelsea 2-1 at the Etihad on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>City manager Pep Guardiola made five changes to the side that was thrashed by Liverpool before the FIFA break, with goalkeeper Ederson returning from injury, while Benjamin Mendy, David Silva, Joao Cancelo and Riyard Mahrez all earned starting berths.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Frank Lampard made only two alterations in his trusted line-up, with Jorginho returning from suspension while Cesar Azpilicueta started at full-back as Reece James dropped to the bench.</p>
      <p>The Blues dominated in the early exchanges of the first, with the Citizens taking a back-seat and they were rewarded in the 21st minute after N'Golo Kante managed to shrug off Mendy before poking the ball beyond the on-rushing Ederson.</p>
      <p>Guardiola's charges showed the fighting spirit to get back in to the game as they levelled matters eight minutes thereafter thanks to a deflected shot by Kevin De Bruyne, before the Riyad Mahrez completed the turnaround with a superb solo effort seven minutes before the break.</p>
      <p>The Citizens should have went into the break with a two-goal lead after goalkeeper Kepa's poor clearance fell to Sergio Aguero, who could only rattle the upright while Mahrez was unable to profit from the rebound.</p>
      <p>After a quiet start to the second half, Guardiola was forced to make two changes due to injuries as IIkay Gundogan replaced Rodri, while Phil Foden came on for Silva.</p>
      <p>Lampard's decision to throw on Mason Mount and Michy Batshuayi almost paid off in the last ten minutes after Willian pounced on a volley from a counter-attack but his stunning effort was tipped over the bar by Ederson.</p>
      <p>City thought they had bagged third goal in stoppage time after Sterling fired past Kepa from Mahrez's header but the goal was ruled out for offside by the Video Assistant Referee.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Guardiola's charges held on to clinch a vital win to keep their chances alive in the title race, while Chelsea's six-game league winning streak came to an end.</p>
