      <p>Madrid - <b>Kyle Edmund</b> beat Feliciano Lopez in straight sets on Saturday to give <b>Britain </b>a 1-0 lead in their Davis Cup semi-final against hosts <b>Spain</b>.</p>
      <p>The world number 69 claimed a hard-fought 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) win over veteran Lopez, who stepped in as a last-minute replacement for Pablo Carreno Busta.</p>
      <p>The winners will face Canada in Sunday's final after the North Americans edged out Russia in the first last-four tie.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old Lopez was broken in just the second game of the match as Edmund took the opening set, before seeing two set points come and go in the second.</p>
      <p>Edmund clinched his third straight singles victory of the week on his third match point.</p>
      <p>Spain need world number one Rafael Nadal to get past Dan Evans in the second singles clash to set up a deciding doubles rubber between Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski and Marcel Granollers and Lopez.</p>
