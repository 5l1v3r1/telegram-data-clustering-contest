      <p>It was only fitting that the Canisius men’s basketball team won on the big stage Saturday at KeyBank Center.</p>
      <p>For its 150th anniversary, the school honored its All-Sesquicentennial Team at halftime, including Brian Dux, the former Canisius star who was badly injured in a car accident in 2007 in England, but walked to mid-court under his own power when he was honored by the athletic department.</p>
      <p>After the intermission and the celebration, the Golden Griffins went to work in a 61-57 win against St. Bonaventure, and held off a late charge in the final minute by the Bonnies.</p>
      <p>Malik Johnson scored 15 points and Jacco Fritz added 12 points and 10 rebounds for Canisius, which improved to 2-2.</p>
      <p>Kyle Lofton led St. Bonaventure (1-4) with 18 points, and Justin Winston added 14.</p>
      <p>The Griffs counted on their long-range shooting early, but found their footing in the paint and took a 14-11 lead with 13:10 left in the first on Jalanni White’s shot. However, Justin Winston answered seconds later on a 3-pointer that tied the game, and the Griffs and the Bonnie stayed within at least a point of each other until Winston’s shot gave the Bonnies a 21-19 lead.</p>
      <p>But the Griffs grabbed key defensive rebounds in the first half that helped them take a 29-27 lead with 2:52 left on Corey Brown’s 3-point play, after he was fouled by Amadi Ikpeze. Brown’s 3-point play sparked an 8-0 run that helped the Griffs take a 35-27 lead at halftime, after Winston's 3-point attempt just before the buzzer for Bona clanked out.</p>
      <p>Canisius opened its lead to 39-29 less than 90 seconds into the second half, on Fritz's free throws. Fritz wasn’t tentative under the basket, either, as the freshman from the Netherlands had 10 points and five rebounds early in the second half.</p>
      <p>The Griffs opened their lead to as many as 12 points, but the Bonnies cut it to five (48-43) with 9:24 left on Kyle Lofton’s free throws, and again two minutes later at 50-45 on two more free throws by Lofton. Then, with 5:35 left, Lofton hit a jumper that cut Canisius’ lead to 50-47 and forced the Griffs to call a timeout.</p>
      <p>White’s putback of Majesty Brandon’s 3-point attempt opened Canisius’ lead back to five after the timeout, but the Bonnies stayed within at least four in the final minutes, and Ikpeze’s free throws with 1:22 left cut Canisius’ lead to two points.</p>
      <p>But with the Bonnies down 56-54 in the final minute, Canisius’ Johnson drew a charge as Lofton drove the lane with 31 seconds left, and his two free throws opened Canisius’ lead back to four, 58-54. Alejandro Vasquez made only one of three free throws after he was fouled by Corey Brown with 15 seconds left, but Lofton hit a layup with eith seconds left and Johnson answered again with a free throw with 2.3 seconds left.</p>
