      <h1>Roy Keane calls West Ham United an "absolute disgrace"</h1>
      <h2>Former Manchester United captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-keane/"><b>Roy Keane</b></a> branded <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a> an "absolute disgrace" for their performance <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/result/result-mourinho-begins-spurs-reign-with-deserved-win_380335.html">against Tottenham Hotspur</a> on Saturday afternoon.</h2>

      <p>The Hammers trailed 3-0 to their bitter rivals in the early stages of the second half, before late goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michail-antonio/"><b>Michail Antonio</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angelo-ogbonna/"><b>Angelo Ogbonna</b></a> made it a nervy finish for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>'s side.</p>
      <p>However, despite showing some fight in the latter stages, Keane has claimed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/manuel-pellegrini/"><b>Manuel Pellegrini</b></a>'s side were "absolute rubbish" in the London derby, insisting that it was "an easy day for Tottenham".</p>
      <p>"They were rubbish, absolute rubbish, absolute disgrace. It was an easy day for Tottenham," Keane told <i>Sky Sports News</i> when questioned ahead of Manchester City's clash with Chelsea.</p>
      <p>West Ham have now lost each of their last three Premier League matches, while they have not been victorious in the top flight since a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/result/result-west-ham-overcome-awful-man-united-at-london-stadium_372421.html">2-0 success</a> over Manchester United on September 22.</p>
      <p>Next up for the London club, who sit 16th in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">the table</a>, is a trip to Chelsea next weekend, before starting the month of December with clashes against Wolverhampton Wanderers and Arsenal.</p>
