      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has been in the jungle for almost a week and let’s face it she’s definitely not afraid to muck in with the bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>But on Saturday night, the 70-year-old almost got defeated by a cow’s eye after she had to eat one in a gruesome bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>As she gagged and retched, the former athlete struggled to swallow the eye.</p>
      <p>For the first time tonight, the main camp and the jungle jailhouse camp came together to take part in a rather gruesome-sounding trial – and t<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/im-celebrity-use-live-bugs-bushtucker-trial-stars-hold-spiders-mouths-despite-controversial-ban-11206966/">hey have to hold live bugs in their mouths for 60 seconds (rather them than us).</a></p>
      <p>One group of campmates had to endure the ‘critter drop’ where they had a selection of creepy crawlies poured all over them.</p>
      <p>The other group has to take part in the ‘hold in mouth trial’.</p>

      <p>‘They are going to take a hold in mouth trial where they have to hold different critters in their mouth for 60 seconds,’ Kate explained Adam Thomas on Extra Camp.</p>

      <p>‘And there’s going to be lots of horrible ones like the Huntsman spider.</p>
      <p>‘The trial will end with them eating a cow’s anus and a cow’s eye.’</p>
      <p>After the trial, Ant and Dec told the celebs that they would then pick names out of the hat – and if they were picked they would have to eat a jungle delicacy.</p>
      <p>First up was James and Caitlyn who each had to eat a cow’s eye.</p>
      <p>James chomped through his with ease earning another star and releasing Myles.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn gagged and retched but ate hers and they had ten stars for camp.</p>
      <p>The next two celebrities had to eat a cow’s anus – and poor Adele Roberts and Nadine Coyle had to do it.</p>
      <p>Nadine and Adele were picked with the pop star going first. She chewed and retched but got it down and Adele asked everyone to sing to encourage her and again ate the cow’s anus meaning between them the campmates won 12 out of 12 stars.</p>
