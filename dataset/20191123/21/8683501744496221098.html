      <p>After the big push for The Snyder Cut <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484985/fans-get-release-the-snyder-cut-trending-on-justice-leagues-2-year-anniversary">on <i>Justice League</i>'s 2-year anniversary</a>, fans are emboldened. Nothing has actually happened yet, but #ReleaseTheSnyderCut went viral in a massive way and now fans are ready to help another DC director. (<i>Fantastic Four</i> director Josh Trank <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484985/fans-get-release-the-snyder-cut-trending-on-justice-leagues-2-year-anniversary">wouldn't mind fans turning his way too</a>.)</p>
      <p>The latest #ReleaseTheLastNameHereCut pitch stems from <i>Suicide Squad</i> director David Ayer's new look at Jared Leto's Joker and Margot Robbie's Harley. It's <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477936/suicide-squad-director-reveals-test-shots-of-joker-and-harley">not the first time</a> he's posted behind-the-scenes looks at the stars in makeup and wardrobe tests. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483240/david-ayer-explains-jared-letos-joker-wardrobe-with-new-white-tuxedo-photo">Each new post</a> feels like a hint to fans, like Ayer is teasing that there's so much more he wanted to show them.</p>

      <p>Well, Harley would always know what time it was, that's for sure. Unless they were all set to the wrong time, which might be classic Harley. At any rate, David Ayer tweeted a link to that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5N3Ocngbn9/?igshid=11e3dtbla7jd1">Instagram</a> post and now his replies on both social media sites are filled with fans willing to go to bat for him to get The Ayer Cut shown:</p>

      <p>Whether <i>Suicide Squad</i> director David Ayer is ready or not, it looks like DC fans are turning his way next:</p>

      <p>David Ayer directed 2016's <i>Suicide Squad</i>, which made $746,846,894 but was not met with a great reception. RT critics have it at 27% with the audience rating it slightly higher at 59%. When the film first came out, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1541209/david-ayer-responds-to-negative-suicide-squad-reviews">Ayer defended it</a>, tweeting a quote that translated to "Iâ€™d prefer to die standing, than to live always on my knees." He said it was "my way of saying I love the movie and believe in it. Made it for the fans. Best experience of my life."</p>
      <p>However, just in September 2019, he reached out with frustration in connection to James Gunn's new movie <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, which is now filming with several <i>Suicide Squad</i> stars -- including Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn but not Jared Leto's Joker.</p>
      <p>David Ayer made it clear he <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2459154/suicide-squad-director-david-ayer-supports-james-gunn-doing-the-sequel">supports James Gunn</a> as <i>The Suicide Squad</i>'s director and he's excited to see the new movie himself. But <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480293/suicide-squad-director-david-ayer-tired-of-being-attacked-film-didnt-match-his-original-vision">he didn't appreciate it</a> when a critic bashed <i>Suicide Squad</i> in relation to the new movie. He said his "frustration comes from being hammered for something that was not my original vision."</p>
      <p>Since David Ayer was willing to speak out about <i>Suicide Squad</i> not matching his original vision, that piqued the interest of some Snyder Cut backers who've been advocating for the release of <i>Justice League</i> director Zack Snyder's full vision.</p>
      <p>On top of that, there's the whole situation with Jared Leto's Joker. Leto was disappointed with the amount of Joker material that was cut from <i>Suicide Squad</i>. David Ayer refuted an <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482693/suicide-squad-director-clears-up-inaccurate-jared-leto-rumor">inaccurate rumor</a> that he was unhappy with Leto's performance and wanted him cut.</p>
      <p>Jared Leto's Joker is <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480285/no-jared-leto-in-the-suicide-squad-cast-dc-fans-have-strong-feelings-about-that">reportedly not in <i>The Suicide Squad</i></a>. He's also certainly not in Joaquin Phoenix's new movie <i>Joker</i>, which has been showered in praise and money. Leto was rumored to have <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482678/did-jared-leto-really-try-to-stop-warner-bros-from-making-joker">tried to stop <i>Joker</i> from being made</a>, since <i>he</i> was the DC's Joker. There was talk of Jared Leto getting his own Joker movie, and enough talk of Joker and Harley getting their own movie that we even <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1695559/the-joker-and-harley-quinn-movie-has-found-its-directors">heard about directors</a> for the project. But that all seems to have changed.</p>
      <p>Now Margot Robbie's Harley has <i>Birds of Prey</i> opening in February 7, 2020 and Joker is moving on without Jared Leto. <i>The Suicide Squad</i> is moving on without David Ayer, who decided to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1683869/why-david-ayer-is-directing-gotham-city-sirens-instead-of-suicide-squad-2">oversee <i>Gotham City Sirens</i></a> instead of <i>Suicide Squad 2</i>. At least <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469920/jared-leto-shares-moving-image-from-morbius">Jared Leto has <i>Morbius</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Maybe we should start thinking about more director's cuts that deserve to be released. Who would you champion? David Ayer? Zack Snyder? Other?</p>
