      <p>A football game between Harvard and Yale was delayed for 45 minutes after climate activists stormed the field and demanded the universities divest from fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred during halftime when people ran into the middle of Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut, and sat in the middle of the field. Others held a large banner that read, “Nobody wins: Yale &amp; Harvard are complicit in climate injustice.”</p>

      <p>Divest Harvard, a campus group advocating for fossil fuel divestment, said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DivestHarvard/status/1198316176688009223">tweet</a> that more than 150 people participated in the protest, which included students, faculty, and alumni.</p>
      <p>Another group, Fossil Free Yale, tweeted, “Wealthy institutions like Yale &amp; Harvard, with endowments totalling $71 billion have no right to profit off the destruction of the planet and land.”</p>

      <p>After about 45 minutes, security and police were able to clear the field of the demonstrators, allowing the famous rivalry game to continue.</p>
      <p>Outspoken actress and activist Alyssa Milano voiced support for the protests over Twitter, writing, "I’m proud to support the students of @DivestHarvard and @FossilFreeYale who disrupted #HarvardYale today to call for fossil fuel divestment. When our richest universities are invested in the destruction of the planet #NobodyWins."</p>
