      <h1>NFL Releases Full List Of Fines, Suspensions For Browns-Steelers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:18:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Earlier today, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph was fined $50,000 for his role in his team’s brawl with the Cleveland Browns. Roughly a few hours later, the NFL released its full list of fines and suspensions from the fight.</p>
      <p>The biggest punishment was handed down to Myles Garrett, who is suspended indefinitely by the NFL. He’ll need to apply for reinstatement in order to play next season.</p>
      <p>Garrett wasn’t the only player suspended by the NFL, as Maurkice Pouncey will miss two games and Larry Ogunjobi will miss one game due to their involvement in the fight.</p>
      <p>As for all the fines, NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero shared the list on Twitter.</p>
      <p>In total there were 33 players that received a fine from the league.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full list:</p>

      <p>Most of the fines on the list registered out at $3,507. The two franchises were also fined $250,000 for the brawl.</p>
      <p>Now that all of this has been handled, the NFL will try to move on from one of the worst brawls in recent memory.</p>
      <p>Although the league obviously wouldn’t want to deal with another situation of this magnitude, they now have a guideline to follow when it comes to punishing players for fights on the field.</p>
