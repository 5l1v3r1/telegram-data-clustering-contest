      <p>As every actor gets cast in a new film, they are often required to learn (or fake really well) new skills.</p>
      <p>A-list stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale aren’t any different and over the years have acquired some very random areas of expertise.</p>
      <p>“I do think the driving skill is very practical,” Bale admitted while talking to <a href="https://people.com/movies/matt-damon-christian-bale-movie-learned-skills-they-use-in-real-life/"><i>People</i></a> about his newest film “Ford v Ferrari”. “I do feel confident, I feel like justifiably, we’ve learned how to put a car through its absolute extremes and paces. It’s not just the speed, but also just testing breaks and really pushing that, and so I do feel good about that.”</p>

      <p>“Fake fighting?” Damon teased.</p>
      <p>“I’ll win any fight as long as I could just miss you by an inch. Right?” Bale quipped back.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, as long as you agree to react to my punches. You can’t just swing at me,” the “Jason Bourne” actor added.</p>
      <p>Other skills Bale has picked up include trick roping.</p>
      <p>“It’s not in use every day, but I can do it a little bit. I learned that a while back. Horseback riding too, with that I could jump on [the horse] backward and whatnot,” the “Batman” star said.</p>
      <p>For Damon, the most useful skill was learning how to play golf which he then got to use while his father was still alive. He recalled, “I learned how to play golf and for the last 20 years of my dad’s life we’d always play a round of golf, just me and him walking around together. That turned into something that was really good.”</p>

      <p>Although it would seem to learn these skills takes a lot longer than it does to forget them.</p>
      <p>“It takes me a long time to learn anything and I forget it incredibly quickly,” Bale mused. “Isn’t that frustrating?” Damon sighed.</p>
      <p>You can catch the two on screen together in “Ford v Ferrari” which is in theatres now.</p>
