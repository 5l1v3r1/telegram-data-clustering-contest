      <p>A NYPD mounted horse is in “stable” condition after being struck by a distracted driver in Manhattan, police said.</p>
      <p>The horse, known as Otis, and his mounted officer were on duty Thursday when they were hit by a driver who couldn’t rein in their vehicle near Central Park, <a href="https://twitter.com/NYPDSpecialops/status/1197967135148036097">NYPD Special Ops tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>Neither Otis nor the cop were injured in the incident, police said.</p>
      <p>Otis will be back in the saddle after a brief break, NYPD’s Special Operations Unit said.</p>
      <p>“As a precaution Otis received a veterinarian exam including X-rays &amp; will remain inside for 5 days to ensure he is healthy,” they wrote. </p>
      <p>A photo taken after the incident showed the patrol pony safe in his stall.</p>
