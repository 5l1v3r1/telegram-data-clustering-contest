      <h1>JK Dobbins Has Message For Ohio State Fans After Win vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:13:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>J.K. Dobbins had quite a final home game for the 2019 Ohio State football regular season today. The Buckeyes’ running back was dominant against Penn State.</p>
      <p>The junior star totaled 157 yards on 36 carries, scoring two touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Dobbins has been sensational all season long and might be in the Heisman Trophy race if not for the dominant performances of Joe Burrow and his teammate, Justin Fields.</p>
      <p>Ohio State fans will certainly take what they’ve gotten from the junior running back so far this season, though.</p>
      <p>Dobbins had a message for those Ohio State fans after the game:</p>

      <p>Dobbins and the Buckeyes will look to end the regular season with a win over Michigan in Ann Arbor next Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for the game between Ohio State and Michigan is set for noon E.T.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
