      <p>For the first time, a Telugu actress has got a full-fledged role in a feature film and that film turned out to be a disappointment for her. ‘<a href="https://www.mirchi9.com/reviews/ragala-24-gantallo-movie-review/">Raagala 24 Gantallo</a>‘ opened to mixed talk from all over, both reviews and word of mouth.</p>
      <p>It’s very rare that a Telugu girl gets a female-oriented movie, but ‘Raagala 24 Gantallo’ didn’t actually give her a role that would be remembered for her performance as her character was poorly etched.</p>
      <p>Though Eesha was true to her character, there isn’t much to make the role memorable from her side. So, the only chance that seemed to be a hope for the Telugu girl has turned out to be disappointing with poor talk.</p>
      <p>She laid a lot of hopes on this film and if the movie was good enough, maybe, Eesha Rebba would have had a boost up in her career. Hmm!</p>
