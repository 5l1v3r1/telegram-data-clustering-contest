      <p><b>ST. SIMONS ISLAND, Ga.Â (AP)</b> - Brendon Todd made six birdies on the front nine to seize control and shot 8-under 62 on Saturday at Sea Island to take a two-shot lead into the final round of the RSM Classic as he goes for his third straight PGA Tour victory.</p>
      <p>Todd, who overcame a case of the full yips that nearly drove him from the game, is coming off victories in the inaugural Bermuda Championship and the Mayakoba Golf Classic.</p>
      <p>He was at 18-under 194, two shots ahead of Webb Simpson (63) and Sebastian Munoz (66).</p>
      <p>Tyler Duncan, who started with a two-shot lead, made 18 pars for a 70 and fell four shots behind.</p>
      <p>Todd is trying to become the first player since Dustin Johnson in 2017 to win three consecutive starts.</p>
