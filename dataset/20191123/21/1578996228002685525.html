      <p>Kate Middleton and Prince William are parents of three children, two of whom attend school. And like any parents protective of their kids who are out in the world, Kate and William are looking out for the best interest of their 4-year-old daughter, Charlotte. <a href="https://people.com/royals/kate-middleton-prince-william-radio-host-greg-james-talk-princess-charlottes-first-day-school/">According to BBC1's Greg James</a>, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had a word with him after they heard him criticize their daughter on his show, Breakfast with Greg James.</p>
      <p>In September, Charlotte started her first day at Thomas's Battersea, where her older brother, George, also attends school. As she held on to her mother's hand with both her small toddler hands, Charlotte is seen on video approaching her teacher. Then, she reaches out her hand and shakes hands politely with the teacher.</p>

      <p>Later, on his radio show, BBC1's Greg James poked fun at the young princess for being so formal.</p>
      <p>James later <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/radio-1s-greg-james-told-20917937">told </a><i><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/radio-1s-greg-james-told-20917937">The Mirror</a></i> that at an event at Kensington Palace, the couple approached James about what he said.</p>
      <p>“They said: ‘We were listening on the morning of little Charlotte’s first day, and we want to talk to you about the handshaking thing,'” James revealed of the meeting. “I went: ‘Oh God, no!'”</p>
      <p>"They’d heard me saying, 'This school was so posh they had to shake hands with their teacher every day. They were not like that in my day. You were pleased if you got a smile,'"</p>
      <p>He did not reveal any more from the conversation but said that he thought his relationship with the duke and duchess was "absolutely fine" now.</p>
