      <p>Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola fears Sergio Aguero has suffered a "bad" injury, which could keep him out for some time.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was forced off in the 77th minute of Manchester City's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> at the Etihad on Saturday and replaced by Brazilian forward Gabriel Jesus.</p>
      <p>"Sergio will be bad, I think. Tomorrow we will know it. The feeling is it's muscular," said Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Aguero wasn't the only City star to make way because of injury.</p>
      <p>Both David Silva, playing in his final season for the Citizens, and summer signing Rodri were replaced by Phil Foden and Ilkay Gundogan respectively.</p>

      <p>But Guardiola isn't concerned about his two midfielders, explaining they were taken off because they're not match-fit, and not because they picked up serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Guardiola added: "Rodri and David had problems with cramp and being tired; Rodri one and a half months without playing games, David needs rhythm and these games are so demanding."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> went behind against Frank Lampard's Blues when N'Golo Kante slotted past Ederson after getting the better of Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>But Kevin de Bruyne leveled the scores with a deflected effort before Riyad Mahrez produced a moment of magic to beat two Chelsea defenders and fire City ahead.</p>
