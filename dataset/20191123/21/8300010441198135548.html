      <p>LOS ANGELES -- California is increasing business tax rates on legal marijuana, a move that stunned struggling companies that have been pleading with the state to do just the opposite.<br/><br/>Hefty marijuana taxes that can approach 50 percent in some communities have been blamed for pushing shoppers into California's tax-free illegal market, which is thriving. Industry analysts estimate that $3 are spent in the illegal market for every $1 in the legal one.<br/><br/>The California Cannabis Industry Association said in a statement that its members are "stunned and outraged."<br/><br/>The group said the higher taxes that will take effect Jan. 1 will make it even worse for a legal industry struggling under the weight of heavy regulation and fees, local bans on pot sales and growing and a booming underground marketplace.<br/><br/>"Widening the price ... gap between illicit and regulated products will further drive consumers to the illicit market at a time when illicit products are demonstrably putting people's lives at risk," the group said, referring to the national vaping health crisis.<br/><br/>Los Angeles dispensary owner Jerred Kiloh, who heads the United Cannabis Business Association, said the increased levies added to the heavily taxed market "seems like a slap in the face."<br/><br/>The changes involve taxes paid by legal businesses, which ultimately get passed along to consumers at the retail counter.<br/><br/>Josh Drayton of the cannabis association predicted that an eighth-ounce purchase of marijuana buds, typically priced around $40 to $45, would be pushed up to $50 or more in the new year.<br/><br/>For consumers, "ultimately, they'll feel that at the register," Drayton said.<br/><br/>A major change involves what's known as the mark-up rate, which is used when calculating taxes in certain business transactions, such as when a retailer purchases wholesale cannabis that will in turn be sold to consumers. The mark-up rate is being pushed up over 30 percent from its current mark.<br/><br/>Casey Wells, a spokesman for the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, said in a statement that the new rate was determined after the agency analyzed thousands of transactions in California's computerized marijuana-tracking system.<br/><br/>Separately, cultivation tax rates are being increased by inflation, as required by law. For example, the tax on an ounce of dry buds will climb to $9.65 from $9.25, an increase of just over 4 percent.<br/><br/>Last week, the state's top cannabis regulator, Lori Ajax, told an industry conference that the legal marketplace can expect more strain and turbulence for at least a couple of years as it deals with sustained competition from illegal sales, industry layoffs and fallout from a national vaping crisis.<br/><br/>California Assemblyman Rob Bonta said in a statement that the state should be cutting marijuana taxes to encourage more businesses to move into the regulated market.<br/><br/>"This short-sighted move ignores the realities that licensed businesses are at the breaking point, with many struggling to survive," the Oakland Democrat said.</p>
