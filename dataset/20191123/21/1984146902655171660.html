      <p>X Factor Celebrity contestant Vinnie Jones has been blasted by viewers of the show for his version of a Dirty Dancing classic.</p>
      <p>Former Wimbledon footballer Vinnie was at the centre of controversy last week after judge Simon Cowell ignored his wishes to bow out from the singing contest gracefully and instead sent home Glee star Kevin McHale, much to the anger of fans of the show.</p>
      <p>And on Saturday night, Vinnie had everyone talking again for all the wrong reasons after he sang (I've Had) The Time of My Life in a bid to make next weekend's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> final.</p>
      <p>In the VT prior to his performance, Vinnie said the track was one of his late wife Tanya's all time favourites, but as soon as the song started, those watching at home were turned off by his version of the 80s movie anthem, <i><b>which you can watch in the footage above taken from ITV.</b></i></p>
      <p>One unhappy viewer reacted "Vinnie Jones murdered and butchered a classic dirty dancing movie soundtrack f****** shocking," and, echoing those sentiments, another posted "Who sat and planned this Vinnie Jones performance and thought it would be a good idea?"</p>
      <p>Sticking the knife in further, another viewer tweeted " Vinnie Jones 'I can’t believe I’m in the semi final'. Neither can we," and looking back to last week's drama, another ranted "Vinnie Jones had the chance to leave the show there with the highest dignity, but as far as I’m concerned, Simon Cowell has just taken that all away from him at the expense of Kevin. This series has been an absolute s*** show from start to finish.</p>
      <p>The result of Saturday night's show brought bad news for Vinnie as he was booted out of the competition after finishing bottom of the public vote.</p>
