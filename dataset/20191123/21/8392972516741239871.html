      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">The X Factor: Celebrity</a> are calling for boss Simon Cowell to be 'banned from TV' following comments he made about Vinnie Jones' performance.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood star, 54, put on a well and truly explosive show during the penultimate episode of the series on Saturday night (23.11.19).</p>
      <p>He pranced around the stage with a crowd as he shouted an alternative version of (I've Had) The Time Of My Life from the film Dirty Dancing.</p>

      <p>Viewers thought it was visually and audibly staggering, with many on Twitter branding his performance an "assault" on the ears and others admitting they wanted to get away from their TVs.</p>
      <p>One said: "This #XFactor is a heinous assault on my ears. That was not the time of my life. #CelebrityXFactor."</p>
      <aside>Ban Simon Cowell from TV.</aside>
      <p>Another wrote: "From the second Vinnie Jones starts singing I have a sudden urge to go for a long drive #celebrityxfactor."</p>
      <p>A third said: "Vinnie Jones needs to go... hasn't a note in his head."</p>

      <p>But when it was time for Simon Cowell, Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh to comment, they seemed to like it.</p>
      <p>And Simon was particularly positive in his comments, telling Vinnie: "Like every great sportsman, when you're in the bottom and you come back the following week... you came back with confidence!</p>
      <p>"You haven't compromised yourself at any time.</p>
      <p>"I did feel, when you were singing the lyrics, it was almost like a goodbye song, but I have a feeling that it might not be a goodbye song for you."</p>

      <p>Some viewers questioned Simon's ability to judge a singing competition and called for him to be banned from making any more TV shows.</p>
      <p>"Simon Cowell needs to be banned from making TV shows," said one, adding: "Jesus #celebrityxfactor."</p>
      <p>"Omg that was dreadful, someone kick Cowell in to space #celebrityxfactor," tweeted another.</p>
      <p>Someone else wrote: "[Bleep] this program, ban Simon Cowell from TV. #celebrityXFactor."</p>
