      </p>
      <p>Luis Ortiz put Deontay Wilder through a seventh round of hell in what some people thought was enough to earn a stoppage victory in their March 2018 fight. However, the referee allowed the bout to continue and "The Bronze Bomber" rallied for a spectacular 10th-round TKO to defend his WBC world heavyweight title.</p>

      <p>Now, Wilder looks to clear any lingeringdoubt that he's the superior fighter whenhe puts his WBC strap on the line against Ortiz once again. The <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/boxing/news/deontay-wilder-2019-fight-anthony-joshua-announcing-luis-ortiz-rematch/hs9pnc68gq731gbrusj9uagch">highly-anticipated rematch</a> takes place Saturday night on pay-per-view live from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>"Most of the times when you win, especially when you knock him out, other guys are willing to fight him.They see weaknesses. They see kinks in his armor. But Ortiz's situation in this case, none of these guys still they didn't want to fight him then and they don't want to fight him now," Wilder told Sporting News as part of a conference call about the fight last week. "So, I wanted to give him an opportunity again to prove all doubt about our first fight that we had."</p>
      <p>Ortiz, is coming off a unanimous decision victory over Christian Hammerin March, will look for the win that just eluded him in the original bout with Wilder.</p>
      <p>"As soon as I made the connection and hurt him and I saw him where he was and I knew I was going to finish him and that the fight was over basically," Ortiz said, referring to the pressure he applied to Wilder in that seventh round. "I haven't had any other situation like that where I hadn't gotten a knockout in a scenario like that. So it's just a matter of putting some punches together and winning this fight."</p>
