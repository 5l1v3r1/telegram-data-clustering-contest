        <b>Draws are strange in rugby but when it comes to the European stage, it’s imperative that you win your home games to give yourself the best opportunity of getting through to the knockout stages.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this case, it’s difficult to know how Munster are feeling. They looked down and out for long periods of the second half but a try from Andrew Conway and a sublime conversion from JJ Hanrahan saw Munster snatch a draw from the jaws of defeat.</p>
      <p>It could have been a whole lot better if Hanrahan nailed the last-gasp drop-goal attempt but it wasn’t to be.</p>
      <p>So Munster now face into a familiar scenario. The 2017/18 and 2018/19 campaigns saw them record one draw in the opening two games. However, they were both away from home.</p>

      <p>With Saracens picking up a bonus-point victory against the Ospreys this weekend, it looks like the English champions may take this competition seriously despite their precarious position in the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>Summing up the performance, Munster captain Peter O’Mahony struggled to explain whether his side are happy with the result or not.</p>
      <p>“Look, it’s kinda hard to say,” O’Mahony said post-match.</p>
      <p>“Around 50 minutes we shouldn’t have been next to or near a draw and then with 10 minutes to go, we could have won it. I don’t think we played well enough to win the game, to be totally honest with you. We played some very good rugby but some mental lapses defensively cost you against teams like that.</p>
      <p>“I thought they played really well and we played some really good rugby as well but overall, it probably flattered us a bit getting the draw with the way they played and the overall way we played. That would be my gut feeling.”</p>

      <p>There were so many subplots to tonight’s fixture, none so more than the return of Simon Zebo and Donnacha Ryan to Thomond Park for the first time since their respective moves to the French capital.</p>
      <p>“It’s just another team, you know what I mean? It’s good to have them home but they’re not in the right colour jersey, unfortunately, so they’re just another opposition player when you’re out there.”</p>
      <p>Another significant feature was Alby Mathewson lining out for Munster for the last time and O’Mahony paid tribute to the former All Black who has certainly had a huge impact on the club.</p>
      <blockquote>“He has contributed from the moment he arrived to his last game. I spoke about him inside, he was a standard-setter from the minute he arrived, training-wise, competitive-wise. He’s a good guy to have around the squad, good around young fellas, good to sit and have a chat with, just a good person.</blockquote>
      <p>“He fitted in incredibly well and we’re very grateful for his effort and we’ll be sad to see him go. I was chatting to the lads last night, you’ll miss him around, he’s good craic.”</p>
