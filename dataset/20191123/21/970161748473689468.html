      <p>Coronation Street’s Helen Flanagan has shut down a troll after they accused her of ‘moaning’ about her kids.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old, who has recently confirmed her return to the soap, shares two daughters Matilda, four, and one-year-old Delilah with fiancé Scott Sinclair.</p>
      <p>And while she keeps her fans updated on their milestones, the proud mum is also known for keeping things real.</p>
      <p>Most recently, the star revealed she was struggling to find some downtime and needed to take a tactical toilet break in order to catch her breath.</p>
      <p>Sharing a picture of herself in the bathroom, the Rosie Webster star said: ‘To get an peace at the moment I have to lock myself in the toilet… any other mums do the same?</p>

      <p>‘Delilah screamed so much in the car today I was so stressed I had to stop at Costa drive thru and inhale this.’</p>

      <p>But it seems not all of her followers liked the post, as she later revealed a message she was sent by an angry fan.</p>
      <p>‘Stop ranting about ur kids!’ the DM read: ‘Buckle up and get on with it!!! There are some people who are unable to conceive then u have people like urself moaning!’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘It’s part of the process get on with it and stop RANTING! Which is what your doing.’</p>

      <p>But the actress was not staying quiet as she politely hit back at their response.</p>
      <p>‘Actually. I am honest on my Instagram so other mums can identify with me and feel less on their own,’ she said before continuing: ‘I am supportive of other women.’</p>
      <p>She added to the post: ‘Direct messages like this. I have friends very close to me who have struggled to conceive.’</p>
      <p>But despite her hectic family life, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/08/coronation-streets-helen-flanagan-confirms-plans-return-rosie-webster-9443217/">the star will be making her way back to the soap in the near future.</a></p>
      <p>Confirming the news on Lorraine, she said: ‘I miss Coronation Street so much and I’m definitely going to go back, definitely.</p>
      <p>‘It’s just working it around my girls. Matilda’s at the age now where she’s four and she needs to be taken to all of her lessons. Obviously with me living in Scotland it’s a four-hour drive and Delilah’s nearly one.’</p>
      <p>‘I just love it so much,’ Helen added as she continued to enthusiastically talk about the soap. ‘I’ve been there since I was nine.’</p>
