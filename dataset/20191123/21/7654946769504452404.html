      <p>New York’s Fighting Irish are making a new splash — on the rocks.</p>
      <p>A non-profit historical trust dedicated to the famed 69th Infantry Regiment debuted its own authentic Irish Whiskey this week in bars and liquor stores across the Big Apple.</p>
      <p>“The Fighting 69th” firewater was the brainchild of Col. James Tierney, a retired regiment officer who spent a decade as the unit’s historian.</p>
      <p>“My father was in the 69th, my two uncles were in the 69th and I grew up with the 69th,” Tierney, 74, told The Post.</p>
      <p>He expects the new spirit will make the official regimental cocktail — whiskey and Champagne — go down even smoother.</p>
      <p>New York City’s 69th was formed in 1849 by Irish nationalists who fled their homeland after participating in a failed rebellion against British rule during the height of the potato famine. It was christened the “Fighting 69th” during the Civil War by none other than Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who saw the New Yorkers rout his own ferocious “Louisiana Tigers” during the battle of Malvern Hill in 1862. At Gettysburg, its soldiers fought valiantly in “the wheatfield” despite being vastly outnumbered.</p>
      <p>Joyce Kilmer wrote a poem about what became known as the “Fighting Irish” and Jimmy Cagney immortalized them in the 1940 flick <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032467/">“The Fighting 69th.”</a> Times Square’s “Duffy Square” is named for the unit’s WWI chaplain, Father Francis P. Duffy.</p>

      <p>The unit later fought in both world wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, and seven of its members have been awarded the Medal of Honor. It is now part of the New York Army National Guard.</p>
      <p>The idea for the whiskey was born eight years ago when Tierney and his comrades attended Ireland’s annual Tricolour Celebration honoring the nation’s flag.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘I’m going to check with a couple of distilleries in Ireland and see if they would be interested in just putting our label on a couple of bottles,'” Tierney recalled. “In Ireland they thought it was a great idea.”</p>
      <p>The project stalled until a chance meeting between Tierney and a liquor distributor who was touring the regiment’s headquarters, an imposing Beaux-Arts armory at 68 Lexington Ave. in Flatiron.</p>
      <p>About 18 months later, The Espiritus Group is bringing the $35 whiskey — sourced and aged along the southern Irish coast — to market.</p>
      <p>The bottle itself offers homage to the regiment’s history, listing historic battles and the unit’s cheeky motto: “Gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked.”</p>
      <p>A dollar from every sale will also go to benefit the 69th Regiment’s historical trust, Scott Reid, Espiritus’ chief marketing officer, said.</p>
