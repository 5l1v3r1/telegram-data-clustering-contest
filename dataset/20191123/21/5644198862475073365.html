      <p>LOS ANGELES: Kawhi Leonard nailed the go-ahead basket with just 15 seconds remaining to lift the Los Angeles Clippers to an entertaining 122-119 win over the Houston Rockets on Friday night (Nov 22).</p>
      <p>Leonard finished with 24 points and six rebounds, while Paul George had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Clippers, who won their fourth consecutive game.</p>

      <p>"It feels great. We are trying to build something," Leonard said. "We made a few little mistakes in the first half, but we ended up closing it out in the fourth though.</p>
      <p>"We are building. This is just our second game with everyone playing again and it has just been great."</p>
      <p>Clippers' Lou Williams scored all 26 of his points in the second half in front of a crowd of 19,000 at Staples Center arena.</p>
      <p>James Harden had 37 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds for the Rockets, who have lost their last two games after going on an eight-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>Williams gave the Clippers a 118-117 lead with 30 seconds remaining by draining a three point shot. Harden then made two free throws to restore Houston's lead, 119-118, with 22 seconds to go.</p>
      <p>After Leonard's bucket, George helped clinch it by making two free throws with one second on the clock.</p>
      <p>It was the first meeting between Houston's Russell Westbrook and George. They played two seasons together with the Oklahoma City Thunder before George left to join the Clippers.</p>
      <p>The Thunder dealt Westbrook to the Rockets a short time later.</p>
      <p>Westbrook scored 22 points but he missed a three point attempt late in the game which would have given the Rockets a shot at victory.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, LeBron James had 23 points and Anthony Davis made four clutch free throws in the final ten seconds as the Los Angeles Lakers pulled out a 130-127 win over the Oklahoma City on Friday.</p>
      <p>Davis finished with a team-high 33 points and 11 rebounds, but it was his free throw shooting that helped the Lakers seal the victory over the struggling Thunder.</p>
      <p>Chris Paul made a layup with 11 seconds remaining to get the Thunder to within 126-125 before Davis made a pair of free throws to put the Lakers up by three with eight seconds left.</p>
      <p>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored with four seconds to go before two more free throws from Davis gave the Lakers another three-point cushion. The Thunder made a final long desperation inbounds pass, but James stole the ball from Steven Adams to end the game.</p>
      <p>"We find a way to win no matter what the game is," said James. "This is a very good team at home. They've struggled on the road a little bit, but we knew they were going to give it their best punch."</p>
      <p>This marked the Lakers' second win over the Thunder in a span of three days, after beating Oklahoma City 112-107 on Tuesday at Los Angeles. The Thunder have now lost three straight and five of their last six.</p>
      <p>The Lakers won their sixth straight game and earned a 13th victory in their past 14 contests.</p>
      <p>It is the seventh consecutive game that James has posted double-digit assists. He leads the league with an average of 11.3 assists per game.</p>
      <p>Gilgeous-Alexander scored 24 points and Adams added 22 for the Thunder.</p>
      <p>Paul added 18 points and seven assists for Oklahoma City, which tied a season-high in points.</p>
      <p>Lakers guard Rajon Rondo was ejected with 10:20 remaining when he earned his second technical for a flagrant foul for putting his right leg into the groin area of Thunder guard Dennis Schroder.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DONCIC DOMINATES</b>
      </p>
      <p>Also, Luka Doncic posted his third straight 30-plus point game as the Dallas Mavericks swept all four games on their recent homestand with a 143-101 rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
      <p>Doncic, who rested on the bench for the entire fourth quarter, finished with 30 points and 14 assists on 11 of 18 shooting from the floor.</p>
      <p>He is the eighth Mavericks player to score 30-plus points in three straight games, joining among others Dirk Nowitzki who did it in 2010.</p>
      <p>Nowitzki was watching from the stands on Friday night. It was his first visit to American Airlines Center since retiring after last season.</p>
      <p>Justin Jackson had 19 points, Kristaps Porzingis scored 17, and Tim Hardaway had 16 for Dallas, who had seven players finish in double-digit scoring.</p>
      <p>Darius Garland scored 23 points for Cleveland, who have lost six in a row.</p>
