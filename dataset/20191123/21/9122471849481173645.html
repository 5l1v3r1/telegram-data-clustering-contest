      <h1>Nick Saban Reacts To Mac Jones’ Performance vs. Western Carolina</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:21:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa’s unfortunate season-ending injury last week against Mississippi State has opened the door for Alabama QB Mac Jones. The quarterback got his first start under center on Saturday against Western Carolina.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide QB was nearly perfect, going 10-of-12 for 275 yards and three touchdowns. It was certainly an impressive start for the young quarterback.</p>
      <p>Alabama head coach Nick Saban discussed Jones’ performance after the Crimson Tide’s 66-3 victory on Saturday. Saban kept his comments brief.</p>
      <blockquote>“Mac was efficient.” Saban said, via <a href="https://twitter.com/mikerodak/status/1198333795763720192">Mike Rodak of AL.com</a>. “Made a lot of explosive plays. Maybe didn’t throw it as much.”</blockquote>

      <p>Jones and the Crimson Tide are trying to do all they can to impress the College Football Playoff committee. Today’s victory won’t move the needle in regards to where Alabama should be ranked. But next’s week Iron Bowl will be pivotal.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide have one last shot to try and convince the committee they should be one of the four teams in the playoff. Many experts feel because of Tagovailoa’s injury, the Tide don’t deserve a top-four ranking. But Jones will certainly try and prove the committee wrong.</p>
      <p>If Alabama can come away with a convincing win over Auburn next week, that might be enough to earn a spot in the CFP.</p>
      <p>Alabama-Auburn kicks off next Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS.</p>
