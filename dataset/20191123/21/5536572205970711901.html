      <h1>Cam Newton To Serve Thanksgiving Meals To 1,300 Underprivileged Children in Charlotte</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:58:49+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:58</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Cam Newton is helping children in need as Thanksgiving gets closer. The Carolina Panthers quarterback will be serving Thanksgiving meals to 1,300 underprivileged children in the Charlotte area according to the Charlotte Observer.</p>
      <p>If you’ve been following his career, then you’d know he’s been doing this for years, as he dished out meals to <a href="https://www.totalprosports.com/2018/11/15/cam-newton-buying-thanksgiving-meals-for-1200-underprivileged-kids/">1,200 kids</a> in 2018, <a href="https://www.totalprosports.com/2016/11/16/cam-newton-throwing-massive-thanksgiving-for-800-underprivileged-kids-their-families-video/">800</a> in 2016, and<a href="https://www.totalprosports.com/2015/11/24/cam-newton-hosts-thanksgiving-dinner-for-900-needy-kids/"> 900</a> in 2015.</p>
      <p>Newton confirmed the event on his Twitter, writing, “Throwback Thursday to Cam’s Thanksgiving Jam through the years! Looking forward to our BIGGEST Thanksgiving Jam yet. It’s coming next week with the help of our partners [Chase] and [Harris Teeter].”</p>

      <p>This will be his foundation’s eighth annual “Cam’s Thanksgiving Jam” with some of his family members and about 80 volunteers.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 5, the Panthers placed Newton on injured reserve, ending his injury-wracked season, but talk of his departure from the franchise has died down a bit after backup QB Kyle Allen started playing badly over the past few games, with the team losing 3 out of the last 4 games.</p>
      <p>The team could save $19.1 million by trading or releasing him, but they have not made that decision as of yet, which likely won’t come into the offseason.</p>
      <p>Newton has been with the team since 2011 and he won the MVP award in 2015.</p>
