      <p>Daniel Craig, 51-year-old actor and longstanding James Bond, has confirmed that the next film, "No Time to Die," will be his last.</p>
      <p>"I've had a really good run, and I think doing this movie was the right thing to do," Craig tells USA TODAY. "It was the right thing to do one more."</p>
      <p>Craig, who appears in the murder mystery "Knives Out" (in theaters Friday) also starred in four other Bond films spanning more than a decade starting with "Casino Royale" in 2006. He portrayed James Bond in "Quantum of Solace" in 2008, "Skyfall" in 2012 and "Spectre" in 2015. "No Time to Die" will be his fifth adventure as Bond.</p>
      <p>"No Time to Die," which is set to hit the big screen in the U.S. on April, has cast Lashana Lynch as a "female version" according to the Independent.</p>
