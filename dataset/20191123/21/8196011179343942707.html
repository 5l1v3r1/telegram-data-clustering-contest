      <p>Eire Og (Carlow) 2-11 - 1-6 Portlaoise (Laois)</p>
      <p>A week after their hurling champions surged through to the AIB Leinster club final, Carlow's football representatives Eire Og did likewise in their code with a display of high quality in Portlaoise.</p>
      <p>Level at half-time against joint record title holders Portlaoise - and playing in Portlaoise's backyard at MW Hire O'Moore Park - the underdogs roared to a famous win, outscoring the hosts 1-6 to 0-1 in the second-half.</p>
      <p>A bad evening for Portlaoise, who didn't score from play in that second-half, ended with 53rd and 62nd minute dismissals for Kieran Lillis and Conor Boyle.</p>
      <p>It's a case of back to the future for Eire Og who won five Leinster titles in the 1990s, dominating the provincial scene between 1992 and 1998.</p>
      <p>The current team have a bit to go to equal those achievements but this was a huge win all the same, coming after a surprise quarter-final defeat of Kildare's Sarsfields.</p>
      <p>Bar a 10-minute in the lead up to half-time when Portlaoise were on top, it was all Eire Og who turned in an expert display of counter attacking football.</p>
      <p>Chris Blake was their lead marksman and he fired 1-4, 1-3 of which came from play, while Niall Quinlan scored three important points from frees after his half-time introduction.</p>
      <p>Eire Og came armed with confidence and momentum and surged 1-3 to 0-1 ahead after just 15 minutes with Blake hitting the net inside the opening 60 seconds.</p>

      <p>Portlaoise, who beat St Pat's of Wicklow on penalties to reach the last four, fought back to level terms by the 19th minute thanks in part to a Lillis goal.</p>
      <p>The sides were deadlocked at 1-5 apiece at the break though Eire Og had failed to convert a 26th minute penalty and proceeded to dominate the second-half.</p>
      <p>They scored the first three points of the second period and were always in control while Portlaoise, in contrast, racked up the wides and could only muster a Brian McCormack point from a free.</p>
      <p>Lillis walked for his second yellow card in the closing minutes and Boyle's frustrations got the better of him too in stoppage time.</p>
