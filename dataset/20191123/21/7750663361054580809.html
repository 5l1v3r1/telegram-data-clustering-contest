      <p>The 19-year-old joined Barca from Toulouse in January 2019 but has struggled to make his mark for the Catalan giants, appearing on just four occasions since arriving in Spain.</p>
      <p>The defender has not even made the squad for his team's last two matches, while his last La Liga appearance came against Sevilla towards the start of October.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Sport</i>, a selection of Premier League sides have contacted Barca to determine whether the teenager will be available for transfer during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>However, it is alleged that the Spanish champions still have faith in the France Under-20 international and are reluctant to lose a player in an area where they are currently struggling for numbers.</p>
      <p>Barca were without four defenders - <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergi-roberto/"><b>Sergi Roberto</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nelson-semedo/"><b>Nelson Semedo</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/clement-lenglet/"><b>Clement Lenglet</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jordi-alba/"><b>Jordi Alba</b></a> - for Saturday's clash with Leganes but head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ernesto-valverde/"><b>Ernesto Valverde</b></a> could still not find a spot in his squad for Todibo.</p>
