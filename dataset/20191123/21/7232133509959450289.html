      <h1>Bitcoin’s Macro Outlook is Insanely Bullish, But BTC May First Visit Sub-$5,000</h1>

      <p>Bitcoin has been facing intense volatility over the past month, which first began when it incurred an explosive rally that sent it from $7,300 to highs of $10,600. In the time since this occurred, BTC’s bears have been firmly in control, erasing nearly all of the gains that were produced in this rally.</p>
      <p>In the short-term, analysts are noting that it seems nearly inevitable that BTC will dip below $5,000, but the long-term outlook still looks incredibly bullish, with one industry insider saying it is all but guaranteed that Bitcoin will eventually see $100,000.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Finds Support at $6,700, But Sub-$5,000 Movement May be Inbound</h3>
      <p>Currently, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/18/bitcoin-price-falls-to-8000-as-bulls-fail-to-step-in/">Bitcoin</a> is trading up just under 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $7,300, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of $6,700 that were set during the recent sell-off.</p>
      <p>BTC’s strong bounce from these lows signals that there is a significant amount of buying pressure here, which may bolster its near-term price action.</p>
      <p>Despite this, analysts still believe that a sub-$5,000 movement is imminent, which would cause Bitcoin to drop towards its 2018 and 2019 lows that sit within the lower-$3,000 region.</p>
      <p>Harry, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, telling his followers that he is current watching for a break below BTC’s near-term support, which he believes will lead it to plummet below $5,000.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC – an update on the longer term view for BTC, price action suggests that the dip below $5k is inevitable now, so many good short selling spots along the way,” he explained</blockquote>

      <h3>Cardano Founder: BTC Will Trade Above $100k Eventually</h3>
      <p>Although the near-term outlook for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/01/18/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-volumes-shrink-22-from-jan-10/">Bitcoin</a> may seem gloomy, the macro outlook still looks insanely bullish.</p>
      <p>Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano (ADA) explained in a recent tweet that the global movement that is backing Bitcoin’s ascension will be what propels its price past $10,000 and eventually what allows it to surge to $100,000.</p>
      <blockquote>“Bitcoin’s price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that’s going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future,” he bullishly explained in a tweet.</blockquote>

      <p>The coming few months may elucidate whether or not <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/analyst-break-below-bitcoins-current-support-could-spark-drop-to-6000/">Bitcoin</a> will truly retrace back down towards its yearly lows, but the long-term outlook still favors bulls.</p>
