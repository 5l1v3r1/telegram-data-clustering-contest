      <h1>Sunday Talk Shows: After two weeks of testimony, lawmakers look to next steps of impeachment proceedings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:53:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>As House Democrats eye their next steps in the impeachment hearing into <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> following two weeks of public testimony, Intelligence Committee Democrats are slated to make the talk show rounds this Sunday. </p>
      <p>Panel Chairman <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.) has said that lawmakers will decide what's next on the docket <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471719-democrats-set-to-open-new-chapter-in-impeachment">“in the coming days”</a> following the ending of the hearings, which have captured the news cycle. At this moment, it is <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471744-trump-gop-skeptical-pelosi-will-go-through-with-impeachment">still unknown</a> whether or not the House will vote on articles of impeachment and how many articles there will be. Though it is unlikely that House Democrats will back away from this critical step of impeachment proceedings now. </p>
      <p>Schiff himself will appear on both NBC’s “Meet the Press” and CNN's "State of the Union" this Sunday, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/5d218235058a446aa1a76f8cf49bf687">The Associated Press</a>. </p>
      <p>Fellow Intelligence Committee Democrats <a href="https://thehill.com/people/eric-swalwell">Eric Swalwell</a> (Calif.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jim-himes">Jim Himes</a> (Conn.) will appear on "Fox News Sunday" and CBS’s “Face the Nation” respectively. </p>
      <p>The White House will also have representation on CBS, with counselor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kellyanne-conwaya">Kellyanne Conway</a> scheduled to appear and likely to face questions on the hearings in which witnesses have detailed President Trump's efforts to get Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>. </p>
      <p>Republicans on the other two committees that have been leading the impeachment probe, the Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees, will also appear Sunday. Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/lee-zeldin">Lee Zeldin</a> (R-N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs panel will be on CNN and Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-N.D.) of the Oversight Panel will appear on CBS.</p>
