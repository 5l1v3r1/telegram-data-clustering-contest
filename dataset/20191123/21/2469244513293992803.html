      <p>City skipper Dean Moxey felt that the Grecians were good value for the three points after their 1-0 win away to Crawley Town.</p>
      <p>Moxey, 33, was wearing the armband as club captain Jake Taylor, although back from his suspension, only started on the bench.</p>
      <p>The defender popped up with the winning goal 13 minutes from time to give Matt Taylor’s men the win, as he turned in a Randell Williams corner.</p>
      <p>Speaking after the game, Moxey, said that given the chances created and how they defended, they would have been disappointed not to have won.</p>

      <p>He said: “It is a big result. We said beforehand we wanted to get back to winning games. It was a tough game but we had quite a few chances to put the ball in the net and luckily I us did, so it was a big three points.</p>
      <p>“As a defender it is nice to get the clean sheet and to knick the winning goal as well. We always want the clean sheet and the last few games we have been able to do that, and if you don’t let any goals in and then knick one, then you get the three points.</p>

      <p>“I felt we were good value for the win and had we not won we would have been very disappointed. They had a few chances at the end but didn’t trouble us really.</p>
      <p>“We just keep going to the end. We had a tough pre-season but we are a fit team and we know we can run for 90 minutes plus. If it takes until the 91 minute, then we’ll keep going.”</p>
      <p>The City man also praised the 447 fans who had braved the wet weather to make the long trip to Crawley.</p>
      <p>He said: “We had great support. To travel so far and on a day like this, to see so many City fans begin the goal was special.”</p>
