      <p>A suggestive church stained-glass window that appears to show a well-hung Jesus has found fame online.</p>
      <p>The picture, captured in an unknown location, depicts Mary holding Jesus. The artwork is possibly meant to resemble The Piet√†, a sculpture by Michaelangelo.</p>
      <p>But Twitter users think the stained-glass window actually shows Mary holding Jesus by the penis.</p>

      <p>"Grippin' on tight to the holy spirit," tweeted @MegOnZ92.</p>
      <p>Another person asked, "What, exactly... is Mary holding?"</p>
      <p>And @EAD_SPORTS stated, "I knew Jesus was a ginger."</p>
      <p>This is not the first time a depiction of Jesus has gone wrong.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week a 6.7m-tall statue commissioned by a church in Mexico was said to closely resemble Phil Collins.</p>
      <p>In 2012 an amateur artist famously tried to restore a fresco of Jesus, turning it into what looked more like a monkey than man.</p>
      <p>And in 2016 a baby Jesus statue's head was stolen, and its replacement looked like a terracotta gargoyle.</p>
