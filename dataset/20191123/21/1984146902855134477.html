      <h1>Women take to Newcastle streets to march against sexual harassment</h1>
      <h2>TUC Northern organised the Reclaim the Night march and rally in the city centre</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T21:19:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 21:19</time> by <a rel="author">Kali Lindsay</a></address>
      <p>Armed with drummers, banners and whistles, dozens of women took to the streets of Newcastle as part of a fight to eliminate violence against women.</p>
      <p>TUC Northern held its annual Reclaim the Night march and rally in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">city centre</a> on Saturday night to show all women have the right to use public spaces in daytime and nightmare - without the fear of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>It comes after research by the union in 2016 revealed more than half of working women have experienced sexual harassment at work, with young women and those on zero-hour contracts even more likely to be harassed.</p>

      <p>The march started in Old Eldon Square, proceeded up Northumberland Street and finished at The Sutherland Building on Northumberland Road, where a seminar and speeches took place.</p>
      <p>The event took place on the United Nations' International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.</p>
      <p>Chairwoman of the TUC Northern Women’s Group Pat Heron said: "WE are here to raise awareness of women's safety around the city and we want to work with the police and women's organisations because, as long as women are objectified, we need to take to the streets to try and tackle the issue."</p>
      <p>Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Kim McGuinness, who spoke at the event, said: "There is a real movement to change attitudes and behaviours and this rally is about coming together with an empowering message of solidarity and strength.</p>
      <p>“As the campaign says - we need to end violence once and for all. For me, I want to go right back to the beginning and tackle the issues that lead people to behaving this way – it’s unacceptable and we need to stop it.</p>
      <p>“I also want victims to be aware of the help and support that is available to them throughout our region.</p>
      <p>"This is something I’m building on through commissioned services as part of my Violence Reduction Unit. Nobody should suffer in silence.”</p>
