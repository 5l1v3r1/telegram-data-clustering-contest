      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Real Madrid v Real Sociedad</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 23 November 2019</p>

      <p>Real Madrid will be seeking keep pace with rivals FC Barcelona in LaLiga when they host Real Sociedad on Saturday evening at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>The match is set to start at 22h00.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos have not exactly set the league alight yet but have managed to put a good run of form together just before the FIFA break, where Zinedine Zinedine’s charges thrashed Eibar 4-0 before</p>
      <p>However, Zinedine Zidane does have injury concerns to deal, with Lucas Vazquez, Marco Asensio, Nacho and James Rodriguez all ruled out of the clash.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the Basque outfit have won three of their last five league matches and will be confident of causing an upset, with only two points separating them with Los Blancos and first-placed Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Sociedad missed the chance to go level on points with both Barça and Madrid after they were held to a 1-1 draw by Leganes before the international break.</p>
      <p>In their duels last term, Sociedad completed a league double over Los Blancos, after winning 2-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu and 3-1 on their home turf.</p>
      <p><b>Here's how they line up:</b><br/><br/><b>Real Madrid: </b>Courtois; Carvajal, Varane, Sergio Ramos, Mendy; Casemiro, Fede Valverde, Modrić; Rodrygo, Benzema, Hazard.</p>
      <p><b>Real Sociedad: </b>Remiro; Zaldúa, Elustondo, Diego Llorente, Monreal; Zubeldia, Merino, Odegaard; Portu, Oyarzabal, Willian José.</p>
