          <p>Arsenal is slowly moving away from the desired targets of the season with the underwhelming performances in last few matches. Once again, things did not get better for Unai Emery as they played a draw against Southampton in the 13th game-week of the Premier League.</p>
          <p>This fixture was very crucial for the Gunners in the hope of remaining in the top-4 of the league. But Arsenal had a disastrous night at the Emirates and the club luckily managed to avoid a defeat.</p>

                <p>By the end of the game, the Saints were leading the scoreboard by 2-1 and a <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/alexandre-lacazette-peculiarly-reacts-to-scoring-equaliser-for-arsenal-vs-southampton/">late equalizer by Alexandre Lacazette</a> made Arsenal earn at least a point by the end of the 90 minutes.</p>

                      <p>One key quote came from DT who said that he left his son at home for his birthday so Arsenal didn’t ruin it for him. “Do you know what, it’s my son’s 9th birthday today and you know what I’ve done for him? I left him at home so I didn’t ruin his birthday. I knew that if I brought him here, they’d f**k it up.”</p>

                          <p>Claude made an appearance to lament ‘The Gunners’ performance which now leaves them in seventh and eight points off the top four. He didn’t bust out his infamous ‘IT’S TIME TO GO’.</p>

                            <p>“I don’t blame him anymore, it’s down to the board now they should have got rid of him in May, they didn’t and now we have to pay the price. I just think that people above him aren’t doing anything about it and they’re just taking the p**s out of us the fan.”</p>
