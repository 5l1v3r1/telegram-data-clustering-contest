      <p>I'm a skeptic when it comes to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-high-tech-beauty-gifts-46860983">beauty products</a> that could be mistaken for <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Beauty-Products-Look-Like-Sex-Toys-37941222">sex toys.</a> (Phalic bottles and pulsing silicone devices, no thank you.) I'm even more unbelieving when a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-hair-care-gifts-2019-46854978">hair tool</a> claims to work by gently pulling on my hair and wrapping it along a steamy barrel. You could understand my hesitation then when I first got my hands on the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Conair-Unbound-Cordless-Auto-Curler-519310?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Conair%20Unbound%20Cordless%20Auto-Curler&amp;retailer=target.com&amp;pid=519310&amp;price=100&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-one%3Apss&amp;evar9=46912619&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fconair-unbound-cordless-auto-curler-review-46912619&amp;list1=hair%2Chot%20tools%2Cconair%2Cbeauty%20review%2Cnewsletter%2Cshoppable&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Aconair-unbound-cordless-auto-curler-review-46912619&amp;pdata=19395787">Conair Unbound Cordless Auto-Curler</a> ($100), which combines a bit of both.</p>
      <p>The high-tech cylindrical device has a slit that reveals a heated barrel that swirls my hair around it with the push of a button. What's brilliant is how this tool nixes the cord, which makes it portable enough to take on-the-go.</p>
      <p>It was the newly-minted spokesperson for the brand, actress <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/madelaine-petsch-beauty-interview-46894751">Madelaine Petsch</a>, who truly convinced me to take it for a test drive. She told me at the product launch event how easy it was to use, and how she curled her long hair with it in 20 minutes. "I could lay in bed and watch Harry Potter and [use] it," she said.</p>
      <p>To put it to the ultimate test, I charged the device, called my Uber, and took it for a ride. Upon stepping into my car, I realized I would be wielding a hot tool in stop-and-go traffic, speed bumps, and one bridge with fast-moving traffic during my trip, which only added to my apprehension.</p>
      <p>Check out the results, ahead.</p>

      <p>My hair is medium-coarse and holds a curl well. Before styling my hair with the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Conair-Unbound-Cordless-Auto-Curler-519310?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Conair%20Unbound%20Cordless%20Auto-Curler&amp;retailer=target.com&amp;pid=519310&amp;price=100&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46912619&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46912619%2Fimage%2F46912649%2FBefore-Using-Conair-Unbound-Cordless-Auto-Curler&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Aconair-unbound-review-46912619&amp;pdata=1">Conair Unbound Cordless Auto-Curler</a> ($100), my hair was straightened (from the day before) and free of any knots.</p>

      <p>The device has three buttons: The large one above the screen causes the heated barrel to spin and grab onto your hair. The smaller button on the right turns the device on and off, while the one on the left adjusts its heat setting. After turning my curler on, I set it to 360 degrees.</p>

      <p>The most confusing part about using the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Conair-Unbound-Cordless-Auto-Curler-519310?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Conair%20Unbound%20Cordless%20Auto-Curler&amp;retailer=target.com&amp;pid=519310&amp;price=100&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-slide%3Apss&amp;evar9=46912619&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fphoto-gallery%2F46912619%2Fimage%2F46912645%2FStep-1-Insert-Your-Hair-Conair-Unbound-Cordless-Auto-Curler&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Aconair-unbound-review-46912619&amp;pdata=19395787">Conair Unbound Cordless Auto-Curler</a> ($100) is inserting your hair into the device. To do so, position the tool so that its screen, buttons, and slit are facing outward. Then, pull a 1/2-inch section of hair from the back of the device toward the front and through the slit.</p>
      <h3>Step 2: Press the Button</h3>
      <figure>
        <video src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/1ZfWkk_Jh9MyZP_psNyP4aLbY_I/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/11/18/823/n/1922153/a2c3e6ec9a6b183d_32e2ef9a4cfa47fbbbe1d3084b18603e/i/Step-2-Press-Button.gif" autoplay="" loop=""/>

      </figure>
      <p>Once your hair is positioned through the slit, push the orange button that sits on top of the screen. The barrel inside of the tool will begin spinning slowly, spinning your hair around it.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, I was nervous to do this, but I realized with how slow the barrel moved, it wouldn't yank or tangle my hair at all. The device immediately stops moving and beeps as soon as it gets jammed — which happened twice as I curled my longest layer — making it easy for your to slide your hair out and try it again.</p>
      <h3>Step 3: Release Your Curl</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>I waited a seven seconds before releasing my curl. Doing so was simple, I just slowly pulled the section of hair from the tool.</p>
      <h3>Step 4: Comb Out Your Curls</h3>
      <figure>
        <video src="https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/mBBTjMI75arZEre2ndC5oT0YO5Q/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/11/18/823/n/1922153/10ce9181f446c1a9_827a5f3581554e92b22ec8ee56877fe7/i/Step-4-Comb-Out-Your-Curls.gif" autoplay="" loop=""/>

      </figure>
      <p>Because some of the curls were very tight, I used my fingers to comb through them and loosen them up. My hair is long, so I was only able to curl my mid-lengths down to the ends.</p>
      <h3>After Using the Unbound Cordless Auto-Curler</h3>

      <p>Curling my entire head took 18 minutes and 38 seconds, and that included me trying to get used to using the device and pausing to take photos (which took, at least, three minutes of my time). The end result was loose, shining cascading waves.</p>
