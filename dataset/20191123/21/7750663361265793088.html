      <h1>Roy Hodgson: 'VAR was right to disallow Crystal Palace goal'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roy-hodgson/"><b>Roy Hodgson</b></a> has admitted that VAR was correct to disallow a goal for his side during this afternoon's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">2-1 defeat</a> to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> at Selhurst Park.</h2>

      <p>The Eagles looked as though they had taken the lead when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-tomkins/"><b>James Tomkins</b></a> nodded in from close range shortly before half time, only for the goal to be disallowed on review due to a push by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jordan-ayew/"><b>Jordan Ayew</b></a> on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dejan-lovren/"><b>Dejan Lovren</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Palace went on to fall to another defeat - their fourth of a five-match winless streak - but Hodgson accepted that the video assistant got the decision right.</p>
      <p>"There has been such a hoo-ha about Arsenal's supposed third goal against us which would have won them the game and what a wicked mistake VAR made," Hodgson told reporters at his post-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"All I'll say is that the foul at the near post in that instance where McCarthy's completely bundled over from the player who flicked the ball on to the middle of the goal - that was a much clearer and worse foul, which luckily for us the VAR picked up.</p>
      <p>"But I don't think that was a mistake from VAR, and I don't think this was a mistake from VAR either. There was a foul at the near post - Jordan did unfortunately push Lovren and VAR picked it up and disallowed the goal, so in my opinion both goals were rightly disallowed."</p>
      <p>Liverpool went on to win the game courtesy of goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sadio-mane/"><b>Sadio Mane</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-firmino/"><b>Roberto Firmino</b></a> either side of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/wilfried-zaha/"><b>Wilfried Zaha</b></a>'s equaliser.</p>
