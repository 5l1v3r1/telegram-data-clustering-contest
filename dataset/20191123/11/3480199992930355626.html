      <p>Sheffield United boss Chris Wilder insists the aura associated with Manchester United remains despite their recent decline.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ trophy-laden era under Sir Alex Ferguson has become a distant memory since his departure in 2013 and, by their own high standards, they are having a hard time.</p>
      <p>Under David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and now Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the gulf to rivals Manchester City and Liverpool has become a chasm.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while the gap to what is often referred to as the chasing pack has narrowed alarmingly – with the Old Trafford club now arguably considered one of those teams.</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s side make the trip cross the Pennines on Sunday to face Sheffield United with Blades boss Wilder tipping them to eventually rediscover their former glories.</p>
      <p>“Manchester United are one of the most iconic teams in the world, and there will always be an aura surrounding them,” said Wilder.</p>
      <p>“No matter how their fortunes on the pitch may fluctuate, it’s still one of football’s true powerhouses that we are talking about whenever we mention their name.</p>

      <p>“They are an incredible football club who are just going through a spell right now where they are not having it all their own way.</p>
      <p>“That happens in football. But fortunes can fluctuate very quickly in this game and they will find their way back to the top, that’s for certain.”</p>
      <p>The Blades will head into the match at Bramall Lane ahead of their opponents in the Premier League table and looking to extend their five-match unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>Asked if this might be a good time to play United, Wilder said: “I think they’ve just won five of their last six games and won three away on the bounce last month, so I think that answers the question.</p>

      <p>“This is still Manchester United. They still have world class players. We went over there to play a training match a few weeks ago and I think my players were surprised at the quality of the team they decided to put out for the game.</p>
      <p>“And then they brought on a load of talented, young whipper-snappers towards the end when our players were tired. So we know the quality they have right through the squad and we know what to expect.”</p>
      <p>Wilder will be without on-loan goalkeeper Dean Henderson, who has to sit out against his parent club, so Simon Moore will be between the posts.</p>
      <p>John Egan is a doubt after the defender suffered a clash of heads with Andreas Cornelius during the Republic of Ireland’s 1-1 draw with Denmark on Monday.</p>
