      <h1>British EuroMillions winner comes forward to claim huge £105million jackpot</h1>
      <h2>The lucky EuroMillions ticket-holder is one of the biggest-ever British lottery winners after scooping a £105million jackpot in the draw last Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:09:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p>A single ticket-holder has come forward to claim the £105million <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/euromillions">EuroMillions</a> jackpot prize won on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The win makes the lucky Brit one of the biggest-ever lottery winners in the UK.</p>
      <p>The winner's identity is still a mystery - it could stay that way if they choose to remain anonymous - and their prize has not yet been paid out as the ticket cannot be validated until Monday morning.</p>
      <p>Six lucky Brits have won big in the EuroMilllions so far this year in what has been a highly successful year for UK punters.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, said: "This is the sixth massive EuroMillions jackpot win in 2019 and follows the nation's biggest ever win of £170million just last month.</p>

      <p>"We now focus on supporting the ticket-holder as they start to enjoy their new-found wealth."</p>
      <p>A EuroMillions spokesperson said: "The prize will be paid out at the ticket validation appointment.</p>
      <p>"The ticket-holder will then decide whether or not to go public and share their news.</p>
      <p>"There will be no information on whether it is an individual or syndicate winner, or where the ticket was purchased, unless the ticket-holder decides to go public."</p>
      <p>Britain could have another big winner on Saturday night, with a £25million Lotto jackpot that must be won.</p>
      <p>The EuroMillions spokesperson added: "This is the sixth EuroMillions jackpot win in the UK this year and further adds to the 5,500 millionaires made by the National Lottery since it launched."</p>
      <p>Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won £114.9million on EuroMillions in the draw on New Year’s Day.</p>
      <p>Ade Goodchild scooped £71million in March and an anonymous ticket-holder bagged £38.2million in April.</p>
      <p>In June, a ticket-holder who chose to remain anonymous won £123million.</p>
      <p>Last month the country’s biggest ever winner was made when an anonymous ticketholder scooped £170million.</p>
      <p>The previous biggest winners in the UK were Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs, North Ayrshire, who won £161million in July 2011.</p>
