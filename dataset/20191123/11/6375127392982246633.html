      <h3>A CALL CENTER agent accused of ordering the murder of his wife and their one-year-old son in Sta. Rosa City in Laguna three years ago on Friday was arrested by the local police on the strength of a warrant of arrest issued by a local court, Laguna Police Provincial Office director Col. Eleazar Matta said yesterday.</h3>
      <p>Ricardo Sta. Ana alias “Ricardo Sta. Ana Esperas Jr.” was tracked down in his workplace at 4th Avenue, Bonifacio Global City in Taguig City around 5:35 p.m. on Friday.</p>
      <p>Members of the Sta. Rosa City Police warrant section led by Master Sergeant Erick Fadriquelan arrested the suspect on the basis of a warrant of arrest for two counts of parricide issued by Judge Gil Judge Sta. Maria Jr. of the Sta. Rosa City Regional Trial Court.</p>
      <p>Fellow employees of the suspect initially tried to prevent the Sta. Rosa City policemen from arresting him, thinking it was illegal, but eventually let the officers do their job after being shown the warrant for Sta. Ana’s arrest.</p>
      <p>The suspect, in 2016, was tagged as the man who ordered the killing of his wife, Pearl Helene, then 29-years old, and their son Denzel.  </p>
      <p>The Laguna police said that the victims were in their house in Bgy. Labas when two hired guns who posed as internet repairmen gained entry into the house of the Sta. Anas.</p>
      <p>Police said the woman was raped by the suspects before she and her son were killed with hammer strikes on the heads.</p>
      <p>The gruesome double murder attracted national attention and triggered a massive police investigation, which later forced a suspect, tricycle driver Ramoncito Gallo, to surrender to the authorities.</p>
      <p>Gallo confessed that it was Sta. Ana who hired him and another suspect named “Bryan” to kill his wife for allegedly having an affair with another man.</p>
      <p>The suspects were believed to be high on drugs when they bludgeoned the woman and her very young son to death.</p>
      <p>In August 2016, the charges filed by the Laguna police against Sta. Ana was ordered dismissed by the Department of Justice, citing insufficient evidence.</p>
      <p>However, the case against Sta. Ana was revived after the second suspect, Bryan Avistado, corroborated Gallo’s previous testimonies following his arrest.</p>
      <p>Despite his vehement denial of the charges against him, Sta. Ana found himself in deep trouble after Avistado identified him as the one who gave them P60,000 and a mobile phone to record the killing of his wife.</p>
      <p>Investigators also recovered a CCTV footage, which showed Sta. Ana meeting with the two suspects inside a fast-food restaurant in Alabang, Muntinlupa City, an hour after the two victims were killed.</p>
      <p>The two confessed assassins said that Sta. Ana paid the remaining balance for the “hit job” and took the cellphone they used to record the crime. </p>
