      <p>With the latest edition of its flagship phone, Samsung "has really delivered," writes Sam Rutherford at <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-phones-you-can-buy-right-now-1830552418"><i>Gizmodo</i></a>. The firm's displays remain "the best in the business," and this model has a triple-lens rear camera, an in-screen fingerprint sensor, 128 GB of base storage, and "ridiculously good" battery life. <b><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/buy/">Buy it at Samsung.</a></b></p>

      <p>The top models cost $1,000 and more, but Apple is wisely letting most buyers get the latest iPhone at a mid-tier price. It runs on the fastest chipset around, and its cameras now feature an ultrawide-angle lens and an excellent Night Mode.<b> <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-11">Buy it at Apple.</a></b></p>

      <p>"A swiftly rising flagship killer," OnePlus makes smartphones with specs comparable to Samsung's. With a 90-hz AMOLED screen and the same snappy processor as the Galaxy S10, the 7 Pro is "by far the best value for a premium smartphone today," per Sascha Segan and Steven Winkelman at <i><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/253146/the-best-phones">PC Mag</a></i>. <b><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-7pro?from=op7pro_header">Buy it at OnePlus.</a></b></p>

      <p>If your budget is $400, "you cannot find a better phone than this," writes Jeffrey Van Camp at <i><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-cheap-phones/">Wired</a></i>. Though it lacks certain luxury features, the Pixel 3a "manages to feel like a high-end $800 phone in the ways that matter most," beginning with a camera that's "as good as anything you can buy." <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_3a"><b>Buy it at Google.</b></a></p>
      <p>5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Power-Alexa-Push-Talk/dp/B07N929634?tag=thwe0f5-20">Motorola Moto G7 Power</a><b> ($249)</b></p>

      <p>Though Motorola's middle child gets by with slightly less RAM, storage space, and one fewer camera than the $299 Moto G7, it's the better choice, because the G7 Power's battery can last three days. "There's simply no better deal for a smartphone under $250," writes Mark Spoonauer at <i><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-smartphones,review-2223.html">Tom's Guide</a></i>. <b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moto-Power-Alexa-Push-Talk/dp/B07N929634?tag=thwe0f5-20">Buy it at Amazon.</a></b></p>
