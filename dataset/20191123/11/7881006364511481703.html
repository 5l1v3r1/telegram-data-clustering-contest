      <p><b>Mumbai</b>: Hours after BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Chief Minister in the early hours of Saturday, with Ajit Pawar as his deputy, Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule had put up a WhatsApp status that pointed at a major rift within the Pawar family and the NCP.</p>
      <p>The status read, “Party and family split”, and was put up soon after the BJP turned tables on rivals with a faction of NCP breaking away under Ajit Pawar — Sule’s cousin and Sharad Pawar's nephew.</p>

      <p>The development brought a major twist in the Maharashtra political scenario as a day earlier it was senior Pawar who had announced that the new Maharashtra government would be led by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray.</p>
