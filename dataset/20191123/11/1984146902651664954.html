      <h1>North Shields salon owner 'lost for words' at 'gangster's wife's' reply to appointment change</h1>
      <h2>Stacey Ward, from Sparkling Beautique, couldn't believe her eyes when she received a torrent of abuse</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:47:58+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks</a></address>
      <p>When salon owner Stacey Ward messaged a client to reschedule her appointment, she was not prepared for the expletive-ridden respond that followed.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-shields">North Shields</a> beautician has shared the bizarre text exchange between her and the woman, who she has now banned.</p>
      <p>The series of messages began when Stacey's colleague informed the client she would be unable to perform her lip treatment as she had the winter vomiting bug, norovirus.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "Hi [name], it's Charnie from Sparkling Beautique, I have caught the Norovirus and Stacey's daughter has it too. Could I reschedule you this week if possible for your lips hun? X'.</p>
      <p>Within seconds, the woman replied - and it wasn't pleasant, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/beautician-stunned-gangsters-wifes-crazy-20936696">the Mirror reports.</a></p>

      <p>She wrote: "Nar f*** off you dirty s***. Get to me f***ing door."</p>
      <p>She continued: "Am going rip you f***ing face off for reschedule."</p>
      <p>The woman added: "CHARNIE. S***."</p>
      <p>Absolutely stunned, the beautician replied" "What?".</p>
      <p>To which another barrage of abuse followed.</p>
      <p>The woman said: "Reschedule my appointment come fight me. I'll kick you up you f**** lips."</p>
      <p>Stacey then decided to get involved and sent her own message.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "This is Stacey, the salon owner. My daughter isn't well so I have asked to reschedule your appointment and this is your reply?"</p>
      <p>The woman quickly responded: "Listen live [sic]. Am a gangsters wife am not someone to be messed around. Me fellas a real villain."</p>
      <p>Stacey posted the messages on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> where thousands of people have shared and commented on the post.</p>
      <p>She wrote: "I mean some customers haven’t been happy with what’s going on today with the salon being closed but this is taking it to a whole new level.</p>
      <p>"I’m actually lost for words, think it’s safe to say this ones now barred from rebooking."</p>
      <p>One social media user replied: "She sounds like a real delight".</p>
      <p>Another added: "Ma’am it’s 2019. Don’t be the gangsters wife, be the gangster."</p>
      <p>A third commented: "Omg that lady is nuts. I wouldn’t even respond to the message."</p>
      <p>Others couldn't believe it was genuine.</p>
      <p>One remarked: "I would bet you have the wrong number on file. This sounds like a joke."</p>
      <p>Another added: "It’s got to be a joke, you got the wrong number I bet, someone’s got the text and they’re responding to it as a joke. Can’t be real! The way she’s talking."</p>
