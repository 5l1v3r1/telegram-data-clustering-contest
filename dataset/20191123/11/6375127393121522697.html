      <h3>JULIE Anne San Jose as host of “The Clash Season 2” says she and co-host Rayver Cruz are both very happy with the finalists who survived the original number of 64 contestants. “Nakakatuwa kasi we have a good set of remaining finalists,” she says. “We’ve seen them grow in the show and they all give outstanding performances. All of them are very talented, but this is a competition, so they have to show us more of their talents all the way to the end. Laban kung laban talaga at matira ang matibay.”</h3>
      <p>Julie Anne has just renewed her exclusive contract with GMA Network and she’s happy to remain a Kapuso.  </p>
      <p>“I’m very happy and blessed. Nagpapasalamat po ako kay Lord and sa GMA for giving me another opportunity to share what I have. I have two regular shows, ‘The Clash’ and ‘Sunday Pinasaya’, then I’m honored to be nominated as best actress in a leading role sa Asian Television Awards for my role in ‘Barangay 143’. I also have a new single, ‘Isang Gabi’, which I did with Rico Blanco. As a Clash host, nakakatuwang makita ang lahat ng pinagdaraanan ng Clashers and it brought back memories of the time when I also joined a singing contest, ‘Popstars’, where GMA discovered me.”</p>
      <p>She seems so at home with co-host Rayver Cruz. “Yes, nakapag-adjust agad kami sa isa’t isa after we went through a workshop for hosting under Direk Floy Quintos who taught us to listen to each other para maging mas masaya ang banter namin as co-hosts. Actually, kabado talaga ako noong una kasi ang first host ng ‘The Clash’ was Ate Regine Velasquez, tough act to follow. But she’s so nice, she even texted me, congratulating me and wishing me well as the new host. I will always look up to her at hindi mawawala ang respect and admiration ko for her.”</p>
      <p>Tonight, Sunday, prepare for another intense battle among the remaining Clashers. Janina Gonzales will belt out her hugot  song “Somebody to Love” by Queen.  Antoinette Tismo pours her heart out through the song “Mama Knows Best.” The RnB Sweetheart of Qatar  Thea Astley gives her own rendition of the jukebox hit “Kung Liligaya ka sa Piling ng Iba.”  Watch out for Sassa Dagdag’s own take on Alicia Key’s chart-topping hit “Fallin’.” And Nef Medina will serenade us with his own version of Calum Scott’s song “Dancing on my Own.” Find out who among these Clashers will make it to the Top 8 and who will bid goodbye and take his/her final bow on the Clash Arena. Also watch out for Clash Masters Julie and Rayver Cruz as they do a collab number with the Pinoy band Silent Sanctuary! All this and more this Sunday on the most nerve-wracking singing competition on Philippine TV, “The Clash”, isa laban sa lahat.</p>
