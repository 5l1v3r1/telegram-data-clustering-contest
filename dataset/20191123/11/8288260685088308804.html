      <p>A ticket-holder has come forward to claim the £105 million EuroMillions jackpot</p>
      <p>prize won on Tuesday, National Lottery operator Camelot has announced.</p>
      <p>The winning numbers were 8, 10, 15, 30 and 42, with 4 and 6 selected for the Lucky Star numbers.</p>
      <p>It is the sixth Euromillions jackpot that has been banked this year.</p>
      <p>It also coincides with the 25th anniversary of the first National Lottery draw.</p>
      <p>Another player also became a millionaire by matching the "Millionaire Maker" code ZMSF62402.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' advisor at The National Lottery, said earlier this week: "On our 25th birthday, one very lucky ticket-holder has scooped tonight's entire £105m EuroMillions jackpot.</p>
      <p>"Players across the country are now urged to check their tickets to see if they have won big."</p>
      <p>He added that last night's "big winner has scooped the sixth EuroMillionsjackpot banked in the UK this year."</p>
