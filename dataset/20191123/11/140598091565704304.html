      <p>I’m not sure who invented condensed milk ice cream – I first came across it on the side of a Carnation milk tin decades ago. It makes a brilliant no-churn ice cream: on the sweet side and so good with a tangy ripple.</p>
      <p>If you can’t get frozen blackcurrants (whole food shops often have them in the freezer section) then half a jarful of jam, mixed with a spoonful or two of lemon juice will work just fine, as will any fruit compote.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes, plus freezing time | <b>Cooking time: </b>5 minutes </p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>eight</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>250g frozen blackcurrants</li>
        <li>4 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>600ml double cream</li>
        <li>1 x 397g tin condensed milk</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the blackcurrants gently in a pan with two tablespoons of water and the sugar until the sugar dissolves. Allow to bubble briefly then leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Put the cream and condensed milk in a large bowl and beat with an electric whisk until very thick. Scrape the mixture into a plastic freezerproof box.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the blackcurrant compote over the top, then give the ice cream a single s-shaped stir. Put the lid on the box and freeze for at least six hours.</li>
      </ol>
