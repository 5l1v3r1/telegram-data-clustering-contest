      <p>NAIROBI, Kenya — Authorities say heavy rains in western Kenya created overnight floods that have killed 17 people, including 12 people feared buried in a mudslide.</p>
      <p>In West Pokot county, local administrator Joel Bulal said Saturday that 12 people died in a mudslide in the village of Nyarkulian and four people are missing in the village of Parua.</p>
      <p>West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said five other people died when their car was swept away on the road between Kitale and Lodwar after two rivers overflowed their banks.</p>
      <p>More than 1 million people in East Africa have been affected by flooding after higher-than-normal rainfall.</p>
      <p>The International Rescue Committee said this month that many people had been reeling from an earlier severe drought. Now rains in parts of Somalia, South Sudan and Kenya are expected for four to six more weeks.</p>
