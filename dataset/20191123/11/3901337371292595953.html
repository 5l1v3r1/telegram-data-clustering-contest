      <p>Kaizer Chiefs have been lauded for their turnaround this season under coach Ernst Middendorp, as the team finalises preparations for this weekend’s Telkom Knockout semi-final against Maritzburg United. </p>

      <p>Amakhosi will go to the Mbombela Stadium on Sunday as favourites due to their impressive form, having lost only one match since the season started, and former midfielder Junior Khanye points out what he believes is working for Middendorp and the team.    </p>
      <p>“Let’s give credit where it is due, Kaizer Chiefs is winning and how they do it is not important right now. Having a pre-season with the team has helped Ernst Middendorp,” Khanye told the Siya crew.</p>

      <p>“Another thing on what is working for Chiefs is that the team is fit. Chiefs players are fit and they are working as a team. The confidence has (returned) to the team because they are winning. They should be commended for winning their matches, because that’s what football is all about at the end of the day. Failing to finish in the top eight in the previous season, and coming back the way they have done this season isn’t 'pap en vleis'. I give credit to players and the coach,” added the Daveyton-born player.    </p>
