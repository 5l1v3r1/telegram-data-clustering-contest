      <h1>Confirmed West Ham team vs Spurs: Ogbonna returns and Roberto starts in goal</h1>
      <h2>The teams are in at London Stadium as West Ham take on their bitter rivals and their new head coach Jose Mourinho</h2>

      <p>Manuel Pellegrini has made two changes to his starting lineup from the 3-0 defeat to Burnley as they take on Spurs in the lunchtime kick off at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>The headline news is that Angelo Ogbonna is back at centre half for the first time in a month having dropped him for the draw with Sheffield United and he replaces Fabian Balbuena in the starting line up.</p>
      <p>The other change comes in midfield as Andriy Yarmolenko starts at the expense of Pablo Fornals.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has stuck with under-fire goalkeeper Roberto in between the sticks and hasn't been tempted to replace him with Dabid Martin despite the Spaniard's gaffe at Burnley last time out.</p>
      <p>Mark Noble is fit enough to start in midfield having recovered from a twisted ankle he suffered in the loss at Turf Moor and he lines up alongside Declan Rice as usual in the Hammers midfield.</p>

      <p>Ryan Fredericks resumes his role at right back and Aaron Cresswell continues on the opposite flank with Felipe Anderson in front of him and Robert Snodgrass in the middle.</p>
      <p>Sebastien Haller leads the line once again having scored just one goal since August.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio is not risked from the start despite coming through a behind-closed-doors game against the Hammers U23s last week though he is on the bench.</p>
      <p>Jack Wilshere, as reported by <b>football.london</b>, is not in the squad thanks to a stomach problem. Arthur Masuaku is once again not in the matchday 18 either.</p>
      <p><b>West Ham: </b>Roberto; Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell; Rice, Noble, Anderson, Snodgrass, Yarmolenko; Haller.</p>
