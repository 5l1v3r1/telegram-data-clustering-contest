      <p>Although <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/bbc-breakfast/bbcs-steph-mcgovern-prepares-for-maternity-leave/">she is currently on maternity leave</a> from BBC Breakfast, Steph won't be returning to the morning show once it has finished.</p>
      <p>Instead, she is moving to Channel 4 to host her own daily programme called The Steph Show, which will be a mix of entertainment, lifestyle and current affairs.</p>
      <p>The show is set to launch in Spring 2020 and - before she gave birth - Steph told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50123720">BBC</a>: "This is a dream come true for me and I can't wait to get started next year. Just a small matter of having a baby first!"</p>
