      <h1>I only take criticism from people of my standard: Nawazuddin Siddiqui</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:15:26+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>In an interview with <i>Pinkvilla</i>, the star revealed he is not bothered by the flak that has come his way. Speaking <i>Sacred Games 2</i> being slammed, Nawazuddin said, “Who are these people? I only take criticism from people who are of my standard.</p>
      <p>Today, every second person is there to criticise. Yes, I know the show got a little boring but these people criticising, do they have knowledge of cinema?”</p>
      <p>He continued, “I can take criticism when the person has equal or more knowledge of cinema. But I won’t listen to any <i>aira gaira natu gaira</i> (Tom, Dick or Harry). I am a trained actor and I do not take criticism from anyone and everyone.”</p>
      <p>Nawazuddin admitted that Gaitonde, his character in <i>Sacred Games</i>, is too negative and he would not play the character anymore, shattering the possibility of a third season.“People are okay watching vulgar songs and scenes but when it comes to abuses said by a character which goes with its traits, they cannot take it,” he added.</p>
      <p>Co-directed by Anurag Kashyap and Neeraj Ghaywan, season two features Nawazuddin, Saif Ali Khan, Pankaj Tripathi, Kalki Koechlin and Ranvir Shorey in lead roles. The first season was co-directed by Anurag and Vikram Motwane and also featured Radhika Apte and Kubbra Sait.</p>
      <p>Talking about<i> Sacred Games</i> earlier, Anurag told <i>Hindustan Times</i>, “There’s a whole lot of people there who don’t watch cinema precisely for this reason, because they feel that when they watch films and TV, they are treated like children. <i>Sacred Games</i>, allowed us to tell the story like it wanted to be told, deserved to be told. I think that’s part of why people loved it.”</p>
      <p>Prior to the release of the second season, Nawazuddin also mentioned that it will be the ‘baap’ (father) of the first one. “This season will be the <i>baap</i> of the first one. Even if people know Ganesh Gaitonde, they won’t know what to expect from him. We shot extensively across Mombasa, Cape Town and Johannesburg,” he said at the time.</p>
      <p>The actor’s character of gangster Ganesh Gaitonde traces his origins in season one while in a parallel plot, Saif’s role of inspector Sartaj Singh goes on a race-against-time mission to save Mumbai from an impending attack. Gaitonde is killed in the first episode of the series and the rest of the season tells his story in flashback.</p>
      <p>Season two, on the other hand, explores Ganesh’s life story and his relationship with Pankaj Tripathi’s character, Guruji. Tripathi also shot in Africa for season two. The first season of <i>Sacred Games</i> became a huge success. Netflix recently revealed that two out of three viewers of the show were from outside India. Recalling the moment he realised when the show had become a hit, the <i>Manto</i> star said, “I realised the impact of the show when I was shooting in Rome, a week after its release. People came up to me to click pictures. My team would show me the memes that were doing the rounds on the internet.”</p>
