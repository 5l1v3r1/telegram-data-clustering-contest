      <h1>Bristol's nightlife according to brutally honest Facebook and TripAdvisor reviews</h1>
      <h2>Gripes include sticky floors, grim toilets and being 'started on' by freshers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:57:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Bristol's nightlife scene is legendary, from live gigs on-board Thekla to the award-winning Motion.</p>
      <p>However, there's always an interesting array of experiences when it comes to nights out and not everyone will walk away content.</p>
      <p>Some brutally honest reviews on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> and TripAdvisor provide an insight into the highs and lows of partying at some of the city's most iconic venues.</p>
      <p>While some gripes are clearly from people who just love to have a moan, it just goes to show the range of impressions a night out in Bristol can leave.</p>
      <h3>Motion</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Motion is one of the UK's best nightclubs in the UK and has received hundreds of positives reviews from ravers on Facebook.</p>
      <p>However, despite being <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/bristols-motion-been-named-best-2327226">named the best large club in the UK</a>  in December last year, not everyone agreed it was a five-star experience.</p>
      <p>Here are some brutally honest reactions to a night out at the venue:</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. "What a venue. Sound system was crazy and vibe was nuts."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>2. "The toilets were disgusting, but the entertainment was very good."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. "Great venue with fabulous staff! Toilets need a bit more tlc."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. "Terribly crowded and ridiculously hot."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. "The main room was so packed and so unbearably hot it was like being in a sauna. The lasers were cool."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>6. "The bar ran out of Vodka by 8pm."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>7. "Great sound system and a really good crowd - no weirdos bumbling around."</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Lakota</h3>

        <figcaption>Lakota will be hosting one of the biggest St Paul's Carnival's after parties</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Lakota is one of the city's most legendary venues and has attracted mostly positive reviews on both Facebook and TripAdvisor.</p>
      <p>For some, the club is a 'Bristol institution' with plenty of character while others have taken issue with the sound quality and 'grim' toilets.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at what people have said:</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. "This club is a Bristol institution. If you like underground electronic music, and you like it loud and clear, this is one of the places to go to."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>9. "It's got character. Not the cleanest of places but when you are having fun and vibing with the other goers you'll be having the time of your life!"</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>10. "The sound quality was rubbish and it was far too loud. Don't go there without ear plugs."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>11. "Cheap drinks by club standards but the toilets pretty grim at the best of times."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>12. "Waited 20 minutes for one can of Stella. Twice in the same night."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>13. "Had a better night at the Domino's up the street."</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Thekla</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Not many cities can say they have a nightclub on a boat which is considered one of the country's most iconic venues.</p>
      <p>Thekla is well-known in Bristol as a venue for live gigs and has won multiple awards over the years.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, it's no surprise that the majority of reviews are hugely positive - despite the occasional complaint about sticky floors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>14. "The best, and most unusual, music venue in Bristol."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>15. "Great venue, good bar, nice and sweaty too, everything a great live music venue should have."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>16. "Great little venue, so much less damp and disgusting than 30 years ago."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>17. "If you want to get started on by a fresher and listen to cheesy music and pay stupid money then here's the club for you."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>18. "The venue had a ridiculously sticky floor, so it was absolutely impossible to jig around."</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Pryzm</h3>

      <p>Pryzm is one of the largest nightclubs in Bristol and hosts events featuring some of the biggest DJs.</p>
      <p>According to its website, the club offers a combination of "excitement, atmosphere, elegance and opulence".</p>
      <p>Despite the mostly positive reviews, it's fair to say not everyone agrees.</p>
      <p>
        <b>19. "Went there yesterday for comedy night. It was a huge disappointment, only laughed three times all night -  my own jokes were better."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>20. "Great music and atmosphere - great value for what you pay to get in."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>21. "My gran has more up to date carpets!"</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>22. "Could barely walk anywhere without being barged into."</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>23. "When you go in straight away my shoes were sticking to the carpets.... why even have carpet in a club anyway?"</b>
