      <p>Coronation Street viewers recognised a familiar face this week, as an actor returned to Weatherfield for his fifth stint playing a new character.</p>
      <p>Mark Chatterton is on his fifth stint and fourth role <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/coronation-street-fans-stunned-adam-17278034">on the Cobbles</a> after first appearing as Neville Hawthorne in a few episodes in 1986.</p>
      <p>He returned for a run in 1992 and 1993 when he was cast as Gordon Blinkhorn, Raquel Wolstenholme’s admirer - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/coronation-street-actor-baffles-after-20941686">reports Mirror Online.</a></p>
      <p>And after a one-off appearance as Gerry Burton in 2003, he returned as Neville in 2005 and 2007.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/eagle-eyed-coronation-street-fans-17304044">Corrie fans</a> recognised the actor, as he appeared on screen playing his fourth character - pawn shop owner Barry Morgan.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-coronation-street-viewers-baffled-17292768">Several viewers</a> recognised the actor straight away, while others wondered where they'd seen him before.</p>
      <p>One fan said: “Classic Corrie guest star alert! That was Raquel’s ex-boyfriend Gordon-slash-Norris’s son in law Neville — actor Mark Chatterton — as the pawn shop owner.”</p>
      <p>Another said: “He's been in Corrie on and off for years. So funny to see him reappear in yet another guise!”</p>
      <p>And fans were very grateful to vigilant Corrie lovers for reminding them why Chatterton’s face was so familiar.</p>

      <p>But this is not the first time Coronation Street devotees have noticed reoccurring actors on the soap.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Carla Connor was reunited with a familiar face as she headed to hospital following her mental breakdown.</p>
      <p>The actress, played by actress Olwen May had been in the ITV soap before, filming alongside Carla and Peter in 2011 after her harrowing rape ordeal at the hands of evil ex Frank Foster.</p>
      <p>But in this era, she played a different character and portrayed the role of DC Joyce Malone who was leading the investigation into the allegations against Frank.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t the only character Olwen has played on the ITV soap though, with the actress having been on the show in a whopping five different roles.</p>
      <p>Before her stint in 2011, the actress played Jessica Lundy in 1999 and 2000.</p>
      <p>In this stint she was a reverend, and she married Hayley and Roy Cropper.</p>
      <p>Prior to this, Olwen played another detective on the soap, portraying DC Chapman in 1991.</p>
      <p>Finally, her other role in the soap was in 1990, when she played a character named Christine Woods who was a recruitment agent.</p>
