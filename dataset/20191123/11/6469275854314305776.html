      </p>
      <p>Prizes for the competition total £210 – the highest ever prize fund.</p>

      <p>Maximum word count is 2,500 and the closing date is 15 December 2019 at midnight.</p>
      <p>The shortlist will be judged by the competition’s sponsors: editorial consultancy Fiction Feedback www.fictionfeedback.co.uk whose editor-in-chief, Dea Parkin, is based in Chorley (and is Secretary of the UK’s largest organisation for crime writers, the Crime Writers’ Association, which awards the famous Daggers for best crime writing.)</p>
      <p>The first prize is £100, second prize £50 and there are three third prizes of £20.</p>
      <p>Shortlisted entrants will be listed online and the winning stories will be published online and possibly in print.</p>

      <p>Subscribed members of the Writers’ Circle are entitled to one free entry.</p>
      <p>Entrants can live anywhere in the UK or be a British citizen living abroad.</p>
      <p>The story mustn’t have been published in print before (online is fine) or won first prize in a competition.</p>
      <p>Chorley crime writer DJ Harrison said: "We hope writers have fun writing a story with this very versatile theme in mind.</p>
      <p>"Judging criteria are: – interpretation of theme; originality; quality of writing, for example pace, flow, characterisation, plot and style; and quality of prose, including grammar, spelling and punctuation.</p>
      <p>"We hope that’s helpful and look forward to receiving your entry by 15 December."</p>
      <p>People can enter by post or by email and pay their entry fee by cheque or by PayPal.</p>
