      <h2>The Kiwi was nervous about the public reaction on their return from Japan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:28:14+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>Joe Schmidt has admitted hiding away after Ireland's Rugby World Cup dreams ended in a whimper.</p>
      <p>The New Zealander led Ireland to three Six Nations titles, including a Grand Slam, and two historic wins over his native All Blacks.</p>
      <p>But their hopes of reaching a first ever World Cup final were damaged with a shock defeat to hosts Japan before they were sent packing by New Zealand in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>It was another disappointing from Ireland on the biggest stage and Schmidt has revealed that he was nervous about the public reaction on their return from Japan.</p>
      <p>He said on The Late Late Show: "I was disappointed. I didn't really want to meet people and have them disappointed as well. </p>
      <p>"You know when you get off the flight you're going to walk straight into cameras that are at the airport. We'd been up at 3am to catch our flight and I didn't really catch our flight.</p>
      <p>"You get in - and I'm not sure what I said in the interview now - but you're probably not at your peak.</p>
      <p>"I did hide away for a while. And my wife said let's get out of town then. We went to Spain for a few days which was great."</p>

      <p>Schmidt also said he believes Ireland started thinking about the World Cup too early and got away from the 'week to week' approach.</p>
      <p>He said: "The only thing that we hadn't achieved, having beaten everyone, won the Slam, won Six Nations, was that World Cup and even getting to that semi-final. </p>
      <p>"We said everything else is secondary to us getting to that World Cup final or World Cup semi-final. </p>
      <p>"We didn't prioritise the Six Nations the way we normally would have. We were always a week to week team. Just making sure we focused on what was immediately in front of us. </p>
      <p>"I think we started to project our thoughts too far in advance and we didn't perform well in the Six Nations. Our confidence ebbed a little bit and we lost our rhythm. </p>
      <p>"We never quite got it back. I thought after the Scotland game that we were on an upswing and the plan was coming to fruition.</p>
      <p>"But we were vulnerable the following week and we never really picked ourselves up."</p>
