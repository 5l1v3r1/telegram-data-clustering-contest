      <h1>‘Terminator: Dark Fate’ Director Tim Miller Says He’ll Never Work With James Cameron Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:52:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>With “Terminator: Dark Fate” flopping at the box office, the film’s director is opening up about his creative clashes with producer James Cameron, revealing he won’t work with Cameron again after the “trauma” of making the movie.</p>
      <p>Cameron spoke with <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483284/james-cameron-compares-working-on-alita-battle-angel-with-terminator-dark-fate"><i>CinemaBlend</i></a> in October about his behind-the-scenes conflict with Miller, admitting “blood is still being scrubbed off the walls from [the] creative battles,” adding: “This is a film that was forged in fire. But that’s the creative process, right?”</p>
      <p>Miller sat down with <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-business/terminator-dark-fate-director-on-the-bumpy-road-to-a-box-office-bomb/tim-miller-on-terminator-box-office-woes-im-processing-but-im-very-proud-of-the-movie">KCRW</a> radio and detailed his side of the creative bloodbath.</p>

      <p>“I’m sure we could write a book on why it didn’t work,” he said of the film, which has earned just $58 million at the domestic box office. “I’m still not sure and I’m processing, but I’m very proud of the movie.”</p>
      <p>Asked about Cameron’s comments, Miller revealed that the “Titanic” director wrested control of the film from him. “Even though Jim is a producer and David Ellison is a producer, and they technically have final cut and ultimate power, my name is still on it as director,” he explained. “Even if I’m going to lose the fight… I still feel this obligation to fight because that is what the director is supposed to do. Fight for the movie.”</p>
      <p>According to Miller, he found not having “ultimate control” over his own film to be too difficult. “You can work that way as a director, quite successfully, but I can’t.”</p>

      <p>Asked if he would ever work with Cameron again, he said, ”No,” adding: “It has nothing to do with whatever trauma I have from the experience. It’s more that I just don’t want to be in a situation again where I don’t have the control to do what I think is right.”</p>
      <p>Miller also revealed that Cameron sent him an email attempting to bury the hatchet. “I know we clashed a little bit. I put it all down to two strong, creative people with differences of opinion and I think it made the movie better,” read the email, said Miller. “I’ll be back in L.A. in December. Let’s go get a beer.”</p>
