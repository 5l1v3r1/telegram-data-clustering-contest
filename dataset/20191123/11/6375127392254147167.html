      <h3>PBA stars to carry national colors in SEAG basketball.</h3>
      <p>AN all-professional squad will carry the national colors in the 30th SEA Games basketball competititions, and losing is definitely not in its vocabulary.</p>
      <p>For the record, the country has won this event 17 times in 19 tries since 1977 and an 18th gold medal will be an easy picking for this beloved group of PBA stars.</p>
      <p>Although they’re coming off a shameful campaign in the last Fiba World Cup where they didn’t win a single game, they are highly anticipated to do the opposite this time—win all their games in this tournament where the opposition is undeniably weak.</p>
      <p>“Baligtad ngayon. Kung noon (World Cup) hindi sila nanalo, dito sa SEA Games, hindi naman sila matatalo. Kayang kaya ang kalaban,” said Daniel Aguila, a basketball guru from  Fairview who correctly predicted and wrote that Gilas wouldn’t win a single game in the World Cup.</p>
      <p>Twelve players culled from several PBA clubs made up the squad, the first all-pro squad to represent the country in the  SEA Games which kick off in glittering rites on Saturday, Nov. 30, at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan.</p>
      <p>Multi-titled Tom Cone of Ginebra will coach the team composed of June Mar Fajardo (San Miguel Beer), Marcio Lassiter (SMB). Stanley Pringle (Ginebra), Chris Ross (SMB), LA Tenorio (Ginebra). Matthew Wright (Phoenix), Kiefer Ravena (NLEX), Christian Standhardinger (Northport), Vic Manuel (Alaska), Roger Pogoy (Talk ‘N Text), Troy Rosario (TnT) and Japeth Aguilar (Ginebra).</p>
      <p>For Ravena and Standhardinger, this marks the second straight time that they will don the PH uniform after playing in 2017 SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur where the Filipinos went unbeaten on the way to the championship.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to People’s Journal, Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas president Al Panlilio said “they have complete trust in the team and we’re excited to defend our crown as the best basketball team in the region”.</p>
      <p>The 12 players were part of a pool named a few months ago. The three who didn’t make it were Scottie Thomson, Greg Slaughter and Art dela Cruz, all Ginebra mainstays.</p>
      <p>The Filipinos open their campaign on Dec. 4 against Singapore at the MOA Arena, a game which they can win handily even if they shooting arms are tied, or they left eyes  are closed.</p>
      <p>“Kayang kaya ‘yan (Singapore). Baka hindi man lang sila pawisan,” said Aguila, smiling as PJ talked to him over a cup of coffee yesterday. “Winning margin? Mahina ang 30 lamang .”</p>
      <p>After the Singaporeans, the Filipinos return to the court on Dec. 6 to face Vietnam and finish their elimination round schedule on Dec. 7 against Myanmar, a nation where they are more temples than basketball courts.   </p>
      <p>The team is presently on a break and will resume practice at the end of the quarterfinals of the PBA Governors’ Cup.</p>
