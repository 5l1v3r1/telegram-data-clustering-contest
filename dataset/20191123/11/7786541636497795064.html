      <p><b>MOSCOW (AP)</b> - Russia's foreign minister says the U.S.-Japan security alliance poses "a problem" for Russia-Japan relations and complicates peace treaty talks.</p>
      <p>The two countries have been struggling to negotiate a peace treaty after World War II because of a territorial dispute. The Soviet Union took the four southernmost Kuril Islands during the final days of the war, which Japan asserts territorial rights to.</p>
      <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Saturday that Japan's "military alliance with Washington, of course, is a problem" when it comes to changing the nature of the country's relationship with Russia.</p>
      <p>Lavrov said the Japanese government promised to address Russia's concerns.</p>
      <p>He added that implementation of the 1956 Soviet-Japanese Declaration, which outlined conditions for a peace treaty, was not possible with the U.S. military presence in Japan.</p>
