        <b>The US State Department has been forced to release records relating to President Trump's dealings with Ukraine following a Freedom of Information request.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The documents have been released to the ethics watchdog American Oversight, which show repeated contact between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani.</p>
      <p>Mr Giuliani is shown to have been in contact with Mr Pompeo multiple times in the months before the US Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was recalled in May.</p>
      <p>The pair talked on 26 March and 29 March according to the documents.</p>
      <p>Austin Evers, executive director of American Oversight, said the documents are clear paper evidence linking Mr Giuliani, Mr Pompeo and President Trump to an alleged smear campaign against Ms Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>He said: “We can see why Mike Pompeo has refused to release this information to Congress.</p>
      <p>"It reveals a clear paper trail from Rudy Giuliani to the Oval Office to secretary Pompeo to facilitate Giuliani’s smear campaign against a US ambassador.”</p>
      <p>The revelation comes after Ms Yovanovitch told the impeachment enquiry on Wednesday that she felt there had been a smear campaign against her led by Giuliani.</p>

      <p>The documents also include a report, apparently in reference to Trump hotel stationery, that includes an interview from 23 January 2019 with Ukraine's former prosecutor general, Victor Shokin.</p>
      <p>It says that Mr Giuliani and two associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were present during the interview.</p>
      <p>Parnas and Fruman were arrested last month on charges of conspiracy, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission and falsification of records.</p>
      <p>Both men had key roles in Giuliani's plan to force a Ukrainian corruption investigation into President Trump's democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>A second memo appears to summarise an interview with Yuri Lutsenko, also a former prosecutor general of Ukraine, conducted in the presence of Mr Giuliani, Mr Parnas and Mr Fruman.</p>
      <p>The impeachment enquiry is investigating claims against the President that he threatened to withhold US aid to Ukraine unless they agreed to investigate Mr Biden.</p>
      <p>President Trump has strongly denied the claims and called repeatedly called the inquiry a "witch hunt".</p>
