      <p>The number of teenagers stabbed to death in the capital is now at its highest level for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>This year alone some 23 teens have been fatally attacked and grieving relatives have called the statistics ‘seriously alarming.’</p>
      <p>The grim toll is one more than the total for 2008 and on the way to surpassing the 26 young lives who were lost in 2007.</p>
      <p>This year’s youngest victim was just 14 years old.</p>

      <p>Mohammed Usman Mirza, 19, became the latest after he was killed in Ilford on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>A total of 25 teenagers have died in 2019, 23 of whom suffered fatal knife wounds.</p>

      <p>Her father Peter told the BBC: ‘Over 20 teenagers have been fatally stabbed this year and that is shocking to me.</p>
      <p>‘You read about it and you go “oh that sucks” but when it is really close to your heard you wonder why are people doing this?’</p>
      <p>Her Uncle Terry called the situation ‘alarming’ and added: ‘It is proof that this knife epidemic is spiralling out of control.’</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police told Metro.co.uk that they have launched 124 murder inquiries this year.</p>
      <p>British Transport Police are dealing with a further three, meaning the total is close to surpassing that of last year.</p>
      <p>In 2018 some 135 people were murdered or unlawfully killed and the murder rate overtook that of New York for the first time.</p>

      <p>Commissioner Cressida Dick has previously said that detectives were operating in a ‘very challenging’ environment and had been met with a ‘wall of silence’ in some cases.</p>
      <p>Campaigners have said knife crime is a symptom of a wider problem within London based around poverty and attraction to gang culture.</p>
      <p>Last month the chief executive of charity Barnado’s, Javed Khan, said: ‘It’s totally unacceptable that the knife crime crisis continues to claim so many young lives, with offences at a record high.</p>
      <p>‘Knife crime is a symptom of a much wider, complex problem. Too many young people are suffering a “poverty of hope” and facing a future with no qualifications, no job prospects and no role models, making them vulnerable to criminal gangs who force them to deliver drugs and carry knives.’</p>
