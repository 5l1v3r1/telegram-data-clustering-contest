      <h1>DILG backs Bato’s bill putting all jails under BJMP control</h1>

      <h3>THE Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) is supporting Senator Ronaldo ‘Bato’ dela Rosa’s bill seeking to transfer control and supervision of all provincial and sub-provincial jails from the provincial governments to the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP).</h3>
      <p>“Placing all jails under one government jail institution is not only timely but needed.</p>
      <p>“It’s just logical that all provincial jails in the country be integrated under BJMP as this will prompt a more standard implementation of policies for our jails. Nararapat lamang na magkaroon ng matibay at pantay-pantay na pamamahala at pangangalaga ang ating mga kababayan sa ating mga bilangguansaid ,” Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo M. Año.</p>
      <p>“Panahon na din para ilagak ang pangangasiwa ng mga bilangguan sa bansa sa BJMP. This will result in more professionally-run provincial jails,” he added.</p>
      <p>BJMP records showed that of the 74 provincial jails, 13 jails are now being supervised and manned by the BJMP by virtue of a memorandum of agreement between the LGUs and the provincial governments.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, seven provinces have no provincial jails and utilize the BJMP district jails for their requirements.</p>
      <p>Año said Dela Rosa’s  bill, once passed and approved, will facilitate better management of provincial jails under competent and highly trained personnel of BJMP, “maximizing the Bureau’s resources for efficient delivery of basic services for our persons deprived of liberty (PDLs).”</p>
      <p>He explained  al though provincial governments have been coping with the challenges of managing provincial and sub-provincial jails, it is irrefutable that the overall national standard of jail management can be improved once all jails are put under BJMP, one of DILG’s attached-agencies.</p>
      <p>He said there are reports of escapes in local government unit-ran jails due to ill-trained personnel and inadequate facilities.  </p>
      <p>“As the national government continually earmarks more budget to the BJMP to address pressing issues such as congestion, placing provincial jails under the Bureau’s care can only lead to improved services for our PDLs.</p>
      <p>“Plus, it’s one less problem for the LGUs. Mas makapagbibigay sila ng atensyon sa pagbibigay ng basic and social services sa mga mamamayan,” Año pointed out.</p>
