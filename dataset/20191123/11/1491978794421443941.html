        <i>Caramelised white chocolate has an irresistible toffee flavour that sits beautifully on the biscuit base of this cheesecake-like mousse</i>
      </p>
      <p>I’m not usually a big fan of white chocolate. It sits in a blandly sweet third place behind milk and dark; it’s the Liberal Democrats of chocolate (technically a three-horse race, but you know it’s never really going to be anyone’s first pick).</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever had similar thoughts, this might be the recipe for you. Gently roasting white chocolate on a low heat caramelises the sugars, taking you from one-dimensional sweetness to a gloriously rich, toffee-chocolate heaven.</p>
      <h3>Caramelised white chocolate mousse</h3>
      <p>If you’re in a rush, this tip from my boyfriend might help: “You can substitute the caramelised white chocolate for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramac">Caramac.</a>” The flavour isn’t exactly the same, but it’s reminiscent enough to make a good stand-in.</p>
      <p>Prep <b>1 hr</b><br/>Cook <b>1 hr 30 min</b><br/>Serves <b>10</b></p>
      <p>For the biscuit base<br/><b>60g butter</b>, melted, plus extra for greasing<br/><b>100g Hobnob biscuits</b><br/><b>20g caster sugar</b><br/><b>35g whole almonds</b>, roughly chopped to coarse crumbs</p>
      <p>For the mousse<br/><b>300g white chocolate</b><br/><b>280g double cream</b><br/><b>200g Greek yoghurt</b><br/><b>100g cream cheese</b><br/><b>4 large egg yolks</b><br/><b>2 gelatin leaves</b>, soaked in cold water</p>
      <p>To garnish<br/><b>Fresh berries</b>, such as physalis</p>
      <p>Start with the biscuit base. Line the base and sides of a 20cm round cake tin with greaseproof paper and brush with a little melted butter. Blitz the biscuits to crumbs in a food processor, then stir in the sugar, nuts and butter. Press the mixture firmly into the tin and bake at 190C (180C fan)/gas 6 for 15 minutes, then set aside to cool.</p>
      <p>Turn the oven down to 140C (130C fan)/ gas 2. To caramelise the white chocolate, put the chocolate bars on a baking tray and into the oven, removing every 10-15 minutes to stir, especially at the edges. After about an hour, the chocolate will be caramelised and a toffee-brown colour.</p>
      <p>Next, make the mousse. In a saucepan over a low-medium heat, melt 220g caramelised chocolate with 80g cream, all of the yoghurt and the cream cheese. Leave to cool, then add the yolks and cook, stirring, over a medium heat for a few minutes, until thickened. Cool for five minutes, then shake off any excess water from the gelatin and stir into the mix.</p>
      <p>Once the chocolate custard is lukewarm, but before the gelatin has set, whisk the remaining cream until airy, but before peaks form. Fold into the custard, pour the mixture on to the biscuit base and leave in the fridge for several hours to set. To serve, turn out of the tin and serve with fresh berries.</p>
