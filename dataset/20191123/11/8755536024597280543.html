      <p>Elizabeth Banks shocked viewers last night after she made a controversial joke about Prince Andrew on The Graham Norton Show.</p>
      <p>The actress appeared on the show on Friday alongside Ricky Gervais, Kylie Minogue and Lewis Hamilton, and during her interview, she took a pop at the Duke of York.</p>
      <p>Graham tried to embarrass Elizabeth by showing an old photo of her from when she was a teenager, and then pointed out a stray hand touching her shoulder in the picture.</p>

      <p>Graham said: “I’ve only just noticed this hand, is it someone saying, ‘You’ll regret this photograph?'”</p>
      <p>Causing jaws to drop in the audience, Elizabeth replied, “That’s Prince Andrew’s hand.”</p>
      <p>A shocked Ricky Gervais said, “Oh God, Jesus,” before Graham joked that it was just photoshop.</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew came under fire last week, when he finally addressed his relationship with the late Jeffrey Epstein<a href="http://goss.ie/news/prince-andrew-deeply-regrets-his-comments-during-newsnight-interview-190937"> during a controversial interview with Newsnight.</a></p>
      <p>During the interview, the Duke denied having a sexual relationship with Virginia Roberts Giuffre when she was 17 back in 2001.</p>
      <p>Despite his denial, the way Prince Andrew answered the interviewer’s questions sparked serious backlash – <a href="http://goss.ie/uk-showbiz/prince-andrew-officially-steps-back-from-official-royal-duties-after-car-crash-interview-191312">and he’s been forced to step down from royal duties.</a></p>
