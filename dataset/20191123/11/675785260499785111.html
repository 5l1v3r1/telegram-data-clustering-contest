      <h1>Katie Price shares old pic of her kids as Emily Atack attack backlash rages on</h1>
      <h2>Katie has come under fire after making an incredibly rude comment about Emily's alleged lack of personal hygiene</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:42:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price looks to be recycling old photos of her daughters as she attempts to distance herself from a furore following ghastly comments she made about I’m A Celeb star Emily Atack.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/katie-price">The 41-year-old former glamour model</a> shared a photo on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> of eldest daughter Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther Andre, 12, and five-year-old Bunny entertaining a pair of dogs.</p>
      <p>However it appeared the image was from a photo shoot that the ex-Loose Women star had previously shared via Instagram three days earlier.</p>
      <p>Posting the snap, Katie showed her two girls sat on a wooden fence while wearing matching parkas and hats - available to buy from the brand Katie set up in her children’s name.</p>

      <p>“Saturdays with my girls,” Katie wrote, alongside a pink heart emoji - and adding: “wearing their own range @princessandbunny.co.uk coats &amp; hats.”</p>
      <p>She added a Christmas tree emoji and a gift box emoji while adding an “Ad” hashtag to signify that the post was an advert for the Princess and Bunny brand.</p>
      <p>However, estranged husband, Kieran Hayler, 32, had previously shared a video of himself with his two children from Katie, Bunny and six-year-old son Jett, at the cinema together.</p>

      <p>Katie’s innocent looking post came less than 24-hours after she viciously lashed out at I’m A Celeb star Emily Atack, 29.</p>
      <p>In a video shared on Instagram stories which has been widely panned by fans and critics, Katie alluded to Emily’s sex life and made a vile comment about her personal hygiene.</p>
      <p>Katie’s outburst came after Emily had alluded to Katie’s own sexual health after she caught I’m A Celebrity: Extra Camp co-hosts Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas splashing around in a jungle pool where Katie had first embarked on a romance with Peter Andre 15 years earlier.</p>

      <p>"I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool," Emily joked on camera as she pulled a face.</p>
      <p>But the quip didn't land well back at home, as Katie was reportedly fuming when she heard about Emily's comments from friends.</p>
      <p>"She was telling people that she can't believe Emily would say something so snide and if she 'wants a problem, I'll give her a problem'," a source close to Katie told The Sun following the incident.</p>

      <p>The insider added: "At one point Katie was saying she'd fly out to Australia and confront her. She's not going to, obviously, but she was asking around to see if anyone had Emily's number."</p>
      <p>Indeed, some fans went as far as to accuse Katie of posting her old photo of Princess and Bunny in an effort to divert attention from the ongoing argument with Emily.</p>
      <p>One fan slammed Katie on Instagram, typing: "U lost the minute you bit back! Have some maturity and class. Dont rise to it. But for someone who has campaigned for online bullying to be a crime wtf are u doing!"</p>
