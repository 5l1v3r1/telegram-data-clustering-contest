      <h1>Peter Crouch reacts to Tottenham's "strange" Jose Mourinho appointment</h1>
      <h2>The former Tottenham forward gave his thoughts on the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino and the arrival of the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:48:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:48</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Peter Crouch has admitted that he finds the appointment of Jose Mourinho at Tottenham as "a strange fit" but added that his former club made the decision out of a determination to get into the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Tottenham sacked Mauricio Pochettino on Tueday after five-and-a-half years in charge, before acting swiftly to appoint former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss Mourinho on a three-and-a-half year deal.</p>
      <p>And Crouch - who started out at Spurs before returning for a second spell in 2009 - says that the situation his former club found themselves in this season made the appointment understandable.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think at the start of the season Spurs would have hired him," Crouch told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/daniel-levy-must-compromise-if-jose-mourinho-is-to-succeed-at-tottenham-warns-peter-crouch-11198155/">Metro</a> .</p>

      <p>"In a lot of ways… sometimes clubs are close to relegation and they get someone in that doesn’t play the way the club wants to but it’s about surviving.</p>
      <p>"I think this is a similar situation but at the top end of the league.</p>
      <p>"The situation is clear; the club need to get into the Champions League. Mourinho is not the usual fit for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> . Levy wants young players who have a resale value, that can improve and be able to improve the club.</p>
      <p>"Mourinho traditionally buys 30+ players who do the job now because he knows he’ll only be there one or two years. That’s against the philosophy of Tottenham so it’s a strange fit but it’s needs must."</p>

      <p>Despite some reservations, Crouch is backing Mourinho to do a good job ahead of his first game in charge at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I feel like they still have a top squad, they’ve got top players," he added.</p>
      <p>"This is the same team that got to the Champions League final, they can beat anyone on their day."</p>
