      <h3>The Philippine ambassador to Moscow recently met with officials of Russia’s top oil and refining company to discuss how they can export quality but cheaper energy products to Manila.</h3>
      <p>Ambassador to Russia Carlos D. Sorreta met with GAZPROM NEFT executives, led by Head of International Projects Igor Valutskiy, to discuss the energy needs of the Philippines and how GAZPROM NEFT can provide quality products at competitive prices to the Philippines.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, GAZPROM NEFT, one of Russia’s top oil and refining companies, showed its interest in partnering with Philippine independent oil firms to bring Russian fuel, oil, and lubricants to the country on a competitive basis.</p>
      <p>“We are always looking for opportunities to bring the price of energy down for Philippine consumers and partnering with GAZPROM NEFT may be such an opportunity, not only in lowering energy costs but also in establishing stable and secure supply sources,” said Sorreta, agreeing to link GAZPROM NEFT with Philippine independent oil firms.</p>
      <p>Energy cooperation was one of the issues taken up during the recent visit to Russia by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte who discussed this matter with Russian government officials and energy companies.</p>
      <p>Sorreta said he will get in touch with concerned Philippine Government agencies on their discussion during the meeting with GAZPROM NEFT officials about the possible exchange of technology in the areas of refining and tapping depleted oil fields. </p>
      <p>Also discussed were GAZPROM NEFT products used in the construction industry, including road building.</p>
