      <h1>Tesco shoppers 'boycott' store after it bans cat who has been long-time regular</h1>
      <h2>Pumpkin the cat has been banned from his local Tesco by staff who labelled him a 'hindrance', sparking anger from his fans</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:57:29+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>Shoppers have vowed to boycott a Tesco Express store in solidarity with a cat who was banned from the shop despite being a long-time regular.</p>
      <p>Pumpkin had been well-known for regularly strolling into the store and having a snooze on the tills, becoming a favourite with many of its customers.</p>
      <p>But the ginger cat has now been handed a 'ban' from the store with some members of staff labelling him a 'hindrance and a pain'.</p>
      <p>Angered customers have pledged to 'boycott' the store in Drayton, Norwich, in support of Pumpkin, who also pops into the local pub from time-to-time.</p>

      <p>Store leader Andrew Tabiner said: "The cat is banned and we are doing our best to show it the door.</p>
      <p>"The bottom line is it should not be in the store, as it is not Tesco policy, and we are doing everything we can to discourage it from coming in.</p>
      <p>"It is absolutely not a shop pet."</p>
      <p>It is thought Pumpkin is often fed outside the shop and Andrew added he believes the moggy enjoys the warmth of the store.</p>
      <p>The move has angered fans of the 'local celebrity' who took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> to vent their frustration at the decision.</p>

      <p>One wrote: "Not sure how you can 'ban' a cat from anywhere, particularly a cat who is clearly very streetwise since he is a rescue who lived on the streets for years?!</p>
      <p>"Everyone loves him around here and with good reason."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Poor pumpkin. He is such a character. I think his supporters should boycott Tesco."</p>
      <p>Not everyone was against the ban, with one arguing: "I agree Pumpkin is a lovely cat but I also agree that animals shouldn't be in food shops."</p>
      <p>His owner, Jo Harding, says they live about 100 yards from a row of shops including a beauticians, pub and estate agent, but Tesco is his favourite.</p>
      <p>"He's no bother I think he just wants a bit of attention off people," she said.</p>
      <p>"He was a street cat before we had him so he is very street wise and Tesco is where he spends most of his time.</p>

      <p>"He's been going in there for 18 months now and I know the staff all love him so I'm not sure why he's being stopped after so long.</p>
      <p>"He mainly lies by the door- he's like a security guard."</p>
      <p>Jo said she has been 'amazed' by the support for six-year-old Pumpkin, who has more than 300 friends on his own Facebook page from as far as Canada and Norway.</p>
      <p>"People were saying they were boycotting Tesco, it's just gone a bit mental," she added.</p>
      <p>"I just can't believe the overwhelming support we've had.</p>
      <p>"We knew he was well-loved in the community but not to this level. The community spirit was just amazing.</p>
      <p>"I appreciate that cats aren't usually meant to be in shops but I can't stop him unless I keep him in which would be unfair on him.</p>
      <p>"God forbid if anything happens to him the community will be devastated"</p>
      <p>Pumpkin lives with Jo, her husband Lee, daughter Abbie, and granddaughter Ameila, as well as seven other cats and dogs.</p>
      <p>A Tesco spokesperson said: "Although we love the little ginger cat who visits Acres Way Express a food store isn't the best place for a cat to be, so our colleagues gently encourage him to go out when he tries to come in."</p>
