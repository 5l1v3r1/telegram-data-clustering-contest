      <p>PUTRAJAYA, Nov 23 — Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has not made his mind up yet on whether or not Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim will be part of his revamped Cabinet line-up.</p>
      <p>He told a press conference today after a post mortem meeting with the Pakatan Harapan Presidential Council over their recent Tanjung Piai defeat that “everything is possible”.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t made a decision yet (on Anwar). Everything is possible,” he said.</p>
      <p>Touching on the sentiments of his current line up and whether or not they were unhappy with the reshuffle, Dr Mahathir said the ministers seem to have taken it stoically.</p>
      <p>“Well, they are not against it. They didn’t say please don’t reshuffle me,” he said.</p>
