        <b>Nigerian rapper, Zlatan Ibile, caused quite a buzz on social media following his response to a fan who had just gotten admission into school and begged him for money to pay his school fees.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Being in the spotlight often comes with a lot of perks but the position as many have come to realize, is not without its downsides. More often than not, celebrities are faced with numerous request of financial help from their fans.</p>
      <p>While some make it a habit of doing giveaways, their help can only reach so many people. Just recently, a fan of Zlatan, asked him for financial assistance to pay his school fees as he had just gotten admission to study in Yabatech after 6 years of waiting.</p>
      <p>Zlatan's response however, was far from what the fan had expected. Replying to the tweet, the rapper wrote: <i>"May be God no want make you go school! Me sef no finish."</i></p>
