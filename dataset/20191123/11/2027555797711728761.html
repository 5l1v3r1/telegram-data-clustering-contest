      <p>Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Saturday questioned the morality of revoking the President's rule and swearing-in of the chief minister and deputy chief minister in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Gehlot said both the chief minister and deputy chief minister were "guilt conscious" and raised a doubt whether they would be able to deliver good governance.</p>
      <p>Referring to the political development in Maharashtra, Gehlot asked what morality was there in the sudden revocation of President's rule and such swearing-in.</p>
      <p>"Which direction are they taking democracy to?" Gehlot asked on Twitter, adding that people would teach a lesson to the BJP on an appropriate time.</p>
      <p>Gehlot said he was doubtful whether Devendra Fadnavis would be successful as a chief minister and deliver good governance, adding that the people of Maharashtra would suffer.Â </p>
