      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>According to Reelgood, Apple TV+ shows <i>See</i> and <i>The Morning Show</i> broke its top 20 for the first time.</li>
        <li>They came in a number 11 and 12 respectively for the week of 13-19 November.</li>
        <li>Disney+'s <i>The Mandalorian</i> came in at no. 1.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A report suggests that Apple TV+ shows <i>See</i> and <i>The Morning Show</i> broke into Reelgood's top 20 most-watched series for the first time.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/22/most-watched-tv-shows-disney-plus-netflix-other-streamers/">BGR:</a></p>
      <blockquote>As they do each week, the folks at streaming search engine Reelgood take a look at user activity on the service, including what people are watching the most of, and use that data to compile a list of the most-binged series from week-to-week. And for the first time, the week's data from November 13 to November 19 includes the two new streamers we mentioned above from Disney and Apple.</blockquote>
      <p>As far as Apple TV+ is concerned, flagship shows <i>See</i> and <i>The Morning Show</i> came it at number 11 and 12 respectively, just behind <i>Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan</i> and <i>The Crown</i>. Disney+'s highly touted ' <i>The Mandalorian</i> came in at number one.</p>
      <p>The news will hopefully come as encouragement to Apple as it looks to get its new streaming service off the ground. Several of its shows have been met with mixed reception, in particular, <i>The Morning Show</i>, which received mostly poor reviews prior to release. The show's producers claim that many of those were just <a href="https://www.imore.com/producers-apple-tvs-morning-show-say-early-poor-reviews-were-just-haters-wanting-apple-fail">"haters wanting Apple to fail"</a>, the show's demand seen here and more widespread positive reviews on sites like Rotten Tomatoes may well suggest that the show is proving to be more popular with wider audiences than it was with critics.</p>
