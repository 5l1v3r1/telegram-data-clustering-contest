      <p>The makers of Naga Chaitanya – Sekhar Kammula film have released a small video titled The World of #NC19 on the occasion of the actor’s Birthday. The video essentially introduces Naga Chaitanya’s character in the film. It looks like Naga Chaitanya will be seen as a lower-middle-class man and his looks similar to that of his matured look in his recent hit film, Majili.</p>
      <p>The actor is seen wearing worn-out clothes, sweating while sweeping the floor, saving money and having fun with the neighboring kids.
