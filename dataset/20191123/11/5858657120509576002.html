      <p>NEW DELHI — Hundreds of students and activists in India’s capital have sung, danced and chanted anti-government slogans as they marched to protest against increased student housing fees at a public university.</p>
      <p>During Saturday’s protest in New Delhi, the students chanted slogans such as “Fight, fight, fight for your right to study” and “Keep fighting, keep dying.”</p>
      <p>The protest took a jovial turn from last week, when several students clashed with police, sustained injuries, and were detained and charged for destroying public property.</p>
      <p>The initial protests last week were mainly by students from Jawaharlal Nehru University, where a new hostel manual aims to increase rent for a single-bed room to more than $8 per month from less than $1 per month earlier. The security deposit more than doubled to more than $160.</p>
