      <h3>The results:</h3>
      <p>Philadelphia 115, San Antonio 104; LA Clippers 122, Houston 119; Dallas 143, Cleveland 101; Brooklyn 116, Sacramento 97; Denver 96, Boston 92; Utah 113, Golden State 109;  Miami 116, Chicago 108; LA Lakers 130, Oklahoma City 127; Detroit 128, Atlanta 103; Washington 125, Charlotte 118</p>
      <p>LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Kawhi Leonard nailed the go-ahead basket with just 15 seconds remaining to lift the Los Angeles Clippers to an entertaining 122-119 win over the Houston Rockets on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Leonard finished with 24 points and six rebounds, while Paul George had 19 points and eight rebounds for the Clippers, who won their fourth consecutive game.</p>
      <p>“It feels great. We are trying to build something,” Leonard said. “We made a few little mistakes in the first half, but we ended up closing it out in the fourth though.”</p>
      <p>Clippers’ Lou Williams scored all 26 of his points in the second half in front of a crowd of 19,000 at Staples Center arena.</p>
      <p>James Harden had 37 points, 12 assists and eight rebounds for the Rockets, who have lost their last two games after going on an eight-game winning streak.  </p>
      <p>Williams gave the Clippers a 118-117 lead with 30 seconds remaining by draining a three point shot. Harden then made two free throws to restore Houston’s lead, 119-118, with 22 seconds to go.</p>
      <p>After Leonard’s bucket, George helped clinch it by making two free throws with one second on the clock.</p>
      <p>It was the first meeting between Houston’s Russell Westbrook and George. They played two seasons together with the Oklahoma City Thunder before George left to join the Clippers.</p>
      <p>The Thunder dealt Westbrook to the Rockets a short time later.</p>
      <p>Westbrook scored 22 points but he missed a three point attempt late in the game which would have given the Rockets a shot at victory.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, LeBron James had 23 points and Anthony Davis made four clutch free throws in the final 10 seconds as the Los Angeles Lakers pulled out a 130-127 win over the Oklahoma City on Friday.</p>
      <p>Davis finished with a team-high 33 points and 11 rebounds, but it was his free throw shooting that helped the Lakers seal the victory over the struggling Thunder.  </p>
      <p>Chris Paul made a layup with 11 seconds remaining to get the Thunder to within 126-125 before Davis made a pair of free throws to put the Lakers up by three with eight seconds left.</p>
