      <p>Slamming the new government in Maharashtra as "illegitimate", the Congress on Saturday termed the swearing-in of Bharatiya Janata Party's Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister a black chapter in India's democracy, saying the saffron party acted as the "contract killer" of the democracy.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that the BJP threatened Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar into joining hands with the saffron party to form the government in Maharashtra.</p>

      <p>He alleged that Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari did not make effort to verify Devendra Fadnavis' claims of having the support of a majority of MLAs before administering the chief minister's oath to him.</p>
      <p>Calling Ajit Pawar "opportunist", Randeep Singh Surjewala said the BJP "threatened" the NCP leader who has joined hands with the saffron party, acted as "contract killer" of democracy, and "robbed" Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>"Devendra Fadnavis had promised to put Ajit Pawar in jail but has made him the deputy chief minister now," Randeep Surjewala said, adding, "Modi hai toh mumkin hai [It is possible if PM Modi is there]"</p>
      <p>Attacking the Governor, the Congress spokesperson said Bhagat Singh Koshyari turned into Home Minister Amit Shah's "hitman". "PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are behind the early morning coup," he said.</p>
      <p>He further asked why no media was invited by the Governor for Devendra Fadnavis' swearing-in ceremony. "Why wasn't the media invited by the Governor for the oath-taking ceremony. Why was such a level of secrecy maintained? Only a private agency and the government's media DD were called for the oath-taking ceremony," Randeep Surjewala said.</p>
      <p>"Governor of Maharashtra met Devendra Fadnavis at night and by 5:47 am, President's Rule in the state was withdrawn. For that, we have a protocol," the Congress said.</p>
      <p>The party spokesperson also said that it is looking for legal ways to deal with the Maharashtra developments. "All options are open including a legal way. We are taking advice from our experts. Let's see what they suggest."</p>
      <p>"Our MLAs are very loyal to us. Amit Shah can't put their dignity and honestly on sale," Randeep Surjewala concluded.</p>
