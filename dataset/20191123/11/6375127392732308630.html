      <h1>Lady Bulldogs keep cage crown unbeaten</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:30:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/theodore-p-jurado" target="_blank">Theodore P. Jurado</a></address>
      <p>NATIONAL University proved too much to University of Santo Tomas, 66-54, to extend its unbeatable reign to six years yesterday in the UAAP women’s basketball tournament at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>The Lady Bulldogs dedicated the win to Jack Danielle Animam, who could not make it back home after sustaining an eye injury in New Zealand while representing the Gilas Pilipinas women’s team in the Fiba Asia Olympic qualifying tournament. </p>
      <p>Animam, who averaged 15 points and 12.4 boards this season, ended up as champion in her final year, being one of the pillars of NU’s dynastic rule.</p>
      <p>Extending their perfect run to 96 games, the title win  was not a cakewalk for the Lady Bulldogs, who encountered rough patches - including the absence of Animam in the entire championship series.</p>
      <p>“Overwhelming. Overjoyed. Sobrang happy with everything. Hindi ko ini-expect na having this run. Six titles in six years without any losses. So happy for the school and for the players. I’m happy that I am part of this and hopefully we can do it again next year,” said NU mentor Pat Aquino.</p>
      <p>“It has been an up and down season. I’m just happy we finished the job and getting that win,” he added. </p>
      <p>In her final collegiate game, Monique Del Carmen rose to the occassion for the Lady Bulldogs with 15 points, four assists, two steals and two rebounds en route in winning the Finals MVP award.</p>
      <p>Kaye Pingol also scored 15 points, five boards, two assists and two steals, while Congo’s Rhena Itesi had 12 points, eight boards, three steals and three assists for NU.</p>
      <p>Unlike in last Wednesday’s 70-65 series-opening win, the Lady Bulldogs were in control early, racing to a 30-10 lead.</p>
      <p>The Tigresses were only able to get into the groove in the second and third quarter, keeping themselves in the game at 36-46 heading into the payoff period.</p>
      <p>The scores:</p>
      <p>NU (66) — Pingol 15, Del Carmen 15, Itesi 12, Hayes 9, Cacho 7, Canuto 3, Clarin 3, Surada 2, Bartolo 0, Cac 0, Fabruada 0, Goto 0, Harada 0.</p>
      <p>UST (54) — Ferrer 16, Irebu 11, Portillo 7, Soriano 6, Panti 5, Tacatac 4, Callangan 3, Rivera 2, Gandalla 0, Gonzales 0, Javier 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 25-8, 36-23, 46-36, 66-54</p>
