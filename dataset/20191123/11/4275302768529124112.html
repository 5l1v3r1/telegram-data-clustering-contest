      <p>The alarm was raised at around 12.35am when police received reports about a man being in possession of some sort of weapon – described as a crossbow – in Broomhead Drive.</p>
      <p>Armed officers and an ambulance attended, and surrounding roads were cordoned off in a bid to minimise any potential danger.</p>
      <p>However, it soon emerged that the ‘weapon’ in question had been a toy crossbow which had been given to an 18-year-old man as a gift earlier that evening.</p>
      <p>A Police Scotland spokeswoman confirmed: “Around 12.35 am on Saturday November 23 2019, police received a report of a male in possession of a cross bow in Broomhead Drive, Dunfermline.</p>
      <p>“Police attended and it was established that the item in question was actually a toy crossbow.</p>
      <p>“Advice was given and no further police action taken.”</p>
