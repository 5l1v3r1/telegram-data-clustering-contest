      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> is rumoured to be one of the headliners for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/glastonbury/">Glastonbury</a> 2020 after festival boss Michael Eavis hinted there will be a female artist on the line-up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/paul-mccartney/">Paul McCartney</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/paul-mccartney-got-brian-mays-blessing-accepting-glastonbury-amid-badger-cull-drama-11203966/"> has already been confirmed as the Pyramid Stage headliner</a> for Saturday, and Michael confirmed there will be a big female star announced soon.</p>
      <p>He told BBC Somerset: ‘I’ve got two of my favourite headliners already booked […] I can’t tell you the second one, you would love her to bits, everybody does, but no names at the moment…”</p>
      <p>Fans have started to suspect it may be Taylor as she does have a gap in her tour schedule across the Glastonbury weekend, performing a show in Norway on 26 June and then her next scheduled show is on 1 July in Denmark.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury runs from 24 – 28 June next year, so that would put her in the running for a performance on the Saturday or Sunday of the festival.</p>

      <p>As Paul’s been confirmed to headline Saturday, if Taylor does indeed get confirmed, it’s likely she will headline the Pyramid Stage on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the legendary music festival, though Michael admitted it would be hard to top this year’s show.</p>

      <p>He admitted: ‘It can’t be better than this year, can it? It would be very difficult to do better than it was this year.’</p>
      <p>Taylor is currently the bookies’ number two choice for headliner, with Kendrick Lamar being the favourite to be announced for this year’s show.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/scooter-braun-finally-speaks-toxic-division-taylor-swift-following-record-label-row-11198701/">She is currently embroiled in a feud with Scooter Braun</a> over the rights to her back catalogue of songs after the music mogul bought her record label, Big Machine, earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping they sort it out before Glasto – fans will be wanting to hear the classics if she does indeed get confirmed.</p>
