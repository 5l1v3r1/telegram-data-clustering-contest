        <li>50g whole blanched hazelnuts, toasted for 12-15 minutes</li>
        <li>A small knob of butter</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the praline Chantilly</b>

      <ul>
        <li>500ml double cream</li>
        <li>50g praline paste, plus extra for garnish</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD </h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 195C/175C fan/Gas 5½ and line a heavy baking tray with greaseproof paper.</li>
        <li>To make the choux pastry, place the water and butter in a pan with the salt and sugar and bring to the boil. Whisk in the flour and cook for four or five minutes over a medium heat, until the mixture starts to come away from the pan side.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment and mix until steam stops coming off the mix (it’s very important to have the mix at the correct temperature).</li>
        <li>Slowly add the eggs one by one while mixing to obtain a dropping consistency which will still hold its shape when piped.</li>
        <li>Put the mixture into a piping bag with a 2cm plain nozzle and pipe onto the lined tray four thick rings 9cm in diameter. or six at 6cm in diameter. Brush each one with egg wash and scatter them with flaked almonds.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 minutes until lightly golden, then turn the tray and bake for a further 10 to 15 minutes until crisp to the touch. Set aside on a wire rack and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>For the caramelised nuts, sprinkle the caster sugar into a hot pan little by little and cook (without stirring) to a light golden caramel.</li>
        <li>Add the hazelnuts and stir well, and continue to cook to a dark golden caramel. Stir in the butter then, working quickly, spread the nuts out on greaseproof paper and allow to cool.</li>
        <li> Whip the cream and praline paste to soft peaks, being very, very careful not to overwhip, place in a piping bag and refrigerate until required.</li>
        <li>To assemble the desserts, carefully slice each choux pastry ring in half horizontally. Pipe praline Chantilly on to four halves, dot on a little more praline paste and scatter with the hazelnuts. Top with the other choux pastry lids. Dust with icing sugar and eat immediately.</li>
