      <h1>Beermen, Aces fight for dear lives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:28:06+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/arman-carandang" target="_blank">Arman Carandang</a></address>
      <h3>ONE of the toughest challenges for a team seeking a semifinal spot is if it is pitted against a powerhouse team.</h3>
      <p>That’s the situation now for Barangay Ginebra which will play sister team and grandslam-seeking San Miguel Beer at the start of the quarterfinal round in the 2019 PBA Governors’ Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum.</p>
      <p>“We certainly would have chosen a different opponent for the quarterfinals if it was within our power, but SMB it is,” said Gin Kings coach Tim Cone.</p>
      <p>“Control what you can control, and that is preparing ourselves the best we can,” added Cone.</p>
      <p>The Gin Kings and the Beermen meet in the 6:45 p.m. main offering of an explosive Sunday double-header that will also see Meralco collide with Alaska in the curtain-raiser at 4:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>“It is such always a great challenge going against them (Beermen). Both teams are extremely motivated. It should be a great fight,” stressed Cone.</p>
      <p>The Gin Kings finished within magic four at 7-4, thus earning the luxury of winning only once – which they could do it today —  to make the semis right away.</p>
      <p>With the Gin Kings in the magic four are NLEX (8-3), no. 2 Meralco (8-3) and third seed Talk ‘N  Text. The four have to win only once to advance to the next round.</p>
      <p>The Bolts meanwhile are also expecting a tough fight against the Aces, who won all their last four outings in the elimination round to finish 7th at 5-6.</p>
      <p>“With the elimination now over, our total concentration is on reaching the semis. Alaska has been playing good basketball so we are expecting a tough challenge,” said Meralco coach Norman Black.</p>
      <p>Black is particularly wary of the Aces’ vaunted strong start which could have catapulted the team to the playoff round after a 0-5 start in the elims.</p>
      <p>“We need to be ready for the fact that they have been thriving with early offense and a strong team defense,” said Black.  </p>
      <p>“On our end, we just want to continue to execute and play the type of basketball that has gotten us to this point,” added Black.</p>
      <p>The other half of the quarterfinals pitting top seed NLEX against NorthPort and Talk ‘N Text against Magnolia will be played on Monday also at the Big Dome.</p>
