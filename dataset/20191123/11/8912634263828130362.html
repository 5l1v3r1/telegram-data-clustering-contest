      <p>BEIRUT: A car bomb killed nine people including four civilians in a Turkish-held border town in northern Syria on Saturday, a Britain-based war monitor said.<br/>Two children were among those killed in Tal Abyad, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.<br/>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.<br/>The area has been shaken by repeated such bombings since Turkish troops and their Syrian proxies seized a strip of border land including Tal Abyad from Kurdish forces in a cross-border operation last month.<br/>The Turkish invasion against Kurdish-controlled areas saw Ankara’s fighters seize a strip of land roughly 120 kilometers long and 30 kilometers deep on the Syrian side of the border.<br/>The operation launched on October 9 displaced tens of thousands and left dozens of civilians dead, and forced Kurdish forces to retreat from some key towns.<br/>On November 10, Turkey blamed Kurdish fighters for another bombing that took the lives of eight people in the village of Suluk southeast of Tal Abyad.<br/>A week earlier, another car bomb killed 13 people in Tal Abyad, according to the Observatory.<br/>Syria’s Kurds have been a key ally of the US in fighting Daesh militants in Syria, but Turkey sees them as “terrorists” linked to a Kurdish insurgency at home.<br/>Kurdish-led Syrian forces expelled Daesh from its last patch of land in March, but the militia have continued to claim deadly attacks.</p>
