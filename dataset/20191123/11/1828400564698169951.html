      <h2>Jim Bentley’s focus is getting his AFC Fylde side away from a relegation battle before they contemplate having an impact towards the other end of the table.</h2>

      <p>The Coasters were tipped for promotion – if not the National League title – at the start of the season but find themselves just two points outside the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Bentley is still less than a month into his new role as the Coasters’ boss, but is enjoying his time at Mill Farm.</p>
      <p>He said: “They’re a good group to work with, they’re working hard, they take on board information and it’s about improving.</p>
      <p>“People say about whether it’s too late to make a push for the play-offs and this, that, and the other.</p>
      <p>“First and foremost we’re in a tricky position and we need to pull ourselves away from that sooner rather than later and then assess ourselves as we go along.</p>
      <p>“Confidence is a big part in football, it’s been a part of why the team are where they are at the moment.</p>
      <p>“All those things are what we’re working on to try and make ourselves better – whether it be physically, mentally, tactically, technically; all areas of the game you need to cover.</p>
      <p>“We’re seeing good signs that we’re pleased with. Credit where credit’s due in that regard.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we’ll continue to improve and put points on the board.”</p>
      <p>Bentley also wants to foster a positive, uplifting environment at Mill Farm and sees similarities to his former Morecambe players in his current squad.</p>
      <p>“We’re about honesty, respect and hard work, creating a good environment for the players to learn and work hard,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got good evidence of that at our previous club of developing players and getting players back on track that have lost their way, taking players from non-league or building them up after injuries and getting them back up the levels.”</p>
