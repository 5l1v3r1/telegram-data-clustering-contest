      <p>If there’s one thing (apart from the cost) that sucks about buying a day ticket to go skiing, it’s the fact that you have to wait in line twice: to purchase your ticket, and then to wait for the lift.</p>

      <p>That headache could be dramatically reduced this year, as Whistler Blackcomb (WB) is adopting a new technology that promises to dramatically cut down on ticket purchasing lines.</p>
      <p>Employees at all three of the mountain’s bases will carry a device that allows them to process lift tickets that do not require photo identification.</p>
      <p>“With this hand-held device, we have the capability to fulfill a guest’s order away from a ticket window,” explained Wynn Pringle, scanning manager for Whistler Blackcomb.</p>
      <p>“It allows us to be a little bit more free and mobile.”</p>
      <p>The Express Lift Ticket Program will see certain staff members carry the devices, which allow them to process transactions as well as honour pre-purchased tickets.</p>
      <p>According to Pringle, the system is extremely efficient. “We have the capability of fulfilling their orders within 20 seconds,” he said. “It’s extremely quick.”</p>
      <p>If the device sounds familiar, it’s because last winter Whistler Blackcomb (along with Keystone Resort and Breckenridge Ski Resort) took part in a trial run of the technology.</p>
      <p>Pringle said the experience was so positive the resort decided to continue using it through the summer.</p>
      <p>Miriam MacDonald, director of product sales and services for WB, said that the company is always looking at ways to reduce the amount of time that visitors spend in lineups, and that this technology has been warmly embraced by clients and staff alike.</p>
      <p>“From a guest services point of view, we’re always looking to enhance the guest experience,” she said. “The more we shorten the time guests are waiting in our lineups—be it ticket window or rental store—the more time they’re able to spend on the hill.”</p>
      <p>Marc Riddell, WB’s communications director, noted that the device won’t work for people looking to collect season’s passes or EDGE Cards.</p>
      <p>“This particular program is really focused at those casual skiers that may not be in tune to our pre-commitment model, and then decide to either ski one or two days a year,” said Riddell, noting that, pre-purchasing lift tickets through WB’s website can save visitors up to 50 per cent off.</p>
