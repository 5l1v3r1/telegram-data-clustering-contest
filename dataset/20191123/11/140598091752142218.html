      <p>Frank Lampard’s faith in Chelsea’s young players and a vibrant, attacking tactical setup has helped the club climb to third in the table, with stubborn defences unable to hold out against a team determined to always score one more than their opponents. It could hardly have gone better so far.</p>
      <p>For all the entertainment Chelsea have provided going forward, how they defend against Manchester City on Saturday evening is absolutely crucial. Pep Guardiola’s side will be seeking vengeance from their Liverpool defeat and are lethal on the counter-attack - something Chelsea's style of play leaves them vulnerable to.</p>
      <p>Nominally a 4-2-3-1, Chelsea’s full-backs get high and wide as the forwards attack in a flat four across the top, stacking one side of the pitch to overload the opposition full-back and centre-back in a three vs two. </p>
      <p>Loading the attack in this way helps create gaps between opposition defenders, freeing up space for passing options.</p>

      <p>The split of a three and a one across the front forces defenders one v one, while if the full-back joins in, Chelsea gain numerical superiority, causing the back line to split to deal with the danger. The wide player on the opposite side maintains his position to further stretch the gap and that allows forwards to ghost into scoring situations unmarked.</p>

        <figcaption>How Chelsea's attacking shape helps create gaps in the defence</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The problem is that the two midfielders sat deeper have a gigantic part of the pitch to defend if there is a turnover in possession. This has gone unpunished against weaker teams trapped deep in their own half, like Crystal Palace were, but Manchester United already showed where the cracks are in a 4-0 win.</p>
      <p>By trying to force scoring opportunities, Chelsea leave the rest of the pitch wide open to any team who can counter at pace.</p>

      <p>Jorginho and N’Golo Kante are the midfield pair and the latter is perfect for pinballing around the centre of the pitch to snuff out counter-attacks, but if Kante hunts, Jorginho patrols. The worry is that if the play goes beyond Kante, Chelsea’s defence are suddenly in a lot of trouble. </p>
      <p>Chelsea build play far quicker under Lampard than Maurizio Sarri but Jorginho is still heavily involved in everything, making 75.2 passes per game this season as opposed to 78.6 last.</p>
      <p>His contribution to approach play has improved, with 1.09 chances created per match instead of 0.8, and he’s even provided two assists (as opposed to zero last season), but despite making more interceptions and tackles, Jorginho cannot defend an entire third of a pitch on his own. He is a deep-lying playmaker, not a ball-winner.</p>
      <p>Guardiola may plan to isolate Jorginho so that his team can counter Lampard’s and exploit the space around him. Matteo Kovacic, a tidy passer capable of wriggling out of tight spaces, could be brought in as a replacement for Jorginho because of this, or possibly even in a midfield three at the expense of Mason Mount or Christian Pulisic as seen against Liverpool in a 2-1 defeat. </p>
      <p>Essentially, Lampard must decide to stick with what has worked thus far or twist, and try to contain a determined, wounded Manchester City, but this is where his inexperience as a manager might actually prove a big advantage - Guardiola’s team cannot analyse that without precedent. </p>
      <p>If Chelsea do not adjust their style of play to Saturday’s challenge accordingly, there is a high likelihood they will be torn apart repeatedly in transition. Then again, perhaps sticking to what they do best is exactly how to record a famous win.</p>
