      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> might be roughing it in the I’m A Celebrity jungle, but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-a-celebrity-all-the-girls-aloud-drama-as-nadine-coyle-rubbishes-cheryl-feud-rumours-as-fake-news-11193321/">the same can’t be said for her Girls Aloud bandmates</a>.</p>
      <p>In fact, Cheryl and Nicola Roberts were on hand to celebrate Kimberley Walsh’s 38th birthday with a wild night at Bagatelle, in London.</p>
      <p>Thanks for the invite…</p>
      <p>The Fight For This Love singer, 36, was spotted arriving at the swanky restaurant, rocking a black leather top, coupled with dark orange trousers.</p>
      <p>She completed the look with a patterned scarf and a pair of giant triangle earrings we never knew we needed.</p>
      <p>While birthday girl Kimberley was a walking glitterball in a sparkly mini-dress, and strappy silver heels.</p>
      <p>And Nicola, 34, stunned in a black and white checked blazer and matching skirt, on top of a black lace bralet.</p>

      <p>We are absolutely not worthy of the Love Machine singers.</p>

      <p>Sarah Harding didn’t appear to join the trio – who had a wild night out at the bash.</p>
      <p>In a clip shared on Cheryl’s Instagram story, Kimberley could be seen looking a little delicate as she appeared to take a shot.</p>
      <p>And another video showed the Strictly Come Dancing star being presented with a huge cake and sparklers, before they all headed straight to the dancefloor.</p>

      <p>And we’re not at all jealous of their night out.</p>
      <p>However, it wasn’t all fun and games for the Sound Of The Underground singers, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/cheryl-denies-voting-for-voting-girls-aloud-bandmate-nadine-coyle-to-do-im-a-celebrity-trials-11205070/">who were forced to hit back at claims they had been voting for Nadine</a> to undertake all of the Bush Tucker trials on I’m A Celeb.</p>
      <p>In fact, Chezza insisted there was nothing but ‘love’ for the ITV star.</p>

      <p>‘We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other,’ she told MailOnline.</p>
      <p>‘We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch,’ Kimberley added.</p>
      <p>‘I think she’s doing great in there.’</p>
      <p>So that’s that, then.</p>
