      <p>Nigerian rapper, CDQ, was recently slammed on social media over comments about Teddy A and Bambam’s wedding which many termed as insensitive.</p>
      <p>The <i>2018 BBNaija</i> lovebirds, Teddy A and Bambam, last Saturday had a star-studded wedding in Dubai, UAE with some of the big names in the Nigerian entertainment scene in attendance.</p>
      <p>CDQ wrote, “Kai but this geh lucky sha, me wey dey think say na from Kardashian’s family my guy go marry with all the swaggggg (sic).”</p>
      <p>The rapper was immediately criticised by Nigerians on social media, with many of them describing the comments as uncalled for. Subsequently, CDQ apologised and said he expected everyone to detect a note of sarcasm in the message.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Saturday Beats, the ‘Flex’ singer disclosed the reason why he tendered the apology.</p>
      <p>He said, “The person I was talking to (Teddy A) had the sense of humour to understand the sarcasm. I only apologised to those that didn’t get the message and had to make them understand that there was no negativity (in it). It is normal for people to have reacted that way. We all have different levels of understanding.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he would be getting rid of his dreadlocks anytime soon, he said, “I am not sure about that, however, change is inevitable.”</p>
