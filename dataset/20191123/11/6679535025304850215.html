      <p>France’s defense minister criticised the U.S. on Saturday over what she described as “unanswered” attacks in recent months threatening the Persian Gulf, warning that the decades-long American deterrence in the oil-rich region appeared to be losing its power.</p>
      <p>Florence Parly separately said France “deplored” both U.S. President Donald Trump’s unilateral withdrawal of America from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that led to the re-imposition of crushing sanctions, as well as Tehran recently breaking the deal’s enrichment, stockpile and centrifuge limits.</p>
      <p>While saying France would continue to talk to Iran, her speech before the annual Manama Dialogue in Bahrain struck a muscular tone for Paris, which maintains a naval base in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
      <p>She said France would push for a European-organised maritime security force in the region that would cooperate with but be separate from an American-organized force.</p>
      <p>“We’ve seen deliberate, gradual U.S. disengagement,” she said at the summit organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p>
      <p>“It had been in the cards for a while but it became clear when fighter jets remained on the tarmac in 2013 after the Syrian chemical attacks or later, after the downing of a U.S. UAV and the bombing Saudi oil facilities.”</p>
      <p>“With the cornerstone moving, the edifice has started shaking,” she said.</p>
      <p>Since the summer, there have been a series of attacks in the region, starting first with the suspected mining of oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz.</p>
      <p>Iran did shoot down a U.S. military surveillance drone and seize oil tankers.</p>
      <p>A September drone-and-cruise-missile attack on Saudi oil fields halved the kingdom’s crude oil production, shocking energy markets.</p>
      <p>The U.S. blames that attack on Iran as well, something Iran denies.</p>
      <p>Yemen’s Houthi rebels claimed the attack, but analysts say the weapons used likely would not have the range to reach the sites from rebel-held territory and appeared to come in from the north of the Persian Gulf, not from the south toward Yemen.</p>
      <p>“When the mining of ships went unanswered, a drone got shot (down). When that in turn went unanswered, major oil facilities were bombed,” Ms. Parly said.</p>
      <p>“This is dangerous, even for those who think they gain. Because bold is never far from daring and daring never far from reckless.”</p>
