      <blockquote>I slapped a conductor this evening and i didn’t know violence can be oddly satisfying. I wasn’t even afraid of whether he would slap me back or not I was just in so much pains.<br/><br/>So I was coming from an event and I boarded a bus heading to my destination as I was already feeling so much pains in my leg from standing for a while at the bustop.<br/><br/>When i entered the conductor charged more than the usual fare but I was too tired to even wait so I entered.<br/><br/>He first started with the stupid woran woran conductors do. I wasn’t even bothered as my legs were hurting badly so I rested my head on my hands and told myself I can still bear the pain till I get home. There was usual traffic but I know the front was free, I checked the map.<br/><br/>So after leaving the traffic area the conductor kept on wasting our time at different bustops because I dunno why you would hike prices when there’s no more traffic.<br/>Waz my own I was in pains so I kept my thoughts to myself as I just wanted to get home.<br/><br/>2 bustops away from my stop be wanted to pick a man that had so much load that won’t even fit the booth of his bus. He now wanted to put it underneath my leg I told him I can’t currently move my leg that he should find somewhere else to put it but as usual he didn’t listen.<br/><br/>That’s how he shifted the leg that was hurting me the most with force. Omo I don’t know where the energy came from or what came over me I slapped him 😩😩.<br/>If someone had slapped me that way I would be shocked 😂.<br/><br/>Everybody was stunned that how the idiot now started saying I got my leg pains from having too much sex 😂😂 I told him if he continued blabbing nonsense I would slap him again.<br/><br/>Lmao I was angrily in pains mehn.<br/>He kept quiet till I got to my bustop Sha.<br/><br/>I just didn’t know what came over me. I felt bad after I came down from the bus sha.<br/>Imagine I tried that in Oshodi 😭😭 them for beat my life.<br/><br/>Anyways y’all I’m not that violent Sha 😩😩 I’m just in pains.<br/><br/>Thank You for reading my story<br/><br/>It actually happened Sha. From Berger to Ibafo. ✌️<br/><br/>Please follow me when you get to this point of the thread. Thank You.<br/><br/>I’m actually a nice person.</blockquote>
