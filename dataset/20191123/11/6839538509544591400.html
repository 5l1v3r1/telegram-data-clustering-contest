      <p>The fallout from Prince Andrew’s car crash interview with the BBC has continued, with Meghan said to be “horrified”</p>
      <p>In one of the many lowlights of the Prince’s car-crash interview with the BBC, he was asked if he had ever had sex with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s 17-year-old sex slave Virginia Roberts.</p>
      <p>“No, and without putting too fine a point on it, if you’re a man it is a positive act to have sex with somebody,” Andrew replied.</p>

      <p>“You have to take some sort of positive action and so therefore if you try to forget it’s very difficult to try and forget a positive action and I do not remember anything.”</p>
      <p>Meghan was said to be “horrified” and “troubled” by the response, according to <i>The Telegraph</i>.</p>

      <p>Meghan — who works with a charity to support female sexual abuse survivors — felt “uncomfortable” when Prince Andrew said he would remember sleeping with a 17-year-old girl because sex, for a guy, is a “positive act”, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10406217/meghan-markle-troubled-prince-andrew-interview/"><i>The Sun</i></a> reports.</p>
      <p>A friend of Meghan told the <i>Telegraph</i> the interview had “left everyone watching it wanting to curl under a table. It just got worse and worse and worse”.</p>

      <p>And Harriet Wistrich, a lawyer at the Centre for Women’s Justice, said: “This clearly suggests a very sexist stereotypical view of sex as something men do to women.</p>
      <p>“It also makes no sense as to why it would be more likely you would remember it. The whole sentence – and interview – has no authenticity about it.”</p>
