      <h3>FILIPINO-American sensation Inigo Pascual has been one busy young man.</h3>
      <p>Since his first international single release of Options in June, Iñigo has been traveling the world for festival performances and media promotion in cities like Tokyo, New York, Toronto, San Francisco, London, Sydney, Honolulu and Rome. He’s collaborated with international pop artists like Pretty Much &amp; Alex Aiono of the US and New Rules from the UK.</p>
      <p>But his performance last Monday at the Staples Center as selected Filipino American artist at the LA Clippers’ Filipino Heritage Night was both historic and a personally special moment for Pascual.</p>
      <p>“I remember driving by the Staples Center when I was little or seeing it on TV when the LA Lakers or Clippers played and imagined how great it would be to perform there one day. It’s crazy to have that dream come true,” said Pascual.</p>
      <p>The sold-out crowd of over 19,000 attendees of every ethnicity filled the arena, a true testament to Pascual’s growing international popularity, being booked for the event the same week that his new single Catching Feelings is trending on popular millennial music app, TikTok, and nearing 2M global plays on Spotify alone.</p>
      <p>Pascual performed Catching Feelings but ended with the nostalgic Dahil Sa’yo (Because of You) to match the Filipino Heritage Night’s theme to much excitement of fans of all ages who purchased tickets to the event. Written when Pascual was only 19 years old, the song topped the Billboard charts in the Philippines with over 100 million YouTube plays on the music and lyric video. It has become a staple for any Filipino party whether a company office party or wedding.</p>
      <p>“To be honest, writing the song I didn’t realize how much impact it would have for generations to come,” he continued. “I wrote it as an appreciation to my fans but I love to see the different meanings it has acquired. No matter what audience I play for, I like to include some Filipino songs in them. Just like when you hear the Korean language in a Kpop song on pop radio out here, I see that happening for Tagalog in the future,” says Pascual whose goal is to bring the Filipino language to the Grammys one day.  </p>
      <p>Other participants of Filipino Heritage Night included Tarsier Records R&amp;B singer/songwriter Kiana V., Bay Area’s top rapper/producer P-Lo, stars of the new film, Fabulous Filipino Brothers, actors Dante/Dion Basco and DJ E-Man, one of the most influential Filipinos working in music, helping to run three of the most popular radio stations, Power 106, KDAY 93.5 &amp; Cali 93.9 FM. A postgame meet and greet on the Staples Center court followed the Clipper game with some of the top Filipino artists, influencers, DJs and event producers in the community for a selected group of fans.</p>
