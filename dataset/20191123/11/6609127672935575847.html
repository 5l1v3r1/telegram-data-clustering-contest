        <b>CHARLIE ADAM has revealed leaving Rangers broke his heart and reduced him to tears.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4987029/steven-gerrard-rangers-yabo-sports-ambassador/">Light Blues</a> midfielder was signed by the club as a youngster and spent time out on loan at Ross County and St Mirren before eventually moving south.</p>

      <p>During his time with the Buddies, in the 2005-06 season, he starred as the club won the Challenge Cup and won promotion to Scotland's top flight.</p>
      <p>His successful stints away from the club gave him hope of making it with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> but he left for Blackpool on loan in 2009 before making the move permanent in search for first-team football.</p>
      <p>He told the<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html"> Daily Mail</a>: "David Murray (then Rangers owner) used to tell the young lads coming through that when you left Rangers it was a step down.</p>
      <p>"I listened to that stuff but I wanted to prove people wrong.</p>

      <p>"You have to be like that. Some people think you are a good player, some don't. That's okay.</p>
      <p>"People believe that once you leave Rangers, you fall away. I didn't want that.</p>
      <p>"I used that as my drive. I knew I had been at a big club. I wanted to get back to a big club.</p>
      <p>"There was, though sadness amid the defiance.</p>

      <p>"I told myself: 'You ain't going to play. You have to leave.'</p>
      <p>"I knew to be in any way satisfied I had to play football.</p>
      <p>"But it was a tough thing to go. It broke my heart.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, it broke my heart. I sat and cried."</p>
      <p>Adam excelled for Blackpool under Ian Holloway who installed a lot of confidence in the midfielder.</p>
      <p>He helped the club reach the English Premier League and his impressive performances took him to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>He only stayed with the Reds for one season, where he played along side the likes of current Light Blues boss Steven Gerrard, Luis Suarez and Jamie Carragher, before joining Stoke City.</p>
      <p>Adam, capped 26 times by Scotland, left the Potters this summer and hooked up with Championship rivals Reading on a one-year deal.</p>
      <p>He's played seven times so far this campaign but is yet to find the net for his new club.</p>
