      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taron-egerton/">Taron Egerton</a> is just living the life right now – and making sure everyone back in cold, cold England knows about it – as he shared photos of his trip to the Dominican Republic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/rocketman-reunion-elton-john-hangs-taron-egerton-birthday-10919991/">The Rocketman star celebrated turning 30 with the lavish trip</a> – because what better way to celebrate a milestone than by staying in a $10,000 (£7,800) a night villa in absolute paradise?</p>
      <p>Taron shared a series of photos of his trip to the Dominican Republic, though it doesn’t look like he left the villa – and frankly, if we were staying in a resort like that, we’d want to make the most of it, too.</p>
      <p>He told his followers: ‘I cannot think of a better way to spend the first week of my 31st year than in this gorgeous place. Thank you @casadecampodr and @godomrep for an incredible week.</p>
      <p>‘Stunning scenery and incredible people. Particular thanks to the incredible staff at this beautiful villa for making it a magical experience.</p>

      <p>‘I have never experienced luxury like it. The perfect way to celebrate my 30th birthday. Thank you!’</p>
      <p>Although from his photos it looks like it was just Taron and his girlfriend enjoying his birthday vacay, the oceanfront villa they were stating in has five bedrooms and can sleep up to 15 people.</p>

      <p>The two of them also had five bathrooms to choose from, as well as access to amenities including golf carts to get around the vast resort.</p>
      <p>For the price, you also get breakfast prepared in your villa each morning as well as a butler service all day as well as a bottle of Moet &amp; Chandon champagne and other delicious food and drink on arrival.</p>
      <p>Other stars who have stayed in the lavish resort include Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Jennifer Lopez, Pharrell Williams, Justin Bieber and the Kardashians.</p>
      <p>We’re going to forgive Taron for rubbing in the fact he’s lounging in the sun right now with four spare bedrooms in the villa going to waste, just this once.</p>
