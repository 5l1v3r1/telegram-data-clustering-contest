      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said this latest instalment of Labour’s plans to overhaul the current tax system was needed to “raise essential revenue for our public services”.</p>
      <p>The additional tax is expected to raise around £3.3bn per year and would be used to help cool the housing market, “prevent illicit flows” and raise revenue for the Treasury. </p>
      <p>Labour’s pledge states: “A company purchasing residential property benefits from the UK’s infrastructure and legal framework, and ought to pay a small levy to acknowledge that”.</p>
      <p>The Tories have accused Labour of “lashing out” because they have “no credible plan to get Brexit done”.</p>

      <p>The Liberal Democrats manifesto also contains a pledge to increase stamp duty for foreign buyers of residential property.</p>
