      <h1>Property company looks to create 850 jobs with €100m Cork plan</h1>
      <h2>Rioja Estates, a UK-based company, has made a formal submission to local authority</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:15:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/colin-gleeson-7.3186977" target="_blank">Colin Gleeson</a></address>
      <p>A property company has announced plans to build a €100 million shopping and tourism destination in Cork, which it claims will create more than 850 direct jobs and draw 220,000 additional tourists to the region annually.</p>
      <p>Rioja Estates, a UK-based company, has made a formal submission to the County Development Plan 2014.</p>
      <p>A site for the “tourist outlet village” has been identified and secured at Killacloyne, Carrigtwohill, just off the Fota Junction on the N25.</p>
      <p>A tourist outlet village is described as “a specialist form of retail and tourist destination that sells heavily discounted products not normally found on the high street, for example end-of-line, seconds and out of season goods”.</p>
      <p>They do not offer other services such as banks, building societies, post offices, hairdressers, or dry cleaners.</p>
      <p>Rioja Estates said it would undertake a detailed environmental assessment and adopt a sensitive design approach reflecting the opportunities the site presents.</p>
      <p>Construction would take about two years, and the company said it was possible it could be open for business by March 2024.</p>
      <p>Martin Riordan, former county manager of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Cork+County+Council">Cork County Council</a>, said: “It is important that Cork secures this investment opportunity, which will provide an additional tourism and leisure attraction for the region.</p>
      <p>“The plan-led approach proposed by the council to guide and attract this type of development to the Cork region is to be welcomed. I believe that without a proper planning framework, this type of development will not be secured for Cork.”</p>
