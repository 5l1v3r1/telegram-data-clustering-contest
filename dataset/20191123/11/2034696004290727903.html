      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/terminator-dark-fate-review-arnold-schwarzenegger"><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i></a> director Tim Miller has said that he’ll never work with James Cameron again.</p>
      <p>Cameron served as a producer on the Arnold Schwarzenegger-starring movie, having directed the first two <i>Terminator</i> films.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Upon the release of the latest instalment last month, he said that “blood is still being scrubbed off the walls from [the] creative battles” experienced behind the scenes, with he and Miller clashing over their respective visions for the film.</p>
      <p>“This is a film that was forged in fire,” Cameron added. “But that’s the creative process, right?”</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/the-business/terminator-dark-fate-director-on-the-bumpy-road-to-a-box-office-bomb/tim-miller-on-terminator-box-office-woes-im-processing-but-im-very-proud-of-the-movie"><i>KCRW</i></a>, Miller has now opened up on the difficulties he faced while working on the project alongside producers Cameron and David Ellison.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure we could write a book on why it didn’t work,” he said. “I’m still not sure and I’m processing, but I’m very proud of the movie.”</p>

      <p>Referencing Cameron’s previous comments, he added: “Even though Jim is a producer and David Ellison is a producer, and they technically have final cut and ultimate power, my name is still on it as director.</p>
      <p>“Even if I’m going to lose the fight… I still feel this obligation to fight because that is what the director is supposed to do. Fight for the movie.”</p>
      <p>Miller went on to explain that he didn’t have “ultimate control” over his own movie and isn’t able to work well collaboratively.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>“You can work that way as a director, quite successfully, but I can’t,” he said, revealing that he would say “no” to working alongside Cameron in the future.</p>

      <p>“It has nothing to do with whatever trauma I have from the experience. It’s more that I just don’t want to be in a situation again where I don’t have the control to do what I think is right.”</p>
      <p>Miller revealed that Cameron emailed him to clear any animosity between the pair. It read: “I know we clashed a little bit. I put it all down to two strong, creative people with differences of opinion and I think it made the movie better. I’ll be back in LA in December. Let’s go get a beer.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/terminator-dark-fate-review-arnold-schwarzenegger">In a four-star review of <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i></a>, <i>NME </i>called the film “a rousing return to form”, adding: “Along the way, [Tim] Miller delivers some savage action sequences including a gut-churning early car chase, but it’s the compelling characters and ever-present tension that make this sequel really fly.”</p>
