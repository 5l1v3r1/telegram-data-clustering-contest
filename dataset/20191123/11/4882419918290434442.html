      <p>Jean-Clair Todibo's days at Barcelona could be numbered. Coach Ernesto Valverde has made it clear that he doesn't count on the French defender bu not even naming him on the bench against Leganes.</p>
      <p>Along with Carles Perez, Todibo was one of the players dropped from the 20 man squad, while Barça B defender Ronald Araujo -- as well as right-back Dani Morer -- were named in the final 18-man squad.</p>
      <p>Barça are in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over a January transfer for Todibo, who now looks more likely than not to leave the Spanish champions in the winter.</p>
      <p>Todibo joined Barça last January with the club beating off competition from Juventus to sign the highly-rated centre-back for a nominal fee.</p>
      <p>However, Barça still believe in his potential and hope to include a buyback clause in the deal which could see him leave the club.</p>
      <p>As well as Leverkusen, there's interest from England -- Watford have made contact -- but the German club are prepared to pay 10 million euros in a deal which seems to suit all parties.</p>
