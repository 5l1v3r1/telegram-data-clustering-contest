      <h1>Boost for Labour after surge in young people registering to vote in election</h1>
      <h2>The rise came on the unofficial National Voter Registration Day when 300,000 signed up to join the electoral roll. Of those a huge 200,000 voters were under-35</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T11:46:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Bartlett, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/nicola-bartlett/</a></address>
      <p>More than 300,000 people registered to vote in the December 12 <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> on Friday in what is believed to be the biggest surge in pre-election registration in UK political history.</p>
      <p>The figure includes a huge 200,000 of under-35s in what could be a big boost for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> who do well among the younger demographic.</p>
      <p>In the 2017 poll age was one of the most significant factors affecting how people voted.</p>
      <p>While the under-45s came out in force for Jeremy Corbyn's party, over-54s voted in greater proportions for the Conservatives than in 2015.</p>
      <p>Young voters favoured Labour, with 60% of those aged 18-24 voting for Jeremy Corbyn's party, while 61% of over-64s voted Conservative. </p>
      <p>The race to join the electoral roll took place on the unofficial National Voter Registration Day.</p>
      <p>The figures, released by the Cabinet Office, show that 308,000 registrations were recorded in the space of 24 hours, the vast majority of them online.</p>

      <p>Among those signing up to vote in the 12 December general election were 103,000 under-25s, 103,000 25-34 year-olds, 53,000 35-44 year-olds, 28,500 45-54 year-olds and around 20,000 over-54s.</p>
      <p>Labour backed the voter drive and leader <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said: “Yesterday Labour got behind National Voter Registration Day - unlike the Conservatives - because we want you to have a say in the future of our country.</p>
      <p>“And more than 300,000 people registered to vote. Make sure you can have your say on 12th December”</p>
