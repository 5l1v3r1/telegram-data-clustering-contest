      <p>Team GB's four-man bobsleigh team have finally been awarded their Olympic bronze medals almost six years after the Russian doping scandal denied them a podium place at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.forces.net/sport/royal-marine-bobsleigh-star-olympic-medal-wont-be-quite-same">Royal Marine John Jackson</a>, Joel Fearon, Bruce Tasker and RAF’s Stuart Benson received the medals in a presentation from Princess Anne at British Olympic Association Ball in London.</p>
      <p>The British team originally finished fifth in the competition but two Russian crews above them were later disqualified for doping.</p>
      <p>Royal Marine Jackson, said at the time it was "disappointing" to not receive the medals.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, he said: "It was utter relief when he found out that this [the medals] were ours.</p>
      <p>"I'm a Royal Marine, I was an athlete but first and foremost I'm a husband and a dad.</p>

      <p>"The legacy is I can show this to my kids and that means more to me than when it would have been presented in 2014."</p>
      <p>Royal Marine Jackson has since retired from competing in the sport competitively.</p>
      <p>Mr Fearon, who is the only member of the team still competing in the sport, admitted the emotion of the evening would not quite make up for the feeling of what they missed out on in Sochi.</p>
      <blockquote>"We gave our lives for that opportunity and we went away thinking we weren't good enough, but it turns out we actually were.</blockquote>
      <p>"I have three boys now but at the time I only had my eldest, Simeon, who was four years old.</p>
      <p>"He actually made me a medal when I got home and told me not to worry. It's great that I can show him a real one now."</p>
