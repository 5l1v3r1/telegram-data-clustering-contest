      <p>Flood-hit areas will face a 'disruptive' wet weekend with nearly two weeks' worth of rainfall in just a few hours.</p>
      <p>Forecaster has issued a total of four yellow <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings for rain that cover the southwest, east midlands and the Scottish highlands.</p>
      <p>Two of them will last from 4pm on Saturday until 9am on Sunday - that's 17 hours of downpours.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has 92 flood warnings and alerts in place in parts of the Midlands and northern England.</p>
      <p>Saturday will start off dry before persistent and heavy rain hit in the afternoon.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> meteorologist Helen Willetts said: "It will be really very wet for the Balearic Islands as we go through Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It will push into the United Kingdom and into France as well.</p>
      <p>"Large waves on the coast and more flooding rains are expected. The ground is already so saturated."</p>
      <p>Britons living in affected areas are expected to see cuts to power supplies and delays to public transport.</p>

      <p>The Environment Agency said that river flooding was possible in southwest England and Wales this weekend, and across parts of southern England on Monday.</p>
      <p>Weekend holidaymakers are warned of travel disruptions and advised to check for updates.</p>
      <p>Fog patches are also likely in parts of central, southern and eastern England.</p>
      <p>The weekend forecast will heap trouble to those in South Yorkshire, one of the worst-hit areas that sees 655 homes flooded and more than 1,300 people evacuated.</p>
