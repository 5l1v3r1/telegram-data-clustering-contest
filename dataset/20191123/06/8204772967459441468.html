      <h1>Four of my favourite Christmas party wines, and how to choose yours</h1>
      <h2>John Wilson: Wine stimulates the appetite so a few nibbles will provide welcome soakage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/john-wilson-7.1837442" target="_blank">John Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Having a party this Christmas? Choosing the right wine is not too difficult once you keep a couple of guidelines in mind.</p>
      <p>Supermarkets have plenty of sub-€10 bottles, but cheap wines really only benefit the taxman. To send your guests home happy, be prepared to spend €10 or more a bottle. If you can stretch to €15, you will certainly notice the difference. If your budget is tight, don’t worry; I list a few of my favourite €10 supermarket wines below. Either way, it is worth buying one bottle first and trying it out at home, maybe with a few friends.</p>

      <p>Richer, more alcoholic wines – white as well as red – are best avoided; a hefty 14.5 per cent red wine will overwhelm the palate and have your guests reeling after a glass on an empty stomach. Far better to go for lighter wines that refresh.</p>
      <blockquote>Remember wine stimulates the appetite and also tastes a lot better with food</blockquote>
      <p>Heavily oaked white wines are best kept for food, so avoid these if at all possible. With red wines steer clear of those with drying tannins; again, great with food but unpleasant on their own. There are plenty of wines with 11-13.5 per cent alcohol that will go down so much better.</p>
      <p>Lastly, remember wine stimulates the appetite and also tastes a lot better with food; a few nibbles, even bought-in supermarket party trays, will provide welcome soakage.</p>

      <p>There is a huge range of low-alcohol white wines, including Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough (always popular), but remember that Chile and the Loire valley also produce very good versions.</p>
      <p>Spain offers Verdejo from Rueda and Rías Baixas; Portugal has some great white wines, including Alvarinho and Vinho Verde, and from France I would go for Muscadet, Picpoul de Pinet or Côtes de Gascogne.</p>
      <p>Italy has a range of light whites, my favourites being Verdicchio and Soave, but a good Pinot Grigio would work too.</p>
      <p>Light, fruity red wines include inexpensive Merlot, Pinot Noir, Gamay/Beaujolais, unoaked Rioja and Valpolicella and Bardolino.</p>
      <p>My recommendations from the multiples include the Les Courtelles Picpoul de Pinet (€11) and Silver Moki Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc (€10.50) from Dunnes Stores, Picouto de Cima Vinho Verde (€11.95) and Rizzardi Bardolino Classico (€14.95) from O’Briens, and Exquisite Marlborough Sauvignon (€9.99) and South Australia Pinot Noir (€8.99) from Aldi. Lidl has Laurana Verdicchio di Castelli di Jesi and Madame Parmentier Régnié (both €9.99). Marks &amp; Spencer has a Verdicchio (€10.50) and a light, fruity Valpolicella Valpatena (€10.50).</p>
