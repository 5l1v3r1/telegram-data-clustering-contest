      <h1>John Turturro to Play Carmine Falcone in Matt Reeves' 'The Batman'</h1>
      <h2>Character first appears in “Batman Begins” played by Tom Wilkinson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:23:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:23</time> by <a rel="author">Beatrice Verhoeven, Umberto Gonzalez</a></address>
      <p>John Turturro will star as Carmine Falcone in Matt Reeves’ “The Batman,” the director announced on Twitter on Friday.</p>
      <p>Carmine Falcone first appeared in “Batman Begins” played by English actor Tom Wilkinson. The character made its debut in the comic books in the four-part story “Batman: Year One,” written by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli in 1987. In the comics, Carmine Falcone is a powerful mafia boss nicknamed “The Roman.”</p>
      <p>Robert Pattinson is set to star as the Dark Knight. Reeves took over the directing gig after Ben Affleck stepped away from the role. Affleck was also expected to play Batman again but then said he would be hanging up the cape for good. Reeves has since described the film as a “defining” and “very personal” story about the Dark Knight, rather than an origin story in the vein of Frank Miller’s beloved “Year One” series.</p>

          <figcaption>We've arrived at the 30th anniversary of the release of Tim Burton's "Batman," the film that you could argue ushered in the modern age of big screen superheroes. But whether or not you agree with that idea, you can rest assured that you will almost certainly disagree with our rankings of all the Batman movies. Because that's just how these things go.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-and-robin-1949.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>15. "Batman and Robin" (1949) is just an abysmal experience, with a bad lead actor wearing a floppy-eared Batsuit. Though The Wizard, a villain original to this serial, is admittedly cool looking, it's not enough to stem the boredom in this four-hour slog.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-1943-grandfather-clock.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>14. "Batman" (1943) gets points for novelty thanks to its hilariously over-the-top old fashioned World War II racism. But Batman's first onscreen appearance lacks pretty much everything that would mark it as an engaging filmgoing experience today. It's cool that a grandfather clock provides the entrance to the Batcave, though.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Justice-League-Banner.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>13. "Justice League" (2017) is just total nonsense, and unlike "Batman v Superman" can't even boast a good performance from Affleck as Bruce Wayne. And it doesn't have the decency to be enjoyably bad like "Batman and Robin" or "The Dark Knight Rises."</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-and-robin-1997-2.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>12. "Batman and Robin" (1997) is rightly hated, but it's tremendously entertaining here and there. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/uma_thurman/">Uma Thurman</a> and Arnold Schwarzeneggar are going so far over the top I can't help but admire them.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dark-knight-rises.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>11. "The Dark Knight Rises" (2012) probably wasn't intended to be a grim and gritty Shumacher Batmovie, but that is indeed what it is. This is Nolan going full Hollywood, smashing plot points into place by sheer force of will rather than because they make sense. An extremely theatrical <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/tom_hardy/">Tom Hardy</a> as Bane is amusing front to back, and a nuke with a countdown clock on it will never get old.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-v-superman-2.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>10. "Batman v Superman: The Dawn of Justice" (2016) is nearly saved by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ben_affleck/">Ben Affleck</a> going all-out as Bruce Wayne, but director <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/zack_snyder/">Zack Snyder</a> just couldn't keep his plot on track. There's too much ground to cover, and the movie is too unfocused to ever really cover any of it.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-89.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>9. "Batman" (1989) is fondly remembered mostly because it was the first Batmovie in a couple decades. It isn't actually very good, though. The reveal that a younger version of the Joker killed Bruce Wayne's parents is as hamfistedly dumb as it gets in a "Batman" movie.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/batman-v-superman-ultimate-edition.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>8. "Batman v Superman Ultimate Edition" does so much to improve the experience of watching it that it warrants its own entry -- it's basically a completely different move with all the important story beats and character moments it adds.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-forever.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>7. "Batman Forever" (1995) hits just the right tone for what Joel Shumacher was trying to do with the two films he directed. <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/tommy_lee_jones/">Tommy Lee Jones</a>, as Two Face, is doing stuff in this movie that is hard to believe even today, given his perpetual sour face in nearly every other movie he's been in.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/batman-mask-of-the-phantasm.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>6. "Batman: Mask of the Phantasm" (1993) Remember that time they released a "Batman" cartoon theatrically? It gets lost amongst all the live-action ones, but "Mask of the Phantasm" is better than most of them.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/the-dark-knight-joker.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>5. "The Dark Knight" (2008) should be way shorter, but <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/heath_ledger/">Heath Ledger</a>'s Joker is far and away the best villain in any of these movies. Ledger elevates what would otherwise be just another self-indulgent <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christopher_nolan/">Christopher Nolan</a> exercise into an endlessly watchable picture.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/LegoBatmanMovie.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>4. "The LEGO Batman Movie" (2017) is funny, sweet and self-deprecating -- exactly what we needed in the wake of the disaster that was "Batman v Superman."</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-begins-dead-parents.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>3. "Batman Begins" (2005) is the most complete film, on its own, in the entire franchise. It's just, like, a regular movie except it's about Batman. It has actual characters and everything, and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christian_bale/">Christian Bale</a>'s Bruce Wayne even has emotions. It's weird.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-returns.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>2. "Batman Returns" (1992) is one of the best of the franchise because it's really just a political thriller. The Penguin emerges from the sewer and runs for mayor of Gotham! It's great stuff, especially now that Donald Trump is president.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/batman-66.jpg"/>
          <figcaption>1. "Batman: The Movie" (1966) has a timelessness that none of the other films do, and it's just a delight from beginning to end thanks to <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/adam_west/">Adam West</a>'s winking Batman and the coalition of villains who can't stop cackling maniacally. Watching it again recently, I found it functions almost perfectly as a parody of the super-serious <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/tag/christopher_nolan/">Christopher Nolan</a> Batfilms, which is incredible. </figcaption>
