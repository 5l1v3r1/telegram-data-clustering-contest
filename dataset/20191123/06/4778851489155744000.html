        <b>Free public transport for all is to be pledged by the Scottish Greens in its election manifesto, The Scotsman has learned.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The radical move would be paid for by measures such as doubling vehicle excise duty for more polluting vehicles and scrapping the freeze on fuel duty.</p>
      <p>It follows Luxembourg announcing it would scrap fares from next March and the successful introduction of free bus travel in the French town of Dunkirk.</p>
      <p>The Greens will announce on Monday plans for free bus travel for under-21s as a first step towards universal free public transport.</p>
      <p>Despite being one of the smallest parties, the Greens influence on transport policy should not be underestimated, having pushed through the workplace parking levy in Scotland as part of a budget deal with the SNP.</p>
      <p>The Greens declined to put a timescale on introduction of the policy because of “uncertainty around Brexit and the constitution”.</p>
      <p>A spokesman added: “Because we have pitched it at a UK level, we haven’t yet gone into what that would mean at a Scotland level. The policy follows successful trials of free services in other European countries and cities.</p>
      <p>“It could be funded through reversing Tory policies that have fuelled a growth in traffic.</p>
      <p>“Scottish Greens would double first-year vehicle excise duty on more polluting vehicles, reverse the fuel duty freeze and end support for domestic aviation other than lifeline services to remote and island communities - raising more than £9.5 billion a year.</p>
      <p>“All fuel retailers would be compelled to provide charging points for electric vehicles by 2025.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said: “To tackle the climate and air pollution emergency we need to focus public funds on public transport, making it the most convenient and easiest choice.</p>
      <p>“Imagine how liberating it would be, to hop on and off our buses, trains and ferries at will without the need for fares.</p>
      <p>“Free public transport isn’t far-fetched.</p>

      <p>“It is happening in cities across Europe and will be in place in whole of Luxembourg by the summer.</p>
      <p>“What it requires, though, is political bravery.</p>
      <p>“The climate emergency requires an emergency response. That means reducing our heaviest polluters and building a low carbon alternative, fast.”</p>
