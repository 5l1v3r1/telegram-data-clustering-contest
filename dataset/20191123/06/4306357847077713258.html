      <h3>Mark Lawrenson is confident that Arsenal will secure a vital win against Southampton at The Emirates on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Gunners are desperately in need of a Premier League win to ease mounting pressure on Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have only managed to win one of their last six Premier League games to raise questions about the Spanish head coach’s future.</p>
      <p>The north London side’s last Premier League victory was a 1-0 win against Bournemouth at The Emirates last month.</p>
      <p>Arsenal will take on a Southampton side lacking confidence after they suffered a 9-0 loss to Leicester City before successive 2-1 defeats by Manchester City and Everton.</p>
      <p>Southampton have already conceded 29 times in 12 games, which amounts to the worst defensive record in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Lawrenson is backing Arsenal to secure a straightforward 2-0 victory over Southampton at The Emirates on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“If you had told me at the start of this week that one of the big clubs would be sacking their manager, I probably would have said it would be Arsenal and Unai Emery,” Lawrenson told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50490801">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>“I think Arsenal will win this game easily enough because of their firepower and the fact Southampton are in a mess – they have taken only one point from their past seven league games.</p>
      <p>“But I don’t think that victory on Saturday will mean Arsenal’s problems are over. They are still far too much of a soft touch at the back.”</p>
      <p>Arsenal are looking to secure a top-four finish for the first time in three seasons.</p>
      <p>Emery’s side finished in fifth spot in the Spanish head coach’s first season in charge.</p>
      <p>The Gunners are in sixth place and eight points behind fourth-placed Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have lost to Sheffield United and Leicester City and drawn with Crystal Palace and Wolves in their last four games.</p>
