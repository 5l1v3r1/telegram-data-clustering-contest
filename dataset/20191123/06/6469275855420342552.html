        <b>A 71-year-old florist used a smartphone app to track down an thief who trashed her shop and stole hundreds of pounds worth of goods.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Joan Marsden arrived at her flower shop, The Secret Garden, in Adelphi Street yesterday (November 21) to find it wrecked by burglars overnight.</p>

      <p>The intruders had smashed down a steel door before ransacking the shop and stealing cash from the till, an iPad, luxury candles and other products.</p>
      <p>The business owner, who opened the florist in 1987, said she was "sickened" by the sight of her shop which had been "completely turned upside down".</p>
      <p>Joan reported the burglary to the police, but after waiting for several hours for them to visit, she decided to do a bit of her own detective work.</p>
      <p>"They had stolen my iPad and my daughter told me that you can track it by using an app on your phone", said Joan.</p>

      <p>"So we visited the Apple store and they loaded up the app on my phone and we traced it to a nearby block of flats.</p>
      <p>"We were so angry by what had happened, we decided to just go over there and demand it back.</p>
      <p>"The app led us straight to the door of one of the flats.</p>
      <p>"At this point I was so angry, I was just seeing a red mist, so I shouted out in the corridor, "where's my iPad!?"</p>

      <p>Joan said she heard movement inside the flat before the door swung open and a man appeared brandishing a knife.</p>
      <p>"He stood there threatening me and my daughters with this knife, I couldn't believe it", said Joan.</p>
      <p>Police soon arrived at the flats in Adelphi Street and the man was arrested.</p>
      <p>He remains in custody.</p>

      <p>"I was just so angry and upset about what they have done to my shop", said Joan.</p>
      <p>"I've been here for 32 years and I love the area and we have so many lovely customers.</p>
      <p>"It just really got to me, and the police didn't seem that interested when I reported it, which made me think, "well, I'm just going to have to do something myself".</p>
      <p>"But I must say, the police were brilliant once I reported the man with the knife. They got here as quick as they could and they took him away in handcuffs.</p>
      <p>"We've found a few of our items in the flat, but not everything. The shop is in that much of a mess that we don't know exactly what's been stolen. There's stuff everywhere. It's heartbreaking."</p>
      <p>Joan said she will be spending the weekend cleaning up the shop and repairing the damage before reopening next week.</p>
      <p>"We don't have any time to waste, because all our stock is fresh", she said.</p>
      <p>"We have to try and sell the flowers as soon as possible, otherwise we will lose hundreds of pounds of fresh stock.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be stressful to try and open again in time for Monday, but it has to be done. What other choice do I have? This is my livelihood."</p>
      <p>Lancashire Police said a man remains in custody following arrest.</p>
