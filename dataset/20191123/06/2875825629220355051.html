      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Stephen Larkham warns that Munster can't just be on red alert for Simon Zebo's Thomond Park return this evening.</p>
      <p>Zebo is back in Racing 92's line-up after sitting out last week's win over reigning European champs Saracens due to the birth of his third child.</p>
      <p>Donnacha Ryan, another highly regarded ex-Reds star, also plays and will orchestrate the formidable Racing pack's set-piece attack.</p>
      <p>“They've got some talented players, it's not just Zebo," remarked former Australia star Larkham, who is making progress in his mission to upgrade Munster's own attack.</p>
      <p>"Their whole backline have some sort of threat. We have to make sure that we're respecting everyone in that backline.</p>
      <p>“We're very much focused on making sure our systems are in place. We're not tinkering too much with our systems.</p>
      <p>“And then we target a few of their individuals who we think we can pose some threats - we try and get a bit of pressure on them throughout the game.</p>
      <p>“It's trying to find little weaknesses here or there that we could exploit.”</p>
      <p>Larkham's imprint is already on the province, as evidenced by prop Jeremy Loughman's 20-metre pass to set up one of the tries last weekend that earned Munster a last-gasp bonus point win at Ospreys.</p>
      <p>The former world-class no 10, who has already praised to the hilt the skillset of the Reds squad, reckons that Loughman already had that in his locker - and that it's about unlocking that sort of potential now.</p>

      <p>But with three further changes to the starting line-up this week - JJ Hanrahan replaces the unfit Tyler Bleyendaal at out-half, while Tadhg Beirne and Jack O'Donoghue return to the pack - Larkham isn't trying to re-invent the wheel, especially as Munster's World Cup contingent continue to get up to speed.</p>
      <p>"Well, I think you got to be realistic," he said. </p>
      <p>"You look at the situation of where you are on the field - the conditions, the current score and then you have to respect the opposition. There are a number of different factors that come into your strategy.</p>
      <p>“And throughout the game, there will be changes in strategy too. </p>
      <p>"Sometimes we'll be a little bit more conservative but most of the time we're trying to encourage the players to find the space and play what's in front of them.</p>
      <p>"It's a slow process. You can't obviously dump everything on them in the first week. But over the next couple of weeks, they will get to understand everything we have been working on over the last three months.</p>
      <p>“It's just putting some systems and structures in place so the players can actually play what is in front of them.</p>
      <p>“When the players get comfortable with that, then it's not about constantly evolving the game, it's about just making the right decisions”.</p>
