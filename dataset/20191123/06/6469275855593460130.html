      <h1>Preston North End striker David Nugent’s promotion knowledge from the Championship will be vital</h1>

        <b>David Nugent’s game time at Preston might have been limited so far but Alex Neil thinks the striker’s vast experience will be key as the season goes on.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 34-year-old will be in PNE’s squad for today’s clash with his former club Derby County at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>He spent two-and-a-half years with the Rams, scoring 17 goals, and when they freed him in the summer Nugent made the switch to Deepdale on a Bosman.</p>
      <p>Since his return, Nugent has started three games in the Championship and come off the bench three times.</p>
      <p>In the League Cup match against Manchester City, he also got a run as a substitute.</p>
      <p>Neil said: “It’s good when you have got someone who is used to winning, used to being in the play-offs, used to getting promoted.</p>
      <p>“Just to have that experience for the younger players to lean on is really important.</p>
      <p>“There is a formula for getting promoted which is difficult to put your finger on, there’s a certain feeling you need to get – a determination and hunger.</p>
      <p>“The more you have felt that, the more you want to recreate it.</p>
      <p>“It is no surprise that you get guys who go from club to club and get promoted with them.</p>
      <p>“Gary O’Neil who I had at Norwich has had promotions a few times, teams look at him and think ‘We’ll have a bit of that, he knows how to do it’.</p>
      <p>“Nuge fits into the same sort of category. While I think he is having an influence now, if it does start to heat up for us, he will have more and more influence.</p>
      <p>“That is when the pressure kicks in and it is how you handle the pressure that matters.</p>
      <p>“He’s quite vocal in his own way, you hear him speak with the lads during sessions.”</p>
      <p>Nugent, Paul Gallagher, Paul Huntington and Tom Clarke are the senior heads in the squad, Neil says striking a balance in age is important.</p>
      <p>“While these lads have been brilliant for us, if you had 20 of them in the squad there would be a problem,” said Neil.</p>
      <p>“When you’ve got Nuge, Gally, Tom and big Hunts who know what it takes and have been around the block, it is great to have them.”</p>
      <p>Nugent and Huntington both played in a midweek bounce game at Burnley to boost their fitness, together with several other first-team squad players.</p>
      <p>That was arranged after the Lancashire Senior Cup tie with Barrow scheduled for last week was forfeited by the Cumbrian side.</p>
      <p>Said Neil: “Ideally we wouldn’t have had a game this week but we took the game to make sure some of the lads got minutes into their legs to keep at the right level.”</p>
