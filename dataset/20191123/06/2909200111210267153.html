      <p>Deputy Minister of Information, Pius Enam Hadzide has said the amount of GH¢6m million earmarked for “government communication” in the 2020 budget is not free money to be shared as opposition NDC members are alleging.</p>
      <p>According to him, the money is meant to go into special “publicity for government flagship programs” as instructed by President Akufo-Addo.</p>
      <p>“The instruction of His Excellency are that the Ministry of Information, which has the mandate of informing the people of Ghana on the projects, programmes and policies of government… we have to pay particular attention to educating the people about the far-reaching implications of these [flagship] policies with the view that we can carry the people with the government.” Mr Hadzide said.</p>
      <p>The issue of the GH¢6m was first raised by the Ranking Member of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Agriculture, Food and Cocoa Affairs, Eric Opoku, on the Floor of Parliament.</p>
      <p>He noted that there was a GHC6 million allocation to Government Communication in the budget under the section for expenditure under Government flagship programmes which could be “free money to be looted”</p>
      <p>In his submission, Mr Opoku said more clarity was needed on that budget line.</p>
      <p>But justifying the amount, Mr Pius Hadzide said “these flagship programs that are new in nature and revolutionary to all intents and purposes – We have decided that the people of Ghana have to be carried along as far as the implementation of these programs is concerned.”</p>
      <p>You will notice that in the coming weeks, for instance, there is Ghana at Work series that serializes achievements and challenges that have been identified with some of these flagship programs. So the amount that has been allocated under the government’s flagship communication is directed specifically to the dissemination of information relative to the government’s flagship programs.”</p>
