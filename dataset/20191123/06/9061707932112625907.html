      <p>The show homes at Wheeldon's new development <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/spondon">in Spondon</a> are now open and potential home owners have been out in force to view them, despite the weather.</p>
      <p>Three show homes opened their doors to the public for the first time at The Dial on Saturday November 16, and some 60 house hunters turned out to view over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Debbie Smith, sales and marketing director at Wheeldon, said: "We had such a wonderful reaction to the show homes and such amazing, positive feedback from our visitors."</p>
      <p>In fact, four of the 15 homes in the first phase of the development in Nottingham Road have already been reserved - two Cooper house types, a Maple and a Redfern design.</p>

      <p>Debbie said: "The show homes have a high-quality interior and an excellent specification throughout. Whether you are a professional couple, or a growing family, we are sure that The Dial, Spondon will appeal to you. We truly have homes to suit a wide range of budgets and with the Help to Buy scheme available on all our plots, you are sure to find your ideal home with Wheeldon."</p>

      <p>The Maple features a dining kitchen with French doors that lead to the rear garden, three well-proportioned bedrooms, including the master, which comes complete with fitted wardrobes and an en suite shower room.</p>

      <p>The site will eventually provide some 113 new homes in thirteen different house styles.</p>
      <p>When asked about the range of house styles and sizes on the development, Debbie said: "We hope to enable and encourage all buyers across the spectrum to become part of an emerging community, with everybody starting with the same new beginnings."</p>
      <p>As a local firm she explained that it was essential to keep standards high and maintain their reputation. "When it comes to established <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/property/">Derbyshire</a> companies, not many have the pedigree of Wheeldon Homes.</p>
      <p>"The company was first set up by brothers George and William, both joiners in Belper way back in 1867. They worked hard and quickly developed a name for themselves for excellent quality of workmanship. This ethos is still alive today and we are very proud of our heritage dating back over 150 years, James Parkin is our MD with his brother Edward our land director."</p>
      <p>The Dial is scheduled to take around two and a half years to complete, however the first home will be ready to move into at the end of January 2020.</p>
      <p>Debbie added: "We are delighted to be able to open the show homes, alongside our marketing suite where visitors and purchasers can see and discuss the whole range of properties available on this attractive site."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/where-to-live">And location?</a> Well, as well as having good road networks to Nottingham, Derby and the M1, the developer says it is hopeful that the canal-side site will eventually link up with the current cycle routes and enable cyclists to ride to both Derby and Nottingham too.</p>
