      <h1>Optus to overhaul mobile phone plans in push for 5G</h1>

      <p>Singtel Optus will overhaul mobile phone plans next week to attract sign ups for its new high speed 5G mobile network just six months after rival provider Telstra radically changed its own offers.</p>
      <p>Optus is bolstering its inclusions for customers who use high-speed 5G-enabled phones by doubling data allowances for the first 12 months without charge on some new plans as competition heats up in the roll out of the new mobile network.</p>

      <p>The new plans mark the end of lock-in contracts, are "5G ready" and give customers the option to customise what they want to pay for. This comes after recent <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/australians-won-t-pay-premium-for-5g-survey-20191111-p539eb.html?js-chunk-not-found-refresh=true">survey data from Deloitte</a> suggests Australians are not yet willing to pay a premium for 5G services.</p>
      <p>The shake up has reduced Optus' plans from 28 options to four pre-built packages priced from $39 for 10GB to $79 for 120GB.</p>
      <p>Telstra redesigned its mobile and fixed-line plans <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p5203n.html">in June as part of the telco's overall turnaround plan</a> Telstra 2022, in a move to reduce about 1800 options to 20. This included customisation options and dropping lock-in contracts.</p>
      <p>Optus' mobile users will also be able to pick how much data they want including for roaming, and change this on a monthly basis, from Monday â€“ when the plans are launched.</p>
      <p>Optus managing director of marketing and revenue Matt Williams said the telco had spent the last three months researching and designing the new "radically simplified" options amid intense competition in the mobile sector.</p>
      <p>However, he denied the changes were due to feeling pressure after Telstra's overhaul, though acknowledged competition was "pretty intense".</p>
      <p>"In terms of customer growth, we're doing very well," Mr Williams said. Optus grew post-paid handset customers by 30,000 subscribers over the three months to September 30 with more customers holding onto their mobile phones for longer.</p>
      <p>"Ultimately this will affect millions of Australian mobile users," he said about the new plans. "We want to make sure we are very active in the market and taking the lead."</p>
      <p>Major telcos have turned their attention to 5G and attracting more customers after disruption in fixed-line internet from the National Broadband Network and pressure on profits from higher data inclusions and falling prices on mobile plans.</p>
      <p>Optus has about 300 5G tower sites live while Telstra has also been quickly rolling out its 5G network in major cities.</p>

      <p>Optus has also made moves to specifically target the top-end of town customers, who Mr Williams said were "not served as well as they should be" by telcos at the moment, with luxury $119-a-month plan Optus One.</p>
      <p>The new plan includes one-to-one personal service for customers, priority on the network in times of congestion, access to Optus Sport content and other extra inclusions like international roaming.</p>
