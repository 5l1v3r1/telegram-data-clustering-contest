      <p>Arsenal will look to end a run of four Premier League games without a win when they host <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have experienced a miserable run leaving manager Unai Emery under pressure.</p>
      <p>But they will hope to get back on track after the international break to make up ground on the top four.</p>
      <p>They are eight points off fourth placed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , already facing a tough task in their bid to secure a return to Champions League football.</p>
      <p>A struggling Southampton side travel to north London after four defeats in their last five games leaving them 19th in the Premier League table, just one point clear of Norwich at the bottom.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are set to be without Spaniard Dani Ceballos due to a hamstring injury, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang set to captain the side after taking over the armband from Granit Xhaka.</p>
