      <h1>The John McGinn masterclass against Celtic that had Scotland hero destined for the top</h1>
      <h2>St Mirren star Paul is loving seeing his wee brother flourishing on the big stage.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Paul McGinn caught wee brother <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John</a> watching re-runs of his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> goals on TV just hours after he put Kazakhstan to the sword on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>But it was a Hampden masterclass against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> as an 18-year-old seven years ago that convinced the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> star his younger sibling was heading to the top.</p>
      <p>McGinn insists nobody deserves his moment in the limelight more - and says the Aston Villa star is a shining example to every young player of what can be achieved through dedication.</p>
      <p>McGinn junior notched the first and third goals as Steve Clarke’s side ended a torrid Euro 2020 qualifying campaign on a Hampden high.</p>

      <p>It made it seven strikes in the last six international matches to add to the three Premier League goals he’s notched for Villa.</p>
      <p>His form for club and country have seen McGinn linked with a £50million move to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>But while that valuation might surprise Paul, the fact his wee bro has reached the top doesn’t after watching him boss Scott Brown and Victor Wanyama in the 2012/13 League Cup semi final win over Celtic.</p>
      <p>He said: “John stayed at mine on Tuesday after the Scotland match. He likes to see his nephew.</p>
      <p>“I actually caught him watching the game back and rewatching his goals - I’m sure he had recorded it on my Sky box!</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t watch the bad games only the good ones.</p>
      <p>“It just shows you, he got so many knocks - he got relegated, he got a pole in his leg - it’s how you react to the knocks in football.</p>

      <p>“I never thought he was going to be valued at £50million but when he was 18-years-old at Hampden against Wanyama and Brown, he was brilliant then. I was waiting on the knocks on the door at that stage.</p>
      <p>“He had to wait a bit longer but the people who were close to him always said he will get there and will get his chance. He’s certainly taken it.”</p>
      <p>McGinn reckons his brother’s story is an inspiration to youngsters but for now the only motivation he wants is for the Buddies.</p>
      <p>Today’s home clash with Ross County is the first in a crucial spell as St Mirren look to climb off the bottom of the table before Jack Ross returns to Paisley with Hibs on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“I think with St Mirren these are the type of games you are judged on,” he said. “Ross County have come up and done really well but these are the type of games against teams around us that fans will expect us to go and win.</p>

      <p>“It’s early doors and we were bottom much later than this last season. We are not panicking.</p>
      <p>“I suppose everyone has their own motivation. Ross County will see they can stretch the gap with us so there’s motivation across the board.</p>
      <p>“We have been pretty good at home this season. Only Rangers have beaten us. It seems like forever since we played at home. But I said at the start of the season I would like to make it a place where teams didn’t enjoy coming and so far that’s been the case.</p>
      <p>“Fingers crossed with these two games we can do the same.</p>
      <p>“The fans were brilliant with us last year and knew we were up against it a bit. They got behind us and it was ideal. Fingers crossed they can do that again but hopefully they won’t need to. Hopefully they don’t need to dig in with us and can just come and enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“The performances have been there but we can’t keep saying the same thing. Until we get results then we need them to stick with us.”</p>
