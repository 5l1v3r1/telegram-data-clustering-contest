      <p>Freezing cold hands and damaged bank cards could be a distant memory after one driver shared his amazing life hack for dealing with a frozen windscreen.</p>
      <p>As the weather gets colder, motorists are having to scrap their windscreens in a morning - and it can prove to be a huge pain.</p>
      <p>But one driver has banished frozen hands and scraping until the cows come home, with his ingenious hack that went viral.</p>
      <p>No longer will people be late for work due because they just could not get the car de-iced.</p>
      <p>But if you take on board what this man has come up with your mornings might go a whole lot smoother as he can <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">de-ice his car in an instant</a>.</p>
      <p>His tutorial on just what to do, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/facebook">which he posted on Facebook</a>, went viral.</p>
      <p>Instead of using a trusty can of de-icer and a scraper, Daniel Harris simply fills a sandwich bag with warm water.</p>
      <p>He then drags it over the car windows and watches the ice melt immediately.</p>
      <p>On Facebook, he wrote: "Hot water in a food bag and bam you've got a de-icer and a hand warmer. Works a treat, and it's fast!"</p>
      <p>He added: "I used warm tap water so I could safely hold it and lower the risk of cracking my screen.</p>
      <p>"The de-icer cans are <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/burton-swadlincote-weather-forecast-snow-2475921">so cold in the morning</a> and this way keeps you nice and toasty.</p>
      <p>"Oh and yes it was ice not condensation. I know it looks it but try it and you won't be disappointed."</p>
      <p>The tip is sure to come in handy this winter.</p>
