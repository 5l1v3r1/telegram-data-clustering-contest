      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ambati-rayudu/">Ambati Rayudu</a> appealed to Telangana’s Minister for Industry and Municipal Administration, KT Rama Rao to look into the ‘rampant corruption prevailing in HCA (Hyderabad Cricket Association)” in a tweet on Saturday. Rayudu alleged corruption in HCA one day after taking a break for a few weeks from playing first-class cricket for Hyderabad. Rayudu cited personal reasons for the break on Friday.

      <p>In September 2019, former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin was elected as HCA President.</p>
      <p>This was Rayudu’s first tweet after the infamous ‘3D glasses’ tweet after World Cup 2019 squad selection where all-rounder Vijay Shankar was chosen over him.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old retired midway through the World Cup 2019 in July only to take it back in August. Rayudu, who was reluctant to play four-day games to prolong his white-ball career returned to red-ball cricket after the announcement.</p>
      <p>In Vijay Hazare Trophy 2019, he was the second-highest run-scorer for Hyderabad with 233 runs from seven games. In the previous week, Rayudu was retained by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2020.</p>
