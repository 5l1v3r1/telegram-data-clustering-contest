      <p>Do Tortoises have wings? The answer is obvious. How then in the world can a tortoise fly? But yes, it does in the luscious imagination of the authors of the first volume of a forthcoming slim but exceedingly powerful book titled ‘The Parables of the Flying Tortoise’. The authors, Opesanwo Olusola and Ayodele Ayobolu, are the founders of the inspirational outfit ‘Entrepreneur D.A.I.R.Y. Series’, an initiative that seeks creative ways to promote businesses and inspire the people behind them to aspire to greater heights. This publication is thus an inspirational book albeit not the run of the mill stuff all too familiar with this genre of writing. Utilizing the mediums of fables and poetry, they titillate the imagination, stimulate thinking, offer hope and arouse faith in even IN situations seemingly denuded of promise.</p>
      <p>The book takes its title from the parable ‘The Flying Tortoise’ by Opesanwo, which indeed is the first offering in its pages. This parable in many ways encapsulates the essence, style and message of the book – its simple profundity and subtlety of thought as well its capacity to excite the mind and provoke the reader to think the unthinkable and dream the impossible. Opesanwo’s tortoise is not prevented from flying by the absence of wings. Its shell does not constitute an obstacle to the operation of the law of lift. Even from its lofty height in the skies, its otherwise ugly scales and cracks “were no representation of pain, rather it had produced a beautiful mosaic and one word described her smile, priceless!”</p>
      <p>She continues in this parable, “So what held the onlookers down, what is the shell that has refused to embrace lift? Could it be fear, procrastination, the weight of unbelief, the weight of blurry visions or the dead weight of no vision at all? Cracks may become necessary to loosen up this shell”. As for the tortoise, it cared less about the astounded onlookers as “The spiral imprint around her knees seemed to be a constant reminder of the need to keep going, when little, when much, only adding up to greater heights”. Are the stories of most successful people across time and space not tales of valiant fighters who, like the tortoise in this fable, turned weighty shells of poverty, weakness, disadvantage and the discouraging cracks of various kinds of failure into the wings of determination, resilience, commitment, industry and unshakeable resolve to succeed?</p>
      <p>In his autobiography, ‘Awo’, the great statesman, Chief Obafemi Awolowo, narrates in gripping prose his battles with poverty of the most stark kind as well as failure on a variety of fronts in his early years. These could easily have been insurmountable shells shackling him down like the tortoise to a life of defeat, obscurity and negligible impact. At a point, for instance, his adventures in business collapsed miserably and all his belongings had to be auctioned to pay off his creditors. To make matters worse, he was on hand to personally watch some of his supposed friends buy off his prized possessions at the auctioning exercise!  Years later, through sheer force of character, self-discipline of an uncommon nature and unwavering commitment to set goals, Awo qualified as a lawyer, achieved financial security and rose to become one of Nigeria’s most successful politicians, administrators and statesmen.</p>
      <p>Having escaped the stifling grip of poverty and failure and achieved his goals, Awolowo had famously declared, “After rain comes sunshine; after darkness comes the glorious dawn. There is no sorrow without its alloy of joy; there is no joy without its admixture of sorrow. Behind the ugly, terrible mask of misfortune lies the beautiful soothing countenance of prosperity. So, tear the mask”! This credo certainly is the underlying message that runs through the six fascinating fables by Opesanwo Olusola and the six philosophical poems by Ayodele Ayobolu that comprises this book.</p>
      <p>In his poem, ‘A Letter to Fear’, Ayodele Ayobolu is confronted by fear in the form of a letter just like puny David had to square up to the physical behemoth, Goliath, in the Bible. Fear bellowed that tomorrow, in the unlikely event that it came at all, held only gloom as it was possible for the sun to be held hostage, the poet’s heart or health to fail, the world itself go up in flames or the law of gravity to cease, leading to utter chaos in the universe. The poet had a choice between intimidation, yielding to a debilitating paralysis of the will or confronting the threatening fear called Goliath with David’s pebbles of courage hurled on the sling of faith. He chose the latter.</p>
      <p>In his words:</p>
      <p>“So I said…</p>
      <p>It’s just a letter. And I’m still here</p>
      <p>It’s just a letter, and I can write one too</p>
      <p>“So I chose to write…</p>
      <p>That the wind will blow</p>
      <p>I will breathe fresh air</p>
      <p>I will love the greenery</p>
      <p>I will lie on the sea shore</p>
      <p>And watch the ships stroll by</p>
      <p>I will be bold like the sailor’s horn</p>
      <p>And sturdy like the sailor’s anchor</p>
      <p>I will look fear in the eye and ask where are you now?”</p>
      <p>Another poem in the book, ‘Story of the Old Shoe’ is a thoughtful reflection on life. The shoe was once brand new, smelt nice, was polished and spotless and wished it would remain so for ever. But it was bought by its owner and soon subject to use and the attendant wear and tear. Narrating the shoe’s experience, the poet writes, “I have picked a few pebbles, been kicked against the wall/I have entered palaces and public places/I have taken the hit”. At the end of it all, however, the shoe concludes, “I have learnt to be happy/I have learnt to be content/I have learnt to be grateful”.</p>
      <p>Life cannot forever be lived in the mother’s womb, the baby’s cradle or in the comforting arms of loving parents. Every life must be subject to the experience of acting his or her part on the stage of life, enduring its pains, savouring its joys, coping with its struggles and the poet enjoins all to be unceasingly grateful for the opportunity. There are those, of course, who confronted with the adversities and insoluble enigmas of life, conclude that existence for man has no meaning or purpose or even resort to a total loss of faith in God. That is not the gloomy and destructive path that the authors proffer in these insightful poems and fables.</p>
      <p>For instance, the fable, ‘Silent Cry’, is about Mopelola, who suffered abuse as a child, with the experience scarring her emotionally for life. Paralyzed by painful past memories from enduring and enjoying the present, she is also incapacitated from anticipating the future with hope and expectation. Rather, she yearns for a return to the blissful past that preceded her painful experience – an impossibility. But Mopelola encounters a sojourner who exhorts her that “What lies ahead is always greater than what lies behind. Put the past to rest. The past has not clung to you, but you to it. Let go, Mopelola, of the pain, the hurt and the shame. We are all sojourners in life and ahead lies our destination”.</p>
      <p>These fables and poems of life and living are soothing balms for the mind in these troubled times. They are deeply spiritual but in a subtle rather than irritatingly obtrusive way. When it hits the bookshops, this book will surely appeal to and add value to readers of diverse ages, faiths and experiences.</p>
