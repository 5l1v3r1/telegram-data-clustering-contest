      <p>Former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> striker Peter Crouch believes Spurs chairman Daniel Levy must ‘compromise’ if <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> is to be successful in north London.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s appointment as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s successor at Spurs sent shockwaves through the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> this week and the Portuguese will take charge for the first time when Tottenham travel to West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old was sacked after a disastrous run of results in which the club picked up just 24 points from their last 25 league matches but external factors impacted the Argentine’s work in the last 12 months.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was unhappy with the lack of investment in the side and also felt that the club were not willing to implement his changes quickly enough, especially when it came to selling players entering the last year of their deals at the club.</p>

      <p>Mourinho was sacked at Manchester United after experiencing similar problems with those above him and Crouch believes it will take an effort from both – but particularly Levy –  to compromise if Spurs are going to be successful.</p>

      <p>‘Levy has gone for Mourinho, he knows what he’s going to get,’ Crouch told <i>Metro.co.uk</i> at Sportsmail’s ‘A Pint with Piers’ event in London.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not as if it’s a secret what he [Mourinho] usually does. It’s not usually the way that Levy does business so he’s going to have to compromise.</p>
      <p>‘He’s hired him and he’s not going to change Mourinho. Mourinho’s been hired because he’s Mourinho. Levy needs to cut him a bit of slack and let him do what he needs to do.’</p>

      <p>The manner of Pochettino’s exit has certainly irked supporters and his assistant, Jesus Perez, revealed the Argentine left a message on a whiteboard in the dressing room thanking his players after he was sacked.</p>
      <p>Reports before Pochettino’s sacking claimed the Argentine had ‘lost’ the dressing room and that his message was simply no longer getting through to the squad.</p>
      <p>Crouch admits there have been problems at the club but insists his initial reaction was one of shock as Spurs decided to pull the trigger on the most successful manager in their recent history.</p>

      <p>‘Just shock really because I felt if anyone deserved time it was him, having got them to a Champions League final last season,’ continued Crouch.</p>
      <p>‘You have to say results have been poor. Tottenham need to get into the Champions League and that just doesn’t look likely at the moment.</p>
      <p>‘There’s been rumblings about a lot of the players wanting to leave. You have to ask; had he run his course? Daniel Levy’s obviously done what he feels right but I think it’s a sad situation that’s left a bad taste in everyone’s mouth.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone loved Pochettino. I’ve met him a few times and he’s a warm, engaging, friendly. Nobody likes to see it happen but football is a ruthless business and he wasn’t getting results.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think at the start of the season Spurs would have hired him [Mourinho]. In a lot of ways…sometimes clubs are close to relegation and they get someone in that doesn’t play the way the club wants to but it’s about surviving. I think this is a similar situation but at the top end of the league.</p>
      <p>‘The situation is clear; the club need to get into the Champions League. Mourinho is not the usual fit for Tottenham. Levy wants young players who have a re-sale value, that can improve and be able to improve the club. Mourinho traditionally buys 30+ players who do the job now because he knows he’ll only be there one or two years. That’s against the philosophy of Tottenham so it’s a strange fit but it’s needs must.’</p>

      <p>No manager in history has spent more than Mourinho in club management but he will have a tighter budget to work with at Spurs compared to his previous clubs.</p>

      <p>The 56-year-old insists he’s happy with the squad he’s inherited but he’s believed to be keen on signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is available on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>Crouch agrees with Mourinho that the squad doesn’t require overhauling but says the Portuguese coach will be concerned by the lack of strength in full-back areas.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like they still have a top squad, they’ve got top players,’ Crouch told Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘This is the same team that got to the Champions League final, they can beat anyone on their day.</p>
      <p>‘What it is is just top players not performing so this is more a case of galvanising them. They don’t need much. Defensively maybe they need players, the full-backs haven’t been great. Certainly at right-back that needs addressing.</p>
      <p>‘I think the front three are brilliant. Son is world class, Kane’s world class. You have Lucas Moura. Eriksen, he just needs to get his head screwed on because he’s a top player.’</p>
