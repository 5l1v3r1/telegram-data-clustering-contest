      <p>Are you feeling festive? Well you are in luck, because Lidl’s real <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> trees are back.</p>
      <p>The budget supermarket is selling Nordmann Fir trees for £18.99 in a decorative pot, or freshly cut for £17.99.</p>
      <p>But this year is bigger and better as shoppers can benefit from a 6ft tree for £24.99.</p>
      <p>And according to the retailer, their trees have strong pine needles which means less shedding to save you from vaccuuming.</p>
      <p>Lid’s trees are sourced from the Scottish Highlands, where they have been grown in 2,000 acres of rich green woodland.</p>

      <p>They’re also 'LEAF' certified meaning they have been sustainably grown with consideration and care for the surrounding countryside and wildlife.</p>
      <p>The trees will go on sale from Thursday, November 28 while stocks last.</p>
      <p>Once shoppers have purchased a tree, they can find out exactly where it was grown using a special tree tracker.</p>
      <p>Keeping with the festive theme, Lidl are also selling wreaths and festive poinsettia, so you can get all your Christmas decorations in one place.</p>
