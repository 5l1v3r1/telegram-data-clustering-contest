      <h1>Shane O'Sullivan dismisses Ballygunner's favourite status in Munster Hurling final</h1>
      <h2>You can get the reigning provincial champions, six-in-a-row winners in Waterford, as short as 1/6</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>When Ballygunner’s favouritism for tomorrow’s AIB Munster club hurling final is put to Shane O’Sullivan, he methodically goes about dismantling that status.</p>
      <p>You can get the reigning provincial champions, six-in-a-row winners in Waterford, as short as 1/6 to retain their title tomorrow against Borris-Ileigh, who are back in the final after 33 years.</p>
      <p>“When you think of that, that’s from the bookmakers’ point of view,” O’Sullivan begins.</p>
      <p>“If you are to take the educated hurler’s point of view or to look at both teams, you wouldn’t think that. So you can break it down to facts and ask, ‘Right, what about Borris-Ileigh, what are they bringing?’</p>
      <p>“Well they are bringing All-Ireland senior winners, they have an All-Ireland senior winner in every line on the field. Go through it, full-back Paddy Stapleton, centre-back Brendan Maher, midfield Dan McCormack, half-forward line Conor Kenny, full-forward line young (James) Devaney.</p>
      <p>“They are absolutely fantastic hurlers. We know this. We are lucky in the sense that we can see the height of the fence that we have to jump, because if we did get caught up in that bookmakers’ opinion you’d already be at a disadvantage.</p>
      <p>“We are very aware of the challenge that’s coming, the spirit that’s coming, Tipperary hurling is on a high at the moment, it’s really strong. First thing is having an awareness of the challenge, and we are very clear on that.”</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Ballygunner haven’t been so prolific at collecting Munster titles that they can be blase about what’s ahead of them.</p>
      <p>After winning their first Munster in 2001, they added a further eight county titles before they conquered the province again last year, including losing finals in 2005, ‘09, ‘15 and ‘17.</p>

      <p>“If you look at our history, our record in Munster wouldn’t be good really, in a sense,” O’Sullivan admits.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ve won only one out of five, in the last 10 years in Munster. And the last time we won it was 17 years ago, that was a long time ago. So that’s a great advantage to have, because you don’t have to look back too long to see when you didn’t perform when you needed to on the big occasion and you didn’t win it.”</p>
      <p>O’Sullivan retired from inter-county duty at the end of 2016 amid dwindling game time under Derek McGrath but his transition to being a club hurler only was pretty seamless.</p>
      <p>“I have a young three-year-old kid to fill that void. There wasn’t a void in a sense because I was coming into Ballygunner.</p>
      <p>“It’s like life, you get nurtured very young, your club develops you, then you may go and play inter-county if you are good enough, they support you all the way, but then when that’s finished they are still there and they take you back and care for you.</p>
      <p>“I was lucky in that sense with my club.”</p>
      <p>And despite Waterford’s struggles in the last two seasons, O’Sullivan says the club’s sizeable county contingent hasn’t brought the mood down on their return.</p>
      <p>“No, not our lads. The lads we have from the county set-up are just a brilliant influence around the scene.</p>
      <p>“They love playing with their club, really enjoy it. You’d have to ask them as well, but this is my opinion, I find they bring an energy and enthusiasm to it as well.</p>
      <p>“They really embrace it, and that might be the reason we have won some county championships, they’ve really taken the leadership in that sense.”</p>
