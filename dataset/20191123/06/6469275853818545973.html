        <b>A new bar specialising in underground electronic music will be opening in Preston - with a ‘no phones’ policy designed to create an ‘immersive’ experience.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In:Libra, a venue on Friargate offering a wide variety of music including disco, house and techno, will be opening its doors for the first time on Saturday, November 30.</p>
      <p>The opening night, which will also launch their monthly party Triangles, will be curated by Liverpool producer and DJ ASOK.</p>
      <p>Serena Baxter, In:Libra’s managing director and co-owner, said: “After a number of recent appearances at Berghain | Panorama Bar in Berlin, ASOK is gaining a serious reputation globally and we are really glad to have him on board for his project.</p>
      <p>”We had been looking for a venue in Preston for a while and we finally found one on Friargate which we thought was a perfect, intimate space for what we had planned.</p>
      <p>“While Preston has a busy nightlife, the music tends to be more commercial.</p>
      <p>“With friends travelling to Liverpool and Manchester to find this style of music and venue, we felt that it would be great to bring it to Preston.”</p>
      <p>The owners are also looking into hosting jazz nights and live acts.</p>
      <p>Serena added they want people to really enjoy the venue: “In order to guarantee an immersive experience, the bar will be under a strict no-phone policy, and no video or photography will be allowed inside.</p>
      <p>“The idea is to have something exciting and unique. We want the place to be immersive, somewhere you can switch off and fully enjoy yourself.”</p>
