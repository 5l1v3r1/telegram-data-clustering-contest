      <h2>Chelsea star prepares to face Man City by sharing video of himself as a youngster firing home a set-piece that would make CR7 proud</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:25:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:25</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mason Mount fired a warning of his talents ahead of Chelsea's showdown against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - by sharing a video of himself as a youngster firing home a Cristiano Ronaldo-style free-kick.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> midfielder Mount is in thrilling form ahead of Saturday's mouthwatering clash against City at the Etihad Stadium, where third plays fourth as the rivals aim to catch Premier League leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mason-mount">Mount</a> has scored four goals in 12 Premier League games so far this season, and notched his first for England in the Three Lions' 4-0 win over Kosovo last weekend.</p>
      <p>And now he has shown what else he has in his locker, tweeting a video of himself as an aspiring young footballer showing how he had learned to take direct free-kicks from set-piece master Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>In the video, Mount is seen confidently explaining how he has adopted Ronaldo's technique - before confidently tucking away a kick that would have made the former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> man proud.</p>

      <p>The young Mount says: "I try to base my free-kick on Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>"Hit the ball by the valve and it moves. That's all you do - top corner, top bins."</p>
      <p>He is then seen confidently stepping up and bending a free-kick over the wall and past the helpless keeper into the back of the net.</p>

      <p>Mount, now 20, will be part of a youthful Chelsea line-up hoping to go four points clear of Pep Guardiola's City at the Etihad on Saturday.</p>
      <p>City could be 12 points behind leaders Liverpool by the time the game kicks off at 5.30pm on Saturday evening, with Jurgen Klopp's side visiting <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> in a 3pm kick-off.</p>
