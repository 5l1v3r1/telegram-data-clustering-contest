      <p>These pictures show the full extent of the construction work being carried out inside the intu Broadmarsh shopping centre as it undergoes a multi-million-pound transformation.</p>
      <p>The Broadmarsh is currently undergoing a major £89m regeneration <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/broadmarsh-redevelopment-whats-happening-what-1968027">that will bring a cinema and bowling alley to the shopping centre.</a></p>
      <p>When the regeneration project is complete in summer 2021, the glass-fronted building will also include new restaurants and high street shops.</p>
      <p>The shopping centre was originally opened in 1975 by the Duke of Gloucester, and featured a large Co-operative store, Witney's, Newman Granger, and a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/substantial-improvements-made-wimpy-broadmarsh-1768795">Wimpy restaurant.</a></p>
      <p>It was linked by two footbridges to the current <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/shopping/">shopping</a> centre, but these have now been removed as part of the demolition.</p>

      <p>The redevelopment of the shopping centre is part of a wider £250 million regeneration scheme of the Broadmarsh area, which includes the demolition and rebuild of the car park and bus station.</p>
      <p>The new car park will provide 1,200 parking spaces and include electric car charging points, while the new bus station will also offer national travel services.</p>
      <p>Work is well underway on Collin Street, which will eventually be pedestrianised.</p>
      <p>In October a crane was brought in to carry out the "phased demolition" of the existing front of the shopping centre which is being fitted with steel, glazing and cladding to make way for the new cinema.</p>
      <p>Nottingham City Council hopes the development will boost the local economy, create jobs and attract more visitors to the city.</p>
