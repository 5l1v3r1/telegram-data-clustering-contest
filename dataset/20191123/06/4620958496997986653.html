      <p>Jardine said she had been an award nominee for a number of years, but was never selected.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely been an amazing year and I’m super honoured to be recognized in this category with the BC Country Music Association.”</p>
      <p>She is thankful for being “surrounded by great people who inspire (her) daily” and said the award is a reminder that she is on the right path and is “doing the right thing pursuing (her) career in the right way.”</p>
      <p>“This has been a direct response to the (university) program I was in which focused on community and creating space for people to tell their stories.</p>
      <p>“I can see it as a life-long commitment and I think in general for life, for me to live a life of passion in music (…) is amazing.”</p>
      <p>Jardine hosts and performs at her weekly writer’s night called The NashUp 615 at Alley Taps in Nashville.</p>
      <p>Recently, she released a new series called “Demo Files” on Oct. 1 where fans can hear her new music by joining her email list.</p>
      <p>“The fun part is that (the fans) get to hear the songs first before anyone else,” said Jardine.</p>
      <p>Jardine will be returning to Richmond over the holidays with possibly “a few shows” scheduled.</p>
