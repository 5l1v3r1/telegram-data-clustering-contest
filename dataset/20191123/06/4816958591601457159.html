      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:07:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:07</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Mathis scored 18 points and made five 3-pointers, and teammate Payton Pritchard added 16 points to lead No. 11 Oregon to a 78-66 win over Houston Friday night in Eugene, Ore.</p>
      <p>Sophomore Francis Okoro added 12 points and the Ducks (5-0) made 54.2 percent of their shots, including 10 of 21 from 3-point range.</p>
      <p>The game was a matchup of two Sweet 16 teams from last season, and Oregon avenged a 65-61 loss at Houston last season in nonconference play.</p>
      <p>Freshman Caleb Mills finished with 21 points for Houston (2-2), knocking down the Cougars’ only two 3-pointers on 20 total attempts. Fabian White Jr. added 12 points.</p>
      <p>Houston had a big edge in rebounding (38-26) and second-chance points (21-4) thanks to its size advantage, but it didn’t translate into a win.</p>
      <p>The Cougars tested the Ducks early, going ahead by as many as eight, 22-14, in the first half before Oregon went on a 15-2 run to take the lead for good.</p>
      <p>Chris Duarte hit a pair of 3-pointers and a jumper during that run, and Oregon closed the half up 32-27 on a basket and free throw from Okoro.</p>
      <p>The Ducks went ahead by 10, 45-35, on a 3 from Mathis with 15:47 left in the second half. Later, with the Cougars down by six, Mathis hit a 3 and was fouled, completing a four-point play with 11:15 to go for a 51-41 Ducks lead.</p>
      <p>Oregon went ahead 64-47 after Okoro blocked a shot at one end, then ran the court for a dunk off a lob from Duarte.</p>
      <p>The Ducks led by as many as 21 in the second half. Oregon is 166-20 under head coach Dana Altman when holding opponents under 70 points, including a 131-12 mark the last six seasons.</p>
