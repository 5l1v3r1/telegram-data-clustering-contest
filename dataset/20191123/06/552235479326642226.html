      <h1>Steven Gerrard says Rangers star Ryan Jack is as good as Callum McGregor and John McGinn</h1>
      <h2>The Rangers boss has backed his man and praised Scotland's midfield blend.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Ralston, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gary-ralston/</a></address>
      <p>Steven Gerrard reckons <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> is the equal of any Scottish midfielder in the game.</p>
      <p>The Rangers boss believes Scott Brown’s decision to consider a Scotland comeback is good news for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> .</p>
      <p>But the former England skipper insists Jack, a standout this season, was key to the dark blues’ victories over Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Brown admitted it was a case of “never say never” when asked if he would come out of international retirement for the third time to compete at the Euros.</p>
      <p>Gerrard said: “First and foremost that’s a decision for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> and whether he makes himself available for selection.</p>
      <p>“Then it’s over to Steve Clarke and he will pick the best players available to make Scottish football a success again. For Steve’s sake the more players available, the better.</p>
      <p>“I do not and will not try and make Steve’s decisions but it’s no surprise to me Scotland have won their last two games with Ryan Jack in the team.</p>

      <p>“The midfield is the area of the team in which Scotland are strongest. But let me tell you right now that Ryan is a match for any of them in his own way, in terms of what he gives to a team and the manager.</p>
      <p>“A lot of Jacko’s stuff is not fantastic on the eye if you like, but if you are talking about an all round midfield performer he is right up there with any of those midfielders, don’t worry about that.”</p>
      <p>Gerrard knows a thing or two about running the engine room at the highest level of the game and believes Clarke has found a perfect balance as the Scots prepare for their play-off semi-final against Israel in March.</p>
      <p>He added: “If you play three in there, you are looking for balance. You can’t have three the same.</p>
      <p>“The good thing is they are all different. Ryan is your enforcer, if you like, and does a bit of everything.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/callum-mcgregor">Callum McGregor</a> is your footballer, your connector, a really lovely passer who plays through the lines and always makes himself available.</p>
      <p>“And John McGinn is your power, your runner and goal threat. The balance between the three of them made sense and that’s why it was a success.”</p>
