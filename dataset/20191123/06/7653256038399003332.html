        <i>I would avoid RBL from the current prices but IndusInd could be a good trading bet to go long from the current levels., says <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rahul-Shah">Rahul Shah</a>, VP, Group Leader-Equity Advisory Group, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Excerpts from an interview with <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/ETNOW">ETNOW</a>.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b><b>ET Now: </b>What do you make of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/markets">markets</a> in the last few weeks?<br/></b><b>Rahul Shah: </b>The markets have been obviously in the grip of bulls and we have seen that participation coming across-the-board rather than being skewed towards one or two sectors. Earlier, only financials used to be performers but now, there is a broader participation. It looks like whenever we see a broader base participation, the rally lasts for some more time.</p>
      <p>We saw pharma, autos, NBFCs and a few select pockets bouncing back. Auto and financials also outperformed. The broad-based rally is likely to continue for a while.</p>
      <p><b><b>ET Now: </b>What do you make of the Zee news?<br/></b><b>Rahul Shah: </b>The hangover about promoters defaults go on. This saga has been going on for quite some time. Obviously post this, we saw a good bounceback in the stock. Now, the biggest challenge for the company is corporate governance and how they are going to manage going forward. But in the near term, the stock has rallied as far as it could. I would not buy it at this point of time. In case I have it, I would just ride it .</p>
      <p><b><b>ET Now: </b>What is your view on the way the telecom names have turned around? Do you think telecom as a pack including Reliance would be a part of your core holding?</b> <br/><b>Rahul Shah: </b>If you look at the entire play, there is value at some price. That is what we saw in the entire telecom pack last week, post momentum building up in a lot of stocks. Obviously, the top of the mind is Bharti. It looks quite convincing. If I need to play telecom business, then I would definitely bet on Bharti from current levels vis-à-vis others. Reliance also looks good but my sense is that Bharti would be outperformer, if I have to play pure telecom. <br/><b><br/><b>ET Now: </b>What do you make of the comeback in names like RBL? Could you include IndusInd Bank in that? Some of the banking and NBFC names that had people worried are slowly and steadily, seeing some interest in the market?<br/></b><b>Rahul Shah: </b>Last one year has been very eventful and especially in NBFCs and a few private banking stocks. IndusInd Bank looks quite interesting in terms of valuations and way they have performed in the last two quarters. IndusInd can see some more of upside from current levels. Obviously, the stock has underperformed big time vis-à-vis other private sector banks.</p>
      <p>Again in case of RBL, I feel the way the stock has performed, the upside is quite limited. So, I would avoid RBL from the current prices but IndusInd could be a good bet to go long from the current levels.</p>
      <p><b><b>ET Now: </b>Any ideas that you would like to share?</b> <br/><b>Rahul Shah: </b>The financials and a few corporate banks look interesting. Among PSU banks, the State Bank of India looks very attractive at current levels.</p>
      <p>Secondly, insurance as a theme has played very well and there could be some more upsides in select insurance players like <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/sbi-life-insurance-company-ltd/stocks/companyid-2898.cms">SBI Life</a> from the current levels. The stock has corrected from recent highs. We have been liking <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/state-bank-of-india/stocks/companyid-11984.cms">SBI</a> Life and in auto pack, Eicher could be a good bet from the current levels. We have been recommending these two-three names to our clients.</p>
