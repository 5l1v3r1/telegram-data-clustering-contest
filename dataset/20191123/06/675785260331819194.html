      <h2>Jose Mourinho takes charge of Tottenham for the first time against West Ham United on Saturday with both teams desperately needing a London derby win</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho leads his Tottenham side into battle for the first time against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> United on Saturday, in a mouthwatering London derby between two sides who desperately need to reverse their form.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> head to the London Stadium today hoping for the boost a new manager normally brings, after Mourinho took over the reins from Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Last season's Champions League finalists are floundering in 14th place in the Premier League, and they go in search of their first win in six league games against a West Ham side two places below them and in even worse form.</p>
      <p>After Pochettino's sacking, Hammers boss Manuel Pellegrini is one of the favourites to be the next Premier League manager for the chop.</p>
      <p>His side have suffered four defeats in their last five matches - and the Argentine boss desperately needs to spoil Mourinho's welcome party.</p>
