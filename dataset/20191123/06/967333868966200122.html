      <p>Colombia has been engulfed in mass unrest since Thursday that has turned violent and prompted authorities to impose a curfew in Bogota and several other cities.</p>
      <p>Protests were initially planned at a student rally, but some in the political opposition announced plans to hold a general strike the same day. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201911191077353078-colombia-closes-all-land-borders/">Fearing that Colombia</a> might follow recent scenarios that have endangered several other Latin American administrations, the incumbent government <a href="https://sputniknews.com/latam/201910301077177643-at-least-5-indigenous-people-killed-in-armed-group-attack-in-southwestern-colombia/">has taken what it describes</a> as preemptive measures.</p>
