      <h1>Paul Flynn: My favourite meals with vegetables in the starring role</h1>
      <h2>I love meat, but vegetables deserve better than to be reduced to a mere supporting act</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/paul-flynn-7.4907738" target="_blank">Paul Flynn</a></address>
      <p>I never got the allure of baby vegetables. In fact they always annoyed me and turned me into a grumpy old man. They were jumped-up, overpriced little upstarts that in my mind required tweezers to pirouette them on to the plate. Not my style of cooking, I would pompously harrumph. I suffer the occasional baby beetroot, but only to indulge the frilly vanity of the occasional gravadlax. </p>

      <p>I like my vegetables big and butch – something that can take the hardship of an Irish winter. Cutting them into manly chunks gives me enormous satisfaction. I invariably roast them, bathed in cider, butter, cinnamon and a bit of fresh thyme or a bay leaf. They cook into a less gaudy version of Sinbad’s treasure. Their dusky, nutty glaze awaits to comfort and soothe you .</p>
      <p>Jerusalem artichokes make me happy. I scrub these knobbly roots, then slowly roast them in duck fat, thyme and skin-on garlic. A whisper of golden-brown sugar at the end and they are sweet, crispy and gooey, all in one mouthful. This to me is cooking – the transformation of a humble ingredient into something surprising by just being thoughtful and curious.</p>
      <p>I want to be brave enough to change the way I cook. I love meat but sometimes I feel that placing vegetables as merely a supporting act grossly under-rates them and doesn’t challenge me. I would be happy to sit down to a plate of glistening roasted roots, punctuated with a small bit of sticky oxtail or duck, with a cooling river of horseradish cream to complete the picture. We are driven by the consumption of meat and we are conditioned to the idea of meat and two veg. This is both primal and traditional.  </p>
      <p>This week’s dishes are favourites of mine because we have a mixture of everyday and fancy. The parsnips I love to have with almost anything, but especially roast chicken. The Jerusalem artichokes are unsung heroes of mine. Not all that easy to get, unfortunately, but if you do come across them, this is a wonderful dish. And there is also a quirky cheese dish that can be anything you like – starter, lunch or cheese course. It dignifies the turnip and is robust enough to stand up to this beautiful blue cheese. </p>
