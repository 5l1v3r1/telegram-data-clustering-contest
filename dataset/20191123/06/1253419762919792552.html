      <p>Saibot Studios and Nimble Giant have launched a brand new demo for Hellbound so you can get your frantic, blood-soaked first person shooter fix.</p>
      <p>Created in homage to the 90s FPS classics such as Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem 3D and Blood (amongst others), Hellbound focuses on action, speed and gore as you fight against hordes of enemies who have taken over a distant planet.</p>
      <p>In this demo, you will get your first taste of Hellbound. Players will visit the Unholy Lands of Hell, a forgotten place that was sacred once.</p>
      <p>Here are the key features of the game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Play as Hellgore, the Ultimate Demon Smashing Badass.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Experience one of the early episodes of the Hellbound single player campaign.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Discover Hellgore ?s arsenal including the Infamous Indolora and the monstrous Triple Shotgun.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Succumb to the relentless Old-School FPS gameplay presented in glorious (and Gory) High-End Graphics.</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lastly, the full version of HellboundÂ is coming to Steam in 2020.</p>
      <p>You can download the demo for Hellbound from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753590/Hellbound/">here</a>.</p>
