      <h1>Met Office weather forecast for Bristol and Britain - cold, grey and wet weekend ahead</h1>
      <h2>Winter is almost upon us</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>It will be a distinctly dreary autumnal weekend in Bristol and Britain with no sunshine, lots of battleship grey clouds bringing rain and a chilly easterly wind.</p>
      <p>The Met Office forecast for Bristol on Saturday begins with overnight rain clearing away by breakfast time, as a dark morning dawns under heavy skies.</p>
      <p>There's going to be a 20 per cent chance of rain for the whole of the morning, as an easterly wind flirts with changing to the north - which means temperatures will struggle to get up to 10 deg C.</p>
      <p>That's a bit milder than the cold, clear, crisp days we had earlier this week and last weekend, but it will feel cold and wet with a 95 per cent humidity and that niggly easterly breeze.</p>
      <p>By lunchtime on Saturday, the rain will return, with intermittent showers coming and going throughout the afternoon.</p>
      <p>And then as darkness falls - not that the day will be anything approaching bright in the first place - the cloud will descend as the wind drops, and Saturday evening will be mild, damp and misty.</p>
      <h3>Sunday</h3>
      <p>Sunday promises to be a little bit better. The wind, which dropped overnight to give us a foggy night, will turn to the south, and by breakfast time on Sunday, the skies will still be grey and overcast, but a bit lighter and brighter for most of the day.</p>
      <p>There'll be the odd shower by the middle of the afternoon, but it will be noticeably brighter.</p>

      <p>But it won't last. Sunday evening will see a return of another cold front, bringing heavy rain for much of the night.</p>
      <p>Monday will start showery, but we might actually see some sunshine on Monday morning.</p>
