      <h1>New York City 'F--- the Police' protest turns violent, dozens of arrests reported</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:05:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:05</time> by <a rel="author">Brie Stimson</a></address>
      <p>Demonstrators shouting "F--- the police!" turned violent in the Harlem neighborhood of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/new-york-city">New York City</a> on Friday evening, vandalizing city buses and police cruisers, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Nearly 60 people were arrested in what organizers said was a protest of excessive <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">policing </a>of the city's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/disasters/transportation">subway system</a>.</p>
      <p>The outburst came in the wake of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo calling for 500 additional police officers to join the state-run Metropolitan Transit Authority's force and several viral videos showing subway arrests that some thought showed excessive force, including pointing a gun at a teenager who jumped a turnstile, New York's <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Crowds-Take-to-Harlem-Streets-to-Protest-Arrests-of-Food-Vendors-in-Subways-565365031.html">WNBC-TV</a> reported.</p>

      <p>“F--- cops and every racist, fascist person out here," a protester who identified herself as Alicia, 22, of the Bronx, told the New York Post. "These are our neighborhoods."</p>

      <p>At one point, New York City Transit tweeted that subway lines were bypassing the 125th Street station in Harlem and videos posted online showed that police had temporarily closed the station.</p>

      <p>A previous protest in the city's Brooklyn borough on Nov. 1 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-backs-anti-cop-protesters-who-jumped-subway-turnstiles-in-new-york">drew a supportive Twitter message</a> from U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, D-N.Y.</p>
      <p>“Ending mass incarceration means challenging a system that jails the poor to free the rich,” the left-wing freshman congresswoman tweeted, retweeting a video of protesters jumping subway turnstiles in Brooklyn.</p>
