      <p>NAGOYA — Japan’s foreign minister said he plans to discuss the contentious issue of wartime laborers on the Korean peninsula at a meeting with his South Korean counterpart on Saturday, a day after Seoul pulled back from the brink an intelligence-sharing deal with Tokyo.</p>
      <p>The comments from Toshimitsu Motegi, at a news conference during a G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in the central Japanese city of Nagoya, are the latest sign the two Asian nations may be moving to improve ties.</p>
      <p>A long-burning historical dispute – particularly about the issue of forced labor on the Korean peninsula during World War Two – has damaged relations between the two U.S. allies. (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Neil Fullick)</p>
