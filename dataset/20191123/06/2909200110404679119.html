      <p>Member of Parliament (MP) for Bolgatanga Central constituency, Isaac Adongo has pointed to figures he says are concocted by the Bank of Ghana (BoG) under the watch of its Governor Dr Ernest Addison to cover up the current deteriorating state of the banking sector.</p>
      <p>Government through the Bank of Ghana and Finance Ministry as contained in MyNewsGh.com’s earlier reports, touted a very positive outlook of the banking sector following a clean-up exercise which saw the collapse of some banks.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Ken Ofori Atta during the presentation of the 2020 budget in Parliament said “Following the successful completion of reforms in the banking sector which begun in August 2017 and ended in January 2019, we now have a more resilient sector, well positioned to support the economic growth agenda of the government. Banks are beginning to refocus on their core mandate of financial intermediation based on their strong capital base after the recent completion of the recapitalization exercise. A well-capitalized, solvent, liquid, and profitable, and resilient banking sector has emerged with improved financial soundness indicators in line with expectations. Even with fewer banks, asset growth within the banking sector in 2019 continues to be robust, underpinned by sustained growth in deposits and higher capital levels while credit has continued to recover compared to the same period last year.”</p>
      <p>This assertion has however been vehemently refuted by Isaac Adongo, pointing to figures released by the Bank of Ghana in July 2019 which suggest a declining growth and robustness of the banking sector.</p>
      <p>According to him, testing the Finance Minister’s statement on the banking sector against data released by the Bank of Ghana and the Ministry of Finance itself, shows the statement is factually inaccurate.</p>
      <p>The outspoken Member of Parliament said at a public forum on the 2020 budget statement that Ghana’s banking is now at risk of slipping into capital crisis with a buffer of only 3.3% to hit Basel II/III measured minimum requirement of 13% capital adequacy.</p>
      <p>Isaac Adongo noted that per data released by the Bank of Ghana in July 2019, Ghana’s capital adequacy was 17.4% in January, declined to 16.6% in February and recovered to 17.4% in March, due mainly to the issuance of a GH¢1.5 billion bond by the Government to Consolidated Bank Ghana to cover the collapse of Heritage Bank and Premium Bank.</p>
      <p>“By June 2019, the CAR of our banks had deteriorated to 16.3%, with a buffer of 3.3% to cover for any new risks and deteriorating assets in the banking sector. This means that Ghana’s banking is now at risk of slipping into capital crisis and it explains why banks are not lending to the private sector”.</p>
      <p>While accusing the Bank of Ghana Governor of cooking up figures to present a good picture of a crisis situation, he added that “It is interesting to note that Dr Ernest Addison and his team on realising the worsening situation of our banks’ capital adequacy cooked the numbers in September 2019 to hide the true state of the deterioration in the health of the financial sector. They had forgoten that the said data for January to June 2019 had been released in July 2019”.</p>
      <p>Presenting a table of data as haven been released by the BoG in September 2019, it shows that Ghana’s capital adequacy ratio as of January 2019 stood at 20.8%, February stood at 18.9%, March had 20.6%, April 19.6%, May 19.6% and June at 19.3%.</p>
      <p>The figures released in September according to Isaac Adongo were concocted.</p>
      <p>He further stated that “Dr Addison manufactured a 3% increase from March to June to double the buffer in CAR in order to hide the deteriorating capital conditions of our banks.Clearly, Dr Addison is a credibility nightmare for our country and the central bank”.</p>
