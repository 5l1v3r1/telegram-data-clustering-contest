      <h1>East Kilbride stalwart who helped shape New Town celebrates special milestone</h1>
      <h2>Remarkable Mary Swinton was joined by some VIPs as well as family to mark her 100th birthday in style.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nicola Findlay, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicola-findlay/</a></address>
      <p>A remarkable <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> stalwart has celebrated her 100th birthday in the town where she has helped create a bit of history herself.</p>
      <p>Mary Swinton lived in the very first street in the New Town and has helped found churches and schools.</p>
      <p>Born Mary Livingstone in a tenement in Parkhead, on November 2, 1919, she grew up in a very different world from the one we know today.</p>
      <p>She was born into a loving family, the second-oldest of four children, and had a very happy childhood in Glasgow’s East End, with summer holidays spent in a holiday cottage in Maxwellton Village, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride.</a></p>
      <p>Mary met her husband-to-be, Charlie Swinton, when she was 15, but dreams of their future together had a major setback when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis at the age of 17.</p>
      <p>A further obstacle was placed in their way when the Second World War was declared, with Charlie joining the Royal Corps of Signals, in the Army.</p>
      <p>Mary moved around various hospitals for treatment and it was while she was in Hairmyres Hospital that one day, with the help of other patients, she sneaked out, got a bus to Glasgow with Charlie… and came back to the hospital ward engaged.</p>
      <p>The couple married and, after deciding to set up home in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/east-kilbride">East Kilbride</a> as the clean air was good for Mary’s lung condition, they secured a modest room for rent in 1946.</p>
      <p>Four years later, the New Town was launched and Mary moved to Lindsay Road, the first street of the New Town, where she and Charlie raised their two children, Jean and David.</p>
      <p>Mary took on a job in Jack Stenhouse’s shop in the Village before moving on to work in the Education Department of Lanark County Council, based in the County Buildings, in Hamilton.</p>
      <p>She was very involved in her church and, along with others, worked hard to establish a new Church of St Bride, in Glebe Street in the Village, which was followed by work to establish the school of St Bride’s.</p>
      <p>Around this time, a lady called Ethel Sanderson started a group for children with additional support needs, and Mary also helped the children for a number of years.</p>
      <p>Some years later, the family moved to St Leonards and again Charlie and Mary worked tirelessly to establish the church and, subsequently a school at St Leonards.</p>
      <p>As the town developed, Mary also developed her own abilities and trained to be a youth leader, setting up and running a very successful club for young people, three nights a week, for a number of years.</p>
      <p>Also a very talented seamstress and tailoress, Mary undertook teacher training at the College in Hamilton and then taught dressmaking classes in East Kilbride for many years.</p>
      <p>Mary has always loved to dance and, along with her close friends, she regularly attended sequence dancing at the Red Deer Centre.</p>
      <p>She eventually retired from work and, along with other good friends, started the Kilbryde ladies Club, taking on the position of treasurer, a job she maintained until she was 90.</p>
      <p>Mary is now an honorary member of the club.</p>
      <p>With three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, Mary is still close to her family.</p>
      <p>Described as a special lady who has lived her 100 years well, Mary is recognised for having done so much for her family and for many others she has met along the way.</p>
      <p>South Lanarkshire Provost Ian McAllan presented her with a card, framed scroll and flowers while Deputy Lieutenant for Lanarkshire Clare Gallagher officially handed over Mary’s birthday card from the Queen.</p>
