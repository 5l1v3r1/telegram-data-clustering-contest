      <p>More than 45,000 people descended on Marvel Stadium on Saturday for the second day of the Jehovah's Witness international convention.</p>
      <p>Thousands of Jehovah's Witnesses, many from around the world and interstate, streamed into the stadium on Saturday, when a mass baptism of more than 400 people was the highlight of the day's events.</p>

      <p>Typically dressed in shorts and T-shirts, men, women and children of all ages, including one man in his 70s, took part in the full immersion baptisms, in baths dotted around the stadium's playing surface.</p>
      <p>"We typically do the baptisms on Saturday lunchtime at our conventions," said Jehovah's Witnesses local spokesman, Mark Lewis.</p>
      <p>On Friday, more than 42,000 people attended the first day of the global convention which has drawn visitors from more than 70 countries.</p>
      <p>Organisers expect up to 50,000 devotees to turn out for the final day on Sunday, topping the stadium's biggest AFL crowd this year of 48,278 for the Essendon-North Melbourne clash on Good Friday.</p>
      <p>"We've got 6300 international delegates and another 27,000 or so from other parts of Australia and thousands more from regional Victoria so that's a lot of hotel rooms and people shopping and sightseeing and eating out," Mr Lewis said.</p>

      <p>"We expect the convention overall will inject about $60 million into the local economy," he said.</p>
      <p>Candance Washington and Kyrianna Evans from Chicago arrived in Melbourne last Sunday and head home on Tuesday. During their stay they have visited the Bellarine Peninsula, Healesville Sanctuary and the Dandenong Ranges on bus tours organised as part of the convention.</p>
      <p>"We're having a lovely time. We've done lots of sightseeing and everyone is so friendly," Ms Evans said.</p>
      <p>But the best part, they say, has been the convention itself.</p>
      <p>"We love coming here and you walk past all your friends and they give you gifts from all over the world, like pins, and bracelets and it just makes you feel so welcome," Ms Washington said.</p>
      <p>Najah Cage, who is visiting from California, agrees.</p>
      <p>"We took the ferry to Sorrento and we went to the Healesville Sanctuary and to St Kilda and it's been a very nice time.</p>
      <p>"But we love the convention most. To come here and see brothers and sisters from all over and seeing that the love we have is worldwide is really touching," she said.</p>
      <p>Extra trains and trams were scheduled to cater for the crowds.</p>

      <p>Mr Lewis dubbed the convention, which has a theme of 'Love Never Fails,' a huge success.</p>
      <p>"Anytime we get together ... it's a very happy event and something most people here have looked forward to since 2014 when we last hosted an international convention here in Melbourne," he said.</p>
      <p>"The convention committee has been working on it for two years. There are over 10,000 volunteers who have been involved in the preparation and running of the program and its been truly wonderful.</p>
      <p>"It's such a spiritual event, such a peaceful and happy event for our organisation."</p>
      <p>The Jehovah's Witness church, and its overarching body Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, are no strangers to making headlines.</p>
      <p>The group came to the attention of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Sexual Abuse, which heard the Jehovah's Witness Church in Australia received allegations of child sexual abuse <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-gil1u7.html">involving more than 1000 of its members</a> over a 60-year period but did not report a single claim to police.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-guukur.html">Some survivors of sexual abuse within the church have also described being ostracised</a> when they told church authorities or left the organisation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-116b9u.html">The modern movement of Jehovah's Witnesses</a> began in the US state of Pennsylvania in the 1870s as a Christian denomination. They have held conventions in Australia since the 1950s.</p>
