      <p>Jason Carter made two free throws with 10.1 seconds remaining, and No. 18 Xavier beat Connecticut 75-74 in double overtime on Friday to advance to the final of the Charleston (S.C.) Classic.</p>
      <p>Naji Marshall had 21 points for the Musketeers, including 13 straight Xavier points in the second half and first overtime.</p>
      <p>Xavier (6-0) will meet Florida in the final on Sunday. Connecticut (3-2) will oppose Miami in the third-place game.</p>
      <p>Xavier’s Paul Scruggs added a season-high 19 points, Tyrique Jones had 17 points and 11 rebounds, and freshman Zach Freemantle had five blocked shots, inducing one late in the second overtime.</p>
      <p>Freshman James Bouknight had 19 points in his second game of the season to lead a balanced UConn attack. Alterique Gilbert had 14 points, and Tyler Polley and Josh Carlton had 10 apiece for the Huskies.</p>
      <p>Bryce Moore’s lone 3-pointer of the game gave the Musketeers a 72-69 lead in the second overtime, and Dahmir Bishop hit a free throw to make it 73-69. Gilbert was fouled on a three-point attempt and made all three free throws with 1:05 left to cut the deficit to one.</p>
      <p>After Moore missed a 3-point attempt, Bouknight sank a layup for a 74-73 Huskies lead with 21 seconds remaining. However, 11 seconds later, Bouknight was called for the decisive foul on graduate transfer Carter, who improved to 15-for-15 from the free-throw line this season.</p>
      <p>The Musketeers have won their first six games for the first time since the 2016-17 team began 7-0. That year, Xavier lost to Gonzaga in the NCAA Tournament’s Elite Eight.</p>
      <p>UConn shot only 30 percent the field but made 25 of 27 free throws. Xavier shot 37.9 percent and was 16 of 26 from the foul line.</p>
      <p>Marshall scored five points in the final 33 seconds of regulation, including a deep 3-pointer with 19.1 seconds that tied the game. He scored Xavier’s first seven points in overtime after Bouknight hit two free throws.</p>
      <p>The Musketeers lost a five-point lead in the final 22 seconds of the first overtime. Gilbert made two free throws before Bouknight was fouled while sinking a 7-foot follow shot. He added the free throw with 7.8 seconds left to tie the score.</p>
      <p>In a game in which 50 fouls were called, Marshall, Scruggs and point guard Quentin Goodin fouled out for Xavier. Carlton, Bouknight and Isaiah Whaley fouled out for UConn.</p>
