      <h1>MLB questioning players regarding sign-stealing scandal</h1>

      <p>Major League Baseball is turning to the players for help in the Houston Astros’ sign-stealing investigation.</p>
      <p>League officials, investigating whether the Astros stole signs electronically and cheated over the past three seasons, have asked players what they know about the range of alleged sign-stealing techniques, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28143162/sources-mlb-querying-players-astros-sign-stealing-allegations">according to an ESPN.com report</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The officials have asked the players about a wide range of cheating methods, according to the report. Numerous charges of alleged wrong doing have been brought to commissioner Rob Manfred’s attention by other teams officials. They include buzzing, Band-Aid-like wearable stickers; hidden earpieces; pitch-picking algorithms — to name a few. The league is still probing whether all of these methods have been used, or if some are just fiction.</p>
      <p>According to the report, players who may have cheated and violated league rules could expect some leniency if they provide truthful answers to questions.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it’s unlikely that consideration would be afforded to members of the Astros’ front office and coaching staff who could face severe punishment if they are found to have cheated, sources told the website.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest scandals to ever hit major league baseball began earlier this month when former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers told The Athletic that the 2017 World Series-winning team he was a member of<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/former-astros-pitcher-mike-fiers-says-team-electronically-stole-signs-in-2017/"> used video from a live camera feed to steal a catcher’s signs</a>, and that someone in the dugout would hit a trash can to communicate the pitch type to batters in real time.</p>
      <p>It also has been reported that new Mets manager Carlos Beltran, along with Red Sox skipper Alex Cora, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/mets-carlos-beltran-played-key-role-in-astros-sign-stealing-report/">played key roles in the sign-stealing system</a>. Beltran has repeatedly denied the charges, telling The Post that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/carlos-beltran-doubles-down-as-mets-unfazed-over-mlb-sign-stealing-scandal/">“there is nothing illegal about studying your opposite team.”</a></p>
