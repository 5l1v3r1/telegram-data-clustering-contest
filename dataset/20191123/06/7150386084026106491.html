      <p>Trade analyst Taran Adarsh released the latest Box Office figures of <i>Bala</i> on Twitter. His post read, ‚Äú#Bala is üíØ Not Out‚Ä¶ Continues to attract ample footfalls at multiplexes‚Ä¶ [Week 3] Fri 1.35 cr. Total: ‚Çπ 100.15 cr. #India biz.‚Äù (sic)</p>

      <p><i>Bala</i> collected a total of Rs 72.24 crore in its first week after registering an opening of Rs 10.15 crore, the biggest opening for an Ayushmann starrer. The film went on to show a good performance in the coming days and had a steady run at the Box Office. Here‚Äôs the week one Box Office breakup of <i>Bala</i>:</p>
      <p>Friday: Rs 10.15 crore<br/>Saturday: Rs 15.73 crore<br/>Sunday: Rs 18.07 crore<br/>Monday: Rs 8.26 crore<br/>Tuesday: Rs 9.52 crore<br/>Wednesday: Rs 5.20 crore<br/>Thursday: Rs 5.31 crore<br/>Total: Rs 72.24 crore</p>
      <p>Here‚Äôs the week two breakup of the film starring <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/yami-gautam/">Yami Gautam</a> and <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/bhumi-pednekar/">Bhumi Pednekar</a> with Ayushmann:</p>
      <p>Friday: Rs 3.76 crore<br/>Saturday:¬† Rs 6.73 crore<br/>Sunday: Rs 8.01 crore<br/>Monday: Rs 2.25 crore<br/>Tuesday: Rs 2.05 crore<br/>Wednesday: Rs 1.96 crore<br/>Thursday: Rs 1.80 crore<br/>Total: Rs 26.56 crore</p>
      <p>The week three began on a decent note and put the film in the coveted Rs 100 crore club. <i>Bala</i> is still running at the ticket window and it would be interesting to see how much does it mint after exhausting its run considering <i>Pagalpanti</i> has hit the screens and <i>Marjaavaan</i> that was released last week is also showing a decent business.</p>
