        <b>Sonko emerges with damning allegations as vipendiree takes a new twist</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nairobi governor Mike Sonko has hit out at the County senator Johnsn Sakaja, alleging that he is among legislators who pocketed Ksh 5 Million from a popular city land grabber.</p>
      <p>Taking to Facebook, Sonko stated that the land grabber dished out the Ksh 5 Million bribe through the ousted Nairobi county assembly majority leader Abdi Guyo who is also the Matopeni MCA.</p>
      <p>The county boss who is under the radar of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) alleged that Makadara MP George Aladwa met Guyo at his town house and collected the bribe to be shared among legislators, including Sakaja.</p>

        <p>"The question to ask is, what changed between Thursday 14th November 2019 and Thursday 21st November 2019 for Sakaja to change his tune. Well, what changed is that Sakaja received Ksh1.5 Million from the Ksh5 Million collected by Aladwa from Guyo, Aladwa kept Ksh1.5 Million for himself," slammed Sonko.</p>
        <p>The governor alleged that other legislators ended up receiving Ksh 250000 each after Aladwa and Sakaja shortchanged them, lying to them that they had only received Ksh 2 Million from the land grabber.</p>

          <p>â€œ"Our beloved Nairobi MPs received Ksh250,000 from the landgrabber through the ousted leader of impunity and corruption who is also Matopeni MCA.</p>
          <p>"Needless to say, reliable sources have intimated that the Matopeni Mca received Ksh10 Million from the Land Grabber but only delivered Ksh5 Million and kept the rest for himself just like Sakaja and Aladwa kept Ksh3 Million between the two of them," added the Governor.</p>
