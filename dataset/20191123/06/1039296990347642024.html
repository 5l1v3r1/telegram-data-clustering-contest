      <p>Set to become the flagship MG offering in the country, the D90 will be a large, three-row SUV like no other.</p>
      <p>Morris Garages made its India debut with the Hector midsize SUV earlier this year. Aimed at the heart of the SUV segment, the Hector has gotten off to a flying start, registering retails of 9,670 units until October 2019, thereby carving out a 1.77 percent utility vehicle market share for its brand. Expecting to build on the momentum, MG has planned a flurry of SUVs for the Indian market in the coming months.</p>
      <p>First up is the all-electric ZS EV that is slated to be revealed on December 5 and go on sale in January 2020. The first half of 2020 will also see the launch of a six-seat version of the Hector. And, <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mg-maxus-d90-suv-india-bound-by-diwali-2020-412933"><b>as we had previously reported</b></a>, MG is also working towards bringing the Maxus D90 to our shores in the following months. <b><a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/mg-maxus-d90-seen-testing-in-india-414920">The big and brawny SUV was recently spotted testing on Indian soil</a></b>, which lends credence to the news of its imminent arrival in our market.</p>
      <p>So, what is the Maxus D90 and what can we expect from the upcoming MG SUV? Let’s take a closer look.      </p>
      <h3>It will be a rugged three-row SUV</h3>
      <p>The D90 is the flagship offering of the Chinese utility vehicle maker Maxus, a subsidiary of MG’s parent company SAIC, and is also sold under the LDV brand name in markets like Australia. Built on a light truck platform, it sports a chunky design and a bold, upright stance. Measuring 5,005mm in length, 1,932mm in width and 1,875mm in height, with a wheelbase of 2,950mm, the massive D90 eclipses its potential rivals in the Indian market on almost every dimension.</p>
      <p>The Chinese-spec Maxus gets a double wishbone suspension at the front and a five-link setup at the rear, 210mm of ground clearance and standard 19-inch alloy wheels (which can be bumped up to massive 21-inch units on the top-end trim). In its domestic market, the D90 can also be specced with a variety of seating configurations, though the India-bound SUV is expected to sport a three-row layout with a seven- or eight-seat configuration.    </p>
      <h3>It will be a feature-rich package</h3>
      <p>In its domestic market, the range-topping variant of the D90 comes equipped with adaptive LED headlights, LED DRLs, a panoramic sunroof, heated wing mirrors, gesture controlled tailgate, ambient lighting, three-zone automatic air-conditioning, an 8.0-inch multi-info instrument cluster display and a 12.3-inch touchscreen infotainment system. The neatly designed cabin boasts of leather upholstery and powered front seats with heating, ventilation and massage functions.    </p>
      <p>Safety is taken care of by up to six airbags, brake assist, ESP, hill-hold control, hill-descent control, a tire pressure monitoring system, front and rear parking sensors and a 360-degree camera. Following the success of the kitted-out Hector in our market, MG will be working towards mirroring the move and offering class-leading equipment levels on the India-bound D90 to differentiate it from traditional rivals in the segment.  </p>
      <h3>It will get petrol as well as diesel powertrains</h3>
      <p>Despite being a large SUV, the D90 is sold globally with a sole 224hp, 2.0-litre turbo-petrol engine with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic gearbox, and the same can be expected to make it to the Indian market too. However, MG will also add a diesel powertrain to the India-spec model. Prospective customers will be able to choose between rear-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive configurations, and top-spec trims will come with selectable drive modes (sport, eco, rock, sand, mud, snow and auto) to enhance the body-on-frame SUV’s off-road abilities.  </p>
      <h3>It will debut by late 2020</h3>
      <p>Expect MG to debut the D90 SUV in India under a different moniker. When launched in late 2020, it will be positioned above the six-seat Hector, making it the brand’s flagship offering in the country. With estimated prices in the range of Rs 27-35 lakh (ex-showroom), the D90 will lock horns with the venerable Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endeavour, Mahindra Alturas G4 and the Isuzu MU-X in our market.</p>
