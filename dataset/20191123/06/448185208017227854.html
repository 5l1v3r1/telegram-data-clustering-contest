      <p>STAFF REPORTER</p>
      <p><b>GUWAHATI:</b> An extension of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) protest since the past three weeks was seen here in the city when students of different colleges and universities carried out a demonstration near Nehru Park on Thursday. The cause behind the protest is the hike in hostel fees of JNU students.</p>
      <p>The new hostel charges require students to pay a service charge of Rs. 1,700 per month which previously did not exist. Rent for a single room has been increased from Rs 20 per month to Rs 600 per month. Rent for a double-sharing room has increased from Rs 10 per month to Rs 300 per month. The one-time (refundable) mess security deposit was increased from Rs 5,500 to Rs 12,000.</p>
