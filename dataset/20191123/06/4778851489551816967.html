      <h1>The value of Scotland reaching Euro 2020 is revealed</h1>

        <b>Scotland will play for the most lucrative prize of their international history in the Euro 2020 play-offs next March.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Steve Clarke’s squad will earn the Scottish FA at least €9.25 million in prize money – just under £8 million at current exchange rates – if they can overcome Israel and then beat either Norway or Serbia to claim a place in the Euro 2020 finals.</p>
      <p>Scotland learned the path they must negotiate to end their 22-year absence from a major tournament finals when the play-offs draw was held at Uefa headquarters in Nyon yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>It was a case of mixed fortunes for the Scots who will feel confident they can defeat Israel at Hampden in the semi-final on Thursday, 26 March but have missed out on home advantage if they reach the final – which will be in either Oslo or Belgrade on Tuesday, 31 March.</p>
      <p>But the incentive on offer could hardly be greater, both in terms of the country’s prestige after so much time spent among international football’s also-rans, and with the financial rewards on offer.</p>
      <p>When Scotland last played at a major tournament finals, in the 1998 World Cup in France, they received prize money from Fifa of just over £3m. That sum is worth around £5.2m today, considerably less than would pour into the Scottish FA coffers next summer if Clarke can book a place at Euro 2020, for which Glasgow is a host city, and where his team would play two of their three group stage matches at Hampden.</p>
      <p>On top of the €9.25m Scotland would receive from Uefa just for participating in the finals, teams will earn an additional €1m for each group stage victory and €500,000 for a draw.</p>
      <p>If Scotland could progress beyond the group stage of a major tournament for the first time in their history, they would pick up a further €1.5m for making it to the last 16.</p>
      <p>For now, simply reaching the finals remains a tall order for Clarke’s squad, with Serbia installed as the bookies’ favourites to qualify from the play-offs after Friday’s draw. But the Scotland head coach has called for unity and optimism ahead of the crucial assignment in March.</p>
      <p>“This is the time to believe,” said Clarke. “We have just finished what was a difficult campaign, having experienced a turbulent few years for players, fans and managers alike.</p>
      <p>“It’s now time to channel the positivity following our recent results and focus on the semi-final in March first and foremost.”</p>
