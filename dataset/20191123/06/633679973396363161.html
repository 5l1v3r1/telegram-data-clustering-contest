      <p>Port Elizabeth police have arrested three suspects and recovered four firearms, two replica firearms and a replica gas pistol in the city's northern areas.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Colonel Pricilla Naidu says members of the Anti-Gang Unit executed a search warrant at a house in Kwazakele on Friday, where a 35-year-old man was arrested for the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.  </p>
      <p>A 9mm pistol and 7 rounds of ammunition were recovered.</p>
      <p>The firearm was reported stolen in Mount Road in April 2018.</p>
      <p>Naidu says a .22 pistol with no serial number was seized by Flying Squad and K9 unit members while patrolling in Durban Road, Korsten on Friday when they spotted an Opel Kadett attempting to avoid a Vehicle Check Point.</p>
      <p>She says they stopped the vehicle, and the driver attempted to remove the firearm from his waist but he was apprehended.</p>
      <p>In the third incident on Friday, police received information of a firearm hidden in a gutter on the roof of a house in Booysens Park, and a .22 Remington rifle and a 9mm replica gas pistol were found.</p>
      <p>No-one was arrested.</p>
      <p>Colonel Naidu says police also followed up on information and searched a house in Bethelsdorp later in the day, where a 16-year-old was arrested after a revolver with no serial number was recovered.  </p>
      <p>All those arrested will appear in court on Monday.</p>
