      <h1>Jose Mourinho, John McGinn, Rangers and 27 things you can do for the price of a Scotland ticket</h1>
      <h2>Kris Boyd Special? Hampden binoculars? OldFirmFacts helps you spend £27</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Old Firm Facts</a></address>
      <p>At 7.45pm On Tuesday night, the temperature in Glasgow was 3°. It was raining. You’d probably had a tough day at work, seeing as Tuesday is the only day of the week worse than Monday.</p>
      <p>Those conditions scream ‘straight home, heating up, staunch union jack jammies on’ to most people, but there is a subset of society with a more perverse outlook. Thousands of them could be found in Glasgow’s south side, having paid £27 for the privilege of watching the sides ranked 53rd and 121st in the world contest a dead rubber.</p>
      <p>A total of 19,500 people chose to spend their Tuesday night this way. As unpalatable a method of spending an evening as it might seem to many, there’s no doubt that considerably more tickets would have been sold if the price was more reasonable.</p>
      <p>I mean, you COULD have spent £27 for the right to have a running track between you and Scott McKenna backing off Baktiyar Zaynutdinov. Or, you could have spent it on any of these 27 things that cost the same or less than a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> v Kazakhstan ticket.</p>
      <p>1. Borat on DVD, so you can watch something involving Kazakhstan that’s entertaining from the start rather than just the last 45 minutes. Treat yourself to a green mankini for the full experience. That still leaves £19.58 for a takeaway.</p>
      <p>2. One ticket for The Shining sequel Doctor Sleep at Cineworld, if you’re looking for a less harrowing experience than watching the Scottish national team. Throw in a large popcorn, large soft drink, nachos and an alcoholic beverage.</p>
      <p>3. Tickets for some of the Scotland Women’s Euro 2021 qualifiers. They’re the ones who qualify for tournaments.</p>
      <p>4. Launch a consortium to take over Adidas, after which you can burn down the warehouse which stores the new international kit.</p>
      <p>5. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a>, 27 times (Look, if I didn’t say it here there would be 20 guys with ‘67’ at the end of their Twitter handles saying it in the replies).</p>
      <p>6. A nice bouquet of flowers for Ethel Smith to say thanks for letting her husband Walter take the Scotland job again later this year.</p>
      <p>7. A France ‘98 sticker album plus a set of 13 Scotland stickers. It’s a handy reminder of the last time the men’s team qualified for a major tournament, and also brings into sharp focus the fact that Christian Dailly has played in more major international tournaments than Champions League-winner Andy Robertson. Throw in Archie McPherson’s book ‘Adventures in the Golden Age: Scotland in the World Cup Finals 1974-1998’ and then use the remaining £4 to buy a meal deal you can enjoy while reading it on your lunch break.</p>
      <p>8. Therapy to teach you coping strategies for your Euro 2020 qualifying campaign PTSD.</p>
      <p>9. Save the £27 and use it to buy a half-pint at next year’s TRNSMT festival.</p>
      <p>10. Train to Edinburgh and an underground ghost tour.</p>
      <p>11. A ticket for the Scotland game which you then give to Katie Hopkins, who must attend and stay for the full 90 minutes otherwise an alternative punishment will be found.</p>
      <p>12. Get a taxi to Hampden, mount an SFA coup and instigate a reasonable pricing structure for the Nations League playoff</p>
      <p>13. Failing that, at least pay for two SFA members to visit Edinburgh and find out what Easter Road and Tynecastle look like.</p>
      <p>14. A round of golf for Scott McKenna at Trump International Scotland on March 26th. No, hang on, he’s already an ambassador. An ambassador for Trump.</p>
      <p>15. 0.00027% of Scott McKenna’s £10m transfer fee.</p>
      <p>16. Supplies for the underground bunker you’ve set up in preparation for Jo Swinson’s nuclear strike.</p>
      <p>17. Binoculars, so if you are going to attend a game at Hampden you can at least see the action.</p>
      <p>18. Pay the Conservative Party fact check account to debunk the idea that £27 is an acceptable price to pay for Scotland v Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>19. Hire Prince Andrew’s PR team. There’s no way they can charge more than £27 with a straight face.</p>
      <p>20. Stick £27 on the date of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho’s</a> first passive-aggressive comment about Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. I’ve got March 3rd 2020.</p>
      <p>21. Enough plasters and ibuprofen to keep Stevie Naismith safe between now and the playoffs.</p>
      <p>22. Pay for a carryout on your way to a rugby match. On the plus side you won’t get it confiscated what with it not being a football match, but on the down side you’re going to a rugby match.</p>
      <p>23. Keep warm at the football with one of the discounted items from Derek McInnes’ Autumn/Winter 2019 Gilet Collection.</p>
      <p>24. Taxis for the Scotrail employees who this week tweeted “I’m not going to discuss ‘what ifs’ with you, Josh” and “Is it a major issue buying from the ticket machine or booking offices before getting on the train, Fraser?” in response to perfectly reasonable questions from commuters.</p>
      <p>25. Or give them both a £13.50 bonus, depending on your perspective.</p>
      <p>26. 0.225% of the ‘Kris Boyd Special’ at a hair transplant clinic</p>
      <p>27. Save the £27 until next summer and buy a congratulatory round for John McGinn after his hat-trick in the Euro 2020 final.</p>
