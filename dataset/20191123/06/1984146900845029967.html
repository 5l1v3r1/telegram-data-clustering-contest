      <h2>Sunderland boss Phil Parkinson was impressed with Brandon Taylor's man of the match performance in the FA Cup at Gillingham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Brandon Taylor has proved he can cut it at first-team level, according to Phil Parkinson.</p>
      <p>With injuries and international call-ups severely depleting <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland's</a> options for the midweek FA Cup first round replay at Gillingham, 20-year-old academy centre-back <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brandon-taylor">Taylor</a> stepped up from the U23 squad to start the biggest game so far in his fledgling career, with his previous first-team experience extending to just one start and one sub appearance in the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>And Taylor demonstrated he was up to the task, turning in an excellent performance as part of a back three - with manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Parkinson</a> singling him out as arguably the Black Cats' man of the match, despite seeing his side lose 1-0 in extra-time.</p>
      <p>Parkinson says youngsters such as Taylor, and 21-year-old central defender Jack Bainbridge who played half-an-hour as a substitute against the Gills, are at the stage where they should be ready to break out of the U23 squad if they are to make the grade in senior football.</p>
      <p>"I was very pleased with Brandon. I thought he was probably our best player on the night," said Parkinson, whose Sunderland side takes on League One promotion rivals Coventry City at the Stadium of Light this afternoon.</p>
      <p>"He loved every minute of it, but it was a tough game to play in because Gillingham play a certain way where they get the ball forward very early, long throws coming into the box, a lot of set-plays, and that's a totally different type of game to the ones he has experienced at U23 level.</p>

      <p>"But I don't think he could do a lot more to show that he can play.</p>
      <p>"When you look at these lads like Brandon or Jack [Bainbridge], they are not 17 or 18 they are 20, 21, or 22 - they are at a point where they are either ready, and they are going to be good enough, or they are not.</p>
      <p>"Brandon and Jack are in that category and all they can do is take their chance when they get it, and they did that on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"And Brandon certainly did that over the full 120 minutes - he played like a man."</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conor-mclaughlin">Conor McLaughlin</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tom-flanagan">Tom Flanagan</a> returning from international duty, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jordan-willis">Jordan Willis</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joel-lynch">Joel Lynch</a> fit again after missing the Gillingham game due to injury, and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alim-ozturk">Alim Ozturk</a> - who played on Tuesday night despite being nowhere near match-fit - edging his way back, there is plenty of competition in central defence.</p>
      <p>But Taylor trained with the first-team squad yesterday and is now seen as a player who can be called upon when needed.</p>
      <p>Parkinson said: "He trained with us this morning. With the lads coming back from international duty we have more options, and I have to give Alim credit as well because we asked him to play the other night when he was way off match fitness and yet he did very well."</p>
