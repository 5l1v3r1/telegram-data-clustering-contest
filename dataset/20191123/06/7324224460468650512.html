      <p>The annual Christmas tree festival at St Luke's Church is set to attract hundreds of people through its doors to see the magical displays.</p>
      <p>It was originally set up by the church's treasurer as a way to raise additional funds for the church.</p>
      <p>Now in its ninth year, the event sees community groups, charities and businesses decorate a tree to go on display over three days with money raised supporting charitable causes and St Luke's Church.</p>
      <p>Janet Bailey, 76, festival co-ordinator, said: "I've been a member of the church for many years and have been involved in the festival since it started and each year it's got bigger and brighter with more people getting involved.</p>
      <p>"We've already had over 100 people visit us when we opened the church this morning.</p>
      <p>"It's a way to get people to come into church who would not normally come, it's not religious in any way, we just wanted to get the community together and involved in what we do."</p>
      <p>Some of the groups who have a tree at this year's festival include Guides, Friends of Cannock Chase, Acorns Children's Hospice, Marie Curie and local schools.</p>
      <p>A number of them have decorated their trees with a twist, with The British Legion's tree being covered in red poppies and Redhill Primary School's tree being made entirely from donated food items.</p>
      <p>Preparations for the festive extravaganza started much earlier in the year, Janet added: "We start planning and designing the theme in the summer and as soon as the Christmas items are in the shops I go out and buy them so we don't miss out.</p>
      <p>"There's a team of a dozen of us who are all members of the church who organise the festival, this year it has taken us three days to get all of the decorations up."</p>
      <p>The whole church has been transformed into a winter wonderland, with this year's theme being frozen, to coincide with the Disney sequel's release.</p>
      <p>Sticking with the theme, the church's porch has become a frozen forest and is covered in icey decorations and white lights.</p>
      <p>The festival is free of charge, but donations are welcome.</p>
      <p>It will be held at St Luke's until November 23 and is open from 10:30am to 4:30pm each day.</p>
