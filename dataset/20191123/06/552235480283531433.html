      <h1>Bevis Mugabi up for Motherwell challenge after claiming he kept Sadio Mane in his 'back pocket'</h1>
      <h2>Defender has signed a new deal at Fir Park not so long after facing Mane on international duty.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>Bold Bevis Mugabi reckons he can trouser a big money move from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> one day - after keeping Liverpool ace Sadio Mane in his back pocket on international duty.</p>
      <p>The Uganda international might only have four top tier appearances under his belt since moving to Fir Park in the summer but he’s lacking nothing when it comes to self belief.</p>
      <p>The defender, who penned a new 18 month deal yesterday, was at the heart of his country’s African Cup of Nations run just weeks before moving to the Steelmen.</p>
      <p>And a clash against Senegal brought him in direct opposition with his former Southampton team mate Mane.</p>
      <p>Despite the Anfield frontman scoring the only goal of the game Mugabi insists he had him under control.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old is just back in Scotland from another international double header against Malawi and Burkino Faso and asked about the big names he faced he said: “I was probably the biggest one to be honest!</p>
      <p>“I played against Sadio Mane in the last 16 of the African Cup of Nations and that was a good experience. I think he’s still in my pocket!</p>
      <p>“Maybe it will get me a move to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>“His sharpness in the game and his decision-making was so much quicker than everyone else’s, and that’s borne out in the amount of goals that he’s scored.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s the only difference between being an elite player and an average player, that quick thought process and the sharpness that you can carry it out.</p>
      <p>“I was at Southampton with him as well, so I’ve seen his progression from being at Southampton to making that step up to Liverpool, and now he’s probably one of the best players in the world.</p>

      <p>“I definitely feel that I have the attributes to make that step up too. I just need the right coaching, and I feel like I’ve developed here as a player already with the gaffer’s style of play.</p>
      <p>“As long as I keep getting game-time and improving every day in training, I’m sure I can make that step up to a higher division.”</p>
      <p>Mugabi might not come up against the calibre of Mane every week in the Premiership but the former Yeovil Town stopper is well aware of the threat of Hibs striker Christian Doidge ahead of this afternoon’s clash at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>“I like playing against him,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good striker, he’s proven that in League Two and got his move to Hibs, so it’s going to be a tough game.</p>

      <p>“He’s got a good mix of physicality and being a good finisher, as we saw with Forest Green, so it’s going to be a good test.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t watch too much Scottish football when I was back home, but from what I’ve heard he’s now settling in and it will be a tough test for us.</p>
      <p>“You’ve seen already this season that we’re not holding back against any team.</p>
      <p>“We’re going out there for the win, we’re not going to settle for a draw, and that’s what the gaffer has instilled in us.”</p>
      <p>Well boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson</a> has backed Mugabi to kick on from his impressive start in Scotland.</p>

      <p>“Bevis is confident but not in a bad way – he’s not arrogant but he has that self-belief and an assurance about him.</p>
      <p>“He isn’t fazed by playing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> because when he goes on international duty he’s playing in front of 60-70,000 people in Egypt and facing Mo Salah and people like that.”</p>
      <p>Robinson is the odds on favourite to be the next Northern Ireland manager and was also among the frontrunners for the Hearts job but insists there’s been no developments in either case.</p>
      <p>Robinson says he is focused on Hibs who will have Jack Ross in charge for the first time.</p>
      <p>He said: “Hibs have spent a lot of money to get some very good players but we’re the ones who’re playing well. I don’t know Jack particularly well because I’ve never played against one of his sides.</p>
      <p>“But he has a very good reputation and, when I have met him, he seems like a very intelligent man and he has a good reputation within the game. I’m sure he’ll be a good appointment.”</p>
