      <h1>Lyon clash will be a test of Leinster's manhood, says Leo Cullen</h1>
      <h2>With that in mind, Cullen has turned to the experience of Rob Kearney, Tadhg Furlong, Scott Fardy and Rob Henshaw</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T06:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Leo Cullen claims Leinster's Lyon visit will be a test of his team's manhood.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, Cullen has turned to the experience of Rob Kearney, Tadhg Furlong, Scott Fardy and Rob Henshaw, who all return to the starting line-up for today's encounter at the Matmut Stadium de Gerland.</p>
      <p>"We love the home games, but when you go to France it's a bit more of a test of our manhood, so to speak," stated the Leinster head coach.</p>
      <p>"Can we stay controlled in the environment with all the chaotic bits going around; trumpets and bands and crowd noise and cheering?</p>
      <p>Opposition flying into you, maximum pressure all the time. Them playing on the edge. Can we think clearly with all of those going on in the background?".</p>
      <p>Having said that, Lyon have lost their last four home games in Europe - having won nine of their previous 11.</p>
      <p>Leinster, by contrast, have only lost once in their last eight games on French soil.</p>
      <p>But Cullen is wary of the fact that Lyon, who are the Top 14 pace-setters, lost their pool opener in Northampton last week. This is a must-win for the French club.</p>
      <p>"It can be a turnaround game - and that's when French teams are very dangerous," he surmised.</p>
      <p>"Last weekend, they rested some of their key guys. They have such a deep squad anyway.</p>
      <p>"They've signed guys like (Xavier) Chiocci, crafty operators from the Top 14 who have been around the block and know how to get the job done."</p>
      <p>"Their tournament lies on the line and that's how dangerous they can be."</p>

      <p>That one loss in eight on french soil happened on their last visit a year ago, so there's been no problem with the Blues' mindset this week after their opening bonus point home win over Benetton.</p>
      <p>Leinster went to Toulouse as reigning champions but there were celebratory scenes at the end between the team and their supporters after winning by a single point.</p>
      <p>"We'd seen a lot of footage of Toulouse and seen some of the threats they have and said there was actually lots of opportunities," recalled Cullen.</p>
      <p>"Then, you actually get there and there's the cauldron atmosphere and it's a very different team to what you analysed on the footage.</p>
      <p>"Then, when Toulouse win at the end, you see Ugo Mola's reaction and the players scoring their tries, how they celebrate. The crowd, the noise, everything.</p>
      <p>"This is a big deal, it is a big deal to them, it looks like, to play against us which is in one way a compliment because you can see how much it actually does mean to them, that they're not making it up.</p>
      <p>"That's what we've tried to focus on this week, understanding what it means to these guys when they win against Leinster.</p>
      <p>"It's a positive sign that they're treating the game like that to that extent.</p>
      <p>"For some of our guys it is going to be a great step, a great game. This is why you get involved in the game".</p>
