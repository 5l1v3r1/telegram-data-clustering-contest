      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the development of Electronic Based Customs known as E-Customs for the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali (rtd) announced on Friday.</p>
      <p>Speaking at  the graduation of Senior Course three of Nigeria Customs Command and Staff College, Gwagwalada, Abuja Ali said the deployment of technology would go a long way in enhancing activities of the service.</p>
      <p>He explained that E-Customs would change the manner the NCS operates.</p>
      <p>According to him, when fully deployed, the entire processes including local administration, clearing of goods and services will be done electronically.</p>
      <p>His words:”Export and import processing will be paperless.</p>
      <p>“We need to up our game in our knowledge of computer because in the next one and half years, if you don’t have knowledge in computer, you cannot function in customs.</p>

      <p>“Your performance evaluation report will not be written on paper. You will fill it online and your superior will assess you online.</p>
      <p>“We need to tell ourselves that even if it will take you through private studies to learn, do so, you must learn how to use computer because everything will be fully computerized,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>The customs boss also said  that the NCS board had approved the change in name of the institution from Command and Staff College to Training and Doctrine Command.</p>
      <p>He also said that the college would serve as component that would coordinate and ensure that other training colleges of the service were fully articulated.</p>
