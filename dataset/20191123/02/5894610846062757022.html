      <p>I have to be careful. The daughter's in the house. She moved out a while back - and moved in with her partner, Keith. I miss her and the little grandson, but I've got used to being able to say and shout anything I want.</p>
      <p>You know that saying, 'My heart sings'? Well, that's what my heart does whenever I hear the daughter's key in the front door. And I always know it's her key - ever since I brought her down to the hardware shop so she could watch the lad there cutting her own front door key, a few days before she started secondary school. I hear her at the door and, like I said, my heart sings. My heart hasn't a note in its head but that's not the point; it tries its best.</p>
      <p>But I have to be careful. I consider myself to be a tolerant, liberal, easy-going man. But the daughter puts me right.</p>
      <p>- You can't say that, she says - a lot.</p>
      <p>- Why not?</p>
      <p>This time, she comes into the house just in time to hear me shouting at Ronan Collins.</p>
      <p>- Actually, like, she tells me. - I could hear you down at the shops - inside the Spar. And you can't say it, like.</p>
      <p>Ronan Collins isn't in the kitchen with us, by the way. He's on the radio. I can't even remember what I said now; I shout at Ronan Collins most days.</p>
      <p>- Remind me, I say.</p>
      <p>In fact, I do remember what I said but the daughter does what I'm reliably informed is an excellent impression of me in full flight, so I'm pretending I left my memory upstairs with my reading glasses.</p>
      <p>- What did I say? I ask her.</p>
      <p>- You're only an oul' one, Collins, an' you can shove your requests up your hoe-well!</p>
      <p>It's amazing, really, how she does it. You're expecting Judy Garland but she opens her mouth and it's Louis Armstrong.</p>
      <p>- What's wrong with that? I ask her. - Telling Ronan where to shove his requests isn't sexist - is it?</p>
      <p>- No, she says. - That's just childish, like.</p>
      <p>- Well said, love, says the wife.</p>
      <p>She's in the house somewhere but she isn't in the kitchen. But now that I think of it, she isn't in the house at all. I remember now: she grabbed the car key about an hour ago and said she'd be home in time for Newsnight.</p>
      <p>- You can't call Ronan Collins an oul' one, says the daughter.</p>
      <p>I listen out for the wife - even though I know she isn't here. But I hear nothing more.</p>
      <p>- He is old, but, I say.</p>
      <p>- 'Oul' one' is a degrading term for an elderly woman.</p>
      <p>- No, it isn't.</p>
      <p>- Yes, it is.</p>
      <p>- Not really.</p>
      <p>- You're not an elderly woman, she says. - So you don't own that particular claim, like.</p>
      <p>I listen out for the wife: nothing.</p>
      <p>- And by suggesting, the daughter continues, - that Ronan is, like, not a real man - and big deal, by the way - it's even more degrading to elderly women cos it suggests that men are superior to women.</p>
      <p>- Okay, I say.</p>
      <p>She's right. I'm not sure why, but I raise my hands; I surrender.</p>
      <p>- But, I say. - I only called Ronan an oul' one -</p>
      <p>- You can't say that.</p>
      <p>- Grand - but I only said it because of the song he put on.</p>
      <p>- What song?</p>
      <p>It's still on. If I Could Turn Back Time. Cher is still charging through it. She must be exhausted.</p>
      <p>- I hate that bloody song, I tell the daughter. - And that's why I was shouting at Ronan. But really, when you analyse it properly, I was shouting at Cher. Because she's singing it. And she is an oul' one - she can hold back time for as long as she f**kin' wants.</p>
      <p>- It's still degrading.</p>
      <p>- Cher won't mind, love, I say.</p>
      <p>The daughter seems happy enough. She's made her point.</p>
      <p>- And she's a gay icon, I say. - So fair play to her - she's a great oul' one.</p>
      <p>It's how I'm getting through life: I'm listening to the daughter. I hear or see something and I ask myself: what would the daughter make of this? I've been doing it now for a few years and it's serving me quite well. I'd be a bit lost if I didn't have the daughter's conscience to hold me by the hand.</p>
      <p>But Daughter-Land can be a very puritanical place. I called Boris Johnson a bollix a few days ago and she told me it was sexist. Which is ridiculous - but the way she was staring at me, I was half-thinking of writing an apology to Johnson. The bollix.</p>
      <p>Now, in the kitchen, Cher finally gives up trying to hold back time and Ronan announces U2.</p>
      <p>- Ah, not those old white men, says the daughter.</p>
      <p>It's my turn to stare.</p>
      <p>God, it's great.</p>
