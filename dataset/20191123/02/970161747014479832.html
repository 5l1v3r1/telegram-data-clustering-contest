      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> has had his say on claims he cheated on his ex-girlfriend Gabby Allen.</p>
      <p>Myles first got together with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> alum Gabby, 27, in September 2018. They dated for nearly a year, and had been living together, before she confirmed their split to her followers on Instagram.</p>
      <p>At the time, it was claimed Myles had been unfaithful but speaking ahead of his jungle debut, the singer has had his say on the rumours.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> that he and Gabby had been on a ‘break’ and he had messaged a previous ex girlfriend of his. He claims he and the ex never actually met up, but she had messaged Gabby to tell her the two had been talking.</p>
      <p>‘We were on a break at the time when I messaged this girl,’ Myles told the paper.</p>

      <p>‘I shouldn’t have done it, even though me and Gabby weren’t speaking at the time and I moved home, but it was a general conversation.</p>

      <p>‘It was a stupid mistake and I stopped speaking to her when we started getting back together, but by that time she’s messaged Gabby and said we’d been speaking.’</p>
      <p>‘Nothing happened,’ Myles, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-breaks-tears-wakes-jungle-homesick-11197585/">who is now starring on I’m A Celeb alongside Jacqueline Jossa</a> and Caitlyn Jenner, said. ‘I didn’t even meet up with her.’</p>

      <p>Viewers recently saw Myles discussing relationships with his campmates and revealed he is worried about finding a ‘meaningful’ relationship.</p>
      <p>While Gabby said she hasn’t been watching her ex in the jungle, she was made aware of his comments and was quick to hit back on social media.</p>
      <p>She wrote: ‘Apparently he was on about “meaningful relationships”. I’m not sure the guy knows what he’s on about tbh.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t know cheating, lying and a whole load of other [poo emoji] came under “meaningful”. Who knows? Each to their own?’</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>
