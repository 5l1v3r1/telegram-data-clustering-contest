      <p>In a surprising move, Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday took oath as Maharashtra Chief Minister for the second term. The interesting fact about the new government is NCP’s Ajit Pawar who took oath as deputy CM of Maharashtra. The news has come to a great shock to political pundits who were predicting NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena alliance government in the state. But the latest development has brought a twist in the Maharashtra political saga. On Friday, it was Ajit Pawar who had announced that the new government in the state would be led by Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. The oath was administered by Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari at Raj Bhawan.</p>
      <p>After BJP and Shiv Sena failed to form the government in the state. Then, Shiv Sena approached to NCP and Congress for the government formation. The deliberations between the three parties had almost reached the final stage and the parties were inched closer to announce the alliance in the state today.</p>
