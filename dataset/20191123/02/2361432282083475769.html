      <h1>Michael Jackson Biopic in the Works With ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’ Producer</h1>
      <h2>The project is not set up at a studio at this point</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:42:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/umberto-gonzalez/" target="_blank">Umberto Gonzalez</a></address>
      <p>Producer Graham King (“Bohemian Rhapsody”) has secured the film rights from the Michael Jackson estate to make an authorized biopic on the late pop icon’s life, an individual with knowledge of the project told TheWrap. Additionally, King’s GK Films will have access to all Jackson music and has retained three-time Oscar-nominated writer John Logan to write the screenplay.</p>
      <p>The project is not set up at a studio at this point. The film will span the entire singer’s career and is not intended to be a sanitized look at Jackson’s life, who was accused of child sexual abuse in the HBO documentary “Leaving Neverland.” A <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/michael-jackson-broadway-musical-mj-casts-ephraim-sykes-as-king-of-pop/">Broadway</a> musical is also currently in the works as well.</p>
      <p>The Jackson project is not the only musical biopic King has in the works. Last month, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-bee-gees-biopic-in-the-works-at-paramount-with-bohemian-rhapsody-producer/">Paramount purchased the life rights to the family estate of The Bee Gees’ Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb</a> on King’s behalf. Sister, the new company from Stacey Snider, Elisabeth Murdoch and “Chernobyl” producer Jane Featherstone, is aboard as either a co-producer or a co-financier the film, two other individuals of knowledge told TheWrap.</p>
