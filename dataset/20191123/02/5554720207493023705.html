      <p>This has effectively brought an end to the month-long political stalemate in the second largest state of India after last month’s assembly results were inconclusive.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra tweeted congratulating Fadnavis on becoming the chief minister once again. He wrote, “Congratulations to Devendra Fadnavis ji and Ajit Pawar ji on taking oath as the CM and Deputy CM of Maharashtra respectively. I am confident they will work diligently for the bright future of Maharashtra.”</p>

      <p>Fadnavis, for his part, was quoted by ANI as saying, “People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, as a result President’s rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable govt not a ‘khichdi’ govt.”</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar said that ‘from the result day to this day no party was able to form the government’ adding that ‘Maharashtra was facing many problems including farmer issues, so we decided to form a stable government.’</p>
      <p>The news of Fadnavis taking oath as the state’s chief minister once again has come as a huge surprise in the light of the NCP and the Congress holding talks in Mumbai on the support to the Shiv Sena to form the government.</p>
      <p>Ahmed Patel of the Congress and Sharad Pawar of the NCP had said that the talks will continue on Saturday morning.</p>
