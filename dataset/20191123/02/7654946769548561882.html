      <p>President Trump on Friday said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would win in a “landslide” if he decides to enter a Kansas Senate race.</p>
      <p>Trump, speaking on “Fox &amp; Friends,” lauded Pompeo for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/pompeo-us-to-soften-its-position-on-west-bank-settlements/">his work in the State Department</a>, then added he thought he would make a successful Senator.</p>
      <p>“Mike has done an incredible job. You know, I have an incredible cabinet,” Trump said, responding to a question from co-host Brian Kilmeade.</p>
      <p>“Mike would win easily in Kansas. Great state. And it’s a Trump state. He’d win easily,” Trump added.</p>
      <p>“If he thought there was a chance of losing that seat, I think he would do that, and he would win in a landslide because they love him in Kansas,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The Senate race in Kansas is for the seat that retiring GOP senator Pat Roberts will leave open.</p>
