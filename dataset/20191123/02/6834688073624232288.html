      <p>Founded in 2015, Mrs Wordsmith claims to be on a mission to teach every child in the world the “10,000 words” they need to succeed. The company shared:</p>
      <blockquote>“By building on our brilliantly illustrated content &amp; pedagogy, we are launching the Epic Word Adventure to make video games more valuable – a low-stress way for kids to constantly expand their vocabulary while playing a fun game they love. We use data-science to teach children vital vocabulary to support them in achieving in national exams, and in digesting the books they read, with the ultimate aim of improving their reading age and exam results.”</blockquote>
      <p>Mrs Wordsmith also reported that its unit growth has been strong, with 38% compound MoM growth this year. The company noted that in 2019 alone, it has launched in Europe, Canada &amp; Australia with eyes towards Asia and Latin America. Its processes enable its platform to launch more than ten products a year.</p>
      <blockquote>“Education is behind the times. 600 [million] school-aged children are not learning a minimum in Math [and]  Reading. Children are now spending twice as much time playing video games as they do outside. Unlocking the secret of loving to learn is key to our goal of becoming the biggest mobile gaming &amp; publishing company in education.”</blockquote>
      <p>Funds from the Crowdcube round will be used to help Mrs Wordsmith accelerate the Epic Word Adventure into new territories as well as further develop exciting content for children to learn and love language. The campaign is set to close at the end of December.</p>
