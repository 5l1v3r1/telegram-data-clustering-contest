      <p>While bushfires continue to burn across the state, a severe thunderstorm warning has been issued for some firegrounds - increasing the risk of fire activity.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, 64 fires were still burning in NSW with 39 of those yet to be contained.</p>

      <p>"Minimal backburning has been undertaken due to the fuel moisture from rain on firegrounds overnight," the Rural Fire Service (RFS) said.</p>
      <p>One blaze at Myall Creek Road, in the Richmond Valley, in northern NSW was bumped up to a 'watch and act' alert about 11.40am as fire activity increased.</p>
      <p>The fire merged with another near Banyabba Trail and Sportsmans Creek Firetrail and has burnt about 40,500 hectares.</p>

      <p>"Firefighters will be backburning from the highway where local conditions allow," the fire update said. "You will see an increase in smoke and flames as these operations are carried out."</p>
      <p>Other major fires include the one at Carrai Creek in Armidale, which has burnt out more than 221,800 hectares and is being controlled<b>,</b> and Gospers Mountain in Lithgow, which is also being controlled.</p>
      <p>"Protect yourself from the heat of the fire. Wear protective clothing and footwear. Cover all exposed skin, the RFS said. "If the fire impacts, seek shelter in a solid structure to protect yourself from the heat of the fire."</p>
      <p>There have been isolated thunderstorms and rainfall across many areas of the state, including Greater Sydney, the Central Coast and parts of the mid-north coast, but Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Abrar Shabren said it hasn't been enough to cause significant relief.</p>
      <p>The bureau has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Saturday night, warning of heavy rainfall and large hailstones for areas of the Mid-North Coast, Hunter, North West Slopes and Plains and Northern Tablelands.</p>

      <p>Mr Shabren said isolated thunderstorms will continue into Sunday and Monday, possibly increasing the risk of lightning strikes and fire activity - particularly in dry areas.</p>
      <p>A cold front will move across the state on Tuesday, bringing a change in wind conditions and a drop in temperatures.</p>
      <p>But the front will move on "fairly quickly" and could increase the risk of fire danger depending on "how dry it gets again when the front passes by", Mr Shabren said.</p>

      <p>Thick bushfire smoke has blanketed parts of the state in recent days but air quality improved to "fair" in Sydney on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The air is still considered "hazardous" in the Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour, North West Slopes and Central Tablelands regions, and "very poor" in the Upper Hunter - Muswellbrook area.</p>
