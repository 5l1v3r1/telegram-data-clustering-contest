      <p>School President Andrew T. Hsu said in a Thanksgiving holiday message to the campus community today advising those with active symptoms of mumps or those awaiting the results of a test for mumps to delay any travel plans on common carriers such as airlines and trains and to continue to self-isolate for five days from the onset of symptoms pending confirmation of the diagnosis.</p>
      <p>If it is not possible to change plans for commercial travel, and you are experiencing symptoms of mumps, you are advised to wear a mask to prevent the potential spread of mumps from respiratory droplets. Symptoms of mumps include tender swollen glands below the ear and along the jawline on one or both sides of the face and neck, headache, fever, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of appetite, testicular swelling and pelvic pain.</p>
