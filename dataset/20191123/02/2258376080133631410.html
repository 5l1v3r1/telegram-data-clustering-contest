      <p>SASKATOON -- After three suicides in less than a month, including two children who died, educators at Makwa Sahgaiehcan First Nation's school are feeling overwhelmed.</p>
      <p>"The teachers, they're all having mental breakdowns, mentally exhausted and emotionally drained," Cheyenne Fineblanket, a teacher at the community's school said Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Leaders in the community, located in northwest Saskatchewan, declared a state of crisis Thursday night after a 10-year-old girl died by suicide.</p>
      <p>“We’re in a place where we’re physically and emotionally unable to deal with this properly,” band manager Barry Chalifoux said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month a 14-year-old died by suicide and a recent suicide claimed the life of a father in his 40s.</p>
      <p>The community is requesting emergency mental health support, and more specifically, for children in school to be assessed with parental permission.</p>
      <p>"My first initial reaction was 'not another one,'" Tara Olsen, the school's vice principal, said.</p>
      <p>"Is this going to keep happening, we have to work together as a community to fix these mental health issues these kids are going through."</p>
      <p>On Friday, the Saskatchewan government said the province's health authority was prepared to offer staff trained in suicide risk assessment to help in the community.</p>
      <p>Indigenous Services Canada also pledged mental health and crisis support for the First Nation.</p>
