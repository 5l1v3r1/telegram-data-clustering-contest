      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:41:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:41</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Gilpin, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andrew-gilpin/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew's answers during his car crash BBC Newsnight interview have left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> 'troubled', according to reports.</p>
      <p>Pressure had been mounting on the duke in the wake of his BBC Newsnight interview about his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>This has led to a growing number of businesses, universities and charities distancing themselves from him.</p>
      <p>During the interview Prince Andrew was asked if he had sex with then-teenager Virgina Roberts, or other women trafficked by Epstein.</p>
      <p>And it appears that women's rights campaigner the Duchess of Sussex was left reeling at Prince Andrew's explanation.</p>

      <p>The duke replied: "No and without putting too fine a point on it, if you're a man it is a positive act to have sex with somebody.</p>
      <p>"You have to take some sort of positive action and so therefore if you try to forget it's very difficult to try and forget a positive action and I do not remember anything."</p>
      <p>According to the Telegraph his reply left her 'troubled' with source close to Meghan telling <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/22/exclusive-duchess-sussex-left-aghast-prince-andrews-description/">The Daily Telegraph:</a> "The interview left everyone watching it wanting to curl under a table.</p>

      <p>"It just got worse and worse and worse."</p>
      <p>Andrew will be scaling down his public work from now on, but it is not clear if his finances will change as he is supported by his mother the Queen and her help will never be disclosed.</p>
      <p>After the BBC interview, Andrew faced criticism for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the financier, who took his own life while in prison earlier this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p>

      <p>The duke has denied claims he slept with Ms Giuffre, on three separate occasions, twice while she was underage.</p>
      <p>It comes as the Princes Andrew’s treasured daughters have told how they will “keep calm and carry on” amid the scandal engulfing their father and the royal family.</p>
      <p>After a disastrous week for the Duke of York following his devastating BBC interview, princesses Beatrice and Eugenie have remained resolute and vowed to support their father after he was sacked by the Queen and Prince Charles.</p>

      <p>However, insiders believe Andrew’s banishment from public life could have a direct effect on their royal careers.</p>
      <p>The sisters are not “working royals” and have day jobs alongside their charity patronages and various campaigning roles.</p>
      <p>Beatrice, 31, is vice president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, an American software company where she focuses on ‘client development, while Eugenie, 29, has a role at the Hauser &amp; Wirth Art Gallery in Mayfair.</p>
      <p>Andrew has always campaigned for his “blood Princesses” to have a greater role within the royal family but dramatic downfall will undoubtedly mean he has little if any say in their royal roles in future, sources suggest.</p>

      <p>The girls, to their credit, are understood to be entirely focuses on supporting their father, alongside their mother the Duchess of York as Andrew picks up the pieces of his fateful decision to be interviewed by the BBC over his relationship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>A friend of the York sisters said: “They have both been extremely resolute and told Andrew they will support him in any way they can.</p>
      <p>“They have their passions and causes they successfully manage but are two ambitious women who can stand on their own.</p>
      <p>“It’s been very much a case of keep calm and carry on for them both.</p>
      <p>“They are close to cousins William and Harry and are adored by the Queen, who all will continue to advise them on their futures.”</p>

      <p>It is thought Beatrice’s wedding in 2020 to property millionaire Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi could be affected and scaled down from any plans already in place.</p>
      <p>Sources suggest Beatrice will be encouraged to have a “less public” wedding than her sister who married last October in St George’s chapel in Windsor castle complete with a carriage ride through the town centre.</p>
