      <p>Melody Thornton has said she needed therapy after the Pussycat Dolls split back in 2010.</p>
      <p>The Dancing On Ice star had been in the noughties girlband alongside Ashley Roberts and Nicole Scherzinger, with the girls starting out all the way back in 2003.</p>
      <p>They released two albums before splitting seven years later and opening up about her time in the band in a new interview, Melody has said she struggled with being thrown into the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Australian morning talk show, Today Extra, Melody claimed she ‘lost herself’ while in the girlband and sought out therapy when the Pussycat Dolls finally split.</p>
      <p>She explained that being catapulted to fame took its toll on her, saying: ‘[It was] the industry in general. I wouldn’t blame it on any one thing. I was thrust into the spotlight.</p>

      <p>‘I was introduced via this really huge vehicle, the Pussycat Dolls. No one knew it was going to be as successful as it was.’</p>

      <p>Melody continued: ‘Just no anonymity. You kind of lose track of yourself a little bit. Yeah, I spent time with a therapist and it’s been really good.’</p>
      <p>Despite finding it difficult being in the band first time around, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/05/melody-thornton-expresses-interest-in-pussycat-dolls-reunion-10122342/">Melody seems to be eyeing up a Pussycat Dolls reunion.</a></p>
      <p>She put the feelers out there in an interview with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/auhome/index.html">Daily Mail Australia</a> back in July and said: ‘I don’t think a Pussycat Dolls reunion is impossible to fathom.</p>
      <p>‘I love and respect my bandmates, so when the stars align.’</p>
      <p>Although, she was quick to point out just how tough being in the band had been on her.</p>
      <p>‘In the Dolls, we kept going, no matter how hard it was. I suffered hearing loss through severe sinus infection and I lost my sense of smell, which affected my sense of taste.</p>
      <p>‘I was glad I was young enough that it came back. I had syringes up my nose to get steroid shots into my system – we were being worked that hard it was crazy and really intense.’</p>
