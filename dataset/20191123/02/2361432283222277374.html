      <h1>'One Day at a Time' Co-Creator Gloria Calderón Kellett Signs Overall Deal With Amazon</h1>
      <h2>She will create and develop TV series and films for Amazon Prime Video through her GloNation banner</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:13:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/jennifer-maas/" target="_blank">Jennifer Maas</a></address>
      <p>“One Day at a Time” co-creator, executive producer and co-showrunner Gloria Calderón Kellett has signed a mega overall deal with Amazon Studios.</p>
      <p>Under the pact, Calderón Kellett will create and develop TV series and films for the studio through her GloNation banner. GloNation projects produced under the pact will premiere exclusively on Amazon Prime Video in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.</p>
      <p>An individual with knowledge tells TheWrap Calderón Kellett’s deal with Amazon is in the eight-figure range and will begin in June 2020, when her current overall with Sony Pictures Television comes to an end. She is also remaining in her “full role and capacity” as co-showrunner and executive producer on Season 4 of Pop TV’s “One Day at a Time,” which is currently in production.</p>

      <p>“I have been so blown away by the original series coming out of Amazon,” Calderón Kellett said. “Their commitment to supporting creators, specifically women, has been next level. It’s clear they are committed to supporting outstanding, quality television. When I met the diverse Amazon Studios team of creative executives, I immediately felt a kinship and connection. I could see immediately that our values and ideals in creating quality programming for underrepresented voices was a shared passion. I am overjoyed to take my next creative steps with them.”</p>
      <p>“Gloria is an incredible storyteller, who has written and created series that are not only culturally relevant, but engaging, relatable, and hilarious,” Vernon Sanders, co-head of television for Amazon Studios, said. “We are all delighted that Gloria will join the Amazon Studios family and excited to see the new projects she’ll bring to our Prime Video customers around the world.”</p>

      <p>Here’s Calderón Kellett’s bio, courtesy of Amazon:</p>
      <blockquote>The proud daughter of Cuban immigrants, Calderón Kellett has become a preeminent voice in Latinx storytelling. As co-creator, co-showrunner, executive producer, director and actress on the critically-acclaimed reimagining of the classic sitcom One Day At A Time, she has brought viewers a rarely seen side of the Latinx experience through the series’ poignant portrayal of a Cuban Family at a time where the political misrepresentation of the Latinx community has become increasingly prevalent. Since its debut, the show has earned praise from critics and audiences alike for offering heart and humor, while still bravely tackling such timely topics as racism, sexism, LGBTQ issues and deportation, as well as mental health &amp; addiction issues like PTSD, anxiety and alcoholism.<br/>Calderón Kellett’s early television credits include the hit sitcom How I Met Your Mother,where she served as co-producer and wrote several episodes. Her acting credits include Jane The Virgin, Angie Tribeca, Dead To Me, How I Met Your Mother, Trophy Wife, and One Day At A Time; while her directing credits include One Day At A Time, Merry Happy Whatever, Mr. Iglesias and the new reboot of Mad About You. She is currently running the fourth season of One Day At A Time.<br/>Additionally, Calderón Kellett has received multiple awards, including The Television Academy Honors, Mental Health America Media Award, ALMA Award, Imagen Award, Vanguard Award, NHMC Award, Sentinel Award, and The Voice Award. She is also one of the few creatives to have the distinction of creating a show with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.</blockquote>
      <p>She is repped by Odenkirk Provissiero Ent, Felker Toczek, and UTA.</p>
