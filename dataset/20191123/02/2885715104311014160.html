      <p>In yet another incident, an unidentified person robbed $7,000 from an employee of a private company dealing in exchange of foreign currency, at a residential building in Kalyani Nagar on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>The victim — identified as Sanket Gavade (31), a resident of Kasarwadi — has lodged an FIR in this case at Yerawada police station. Police said Gavade worked as a customer care executive for the private company dealing in exchange of foreign currency.</p>
      <p>Police said that after receiving calls from customers, the company provides home delivery of foreign currency to them and accepts Indian currency against it in cash or online.</p>
      <p>According to police, the unidentified accused had called the company and demanded $7,000. He asked for the currency to be delivered at West View apartment in Kalyani Nagar.</p>
      <p>When Gavade reached the spot around 6.15 pm, the accused snatched the foreign currency (estimated at Rs 5,08,200) from his possession, pushed him inside the apartment and fled from the spot after locking the door from outside.</p>
      <p>Assistant Police Inspector Balbhim Nanavare, the investigating officer in the case, said, “The accused had taken the service apartment on rent in Kalyani Nagar for a day. He fled from the spot after committing the crime. There was no CCTV camera in the building. After the accused escaped, the complainant called his company authorities, who helped him come out of the locked apartment. Investigation is on to identify and arrest the accused.”</p>
      <p>In a similar incident, on November 8, two unidentified persons had allegedly robbed $5,000 from Vaibhav Krushna Patole (29) after spraying sedatives on him at an apartment in <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/what-is/what-was-the-battle-of-koregaon-mahar-dalit-marathas-maharashtra-bandh-5009488/">Koregaon</a> Park area. Patole too was working for a company dealing in exchange of foreign currency. Police are probing whether that offence has any link with the one that happened in Kalyani Nagar.</p>
