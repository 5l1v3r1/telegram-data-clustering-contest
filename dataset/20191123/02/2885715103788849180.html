      <p>The police Friday arrested six youths for allegedly gangraping two cousin sisters, aged 16 and 17, while they were returning home from a market at a village in Bareilly.</p>
      <p>The incident took place on November 17, but the family informed the police about the incident on Thursday after which a case was lodged.</p>
      <p>The police said that the family came to know about the incident after the accused circulated video clips of the sexual assault on social media. The accused released the videos after the girls refused to meet them, police added.</p>
      <p>The accused will be produced before a local court on Saturday, said Additional Superintendent of Police (Rural) Sansar Singh. Except one, the rest were named in the FIR. The role of the sixth accused came to light during preliminary investigation, said Singh.</p>
      <p>The men have been booked on charges of gangrape and criminal intimidation. Police also invoked the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and Information Technology Act. One of the accused is neighbour of the victims, while others belong to a neighbouring village.</p>
      <p>Medical examination of the victims was conducted on Friday and the reports are awaited.</p>
      <p>The SHO of the police station concerned said the father of one of the victims had alleged that on November 17, the girls went to a neighbouring village to buy medicine. While the girls were returning home, the accused caught them and dragged them to a nearby sugarcane field at gunpoint, the father said. They allegedly gangraped the girls and recorded the incident on their cellphone, said police. Later, they allowed them to go home.</p>
      <p>Police informed said on Wednesday, one of the accused contacted the one of the girl and asked her to come to a place along with her sister. He threatened to circulate video clips if she refused to come.</p>
      <p>The girls, however, did not go and the accused circulated the video, the police said.</p>
      <p>When the video clips reached a member of the girls’ family, he verified it with them.</p>
      <p>“The girl told us about the incident and also also how the accused were threatening them. The family along with the victims reached the police station and got a case lodged against five youths,” said anohter police officer.</p>
