      <p>Remotely piloted aircraft operations conducted by AFRICOM were interrupted in Tripoli, Libya, Thursday evening as the US military force found itself unable to maintain contact with its unarmed aircraft.</p>
      <blockquote>“RPA operations are conducted in Libya to assess the ongoing security situation and monitor violent extremist activity,” read an <a href="https://www.africom.mil/media-room/pressrelease/32380/rpa-lost-over-tripoli-incident-under-investigation">AFRICOM press release</a> published one day after the incident. “These operations are critical to counter terror activity in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911101077273510-malta-libya-agree-on-mutual-cooperation-to-intercept-migrants---reports/">Libya</a> and are fully coordinated with appropriate government officials.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Italian Air Force also experienced a snag in its reconnaissance missions earlier this week after an MQ-9 Reaper drone was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/africa/201911211077363471-photos-italian-air-force-reaper-drone-downed-over-libya/">downed in Libya on Wednesday</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2019/11/21/italy-confirms-military-drone-crashed-in-libya/">Defense News</a> detailed that while some initial reports claimed the drone belonged to Turkey, was operating on behalf of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj’s UN-recognized Government of National Accord and was shot down by the Libyan National Army, Italian military general staff later confirmed the drone belonged to them.</p>
      <blockquote>Furthermore, Italy claimed the aircraft was operating as part of Operation Mare Sicuro - an anti-human trafficking mission - when “contact was lost with the Italian Air Force drone, which subsequently crashed in <a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201910231077130964-libya-russia-to-sign-document-on-supply-of-russian-wheat---contact-group-head/">Libyan</a> territory” despite “following a flight plan previously communicated to Libyan authorities.”</blockquote>
      <p>Like AFRICOM, the Italian Air Force has launched an investigation into the matter.</p>
