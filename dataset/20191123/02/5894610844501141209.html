      <p>FINE Gael is staying silent on whether the party knew the business partner of its by-election candidate was a convicted tax dodger.</p>
      <p>Verona Murphy runs a haulage firm, Drumur Transport Ltd, with her business partner Joseph Druhan.</p>
      <p>The name of the firm is drawn from a combination of their surnames.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Mr Druhan was personally listed as a tax defaulter by the Revenue Commissioners for under-declaration of VAT.</p>

      <p>He paid €74,271 - €41,865 in tax and €32,406 in penalties.</p>
      <p>Mr Druhan made false VAT returns to the Revenue using bogus invoices for diesel which he took from the public counter of a Rosslare fuel suppliers.</p>
      <p>He was given a suspended sentence of one year in prison in February 2012.</p>
      <p>Mr Druhan, from Ballysheen, Carne, Broadway, in Co Wexford, pleaded guilty to eight counts of knowingly making incorrect VAT returns between January 2005 and October 2008; claiming a refund of €5,199 from Revenue on May 25, 2005, to which he was not entitled; producing an incorrect invoice in the name of Rosslare Fuels to Revenue officer Prionsias O Maolalaidh on March 6, 2008, and failing to keep true records of all VAT transactions for the period January 2005 to December 2005.</p>
      <p>The offences related to Mr Druhan's business as a sole trader.</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy and Mr Druhan later merged their businesses and set up as a limited company.</p>
      <p>Records in the Companies Registration Office say that the company was formed in 2009.</p>
      <p>When asked if it was aware of the case, a Fine Gael spokesperson said the party had no response.</p>
      <p>Fine Gael has been taken by surprise by a series of comments by, and revelations about, Ms Murphy who is standing in the Wexford by-election next week.</p>
      <p>The party was caught unawares by a series of interviews in which she expressed views about immigrants.</p>
      <p>And revelations of bullying allegations against Ms Murphy drew a mixed response.</p>
      <p>Initially, the party said that it had no comment, but later said it did know about the case.</p>
