      <h1>Danny DeVito Approves of Colin Farrell’s Penguin Casting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:32:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>It was reported earlier this month that <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/news/471115-report-colin-farrell-may-play-penguin-in-the-batman">Colin Farrell was Matt Reeves’ new choice</a> to play <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/the-batman"><b>The Batman</b></a>’s Penguin after negotiations with Jonah Hill fell through. Reeves still hasn’t confirmed his casting on Twitter like he has for some of the film’s other supporting players. Regardless, Farrell just got an endorsement from the last actor who brought the diminutive Batman rogue to life on the big screen.</p>
      <p>While promoting <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/jumanji-the-next-level"><b>Jumanji: The Next Level</b></a>, Danny DeVito shared his thoughts on Farrell taking over the role. Back in 1992, DeVito turned in an unabashedly creepy performance as Oswald Cobblepot in Tim Burton’s <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/batman-returns"><b>Batman Returns</b></a>. Obviously, plenty of other actors have played the villain in various films and TV shows over the years. But during an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-batman-penguin-exclusive-danny-devito-colin-farrell-thoughts/">ScreenRant</a>, DeVito expressed his belief that Farrell is up to the task.</p>
      <h3>RELATED: <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/472288-matt-reeves-casts-john-turturro-as-carmine-falcone-in-the-batman">Matt Reeves Casts John Turturro As Carmine Falcone in The Batman</a></h3>
      <p>“Colin’s a great actor,” said DeVito. “He’s a good friend of mine. I’ve known him for many years and I think he’s going to do a great job as the Penguin. It’s going to be really interesting to see his take on it.”</p>
      <p>DeVito’s performance as the Penguin definitely stands apart from other versions of the character. The filmmakers behind <b>Batman Returns</b> re-imagined him in a way that took his “Penguin” moniker very literally. Specifically, they gave him a number of birth defects, including pale skin and flippers for hands. The sequel’s makeup team, which included the legendary Stan Winston, earned an Oscar nomination for their efforts.</p>
