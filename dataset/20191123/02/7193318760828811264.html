      <p>STILLWATER — Oklahoma State center Yor Anei grabbed the rebound, dribbled to the center of the lane and spun as he dropped the basketball into the goal with his left hand.</p>
      <p>He nearly sprinted to halfcourt in celebration as Cowboys faithful went wild.</p>
      <p>OSU’s big man delivered late to alleviate any worries on a slog of a night for the Cowboys with four straight points — an alley-oop dunk and then a putback — in the final 2:03.</p>
      <p>It was enough to help the Cowboys (5-0) remain perfect to start the season with a 70-63 victory over Western Michigan on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The win also left a better feeling the same day OSU received a Notice of Allegations from the NCAA.</p>
      <p>The NCAA informed OSU it faced a Level 1 allegation from an investigation into former associate coach Lamont Evans, who was found by an FBI probe to have accepted bribes to link top players with bribe-paying managers and financial advisers from April 2016 through September 2017.</p>
      <p>OSU plans to appeal and has 90 days to respond.</p>
      <p>But that wasn’t going to overshadow OSU’s best start since going 7-0 to open the 2014-15 season.</p>
      <p>Anei recorded his third career double double with 13 points and 12 rebounds. He also had five blocks.</p>
      <p>Point guard Isaac Likekele also scored 10 points to go along with four assists and three rebounds.</p>
