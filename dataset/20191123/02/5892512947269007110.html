      <h1>UFC set for London return this March from inside O2 Arena</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Hiergesell</a></address>
      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) will make its return to England on March 21 from inside O2 Arena in London, per a recent press release by the promotion.</p>
      <p>This will be the first time UFC is hosting an event at O2 Arena since UFC Fight Night 147 this past March, in which Jorge Masvidal stunned Darren Till via second-round knockout to set “Gamebred” up for one of the most successful 2019 campaigns in all of MMA.</p>
      <p>“The UK and Ireland is established as one of our flagship markets in Europe,” said UFC Senior Vice President David Shaw, according to the press release.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted to be returning to London, our fans are fantastic and have always shown up in their thousands to support their local heroes.”</p>
      <p>While no fights have been officially scheduled for the upcoming March event, it’s highly likely that UFC showcases some of the most recognizable English names on the roster. Whether it’s the aforementioned Till, who defeated Kelvin Gastelum in his middleweight debut earlier this month, Leon Edwards, who has won his last eight fights at 170 pounds, or rising bantamweight contender Nathaniel Wood, who has won his first three UFC appearances by way of submission, the promotion is not short on marquee attractions.</p>
      <p>And who knows, maybe UFC will book a Robert Whittaker vs. Till showdown to lead the pack. Either way, U.K. fight fans can now start clearing out their March schedules.</p>
