      <p>The Piauí Health Department said there were already more than 7,000 cases registered, <a href="https://www.diariopiaui.com/secretaria-de-saude-informa-que-casos-de-dengue-cresceram-mais-de-300-no-piaui-em-2019/">according to a Diario Piaui report (computer translated).</a></p>
      <p>“We have to note an interesting aspect that is the normality that we have seen over the years in the number of reported cases in the state. It ranges from 7 to 8,000 cases, usually in the years that we consider relatively quiet. In 2018 there were less than 2,000 cases of dengue and this year we already have more than 7,000, so this figure is significant compared to 2018, which was an atypical year in the positive sense, ”he said.</p>
