      <p>The Indian selection committee has decided to release Rishabh Pant to get some match time in domestic cricket ahead of the limited-overs series against the West Indies next month.</p>
      <p>Andhra keeper-batsman Kona Shrikar Bharat will join the Indian team as Wriddhiman Saha’s cover for the remaining couple of days during the second and final Test against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>“Rishabh will be playing all the six matches (3 T20s and 3 ODIs) against the West Indies. The selectors thought it’s only prudent that he goes and plays in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy for Delhi,” a senior BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.</p>
      <p>Bharat, who has been a regular feature for India A in red-ball matches finally got some consolation for his consistent performances during last two seasons.</p>
      <p>He has scored 3,909 runs in 69 first-class games with eight hundreds and 20 half-centuries which includes a triple hundred.</p>
      <p>“I played the first pink-ball match in Lucknow when it was introduced in the Duleep Trophy in 2015,” Bharat told PTI as he was on his way to airport from his Visakhapatnam residence.</p>
      <p>He said that he was called and asked to join the team by 8.30 am tomorrow morning.</p>
      <p>“I got a call and asked to join the team I’m reaching at 8.30 tomorrow morning. I am looking forward to share the dressing room with my idol Virat Bhai,” said Bharat, who will at the maximum get a couple of days with the match poised to end inside three days.</p>
      <p>The ICC rule that came into effect in 2017 where a substitute keeper can take place of the first team glovesman if he happens to sustain an on-field injury.</p>
      <p>However, Wriddhiman Saha is doing perfectly fine at the moment and Bharat’s inclusion is merely a precautionary measure.</p>
      <p>“Wriddhiman is one of the best wicketkeepers of the current era. I’m hoping to learnt a lot from them. Too excited,” he added.</p>
