      <p>The visitors have only won once in the league so far this season but looked on course for a remarkable victory at Signal Iduna Park as they went in at half-time with a commanding lead â€“ only to leave with a 3-3 draw.</p>
      <p>Streli Mamba finished off a swift Paderborn counter to put them ahead with five minutes on the clock before the forward doubled his tally for the evening as he latched onto <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-zolinski/"><b>Ben Zolinski</b></a>'s ball over the top and finished well.</p>

      <p>The game looked over before the interval as Gerrit Holtmann burst through down the left and tucked away his chance after 43 minutes.</p>
      <p>Dortmund rallied after the interval and England international <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jadon-sancho/"><b>Jadon Sancho</b></a> started the comeback with a well-taken strike moments after the restart.</p>
      <p>Reus saw a fine effort saved by Leo Zingerle soon after as the tide of the match turned in favour of the hosts.</p>
      <p>They had to wait for the 84th minute for the second goal to come, however, this time Axel Witsel got his head to a hopeful Mats Hummels ball into the box to set up a tense finale.</p>

      <p>Paderborn could not hold on, Sancho spurning a decent chance before crossing perfectly for Reus to head in a dramatic equaliser to take Lucien Favre's side to within a point of second place before the rest of the weekend's games.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile in Ligue 1, reigning champions and runaway leaders Paris St Germain eased to a 12th win of the season at home to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/lille/"><b>Lille</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Mauro Icardi tapped in Idrissa Gana Gueye's cross to open the scoring with the 2-0 victory secured before the interval courtesy of a cool finish by Angel Di Maria.</p>
      <p>PSG spurned chances to further increase their lead but were rarely troubled as they racked up yet another three points.</p>

      <p>After a goalless first-half, Levante took the lead through Roger Marti, only for the visitors to hit back after 65 minutes as Daniel Rodriguez Vazquez struck.</p>
      <p>Ruben Rochina would make sure of the points for the hosts, who survived a late red card for midfielder Jose Campana to seal the victory.</p>
