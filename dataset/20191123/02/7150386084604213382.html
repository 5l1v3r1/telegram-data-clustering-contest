      <p>Actor <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/kartik-aaryan/">Kartik Aaryan</a> turned 29 on November 22. He hosted a big birthday bash for his industry friends and several prominent names from Bollywood were seen attending the party. Apart from his parents who were clicked by the paparazzi outside a popular hotel in Mumbai, his leading ladies from upcoming films were also papped. Kartik was seen posing with <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/kiara-advani/">Kiara Advani</a> with whom he’s working in <i>Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2</i>. He was seen escorting<a href="https://www.india.com/topic/janhvi-kapoor/"> Janhvi Kapoor</a> to her car. They are working together in<i> Dostana 2</i>. Both <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/bhumi-pednekar/">Bhumi Pednekar</a> and <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/ananya-panday/">Ananya Panday</a> were also seen making stunning appearances at the party. They will be seen with Kartik in <i>Pati Patni Aur Woh</i>. Also clicked outside the party venue was <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/kriti-sanon/">Kriti Sanon</a> who has worked with the birthday boy in <i>Luka Chuppi</i> that was released earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Kartik’s birthday appeared no less than a full filmy Bollywood award night with young stars all dolled up to celebrate the special day of one of the most loved male actors in the country. Even though there were many pretty faces in attendance at the party, the absence of <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/sara-ali-khan/">Sara Ali Khan</a> was quite prominent. The actor will be seen with Kartik in Imtiaz Ali’s romantic drama slated for release on February 14.</p>
      <p>For the party, Ananya cut a striking picture in her black ruffle and sheer strapless dress by designer Flor Et.Al. Her makeup and hairstyling added wonders to her look.</p>
