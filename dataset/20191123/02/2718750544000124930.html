      <h1>Everybody Wants Some of the New <i>Batman</i>, Including John Turturro, Who Is Now Carmine Falcone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T02:19:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 02:19</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Crucchiola</a></address>
      <p><i>The Batman </i>has another villain to worry about. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/batman-casts-john-turturro-as-crime-boss-carmine-falcone-1257437"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, John Turturro has joined the cast of Matt Reeves’s upcoming installment of the Dark Knight saga as crime boss Carmine Falcone. He’s definitely a Gotham Big Bad, and he joins a cast that already includes heavy DC hitters like The Riddler (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/the-batman-cast-paul-dano-the-riddler.html">Paul Dano</a>), Catwoman (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/zoe-kravitz-to-star-as-catwoman-in-upcoming-batman.html">Zoë Kravitz</a>), Commissioner Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), and maybe soon The Penguin, if <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/colin-farrell-penguin-batman.html">talks with Colin Ferrell</a> go well and he signs a contract. There’s also <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/robert-pattinson-on-batman-anxiety-the-lighthouse.html">Robert Pattinson</a> playing Bruce Wayne himself. The last time we saw Falcone on the big screen it was in Christopher Nolan’s <i>Batman Begins</i>, when he was played by Tom Wilkinson. Turturro seems like the type to bring a little more chaotic energy to the role. Gotham is getting crowded!</p>
