      <p>Indian boxing star <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/Vijender-Singh">Vijender Singh</a> demolished Ghana’s former Commonwealth champion Charles Adamu to claim his 12th successive win and ensure that his four-year unbeaten streak in the professional circuit remained intact, here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old former Olympic bronze-medallist prevailed unanimously in an eight-round super middleweight contest against the 42-year-old.</p>
      <p>Here are highlights from Vijender’s bout:</p>

      <p>The Indian’s right hand was just too precise and powerful to handle for Adamu, who looked intimidated and was thrown off-balance more than once.</p>
      <p>The Ghanian also copped a point deduction in the fourth round for excessive bending. To Adamu’s credit, he fought through despite the onslaught and ensured that the bout went the full distance.</p>
      <p>Adamu came into the contest with an experience of 47 bouts, of which he had won 33 (26 knockouts).</p>
      <p>The Ghanian is also an Olympian and won a bronze medal for his country in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur during his amateur days.</p>
      <p>“I don’t expect him to put up too much of a challenge because I have noticed he is slower than me. So, despite his experience, I think I will have the edge,” Vijender told PTI from Dubai on the eve of the 10-round clash.</p>
      <p>“So I am relaxed, nothing to worry there,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I will probably be fighting in India next and people can expect that to be a big one. Obviously I can’t give out the full details for now,” he said.</p>
