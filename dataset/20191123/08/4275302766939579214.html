      <h2>Hundreds of students at Abertay University were recognised for their hard work at glittering graduation ceremony at the Caird Hall.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/rebeccamccurdy/" target="_blank">Rebecca McCurdy</a></address>
      <p>Students who completed undergraduate and postgraduate qualifications in courses such as forensic science, accounting and computer arts donned gowns to collect their diplomas.</p>
      <p>Cameron Moody, who achieved a BA (Hons) in Game Design and Production, was one of the students to receive a degree certificate.</p>
      <p>The university’s industry connections have helped Cameron to enhance his creative potential.</p>
      <p>He said: “Like most people on this course, I’ve loved games for longer than I can remember and I’ve been creatively inclined for years.</p>
      <p>“I chose Abertay in particular because of its reputation, industry connections, and the way the course was set up – I liked the modules and the variety they covered.”</p>
      <p>Stephanie Crowe’s efforts in achieving a MSc Psychology were celebrated at the bash.</p>
      <p>She is working to achieve her goal of developing her own User Experience business.</p>
      <p>Her goal could be realised, thanks to the opportunity to work with the university’s Bell Street Ventures enterprise centre.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m very happy an excited for the next steps in my life.</p>
      <p>“It’ll be a great day, and a lot of people in my family are coming along to celebrate.</p>
      <p>“I’m the first person in my family to get a Masters, so I’ll get a second photo on my gran’s wall.”</p>
      <p>The graduation ceremony also welcomed the university’s first ever female Chancellor, Professor Alice Brown.</p>
      <p>In her first address to grandaunts, she said taking over from Lord Cullen as Chancellor left her feeling “honoured and humbled.”</p>
      <p>The ceremony draws Abertay’s anniversary celebrations to a close – as university status was first awarded to the institution in 1994.</p>
