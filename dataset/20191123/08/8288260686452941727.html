      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:58:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">Brett Gibbons, Jess Glass, PA, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/brett-gibbons/</a></address>
      <p>GPs have voted to axe home visits after arguing the family doctors no longer have the capacity to offer them.</p>
      <p>The majority of delegates at the Local Medical Committee (LMC) England Conference supported a proposal to remove house calls from the doctors' key contract.</p>
      <p>Kent Local Medical Committee, an independent body which works with the British Medical Association (BMA) to help shape policy, called for the change to the GP contract.</p>
      <p>The body argued that "GPs no longer have the capacity to offer home visits" and said the BMA's General Practitioners Committee (GPC) should renegotiate with the NHS to "remove the anachronism of home visits from core contract work, negotiate a separate acute service for urgent visits, and demand any change in service is widely advertised to patients".</p>

      <p>After the motion was passed, Kent LMC said it is not attempting to remove home visits entirely, but instead change policy to ensure suitable provision.</p>
      <p>The conference also passed a separate motion for the GPC to negotiate an acute service for urgent home visits.</p>
      <p>A Kent LMC statement said: "This motion is not intended to remove the ability of GPs to perform home visits. More complex, vulnerable and palliative patients are best served by their GP visiting them when needed.</p>
      <p>"Currently there is no universal consistency for patients. Increasing demand and falling GP numbers are further compounding pressures in general practice."</p>
      <p>The body said that 26,400,000 general practice appointments took place in September, a rise of 9.7 per cent from the previous year.</p>
      <p>"The NHS is in a cycle of transformation. Kent LMC are asking for a home-visiting service that is properly resourced and delivered to our patients," the statement added.</p>
      <p>Nikita Kanani, the NHS's national medical director for primary care and a London GP, said when a patient clinically required a GP home visit they would receive one.</p>
      <p>"As set out in the NHS Long Term Plan, other healthcare professionals such as nurses and advanced paramedics, will also make home visits if a patient needs one.</p>
      <p>"We recognise the pressures that general practice faces, which is why we are investing an extra Â£4.5bn on local doctors and community services which will help fund 20,000 more staff to support GP practices and offer high quality care for patient."</p>
      <p>The passing of the three-part motion at the conference will now instruct GPC England, the part of the BMA which represents English GPs, to negotiate the policy with NHS England in contract settlements.</p>
