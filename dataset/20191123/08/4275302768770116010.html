      <h2>A Dundee woman is campaigning to set up a “dream” encounter with Sir Rod Stewart – and have the superstar create her next tattoo.</h2>

      <p>Superfan Amy Campbell is hoping to meet the singer around <a href="https://www.pandjlive.com/events/rod-stewart/">his P&amp;J Live gig in Aberdeen this December</a> so she can have him autograph her arm – before getting it permanently inked on to her body.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two is Sir Rod Stewart daft and even named her lurcher dog Rod after the man himself.</p>
      <p>And the veterinary nurse said it would be only her second tattoo; with the other being a wedding ring artwork.</p>

      <p>Mrs Campbell said: “It has always been a dream to meet him. I just kind of came up with the idea to get an autograph, something I can keep forever.</p>
      <p>“Another lady who did the same thing said it took her quite a long time but I have got nothing to lose.</p>
      <p>“This is just a random idea. I’ve been tweeting him every day with a line from one of his songs and I’m trying to get everyone to re-tweet.</p>

      <p>Mrs Campbell has been obsessed with Sir Rod’s music since the age of 10 and said the December gig in Aberdeen will be the sixth time she’s seen him live.</p>
      <p>She added: “It would just be the dream, just five minutes of his time for a picture and an autograph. That would be amazing.</p>

      <p>“My family all think I’m mad. The kids get forced to listen to him in the house. They do really like his music and my husband quite likes him as well.”</p>

The star is not believed to have played in the City of Discovery <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/dundee/476541/pictures-rodmania-heres-happened-sir-rod-stewart-visited-dundee-1974/">since the 1970s</a>.</p>
      <p>However the gig never came to fruition with Sir Rod then going on to announce two 2019 gigs in Aberdeen.</p>
