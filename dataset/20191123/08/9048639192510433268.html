      <p>"Really that the research is overwhelming, and that it is creating an adverse learning environment,” said Joe Lubig who is on a committee looking into the nickname.</p>
      <p>Lubig said the community is justified in asking about the nicknames.</p>
      <p>"Are they in conflict with what we do, who we are and what we need to do to create a positive learning environment?” he said.</p>
      <p>In October, Lubig says the school board and Superintendent Bill Saunders asked the MSHS Nickname Research Committee to review the school's nickname.</p>
      <p>At the time, several community members questioned whether or not those name are culturally insensitive or if they are a sense of pride for all students in the community.</p>
      <p>"What the research is saying, in this instance, is that it's creating an adverse learning environment for every student because there's that tension and that conflict,” said Lubig.</p>
      <p>Several years ago, the school was able to change its logo from a Native American headdress to the letter "M."</p>
      <p>Some said this isn’t enough, and the nicknames need to change as well.</p>
      <p>Lubig says the committee is trying to learn why the nickname is creating this environment and what the rationale would be.</p>
      <p>This is why the committee is asking anyone with evidence to share.</p>
      <p>"The more emotional pleas - we really encourage members of the public to go to a board meeting to express those concerns,” Lubig said.</p>
      <p>The committee has until December 16 to make a recommendation for the use of those nicknames.</p>
