      <h1>Ajit's decision an act of indiscipline, no NCP worker supports it: Pawar</h1>
      <h2>Pawar was addressing a joint press conference with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:33:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:33</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>president <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>on Saturday said the decision of his nephew Ajit Pawar to join hands with the BJP to form a government in Maharashtra was an act of indiscipline and attracts provisions of anti-defection law.</p>
      <p>Pawar was addressing a joint press conference with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>chief Uddhav Thackeray in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's decision is an act of indiscipline. No <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>worker is in favour of the NCP-BJP government. <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>MLAs who support the BJP should know this move attracts provisions of anti-defection law," he said.</p>
      <p>Whenever elections are held in the constituencies of these legislators, Congress-NCP and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>would unitedly defeat them, he added.</p>
      <p>He said 54 newly-elected legislators of the NCP had signed a paper along with their names and constituencies for internal purpose and these signatures may have been misused as letter of support and submitted to the governor.</p>
      <p>"If this is true, the governor has also been misled," Pawar said, adding that the paper may have been taken by Ajit Pawar as the leader of the legislature party.</p>
      <p>He said those MLAs, who were taken to the Raj Bhavan for oath-taking without their knowledge, have contacted him and informed how they were misled.</p>
      <p>Three such legislators, including Rajendra Shingane from Buldhana and Sandeep Kshirsagar from Beed, were present at the press conference.</p>
      <p>They said they were called to party leader Dhananjay Munde's house at 7 am and from there were taken in a car to Raj Bhavan.</p>
      <p>Pawar said no action would be taken against those who unknowingly went to Raj bhavan for the swearing-in and were back in the party fold.</p>
      <p>NCP legislature party meeting would be held later in the day to elect the new leader.</p>
      <p>On the issue of action against Ajit Pawar, the former Union minister said a decision to that effect would be taken by the disciplinary committee.</p>
      <p>Uddhav Thackeray said, "Earlier the EVM khel (game) was going on and now this is new khel. From here onwards I don't think elections are even needed."</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows what Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did when betrayed and attacked from the back," he said, adding that Sena workers will foil all attempts to poach party MLAs.</p>
