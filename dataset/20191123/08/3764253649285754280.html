      </p>
      <p>While it is a popular practice for brides to go on their kneels when feeding their husbands at their traditional marriage ceremony, it appears the rules are changing as more men are becoming more opened to holding liberal views on the matter.</p>
      <p>Currently trending on social media is a video from a traditional wedding shared by a lady who recently got married to the love of her life. In the video, she attempted to kneel and feed her husband as is practiced, but he stopped her.</p>
      <p>Sharing the video, she wrote:<i>"This man knows! He knows my reservation about this kneeling down thing but my decision to do it because of culture. But he said No and insisted to everyone that I don't have to kneel to feed him. Ahn, I made the best choice!"</i></p>
