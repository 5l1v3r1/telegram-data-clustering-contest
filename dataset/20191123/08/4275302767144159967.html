      <h1>No plans for more Traveller sites in Angus or Dundee</h1>
      <h2>Council bosses in Angus and Dundee say they have no firm plans to increase Traveller provision in their areas.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:45:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/grahambrown/" target="_blank">Graham Brown</a></address>
      <p>It comes after a top Angus official said the authority would have to consider the way it handles enforcement in the wake of a planning appeal decision to allow a family to stay together near Kirriemuir on a site originally developed without permission.</p>
      <p>Illegal Traveller encampments have proved a controversial and costly issue for councils in recent years but Angus and Dundee only have one dedicated site apiece – St Christopher’s at Montrose and Balmuir Wood, near Tealing.</p>
      <p>Angus Council’s development management review committee unanimously overturned a previous decision over the land near Logie following the family plea.</p>
      <p>Planning boss Kate Cowey has now sounded a note of caution about the options for enforcement action in relation to a site at Kinnaber, near Montrose, which has been at the centre of controversy for around a decade and a half.</p>
      <p>“Investigations are ongoing in terms of ownership and the approach being taken will need to be examined in light of the DMRC decision in relation to Logie,” she said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this summer an Angus farmer said he had been forced to make his property like “Fort Knox” after Travellers moved onto his land from a Brechin public park.</p>
      <p>Montrose SNP councillor Bill Duff told an Angus communities committee: “I’m conscious the one site we have in Montrose is always full and it does seem to be an issue that we have unauthorised encampments but no capacity.”</p>
      <p>Housing service leader John Morrow said there were no plans to extend St Christopher’s, adding: “In terms of wider need, to some extent there’s a lack of information. By its very nature it’s a moveable need so what we are arguing for more is a national survey to see where Angus fits.</p>
      <p>“That may show there is an increased demand and if it does we would look at developing increased capacity in a co-ordinated way with our neighbouring authorities.”</p>
      <p>Dundee City Council confirmed it was continuing to operate the Tealing site but did not give any indication of proposals to expand provision.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “There is a long tradition of Gypsy/Travellers in Scotland and it is important the community feels safe and respected and know they are valued members of Scotland’s diverse cultural heritage.</p>
      <p>“A joint Scottish Government and COSLA £3 million action plan to tackle the discrimination and challenges faced by the Gypsy/Traveller community was published last month.</p>
      <p>“Under the plan, we are making £2 million of the funding available to local authorities to improve Gypsy/Traveller accommodation and sites.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to work with Gypsy/Traveller communities so we have a better understanding of their accommodation needs and preferences.”</p>
