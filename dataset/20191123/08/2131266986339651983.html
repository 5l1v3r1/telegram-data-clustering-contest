      <p>Supercars star Shane van Gisbergen has won race one at the Newcastle 500 from pole position, but a mistake from Triple Eight teammate Jamie Whincup has proved costly.</p>
      <p>The Holden duo were in prime position on Saturday for a one-two finish and to close the gap in the teams' championship race, but Whincup misjudged a corner with 20 laps to go and dropped from second to seventh.</p>
      <p>It allowed DJR Team Penske's Scott McLaughlin and Fabian Coulthard to round out the podium and extend their teams' championship lead ahead of Sunday's season- ending race.</p>

      <p>The 2019 Supercars champion McLaughlin now looks set to complete the double as DJR Team Penske hold a 143-point lead over Triple Eight.</p>
      <p>Van Gisbergen said it was an uncharacteristic error from Whincup but was thrilled to win after only just sneaking into the top 10 shootout earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>"Awesome day. Shame about Jamie making a mistake there, that would have been great team points," he said.</p>
      <p>"We had a cool start, a good battle, then forced our way through."</p>
      <p>There are still 288 points up for grabs on Sunday and McLaughlin warned the teams' title race wasn't won yet, heading into "the last day of school".</p>
      <p>"It's tough around here, it's quite hard work," he said.</p>
      <p>"Jamie made a mistake there which gifted us a double podium and I'm sure they'll come back stronger tomorrow.</p>
      <p>"But a great team result."</p>
      <p>Coulthard admitted he was lucky to secure third spot and said the focus was now firmly on winning the teams' championship.</p>
      <p>"We were gifted a little bit with Jamie going down the escape road, a pretty rare mistake for him but we'll take it," Coulthard said.</p>
      <p>"We want to win that teams pretty bad."</p>
      <p>Walkinshaw Andretti United's Scott Pye delivered a sensational performance after starting last (24th) on the grid to finish sixth thanks to clever pit stops.</p>
      <p>"I needed to right that wrong from qualifying," Pye said.</p>
      <p>"It was an awesome race and I felt good until the end. I gave it absolutely everything until the flag."</p>
