      <p>David Prutton believes that Leeds United will pick up three points on Saturday afternoon when they travel to Luton Town.</p>
      <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s team are back in action after the international break away to Luton and will be favourites to win.</p>
      <p>The Whites currently sit third in the Championship table and are unbeaten in their last five league matches.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Luton are 21st in the division standings just above the relegation spots and are in poor form.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports pundit Prutton has predicted a 2-0 scoreline in Leeds’ favour and can’t see them struggling on the road at the weekend against struggling opponents.</p>
      <p>“It was never going to be easy for Luton on their return to the Championship after such a long time away, but four defeats on the spin has left them in real jeopardy of dropping into the bottom three,” <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/34681/11865666/david-pruttons-sky-bet-efl-predictions">Prutton told Sky Sports.</a></p>
      <p>“Leeds returned to form before the international break and will fancy their chances of making it three wins in a row. I can’t see past an away win.”</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leeds need three points on Saturday if they want automatic promotion this season and should travel to Luton with big confidence, as they have a formidable defence that doesn’t leak goals.</p>
      <p>It will be a great opportunity to try flex their muscles in front of goal and there is no doubt they need to improve in the attacking third.</p>
      <p>They are only outside the top two on goal difference as it stands, but have a great opportunity after the break to put some positive results together and really consolidate themselves as a serious promotion contender.</p>
