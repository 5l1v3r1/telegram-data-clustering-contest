      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Ajit Pawar blackmailed; he could come back: Sanjay Raut</li>
        <li>Shiv Sena, NCP, Congress in shock after morning coup</li>
        <li>Fadnavis, Ajit Pawar sworn in as stunned nation looked on</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Does Surprise Saturday need more drama? Yes, apparently. Would you believe Sanjay Raut now claims Ajit Pawar -- the rebel NCP leader who stunned nearly everyone by unexpectedly throwing his weight behind a BJP government in Maharashtra -- was <i>blackmailed</i>?</p>
      <p>And there's more. The Shiv Sena leader, who happens to be the executive editor of party mouthpiece Saamana, has promised to reveal the culpits in the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Raut even says there's a possibility that Ajit Pawar will come back.</p>
      <p>Five out of "8 MLAs" who went with Ajit Pawar returned, Raut said, adding that these lawmakers had been lied to, put in a car and "sort of kidnapped".</p>

      <p>For now, the Shiv Sena and the NCP are putting a united front in the wake of <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-devendra-fadnavis-sharad-pawar-ajit-pawar-bjp-ncp-1621904-2019-11-23">this morning's astounding developments</a>: an early-morning swearing-in, the sight of Ajit Pawar taking oath along with Devendra Fadnavis, the complete surprise expressed by top NCP leaders, including Sharad Pawar (Ajit's uncle).</p>
      <p>While Pawar senior has warned his MLAs against defecting -- pointing to the existence of an anti-defection law -- Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has described the BJP's move as a "surgical strike" against Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar has said that a decision on replacing Ajit Pawar as the NCP's legislature party leader will be taken at a later meeting.</p>
