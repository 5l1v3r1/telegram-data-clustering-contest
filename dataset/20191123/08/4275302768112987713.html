      <p>Drugs officers snared Colin Dickie with the £1,000-plus haul in July last year,<a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/angus-mearns/1021872/police-investigating-unexplained-death-of-steven-donaldson-killer-in-perth-prison/"> just weeks after his younger sibling had been charged with the murder of Arbroath man Steven Donaldson.</a></p>
      <p>Dickie’s appearance at Forfar Sheriff Court for sentencing on the drugs charges came <a href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/local/angus-mearns/1022441/in-full-freedom-bid-by-steven-donaldson-killers-fails-on-same-day-accomplice-found-dead-in-prison-cell/">less than a week after the body of his 24-year-old brother was found in his cell at Perth prison</a>, where he had been serving 23 years behind bars for his part in the savage killing of the popular Angus oil worker.</p>

      <p>Dickie, of Pitreuchie Place, Forfar, previously admitted possession of the drugs at a house in Montrose Street, Brechin, on July 25 last year. He was initially charged with being concerned in the supply of cocaine but a plea to possessing the Class A substance was accepted by the Crown.</p>
      <p>Depute fiscal Jill Drummond told the court police obtained and executed a search warrant in relation to information concerning illicit drugs.</p>
      <p>She said 13.2 grammes of cocaine, with an estimated value of £650, and 43.4 grammes of herbal cannabis worth £430 were discovered at the property.</p>
      <p>Solicitor Nick Whelan said: “He was in a bad place at the time with a known drug user and essentially they were buying drugs together.</p>
      <p>“He is in a much better place now. Unfortunately there is reference (in the social work report) to his brother’s situation,” added the solicitor in reference to Steven Dickie’s death.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t expect to see him here today, but he has treated this matter very seriously from the beginning and accepts full responsibility.”</p>
      <p>The court heard Dickie earns £2,500 to £3,000 a month running an offshore-related company employing four people.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Derek Reekie told Dickie: “This is possession of a substantial amount of drugs for your own use.</p>
      <p>“I see the circumstances and understand it was a combination of factors that led to this at that time.</p>
      <p>“Notwithstanding all the issues that surround your life, you are in a much better place.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate things are difficult for you at the moment, but I understand you are in a new relationship.”</p>
      <p>It is understood Steven Dickie’s funeral will take place next week.</p>
      <p>The discovery of the murderer’s body at HMP Perth on November 15 happened on the same day his accomplices in the Donaldson killing were mounting unsuccessful appeals against their lengthy prison sentences.</p>
      <p>
