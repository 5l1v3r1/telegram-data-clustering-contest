      <p>Mike Shipman obsesses over each and every one of his opponents, to the point where the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bellator/">Bellator</a> middleweight can think of nothing else.</p>
      <p>‘It’s like a very unhealthy relationship,’ he quips, perched on a chair at Bellator’s media day in London. Shipman fights domestic rival Fabian Edwards on Saturday night in the co-main event of Bellator’s last London event this year.</p>
      <p>Tension has been building between Edwards (8-0) and Shipman (12-2) for the last two years.</p>

      <p>Edwards has slated Shipman throughout the build-up, branding him ‘Sh**man’. Shipman was unmoved by Edwards’ taunts, explaining he’s prepared for him as he does every opponent.</p>
      <p>‘You have limited interaction face-to-face before a fight, but you do feel intensely connected to that person – whether you like it or not – for an entire camp,’ Shipman told <i><b>Metro.co.uk.</b></i></p>
      <p>‘I don’t hate any of my opponents. It’s business… that actually cheapens it, it’s more than business.</p>

      <p>‘We’re sharing an experience. In the build-up, you’re closer to your opponent that anyone else.</p>
      <p>‘You’re thinking about them all the time. It’s a weird thing. Then you get a release in the fight. That’s something you share together.</p>
      <p>‘Generally, I respect my opponents and I even like them as people. That doesn’t mean I can’t smash their faces in, that’s what we’re doing.</p>

      <p>‘There’s exceptions and Fabian will be one of those. He’s not from that school of thought. He doesn’t show any respect to his opposition.</p>
      <p>‘We have different philosophies. I’m not going to be his friend and I don’t have to be.</p>
      <p>‘I recognise that no one will pay to watch me shadow box. I need an opponent and I need Fabian. Love your enemy.</p>
      <h3>Shipman vs Edwards</h3>
      <p>
        <b>EDWARDS’ RECORD: 8-0</b>
        <br/>
        <b>6 finishes</b>
        <br/>
        <b>0 losses</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>SHIPMAN’S RECORD: 13-2</b>
        <br/>
        <b>13 finishes</b>
        <br/>
        <b>2 losses</b>
      </p>
      <p>‘I can’t be his friend, but I need an enemy. I need someone to clash with.’</p>
      <p>Shipman could have been a rugby player and tried his hand at a pro career before eventually relenting to the call of MMA.</p>
      <p>The London native was stopped by his parents from diving into combat sports as a youngster when cage fighting was still widely regarded as a blood sport. Shipman turned to rugby to quell his impulses.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve always enjoyed fighting and rugby was the more socially acceptable outlet for those impulses,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘At school, you’d get praised for being a good rugby player. You can let all the aggression out in a manner that was rewarded and congratulated.</p>
      <p>‘That was my outlet. In the back of my head I always knew I wanted to fight.’</p>
      <p>‘I loved playing rugby and really enjoyed it,’ he continued. ‘I did try and make a career of it. But eventually I had to ask myself was I better at rugby or at fighting?</p>
      <p>‘At that point in my life I was 19 and I was better at rugby than I was at fighting. For whatever reason, that didn’t sit well with me.</p>
      <p>‘That seemed backwards to me. Rugby was great, but it was a game. I was better at a game than what I viewed as a fundamental life skill.</p>
      <p>‘I guess that was the first time I realised I didn’t love rugby like I did fighting. I enjoyed it greatly, but I didn’t love every aspect of it.’</p>

      <p>Edwards has been relentless in his attempts to unnerve Shipman. Tensions eventually boiled over at the weigh-ins on Friday morning when a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/fabian-edwards-mike-shipman-weighin-melee-bellator-mvp-michael-venom-page-11201427/">heated face-off turned physical</a>.</p>

      <p>Security rushed in to separate the pair and removed Shipman’s team-mate, a furious Michael Venom Page, from the melee.</p>
      <p>Before the weigh-in clash, Shipman’s eyes gave nothing away when Edwards’ suggestion he had not changed in five years of fighting was put to him.</p>
      <p>‘He can tell himself what he needs to tell himself,’ he replied.</p>

      <p>With his latest obsession hurtling towards another violent end, Shipman explained why he’ll take particular pleasure in ending his ‘relationship’ with Edwards.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t especially like him,’ he said. ‘I don’t like the way he conducts himself or talks about his opponents.</p>
      <p>‘We have very different philosophies. That’s not to say I don’t respect him as an athlete. He brings some danger and some threats, but not enough.</p>
      <p>‘I’m the more dangerous man and the better fighter and I’m going to win on Saturday.’</p>
