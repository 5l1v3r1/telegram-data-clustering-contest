        <b>Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira could reportedly sign for Napoli in January with the club’s manager Carlo Ancelotti interested in signing him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Uruguayan international joined the Gunners from Sampdoria last summer on a transfer fee of £26 million according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44764063">BBC</a> and has made 65 appearances for them so far. As of now, Torreira has netted four goals while providing five assists.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This season, the 23-year-old has made 15 appearances for Arsenal but only four of the have been Premier League starts. Unai Emery has used him mostly as a central midfielder rather than his primary position which is that of a deep-lying midfielder.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/unsettled-arsenal-star-eyes-napoli-move-12416">Calciomercato</a> claim that Napoli manager Ancelotti is interested in signing Torreira in January with AC Milan and Inter Milan also keen.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan international would certainly be a fine addition for the Gli Azzurri who are currently 7th in the Serie A table. Torreira has played in Italy before, making 74 appearances for Sampdoria across all competitions.</p>
      <p>However, Arsenal may not be too willing to let go of the midfielder as he could well become a regular starter for them. There’s a good chance Emery could use him ahead of Granit Xhaka who has had a tough season so far.</p>
