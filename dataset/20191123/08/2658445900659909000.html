      <h3>Dayo Sobowale</h3>
      <p>I recall a popular Lagos  saying that  roughly translates to the conclusion that when you  see a slanted load on a k-legged person’s head,  the  fault is  not at the top, but the bottom.  I embellish that with another wise saying that   notes   that  when the fish is rotten, the fault is from the head.  These wise  cracks are also in a way scientific, in that they are based on empirical, observational  facts  and they  form the  basis   of my analysis of the topic of the day  from the various events that happened  in the world this week. I  intend to be coldly analytic and avoid   sentiment  because the issues involved are important and sensitive for the survival of ethical  standards and democratic values, which should   drive good  governance,  peace and prosperity in our time and age , especially in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>I  will  illustrate my   observations today with events in the US, Nigeria,  the UK, and Israel. In  the US there  is a  hostile,  legislative    albeit  verbal civil war,  going on in the US House of Representatives in the name of the Impeachment proceedings against the 45th  US president, Donald  Trump.  In  Nigeria the Nigerian President  who  got elected on an anti corruption reputation  and integrity, finally  found  his voice  and spoke out against  the waste of budget  padding with lawmakers additional  costs on budgeting, which has slowed down the economic  progress of Nigeria in the last ten years. In  the UK the coming Brexit   election of December 12 has  pitted a very socialist Labor campaign   against  a  high   spending  Tory one in a manner that both parties seem  to have thrown caution on cost  control and well  tried  austerity measures to  the wind in trying to woo  the British electorate,  one  which  has become disenchanted  with the last Parliament and politicians in general,   over the  last  Parliament’s foot dragging and dilly dallying  on   the  manner  of  implementation  of  Britain’s exit from the EU .In   Israel  where  an election was held recently and where the  result  was close, both  front runners  have not been  able to form  a government  and   now  the PM, Benjamin Netanyahu has been found guilty of corruption,  but has accused  his prosecutors  of  a coup  against   his person and government.</p>
      <p>Before going to the issues involved in today’s analysis let  me put on note,  the underlying sovereign reputation of these  nations in the comity of nations,  as well  as a brief observation on how they came to the present dispensation.  We  start  with the US which  is the world’s leading presidential  system with the principle of separation of powers that    seems to  be falling to pieces in the Trump presidency with  the Impeachment  proceedings showing clearly  that the US may  not really be  USA  but  a  very  polarized and Divided States of America- DSA.  In  Nigeria the reputation of politicians have always been  that of very corrupt leaders and even right now former  high  ranking  officers and   military  governors literally run the political system  especially  the legislature.  And   even though  the present president has waged an  anti  corruption war based on his honesty  and integrity, there is no denying that corruption is fighting back, even  as more revelations show that  it is becoming more difficult for politicians and bureaucrats to steal and siphon public fund under the  Buhari Administration.</p>
      <p>In  the case of the UK and the Brexit election, it  is clear  that Britain  can  no longer cut its coat according to its cloth or size. The cost of running the British Empire and  Colonialism  has made immigration   a political  nightmare  in  Britain and has led to Xenophobia and Islamophobia  culminating  in the Brexit referendum of  2016   and the next  election of December 12, 2019. In  the case of  Israel  the reputation of that  nation is that of a bully  state of the Arab  world   in the Middle  East  now getting  even  more  violent with  the support of the US  President   Donald   Trump  in making life  more difficult  for Palestinians  and making peace between  Israel  and the   Palestinians  an  impossibility in the Trump  era.</p>
      <p>Let  us  now look  at the issues involved in each nation,  starting with the US   where  you only  need to look at  the opening statements of the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, a Democrat  and see  how violently it portrays the US  president to witnesses  and  how it encourages and glorifies pro Democrats  witnesses to  the world and its audience even before they have uttered  a word.  Of  course the ranking Republican  in turn characteristically runs down the Democrats on their Russian interference allegations, the lies and insults on Trump culminating in what  he calls a  phony Impeachment process   that  he  thinks  lacks  merit  and is aimed at disturbing Trump  in running a government  he was elected to run by the US electorate,  and even making sure that he does not get elected in 2020.  Either  way the bitterness has so  deteriorated to the level  of  real  personality  clash and hatred  amongst  the members of the Intelligence  Committee and it is difficult  to  see a peaceful resolution of the process before it goes to the Senate  where Trump’s  Republican  hold  the ace . Definitely  in the US  Lower  House for  now,  one can say  that between the Republicans and the Democrats on this Impeachment process,  there  is no love lost and   it is ‘every  body  for  himself  and   the  devil take the hindmost  ‘in the pursuit  or  defence,  of  President Trump on Impeachment.  That  however is not the spirit of the separation of powers and checks and balances  supposedly   inherent  in the US  Constitution, as the US founding fathers  spelt  out at the beginning of the American  Republic.</p>
      <p>In  Nigeria the report of the ICPC   together   with   the Office   of the  Secretary    to the government   showed  clearly  that  the  anti  corruption  body  has  its hands  full  in exposing corruption in all arms of  government  in Nigeria. The  murk  of  corruption is really  deep  and the fact that the President  can  tell the legislature that it has nothing to  show  for the over   one trillion naira it has spent on constituency  projects it has forced on the government to have the budget passed, over the last ten years,  showed  that  the government  is  not succumbing to blackmail and has not  gone  to sleep while the thatched house  of  governance  and budgeting in   Nigeria,   is on fire.</p>
      <p>In   Britain the  new election has given the Labor and  Conservative  Parties new opportunities to go back  to their ideological  roots  and even  to adapt  or change their political  course to get power at the elections. Labor is brazenly socialist  and  almost  Marxist in  terms of   planned  nationalization of parastatals  and infrastructure. This is in contrast   to the privatization and marketization of the Thatcher era  that  made the   fear of  nationalization  an  issue  that gave her power then. The  Tories  have promised to spend money on welfare like they have not  done before. To  me pragmatism  and reality  have fused on  either side  and the  British  people will  profit  from this Brexit  or No  Brexit  election of December 12, no  matter who  wins.</p>
      <p>With  regard to Israel it  is clear  that Benjamin Netanyahu  is digging in against the rule of law  and the political  establishment in Israel. It  is clear  he has learnt  a few things from his mentor in Washington who is the US President. Show  me your friends and I will tell you who you are is an applicable  saying here. But  can he last and can  he act with the same confidence that has made him the longest serving Israeli  PM? Corruption corrodes authority and  leadership,   and  Netanyahu knows his people  are battle hardened and will  not cower in challenging his mettle  and integrity  to lead  Israel with the sword  of Damocles of Corruption  hanging around his neck. Just  as that of Impeachment  has become a luggage  of  contraband on the back of his mentor in Washington. Once  again long live  the Federal  Republic of Nigeria.</p>
