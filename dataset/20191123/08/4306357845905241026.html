      <h3>Harry Redknapp says Manchester City will have too much quality for Chelsea FC when the top-four rivals meet at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</h3>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions suffered a 3-1 loss to league leaders Liverpool FC at Anfield in their most recent top-flight fixture before the international break.</p>
      <p>The Citizens are nine points adrift of Jurgen Klopp’s side in the title race to cast doubt on their ability to retain the Premier League title for a third successive season.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s side have already lost to Norwich City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Liverpool FC in the Premier League this season to leave them off the pace in the title race.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will start the Premier League clash on Eastlands with a one-point lead over Manchester City following a 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge before the international break.</p>
      <p>The Blues have won their last six Premier League games to put Frank Lampard’s side in a strong position in the top-four race.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs manager Redknapp believes Manchester City will have too much quality for Chelsea FC on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>“Manchester City have now suffered three Premier League reverses and have slipped to fourth,” Redknapp told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“They never recovered from a slow start at Liverpool and now face a Chelsea team playing some inspired football under former player and legend Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>“This should be a real tea-time treat for Sky Sports followers and is undoubtedly the match of the weekend. The Pensioners are a point and place above the Citizens and despite some eye-catching results and performances, are still vulnerable when pitched against the better teams.</p>
      <p>“City will be determined to get back to winning ways and close the gap on the leading clubs. They are used to coming from behind and will feel confident all is not lost as far as retaining their crown.</p>
      <p>“This should be an entertaining affair with the hosts having too much firepower and overall quality to ensure success.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City were 6-0 winners against Chelsea FC in their last Premier League fixture between these two sides at The Etihad.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC appointed Lampard as Maurizio Sarri’s replacement in the summer.</p>
