      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — An electric company faces a deadline to respond to Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s threat to revoke the utility’s certificate to offer natural gas service in downstate New York</p>
      <p>Cuomo sent a Nov. 13 letter to National Grid on Tuesday giving the company 14 days to respond.</p>
      <p>That deadline will be up by midweek.</p>
      <p>National Grid denied natural gas service to over 1,100 customers since May. The company blamed New York’s rejection of an application for a $1 billion pipeline bringing natural gas from Pennsylvania’s shale gas fields.</p>
      <p>Cuomo says such a pipeline wouldn’t be in service until at least next year. National Grid has since reversed course and begun connecting customers.</p>
      <p>The Democratic governor claims National Grid took advantage of the public. A spokeswoman has said National Grid is reviewing Cuomo’s letter.</p>
