      <h1>Kandi Burruss Shares First Photo Of Her Baby Girl, Blaze Tucker, Featuring Proud Dad Todd Tucker — Real Housewives of Atlanta Fans Are In Love</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:04:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Todd Tucker and Kandi Burruss are happy to announce the birth of their baby girl. The <i>Real Housewives of Atlanta</i> stars also shared the first photo of their bundle of joy along with her name.</p>
      <p>Meet baby Blaze Tucker who was born on Friday at 6:54 p.m., and she weighed 8 lbs, 1 oz. Burruss and Tucker are already the proud parents of adorable 3-year-old Ace.</p>
      <p>The diva has a teenage daughter, Riley, 17, and Tucker has a 22-year-old daughter, Kaela. Burruss, who has been very opened about her journey with surrogacy due to her history with fibroids, explained that they were expecting twins, but one of the embryos did not make it.</p>
      <p>The Xscape singer confessed: “We actually was supposed to be having twins, and then one of them didn’t continue. I was sad at first, but then I just had to be grateful that the one made it.”</p>
      <p>One critic replied: “These women weak af for not carrying their babies. Ok, when they flip on you like Frankenstein, don’t say anything because a foreign entity nurtured them for nine months. Black women are acting slow af.”</p>
      <p>This person defended the businesswoman: “Do you know how IGNORANT you sound? First of all, Kandi carried all her other children but couldn’t carry this one DUE TO MEDICAL REASONS. Secondly, it is HER egg and HER HUSBAND SPERM that made that baby. The only connection that the baby will have is to its mother, KANDI, that she is the one that will be bonding with the baby from birth. No woman is “weak” for choosing not to die in the process of having a baby.”</p>

      <p>This backer had this to say: “It is just celebs to have a platform to talk about it. I know more than one person that has frozen their eggs and had fertility treatments. I know mad people who have miscarried. This isn’t new. Gabrielle Union had nine miscarriages. It wasn’t vanity…she tried. Beautiful name! Happy Birthday, baby Blaze! Congrats to the Tucker’s!💝🎉🎉”</p>
      <p>Another observer wrote: “These celebrities and their children’s names. May God bless the baby and the family good luck in trying to sleep Love one of your biggest fan. 🙏🏼⛪️🙏🏼🕯🌹❤️🎈♦️💋🇵🇷🦋🦋🦋🦋”</p>
      <p>Todd and Kandi have joined famous faces like Kim Kardashian And Kanye West on the list of people who have used surrogates.</p>
