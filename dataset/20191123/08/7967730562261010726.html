      <p>The difference between a professional and being "a bit lost" as a two-year-old worked out to be 1½ lengths as Destination made a winning debut at Kembla Grange on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Destination did everything to take up a position outside the leader before sprinting clear for an easy win, while favourite Mrs Maisel jumped left and went back to last before finding the line to run second.</p>

      <p>Mrs Maisel was left with too much to do, while the blinkered Destination was rolling along out in front and going through his gears.</p>
      <p>“He has got a lovely nature and gives himself every chance, and the race is half won when they do that,” Godolphin representative Darren Beadman said.</p>
      <p>"He is a very laid back type of colt. James elected to put the blinkers on him early, his first start in a race, which is a big call but he needed them. He just does what he has to do.</p>
      <p>"I was surprised when [Mrs Maisel] went back as it was going to be hard to give us two or three lengths head start knowing what our horse can do and how he performed in his latest trial, when he came off their backs."</p>
      <p>Mrs Maisel cost herself a chance of being closer when she jumped to the left and went about 10 horses from the fence. It left Tim Clark with no choice but to go back to last and ride for luck. She was strong late, but the damage was done.</p>
      <p>“She was a bit lost and when you give them a start in these 1000m race it is hard to make it up,” trainer Mark Newnham said. “It is something to work on.</p>
      <p>“I’ll probably give her another run because her effort was good.</p>

      <p>“When I watched it I thought Tim was restraining to get in, but she was actually just trying to come in behind because she went out so far when she jumped from the gates.”</p>
      <p>Clark added: "She just went left. I lost couple of lengths at the start, she just copped a bump and overreacted and that meant we were back.</p>
      <p>"She found the line well and is a nice filly."</p>
      <p>Kerrin McEvoy had no such problems on Destination and believes he could be one to watch in the autumn.</p>
      <p>“He’s tradesman-like out and into the race,” McEvoy said. “We weren’t mucking about, we were going along, he travelled, gave a little kick at the 250m and then he galloped out strongly.</p>
      <p>“Point him, press the button and away he went.</p>
      <p>“He’s a strong little fella, well developed, so it will be interesting to see how he progresses through Christmas and see whether he can stack up later on.”</p>
