      <h1>Marcelo Bielsa needs to use Argentine connection to bring West Ham-linked star to Leeds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:15:12+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>West Ham, Aston Villa and Sheffield United are reportedly interested in signing Argentine free agent Nico Gaitan after his contract with MLS side Chicago Fire expired – but should Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa consider joining the race?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/21/nicolas-gaitan-west-ham-aston-villa-free-agent">The Guardian claim</a> that West Ham are leading the race to land the 31-year-old, who is considered a Benfica legend after more than 250 appearances for the Portuguese club. However, the 19-time Argentina international is now out of contract.</p>
      <p>Following a disappointing spell with Atletico Madrid and a brief stint at Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang, Gaitan moved across the pond to the United States with Chicago Fire for the 2019 MLS campaign.</p>
      <p>He scored four times and created 11 more from central midfield in 28 games, but has chosen not to remain in the US. Now, three Premier League sides are keen but surely Leeds should take advantage of Bielsa’s Argentine connection.</p>
      <p>The pull of the Premier League is enormous and the trio of clubs interested in Gaitan certainly boast that advantage over Leeds, especially with Gaitan’s career beginning to wind down now he has entered his thirties.</p>

      <p>However, the lure of Bielsa, who has managed Argentina and is considered a legend in his home country – even Newell’s Old Boys Stadium is named after the Leeds boss – would surely prove enticing for Gaitan.</p>
      <p>Leeds could do with a player of Gaitan’s craft and eye for goal. From the middle of the park, Leeds have struggled for goals this season. Adam Forshaw is yet to score in Leeds colours, while Matuesz Klich has scored just one league goal all season.</p>
      <p>Tyler Roberts has returned to action, but the Wales cap is still young and sometimes somewhat naive – especially when playing in the 10 role. Bringing a player of Gaitan’s calibre, invention and guile would massively boost Leeds’ promotion chances.</p>
      <p>So, surely Leeds need to consider rivalling the Premier League trio for free agent Gaitan, and use Bielsa’s Argentine connection as a way of getting one over West Ham, Sheffield United and Villa.</p>
