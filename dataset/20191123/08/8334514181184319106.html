      <p>NAGOYA, Japan (Reuters) - South Korea and Japan will put discussions about their contentious wartime past back on the table, Seoul’s foreign minister said on Saturday, warning that a recent thaw in relations had bought them a little, but not much, time.</p>
      <p>Kang Kyung-wha made the comments to a small group of reporters on the sidelines of a Group of 20 (G20) ministers’ meeting in the Japanese city of Nagoya. Kang spoke after meeting with her Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi.</p>
      <p>“We bought time for intense discussions, but there’s not much time left for us,” Kang told reporters.</p>
      <p>On Friday South Korea reversed at the last minute a decision to let an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan expire. Kang hailed that as a breakthrough in relations.</p>
