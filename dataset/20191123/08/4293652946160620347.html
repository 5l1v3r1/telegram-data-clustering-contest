      <h1>Canada forces do-or-die doubles match in Davis Cup semifinal vs. Russia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:42:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/author/sportsnet-staff/" target="_blank">Sportsnet Staff</a></address>
      <p>Canada’s stunning run at the Davis Cup will come down to a doubles match to determine if they will advance to the Finals for the first time ever.</p>
      <p>Vasek Pospisil kicked the day off for the Canadians, taking on Russia’s Andrey Rublev.</p>
      <p>Rublev took the first set of the rubber match 6-4, using an impressive return game to put Pospisil on the back foot.</p>
      <p>The second set saw much of the same. After trailing 2-1 early, a double-fault gave Pospisil a break to get the set back on serve.</p>
      <p>But Rublev stormed back in the very next game, using quick foot work and well-placed returns to get his break back and take a 4-3 lead, en route to ultimately taking the set, and the match 6-4, 6-4.</p>
      <p>The win gave Russia a 1-0 lead in the Davis Cup semifinal, setting up a must-win matchup between Denis Shapovalov and Karen Khachanov to keep the Canadians alive.</p>

      <p>After trailing 3-1 in the opening set, Shapovalov broke Khachanov twice to come back and win the opener 6-4.</p>
      <p>But a double fault by Shapovalov in the second set gave Khachanov the chance to break and win, 6-4, forcing a decisive third set that Canada had to win to even the score with Russia and force a do-or-die doubles competition to determine who would advance.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov managed to break the third set, and then built that momentum into a 5-4 advantage, creating an opportunity for him to serve for the win.</p>
      <p>The Canadian came through under the pressure, taking the final set, and the match 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.</p>
      <p>With the win, Canada forced a win-or-go-home doubles match to determine if they will advance to the Davis Cup Finals for the first time ever.</p>
      <p>Pospisil will return to action alongside Shapovalov to try to make history.</p>
