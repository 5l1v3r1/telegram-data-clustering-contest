      <p>Joe Pride believes Kylease is back on the path to becoming a stakes winner after she held on to return to winner’s circle at the Kembla Grange stand-alone meeting yesterday.</p>
      <p>It might have only been a benchmark fillies and mares affair but it looked to have some depth, and Kylease showed some fight in the final 100m to win.</p>

      <p>Nash Rawiller, who had earlier scored on Mr Reckless, was at his front-running best, rating Kylease ($4.80) perfectly to produce strong late sections. Nevertheless, he though Handspun ($31) had got him on the line. But Kylease held on by a short half-head with Pumpkin Pie ($31) only a long head back in third and favourite Lucicello ($2.80) the same margin away in fourth.</p>
      <p>‘‘I thought I had got beat on the line because they went past me so quick,’’ Rawiller said.</p>
      <p>‘‘We saw the best of her over [the first] 1100m today, but that last 100 she had had it. She never lost her gallop until that last bit, when she was out on her feet.’’</p>
      <p>Kylease made a name for herself winning her first three in the autumn before being well beaten in the Hawkesbury Guineas as favourite. She came back in September but wasn’t the horse of the autumn in two runs as favourite.</p>
      <p>‘‘I thought I had her right,’’ Pride said. ‘‘But I think her performances tell us she wasn’t right.</p>
      <p>‘‘She just had a little bit of a virus early on in the prep, and it’s not until you put a horse under pressure that you really find those things out.</p>
      <p>‘‘She folded up too quickly at the two runs at Canterbury. I’m satisfied she’s spot on now. Michelle Red’s done a great job with her back home.’’</p>
      <p>Kylease rolled to the front, which was an advantage all afternoon, and showed her obvious talent which had Pride mark her a group horse. He is confident she will get there.</p>
      <p>‘‘To be fair to this mare, she’s going to improve a lot with this under her belt,’’ Pride said. ‘‘She’s always been a horse that improves with a bit of racing. Just good to see her back with the great speed that she can show. Nash didn’t have to ask for it. It was just here naturally. She built into the race and she’s run some time and beaten a decent field of mares.</p>
      <p>‘‘It’s just a matter of her working her way through her grades. I feel she’ll make it through to stakes grade no problem, but that’ll probably be in the autumn.’’</p>
      <p>James McDonald said Lucicello was looking for 1400m after failed to show the turn of foot she did winning first-up.</p>
      <p>‘‘She just wasn’t as fresh today and she just could give that sprint,’’ McDonald said.<br/>‘‘She is going really well and needs seven furlongs now.’’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dubbo trainer Kody Nestor will set his sights on Coonamble with Randwick dreams for Sneak Preview after he won the Highway Handicap.<br/>‘‘I have been thinking about the Country Championships for a while with him. I have three or four for it but he is putting his hand up,’’ Nestor said. ‘‘He can have three weeks off now and have another run before the heat at Coonamble.’’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Dubbo trainer Kody Nestor will set his sights on Coonamble with Randwick dreams for Sneak Preview after he wn the Highway Handicap at Kembla Grange on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Sneak Preview, which has recovered from a minor leg fracture as a three-year-old, still has a win before running himself out of Country Championships contention.</p>
      <p>"He has always had ability and it is just getting to the race now. We have been thinking about it for a while," Nestor said.</p>
