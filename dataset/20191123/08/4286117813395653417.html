      <p>The Congress on Saturday said the BJP has crossed "all limits of shamelessness" in complete disregard to the Constitution, hours after BJP's Devenedra Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra's chief minister with support from NCP's Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference in Mumbai, senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel also criticised Governor BS Koshiyari's decision to administer chief minister's oath to Devendra Fadnavis without verifying authenticity of the letter of support given by NCP's Ajit Pawar was unfortunate and will be remembered as a black moment in Maharashtra's history. He said the governor never gave the Congress a chance to form government even though other parties were invited.</p>

      <p>On Saturday morning, Ajit Pawar, who was recently elected as NCP's CLP leader, took oath as deputy chief minister after pledging support to the BJP. He reportedly handed over a letter of support signed by NCP MLAs but the NCP has distanced itself from this decision.</p>
      <p>The Congress said it will explore all legal and political options to form government in Maharashtra and that its alliance with the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) remains intact.</p>
      <p>Asked about the next course of action, Ahmed Patel said NCP chief Sharad Pawar will be holding a meeting with his party MLAs at 4.30pm today.</p>
      <p>"Sharad ji will decide what action has to be taken against Ajit Pawar and others and whether they need a new CLP leader and party whip. All Congress MLAs with us. We will explore political and legal options and together defeat the BJP during the floor test," Ahmed Patel said.</p>
