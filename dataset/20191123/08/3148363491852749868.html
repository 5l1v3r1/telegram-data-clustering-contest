      <h1>Far-Left Extremists 'Toast' Murder of Two Italian Police Officers</h1>
      <h2>A group of demonstrators, believed to belong to the far-left anarchist scene in Trieste, toasted the murder of two police officers who were killed by a migrant last month.</h2>

      <p>Dominican national Alejandro Augusto Stephan Maran <a href="https://www.corriere.it/cronache/19_ottobre_04/trieste-sparatoria-alla-questura-colpiti-agenti-10c85b2e-e6bc-11e9-9d63-abc92eac7ace.shtml?refresh_ce-cp">brutally murdered</a> police officers Pierluigi Rotta and Mateo Demenego on October 4th after the migrant stole one of the officer’s firearms and shot the pair with it.</p>
      <p>In footage released this week, protesters are seen celebrating their deaths while demonstrating outside the prison holding the killer, newspaper <i>Il Giornale</i> <a href="http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/trieste-comizio-choc-anti-polizia-i-due-agenti-uccisi-1787759.html">reports</a>.</p>
      <p>In the video, a woman can be heard on a megaphone or microphone describing the murdered officers as “mercenaries”.</p>

      <p>“Theirs was a conscious choice. Some people do it for the salary, some because they think they can help, some want a minimum of power. They fell doing what they did: that is, a service that damages freedom,” the speaker said.</p>
      <p>“In the bars of the city there were toasts for the death of the two policemen. A part of the city does not cry because it knows what the men in uniform do to those who rebel every day,” the speaker added.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Il Giornale</i>, the incident is said to have occurred last weekend, and that anarchists are likely the ones responsible due to the logos on the banners that are seen in the video.</p>
      <p>The General Investigations and Special Operations Division (DIGOS), which handle cases of terrorism and tackle the mafia, are said to be investigating the incident.</p>
      <p>Far-left extremist anarchists have become increasingly violent in Italy in recent years, engaging in acts of terrorism like <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/05/29/far-left-extremist-arrested-connection-salvini-party-office-bombing/">the bombing</a> of an office belonging to populist Matteo Salvini’s League in Treviso last year.</p>

      <p>Anarchists are also suspected of having been behind the <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/07/23/far-left-anarchists-suspected-sabotage-italian-train-chaos/">sabotage</a> of an electrical hub on the Italian railway network in July, with prosecutors labelling it an “act of war” and the perpetrators “terrorists”.</p>
      <p>In March, Italian intelligence officials <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/03/01/italian-intelligence-warn-insidious-threat-violent-far-left-anarchist-extremists/">highlighted the danger</a> posed by far-left anarchists, such as the Antifa group and others, saying that they had seen increased tendencies toward radicalisation.</p>
