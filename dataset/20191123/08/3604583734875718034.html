      <h1>Ballarat Turf Club announces project to give horses a better chance of life after racing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rochelle Kirkham</a></address>
      <p>The Ballarat Turf Club will invest in a new initiative to improve the re-homing of racehorses after their retirement.</p>
      <p>Outgoing chief executive Lachlan McKenzie announced BTC Life After Racing would be launched next year, during committee room speeches at Ballarat Cup Day.</p>
      <p>It will be an online platform for Ballarat-based trainers to log the details of any horse that is retired or considered unsuitable for racing.</p>
      <blockquote>It is something I am very proud the club has decided to do.<cite>Lachlan McKenzie, outgoing Ballarat Turf Club CEO</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Details logged will include age, sex colour, size, temperament and experience of the horse, as well as videos and photos, to aid the re-homing process.</p>
      <p>"The club is committed to then taking that information out into the broader community to anyone who is looking for a horse for a non-racing discipline - whether it be adult riding club, pony club, dressage, show jumping, Western riding or even just a pleasure horse for a pet," Ms McKenzie said.</p>
      <p>"We want to make sure any horse that is trained at Ballarat that is not suitable for racing for any reason can find a home.</p>
      <p>"We want to do our bit by being the conduit between those looking for a horse and those who have got them."</p>
      <p>Mr McKenzie said it had been stipulated that horses could not be sold for more than $500 on the platform.</p>
      <p>The announcement of BTC Life After Racing comes after Racing Victoria included a statewide re-homing program and a tracking system in its $25 million commitment to equine welfare in October.</p>
      <blockquote>Although it is a national issue even international issue, if we can do something about it in our own backyard that can only be positive.<cite>Lachlan McKenzie, Ballarat Turf Club outgoing CEO</cite></blockquote>
      <p>This widespread focus on horse welfare follows shocking media reports and investigations that revealed the cruel treatment and mass slaughter of retired racehorses and racehorses considered too slow.</p>
      <p>Investment in BTC Life After Racing was Mr McKenzie's last announcement as chief executive of the Ballarat Turf Club.</p>
      <p>He said the club was fully committed to the project and estimated it would cost around $20,000.</p>
      <p>"It is something I am very proud the club has decided to do," Mr McKenzie said.</p>
      <p>"Although it is a national issue even international issue, if we can do something about it in our own backyard that can only be positive."</p>
      <p>"I said in the committee room for my Ballarat Cup Day speech that I like making announcements. I was pleased to be able to make this one - it is one of my better ones."</p>
