      <p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — The leader of the militant Hamas group says the corruption indictment of Israeli prime minister raises the Palestinian people’s morale.</p>
      <p>Ismail Haniyeh told reporters in Rafah in southern Gaza Strip on Saturday that serious corruption charges against Benjamin Netanyahu were a sign “of more steadfastness” for the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>The leader of the group that controls Gaza also said the indictment means more “resistance, both popular and armed.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Israel’s Attorney General indicted Netanyahu for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes, making him the first sitting premier to be charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>The longest-serving Israeli leader is scrambling after two inconclusive elections this year and possibly an unprecedented third national vote early next year.</p>
      <p>The Islamist Hamas group won the 2006 Palestinian legislative polls, which were the last.</p>
