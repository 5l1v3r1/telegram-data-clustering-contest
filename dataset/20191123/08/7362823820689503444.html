      <h1>American reporter Jason Rezaian, held by Iran for 544 days, awarded $180M for captivity, torture</h1>

      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">Washington Post journalist</a> who was held captive and psychologically tortured by the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/iran">Iranian</a> government for 544 days was awarded $180 million Friday evening in his family’s lawsuit against the Middle Eastern country.</p>
      <p>Reporter Jason Rezaian was arrested at gunpoint in Iran along with his wife in 2014 on dubious espionage charges. He was a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran and was living there with his family at the time.</p>
      <p>“Iran seized Jason, threatened to kill Jason, and did so with the goal of compelling the United States to free Iranian prisoners as a condition of Jason’s release,” U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon in Washington, D.C., said in his ruling.</p>

      <p>“Holding a man hostage and torturing him to gain leverage in negotiations with the United States is outrageous, deserving of punishment and surely in need of deterrence,” Leon added.</p>
      <p>Rezaian was held at Tehran’s Evin prison and convicted by the Revolutionary Guard in a closed court on the unexplained spy charges.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Rezaian told The Guardian that "for the first six or seven months, [the threat of execution] was pretty regular.”</p>
      <p>"It was the constant anxiety of: 'Are they going to kill me, are they going to keep me forever or am I going to be released tomorrow?' You don't know what to believe. That's the method. That's the torture,” he said.</p>
      <p>Iran has not responded to Rezaian’s lawsuit and it’s unclear how the money would be paid – if at all. It could come from the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.</p>
      <p>This year the Trump administration designated Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, named as a defendant in Rezaian’s case, as a terrorist organization.</p>
      <p>Rezaian has not commented on the ruling.</p>
      <p>The Washington Post’s executive editor, Martin Baron, said in a statement on the ruling, “We’ve seen our role as helping the Rezaians through their recovery. Our satisfaction comes from seeing them enjoy their freedom and a peaceful life.”</p>

      <p>Rezaian was released in 2016 and wrote a memoir about his experiences this year called “Prisoner.”</p>
