      <h1>Crystal Palace contact Liverpool for Rhian Brewster ahead of Premier League clash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:55:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Roy Hodgson and Crystal Palace have contacted Liverpool about the possibility of signing Rhian Brewster in January, according to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/crystal-palace-make-contact-over-signing-liverpool-player/">Football Insider</a>.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/11/22/jurgen-klopp-has-surprising-rhian-brewster-transfer-u-turn-report/">reported yesterday</a>, Jurgen Klopp is now said to be open to the idea of Brewster going out on loan, given that he has made limited appearances for Liverpool’s first-team so far this season, and has spent a lot of time playing for the U23s.</p>
      <p>Brewster will play against Aston Villa in the Carabao Cup – fitness permitting – but other than that is going to struggle for minutes if the first portion of the season is anything to go by.</p>
      <p>With Xherdan Shaqiri potentially to come back into the fold as well as existing options such as Divock Origi, Klopp has plenty of other forward players to pick from, so a loan move could prove beneficial.</p>
      <p>A move to Crystal Palace, who have no striker likely to be capable of depriving Brewster of time on the pitch, seems to make a lot of sense.</p>
