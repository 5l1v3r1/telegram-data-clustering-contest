      <h1>Jurgen Klopp fears for Mo Salah with Egypt set to place more strain on the winger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:24:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Egypt are keen to take Mo Salah to the Olympic Games next summer, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7716287/Liverpool-manager-Jurgen-Klopp-fears-injured-Mohamed-Salah-possible-Olympic-call-up.html">Daily Mail</a>, with Jurgen Klopp said to be concerned about the situation.</p>
      <p>Having frequently spoken about the welfare of players and the risks of placing too much strain on them, Klopp is unlikely to be best pleased that Salah, for the third consecutive summer, could be featuring at a competitive international tournament.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, it was the World Cup in Russia, while this summer just gone, Egypt hosted the Africa Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>Salah would have to be one of three over-23 players for Egypt at the competition, and while, as a national hero, it is easy to see why his country want him to be there, off the back of another mammoth campaign, he really could do with not going.</p>
      <p>The winger is already nursing a knock sustained against Leicester City six weeks ago, and would only make himself even more susceptible to injuries if he has to go another summer without proper rest.</p>
      <p>It’s not just the strain that the extra matches have on his body, either. When Salah represents Egypt, his status in the country means there are other pressures on him.</p>
      <p>From both a Reds and an Egypt point of view – though, admittedly, perhaps more so the former – it is best that Salah doesn’t have to go.</p>
