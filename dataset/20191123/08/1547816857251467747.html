        <b>Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla fought like anything over the past week and obviously, Salman Khan is going to take their case in today's episode of Weekend Ka Vaar of Bigg Boss 13. He is very angry and in no mood to take any justification</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 is full of angry people. Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla fought with each other like cats and dogs over the past week and nothing could stop their fight. The house was divided over who is right and who is wrong. Today, Salman Khan will take their case and he is no mood to let any nonsense prevail. Salman Khan in the promo is seen bashing Asim Riaz, Sidharth Shukla and others for their violent behaviour. Especially, Asim Riaz, as Salman seems to be in no mood to let him talk.</p>
      <p>In the new promo shared by the channel, we hear Salman saying that the past week was the worst one in the history of Bigg Boss, in terms of fights. He clearly states that people fought for no reason and that it makes no sense to him anymore, to 'samjao' people. We hear Asim saying that 'what do you think about me' and Salman says, 'Aap chup hi raho toh acha hai'. Salman also takes Sidharth Shukla's case and says that whether he ever wants to fight with him outside the house. Asim Riaz states that he is ready to walk out of the house if he has provoked anyone to fight and Salman says he should better walk out then!

      <p>Another update that we have got to know is that Salman Khan will also be bashing Himanshi Khurana for her violent behaviour towards Shehnaaz Gill. In the fit of anger, Himanshi had pushed Shehnaaz and that has irked Salman Khan. He asks her to stop with her 'innocence' drama and that she can be thrown out of the house for the same.</p>
      <p>Boss, that's what happens when you piss off Salman Khan and the audiences.</p>
