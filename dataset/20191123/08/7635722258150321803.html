        <b>A man has died following an incident involving two men at Cloverhill Prison in Dublin.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardaí said they were called to the prison shortly after midnight last night.</p>
      <p>A man in his late 30s was treated by emergency services but pronounced dead at the scene a short time later.</p>
      <p>Investigators said the death followed an “incident involving two male prisoners in custody at the prison.”</p>
      <p>Gardaí are following a definite line of inquiry.</p>

        <b>Four houses have been damaged in a fire at a housing estate in County Meath.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardaí said the fire broke out in a van parked in the driveway of a house at Meadowbank Hill in Ratoath shortly before 4am this morning.</p>
      <p>It quickly spread and damaged a number of houses and a second car.</p>
      <p>Nobody was injured; however, four houses had to be evacuated.</p>

        <b>Actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen has launched a blistering attack on social media companies over their failure to tackle the proliferation of hate speech and misinformation online.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a speech Anti-Defamation League in New York, the Borat and Ali G creator said companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter are the “greatest propaganda machine in history.”</p>
      <p>He slammed Facebook for using free speech as an excuse to not take responsibility for lies, harassment and abuse posted to the platform.</p>
      <p>He said the company’s refusal to fact-check political ads would have allowed Hitler to deliver Nazi propaganda to billions of people around the world.</p>

        <b>There are renewed calls for the Government to consider a Compulsory Purchase Order of the land at St Vincent’s Hospital for the new National Maternity Hospital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes amid concern the project will face further delay with the Vatican yet to sign off on the transfer of the land for the project.</p>
      <p>Reports this week suggest pro-life groups are lobbying the Church to block the transfer because the new facility will offer abortion services.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin health spokesperson Louise O’Reilly is calling on the Government to issue a CPO to prevent the Church from ‘influencing or interfering’ with the project.</p>

      <p>The Children's Minister Katherine Zappone will be among the speakers at the closing ceremony.</p>
      <p>Dáil na nÓg Chairperson Caoimhe Wall said the environment will top the agenda – with transport, climate awareness and plastic crisis all up for discussion.</p>
