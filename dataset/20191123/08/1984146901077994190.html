        <figcaption>Why has Mike Ashley failed to sell Newcastle?</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>New quotes from Sir Jim Ratcliffe about looking at English clubs - including Newcastle United - illustrate one of the reasons why the Magpies remain unsold some two years on from Mike Ashley putting the club on the market.</p>
      <p>Petrochemicals billionaire Ratcliffe, worth £21billion, has recently bought the cycling team formerly known as Team Sky and owns Swiss club Lausanne. He also invested £110million in cycling’s America’s Cup and has bought Ligue 1 club Nice.</p>
      <p>He could still buy an English club but for the time being he has ruled out buying a Premier League club because the cost is too high. Quoted £3billion for Chelsea, he opted out of the Newcastle purchase because - it claims in the article - opportunities for St James' Park expansion "weren't great".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mike-ashley-pulls-plug-takeover-15917829">Ashley put United on the market two years ago</a> and has had interest but nothing at his price, which is understood to be between £300million and £400million. It would seem that Newcastle would be perfect for a man like Ratcliffe, who had been looking to add another football club to his portfolio.</p>
      <p>But quotes from the Ratcliffe camp would suggest that clubs in the top flight are pricing themselves out of the market as he looks over the Channel rather than at the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He said: "Ineos has always tried to take a sensible approach. We don’t like squandering money or we wouldn’t be where we are today. It’s part of our DNA, trying to spend sensibly. It’s quite difficult to make money so you don’t want to waste it."</p>
      <p>Ratcliffe bought Nice for less than £100million, which buys a club with a chance of tilting for the title in France – or at least making it into the Champions League in the coming seasons.</p>
      <p>For £300million, he would get Newcastle <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-set-up-internal-due-16016623">but there’d need to be another £100million of investment</a> in infrastructure and the playing staff to make them competitive. Which seems to be part of the reason for the lack of progress on the sale – Ashley believes he has a valuable asset but there’s not much value in it for investors who want to see a return.</p>
      <p>Ratcliffe isn't the only person to walk away. The group who were in talks with Sunderland over a buy out - and have now agreed a loan with Charlie Methven and Stewart Donald - also looking at Newcastle and Watford before deciding there was no value there.</p>
      <p>Newcastle aren’t the only club struggling to find buyers: most of the clubs in the top flight are unofficially on the market but few have seen the kind of heavyweight interest that you’d expect in such a lucrative market. The deep pockets of the owners of Wolves and Manchester City – along with the commercial clout of Manchester United – makes it difficult for any new owner to come in and really make an impact.</p>
      <p>Ratcliffe’s quotes would seem to hammer that home.</p>
