      <p>He has scored in four successive league games against the Eagles. No other Liverpool player in history has scored in more than two.</p>
      <p>Mane has netted 28 goals for his club in this calendar year in all competitions with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mo Salah</a> next best on 20.</p>

      <p>Liverpool have won the last four league meetings with Palace, a feat they had never previously achieved.</p>
      <p>They have won each of the last five at Selhurst Park in league and cup for the first time in their history, the last four of which have come in the league, scoring at least twice in each visit.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> Liverpool have won 12 meetings with three draws and five defeats, with six wins, two draws and two defeats at Palace.</p>

      <p>In the 20 <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> clashes there have been 72 goals scored at an average of 3.6 goals per game, with Liverpool scoring in all but two of the meetings.</p>
      <p>They have found the net in each of the last 12 top-flight encounters.</p>
      <p>There have been two goalless draws in all league fixtures between the teams—in 1979/80 at Selhurst Park and in December 1994 at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s biggest win at Palace was a 6-1 victory on the opening day of the 1994/95 season.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ biggest-ever top-flight league win came in September 1989 when they beat Palace 9-0. They set a league record when eight different men found the net.</p>
