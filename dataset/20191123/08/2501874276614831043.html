      <p>November 14, 2019, was a unique entertainment night to remember at the Ritz Carlton Bacara Hotel in Santa Barbara as Martin Scorsese walked the red carpet with presenters Leonardo DiCaprio and Al Pacino. The 35th Santa Barbara International Film Festival (SBIFF) honored Scorsese's “The Irishman” with the 14th annual Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film benefiting SBIFF’s free year-round educational programs.</p>
      <p>Scorcese generously spent time answering questions from the press and posing for photos on the red carpet as did Pacino, who is starring in “The Irishman” along with Robert DeNiro as Frank Sheeran, Joe Pesci as Russell Bufalino, Pacino as Jimmy Hoffa, Anna Paquin as Peggy Sheeran, and Ray Romano who was fabulous as Jimmy Hoffa's lawyer. Pacino's performance as Jimmy Hoffa was stunning. I saw the film at SBIFF Rivera Theatre this week and it is a masterpiece in directing and acting – a film not to miss! </p>
