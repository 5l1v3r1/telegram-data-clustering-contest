      </p>
      <p>It is reported that none other than Bohemian Rhapsody producer, Graham King, is working working closely with the Micheal Jackson estate to secure the rights on the late singers life and music.</p>
      <p>This means that a biopic on the life of Michael Jackson is set to go ahead, following the pop icon's family giving the nod to King.</p>
      <p>The controversial pop star's music will also feature in the flick, as reported by Deadline, with John Logan (Gladiator, The Aviator) appointed as screenwriter.</p>
      <p>And if you are thinking the feature film is going to be all sunshine and roses think again. In a film that is going to delve into Jackson's entire life, it's not going to be without it's controversies. What we will eventually see is going to divide opinions, in part, due to the complexities of the man who was MJ.</p>
      <p>Throughout his life, Jackson was accused of sexually abusing a number of children from the 1980's onwards. Of course, nothing has never been proven and these allegations are something Jackson himself, as well as his family, vehemently denied.</p>
      <p>The upcoming biopic marks the first authorised film about the star's life by his family. Jackson's life has been the focus of many television films over the years, the most recent being Leaving Neverland, the 2019 HBO documentary examining the alleged sexual abuse of two young boys.</p>
      <p>However, if Graham king is behind the movie, it's sure to be decent. Last year's Bohemian Rhapsody was a complete success, dealing with the life and sexuality of Freddie Mercury in a satisfying way. Bohemian Rhapsody grossed $903.7 million and scored six Oscar nomination in total including Best Picture.</p>
      <p>King and his production company GK Films recently made a deal with Paramount to make a film about The Bee Gees.</p>
      <p>At present, no movie studio has aligned with the Jackson biopic yet and no casting decisions have been made.</p>
