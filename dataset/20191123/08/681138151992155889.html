        <b>Part of a major road in a Suffolk town has closed due to a 'substantial' water leak.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A stretch of the A134 Springlands Way, in Sudbury, has shut while Anglian Water engineers repair the leak, which is near the junction of Grenville Road.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Constabulary said cars were seen driving through the water but the road has since been closed.</p>
      <p>The incident was reported to police at 6.13am, with engineers on the scene just after 7am.</p>
      <p>It is not know at this time what caused the leak.</p>
      <p>The closure is likely to affect traffic heading to the Bury St Edmunds Christmas Fayre.</p>
