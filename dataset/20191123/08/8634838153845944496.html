      <p>The suspect reportedly wrapped his victim's arm in her brassiere and threw it on the roof of a nearby residence where the student lived at around 5 a.m.</p>
      <p>Neighbours failed to respond to her cries for help because of fear.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>NTV </i>on November 22, doctor David Mbati from Bungoma West Hospital informed that the student's health condition had been stabilised after blood transfusion.  </p>
      <p>“The lady came in bleeding from an area that was cut, the left upper limb completely amputated. She came in having lost a lot of blood. Her state was semi-conscious although she is able to identify herself and give some history,” confirmed doctor Mbati.</p>
      <p>The violent act happened only a day before Kibabii University's graduation ceremony that happened November 22 and attended by University Chancellor President Uhuru Kenyatta.</p>
