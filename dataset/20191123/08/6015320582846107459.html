      <p>The U.S. President Donald Trump has said his administration is working on agreement with the Taliban following the release of Western professors, it has been reported.</p>
      <p>President Trump made the remarks in Fox News’ “Fox &amp; Friends”, according to CNN television channel.</p>
      <p>“We’re working on an agreement now with the Taliban. Let’s see what happens” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The Taliban group released the two kidnapped professors of the American University of Afghanistan in a prisoner swap which also resulted in release of three key Haqqani Network leaders.</p>
      <p>President Trump had earlier expressed that the release of the two professors would lead to ceasefire in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The Taliban group had also expressed hopes that the prisoner swap would aid peace process.</p>
      <p>This comes as President called off peace talks with Taliban in the month of September following a series of deadly attacks which killed several people in Kabul including an American service member.</p>
