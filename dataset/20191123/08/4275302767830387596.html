      <h2>A Fife man remains on life support following a serious crash on the A92 between Glenrothes and Kirkcaldy earlier this week.</h2>

      <p>Police have appealed to anyone who may have witnessed the accident involving a red Vauxhall Astra and a white Volvo lorry which took place at around 5.20pm on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Astra, a 41-year-old man named locally as Kevin Millwood, suffered significant life-threatening injuries and was rushed to Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital.</p>
      <p>Medics there said he is in a “critical but stable” condition in their last update on Friday morning, and is being continually monitored.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Ewan Pearce, from the Glenrothes Road Policing station, said: “We are asking for anyone who witnessed the crash, or was driving through the area around the time, to come forward with any information they have, which could help our enquiries.</p>
      <p>“Anyone with information can contact Police Scotland on 101, quoting incident 2547 of November 20.”</p>
      <p>The crash happened on the southbound carriageway of the A92 between the Bankhead and Glenrothes roundabouts.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said the red Astra had been wedged underneath the rear of the Volvo lorry’s trailer, with more than a dozen firefighters involved in cutting the driver free and subsequently removing the wreckage.</p>
      <p>The victim is understood to have suffered serious head trauma and a number of broken bones in the incident, while the lorry driver was uninjured but said to have been badly shaken by what happened.</p>
      <p>Police believe the Astra driver was returning home from his place of work in Glenrothes when the crash occurred, and officers would be interested in seeing any dashcam footage from vehicles in or around the area prior to the accident.</p>
      <p>The lorry’s trailer, minus the cab, remained in a lay-by at the side of the A92 on Friday morning as investigations into what caused the crash continue.</p>
