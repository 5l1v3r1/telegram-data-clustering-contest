        <b>The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, or AIHRC, in a new report claims that violence against women in the country has increased 8 percent with 2,762 cases this year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report, which was made public at a gathering in Kabul on Saturday, compares 2,536 cases of violence against women over seven months of last solar year—March 2018 to September 2018–to 2,762 cases in the same seven months of this solar year.</p>
      <p>This is an 8.2 percent increase in reported incidents for 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the report, 123 of the cases are sexual violence, and this a one percent increase from the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Moreover, 485 of the cases are “economically-related violence,” which is a 14 percent increase compared with the last year.</p>
      <p>Also, 1,400 of the cases are identified as acts of verbal or psychological abuse, which is a 37 percent increase compared with the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Some participants at the event called for an active role for women in decision-making and asked that more attention be brought to women’s rights in Afghanistan.</p>
