      <p>With the dates of 2019 Tata Steel Chess tournament and the Day/Night Test clashing in Kolkata, current World Champion Magnus Carlsen and five-time World Champion Viswanathan Anand rang the bell on Saturday, the second day of the second Test between India and Bangladesh, at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Carlsen and Anand were seen with the new Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief and former cricketer Saurav Ganguly a day before as the Tata Steel Chess Rapid and Blitz kicked off in Kolkata on Friday.</p>
      <p>Anand played a new role as he coached Souurav Ganguly at the ‘Draw of Lots’ ceremony against Carlsen. And now, Carlsen and Anand are set to be a part of the historic Day/night Test in Kolkata.</p>

      <p>Anand drew with Ding Liren of China and Wesley So of the United States before going down to Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia on the first day of the tournament. Meanwhile, Carlsen steered ahead of the rivals winning two and drawing one game and ended the day with five points overall as each of the rapid games are worth two points for a win and one for a draw.</p>
