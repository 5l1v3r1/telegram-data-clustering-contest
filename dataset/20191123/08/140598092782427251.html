      <h1>Amazon Black Friday 2019 deals: The best offers today, including 50 PC off Apple iPod Pro and Echo Dot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:03:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-russell/" target="_blank">Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>Typically ahead of the curve, Amazon launched its <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/22/best-black-friday-deals-2019-what-shops-uk-early-sale-offers/">Black Friday 2019</a> sales last Friday — a whole week before the official Black Friday date on November 29. It is not the only retailer to get a head start, however — John Lewis and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/currys-pc-world-black-friday-deals-best-predictions-2019-sale/">Currys PC World</a> have also jumped on the bandwagon and launched their November deals early. </p>
      <p>Yet Amazon is the Godfather of the Black Friday sales, as the retailer that brought over the shopping event to the UK from the States. Last year alone, customers saved over £40 million in the Amazon Black Friday sales, and this year should be no different. As the online retailer stocks everything from toothbrushes to beard trimmers, there are serious savings to be made (and early Christmas presents to be bought) across the board.</p>
      <p>Their deals this weekend comprise serious savings on televisions, laptops, headphones and more. Amazon-branded products (Echo Dot, Echo Show, Fire TV sticks, etc) also feature prominently in the sales. For more details, please see below for our round-up of the best Amazon Black Friday 2019 deals on offer today. </p>
      <h3>Today's best deals, according to The Telegraph</h3>
      <p>On the plus side, Amazon has launched hundreds of deals across a variety of tech and home appliances today. On the down side: that means you could be trawling on the site for hours.</p>
      <p>To simplify the process, we have rounded up our favourite products in the sale so far...</p>
      <h4>1. Echo Dot (3rd Gen)</h4>

      <p>The Echo Dot, much like the Amazon Echo, is a small smart speaker that uses Alexa to play music, answer questions, tell you the news and more.

      </figure>
      <p>The 10.5-inch iPad Pro may not be as swish as the newer 11-inch or 12.9-inch models, but it still receives rave reviews for its functionality - you can easily watch movies or catch up on your favourite shows on your commute, plus it has a fast loading time, 10 hours of battery life and is easy to use. As it is a slightly older model, there is an impressive 49 per cent discount being offered - which is generous for such a pragmatic model.</p>
      <p>If you want the kit with all the bells and whistles, however, there is a £200 discount on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07K576Q5X/ref=uk_a_ipad_1?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">11-inch iPad Pro</a> (now £719) and on the new <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07KM5RYMN?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">12.9-inch</a> (now £1,518.99). The new model has a larger screen, uses Face ID and has a slightly better front camera, but it otherwise similar to the original model.  </p>

      <p>Black Friday is the ideal time to finally stock up on those home essentials. Like, for instance, a new electric toothbrush. This offering from Oral-B has a round head, which is good for reaching those nooks and crannies between your teeth - which, according to Oral-B, could remove more plaque.  </p>

This deal will expire before midnight tonight, so don't miss out.</p>

      <h3>How to shop on Amazon this Black Friday</h3>
      <p>To prepare you for the havoc of Black Friday, we have collated some tips on how to check in and check out of Amazon, with your basket of deals, as quickly as possible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Create a membership.</b> Be sure to register as a new customer so you can check out your items as quickly as possible. You could even save your card details to really speed up the process.</li>
        <li><b>Sign up for Amazon Prime.</b> Amazon offer Prime members exclusive deals and early access to thousands of ‘lightning deals’ (the ones that usually sell out the fastest) 30 minutes before the rest of the internet.</li>
        <li><b>Keep track of the Telegraph’s </b><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/">live coverage of Black Friday</a> - so you can find the best deals as soon as they’re on offer. </li>
        <li><b>Pre-fill your basket.</b> Some savvy shoppers swear by pre-filling their baskets with rumoured products so they can check them out as soon as the deals go live. </li>
        <li><b>Shop around.</b> While Amazon does usually have great deals, it doesn’t hurt to browse the Shopping tab on Google for a better deal. </li>
        <li><b>Check Flubit for a better deal.</b> If you've found a product you like on Amazon, and you have a spare couple of hours, enter the URL into the <a href="http://telegraph.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fflubit.com%2F&amp;ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;currurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fblack-friday%2F0%2F13-black-friday-shopping-hacks-how-to-shop-online-like-a-pro%2F">Flubit</a> generator - it will tell you if there's a better deal elsewhere on the internet. This can take up to three hours and Flubit, which receives a commission on each deal it facilitates, does sometimes admit that Amazon has the best price on an item. </li>
      </ul>
