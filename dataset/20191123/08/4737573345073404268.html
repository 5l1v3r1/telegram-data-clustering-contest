      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) － Two more dolphins have washed up on a Penghu beach, on Friday (Nov. 22), following two similar cases of bottlenose dolphins dying in October.</p>
      <p>Their bodies were severely decomposed, said Lan Chih-lan (藍志嵐), of the Conservation Sector of the Penghu County Government. He added the animals had probably been dead more than 10 days before being found, according to the <a href="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/Penghu/breakingnews/2986642">Liberty Times</a>.</p>
      <p>The extent of decomposition made identifying a reason for their deaths difficult. However, Taiwan Cetacean Society (中華鯨豚協會) members identified the mammals as a bottlenose and a spinner dolphin, both of which are endangered species, and said they either got caught in fishing nets or there is something wrong with the ocean.</p>
      <p>Officials buried the dolphins on-site. Locals said they hoped experts could determine the cause of death, reported the <a href="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/Penghu/breakingnews/2986642">Liberty Times</a>.</p>
