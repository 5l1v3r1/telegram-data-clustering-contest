      <h3>Best Chromebook Black Friday deals to come</h3>
      <p>While there aren’t too many current discounts to scratch that Chromebook itch right now, that’ll change next week. One of the best deals that we’re anticipating is on <a href="https://bit.ly/2XzoDqN">Samsung’s affordable 11-inch Chromebook at <b>$89</b></a>. That’s down $100 from the going rate and is going to match the lowest offer we’ve seen prior.

      <p>Office Depot is also giving us another early look at some of this year’s best Black Friday Chromebook deals. While not quite as low as Samsung’s offering, you’ll be able to save $100 on <a href="https://bit.ly/37qwbAt">HP’s 11-inch Chromebook at <b>$100</b></a>. This model does rock some enhanced specs though by comparison, like 4GB of RAM. It’ll make a solid web browsing device that’s perfect for taking on-the-go thanks to a lightweight build.</p>
      <p>Google themselves will be getting in on the discounts this year, too. Starting<a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/18/google-store-black-friday-2019/"> next week</a>, you’ll be able to<a href="https://bit.ly/35kHN6r"> save up to<b> $648</b> on Pixel Slate starting at <b>$439</b></a>.
