      <p>The film has done really well enough to reach this far as after its release, many had written its obituary and had pegged its lifetime number as <b>125 crores</b> at maximum. The film has done far better than that and is one of those rare films which to have seen a turnaround from being classified as a disaster to actually emerge as a major success. It should conclude around <b>210 crores</b> lifetime.</p>
