        <b>Tonight’s episode of Casualty starts with paramedic Ruby Spark (Maddy Hill) standing in Jan (Di Botcher)’s office and telling her that she doesn’t want to be teamed up with Lev (Uriel Emil) again – and she feels so strongly about it that she says she’ll ask for a transfer if she has to work with him in the future. What could Lev have done to make Ruby feel so strongly about not working with him? All we’ve seen of him so far is that he’s a bit of a softie who rescues kittens. Does he have a more sinister side?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The action goes back to three hours earlier and a job where Lev’s actions made Ruby feel uneasy. Then they’re called to a man who’s injured and drunk, and who crosses a line in his behaviour with Ruby – but it’s what Lev does next that bothers her more. It turns out that Lev is hiding a very nasty secret from his past. Does his current behaviour prove that he hasn’t changed?</p>

      <p>It’s time for David (Jason Durr) to make good on his promise to Rosa (Jacey Salles) that he’ll pose as her boyfriend when her mother visits. Xiomara (Anna Savva) turns up a day early because she can’t wait to see Rosa and meet David. Rosa tells David he’ll need to have his best game face on to fool her mother – but does David actually have a ‘game face’? Luckily Xiomara seems to be taken in by their ‘relationship’ and is very impressed by David – but how will David react when she starts planning a future for him and her daughter?</p>
