      <h1>What UK time is Deontay Wilder vs Luis Ortiz? Fight start time and ring walks</h1>
      <h2>Wilder takes on Ortiz for the second time, 18 months after he was rocked by the dangerous Cuban</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder takes on Luis Ortiz for the second time tonight in an eagerly-awaited heavyweight rematch.</p>
      <p>The American was rocked by the tricky Cuban 18 months ago before stopping the 40-year-old in the 10th round.</p>
      <p>Wilder went on to struggle to a controversial draw with Tyson Fury while Ortiz has won three routine fights.</p>
      <p>Should Wilder successfully defend his heavyweight title, he is scheduled to face Fury for a second time on February 22.</p>
      <p>But that will depend on whether the champion emerges unscathed from what promises to be a tricky night.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about tonight's fights...</p>
      <h3>What time is the fight?</h3>
      <p>The fight will start at 5am UK time which is 9pm in Las Vegas where the fight is being held. Ring walks are unlikely to take place earlier, even if the undercard fights finish ahead of schedule.</p>

      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> has revealed his daily diet ahead of his clash with Luis Ortiz at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Wilder beat Ortiz in 2018 in a topsy-turvy fight, with 'The Bronze Bomber' eventually winning by technical knockout in the tenth round.</p>
      <p>If Wilder overcomes Ortiz this weekend he could be set for a mouthwatering rematch with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> following their draw last year, with February 22 2020 the proposed date.</p>
      <p>And Wilder took <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hs-1M91nTN0">AL.com</a> through exactly what he is required to eat in order to prepare him for his fights.</p>
      <p>"I eat me a good breakfast from pancakes, to Polish sausage, to patty sausage and some good eggs," he said.</p>
      <p>"One morning I will eat egg McMuffins and it will rotate throughout breakfast time with that.</p>
      <p>"I come back again at 11.30am, eat a nice Alfredo chicken pasta with corn on the cob, maybe have some nice garlic bread toasted alongside that with a protein shake. I will also have a protein shake in the morning with the breakfast.</p>
      <p>"2pm will be a sandwich, you know, maybe ham and cheese, maybe tuna, with two boiled eggs.</p>
      <p>"The 5 o'clock [meal] will consist of a Salisbury steak, with mashed potatoes and green beans and I eat a lot of red potatoes; I eat a lot of yams.</p>
      <p>â€œAnd then a 7.30pm, I have a nice T-Bone steak, some more red potatoes, we might have some squash in there and some green beans."</p>
