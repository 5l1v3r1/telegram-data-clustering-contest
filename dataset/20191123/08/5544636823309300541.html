      <p>An undischarged <a href="http://concisenews.global/biafra-news">Biafra</a> civil war bomb has been found by some workers at a construction site in Adabebe village, in Amawbia, Awka South Local Government Area of Anambra State, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>The bomb was handed over to the Explosives Ordinance Disposal (EOD) unit of the State Police Command, who dismantled it.</p>
      <p>According to the Police Public Relations Officer for Anambra, Haruna Mohammed, the weapon was a mortar bomb, adding that it was dug up by an excavator digging the foundation for the construction of a perimeter fence.</p>
      <p>Mohammed in a statement said, “although, the weapon did not explode at the construction site, the Police found out that it was still very potent and could wreak great havoc if mishandled.”</p>
      <p>The excavator, simply identified as Onyekachukwu, said he initially thought the weapon was a tuber of yam given its shape, but that when he brought it out, he discovered that it was a bomb.</p>

      <h3>Hate Speech Bill: Are You Mad? – Nnamdi Kanu’s Counsel Asks Buhari</h3>
      <p>In related news, a Counsel to the leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (<a href="http://concisenews.global/biafra-news">IPOB</a>), Nnamdi Kanu, Barrister Aloy Ejimakor has <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/22/hate-speech-bill-are-you-mad-nnamdi-kanus-counsel-asks-buhari/">berated the Muhammadu Buhari-administration for initiating the hate speech bill</a>.</p>
      <p>The legal practitioner criticised the Nigerian president’s “tribalism” while also accusing his government of “murdering innocent IPOB members”.</p>
      <p>Ejimakor wrote on his known Twitter handle on Friday: “Buhari’s crass TRIBALISM promotes HATE more than the worst form of any <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HateSpeech?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HateSpeech</a>. You promote hate by murdering the INNOCENTS (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IPOB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IPOB</a>) while pampering the TERRORISTS. You hate &amp; persecute Ndigbo, and when they react with strong words, you call it Hate Speech. Are you mad?”.</p>
