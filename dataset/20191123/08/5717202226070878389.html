      <h1>Martin Keown hits out at Unai Emery’s treatment of Lucas Torreira at Arsenal</h1>
      <h2>Keown wants to see the 23-year-old midfielder become a regular in the side.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:15:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown feels that Unai Emery’s treatment of Lucas Torreira has proved a tipping point in his relationship with the fans.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/unai-emerys-treatment-lucas-torreira-turned-arsenal-fans-manager-claims-martin-keown-11196659/?ito=newsnow-feed?ito=cbshare">Metro</a>, Keown said he doesn’t understand why the 23-year-old doesn’t play and suggests that the Granit Xhaka situation came to a head because it was Torreira who was left out of the side.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/unai-emerys-treatment-lucas-torreira-turned-arsenal-fans-manager-claims-martin-keown-11196659/?ito=newsnow-feed?ito=cbshare">said</a>: “Torreira has not been playing full stop. I’d like to see him in the Arsenal midfield. It doesn’t matter as long as he is in the team. He hasn’t played enough for me. Very obvious that he has to play. He’s tenacious. The Chelsea game at home, the Liverpool game at home last season, he was playing in that team and Arsenal looked better for it.</p>
      <p>“This is why I think the fans went against Emery because Xhaka played no matter what when Torreira had to sit on the bench. Maybe it’s Xhaka he needs to take out.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Emery’s treatment of Torreira has been utterly bizarre</h3>
      <p>Emery knew he needed a combative holding midfielder as soon as he got the Arsenal job and signed one of international class in Torreira.</p>
      <p>But he seemed to lose faith in the 23-year-old last season and has increasingly tried to convert him into a more attacking midfielder, which is not his game at all.</p>
      <p>Torreira offers the same energy as Xhaka, but more discipline positionally and in the tackle as well as experience as a genuine anchorman.</p>
      <p>Why Emery has so quickly gone off the man he brought to the club is anyone’s guess.</p>
