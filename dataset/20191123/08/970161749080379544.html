      <p>A former military man who is confined to a hospital bed says he has been told to ‘get a job’ by the government.</p>
      <p>Kevin Barnes gets just £16 a month in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/universal-credit/">Universal Credit</a> and has been told he must show he is serious about getting back into employment.</p>
      <p>Kevin’s life was turned upside down a month ago when surgeons decided his leg needed to be removed.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old, who served in the Royal Navy for 17 years, had been suffering with severe circulatory problems and now has to adjust to life in a wheelchair.</p>
      <p>Despite this Kevin, from Plymouth, Devon, has been told by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that he can only claim £16 a month in Universal Credit.</p>
      <p>This has left him unable to pay his £410 monthly rent and he is now in dire straits.</p>

      <p>Kevin said: ‘I’m supposed to be looking for work in the future, enhancing my CV, this that and the other.</p>
      <p>‘But I cannot plan for work at the moment. I now have to prepare myself for being in a wheelchair all the time and get used to that.</p>
      <p>‘Then there’s the prosthetics – I have my first meeting for that as well.’</p>

      <p>Kevin served in the armed forces for 17 years as a Petty Officer Engineering Technician and is now entitled to a military pension.</p>
      <p>The pension pays out £500 a month but the DWP say this is considered ‘income’ and therefore won’t give him any more than £16 a month in benefits.</p>
      <p>Kevin is currently also receiving £81.90 a week in Personal Independent Payment (PIP) but that is set to stop once his hospital stay exceeds 28 days – in about a week’s time.</p>
      <p>The father-of-two has praised the local Jobcentre but said the benefits system needs to be revised.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I had been working and I expect to work.</p>
      <p>‘I just thought I would be working and my naval pension would be a bit of a bonus, but it’s turned out to be my main source of income.</p>
      <p>‘Because it’s considered a source of income, they take it away from you. They say, you can afford to pay your own rent.’</p>

      <p>Kevin is still paying rent on his home but it has been deemed unsuitable to meet his needs as a wheelchair user and housing officials need to find him somewhere new.</p>

      <p>The former military man served from 1972 to 1989 and is still proud of his work.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I went to a Remembrance service and had some friends come and pick me up in a taxi.</p>
      <p>‘I always go to Remembrance Sunday, I put my medals on and enjoy it.</p>
      <p>‘But they took me and there I was, at kids’ height, rather than the average 5ft 10ins guy, in a wheelchair – for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a totally different way of looking at life. Even to go down a path, and finding the steps at the bottom and thinking “Oh Christ, what do we do here?”</p>
      <p>‘And going to a local pub afterwards on the Barbican, we couldn’t go in without two people potentially picking me up.</p>
      <p>‘All of these things are coming into my life now – I can’t do anything for myself anymore. My life has totally, totally changed.’</p>
      <p>The DWP said they were now reviewing whether Kevin can work and claim more money in light of his new circumstances.</p>
      <p>A DWP spokesman said: ‘Mr Barnes’ capability assessment was completed before his operation.</p>
      <p>‘In light of his current health situation, staff are of course reviewing his Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payments.</p>
      <p>‘Income such as occupational pensions are always taken into account when calculating means tested benefits.’</p>
