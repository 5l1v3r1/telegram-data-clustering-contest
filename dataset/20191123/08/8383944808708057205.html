      <h1>Turkey will seek alternatives if F-35s not acquired: defense minister</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T08:38:44+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 08:38</time> by <a rel="author">ANADOLU AGENCY</a></address>
      <p>The Turkish defense minister said Saturday the country would search for alternatives it the U.S. fails to deliver F-35 fighter jets “for any reason.”</p>
      <p>"All should be aware that Turkey will have to look for alternatives if F-35s [jets] cannot be acquired for any reason," National Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said at an interview with Al Jazeera.</p>
      <p>Hulusi Akar underlined Turkey's recently-bought Russian S-400 missile defense systems would not be integrated into Turkey's defense system and that they would instead be part of a "stand-alone system".</p>
      <p>"That's what we have been saying since the beginning [of the dispute with the U.S.]. It [S-400] will definitely be a 'stand-alone' system. We are not going to integrate this with the NATO systems in any way. It will operate independently," he said.</p>
      <p>Emphasizing that Turkey has fulfilled its responsibilities as one of the partner countries in the F-35 program, he said the country's allies -- particularly the U.S. -- should do their part accordingly.</p>
      <p>Akar said a previous attempt by Turkey to buy U.S.-made Patriot defense systems had been rejected, after which Ankara purchased the S-400 system.</p>
      <p>Turkey's acquisition of the advanced Russian S-400 air defense system prompted the U.S. administration to remove Turkey from the F-35 fifth-generation joint strike fighter program in July.</p>
      <p>The U.S. maintains that the system could be used by Russia to covertly obtain classified details on the jet and is incompatible with NATO systems.</p>
      <p>Turkey, however, counters that the S-400 would not be integrated into NATO systems and would not pose a threat to the alliance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Developments in Syria</b>
      </p>
      <p>Akar said joint Turkish-Russian patrols in northern Syria were useful in monitoring developments in the area, where Turkey launched an anti-terror operation to clear the area of terrorists and ensure the safe return of Syrian refugees.</p>
      <p>"I believe these patrols will be much more beneficial and successful in the coming days," he added.</p>
      <p>Noting that Ankara and Moscow had agreed on the withdrawal of the PKK/YPG terror organization and affiliated groups from the region, Akar stressed that PKK/YPG terrorists were still present in the area and that they had harassed Turkish troops in recent days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Turkey respects Syrian territorial integrity</b>
      </p>
      <p>Akar highlighted that Turkey, since the eruption of civil war in Syria in 2011, has always respected Syrian political and territorial integrity.</p>
      <p>"We don't have intentions on anyone's territory. Our sole wish and goal is the security of our country and nation," he said, adding that the PKK/YPG and Deash, also known as ISIS, terror groups were Turkey's main concerns.</p>
      <p>Akar said PKK/YPG terrorists have carried out at least 1,200 mortar and rocket attacks in recent days on people living east of the Euphrates River.</p>
      <p>He added that a total of 22 Turkish people were killed and 200 others wounded following the terror group's attack on Turkish border cities following the start of Operation Peace Spring.</p>
      <p>He went on to say that Turkey would never target civilians in its operation and that it had taken measures not to harm civilians, the environment and historical and religious buildings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Situation in Idlib</b>
      </p>
      <p>Asked about recent developments in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib, Akar said the Bashar al-Assad regime did not respect an ongoing ceasefire and violated agreements.</p>
      <p>"...[Assad regime] tried hard to violate the truce at every opportunity. Of course, one can say that they also received some help from the Russians," Akar said.</p>
      <p>"Since May 6, about 1,100-1,200 Syrians lost their lives and the majority of them were civilians. Also, we know that 600,000 people abandoned their homes. Hence, it's a serious humanitarian tragedy," he added.</p>
      <p>Turkey on Oct. 9 launched Operation Peace Spring, to eliminate the terrorist PKK/YPG from northern Syria east of the Euphrates River in order to secure Turkey's borders, aid in the safe return of Syrian refugees, and ensure Syria's territorial integrity.</p>
      <p>Ankara wants PKK/YPG terrorists to withdraw from the region so that a safe zone can be created to pave the way for the safe return of some two million refugees.</p>
      <p>In its more than 30-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK -- listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and EU -- has been responsible for the deaths of over 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. The YPG is the PKK's Syrian offshoot.</p>
