      <p>Black Friday is coming, but are you prepared to make the most of it?</p>
      <p>Whether you're hoping to save on your Christmas shopping or want to pick up a few bargain treats for yourself, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">November 29 and the days leading up to it</a> can be the best time to buy, as retailers big and small drop their prices in spectacular pre-Christmas sales.</p>
      <p>But for less savvy shoppers, Black Friday can also be a day to get ripped off.</p>
      <p>So how do you avoid the deals that have been manipulated to look better than they are, or even the outright scams? And how can you ensure you're best-placed to get everything on your wishlist at the best possible price.</p>
      <p>Online sales checker <a href="https://www.lovethesales.com/">Love the Sales</a> have accumulated a few insider tips you need to know about. Here are our favourites:</p>
      <h3>Sign up to retailers’ promotional emails  </h3>
      <p>Sign up to retailers’ marketing emails before Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Many share exclusive Black Friday deals and promotions via email as early as the beginning of November.</p>
      <p>Offers will range from insider benefits and voucher codes to newly released deals and countdown offers, so this can be the best way to get the lowest prices.</p>
      <h3>Use price history tools</h3>
      <p>It looks like a good deal, but is it really a significant saving? Price history tools let you see how the cost of a product has changed over time. Check to see if that Black Friday deal is actually a good deal, or if it is just made to look like one.</p>
      <p><a href="https://pricespy.co.uk/">PriceSpy</a> is a UK site that has the price history of tens of thousands of products.</p>
      <p><a href="https://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/">CamelCamelCamel</a> is a similar tool, but specifically for Amazon products.</p>
      <p>If you enter the URL of any Amazon product into the toolbar you’ll see the price history as far back as five years.</p>
      <p>How useful can these tools be?</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/20/black-friday-cheaper-which-best-bargains">Which?</a> investigation in 2018 found a significant number of Black Friday deals were actually cheaper before the sales event.</p>
      <p>So if you’re thinking of buying a big purchase like a technology product over Black Friday, use a price history tool.</p>
      <h3>Use price comparison sites</h3>
      <p>Comparison sites or aggregators are a no brainer.</p>
      <p>They create a marketplace where you find items you would most certainly have missed if you were just searching Google.</p>
      <p>This is because smaller brands get overshadowed by big giants in Google, but smaller stores have great deals to offer too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lovethesales.com/">Love the Sales</a> is a comparison site that hosts deals from the small stores right up to the giants. You can check thousands of retailers’ Black Friday deals, in one place, so you don’t miss a deal on the day.</p>
      <h3>Avoid online queues to access websites</h3>
      <p>With huge traffic increases to websites on Black Friday, you can get caught in holding screens as retailers hold some customers back to stop their site from crashing.</p>
      <p>This is because most online shoppers come through the homepage of a retailer's site.</p>
      <p>One way around this is to bookmark the products you want before Black Friday. Come the day, go directly to the item’s URL, bypassing the homepage traffic.</p>
      <h3>Look out for the fake user reviews</h3>
      <p>In an investigation this year, Which? exposed thousands of <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2019/07/exposed-the-tricks-sellers-use-to-post-fake-reviews-on-amazon/">manipulated Amazon reviews</a> that boosted the ratings of poor products.</p>
      <p>They have also done studies where this occurs on eBay and in certain Facebook groups.</p>
      <p>Which? advises shoppers to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Be wary of big review numbers</b> - if there are a large number of positive reviews for a relatively unknown brand or product, something might be fishy.</li>
        <li><b>Find the most recent reviews</b> - Amazon order their reviews by those voted most helpful by readers. Sort reviews by most recent to get an updated picture of the product as a new iteration might have launched in the last few years.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Get money off for being a new customer</h3>
      <p>Retailers will regularly offer 10%, 20% or even 30% off your first purchase, to get you onto their email database.</p>
      <p>If you are already going to sign up for their promo emails and newsletters (see tip 1), look out for the extra % off codes via pop ups and at the bottom of homepages.</p>
      <h3>Make the checkout faster</h3>
      <p>The best Black Friday deals can be snapped up quickly.</p>
      <p>In order to get the product you want without it going to another lucky punter, you need to be a credit card number ninja.</p>
      <p>Here is a speed round of useful tips to make the check out a faster experience.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Keep your card details to hand.</li>
        <li>Save your payment details and preferred shipping address on the retailer’s website before Black Friday.</li>
        <li>Save your details on <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142893?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en-GB">Google Chrome</a>. Google will auto-suggest payment options at checkout.</li>
        <li>Apple pay - make sure that your thumbprint is recognised and ready to go.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All of the above will save you time at the checkout and help you secure your deals, faster.</p>
      <h3>Filter by your sizes on Love the Sales</h3>
      <p>There's little worse than finding a product you like, that’s on sale, but your size has already sold out.</p>
      <p>You can make life easier by <a href="https://www.lovethesales.com/signup">creating an account</a> on Love the Sales.</p>
      <p>In your account, you can save all your sizes, from shoes to shirts.</p>
      <p>You can then shop sales that are only available in your size.</p>
      <h3>Beware of Black Friday scammers</h3>
      <p>Black Friday is a scammers' paradise.</p>
      <p>If you’re downloading a retailer’s app for the big shopping event, make sure it isn’t a fake.</p>
      <p>According to The Sun, the top 10 fashion brands have had more than 17 scamming apps each, trying to pass off as themselves and trick unknowing customers.</p>
      <p>Look for dodgy signals. For example, does the retailer’s app have the right amount of reviews for its stature? Make sure you’re aware of the retailer you are purchasing from.</p>
      <p>Malware protection is a must for online browsers. Security brands like <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/en-gb/index.html">McAfee</a> offer software to protect from cyber threats for as little as £10.</p>
