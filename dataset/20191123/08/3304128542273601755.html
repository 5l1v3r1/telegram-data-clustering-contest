      <p>Tanzanian songstress Vanessa Mdee cannot stop gushing about her new found love, American-Nigerian star Olu Rotimi Akinosho alias Rotimi.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Millard Ayo, the sensational singer could not stop smiling when talking about the “Power” actor who was in Nigeria for a couple of days.</p>
      <p>During the interview, Vanessa referred to Rotimi as “The One”, adding that the attraction was instant and is looking forward to spending the rest of her life with him.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Never Ever </i>crooner, they met at the Essence Festival in July and as they say, the rest is history.</p>
      <p>Only a few months into the relationship, Vanessa said the actor is the best thing to ever happen to her. He, Rotimi, has changed her life, she told Ayo.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Rotimi has more knowledge than I do. He is a guy who advises me. Advice that I have not been given by anyone. Sitting with him can make you think “what have I been doing with my life?”. It is like I was doing nothing with my life,” she said.</i>
      </p>
      <p>She further noted that he is a generous, God fearing individual whose outlook on life is amazing.</p>
      <p>Asked if she wants to settledown with Rotimi, Vanessa said she would like that very much but only if God wills.</p>
      <p>On matters, ex lover Juma Jux, the hitmaker declined to comment, noting that she would rather talk about her new relationship.</p>
      <p>She did however wish him well.</p>
      <p>Last week, Jux bashed his ex for whining on social media months after their break up.</p>
      <p>The Sugua singer wondered why she was complaining when she is the one who had ended things.</p>
      <p>Jux is dating a Chinese woman, Nayika.</p>
