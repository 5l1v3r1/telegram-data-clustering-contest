      <p>TOKYO — Pope Francis arrived on Saturday in Japan, the second leg of a week-long Asian trip whose main aim is to bring an anti-nuclear message to Nagasaki and Hiroshima, the world’s only cities to suffer atomic bombing in wartime.</p>
      <p>Francis, a determined anti-nuclear campaigner who will read a message on nuclear weapons in Nagasaki, will also meet survivors of the March 11, 2011 nuclear meltdown at Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.</p>
      <p>The pope touched down in Tokyo after flying from Thailand for a four-day visit that will be the first in 38 years and only the second in history.</p>
      <p>Another goal of his visit is to encourage the Catholic community in Japan, where just about 1 percent of the population identifies as Christian, about half of them Catholic.</p>
      <p>He will say two Masses, one in Nagasaki and one in Tokyo, as well as meeting Japanese officials and Emperor Naruhito. (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Writing by Elaine Lies; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)</p>
