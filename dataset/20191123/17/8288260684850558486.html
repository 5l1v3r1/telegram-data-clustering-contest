      <h1>Nuno makes a demand of his Wolves players after Bournemouth win</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers made it back-to-back Premier League wins with a 2-1 success at Bournemouth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:44:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Husband, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/ben-husband/</a></address>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo wants his Wolverhampton Wanderers squad to use their first half performance at Bournemouth as a 'reference' for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>Wolves were two up before the break, as <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bournemouth-1-wolves-2-reaction-17306221">goals from Joao Moutinho and Raul Jimenez set them on their way to a 2-1 win at the Vitality Stadium.</a></p>
      <p>In a stunning first half, Wolves had countless chances and ended the first 45 with a man advantage after Simon Francis, who endured a torrid return from injury, was dismissed for a second bookable offence.</p>

      <p>However, after half time, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> rode their luck and following Steve Cook's header they had to cling on to earn their three points.</p>
      <p>But despite their second half struggles, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno</a> was pleased with his team's performance.</p>
      <p>“I think it was a good game, honestly," he said. "I think first half we played very good, we played really, really well.</p>
      <p>“Balanced, creating chances, always with good possession, organised. I think we achieved the advantage.</p>
      <p>“Then with one man less, until the end of the first half we managed well. In the second half, we knew that Bournemouth are a very good team. Very good players, Eddie [Howe] reacted and created problems. We know that the game was dangerous it was about getting the third goal, but at the same time keeping the balance.</p>
      <p>“I think we performed well and I’m happy with the boys, because the first half should be our reference for how we want to proceed and to keep on growing and improving.”</p>
