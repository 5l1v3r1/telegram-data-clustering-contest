      <h1>Henry Slade continues Exeter’s promising start with Glasgow win</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/exeter">Exeter</a> have not previously found it complicated to exit Europe, but after starting the group stage with two victories that were both gilded with bonus points, they are looking not just to remain for the knockout stage but to enjoy home comforts after a second-half comeback when the Chiefs paid more than a passing resemblance to South Africa.</p>
      <p>Glasgow led 13-10 at half-time after scoring a try from a scrum conceded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/22/stuart-hogg-exeter-glasgow-european-champions-cup">their former full-back Stuart Hogg</a> who forgot his new surroundings after eight minutes when, fielding a long kick just outside his 22 in wet conditions, he decided to go off on an adventure and threw a pass out of the back of his hand that went forward.</p>
      <p>A minute later he was watching Nick Grigg score under the posts after Tommy Seymour had taken Adam Hastings’s inside pass and bounced off Tom O’Flaherty to create the try for the centre, who evaded Henry Slade’s challenge on his way to the line.</p>
      <p>Glasgow were prepared to run from everywhere but they did not score another try until the end when they were 21 points behind, having failed to apply pressure in the home side’s 22.</p>
      <p>Exeter have tended to be a wan imitation of themselves in Europe and even when they took the lead with a Jonny Hill try from a quickly taken penalty as Glasgow were assuming it would be kicked to touch and turned into a driving maul, there was a lack of thread running though their game and two Adam Hastings penalties following scrum offences restored the visitors’ lead.</p>
      <p>It took the interval for Exeter to grasp what was required. Most of the second half was played in Glasgow’s territory and mistakes squeezed from the Pro14 side, starting with the kick-off, following which Sam Johnson dropped a poor pass and Jack Nowell broke from a scrum to create a try for Slade.</p>
      <p>Glasgow made 141 passes to Exeter’s 89 and attempted to make 106 tackles compared to 174, but the Chiefs were where they needed to be after the break, in their opponents’ half, cramping their space and profiting from mistakes and wrong options which their pressure induced.</p>
      <p>After George Horne’s pass to Hastings missed the fly-half by some distance and rolled into the visitors’ 22, a penalty kicked to touch saw Sam Simmonds score from a driving maul and six minutes later, with Glasgow still unable to get out of their half, Nowell fielded a kick that lacked a chaser to stroll infield and start a passing movement that finished with Slade chipping to the line for O’Flaherty to profit from a bounce that took the ball away from the sweeping Peter Horne and secured the bonus point.</p>
      <p>A year ago, Exeter drew at home to Munster after failing to identify the path to victory and then lost here to Gloucester. “We have matured and grown in stature,” said their head coach, Rob Baxter. “We are taking nothing for granted because we have won our opening two games before, but we have given ourselves a fantastic foothold in the competition.”</p>
      <p>His Glasgow opposite number, Dave Rennie, said he was disappointed rather than dejected at a defeat that was partially due to his team’s inability to kick their way out of trouble. It was Exeter’s lack of a second dimension that used to undermine them in Europe.</p>
      <p>They still look to wear opponents down in the forwards and squeeze them into submission, but they have a springboard behind, and not just because of Hogg’s arrival: Slade and Nowell exploited space shrewdly and the Chiefs, who have a double‑header with Sale next month, are looking the real deal.</p>
