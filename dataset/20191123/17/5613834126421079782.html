      <p>The ’90s series <b><i>The Maxx</i></b> from Image Comics was turned into an animated series for MTV back in ’95, and up next it’s getting a brand new adaptation from producer <b>Channing Tatum</b>!</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/channing-tatum-roy-lee-adapt-sam-kieth-comic-maxx-1257352">THR reports</a> that Tatum and <b>Roy Lee</b> (<i>It</i>) are producing the adaptation of Sam Kieth’s comic series, though the site is unsure if it’ll be a movie or a new television series.</p>
      <blockquote>“The original series followed the adventures of The Maxx, who appears in both the real world and an alternate reality, the Outback.”</blockquote>
      <p>“In the real world, he is a homeless man living in a box but in the Outback, he is a powerful masked being who is the protector of the Jungle Queen. In the real world, the latter is a social worker named Julie Winters who frequently works to help the homeless man, unaware that the alternate reality exists and is exerting a dangerous influence on her life.”</p>
      <p>It sounds like this one is in the very early stages of development, with no writer(s) or director(s) attached at this time. Stay tuned for more as we learn it.</p>
