      <h1>'We won with dignity' - Bristol Rovers boss Graham Coughlan on action-packed win over Shrewsbury after simulation and bust-ups</h1>
      <h2>There was a lot to unpack from the high-octane clash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:47:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Graham Coughlan says Bristol Rovers won with dignity in their 4-3 victory over Shrewsbury Town.</p>
      <p>In an incredible game of football, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> won the game thanks to Abu Ogogo's last-gasp goal after they were initially pegged back from 3-1 up to 3-3.</p>
      <p>It was a feisty encounter but Ogogo chose not to celebrate his late winner having previously played for and captained the home side.</p>

      <p>Coughlan praised his midfielder for opting against celebrating when emotions were running high.</p>
      <p>He said: "That's his second away goal this season, he's had a number of opportunities this season and come close on several occasions.</p>
      <p>"We just try to encourage bodies in the box, we get good coverage in the box when the ball goes wide.</p>
      <p>"It was a nice touch that he chose not to celebrate as he played here, so we won with dignity."</p>
      <p>After Tony Craig put <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> 1-0 up, the game sparked into life when Louis Tompson went down under a tackle from Alfie Kilgour in the penalty box.</p>
      <p>When referee Graham Salisbury failed to point to the spot, a huge bust-up between both sets of players occurred, and set the tone for a bad-tempered, all-action game.</p>
      <p>Coughlan accused one of the Shrewsbury players of cowardice, claiming they raised their hands to a Rovers player.</p>
      <p>He said: "I wanted to go on the pitch, one of their players lifted his hands.</p>
      <p>"The referee, whether he chose to dismiss it or didn't see it, I wanted to go on the pitch.</p>
      <p>"I don't like cowardly acts."</p>
      <p>On the hotly-debated non-penalty, Coughlan backed the referee, but said he felt <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> were harshly done by themselves when Victor Adeboyejo had a goal ruled out.</p>
      <p>He said: "I thought the referee called it spot on, to be honest with you.</p>
      <p>"It was simulation, the referee is an experienced lad, he's not going to fall for things like that.</p>
      <p>"On the other hand, we should have been 3-0 up because there was nothing wrong with the goal we scored.</p>
      <p>"So, 3-0, although this is us we're talking about, the game might have been done.</p>
      <p>"On a day like today, the game was never going to be done until the referee blew the final whistle.</p>
      <p>"We were disappointed the third goal didn't stand, it's an error from the linesman."</p>
