      <h1>Girls Aloud stars deny 'plotting against Nadine Coyle on I'm A Celebrity'</h1>
      <h2>Tabloid claimed trio had voted for her to take part in Bushtucker trials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:31:58+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:31</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Girls Aloud stars Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts have insisted they are supporting former bandmate Nadine Coyle on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>, despite newspaper reports suggesting otherwise.</p>
      <p>It was claimed by one tabloid that the trio had formed a WhatsApp group chat about <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-are-making-the-same-joke-about-nadines-singing/">Nadine</a> - and had been "voting repeatedly" for her to take part in the Bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>However, Cheryl, Kimberley and Nicola have said they bear no malice towards their former Girls Aloud bandmate.</p>
      <p>The three singers - who along with Nadine and Sarah Harding made up the five-person band between 2002 and their split 2013 - were snapped out together in West London last night as they celebrated Kimberly's birthday.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Cheryl is reported to have told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html">MailOnline</a>: "We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.</p>
      <p>"We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!"</p>
      <p>Kimberley added: "I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there."</p>
      <p>Nicola also completely denied the existence of the alleged group chat and added they all hoped Nadine will do thrive on the ITV reality series down under.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Nadine gave a Girls Aloud favourite a bit of a jungle remix when she formed her own girl band with her fellow campmates.</p>
      <p>Nadine taught Caitlyn Jenner, Jacqueline Jossa and Adele Roberts the dance moves to 2008 single The Promise - with her on lyrics.</p>
      <p>And even though Caitlyn didn't know the song, that didn't stop her from joining in. Jacqueline later commented she loves how Caitlyn "throws herself" into activities.</p>
      <p>Nadine also joked that she's planning to teach Caitlyn some more routines in the future.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old said: "Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we'll teach her Sound of the Underground next."</p>
