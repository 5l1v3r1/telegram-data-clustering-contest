      <h1>Burnley’s Sean Dyche returns to old home to send Watford to the bottom</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:18:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ed-aarons" target="_blank">Ed Aarons</a></address>
      <p>This was not exactly what Quique Sánchez Flores had planned. Attempting to avoid the ignominy of becoming the first side in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/premier-league-best-and-worst-so-far-part-two">Watford</a>’s history to go 11 home league matches without a win, instead the Spaniard could only watch on in despair as rampant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/25/burnley-miracle-premier-league-success-story-poorest-owner">Burnley</a> scored three goals without reply in the second half to record their first away victory in the Premier League since April and move up to sixth.</p>
      <p>It left Watford’s manager back where he started, with Norwich’s victory at Everton condemning his side to bottom place in the league once again. Following Chris Wood’s smart finish just after half-time, Flores and – perhaps more pertinently, his employers – will be concerned to see how his side capitulated as Ashley Barnes and James Tarkowski rounded off hugely satisfying afternoon for his opposite number, Sean Dyche. “In the first half we were below par but we had a good reaction in the second half,” said the delighted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/burnley">Burnley</a> manager. “You have to stay in it to win it and we did. I don’t think it was a 3-0 performance but we will take it.”</p>
      <p>Watford’s last <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague">Premier League</a> victory at Vicarage Road came against Fulham a week before their FA Cup semi-final victory over Wolves in April. Much has changed in these parts since then, with the Javi Gracia era now a distant memory following his unceremonious dumping.</p>
      <p>Flores must have sensed an opportunity to follow up their first win of the season against opponents who had only picked up three points on the road so far this season. Burnley are anything but pushovers, of course, and, with Dyche returning to the club where he spent three years as a player before cutting his managerial teeth in Hertfordshire, they were in typically combative mood.</p>
      <p>From the moment Tarkowski ploughed into Will Hughes 10 minutes in, it was clear that the referee, Paul Tierney, would have his hands full to control a bad-tempered encounter. Gerard Deulofeu should have made Tarkowski pay after being caught in possession by the former Barcelona forward only for Nick Pope to come to Burnley’s produce an excellent save with his feet. When Deulofeu called the England goalkeeper into action again from a free-kick just before half-time, it seemed like only a matter of time until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/watford">Watford</a> would take the lead but Burnley had other plans. It all started to unravel for the hosts after Wood was first to react when Tarkowski’s header at the back post struck José Holebas and looped up in the air for the New Zealand striker to volley home.</p>
      <p>Flores responded by throwing on Troy Deeney for the captain’s first appearance since the defeat to Everton in August but it was Burnley who grew in confidence. Substitute Jay Rodriguez almost made the points safe after a long punt forward from Pope, only for his effort to come back off the crossbar. Barnes eventually slotted home the second from the spot after an intervention from VAR – only the third penalty Burnley have been awarded in their last 94 matches – following a foul on the striker just as Watford were preparing to take a corner at the other end. Tarkowski added a late third to heap the pressure on Flores, although he insisted afterwards that it could easily have been different.</p>
      <p>“One goal is big for us at the moment, going behind changed our mentality,” he said. “I am not worried about anything.” Given the track record of Watford’s owners, perhaps he should be.</p>
