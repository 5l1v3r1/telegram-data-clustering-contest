      <h1>Last rare Sumatran rhino in Malaysia dies after 'suffering significant pain'</h1>
      <h2>The Sumatran rhinoceros is the smallest species of rhino and now, after Iman's tragic death, only exists in tiny numbers, mostly in Indonesia and other parts of Asia</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:36:49+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:36</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>The last Sumatran <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rhinos">rhinoceros</a> in Malaysia died today - leaving the smallest species of rhino now surviving in tiny numbers in  Indonesia.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old animal, named Iman, began to suffer "significant pain" after falling unwell to cancer.</p>
      <p>She had been cared for in a wildlife reserve in the state of Sabah on the island of Borneo since her capture in 2014.</p>
      <p>"Iman's death came rather sooner than we had expected, but we knew that she was starting to suffer significant pain," said Augustine Tuuga, director of the Sabah Wildlife Department.</p>
      <p>The Sumatran rhino was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/science/sumatran-rhino-declared-extinct-wild-6295497">declared extinct in the wild in Malaysia</a> in 2015.</p>

      <p>The country's last male Sumatran rhino died in May this year.</p>
      <p>There are now thought to be less than 80 Sumatran rhino in the wild in Indonesia.</p>
      <p>Conservationists believe they mainly live on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and on the Indonesian side of Borneo.</p>
      <p>But habitat loss and poaching endangered them years ago.</p>
      <p>They rarely breed as a result, conservation group International Rhino Foundation says.</p>
      <p>Malaysia has, since 2011, tried to breed the species in captivity through in-vitro fertilization, but without success.</p>
      <p>When they were declared extinct in the wild in the nation in 2015, scientists predicted a grim outlook.</p>
      <p>Rasmus Gren Havmøller, from the Center for Macroecology, Evolution and Climate, said at the time: "It is vital for the survival of the species that all remaining Sumatran rhinos are viewed as a metapopulation, meaning that all are managed in a single program across national and international borders in order to maximize overall birth rate.</p>
      <p>"This includes the individuals currently held in captivity."</p>
