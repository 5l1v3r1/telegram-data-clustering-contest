      <h1>St Mirren 2 Ross County 1 as Sam Foley stunner takes Saints off the bottom - 3 talking points</h1>
      <h2>Sean McLoughlin also scored as Jim Goodwin's men leapfrogged St Johnstone and Hamilton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:28:07+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Kyle Gunn</a></address>
      <p>St Mirren fought back from a goal down to claim a vital three points against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ross-county-fc">Ross County</a> and move off the bottom of the table.</p>
      <p>Goals from Sean McLoughlin and late winner from Sam Foley sees Saints leapfrog St Johnstone for 24 hours at least after Brian Graham put County ahead.</p>
      <p>Goodwin’s men came into the game on the back a 5-2 defeat against Hearts at Tynecastle, which saw them propping up the league during the international break.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the Staggies, who stole an injury time winner when the teams met in Dingwall earlier this season, remain in sixth coming in to this one despite a 3-1 reverse against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> last time out.</p>
      <p>Lively beginning to proceedings in this one, the hosts forced a few early corners, that came to nothing, before Obika wasted two attempts.</p>
      <p>But it would be the visitors, who had looked promising on the break, that would take the lead after 24 minutes when a terrific Brian Graham finish flew by Vaclav Hladky.</p>

      <p>It could have been 2-0 minutes later had Hladky not pulled off a top drawer save deny Billy Mackay.</p>
      <p>That miss allowed Hull loanee McLoughlin to pounce for his first goal for the club on  43 minutes and the teams went in level at the break.</p>
      <p>It was a dominant start to the second half for Saints who had efforts Durmus and Obika who saw a powerful drive blocked.</p>
      <p>The most blatant chance would come with 17 minutes to go but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> winger Ilkay Durmus was free in the box but couldn’t connect with it after great work from Flynn.</p>
      <p>But that didn’t matter much because Foley smashed in his first Saints goal to give Goodwin’s men all three points after 87 minutes.</p>

      <h3>3 talking points</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Home sweet home as Buddies get off bottom spot</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s the first time in five weeks that St Mirren have stepped out at the Simple Digital Arena, and it remains the only place they have picked up any points this season. Today’s victory with goals from Sean McLoughlin and Sam Foley has rounded off a good week for boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jim-goodwin">Jim Goodwin</a> who saw his side get off bottom spot for at least 24 hours, having turned 38 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Staggies frustrated as they fall to Paisley defeat</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ross County, who were still in the top six coming into the fixture, haven’t actually won in the league since they beat Motherwell 2-1 at Fir Park on September 21. And Dingwall co-gaffers Stuart Kettlewell and Steven Ferguson will be racking their brains trying to find a way to get back to winning ways as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>First goal scorers do the business for Saints</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sean McLoughlin and Sam Foley both hit their first goals for St Mirren as they leapfrogged St Johnstone at the bottom who take on Aberdeen tomorrow. Foley’s late winner could prove vital as Jim Goodwin wants to take as many home points as possible and that’s even more important considering the Buddies are yet to take a single point on the road.</p>
