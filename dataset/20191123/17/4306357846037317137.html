      <h3>Gary Lineker has taken to social media to praise Liverpool FC’s resilience after they claimed a 2-1 win at Crystal Palace to continue their fine start to the new season.</h3>
      <p>The Reds headed into the game looking to make it 12 wins from 13 in the top flight and on the back of their 3-1 victory over Manchester City before the international break.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane gave the visitors the lead in the 49th minute at Selhurst Park with his 10th goal of the season.</p>
      <p>However, the home side looked to have earned a point when Wilfried Zaha netted in the 82nd minute to equalise for the Eagles.</p>
      <p>But it was Liverpool FC who had the final say, with Roberto Firmino scoring the all-important winner in the 85th minute as they claimed all three points to maintain their place at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>England legend Lineker was clearly impressed by Liverpool FC’s fighting spirit as they claimed all three points to underline their status as title favourites.</p>
      <p>Lineker wrote on <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1198281189418815488">Twitter</a> after Firmino’s equaliser: “Scruffiest of goals from Firmino makes it 2-1. This @LFC side certainly find a way to win.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are aiming to win the Premier League title this season after having finished second behind Manchester City last term.</p>
      <p>They will take on Napoli at home in the Champions League on Wednesday night, before preparing for their next Premier League game – a home clash against Brighton and Hove Albion next weekend.</p>
      <p>The Reds are yet to lose a game in the Premier League and have only dropped two points so far this season.</p>
