      <h3>Kelle Roos 6</h3>
      <p>Two or three shaky moments first half, and some second half, but a clean sheet - his fourth on the spin at home. Still not convincing when he has to come for the ball.</p>
      <h3>Jayden Bogle 7</h3>
      <p>Drove forward from right back, needs more care with end product.</p>
      <h3>Curtis Davies 7</h3>
      <p>Very steady from the skipper.</p>
      <h3>Craig Forsyth 8</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Showed all his experience in his first game for a year. Excellent comeback.</p>
      <h3>Max Lowe 7</h3>
      <p>Good display by the left back.</p>
      <h3>Graeme Shinnie 6</h3>

      <p>Started the game well, but limped off early on.</p>
      <h3>Krystian Bielik 8</h3>
      <p>Strong, controlled performance. Blossoming in midfield. Star man.</p>
      <h3>Duane Holmes 7</h3>

        <figcaption>Derby County Vs Preston North End<cite>(Image: Andy Clarke)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Lively, energetic, just that end product.</p>
      <h3>Mason Bennett 7</h3>
      <p>Strong start, driving runs, then injured.</p>
      <h3>Chris Martin 7.5</h3>

      <p>Link up play was very good.</p>
      <h3>Tom Lawrence 8</h3>
      <p>Lively, a constant threat.</p>
      <h4>SUBS: George Evans (for Shinnie, 15) 7</h4>
      <p>Settled into the midfield role after coming off the bench early on</p>
      <h4>Martyn Waghorn (for Bennett, 33) 7.5</h4>
      <p>Good display, scored the winner and could have had a hat trick</p>
      <h4>Andre Wisdom (for Martin, 78) N/A</h4>
