      <h1>A Michael Jackson Biopic Is in the Works</h1>
      <h2>From the producers of ‘Bohemian Rhapsody.’</h2>

      <p>A <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/michael-jackson">Michael Jackson</a> biopic is in the works from <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/bohemian-rhapsody"><i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i></a> producer Graham King. King and the Jackson estate struck a deal for the artist’s life and music rights in order to develop a feature film based on his life.</p>
      <p>Screenwriter John Logan (<a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/gladiator"><i>Gladiator</i></a>, <i>The Aviator</i>) will pen the script, and according to <i><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/michael-jackson-movie-bohemian-rhapsody-producer-john-logan-graham-king-1202792922/">Deadline</a></i>, will not serves as a “sanitized rendering of Jackson’s life.” The duo previously worked together on <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/martin-scorcese">Martin Scorsese</a>‘s <i>The Aviator </i>as well as his family film <i>Hugo</i>.</p>
      <p>The film comes off the heels of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/hbo">HBO</a>‘s recent Emmy-winning documentary <i>Leaving Neverland</i>, in which <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/michael-jackson-estate-concert-footage-release">the estate sued the network for $100 million USD</a> for airing it without their consent. Despite the lingering controversy surrounding the artist, there is still an <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/3/michael-jacksons-stream-numbers-drop">appetite for his music</a> and story. A Broadway musical called <i>MJ: The Musical</i> is also set to debut next year.</p>
