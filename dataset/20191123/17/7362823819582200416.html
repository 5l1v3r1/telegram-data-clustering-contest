      <h1>Southwest Airlines employee dancing while de-icing plane caught on video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:55:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A Southwest <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airlines">Airlines </a>employee was caught on video busting a move while de-icing a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/general/airports">plane, </a>and he completely steals the show.</p>
      <p>The video, shared by Claire Embil on Nov. 14, shows Southwest employee Davon Sims standing in a crane beside a grounded plane at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin">Milwaukee</a>’s Mitchell International Airport while apparently listening to music.</p>
      <p>“Idk who this man is but he made a delayed flight so much better! It’s the little things,” tweeted Embil, who told the<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/11/22/southwest-airlines-worker-dances-while-de-icing-plane-goes-viral/4269109002/"> Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a> that she had never been on a plane while de-icing was happening.</p>

      <p>"He was in his own world in between the sprays just jamming out. I couldn't help but take a video," Embil said.</p>
      <p>Sims, who has worked for Southwest for nearly seven years, said he was probably listening to a ‘90s R&amp;B song at the time. Dancing, he said, is a part of his usual work routine.</p>
      <p>"Usually I’m out there at 4 in the morning, so either I'm listening to music or I have a song stuck in my head and I'm moving to stay warm," he said.</p>

      <p>The video has garnered positive reactions online after being picked up by a few news outlets.</p>
      <p>"I find it's pretty cool," Sims said. "With a lot of things going on in the world, someone recognized me and they were having a rough day with their flight being delayed and that day was made better by me."</p>
