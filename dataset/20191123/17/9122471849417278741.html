      <h1>Cris Collinsworth Predicts How Much QB Dak Prescott Will Get Paid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:53:40+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Dak Prescott has been in the thick of new contract discussions this season. The fourth-year quarterback is on the final year of his rookie contract and is in line for a major payday.</p>
      <p>Many expected the new contract to be arranged by now, but it appears the Cowboys will wait this one out, potentially until the end of the season. But is that the right move? Does Prescott deserve to be paid now? NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth thinks so.</p>
      <p>Collinsworth spent some time on the Dan Patrick Show to discuss Prescott. He also shared some insight on how much he predicts the Cowboys quarterback will get paid.</p>
      <blockquote>“Dak Prescott, here in the last few weeks, has just been that other guy,” Collinsworth said, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Dak-Prescott-Dallas-Cowboys-Jerry-Jones-contract-extension-Cris-Collinsworth-139042982/">247Sports</a>. “He’s the one that you’d say, if you’re his agent, this is a dream scenario right now … To me right now, the Cowboys are going to be lucky to get him for $40 million a year.”</blockquote>
      <p>If Prescott were to strike a $40 million per year deal, that would make him the highest paid quarterback in the NFL. Is he worth that money?</p>
      <p>Dallas is 6-4, good for first place in the NFC East Division. Prescott continues to improve and is showing flashes of brilliance each week.</p>
      <p>It’ll be interesting to see how Prescott and the Cowboys handle contract negotiations moving forward.</p>
