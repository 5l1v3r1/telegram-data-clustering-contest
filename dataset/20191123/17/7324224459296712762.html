      <p>In a fiery Championship encounter at The Hawthorns, Hal Robson-Kanu's fourth goal in six matches put the Baggies ahead.</p>
      <p>They were pegged back after the interval when Steven Fletcher scored from the penalty spot after FIlip Krovinovic had fouled Kieran Lee in the box.</p>
      <p>From that point the game could have gone either way with Slaven Bilic's side not at their free-flowing best.</p>
      <p>But in the 88th minute they were awarded a penalty of their own when Matheus Pereira was fouled in the box by Kieran Westwoon.</p>
      <p>And substitute Austin then made no mistake from 12-yards with the forward emphatically finding the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>That strike was enough to win it for the Baggies and keep them top of the Championship.</p>
      <p>But the drama was still not over with Wednesday's Liam Palmer sent off in stoppage time for a late challenge on Grady Diangana.</p>
      <h3>Report</h3>
      <p>Before kick-off, all the talk was focused on who Bilic would play in central midfield with both Jake Livermore and Romaine Sawyers suspended.</p>
      <p>And it was Semi Ajayi and Filip Krovinovic who got the nod - with Ahmed Hegazi coming in at centre-back to allow the Nigerian to step into midfield.</p>
      <p>Those tweaks meant the Baggies were able to continue in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with Hal Robson-Kanu the lone striker, Matheus Pereira in the number 10 role and Matt Phillips and Grady Diangana out wide.</p>
      <p>Sheffield Wednesday lined up in a 4-5-1 system with ex-Albion loanee Jacob Murphy on the right-wing. Kadeem Harris was on the left with Steve Fletcher up front.</p>
      <p>In what proved to be a bizarre opening 10 minutes, Albion looked uncharacteristically shaky at the back with the visitors creating two decent chances to open the scoring.</p>
      <p>First Hegazi failed to judge the flight of a long punt forward with Murphy nipping in to win the ball before hitting the byline.</p>
      <p>The winger then sent in an inviting low cross which Fletcher was just millimetres away from tapping in.</p>
      <p>Then just a few moments later, a corner fell kindly for Julian Borner who lashed a strike at goal from six-yards.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Albion, the effort took a deflection and sailed wide for a corner.</p>
      <p>Going forward, though, Bilic's side had also had their moments.</p>
      <p>And they then went on to open the scoring when Pereira's wonderful through-ball sent Robson-Kanu galloping through on goal.</p>
      <p>The Welshman still had a lot to do.</p>
      <p>But full of confidence he carried the ball into the box before calmly rolling it past Kieren Westwood and into the net.</p>
      <p>Wednesday had come with a game plan to sit back and try and hit Albion on the break.</p>
      <p>But while the clash calmed down somewhat after the goal it remained on a knife-edge with the Baggies looking to move the ball through the thirds - while Monk's side tried to counter through the pacy Harris and Murphy.</p>
      <p>It was Bilic's side who were looking the more dangerous, though, with the hosts dominating possession and getting into dangerous areas.</p>
      <p>But they were often stopped in their tracks by a physical Wednesday side - with Diangana and Pereira, in particular, coming on for some rough treatment.</p>
      <p>And with the game stop-start, it petered out to half-time with Albion deservedly ahead but with Wednesday's game plan meaning they were still very much in the game at the break.</p>
      <p>Monk's side came out and played with more intensity following the re-start - with the visitors seeming to want the ball more.</p>
      <p>And they got themselves back on terms just before the hour-mark after they were gifted a penalty when Krovinovic overplayed on the edge of his own box.</p>
      <p>That allowed Lee to nip in and win the ball with the Croatian then bringing him down in the box.</p>
      <p>Referee Tony Harrington immediately pointed to the spot - with Fletcher converting from 12-yards.</p>
      <p>Albion responded straight away with Darnell Furlong whipping in a dangerous cross which Robson-Kanu prodded wide.</p>
      <p>Wednesday, though, were now on top with Monk's side having two excellent opportunities to take the lead.</p>
      <p>First, a free-kick from the left was met by Morgan Fox whose volley clipped the top of the crossbar as it sailed over.</p>
      <p>Hegazi then dallied on the ball in the box before passing straight to a Wednesday player.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian then made up for the error by making an excellent block to keep out a strike from Lee.</p>
      <p>With Wednesday on top, Bilic made a double change with Garth Barry and Austin replacing Hegazi and Robson-Kanu. Then shortly after Chris Brunt replaced Krovinovic.</p>
      <p>And as the clock ticked towards the 90 minute mark, Albion won it with a mad 60 seconds of football.</p>
      <p>First Diangana whipped in a cross that was met by Austin.</p>
      <p>The striker's header looked destined to nestle into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>But it clipped the post and sailed wide.</p>
      <p>Undeterred, Bilic's side continued to press and they won a penalty of their own in the 88th minute when Pereira raced into the box only to be clattered by Westwood.</p>
      <p>Referee Harrington again pointed to the spot with Austin burying the ball in the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>But while that was enough to earn the Baggies all three points, the drama was not over with Palmer sent off in stoppage time for a reckless challenge on Diangana.</p>
