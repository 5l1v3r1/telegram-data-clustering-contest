      <h1>New BMW 5 Series Spied With M Sport Body Kit</h1>
      <h2>Don’t worry, it won’t have a gigantic kidney grille.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:20:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>The current <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/5-series">BMW 5 Series</a> has only been on sale since 2017, but BMW is already preparing the popular sedan for a mid-cycle facelift. While we've seen numerous <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/the-bmw-5-series-is-ready-for-a-refresh">camouflaged prototypes being tested</a>, this one has been spiced up.</p>
      <p>For the first time, the updated BMW 5 Series has been spotted with the optional M Sport Package, which adds an aerodynamic body kit and sport suspension that lowers the sedan closer to the ground. For the current 5 Series, the M Sport Package is available for an extra $5,000 for the 530i and $3,550 for the 540i.</p>

      <p>Mercifully, the kidney grille doesn't appear to be much larger than the one on the current model. In contrast, the new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/m3">M3</a>, M4, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/4-series">4 Series</a> will get new gigantic grilles inspired by the controversial <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/say-hello-to-the-bmw-concept-4-a-new-look-for-the-brand">BMW Concept 4</a> to give these models a bolder design. We also get a clearer look at the redesigned front bumper, which has a larger lower grille and bigger air intakes. Other changes include slimmer headlights, a redesigned rear bumper, and new rear lights that freshen up the design.</p>
      <p>Inside, the cabin isn't expected to receive any major changes apart from updates to the digital cluster and a larger infotainment screen with updated software.</p>

      <p>Engine options are likely to carry over, so expect the refreshed 530i to have a 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produces 248 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque and the 540i to pack a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six producing 335 hp and 331 lb-ft. The M550i will use a turbocharged V8 delivering 523 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque. Power will be sent through an eight-speed automatic transmission.</p>
      <p>Previous spy shots have also shown there will be a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/updated-bmw-5-series-is-hiding-some-powerful-hybrid-tech">new hybrid 545e xDrive model</a> that's expected to use a detuned version of the plug-in hybrid drivetrain found in the 745e xDrive iPerformance detuned to around 375 hp. The BMW 5 Series facelift is expected to arrive in late 2020 or possibly early 2021.</p>
