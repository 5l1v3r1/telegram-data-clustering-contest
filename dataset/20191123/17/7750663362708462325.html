      <p>As a result of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/granit-xhaka/"><b>Granit Xhaka</b></a> being stripped of the skipper's armband, Aubameyang has now taken on extra responsibility both on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>Despite only being in the role for a number of weeks, the Gabon international has admitted that he is eager to display the same attributes as some of the club's legends.</p>
      <p>In Arsenal's official matchday programme, the forward said: "Arsenal has a great history of wonderful captains like Patrick Vieira and Tony Adams.</p>
      <p>"It is a privilege to follow in their footsteps and I will honour the armband by doing my very best on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>"When I was younger, I remember always wanting to be captain in my youth teams. I was talking about it with my mum just the other day actually. We were laughing because we recalled how I used to buy armbands myself so I could wear them."</p>
      <p>While Aubameyang has established himself as a leader in the dressing room, reports have suggested that the 30-year-old is <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/transfer-talk/news/aubameyang-postpones-arsenal-contract-talks_380081.html">currently unwilling to pen a new contract.</a></p>
