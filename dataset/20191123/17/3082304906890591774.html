        <b>A pulsating tie went the way of Canada, who defeated Russia to ensure they will contest the Davis Cup final for the first time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canada won a thrilling tie against Russia to seal a place in the Davis Cup final for the first time on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Russia prevailed in a deciding doubles tie-break in an epic contest with Serbia a day earlier but were unable to repeat the trick as Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil made history for Canada.</p>
      <p>The duo secured a 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-5) triumph over Andrey Rublev and Karen Khachanov in Madrid, despite Pospisil having received treatment on a shoulder injury prior to the final set.</p>
      <p>It marked the culmination of a memorable tussle, in which Russia struck first when Rublev earned a fourth singles victory of the week with a 6-4 6-4 win over Pospisil.</p>

      <p>That meant Shapovalov had to defeat Khachanov to keep Canada’s hopes alive and things were not looking good when the Russian raced into a 4-1 lead.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov rallied brilliantly to take the opener, but succumbed when serving to stay in the second at 5-4 down.</p>
      <p>A tense decider went the way of Shapovalov, who celebrated a 6-4 4-6 6-4 victory in a match featuring 73 unforced errors.</p>
      <p>Spain or Great Britain, who contest the other last-four tie, await in the final.</p>
