        <li>The date of Nov. 22 is a “big deal” for the company.</li>
        <li>Reading between the lines – is Project Scarlett arriving on Nov. 22, 2020?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here’s a bit of light weekend speculation for you. Microsoft’s Xbox team may have given us the biggest hint yet about the launch date of the next-generation Project Scarlett – Nov. 22, 2020.</p>
      <p>The official Xbox Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1197922807511834624">authored a tweet late yesterday to celebrate the anniversary of both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles</a>. These were released fourteen and six years ago yesterday, respectively.</p>

      <h3>Will Project Scarlett Launch on Nov. 22 Next Year?</h3>
      <p>The tweet emphasizes that the date of Nov. 22 is a “big deal” for the company, which leads us to speculate that Microsoft could stick to the established pattern of dropping new consoles on that date.</p>
      <p>The official stance from Xbox is that Project Scarlett will land during the 2020 holiday season. Nov. 22 falls smack dab into the middle of that window, further adding weight to the notion that yesterday’s tweet was a not so subtle hint.</p>

      <p>It’s worth saying this isn’t an explicit confirmation, but there’s a sense Microsoft wants us to read between the lines. The tweet isn’t penned in the past tense, but in the present, implying the date is currently a “big deal” <i>because</i> of Project Scarlett.</p>
      <h3>Jumping the Gun on Xbox’s Biggest Day</h3>
      <p>We’ll admit that anticipation may have gotten the better of us with all this. We can’t discount that the tweet is what it appears to be – a celebration of previous generational iterations of the console. In that case, a happy anniversary to Xbox.</p>
      <p>Either way, the 12 months between now and the 2020 holiday season will invariably provide a firm answer to the question of when Project Scarlett will arrive. We’ll also finally get a proper name and <a href="https://www.ccn.com/microsoft-just-gave-a-big-tease-about-xbox-project-scarlett-price/">a firm price point</a>.</p>
