      <p>Plymouth Argyle made it four wins in their last five League Two games as they beat Bradford City 2-1 at Home Park.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">Ryan Lowe’s Pilgrims</a> are up to eighth in the table, only a point outside the play-off positions, after an excellent victory in an exciting match.</p>
      <p>Striker Byron Moore and midfielder Joe Edwards scored first half goals for Argyle, who could easily have been more than 2-0 up at the interval.</p>
      <p>However, Bradford were much improved at the start of the second period after a double substitution by manager Gary Bowyer.</p>
      <p>Their pressure was rewarded as Argyle defender Niall Canavan conceded an own goal in the 51st minute.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims then showed good character to dig deep and come back into the contest as they limited the opportunities for a Bradford equaliser.</p>
      <p>Argyle man-of-the-match Antoni Sarcevic almost grabbed a late goal which would have made the five minutes of stoppage time much more comfortable for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the Pilgrims held onto their slender lead despite late pressure from City.</p>
      <p>Argyle had not played a league game at Home Park since they beat Leyton Orient 4-0 on October 22.</p>
      <p>After such a long wait, it did not take them long to got the opening goal against Bradford.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic made a strong run down the right and showed good determination to cut inside the challenge of Bradford’s Harry Pritchard.</p>
      <p>He then rolled the ball across to Moore, whose first attempt to put it into the net was blocked by ‘keeper Richard O’Donnell.</p>

      <p>However, Moore was alert to the rebound and applied the finishing touch at the secod time of trying.</p>
      <p>Bradford responded well to falling behind and had three decent chances to draw level, the first when Harry Pritchard headed over the bar after a Connor Wood cross.</p>
      <p>Callum Cooke sent a powerful 25-yard strike narrowly wide of Alex Palmer’s right post before Pritchard’s forced a diving save out of the Argyle ‘keeper.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims then doubled their lead in the 25th minute thanks to the tenacity and finishing ability of Edwards.</p>
      <p>O’Donnell was put under pressure by Edwards when he went to clear the ball from inside the Bradford penalty area.</p>
      <p>It went only as far as Joel Grant, who moved forward with it before passing inside to Edwards, who had taken up position next to him.</p>
      <p>Edwards then came up with a well-placed low left-foot finish to give O’Donnell no chance of making a save.</p>
      <p>It could have been 3-0 to the Pilgrims in the 35th minute when Grant showed good strength to win the ball off Bradford defender Ben Richards-Everton in a tackle.</p>
      <p>Grant raced towards goal and cut inside the attempted sliding block of former Pilgrims’ defender Anthony O’Connor.</p>
      <p>Having done all the hard work, Grant could come up with the finish though as his weak shot was stopped by O’Donnell.</p>
      <p>The Bradford ‘keeper also kicked away a deflected shot from Sarcevic on the stroke of half-time as Argyle were again denied a third goal.</p>
      <p>Bowyer made a double substitution at the start of the second half, with former Pilgrims’ defender Kelvin Mellor one of those sent on.</p>

      <p>The visitors showed much more urgency and were given a lifeline back into the match in the 51st minute.</p>
      <p>After Argyle could not clear a free-kick into their penalty area, Mellor touched the ball outside to O’Connor.</p>
      <p>Canavan tried to cut out O’Connor’s cross-shot but could only redirect it into his own goal, past Palmer.</p>
      <p>Bradford’s other half-time substitute, Zeli Ismail, almost came up with an equaliser in the 65th minute.</p>
      <p>Ismail made a run in between Argyle defenders Scott Wootton and Gary Sawyer and flicked the ball narrowly wide of Palmer’s right post.</p>
      <p>Canavan then had the chance to make amends for his earlier own goal with a clearcut scoring chance in the 73rd minute.</p>
      <p>The defender rose well at the far post to meet a cross from Edwards but sent his header wide of the target from close range.</p>
      <p>With Dom Telford now on as a substitute after replacing Moore, Argyle found a renewed lease of energy.</p>
      <p>Sarcevic almost put them 3-1 up in the 84th minute with a low shot which was blocked on the line by a combination of O’Donnell and Wood after a run and cross from Callum McFadzean.</p>
      <p>Inevitably, Argyle came under late pressure from Bradford but just about managed to deal with a couple of long throw-ins from Mellor deep into stoppage time in a tense finale.</p>
