      <h3>ICE POWERS</h3>

        <img src="https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/frozen2-trailer1.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>In between the events of the first <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/frozen/">Frozen</a></i> and <i>Frozen 2</i>, Elsa has essentially gained most of the abilities that Iceman possesses over in the X-Men corner of the Marvel Universe. In the previous film, she was shown creating ice creatures with a semblance of sentience and using her ice powers to shoot freezing blasts or create structures. She does both these things in <i>Frozen 2</i>, although with a greater sense of expertise than in the previous film.</p>
      <p>It's been three years since the conclusion of the first movie and Elsa has clearly been practicing ever since. Her ice blasts are more precise when she needs them to be, or larger and more powerful if the situation calls for it. She casually creates ice structures and tools for the group to use with ease.</p>
      <p>She also showcases some new powers over the course of the film: she constantly ices up the ground to increase the speed by which the group can move; she uses ice shields that look like massive snowflakes when she is attacked by the water elemental, and her body even seems to be fusing with the ice as the film progresses and she gets closer to the source of magical power, taking off her jacket and revealing a layer of ice across her body. It all builds to her discovering even more potent abilities that have multiple uses.</p>
      <h3>WATER HAS MEMORY</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/frozen-2-elsa.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>

      <p>One of Elsa's most useful powers ends up having no real use in combat, but it gives her the ability to learn secrets long since past. Olaf explains to the group that "water has memories." Because of this, the water in the atmosphere can take various forms of things that existed in the past. Elsa can then use her powers to freeze the water as it was during that point, allowing her to essentially recreate memories in the real world.</p>
      <p>This benefits Elsa and Anna repeatedly through the film and opens the past for them to learn the truth about their family history. It's through these ice statues that they learn about how their mother was the mysterious elemental force that saved their father in their childhood. It also illustrates the final moments of their parents as their ship went down in the ocean, apparently confirming that despite her magical powers, their mother wasn't able to save their father (and herself) as second time.</p>
      <p>It's also how Elsa and Anna discover the truth about how their grandfather built a massive dam to control and contain magic and even began the battle against the natives of the north. This information clues Anna into what she needs to do to free the world and helps lead to the heroes freeing and restoring magic.</p>

      <h3>ELSA IS AN ELEMENTAL</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/frozen-2-header.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=963&amp;h=481&amp;dpr=1.5"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The film's plot is jumpstarted by Elsa accidentally awakening the almost uncontrollable elemental spirits. This forces her to make her way through the Enchanted Forest, trying to learn more about her own powers and those of the elements. Over the course of the film, she struggles to win over the elements. She is able to use her powers to slow down the air elemental (a strong and seemingly sentient breeze that is aptly named "Gale" by the group) and the fire elemental (a salamander that causes fires anywhere he goes). Both of them end up helping Elsa on her quest.</p>
      <p>The trickest of the elemental spirits for her to win over proves to be the water elemental, Nokk. A stallion made of water, Nokk is initially aggressive to Elsa. It even tries to drown her during their first encounter. But Elsa is able to use her powers and survive the attack. She then uses them to create a harness for her to wrap around the horse, giving her an edge of control over it. She's able to tame it and ride the spirit across the ocean while creating an icy ground beneath it that can it can use to run across. Nokk even helps Elsa save Arendelle in the end.</p>
      <p>The film ends with the water elemental -- along with the earth elements known as the Rock Giants -- living beside Elsa, showing that she's made a life for herself in the wild, which seems to respect her as an equal. Elsa could end up calling upon these forces of nature for help to use the rest of the unnamed elements of the world, which would make her arguably one of the most powerful Disney characters ever.</p>
