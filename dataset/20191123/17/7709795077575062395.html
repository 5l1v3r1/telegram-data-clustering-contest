        <b>Ed Chamberlin reflects on a superb Saturday of action as Cyrname beat Altior at Ascot while Lostintranslation sparked emotional scenes after winning the Betfair Chase at Haydock.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Often we build up to a big clash and it fails to live up to expectations.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Cyrname v Altior delivered in spades in the Christy 1965 Chase at Ascot. It was compelling from the off and we were treated to a real horse race between two wonderful animals.</p>
      <p>A mighty gamble on Altior was foiled – he was sent off the 1/3 favourite – by an awesome front-running display from Cyrname, the lord of the manor at the Berkshire circuit.</p>
      <p>When they turned into the straight we were all set. It was a case of may the best horse win. And the best horse won, make no mistake about that.</p>
      <p>I don’t think it was stamina that beat Altior. I’m sure he’ll come on for the run, but so could Cyrname. Altior was simply beaten by a very good horse, the better horse on the day.</p>
      <p>Of course, once again, you have to take your hat off to Paul Nicholls.</p>
      <p>He is a born winner and several punters doubted this horse’s first-time-out record, but Nicholls clearly targeted this race some months ago knowing what could be at stake.</p>
      <p>The first horse to beat Altior over jumps. Nicholls’ Cyrname. He’ll love that. The pair of them have made a statement, big style, and you can absolutely see why he’s the 9/4 favourite with Sky Bet for the King George now.</p>
      <p>It’s shaping up to be an epic Christmas treat at Kempton.</p>

      <p>We were at Haydock on Saturday for ITV and saw a King George candidate ourselves thanks to the brilliant Lostintranslation, 3/1 with Sky Bet for the Kempton highlight, after beating Bristol De Mai in his own backyard with a sensational performance.</p>
      <p>This was a stunning ride from Robbie Power and it sparked emotional scenes in the winners’ enclosure afterwards.</p>
      <p>I absolutely love bringing human stories to the fore on ITV and the Taylor family, who own Lostintranslation along with Richard Dwyer, have been through such a tragedy after losing their young son, Charlie, three years ago.</p>
      <p>Ross Doyle and the late Willie Codd were instructed to get a horse to cheer the family up when this little boy died. The ultimate dream was to get a Gold Cup horse and now that dream is becoming a reality.</p>
      <p>Charlie’s favourite film was the Minions, hence the yellow colours, and there were tears galore in the Haydock winners’ enclosure.</p>
      <p>This sport and these horses can be so special at times.</p>
      <p>Earlier on, Stoney Mountain won for Henry Daly and our thoughts immediately turned to Helen Brisland, who used to look after him, who was paralysed after a fall which resulted in her rupturing her spinal cord.</p>
      <p>She’ll have loved seeing this big stamp of a horse rattle home for victory in the big handicap hurdle at Haydock, and he looks like a future chaser in the mould of those Daly’s predecessor Captain Tim Forster used to train.</p>
      <p>Perhaps he’ll be the one saying ‘just keep remounting’ in the future, something the pessimistic Captain Forster said to jockey Hywel Davis before Last Suspect landed the 1985 Grand National!</p>
