      <p>Portuguese ace Moutinho's sublime set-piece opened the scoring in the 21st minute with Jimenez netting his 14th of the term just after the half-hour mark.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth lost Simon Francis to a second yellow card in the 37th minute but Eddie Howe's men came out fighting in the second 45.</p>
      <p>After Diogo Jota saw his effort controversially ruled out by the offside flag Steve Cook popped up at the other end to set up a tense finish.</p>
      <p>But Wolves held on to a deserved three points as they made it eight without defeat in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>MATCH REPORT</p>
      <p>Wolves boss Nuno Espirito Santo named an unchanged side for this trip to Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>Jimenez, Romain Saiss, Leander Dendoncker, Matt Doherty, Ruben Neves, Moutinho, and Diogo Jota all returned from international duty unscathed to start this Premier League game.</p>
      <p>Adama Traore withdrew from the Spain squad and spent the break recovering from a knock he picked up in the 2-1 victory over Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>But after that rest and a new haircut, he was fit enough to take his place on the right of the front three.</p>
      <p>Ryan Bennett was rested as Nuno continues to manage his groin with Bournemouth bringing veteran defender Simon Francis into their side in place of injured attacker Joshua King.</p>
      <p>That move by Eddie Howe saw Bournemouth shift to a back three to mirror Nuno's favoured set-up.</p>
      <p>But there would be no stopping Traore, who picked up where he left off against Villa by rampaging down the right-wing to win an early corner for Wolves.</p>
      <p>Neves, fresh from netting against Villa, got his eye in early from the subsequent set-piece.</p>
      <p>But the Portuguese midfielder's volley flew off target.</p>
      <p>Up the other end Saiss went into the book early doors for a challenge on Lewis Cook.</p>
      <p>That was his fifth league yellow card of the season and he will now be suspended for the Sheffield United clash.</p>
      <p>Howe had attempted to stop Wolves' impressive wing-play with his altered formation.</p>
      <p>But Traore still found ways through on that right flank with Jonny diverting a cross into the path of Moutinho.</p>
      <p>He rifled the ball just past the left stick, though it would not be long before he followed Neves in ending a goal drought.</p>
      <p>Conor Coady made a number of crunching challenges and vital interceptions at the back to thwart Bournemouth.</p>
      <p>While Nathan Ake found himself in the book for clipping Wolves' danger-man Traore as he used his lightning-quick pace to ask questions of the opposition.</p>
      <p>But the goal Wolves' first-half play deserved would come from the opposite flank.</p>
      <p>Jota was chopped down by Francis just outside the box.</p>
      <p>The sliding, late challenge sent the forward flying, but after he had picked himself up, Moutinho took centre stage.</p>
      <p>The midfielder opted to go for goal instead of crossing the ball in and Ramsdale was left flapping at fresh air as his set-piece sailed into the top corner.</p>
      <p>It was his first goal since the 1-1 draw with Manchester United in September 2018 and the strike was a sublime way to end that wait.</p>
      <p>And he was instrumental in the second as Bournemouth failed to learn from the mistakes of the first goal.</p>
      <p>Traore was once again upended on that right-wing, this time Diego Rico the guilty party.</p>
      <p>Rico might have escaped without a booking but Bournemouth would not survive another set-piece.</p>
      <p>Moutinho slid the ball down straight down the wing to release Traore.</p>
      <p>He fired the ball into the box and Jimenez was on hand to sweep home.</p>
      <p>.Jimenez and Doherty had chances to increase the lead but as Bournemouth just kept Wolves at bay, their own man Francis would leave them with a mightier battle.</p>
      <p>The experienced centre-half pulled Jota back in the 37th minute to pick up his second yellow card.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth had already struggled to cope with Wolves and that change saw an enforced shift to a 4-4-1.</p>
      <p>It felt like game, set and match at the break but Howe's side refused to go down without a fight.</p>
      <p>Wolves had outclassed the Cherries in the first 45 but the hosts showed grit and determination to find a way to counter-act Wolves' one-touch master-class of the first half.</p>
      <p>And despite the man disadvantage, they returned from the break refreshed and determined.</p>
      <p>It would be Wolves who managed to get the ball in the net once again, Jota saw his goal controversially chalked off.</p>
      <p>Jimenez was ruled to have returned from an offside position before releasing Jota, referee Hooper blowing his whistle before the strike rippled the back of the net.</p>
      <p>It did not seem like that decision would have an impact on the game, but Bournemouth, already rallied by their bright start, saw the pendulum of momentum swing in their direction.</p>
      <p>Wolves had looked comfortable but they seized on the dismay from that disallowed effort and continued to press.</p>
      <p>They soon got their reward for their second-half play as Steve Cook glanced home Rico's corner in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>But it was still Wolves' game to lose as Nuno's men continued to create.</p>
      <p>Jimenez nodded the ball past the right stick and Traore sent the ball fizzing across the face of goal.</p>
      <p>Jota should have wrapped the game up when he was sent steaming through on goal by Moutinho.</p>
      <p>Moutinho had picked up the loose ball after Coady had emphatically cleared a corner.</p>
      <p>But his fellow countryman Jota could only sting the palms of Ramsdale as his strike was pushed out for a set-piece.</p>
      <p>Wolves once again failed to use a corner with Bournemouth dealing with that dead ball situation.</p>
      <p>And they nearly paid the price up the other end for wasted opportunities as Rui Patricio was forced into action.</p>
      <p>The shot-stopper pulled off a fine instinctive stop to bat away Ake's acrobatic effort and then Arnaut Danjuma blasted the ball wide as Bournemouth piled on the pressure in added time.</p>
      <p>But Wolves held on to pick up a deserved three points on the South coast - though after that sparkling first half, it should have been a much easier affair in that second half.</p>
      <p>Key Moments</p>
      <p>21 - GOOOAAALLLLL!!! Wolves are ahead thanks to a superb free-kick from Moutinho! Francis wipes out Jota just outside the box, and Moutinho, from an acute angle, expertly picks out the top corner. A stroke of genius from the midfielder.</p>
      <p>32 - GOOOOOAAAALL!!!! The visitors are running riot, and they grab a second! Moutinho cleverly releases Traore from a free-kick, and the Spaniard squares it across goal, leaving Jimenez with a simple tap-in. Sublime passage of play. Bournemouth stunned.37 - RED CARD! Francis is off for the Cherries! After taking down Jota, and getting booked, for the free-kick which Moutinho scored from, the home skipper gets another yellow - for clearly pulling Jota's shirt. Early shower.59 - Goal! Steve Cook pulls one back for the Cherries. The defender gets to the ball ahead of Traore from a corner, with his header looping past Patricio. The hosts, although a man down, have hope.</p>
      <p>82 - Almost a leveller for Bournemouth! A ball into the box falls kindly for Ake, who connects well on the volley. Fortunately, Patricio stands tall and palms the powerful effort away. Crucial save from the Portuguese.</p>
