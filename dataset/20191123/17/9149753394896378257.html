      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:29:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/pcgamer/" target="_blank">PCGamer</a></address>
      <p>There's no question that November brings us maybe the best collection of cheap gaming laptop deals of the year thanks to Black Friday later this month kickstarting the holiday season. Thankfully, you don't have to wait until after Thanksgiving to start seeing early pre-Black Friday gaming deals. </p>
      <p>Don't be surprised if some of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-laptop/">best gaming laptops</a> make it on to the list each week. With newer Nvidia RTX cards hitting the market, you'll find cheap gaming laptops deals on units with older GTX cards getting some pretty deep discounts. Keep in mind, that if you want to see fancy ray-tracing tech in action, you'll have to stick with RTX. Budget conscience gamers should take advantage of seeing systems with GTX cards. If you're in the market for something a little fancier, we found some deals on laptops with RTX 2070s if you've got a bigger budget. We got a little something for everyone. </p>
      <p>Recently, we've been finding a lot of deals on cheap budget gaming laptops in the $500-$1000 price range which is great for the student gamer on a budget who needs something to play League of Legends or Fortnite and oh, do homework, I guess. </p>

      <p>Slim and beautiful<br/>Battery lasts ages<br/>Very powerful<br/>Doesn't have G-sync</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a gaming laptop that combines elegant design, power, and portability, then the newly redesigned <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/msi-gs-series-stealth-15-6-gaming-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660ti-512gb-ssd-matte-black-with-gold-diamond-cut/6343295.p?skuId=6343295">MSI GS65 Stealth</a> is an absolute winner. It's thin and light enough to be used as both a working notebook and a relatively powerful gaming PC, and thanks to some smart design, it's actually slightly smaller than most 15" laptops, while offering the same amount of screen real-estate. The redesign improves upon an excellent foundation with a hardware refresh (including a 9th Gen processor and Nvidia's Pascal-architecture-in-a-GTX 1660 Ti) and an improved touchpad. </p>
      <p>That performance isn't wasted. The Stealth packs a 144Hz display, a great panel to pair with the new CPU and GPU. It's also got a speedy and relatively capacious (by solid state standards) SSD drive, which helps speed up boot times and shave a few seconds off in-game loads. There's also the now industry standard 16GB helping of DDR4 at 2666Mhz, plenty of RAM for the current bumper crop of triple-A extravaganzas.</p>
      <p>The battery life is very impressive too at 87Whr, and there are some lovely flourishes, like an RGB-capable Steelseries keyboard, a powerful webcam, and the aforementioned silky smooth glass touchpad. It's a perfect hybrid machine for gaming or work, and one of the most elegant looking laptops we've gotten our hands on.</p>

      <p>Very solid design<br/>Incredibly thin and easy to carry<br/>Powerful and elegant<br/>Lost the thinnest and lightest crowd</p>
      <p>With Razer you know what you're getting: a quality product, made with gamers in mind above all else. The new refresh of the Razer Blade 15 Advanced Model is the epitome of this thinking, with everything tailored specifically for gaming use. At the top of the heap of impressive stats is the 2080 Max-Q GPU, the slim version of Nvidia's ray tracing powerhouse. In terms of raw power, this iteration of the Blade 15 is extremely well specced, though the price you pay for that performance nudges it just slightly out of the final tier of our roundup above.</p>
      <p>That said, this machine justifies its price tag. It's a lovely, finely-crafted laptop, built around a CNC-milled aluminum chassis and available in either the standard matte black or Razer's lovely new Mercury White, a silvery, almost fae finish. Don't let its looks deceive you, though - if you're looking to actually take your gaming on the road, and you expect a little roughness along the way, the Razer 15 remains one of the most durable options in an increasingly crowded market. People often bandy around the phrase 'Razer tax' when they want to knock the company's output, but in this case at least what you're actually paying for is attention to detail, and fit and finish.</p>

      <p>Great battery life<br/>Beautiful high refresh screen<br/>Powerful processor and 16-series GPU<br/>Camera sits below the panel</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a gaming laptop that will last the journey on longer trips, and give you more performance per charge, then the Gigabyte Aero 15 leads the pack here. With a whopping 94.24Whr battery, you can get upwards of six hours of heavy use from it, before needing to plug in. Given that the Aero's base specs are comparable to the other laptops in this list, that extra juice suddenly becomes very important.</p>
      <p>What you get here is a 1660 Ti GPU, the same i7-9750H processor as the MSI, alongside 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512GB Intel 760P SSD. In terms of performance, then, it's very much on a par with the best. It's also one of the first laptops to utilize Microsoft's Azure cloud AI platform to optimize in-game performance, which ultimately means a handful more frames per second to kick out to the 144Hz panel. </p>
