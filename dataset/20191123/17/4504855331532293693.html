      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida county has spent about $182,000 on beer koozies meant to promote the area that an audit found were produced by a government official’s company.</p>
      <p>The South Florida SunSentinel reports that auditors say Carol Hudson used her position as county vice president of sports marketing to buy almost $420,000 in swag for the county. She used her own Saints Enterprises without telling officials of her connection to it.</p>
      <p>An audit released Friday found that is not allowed under county rules.</p>
      <p>County Auditor Bob Melton said he will send a report to the State Attorney’s Office to decide if charges should be filed.</p>
      <p>Hudson resigned in September as the information came to light. Hudson did not return emails Friday seeking comment.</p>
