      <p>Flash floods caused sudden road closures, car crashes and left entire villages cut off in the south west of England today.</p>
      <p>Sudden 'lakes' seized fields and country roads in the heart of Teigngrace, two miles north of Newton Abbot in Devon.</p>
      <p>Cyclist Paul Gale attempted riding through the hamlet when his path vanished under swamp-like rain, reports <a href="https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/pictures-show-roads-vanishing-flash-3571000">Cornwall Live.</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> issued four <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> warnings for Saturday across the UK, including north east england which has already experienced significant disruption.</p>
      <p>Firefighters raced to the rescue of a van driver who crashed into a river and was left trapped as water rose all around the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Two fire engines were scrambled to the scene in Kingsteignton, at around 6.10am today.</p>

      <p>The stricken motorist was plucked to safety from his van by crews in flood rescue suits. He was unharmed.</p>
      <p>In Clyst St Mary, Exeter, heavy rain caused the River Clyst to burst its banks and flood the surrounding area.</p>
      <p>On Friday evening firefighters in Cornwall rescued three people who got stuck after attempting to drive through fast-flowing water.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service said: “Six appliances and two officers were mobilised to a vehicle that reported being stuck in moving flood water after attempting to drive through it.</p>
      <p>“On arrival the first appliance reported that three casualties were sitting on top of their vehicle in deep standing water and rescued them using dry suits and life jackets."</p>
      <p>Exton has also been ravaged by flooding and villagers in Kennford in the early hours were forced to pump out water outside their homes in a battle to protect their community.</p>

      <p>Respiratory consultant Louise Anning tweeted: "Flooding in Kennford early this morning. Pye corner cleared with pumps supplied by the EA and applied by villagers, but river still high."</p>
      <p>More weather misery is also on the way with yellow weather warnings for heavy rain remaining on the county right through to Wednesday next week.</p>

      <p>Met Office weather chiefs warn floods could grip homes and businesses in the days ahead.</p>
