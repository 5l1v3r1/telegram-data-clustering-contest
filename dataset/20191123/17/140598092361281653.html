      <p>The chant ‘sacked in the morning’ is always particularly harrowing for a beaten manager.</p>
      <p>What will most hurt Marco Silva is it was not only the victorious Norwich City supporters directing it at the Everton technical area at full-time. Enough home fans joined in to make this the worst afternoon of Silva's reign - probably his career - after a 2-0 defeat which lifted the Canaries off the bottom. The response was brutal.</p>
      <p>It was difficult to know who was most in a state of disbelief. The away fans enraptured after seeing the first away win since promotion - and first away goals since the opening day - or the hosts who could scarcely believe the insipid manner in which they surrendered control.</p>
      <p>Todd Cantwell gave Norwich a deserved lead early in the second half, and despite persistent Everton pressure sub Dennis Srbeny provoked the home fans' fury in injury time.</p>
      <p>Then it got ugly. One spectator was practically yelling at Bill Kenwright to act as the chairman was making his exit from the Directors Box. Kenwright did not make a swift departure, waiting to hear the supporters’ concerns. </p>
      <p>Former manager David Moyes has been a phone call away from an Everton return for weeks, public support for Silva from his directors’ notorious only by its absence. Farhad Moshiri has often acted at the first hint of mutiny on the Gwladys Street. Most supporters leaving the stadium believed Silva would do well to make it to the press conference still in charge.</p>
      <p>He was as dignified as ever when he did - vowing to fight on - but he has often looked an isolated figure, those above waiting for events to unfold. They must now be proactive, either in vocal support for their coach or announcing who they believe can do better.</p>

      <p>“It is not the main thing to talk about individual positions or this and that,” said Silva.</p>
      <p>“We have to look at what is best for the club. My job is to analyse why this happened. I am concerned about what I can control.”</p>
      <p>Until this weekend, the Portuguese coach had a healthy habit of securing a win when in most dire peril. Unfortunately, he also possesses an unhealthy habit of putting himself back in serious danger with inexplicable defeats.</p>
      <p>Norwich joined Sheffield United as newly promoted sides to win here, and it is the fixtures Everton face next - Leicester, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea - that is creating such anxiety at Goodison.</p>
      <p>Tolerance snapped. The problems with this Everton team are not all of Silva’s making - he is one of many architects responsible for the club’s under-performance - but this was kind of a defeat that usually leads to the ceremonial scapegoat hunt.  </p>
      <p>Everton fans have turned on their coach before, but none received this kind of treatment in their own stadium. Whether Silva is the right man or not, it was uncomfortable viewing.</p>
      <p>“We have to respect the reaction,” said Silva.</p>
      <p>“I can imagine how they feel when they scored the second goal. It is normal they look to the manager. I respect their feeling.”</p>
      <p>Not that Norwich’s fine performance should be overshadowed. If they are to find safety it will not be through physicality or the percentage game associated with the most recent escape acts. There is a purity to the Daniel Farke’s methods.</p>
      <p>“It is the first time this season we had two fit centre-backs. What a difference that makes. We had defensive stability for the first time,” said Farke.</p>
      <p>“We showed are competitive at this level. We are still the favourites for position 20 in this league but maybe we can create another sensation.” </p>
      <p>Farke’s side created plenty of opportunities and would have led sooner but for Jordan Pickford.</p>
      <p>England’s number one’s most notable rescue act of the first half came on 29 minutes. Onel Hernandez was enjoying himself, finding plenty of space on Everton’s right. He was less effective when sent clear by Kenny Mclean, shooting with enough power only to be denied by the force of Pickford’s wristy save. </p>
      <p>The visitors’ frustration did not last. Cantwell took Pukki’s pass on 55 minute to neatly beat Pickford, and sub Srbeny did likewise as Everton’s desperation was exposed.</p>
      <p>Norwich’s long road to survival has begun with a significant step. Silva’s position has never looked so vulnerable.</p>
