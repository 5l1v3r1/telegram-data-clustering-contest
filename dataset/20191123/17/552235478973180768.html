      <p>Two men are wanted by police in connection with the death of a woman who was hit by a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/car-crashes">car.</a></p>
      <p>Alison McBlaine, 36, died in hospital on Thursday after she was hit by a Fiat Punto Grande which police believe deliberately mounted the pavement in Blackburn, Lancashire, at about 7.45pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">Detectives</a> investigating her murder are appealing for information to find Kaylib Connolly, 18, and Dean Qayum, 20.</p>

      <p>The car failed to stop at the scene and was later found on Lower Hollin Bank Street with significant front end damage.</p>

      <p>Attempts had been made to set the vehicle on fire, a spokesman for Lancashire Police said.</p>
      <p>Three people arrested by police remain in custody.</p>
      <p>Detective Chief Inspector Lee Wilson said: "Connolly and Qayum are wanted in connection with this extremely serious offence.</p>
      <p>"They know police want to speak to them and I believe they are being harboured in and around the Blackburn area at this time.</p>

      <p>"I would warn anyone who is protecting them, or helping to hide them, that we will identify this during our investigation and they will also be arrested and prosecuted.</p>
      <p>"My thoughts and those of the team engaged on this inquiry remain with Alison's loved ones, in particular her 12-year-old son Reagan.</p>

      <p>"I would urge anyone with information about what has happened, or who knows where Connolly and Qayum are, to do the right thing - please come forward and speak to police immediately.</p>
      <p>"We will not stop in our efforts to find both men and I would urge the public to help us find those responsible for this brutal and callous attack."</p>
