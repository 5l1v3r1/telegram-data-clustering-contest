        <b>A US Navy veteran whose body was found inside his apartment in Dallas, Texas, is believed to have lain dead there for three years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ronald Wayne White's family said they had reported his absence to the authorities on numerous occasions.</p>
      <p>His body was discovered during an investigation of apartment units whose tenants had not been using water in the DeSoto area complex.</p>
      <p>Staff who broke down the bolted front door found him on the kitchen floor.</p>
      <p>Mr White, who would have been 51 in 2016, had worked as a defence contractor since leaving the US Navy. He lived alone after he and his wife divorced, and frequently travelled outside the US on business.</p>
      <p>His mother, Doris Stevens, who lives in Long Island in New York, said her son had regularly contacted her - but his calls ceased three years ago.</p>
      <p>She said she had reported her son missing to several different police departments, but had been told that because he was an adult and travelled extensively for work, a missing person investigation could not be opened.</p>
      <p>"My biggest question is, how in the world could my son have been dead in that apartment and nobody knows anything?" she told Dallas TV station WFAA.</p>
      <p>"All them days, holidays, I just suffered. Because nobody wanted to help find him."</p>
      <h3>How was he not found before?</h3>
      <p>Mr White's third-floor modern apartment was located at the very north-west corner of the apartment complex, was well-insulated, and had all its windows closed and locked - possibly explaining how his body lay undiscovered for so long.</p>
      <p>Pete Schulte, a detective with the DeSoto Police Department, said Mr White's month-to-month lease on the apartment had been paid from an account into which his Navy retirement fund was regularly paid.</p>
      <p>He said a neighbour had complained about two years ago of liquid leaking through the ceiling of her apartment, but the complex's maintenance team closed the file when the leaking stopped.</p>
      <p>"What I can tell you is it is very clear when officers entered that he had been there for a while," Detective Schulte said. "The way he was found, the way the apartment was arranged and so forth, there was zero indication of foul play."</p>
      <p>More tests to determine the cause of death were due to be completed before the body was released to the family for a funeral.</p>
      <p>Diabetes medication dating back to 2016 was found in the apartment, while Mr White's dust-covered pick-up truck was discovered in the DeSoto Town Center parking garage.</p>
