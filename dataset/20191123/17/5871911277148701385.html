        <b>WBA World Junior Lightweight Championship: Andrew Cancio (c) (21-4-2) vs. Rene Alvarado (31-8)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Luke Irwin:</b> These two tangled in December of 2015, and it ended in eighth round with a KO win over Cancio. Since then, Alvarado has reeled off a couple decent wins, but Cancio has certainly not gotten any worse. For better or worse for themselves, these two tend to go for it. <b>Cancio via R8 TKO.</b></p>

        <b>WBA World Featherweight Championship: Can Xu (c) (17-2) vs. Manny Robles III (18-0)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Luke:</b> On paper, neither of these two have eye-popping knockout numbers, but more recently, they’ve both been finding their hands heavier. I think we get a finish, here. Robles is also 25, same as Xu, but he doesn’t have any signature wins, and yes, he was a legit secondary champion in the NABF, he’ll bounce back from this. <b>Xu via R8 TKO.</b></p>

        <b>Welterweight Bout: Eddie Gomez (23-3) vs. Rashidi Ellis (21-0)</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Luke:</b> When they met in December of 2016, Ellis put down Gomez with a first-round knockout, dropping him twice. It might not end that suddenly, but I’ve got Ellis still coming out on top. <b>Ellis via R4 TKO.</b></p>
