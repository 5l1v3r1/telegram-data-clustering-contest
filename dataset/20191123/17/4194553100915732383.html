      <h1>â€˜Immenseâ€™, â€˜Incredibleâ€™: Some Reds fans react as unreal Van Dijk dominates once again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:13:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool were not at their best for much of the game against Crystal Palace this afternoon but are now 12 points ahead of Manchester City in the Premier League title race before Pep Guardiolaâ€™s side host Chelsea this evening.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane put the Reds in front soon into the second half, before Wilfried Zaha then equalised. Roberto Firmino got the winning goal for Jurgen Klopp after a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner led to a scramble.</p>
      <p>Roy Hodgsonâ€™s team put up an excellent fight and were on top during periods of the match, but one man, in particular, stood up strong to help stave off their attacks.</p>
      <p>Once again, Virgil van Dijk was superb at the back.</p>
      <p>The number of headers he clears is just stupid, in all honesty.</p>
      <p>

          <b>This is how some Reds fans reacted at full-time to his performance:</b>

      <p>Next up in the Premier League is a game at Anfield against Brighton next Saturday. The Reds just need to keep that winning form going for as long as possible, and the title could be ours.</p>
      <p>Even when Zaha scored, it still felt like the Reds would get the job done â€“ and they did exactly that with another late winner.</p>
