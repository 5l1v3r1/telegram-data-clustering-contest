      <p>LEICESTER’S FANTASTIC SEASON under Brendan Rodgers continued today, as they earned a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Brighton.</p>
      <p>After a scoreless first half, Ayoze Pérez opened the scoring just after the hour mark, before Jamie Vardy sealed the win with an 82nd minute penalty.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Southampton took an early lead at the Emirates when Danny Ings fired them in front after Ryan Bertrand’s quick free-kick.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette levelled in the 18th minute after strike partner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s shot was blocked by Bertrand.</p>
      <p>James Ward-Prowse scored in the 71st minute but Lacazette saved Unai Emery’s blushes with a goal deep into stoppage time.</p>
      <p>In-form Wolves won 2-1 at 10-man Bournemouth courtesy of a Joao Moutinho free-kick and Raul Jimenez’s goal to climb to fifth in the table.</p>
      <p>Norwich lifted themselves off bottom spot in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory away to Everton while Burnley beat struggling Watford 3-0.</p>
