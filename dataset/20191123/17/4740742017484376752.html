      <h1>'He was everywhere' - Player ratings as Bristol Rovers beat Shrewsbury Town in 4-3 thriller</h1>
      <h2>Our view from the press box following a bonkers game at New Meadow</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Anssi Jaakkola -</b>
        <b>6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Got booked after handbags when Shrewsbury were denied what looked a decent shout for a penalty. Almost got to the first goal when Josh Laurent was left unmarked six yards out.</p>
      <p>Perhaps some questions could be asked over the hosts' second goal, though - it was clear Ollie Norburn would shoot from the free-kick, yet the far post was left unmanned. As for the third goal, he appeared to let Laurent's header go through his legs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mark Little - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Got forward well and created the Gas' second goal with a volley, but he struggled defensively, particularly when Ryan Giles came on, with Shrewsbury's goals all coming from his wing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rollin Menayese - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hit and miss. He produced some great headed clearances, but also made some mistakes in such a blood and thunder encounter, which, to be fair, is to be expected of a young defender.</p>
      <p>Turned too easily a couple of times by Shrewsbury's pacey attack, and the opening goal came from his side of the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tony Craig - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rovers' best defender. He opened the scoring with a powerful header from a corner and seemed to win everything that came to him in the air. In a feisty, all-action game where various players were losing their heads, Craig kept his and tried to martial the back three.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Alfie Kilgour - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like Menayese, he was hit and miss. Struggled at times when the pace of Louis Thompson ran at him, and was lucky to not give away a penalty when he committed a clumsy tackle on the Shrewsbury player in the penalty area. However, there were other times he did well, winning one or two good tackles and putting in a crucial block after a mix-up between him and Menayese.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Luke Leahy - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Influential at left wing-back. Was not troubled too much in defence and also did well to keep the ball on a consistent basis, linking up well with Liam Sercombe in front of him and putting in some decent crosses, including one that led to Rovers' second goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ollie Clarke - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unleashed in an attacking role and it paid dividends. He pressed the Shrewsbury defence well, winning the ball back high up the pitch on at least two occasions that led to Rovers attacks, and he also linked up well with attacking midfield partner Liam Sercombe, sending some brilliant lofted passes over to his teammate. Showed a poacher's instinct as he stabbed Mark Little's volley into the net.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Ed Upson - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did well to find his man when he got on the ball, and it was noticeable how much better the Gas kept possession with him in the team as opposed to Tuesday night. Yet there were some periods where the game passed him by due to how high octane it was, which did not suit his style of play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Abu Ogogo - 9</b>
      </p>
      <p>Exactly the sort of all-action, high-pace game Ogogo excels in. He was everywhere, winning numerous loose balls and consistently breaking up play in front of his defence.</p>
      <p>Then he popped up with a late winner to cap what was a fantastic performance against his former club. Shrewsbury could not cope with his physicality and energy, and he won the midfield battle.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Liam Sercombe - 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Scored Rovers' third with a fantastic lofted finish and set up the winner as he showed good awareness to tee up Abu Ogogo. Also put in a brilliant corner for Rovers' opener, meaning he had a key part to play in three of their four goals.</p>
      <p>Yet his all-round game was crucial to Rovers in attack - he consistently managed to find space for his teammates to pass to him and, more often than not, he was able to keep possession.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Victor Adeboyejo - 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Struggled to keep the ball, particularly when it was sent long to him. Yet his pace and energy also helped Rovers to press the Shrewsbury defence and created the space needed for Ollie Clarke and Liam Sercombe to thrive.</p>
      <p>Had a couple of sights of goal that were well snuffed out by the defence, and had a goal controversially ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Subs</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tyler Smith, for Adeboyejo, 72 - 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Won some free-kicks in key areas to help the Gas get a foothold in attack when they were coming under pressure at 3-3.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Rodman, for Little,Â  78 - N/A</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tareiq Holmes-Dennis, for Clarke, 90 - N/A</b>
