      <h1>Video: Chase Young Ties Ohio State Sack Record In Return vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:35:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Chase Young is back for Ohio State today after serving a two-game suspension for taking an improper loan at the end of the 2018 season. This is not good news for Penn State.</p>
      <p>The best defensive player in college football is already making a big impact. Young pressured Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford on the Nittany Lions’ first drive. On PSU’s second drive of the game, he made history.</p>
      <p>Young has tied Ohio State’s single-season sack record of 14 with a sack in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>The future top NFL Draft pick has tied Vernon Gholston’s record. He’ll probably break it later in the game.</p>

      <p>Good luck blocking him the rest of the game, Penn State.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is leading the Nittany Lions, 7-0, early in the game.</p>
      <p>It’s being televised on FOX.</p>
