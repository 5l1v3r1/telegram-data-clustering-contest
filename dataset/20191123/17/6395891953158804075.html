      <p>The kittens batted around a golf ball on the fairway at Bonita Fairways Golf Course in Bonita Springs before taking off with the sphere, the <a href="https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/local/communities/the-banner/2019/11/22/bobcat-kittens-play-golf-ball-bonita-fairways-golf-course/4259819002/">Naples Daily News </a>reported.</p>

      <p>Carol Rodgers told the newspaper she saw the frisky felines playing near the 13th hole of the golf course around  8 a.m. Monday. When a golfer hit a drive down the fairway, the bobcats were immediately interested.</p>
      <p>“The two bobcats saw the ball, sniffed it and started playing with it,” Rodgers told the <a href="https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/local/communities/the-banner/2019/11/22/bobcat-kittens-play-golf-ball-bonita-fairways-golf-course/4259819002/">Daily News</a>. “They were having lots of fun wrestling with it.” </p>
      <p>The bobcats are likely 4 to 5 months old, Dave Onorato, a wildlife biologist with the <a href="https://myfwc.com/">Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission</a>, told the newspaper. </p>
      <p>“They are still with Mom at that age,” Onorato wrote in an email. </p>
      <p>The golfer whose ball was stolen was allowed a free drop, the <a href="https://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/local/communities/the-banner/2019/11/22/bobcat-kittens-play-golf-ball-bonita-fairways-golf-course/4259819002/">Daily News</a> reported.</p>
