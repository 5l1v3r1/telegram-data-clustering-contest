      <p>Two British comedy icons will show up with the TARDIS crew for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a>'s twelfth season. Stephen Fry and Sir Lenny Henry CBE will appear alongside Jodi Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor, but details about what roles they'll play have yet to be revealed.</p>
      <p><i>Doctor Who</i> showrunner Chris Chibnall told <a href="https://www.spoilertv.com/2019/11/doctor-who-season-12-stephen-fry-and.html">Spoiler TV</a> that Fry and Henry will both appear in the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-next-episode-2019/">season opener</a>. "<i>Doctor Who</i> is coming back with a bang - with two great British icons in major roles," Chibnall said. "One of the great joys of <i>Doctor Who</i> is getting to work with actors from your wish list."</p>

      <p>Fry also remarked on his upcoming <i>Doctor Who </i>appearance, saying, “Short of being picked for a British space exploration programme and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) - then being in an episode of Doctor Who will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement.”</p>
      <p>Noting that this will be his first time in the Doctor Who universe, Henry said, "The nearest I have been to the <a href="https://screenrant.com/doctor-who-vr-game-trailer-fly-tardis/">TARDIS</a> was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in the Lenny Henry Show, so as a life-long (hiding behind the sofa type) Doctor Who fan this is a very special moment for me.” Fry previously wrote a script for the second season of Doctor Who that went unused, and he voiced the Minister of Chance in the 2002 Seventh Doctor webcast Death Comes to Time, but this will be his first onscreen appearance.</p>
      <p>The new season of Doctor Who will begin in early 2020. The new season and all previous 11 seasons will stream on HBO Max.</p>
