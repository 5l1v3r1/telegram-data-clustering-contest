      <p>Now, the hit-machine has shared picture posing with Tahira on the photo-sharing app. It has been clicked last night at the success bash of actor's recent release <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/'Bala'">'Bala'</a>.

Ayushmann wore a black loose t-shirt with a striped white jacket over it and matching pants while Tahira opted for an all-black look. And once again, his short caption stole our hearts. He wrote, "With her" with a heart emoji.</p>
