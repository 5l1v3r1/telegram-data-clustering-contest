      <p>It's the weekend before Black Friday, but we're already seeing amazing Bose Black Friday headphone deals popping up. If you're after a high quality set of noise cancelling headphones this shopping season, this Bose QuietComfort Series II headset is just £249 this weekend at Amazon. That's a fantastic price considering these flagship headphones were £329 at launch last year. That they rarely see discounts of this caliber is testament to their long-lasted quality and appeal as a set of top-performing audio cans at a mid-range price point. </p>
      <p>With the release of the Bose 700 noise cancelling headphones, the QuietComfort range has dropped nicely in price for <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/best-2019-black-friday-deals">Black Friday</a>. That doesn't mean they're lacking in functionality, however. With incredible sound quality and updated support for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa, these are superior headphones with a robust support for 2019's tech. Plus, you're getting class-leading comfort and a noise cancellation potential you'll rarely find at this price point. </p>
      <p>If you're looking for the perfect Black Friday headphone deal to satisfy your commute or upcoming travel plans, these lightweight but incredibly powerful headphones are just about the best thing going at the moment for their price. Bose Black Friday headphone deals are just getting started, but this is a tidy price reduction on a solid pair of cups that prove you don't have to spend big money for high-quality audio. </p>
      <p>Amazon have also knocked £10 off the latest Bose 700 range (coming in at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Black/dp/B07Q9MJKBV/">£339</a> this weekend) in their Black Friday headphone deals as well as listing their popular Soundlink II headset for just <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bose-SoundLink-Around-Ear-Wireless-Headphones/dp/B0117RGG8E/">£169</a>. These QuietComfort Series II headphones offer a best of both worlds scenario, however, with the high standard of audio and noise cancellation of the 700s and the low price tag of the more entry-level Soundlink range.</p>
