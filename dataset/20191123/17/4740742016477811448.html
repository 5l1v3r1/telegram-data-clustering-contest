      <p>There’s nothing more disheartening than finding the dress of your dreams that simply falls way outside of your budget.</p>
      <p>And with the average price of a wedding dress effortlessly flowing into the thousands, preparing for your big day can be stressful – unless you know exactly where to look.</p>
      <p>Which makes the hidden second-hand bridal shop, hidden above a Gloucester Road charity shop, a secret of many Bristol brides.</p>
      <p>The ground floor of Tenovus is filled with everyday clothing, books and accessories but upstairs is another story.</p>

      <p>The store sells dresses for brides on a budget with low costing designer brands such as Pronovias, Jen Jen House and Benjamin Roberts.</p>
      <p>But as soon as you ascend to the upper-floor, you’re immediately blown away by rows of bridal dresses you can try on ‘till your heart’s content’.</p>

      <p>Shop manager Sheila Cleary says customers are often surprised and shocked by the huge variety and affordable prices.</p>
      <p>She said: “We once had a shopper that was fuming because she saw the exact same dress she had recently purchased for £1,400 and the same identical dress was in our store for £200.”</p>
      <p>While there is nothing better than spotting an inexpensive dress that fits you like a glove, this charity shop allow you to explore with ‘no strings attached’.</p>
      <h3>“It’s about creating an experience for everyone with no strings attached”</h3>

      <p>Mrs Cleary said: “Just pop in, you don’t need to make an appointment you can bring a couple of friends with you just try on anything - hopefully you’ll find one that suits and fits.</p>
      <p>She says people can often feel under pressure when trying on different styles of dresses - especially price wise but at Tenovus, “there is nobody hassling you”.</p>
      <p>She said: “Instead of people feeling embarrassed that they have got a second-hand wedding dress, they should be chuffed - now they have money to spend on other things.</p>
      <p>“People want retro dresses these days - they don’t want great big meringue.”</p>

      <p>Mrs Cleary who has worked in the charity industry for 28 years says Gloucester road has become very cosmopolitan.</p>
      <p>She said: “The area has become very green with people now more aware of saving the planet - donating is a great start.</p>
      <p>“We have had people calling to tell us they have wedding dresses from the 1980s, and we say that is absolutely fine.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Cleary says dresses that are stained or ragged around the edges are sold even cheaper for Halloween or hen parties.</p>

      <p>She said: “Some people just want to come in and spend £20 on a wedding dress and use it for a fancy dress that night.</p>
      <p>“I sold my wedding dress four years ago to be used for bride of Dracula.”</p>
      <h3>What was the experience like?</h3>
      <p>"As soon as I walked in asked to see the bridal section - the staff did not hesitate.</p>
      <p>"I was led up the stairs and told to have fun, explore and take as much time as I needed - it was great," said Shashana.</p>
      <p>For Rema who has plans to get married in the future, experimenting with different styles was just what she wanted.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'd never tried a wedding dress on before, so it was definitely a fun experience and nothing like what I thought it would be.</p>
      <p>“I've always said I only want a small wedding on the beach, but when I put on that dress I didn't want to take it off hahah!."</p>
      <p>Ella said: “Whenever I think of a charity shop, wedding dresses do not spring to mind so to discover a whole floor of second-hand gowns was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“Tenovus offers a great way to save money on dresses without sacrificing style and  I think it’s important to make brides aware that they’re other options, rather than spending a fortune.”</p>
      <h3>What shoppers can look forward to</h3>
      <p>In spring next year the store is set to welcome £70,000 worth of brand new stock including mother of the bride dresses and accessories.</p>
      <p>As part of its bridal launch, shop assistant Lyn Lewis said: “We are hoping to have an opening with balloons and entertainment.”</p>
      <p>For 67-year-old Mrs Cleary reusing a ‘pre-loved dress’ is not only great for the environment but also people on a low income or people having a second marriage.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think people are realising that to pay £1,500 to £2,000 on wedding dresses is just crazy for one day – so it benefits them and the charity.</p>
      <p>“It’s about creating an experience for everyone with no strings attached.”</p>
