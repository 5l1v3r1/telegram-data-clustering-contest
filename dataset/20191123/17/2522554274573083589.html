      <h1>Prosecutors Release Crime Scene Photos From YNW Melly Double Murder Case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:14:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/cvernoncoleman/" target="_blank">C. Vernon Coleman II</a></address>
      <p>The state continues to build its case against <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/ynw-melly/">YNW Melly</a>, who has been <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/03/timeline-ynw-melly-legal-troubles/">charged with double homicide</a> in connection with the murders of two friends. In the latest revelation, the prosecution revealed crime scene photos they say prove Melly was the gunman.</p>
      <p>The pictures were reportedly presented during a bail hearing for Melly's co-defendant, Cortlen Henry, on Oct. 24, and shared by local news outlet <i><a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/picture-gallery/news/crime/indian-river-county/2019/10/24/crime-scene-photos-jamell-demons-ynw-melly-case-released-prosecutors/4070347002/">Treasure Coast Palm</a></i> on Nov. 21. Melly, born Jamell Demons, is accused of the shooting deaths of his friends Anthony Williams (a.k.a. YNW Sakchaser) and Christopher Thomas Jr. (a.k.a. YNW Juvy) on Oct. 26, 2018, while all four men sat in a car. Police believe he and Henry then concocted a plan to say Thomas and Williams were victims of a drive-by shooting, and Henry later dropped the dead bodies off at the hospital and told the tale.</p>
      <p>During the court hearing, prosecutors shared photos the Miramar Police Department gathered from scene during the investigation. The first image shows how authorities believe all four men were seated in the vehicle when the crime took place. Other photos show the positions of .40 caliber shell casing that were located by the police. More pictures mark bullet trajectory in the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Investigators say ballistics tests prove the drive-by was staged, as they reveal that many of the shots came from inside the vehicle, therefore disproving Henry's story. The prosecution also used cellphone tracking data to prove Melly was at the scene at the time. The photos were presented at the court hearing to prove Henry should be denied bail until trial.</p>
