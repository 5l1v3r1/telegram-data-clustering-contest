      <h1>Indonesia may join growing vaping ban after illness reaches Asia</h1>
      <h2>The move comes a week after a teenager in central Philippines who had been vaping for six months and also smoking cigarettes was diagnosed with a lung injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:56:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The world’s second-largest tobacco market, Indonesia, is weighing a total ban on electronic cigarettes, joining a growing number of nations cracking down on vaping due to health concerns.</p>
      <p>The Indonesian government is working on revising existing e-cigarette regulations, said Mr Anung Sugihantono, the Health Ministry’s director general of disease control and prevention. “The ministry’s stance is consistent: We want to ban, not limit, vaping and e-cigarettes,” he said in a text message this week.</p>
      <p>The move comes a week after a teenager in central Philippines who had been vaping for six months and also smoking cigarettes was diagnosed with a lung injury - likely the first known case in Asia of the mystery illness that has killed 47 people in the United States and afflicted over 2,000.</p>
      <p>If Indonesia follows its South-east Asian neighbours like the Philippines and Singapore in banning vaping, the region will be all but sealed off to e-cigarette companies.</p>
      <p>Once thought of as a useful tool to help smokers quit, the lung illness outbreak has swiftly turned regulatory attitudes around the world against vaping.</p>
      <p>It is now banned by around 30 countries including India and Brazil, while China, the world’s biggest smoking market, has been tightening rules around the practice.</p>
      <p>The proposed ban will be another setback for Juul Labs, which began selling its products in Indonesia earlier this year in partnership with PT Erajaya Swasembada, a distributor known for selling Apple’s iPhones.</p>
      <p>Juul’s business in the US is struggling under regulatory scrutiny of whether it marketed products to teenagers.</p>
      <p>Tobacco smokers make up 35 per cent of Indonesia’s 264 million population, according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p>The market is dominated by cigarette makers PT Hanjaya Mandala Sampoerna, a Philip Morris unit, PT Gudang Garam and PT Djarum.</p>
      <p>The Indonesian Personal Vaporiser Association, a group of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/e-cigarettes">e-cigarettes </a>importers, vape shop owners and vaping enthusiasts, said that the government should hold public discussions with stakeholders before imposing any restrictions.</p>
      <p>Indonesia has not reported any cases of vaping-related illness, and the rising popularity of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/e-cigarettes">e-cigarettes </a>showed that smokers see benefits in switching over from traditional cigarettes, association chief Garindra Kartasasmita said.</p>
