      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The former Miss England says her husband has no problem with her posting sexy pictures online, and Katie should do it too</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:26:58+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:26</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/danielle-lloyd">Danielle Lloyd</a> says she's been encouraging Katie Price to sign up to Only Fans and share X-rated pics online.</p>
      <p>The website sees people pay a subscription to gain access to people's sexually-charged pictures and videos.</p>
      <p>Danielle has been offering fans the chance to buy her saucy topless snaps for £115, and it had been reported that <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> was jealous of the attention she was getting.</p>
      <p>But the former Miss England, 35, says that's absolutely not the case.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-four, who has just celebrated her first wedding anniversary with husband Michael O'Neill, exclusively told Mirror Online: "Katie actually reached out to me and I spoke to her about it and the Only Fans site and I told her she should do it too! Why not? It's nice people can compliment you when they see your pictures on there. It gives you a boost and it gives you more confidence.</p>

      <p>"I don't think Katie is jealous at all, I told her to go for it!</p>
      <p>"My Michael and I are really strong and have no secrets and he was happy for me to do it. It's no different to when I did glamour shoots really is it?</p>
      <p>"I would encourage other women to do it, you don’t have to be in the best shape of your life it’s about how it makes you feel. It's given me my confidence back and it makes me feel good when I get compliments. My husband certainly doesn't mind."</p>
      <p>Danielle spoke out as she was getting a new facial 3D-HydrO2 from market leaders in non-invasive treatments <a href="https://www.3d-lipo.co.uk/introducing-3d-hydro2-facial/">3D lipo</a> .</p>
      <p>She's got a new-found confidence following her recent surgery.</p>

      <p>Danielle feels better than ever after going under the knife for a boob job, liposuction and a Brazilian bump lift to give her look an overhaul.</p>
      <p>She told us: "Obviously the surgery has made me feel much more confident and now I do feel sexier. But now it's about doing what I can to keep looking and feeling good.</p>
      <p>"I went to the 3D Lipo spa clinic in Leamington Spa to have the 3D-HydrO2 facial to prepare for our first wedding anniversary date night. I'd heard it was the best new facial around and so I didn't mind travelling a bit to try it.</p>
      <p>"The 3D-HydrO2 facial uses seven advanced technologies so it targets everything at once from congestion to firming, which is perfect for me because I'm so busy. It's the perfect five star facial.</p>

      <p>"I wanted to feel the best I could and I really do feel great. My skin is so fresh and glowy I could go out without makeup."</p>
      <p>She added: "It's so cold now, and I find myself more covered up so it's nice to treat yourself to a facial so you have a nice glow when everything else is hidden!</p>
      <p>"Because my husband Michael is younger than me I like to do what I can to look the best I can. I want to stop the ageing process! I'll try anything to keep looking good and I think the 3D-HydrO2 facial will definitely be part of my routine moving forward.</p>
