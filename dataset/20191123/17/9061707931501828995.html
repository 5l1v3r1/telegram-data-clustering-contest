      <p>A Derby landlord says his new pub is the best in Derby.</p>
      <p>Kelvin Garvey, the new landlord at the<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/normanton"> Loudon Arms, in Normanton</a> said: “Most pubs in Derby don’t have what we’ve got.</p>
      <p>“Everything has been changed inside the whole pub. We’ve got Sky Sports, live music, DJs on a Friday and Saturday and Caribbean food on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I’m appealing to everybody. People are coming from town just to come here. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/pubs">It’s the best pub in Derby."</a></p>
