      <h1>India Inc. holds on to cash, cuts capex despite lower tax rate</h1>
      <h2>Top 1,000 listed firms to save up to ₹65,000 crore from tax cuts, says Ind-Ra</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:30:35+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Piyush-Pandey-367/" target="_blank">Piyush Pandey</a></address>
      <p>The top 1,000 listed entities will save up to ₹65,000 crore from the tax cut measures announced in FY20, which will include ₹9,000 crore savings for banks and ₹6,000 crore for the struggling non-banks, according to estimates by India Ratings and Research.</p>
      <p>However, companies are seen holding on to cash and cutting down on capital expenditure (capex) in the remaining part of this fiscal.</p>
      <p>Hindalco Industries has cut down its capex of ₹2,700 crore committed for this fiscal to ₹2,300 crore in the first quarter. The company further cut its capex to ₹2,000 crore after the end of the second quarter.</p>
      <p>“We have reduced our capex to ₹2,000 crore and most of it will go towards our downstream expansion,” Satish Pai, MD, Hindalco Industries, told <i>The Hindu</i>. On debt reduction, he said, “We have net debt of ₹40,710 crore. At current LME (London Metals Exchange) prices, we will not be able to repay any debt.”</p>
      <p>Tata Steel has reduced its capex guidance to ₹8,000 crore from ₹11,000 crore committed at the start of this fiscal.</p>
      <p>“Capex numbers may see more reduction in the coming quarters,” said Tata Steel Group CFO Koushik Chatterjee.</p>
      <p>“The slowdown had an impact on the working capital.” In the prevailing conditions, JSW Steel has deferred its capex of ₹4,700 crore to the next fiscal.</p>
      <p>Reliance Industries, which drove India Inc.’s capital expenditure in the last three years with investments exceeding ₹3.5 lakh crore, has reached the fag end of its capex cycle.</p>
      <h3>Airport expansion</h3>
      <p>Talking about private sector capital expenditure, S.N. Subrahmanyan, MD and CEO, L&amp;T, said, “Capex is happening in the expansion of some airports because there is no space. There is no significant capex happening in the private sector.”</p>
      <p>Telecom major Vodafone Idea has reduced its capex for this fiscal to ₹13,000 crore from the ₹17,000 crore announced earlier.</p>
