      <p>BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND - NOVEMBER 02: Sadio Mane of Liverpool celebrates with teammate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain after scoring his team's second goal during the Premier League match between Aston Villa and Liverpool FC at Villa Park on November 02, 2019 in Birmingham, United Kingdom.

      <p>Elsewhere, second-placed Leicester beat Brighton 2-0 to stay eight points behind Jurgen Klopp’s leaders while struggling Arsenal were held 2-2 at home by Southampton.</p>
      <p>Liverpool looked set to drop points for just the second time this season after Wilfried Zaha cancelled out Sadio Mane’s opener but Roberto Firmino poked in after a goalmouth scramble to seal a 2-1 win.</p>
      <p>Hosts Palace were denied a shock first-half opener when James Tomkins’ header was disallowed after VAR adjudged that Jordan Ayew had fouled Dejan Lovren.</p>
      <p>Second-half goals from Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy gave Leicester their fifth successive league win.</p>
      <p>In the early kick-off at the London Stadium, Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane were on the scoresheet for Spurs as Mourinho won his first game in charge 3-2 days after replacing the sacked Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The win — the club’s first away league victory since January — will help to endear Mourinho to a sceptical Spurs support, who were sad to see Pochettino dismissed just six months after leading the club to a first-ever Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Mourinho followed Pochettino’s example in leaving out Christian Eriksen, with the Dane one of a number of Spurs players into the final months of his contract and showing no signs of agreeing a new deal.</p>
      <p>“It was very, very important. Eleven months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile, without happiness and they did it,” said Mourinho on ending Spurs’ away-day blues.</p>
      <p>“That’s where I belong (on the touchline), that is my natural habitat,” added Mourinho. “I just love it. When things go in your direction, winning is the best feeling.”</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss will know he has far stiffer challenges ahead of him than a struggling West Ham, who have now lost five out of their past six Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arsenal under pressure</b>
      </p>
      <p>Southampton took an early lead at the Emirates when Danny Ings fired them in front after Ryan Bertrand’s quick free-kick.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette levelled in the 18th minute after strike partner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s shot was blocked by Bertrand.</p>
      <p>James Ward-Prowse scored in the 71st minute but Lacazette saved Unai Emery’s blushes with a goal deep into stoppage time.</p>
      <p>In-form Wolves won 2-1 at 10-man Bournemouth courtesy of a Joao Moutinho free-kick and Raul Jimenez’s goal to climb to fifth in the table.</p>
      <p>Norwich lifted themselves off bottom spot in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory away to Everton while Burnley beat struggling Watford 3-0.</p>
      <p>Manchester City are playing Chelsea in the evening kick-off, with Pep Guardiola desperate for a win to breathe new life into his team’s title challenge after three defeats in City’s opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>But Frank Lampard’s in-form side are not the visitors Guardiola would have picked as he looks to keep Liverpool in his sights, with six league wins on the bounce for his young side.</p>
