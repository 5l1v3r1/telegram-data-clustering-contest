      <p>Martyn Waghorn came off the bench to score the goal that secured  a 1-0 victory for Derby over Preston.</p>
      <p>Waghorn diverted the ball in from close range in the first half and Derby could have had more goals against a strangely subdued Preston who created little.</p>
      <p>Declan Rudd kept them in the game with saves from Waghorn and Tom Lawrence with Preston’s Tom Barkhuizen hitting the top of the bar in the second half.</p>
      <p>Craig Forsyth returned to the Derby side a year after suffering a third serious knee injury in place of injured central defender Matt Clarke.</p>
      <p>Phillip Cocu’s side made a confident start with Lawrence firing narrowly wide from distance in the fifth minute.</p>
      <p>But Preston had a good chance four minutes later when a free kick set up  Daniel Johnson and, when his shot was blocked, Patrick Bauer fired over from 10 yards.</p>
      <p>Derby had to make a change in the 15th minute when Graeme Shinnie appeared to suffer a hamstring injury and was replaced by George Evans but the home side went close twice in the space of two minutes.</p>
      <p>First Duane Holmes rattled the bar with a volley before Lawrence broke away in the 19th minute and hit a low drive which Rudd turned behind.</p>
      <p>Jayden Stockley fired just wide but Derby almost broke through when Mason Bennett was brought down just outside the box by Darnell Fisher who was booked.</p>
      <p>Bennett limped off in the 28th minute and his replacement Waghorn had a great chance three minutes later when Holmes put him through but Rudd turned his shot over.</p>
      <p>But Waghorn was in the right place in the 33rd minute when a corner was headed on and he chested it past Rudd from six yards.</p>
      <p>Preston could have no complaints because they had been second best but Derby had a scare in stoppage time when Kelle Roos dropped a free kick but the visitors could not take advantage.</p>
      <p>Derby had another chance in the 54th minute when Krystian Bielik’s pass put Waghorn in but his shot was easily saved.</p>
      <p>Preston had the ball in the net three minutes later but the flag was up for offside and Jayden Bogle was close to adding a second with a shot that went just wide in the 64th minute.</p>
      <p>But Derby were dropping deeper and had a scare in the 77th minute when a free kick dropped to Barkhuizen who grazed the bar with a 15 yard shot.</p>
      <p>Preston dominated possession in the closing minutes but could not fashion a clear chance as Derby held on for a fifth successive Pride Park victory.</p>
