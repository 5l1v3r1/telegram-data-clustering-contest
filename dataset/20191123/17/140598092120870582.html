      <p>On the day Jose Mourinho returned to the Premier League, Wolves fans were left singing ‘Nuno’s the Special One’ as their own Portuguese manager masterminded an impressive victory of his own.</p>
      <p>It lifts Wolves into fifth place as Raul Jimenez scored his fourteenth goal of the season, a tally that leaves him level with Raheem Sterling.</p>
      <p>Santo’s classy side had eased into a two goal lead in half an hour as Bournemouth struggled to match their movement and tenacity in the early stages.</p>
      <p>It was a nightmare 45 minutes for Howe’s men as captain Simon Francis was sent off ten minutes before half time for two bookings. He was starting his first game in the Premier League since December following a cruciate knee ligament injury.</p>
      <p>Francis picked up his first booking as he scythed down Diogo Jota just outside the penalty area as Wolves raced down the left.</p>
      <p>Joao Moutinho punished the mistake but curling a brilliant free-kick into the top right-hand corner leavning Aaron Ramsdale stranded in the Bournemouth goal.</p>
      <p>Ten minutes later they had a second, this time exploiting space on the other flank.</p>
      <p>Moutinho was once again integral, initiating a quick free-kick to release Adam Traore who centred for Raul Jimenez to score from close range.</p>

      <p>Howe brought on Jefferson Lerma and Arnaut Danjuma at the break and the Cherries found a lifeline.</p>
      <p>It came just before the hour mark when Steve Cook rose to meet Ryan Fraser’s free kick at the near post and glance it into the far corner.</p>
      <p>Wolves continued to look dangerous on the break and Jota might have won it when he broke clear only to be denied by Ramsdale.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth then went close as Nathan Ake struck a fierce volley which Rui Patricio beat away.</p>
      <p>It proved just a momentary glimmer of hope for Bournemouth as Wolves once again seized control in the closing stages.</p>
      <p>Howe’s side have struggled for consistency, winning only once in their past seven games, at home to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Danjuma might have found an equaliser here but blazed over with the last kick of the game to give Wolves the victory they they’d earned.</p>
