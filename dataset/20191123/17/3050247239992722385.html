      <h1>OKEx Secures Support From Four New Partners for Its Utility Token OKB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:22:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Ana Alexandre</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/deutsche-telekoms-blockchain-firm-partners-with-malta-govt-agency">Malta</a>-based cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/not-a-fee-but-long-term-payment-how-crypto-exchanges-list-tokens">OKEx</a> has secured support from four new partners, including hardware crypto wallet Ledger, for its utility token OKB.</p>
      <p>OKEx announced the news in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Nov. 22, detailing that it had partnered with Ledger, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ho-chi-minh-city-to-develop-blockchain-regulations-for-smart-cities">Vietnam</a>-based over-the-counter exchange Aliniex, fiat-to-crypto exchange Bvnex, and virtual blockchain-powered retailer Cryptomall.</p>
      <h3>Bringing crypto trades into the mainstream</h3>
      <p>The collaboration is aimed at moving the OKB ecosystem into the mainstream, as well as making it more comprehensive for its global user base. The company specified in the release, that OKB will be listed on Ledger’s hardware crypto wallet, Aliniex and Bvnex. Aliniex, which enables users to purchase and sell digital currency with Vietnamese Dong (VND), will also support OKB/VND trades.</p>
      <p>Cryptomall — a marketplace that maintains transaction records on the blockchain — will now accept OKB, thus giving OKEx users’ access to more than 1 million products. Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx, said that the partnerships will “expand OKB’s utility, making it easier for traders to participate in the cryptocurrency markets all over the world.”</p>
      <h3>OKEx’s other recent developments</h3>
