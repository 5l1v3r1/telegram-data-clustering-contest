      <h1>Star Wars: This Key TLJ Moment Was Former Rise of Skywalker Director's Idea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:11:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Conner</a></address>
      <p>It was recently revealed that a big moment from <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-last-jedi/">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</a> </i>actually came from the original <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/"><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i></a> director, Colin Trevorrow.</p>
      <p>During <i>The Last Jedi</i>'s production, Trevorrow asked if a scene from his own script could be included in the film. Trevorrow told <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/colin-trevorrow-star-wars-rise-skywalker-last-jedi/">Empire</a> about his conversation with <i>The Last Jedi</i>'s director, Rian Johnson. "I just asked Rian if he could include a little moment where Rey and Poe meet for the first time," he said.</p>

      <p>"They’re such beloved characters," Trevorrow continued, "It felt right for them to have some history in the next movie. I thought the way he did it was perfect." While Trevorrow, who also is the overseer of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/jurassic-world/"><i>Jurassic World</i></a>, did not end up directing <i>Rise of Skywalker</i>, he did earn a story credit for his contributions to the film.</p>
