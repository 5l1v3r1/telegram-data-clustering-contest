      <p>ADELANI ADEPEGBA</p>
      <p>A non-governmental organisation, Drivers’ Welfare Club of Nigeria, has concluded plans to set up a database of all commercial drivers in the country.</p>
      <p>The group said the database which is expected to enhance security and the growth of the transport sector would also include the biometrics of the participants.</p>
      <p>Announcing this in Abuja on Saturday, DWCN President, Mr Monday Elimigbe said the database would make it easy for security agencies to track down erring drivers, adding that the facility would also enhance plans for the welfare of drivers in the country.</p>
      <p>Elimigbe explained that the biometric exercise would commence at the Moshood Abiola Stadium, Abuja, from December 10-12, 2019, adding that many road union organizations had indicated interest in the initiative.</p>
      <p>He stated, “This project has the support of the Federal Road Safety Corps and other transport and security stakeholders who know the benefits of the scheme and the essence of the collation of the drivers’ data exercise which will help to promote the contributions of drivers to national development and regulate the excesses of drivers. It will also help in the growth of the transport sector and help with legislation and policy.”</p>
      <p>Elimigbe argued that the transport unions had no data of the commercial drivers, stating that the exercise “would ensure the registration of all authentic drivers.”</p>
      <p>He added, “With this database, the identity of any driver complicit in any criminal act could easily be noted. As far as I am concerned, if you are not a driver, you should not be found taking passengers at a motor park.”</p>
