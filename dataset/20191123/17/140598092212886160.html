      <p>It was not only <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/jose-mourinho-vows-revive-real-dele-alli-targets-trophies-keep/">Dele Alli’s “brother”</a> who was turning up in a Spurs shirt. All sorts of siblings, cousins and lookalikes were pulling on jerseys as the Mauricio Pochettino years fizzled out. The real players are now clocking back on.</p>
      <p>Now we know what Mourinho was doing when he asked his biggest under-achiever: “Are you Dele or Dele’s brother?” He was sending a message to all his players. No more hiding. And Dele responded with an improved performance topped off by a beautiful back-heel, right in front of his new manager, when he was on his backside on the touchline. That piece of magic led to Tottenham’s second goal in a<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/"> 3-2 win</a> that was more comfortable than the scoreboard suggests.</p>
      <p>“The piece of skill was amazing, but for me the thing that’s more amazing is the mental thing in relation to that,” Mourinho said. “You only do that if you’re focused, committed, ultra-confident. If you have the bad feelings, the sadness, you don’t do that. The skill is amazing but it only comes from the emotional point of view when everything is positive.”</p>
      <p>Dele will wake feeling Mourinho did a ‘number’ on him. A good number, at that. A first away league win since January tells you just how far Spurs had fallen in the Premier League. But the team’s slide presented Mourinho with a big opportunity. Peppered across his squad are players who are better than they have looked in recent months; players who were detached or demoralised. Task No 1 for Pochettino’s successor was to get them motoring again.</p>
      <p>Mourinho went straight for the top, picking out his most talented under-achiever with that “brother” tease. Start with Dele Alli, then work your way down. And a wounding poke at the forgotten man of Gareth Southgate’s England midfield will be followed by other messages to other players, even if Dele himself sounded unsure what to make of it. He was shaking his head when he was taken off on 78 minutes but was hugged by Mourinho and spoken to again on the pitch after the whistle. </p>

      <p>“He made a joke about it, but a lot of people have been talking about that for a few years now. It’s nothing new to me really,” Dele said. “A lot of people say to me - am I going to find my old form? I don’t want to find my old form, I want to improve on it.”</p>
      <p>Dele was prominent in an exuberant first-half from Spurs. Lucas Moura, Harry Winks and Heung-Min Son were also full of life as Mourinho’s front-line cut through West Ham’s defence. Mourinho spoke of “the old Dele” being back but the old Spurs were also visible. Son and Harry Kane are a gift to any manager. Moura, Dele and Christian Eriksen (for as long as he stays) can provide the support to those prolific strikers to drive Spurs back towards the Champions League spots. The concession of two second-half goals however will send Mourinho back into the war room where he sweats over defensive strategies.</p>
      <p>But there are so many players in this Tottenham squad who are capable of restoring them to the top four places - the main aim, for now. One by one Mourinho will work his way through the squad applying a mix of persuasion and coercion. Pricking Dele’s pride was the start. The tactics will vary. Mourinho will aim to convert a critical mass of players so he can hunt down Leicester and Chelsea in the top four and perhaps win a domestic Cup.</p>
      <p>“I think Dele was like the team. He was brilliant for 60-65 mins and then he paid also the price of the tiredness, so he went a little bit down,” Mourinho said. “But I think it was the old Dele Alli , the Dele Alli of a couple of years ago who impressed not only England but the world. He did exactly what I wanted him to do.”</p>
      <p>Positional discipline is never far from Mourinho’s thoughts about how a player has performed. He praised Dele for filling “exactly the space we wanted him to play in, offensively and defensively. He’s an intelligent football player who understands what we wanted.” There will be no blank licence to entertain. Nor was there in Pochettino’s time, but Mourinho will seek a tighter balance between the team’s attacking intent and retreating and pressing en masse.</p>
      <p>“Dele Alli is too good not to be in the national team, too good not to be one of the best players in the world,” Mourinho told television crews. You get the message. The new manager is going to save these players, make them winners again, restore the joy. It was fairly heavy-handed - but it worked.</p>
