      <p>A quick-thinking doctor is being hailed as a hero after he used an improvised catheter to suck urine from an ailing man’s bladder.</p>
      <p>While on a nine-hour flight from China, a 70-year-old man began to experience pain and collapsed, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10405651/doctor-urine-bladder-flight-video/">according</a> to the <i>Sun</i>. He told flight attendants that he was unable to urinate and that his bladder was close to rupturing.</p>
      <p>Dr. Zhang Hong and Dr. Xiao Zhangxiang sprung into action and fashioned a catheter out of a syringe, a milk straw, and a plastic tube. Zhang then spent 37 minutes sucking the man’s urine from his bladder into his mouth.</p>
      <p>“He was going into shock and may have suffered a risk to his life if we didn't tend to him urgently,” Zhang said. “His family said he had a history of prostate enlargement, so we suspected this was causing urinary retention.”</p>
      <p>“Saving lives is a doctor's instinct,” he added.</p>
