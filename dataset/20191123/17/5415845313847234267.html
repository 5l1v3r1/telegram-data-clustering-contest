      <h2>Upon the return of the international break, Arsenal hosted Southampton on Saturday in desperate need of a win. Here are five things we learned from the 2-2 draw.</h2>

      <p>The international breaks are routinely the worst parts of the football season. And yet, if you were to offer me the chance to return to the safety, solitude and silence of an international break, after yet another dismal <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/?s=arsenal">Arsenal</a> display in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/50091735">Saturday’s 2-2 draw against 19th-placed Southampton</a>, I would not hesitate to take it. The Gunners did what they always do under Unai Emery: played poorly, were bailed out by their strikers, and lost yet more points against a lesser team that they should be dismantling.</p>

      <h3>5. Hector Bellerin isn’t sharp</h3>
      <p>Before I touch on more pertinent subjects like Unai Emery, which is all that the Arsenal fanbase is currently discussing, I would first like to highlight the individual problems of Hector Bellerin ever since his return from an ACL tear. The Spaniard has not looked sharp all season long, and the same issues arose here.</p>
      <p>Initially, it was his play in possession that was extremely concerning. Loose passes, wayward first touches, losing the ball cheaply and allowing Southampton to threaten in transition. Not good. But then he looked lacklustre in other areas, like when Ryan Bertrand surged past him with a good run off the ball to drive to the by-line. Or when he sailed yet another cross way over the heads of his teammates in the penalty area.</p>
      <p>I do not want to criticise Bellerin too heavily. This was not his best performance, like many of his outings this season, but that is more relevant to his recovery from injury, not his ability. For a player who relies on his explosive athleticism, tearing an ACL is horrible. It can take months to rediscover that match sharpness, and for Bellerin, that is playing out this year.</p>
