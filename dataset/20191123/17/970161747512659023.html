      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ellie-brown/">Ellie Brown</a> has confirmed her relationship status after rumours started to swirl she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> Michael Griffiths.</p>
      <p>The star took to Instagram with a picture of herself posing in front of the camera with her hand raised up to her head.</p>
      <p>And while there was no mention of her fellow islander in the caption, she did tease she was seeing someone.</p>
      <p>‘When ur mans giving u a migraine,’ the 21-year-old wrote to her followers.</p>
      <p>However, the reality star’s Ex on the Beach pal, Sophie Kasaei, was quick to comment and called her out on the phrase.</p>

      <p>‘Who’s ya mandem then,’ she quizzed underneath the snap.</p>
      <p>Replying to her buddy, it turns out Ellie is actually not seeing anyone, as she confessed: ‘I couldn’t be anymore single just thought it was a funny caption.’</p>

      <p>The post comes just days after it was rumoured Ellie was secretly seeing Michael – who previously dated Love Island’s reigning champ, Amber Gill.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10354877/love-island-ellie-brown-michael-griffiths/">The Sun</a>: ‘Ellie and Michael hit it off during filming on Ex On The Beach and now they’ve started dating.</p>

      <p>‘They were supposed to keep the relationship under wraps until the show had aired of course, but it seems they just couldn’t keep quiet.’</p>
      <p>The insider added: ‘They both know what it’s like to be caught up in the drama of a big reality TV show and they really bonded during their time on the programme.</p>
      <p>‘Now there’s a new Love Island couple on the block.’</p>
      <p>Michael is yet to address the speculation, however it seems as though he’s keeping busy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/02/michael-griffiths-joining-us-version-ex-beach-failing-love-twice-10670878/">as it’s said he’ll be joining the cast of Ex On The Beach.</a></p>
      <p>Talking about his venture, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/13/amber-gill-shades-michael-griffiths-ex-on-the-beach-stint-as-she-addresses-love-island-feud-claims-10907474/">the star’s ex Amber told Metro.co.uk:</a> ‘Good for him… That’s a good opportunity for him, I have to say. That is a good opportunity.’</p>
      <p>But she insisted we wouldn’t be seeing her rocking up to said beach anytime soon, as she continued: ‘I haven’t got time to be doing things like Ex On The Beach…’</p>
