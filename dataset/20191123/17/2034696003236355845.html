      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/Billie-Eilish">Billie Eilish</a> appeared on <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live</i> last night, presenting the question posed by her debut album title ‘When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’ to various children – with responses ranging from imaginative to disturbing.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old singer was interviewed by Kimmel about the year she’s had, but also featured on the dream-based segment later in the show. “You could pretty much go anywhere,” a child called Atticus told the ‘Bad Guy’ singer in one of the more positive responses.</p>
      <p>“Like the desert, India, the West times or the mummy times, or dinosaur times, or prehistoric times.” Watch the full clip below.</p>

      <p>Another child talked about escaping zombies in her dreams, which Eilish congratulated her on. A third child, Michael, went a little deeper with his comments on Pennywise, the evil force that manifests as a clown in Stephen King’s <i>IT</i>. “I’ve seen him before,” the boy says.</p>
      <p>After Eilish asks if he means in dreams, the boy replied: “No. In real life. I bought him here. He’s on top of your head. He’s sitting on your head and eating candy and he’s eating a cat, and a dog, and a duck, and a fox, and a person. And he’s drinking a grandmother. And he’s eating you.”</p>
      <p>“You’re a weird little dude, Michael,” the singer concluded.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week (November 19), <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/billie-eilish-launching-childrens-clothing-range-2569343">Eilish also appeared to launch her own children’s clothing range</a>. The artist shared news of the development via a touching post on her Instagram, where she was surrounded by children wearing matching items from the range in her signature neon green look.</p>
      <p>Eilish later shared further images of the clothes which are <a href="https://store.universalmusic.com/billieeilish/">available to buy from her online store now.</a></p>
