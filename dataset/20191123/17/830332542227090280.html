      <p>(CNN) - Cartoonist Gahan Wilson, whose magazine illustrations earned him the nicknames "the Michelangelo of the Macabre" and "the Wizard of Weird," has died at 89, according to his stepson Paul Wilson.</p>
      <p>"The world has lost a legend," Paul Wilson said. "One of the very best cartoonists to ever pick up a pen and paper has passed on."</p>
      <p>Gahan Wilson gained fame with his offbeat drawings in magazines like Playboy, The New Yorker and National Lampoon.</p>
      <p>One drawing featured a man deliriously happy as he is being strapped into the electric chair and saying, "Gee, it's just like in the movies."</p>
      <p>Another showed an eye doctor with a knife about to attack a patient who is reading an exam chart that says, "I am an insane eye doctor and I am going to kill you now..."</p>
      <p>On Halloween, Gahan Wilson posted an old image from Playboy on his Facebook page.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfdF_LShSig">Wilson told David Letterman</a> in 1982 that he was always attracted to circus sideshows and freaks.</p>
      <p>"They're fun," he said. "They're nice people."</p>
      <p>He said he originally had read classic gothic novels for inspiration but then found it more abundant in everyday life.</p>
      <p>"The daily papers and television news are a much better source of grotesque humor," he said.</p>
      <p>His stepson wrote on Facebook that Wilson, born February 18, 1930, died peacefully surrounded by loved ones on Thursday.</p>
      <p>On his website, Wilson said he made it through a "chink in the armor" of big-time magazine publishing when an editor laughed at his work but didn't realize it was "too much for the common man" to understand.</p>
      <p>"The creative artist is automatically an outsider, because he sees through the world that everybody else takes as the final reality, and he's a very scary kind of guy."</p>
