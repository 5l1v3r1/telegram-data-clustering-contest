      <p>South Korea says it is to continue a military intelligence-sharing pact with Japan that had been threatened by a long-running dispute.</p>
      <p>The move was welcomed by the US which had urged the two countries to settle their differences, the BBC reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Seoul announced its decision on Friday, just hours before the pact was due to expire.</p>
      <p>Tensions between South Korea and Japan go back decades but have recently led to a series of tit-for-tat measures.</p>
      <p>The tensions have historical roots, and the two countries became embroiled in a deepening trade and diplomatic dispute this year.</p>
      <p>The intelligence pact, known as GSOMIA (General Security of Military Information Agreement), allowed the two countries to share information about North Korea’s military and nuclear activities directly with each other.</p>
      <p>Without it, the information would have had to go through their joint-allies in Washington, slowing the process down.</p>
      <p>In August, South Korea announced it would terminate the intelligence-sharing agreement and Japan removed South Korea’s favoured trade partner status and imposed export controls on its electronics sector.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month the leaders of the two countries briefly met at a summit in Bangkok, Thailand, to try to resolve their differences.</p>
      <p>Then on Friday South Korea said it would “conditionally” suspend the expiry, with national security official Kim You-geun confirmed that the GSOMIA would not be allowed to lapse at midnight.</p>
      <p>He said the Japanese government had “expressed their understanding” but warned that the agreement could still “be terminated at any time”.</p>
      <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said bilateral relations were vital and that South Korea had made a “strategic decision” in sticking with the accord.</p>
      <p>A US State Department spokeswoman welcomed the decision, saying: “This decision sends a positive message that like-minded allies can work through bilateral disputes.”</p>
      <p>The two countries share a complicated history. They have fought on and off since at least the 7th Century, and Japan has repeatedly tried to invade the peninsula since then.</p>
      <p>In 1910, it annexed Korea, turning the territory into a colony. Resentment over this period, when many South Korean workers were forced to work for Japanese firms, continues today.</p>
      <p>The issue was recently brought to the fore by a 2018 South Korean supreme court ruling that ordered Japanese firms to compensate Koreans it used as forced labour.</p>
      <p>The decisions drew condemnation from Japan, which argues the dispute was settled in 1965 when diplomatic ties were normalised between the neighbouring countries.</p>
      <p>The row has since escalated and has impacted their modern trade relationship, threatening industries such as technology.</p>
