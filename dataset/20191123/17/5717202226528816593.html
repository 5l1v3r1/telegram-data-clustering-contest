        <b>Noel Whelan has told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_leeds">BBC Radio Leeds</a> (broadcast on 23/11 from 17:00) that Leeds United’s performance in their 2-1 win at Luton may not have been spectacular, but it was another example of how Marcelo Bielsa’s side simply do not give up. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The two sides played out a goalless first-half at Kenilworth Road. Leeds came closest to breaking the deadlock before the break. Patrick Bamford hit the woodwork for the visitors.</p>

      <p>It was Bamford who did open the scoring early on in the second-half. Ben White broke out from the back and set the striker up. However, the lead did not last long.</p>
      <p>Izzy Brown came back to haunt the club he spent last year with on loan. The Chelsea loanee produced a superb cross for James Collins for the equaliser.</p>

      <p>Leeds took a long time to recover from the goal. Luton had a goal disallowed for offside and were certainly on top for a large part of the second-half.</p>
      <p>Bielsa’s men did eventually respond. Luton were grateful to goalkeeper James Shea for ensuring that the visitors could not find a winning goal until the final moments. He made some superb saves, with Pablo Hernandez amongst those to be denied by the stopper.</p>
      <p>The winner came in stoppage-time with Mateusz Klich’s cross being turned in as Bamford and Matty Pearson battled for the ball. With Preston North End losing, Leeds have moved back into the Championship’s top two.</p>
      <p>And after the game, Whelan offered his thoughts on Leeds’s performance and the result.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t any kind of spectacular performance here by Leeds. But how many times have we said that this season? They keep grinding it out, they keep digging in. And that determination and heart saw them through in the end,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_leeds">he told BBC Radio Leeds</a>.</p>
