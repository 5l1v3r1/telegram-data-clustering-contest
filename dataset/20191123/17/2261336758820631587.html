      <p>We are just hours away from the WBC heavyweight title rematch between Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KOs) and Luis Ortiz (31-1-2 NCs, 26 KOs). Wilder is expected to rematch Tyson Fury in early 2020, in what would be a much bigger matchup than this one, but “The Bronze Bomber” must first get past the man who gave him a major scare in their first matchup.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, Wilder and Ortiz fought at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, NY. After a slow-paced start, Wilder scored a fifth-round knockdown, and usually that means the end is near. Instead, “King Kong” fought back and rocked Wilder badly in round seven, putting him on the verge of a knockdown but failing to get him on the canvas or get a standing TKO. Wilder had the final say, knocking Ortiz down multiple times in the 10th round for the most dramatic win of his career.</p>
      <p>As we await the big rematch, you can watch the full video at the top of the page and relive what was one of the most incredible bouts of 2018.</p>
      <p>Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz 2 airs live on FOX Sports PPV at 9 PM ET/6 PM PT from MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada on Saturday, November 23rd. Main event start time is expected for around 12 AM ET/9 PM PT.</p>
