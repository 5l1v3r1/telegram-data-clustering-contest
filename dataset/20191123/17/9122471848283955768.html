      <h1>Paul Finebaum Makes His Prediction For Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:56:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a season-ending injury. The Alabama star rolled away from two Mississippi State defenders when he was tackled awkwardly.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa suffered a dislocated hip, which also resulted in a small fracture as well.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the hit, fans and football analysts alike wondered if he’d ever play football again. however, after undergoing surgery, doctors released a positive prognosis for the star quarterback.</p>
      <p>Doctors expect him to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, ESPN’s Paul Finebaum made his prediction for whether or not Tua will enter his name into the NFL draft.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Finebaum had to say, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Tua-Tagovailoa-NFL-Draft-decision-predicted-by-Paul-Finebaum-Alabama-Crimson-Tide-139041718/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I think he’s going to come out. I’ve heard arguments on both sides, and they both make a lot of sense. For a guy that could have gone, probably, first in the draft last year, it’s a long time to sit there and see all the money go passed. … Last Saturday, a lot of us were looking at our phones, looking at our televisions wondering if he would ever play football again. Today, we’re debating whether he’ll be at the middle or the bottom of the first round. That’s a big leap.”</blockquote>
      <p>Tagovailoa was expected to be taken near the top of the first round in the 2020 NFL draft.</p>
      <p>Scouts won’t know about Tua’s health for a few months, which could cloud his stock moving forward.</p>
