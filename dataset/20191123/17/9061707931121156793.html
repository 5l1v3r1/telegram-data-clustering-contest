      <h1>'Fortress' - Derby County fans are all saying the same thing after Preston win</h1>
      <h2>Derby County 1-0 Preston North End | A Martyn Waghorn goal secured all three points for the Rams at Pride Park Stadium</h2>

      <p>Derby County got back to winning ways on Saturday as they claimed a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-preston-live-score-3569585">1-0 win over Preston North End</a> in the Sky Bet Championship.</p>
      <p>A first half goal from substitute <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-player-ratings-preston-forsyth-3571274">Martyn Waghorn</a> was enough for the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>to secure all three points at Pride Park Stadium.</p>
      <p>The victory means that Derby have now won their last five league matches at home, and Phillip Cocu’s side have now moved up to 11th place in the Championship table.</p>
      <p>After the final whistle, Rams fans took to social media to express their thoughts and emotions on the result and their side’s performance.</p>
      <p>Here is a selection of what they had to say.</p>
      <p><b>Jason Burns:</b> “How lovely to see super fozzy back in a rams shirt!”</p>
      <p><b>Daniel Bell:</b> “Brill game.”</p>
      <p><b>Soph:</b> “Nice to see Derby creeping slowly up that table! Up the Rams.”</p>
      <p><b>PRF:</b> “We get better every week, we’ll mount a promotion push.”</p>
      <p><b>Andrew:</b> “Good decision to not play Marriott. Clear that the management staff identified it was going to be a physical game and didn’t want Jack bullied by the big lads. Keep him fresh and go again.”</p>
      <p><b>Stephen:</b> “Don't know how Fozzy manages to do it. Injury after injury and looks better than ever.”</p>
      <p><b>Ashley Woodhouse:</b> “Fortress!”</p>
      <p><b>Harry:</b> “Big win! Bielik really beginning to prove his worth.”</p>
