      <h1>Doubt cast on Alistair Coe's ability to lead the Canberra Liberals to a win in 2020 election</h1>

      <p>Incumbent Canberra Liberals leader Alistair Coe could be replaced before the election, according to sources close to the party room.</p>

      <p>Senior ACT Liberal figures confirmed discussions are taking place to canvas the option of a different leadership team, with Elizabeth Lee as leader and Giulia Jones mooted as a possible candidate for deputy.</p>
      <p>It is understood that several MLAs have been involved in conversations about changing the leadership.</p>
      <p>"She's the one people think can most likely win government for the Canberra Liberals," one source said of Ms Lee.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Coe told the <i>Sunday Canberra Times</i> he would not be giving up the leadership.</p>
      <p>He said he had a "stable and professional" team.</p>
      <p>"Leadership speculation is a perennial feature of political parties everywhere," Mr Coe said.</p>
      <p>"We know that under the Hare Clark system it is especially easy for voters to punish individual members who are seen to cause instability."</p>
      <p>It is understood the situation has been brewing for months. While background conversations have been ongoing, Liberal Members of the Legislative Assembly have been counting the numbers in recent days.</p>
      <p>Sources said the discussions had turned from disquiet to serious consideration for the change, with less than 12 months until the territory election.</p>
      <p>As the October 17, 2020 election date edges closer, any change becomes more and more unfeasible, the sources said.</p>
      <p>One source said while the party liked Mr Coe as a person, he was an electoral liability.</p>
      <p>"I don't think we can win with Alistair as leader," the source said.</p>
      <p>Mr Coe hit back, saying with him as leader, the Canberra Liberals were ready to tackle the Labor government in the 2020 election with policies, candidates and funds.</p>
      <p>"I am proud of my commitment to freeze rates; the work that I did to expose dodgy land deals that are still under investigation; the establishment of an ICAC; and the fact that the Canberra Liberals will soon have the most diverse team of candidates that the ACT has ever seen."</p>
      <p>Mr Coe, a social conservative, became party leader when moderate Jeremy Hanson was ousted following the Canberra Liberals loss at the 2016 territory election.</p>
      <p>Public sentiment at the time was that the election was finally in the grasp of the Liberals, as the Labor government had held power for 15 years.</p>
      <p>The 2020 election will see the Liberals looking to wrest power from the Labor government after 19 years in opposition. The ACT has been a self-governing territory for 30 years.</p>
