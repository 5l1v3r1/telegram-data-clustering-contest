      <h1>Urban Meyer Reveals His Score Prediction For Ohio State-Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:14:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, the biggest game of the college football weekend was set to kick off from Columbus. No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn state in a match-up of College Football Playoff contenders.</p>
      <p>Just a few hours before they were scheduled to kick off, Ohio State and Penn State players decided to get the party started a little early. Over an hour before kickoff, players from both teams met a mid-field to share their distaste for one another.</p>
      <p>Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer issued an ominous message to Penn State’s players before the game. “Be careful what you wish for,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meyer later revealed his score prediction for the game. He thinks Ohio State is going to blow the doors off of Penn State this afternoon.</p>
      <p>He likes Ohio State to win 42-20.</p>
