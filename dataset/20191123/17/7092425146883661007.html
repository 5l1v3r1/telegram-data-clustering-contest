      <h1>Liverpool player ratings as Roberto Firmino proves pivotal</h1>

        <b>It's now 30 games unbeaten in the Premier League for Liverpool – but this was anything but a three-point walk in Selhurst Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, Jurgen Klopp’s runaway leaders are only the fifth top-flight side to have managed such an unchecked sequence since 1992-93. They need to avoid defeat next week at home to Brighton to equal the club’s longest unbeaten run set between May 1987 and March 1988.</p>
      <p>Yet had VAR official Chris Kavanagh not deemed Jordan Ayew’s push on Dejan Lovren a foul – and disallowed James Tomkins’ 43 rd -minute far-post strike as a result – it might have been a very different story.</p>
      <p>The Reds, eight points clear before kick-off, had actually started brightly before Roy Hodgson’s Eagles took a firm grip for the rest of the opening period.</p>
      <p>Klopp probably read the riot act to his misfiring Merseysiders at the interval. Whatever the German said, it did the trick as soon after Sadio Mane’s mis-hit strike somehow slipped past home keeper Guiata to break the deadlock.</p>
      <p>And even when Wilfried Zaha levelled after 82 minutes, these never-say-die table-toppers hit back through Roberto Firmino’s fine finish two minutes later.</p>

        <b>RATINGS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Alisson:</b> The Brazilian was dressed like the man in black but, after VAR came to Liverpool’s rescue at the end of the opening period, he was celebrating rather than mourning. Had a busy second half as Liverpool again failed to keep a clean sheet.<b> 7</b></p>
      <p><b>Trent Alexander-Arnold:</b> Sloppy would be the best way to describe the Englishman’s opening 30 minutes. One wayward cross-field pass, meant for Robertson, almost led to a shock Palace breakthrough for and completely changed the momentum. Can be much better. <b>5</b></p>
      <p><b>Dejan Lovren:</b> One brilliant interception in the first half to deny Ayew demonstrated why the Croatian is keeping Joe Gomez out of the team. The defender then went down from Ayew’s shove, albeit theatrically, to convince VAR to chalk off Tomkins’ effort.<b> 7</b></p>
      <p><b>Virgil van Dijk:</b> The Dutch maestro probably felt he was in for relaxing stroll in south London during the first 15 minutes of relentless Liverpool possession. It proved otherwise, but along with Lovren, he stood tall and firm. <b>7.</b></p>
      <p><b>Andy Robertson:</b> Overlapping runs, of course, were a prominent feature but the Scottish left-back also had plenty of defending too with Andros Townsend and Zaha in a very lively mood.<b> 7</b></p>
      <p><b>Jordan Henderson:</b> Driving force, as ever, in the heart of the Liverpool engine room, the skipper was always looking to provide a moment of inspiration to those ahead. Almost did that with one delicious 20 th minute chip. Subbed for Milner after 79 minutes. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Fabinho:</b> The silky Brazilian struggled for much of the first half – like most of his team-mates to be fair – but still kept the Reds ticking alongside Henderson. A tough afternoon but emerged relatively unscathed. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Georginio Wijnaldum:</b> Dutchman was often the extra man in attack but found it hard to find much space in order to open up Palace’s stubborn rearguard. Decent rather than outstanding. <b>7</b></p>
      <p><b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain:</b> In for Mo Salah, the in-form England man was typically busy without ever hitting the heights seen on recent international duty. Subbed in the 64 th minute for Origi. <b>6</b></p>
      <p><b>Roberto Firmino:</b> The Samba striker was having a quiet day until his exchange of passes with Robertson led to Mane breaking the deadlock immediately after half-time. He then popped up to grab the winner late on before being replaced by Gomez at the death. <b>8</b></p>
      <p><b>Sadio Mane:</b> With better control, the Reds forward would have opened the scoring early on but then made amends with his sixth goal in as many games against Palace – and 29 th of 2019 - at the start of the second period.<b> 7</b></p>
      <p>
