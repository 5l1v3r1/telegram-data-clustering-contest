      <p>One year ago, a tabloid falsely claimed <b>Jennifer Aniston</b> had an emotional breakdown after running into <b>Justin Theroux</b> at a restaurant in Los Angeles. The story was illogical and <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked it as soon as it emerged. 365 days later, it’s even more clear that the ex-spouses are on great terms.</p>
      <p>On November 23, 2018, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out <i>OK!</i> for alleging that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-cried-run-in-restaurant/">Aniston broke down in tears after a surprise run-in with Theroux</a> at an unnamed “Hollywood restaurant.” An alleged insider said the actress was “having a great time with friends” until she spotted her ex, who completely ignored her. The supposed source further maintained that the actress was visibly shaken and told her pals to get the check so they could leave.</p>
      <p>As we noted at the time, there was a major red flag in the story since the tabloid didn’t bother to mention exactly when and where any of this occurred. One would think the outlet’s “source” could provide the name of the restaurant where the incident took place. They didn’t. Still, <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with Aniston’s spokesperson, who told us on the record that the premise was made-up.</p>
      <p>The magazine’s story was published at a time when the exes hadn’t been spotted together for a while. This past July, however, <a href="https://people.com/pets/justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-dog-dolly-dies/">Aniston and Theroux reunited to bury their late dog Dolly</a>. The actor even shared an Instagram photo of him and Aniston holding each other’s hands while laying their dog to rest. As opposed to making her cry at a restaurant, Theroux recently comforted his ex during an emotional farewell to their dog.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a29482483/jennifer-aniston-instagram-justin-theroux-celebrities-reaction/">Theroux was one of the first celebrities to follow Aniston on Instagram</a> when she joined the platform last month. The actor wrote “Woot-woot” along with a raised hands and heart emoji on her very first post. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4jhVPGpPMa/">Theroux tagged Aniston in an Instagram post</a> encouraging people to adopt rescue dogs. After including her name in the post, the actor added, “yep, now that you’re on here, your gonna get this a lot too,” along with a smiley face. Simply put, the exes have remained close friends following their breakup. There was no surprise run-in at a restaurant one year ago, but should Aniston ever run into her ex randomly, she won’t cry and run away.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately,<i> OK!</i> continued creating fake drama between the exes in the months that followed. This past April, <b>Gossip Cop</b> called out the magazine for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-kiss-woman/">Aniston was heartbroken after Theroux was photographed kissing another woman</a>. The story was absurd for many reasons, but especially because the actor was kissing Ilana Glazer while shooting a scene for their upcoming movie <i>False Positive</i>. The tabloids can’t accept the idea of ex-spouses getting along, so they come up with these bogus narratives instead.</p>
