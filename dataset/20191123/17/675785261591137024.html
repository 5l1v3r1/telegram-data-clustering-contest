      <p>‘Ang abaht… one-fifth of Brits admit changing their accents at work to appear more professional.</p>
      <p>Londoners are the worst, along with career-minded Glaswegians who row back on their dialect in case people dinnae understand them.</p>
      <p>A poll found 44 per cent of office staff are self-conscious about the way they speak at work. And 13 per cent didn’t realise they were putting on a posh accent until a friend told them.</p>
      <p>Staff feel more self-conscious on the phone, with 27 per cent “speaking proper” on the blower.</p>

      <p>And 20 per cent say they change their voice in meetings to appear more authoritative.</p>
      <p>After London and Glasgow – on 21 per cent – 17 per cent of Manchester folk got all mithered about their accent, while the same number did in Brizzle… sorry, Bristol.</p>
      <p>Telecoms firm 4Com quizzed 1,002 UK office workers.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Mark Pearcy said: “This is a form of impression management strategy, to make them sound more professional, educated or of a higher class.</p>
      <p>"It’s a shame. Accent variety is one of the things that makes our country great."</p>
