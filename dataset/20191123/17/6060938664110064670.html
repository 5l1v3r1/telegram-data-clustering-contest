      <p>KOLKATA: Two more Bangladesh batsmen sustained sickening blows to the helmet on Saturday, raising questions about the visibility of the pink ball used for their maiden day-night Test against India at Kolkata's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>.</p>
      <p>The tourists, facing a heavy defeat, were already grappling with a personnel crisis after <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Liton-Das">Liton Das</a> and Nayeem Hasan were hit on the head by short deliveries from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammed Shami</a> in their first innings on Friday.</p>
      <p>That forced Bangladesh to bring in Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam as concussion substitutes.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Mohammad Mithun was smacked on the helmet by an <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a> delivery, while Mushfiqur Rahim, whose unbeaten 59 helped them avoid a defeat inside two days, was hit by an <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> lifter.</p>
      <p>"I thought lights and pink ball had a role to play," India's top order batsman Cheteshwar Pujara said after the second day.</p>
      <p>"For a batsman, it's not easy to pick the ball, especially short balls considering the kind of pace our fast bowlers have.</p>
      <p>"Their batters, as far as I know, have not played any first class game with pink ball. So it's not easy.</p>
      <p>"First session is slightly easier to bat. Under lights, the ball starts swinging a little more. It's easier to see the ball in sunlight, whether it's red or pink."</p>
      <p>Bangladesh finished day two on 152/6, needing to score 89 more to make India bat against and avoid an innings defeat. India are 1-0 up in the two-Test series.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh quick Al-Amin Hossain, however, dismissed suggestions that the tourists were not technically equipped to deal with the pink ball.</p>
      <p>"I don't think there is any problem with the technique of our batsmen," he said. "One can always get hit in the head. I don't think visibility is an issue either, because when I batted, I had no problem seeing the ball."</p>
      <p>Compounding Bangladesh's problem, Mahmudullah, who made a gutsy 39 and resisted India's victory charge during a dour partnership with Mushfiqur, had to retire hurt with a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>"Mahmudullah will be assessed again tomorrow. We're hoping he will be able to bat," a team spokesman said, adding that neither Mithun nor Mushfiqur had shown any initial symptoms of concussion.</p>
