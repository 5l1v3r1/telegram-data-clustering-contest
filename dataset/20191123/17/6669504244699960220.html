      <p>A special weather statement warning of flurries and freezing rain has ended.</p>
      <p>According to Environment Canada, flurries and a risk of freezing rain were in the Saturday morning forecast for much of the Interior, including the North and Central Okanagan as well as North and South Thompson areas. The special weather statement also applied to the Shuswap, Boundary and Similkameen.</p>
      <p>"Flurries are expected this morning. The warm air aloft combined with near or below zero temperatures at the surface will result in a risk of freezing rain. The flurries with the risk of freezing rain will change to showers this afternoon as temperatures rise above zero," the original statement reads.</p>
      <p>"Surfaces such as highways, roads, walkways and parking lots may become icy and slippery. Take extra caution when walking or driving in affected areas."</p>
      <p>While the flurries and freezing rain has been called off, the snow warning on the Trans-Canada remains.</p>
      <p>Heavy snowfall is ahead for the Trans-Canada Highway from Eagle Pass to Rogers Pass with 15 to 25 centimetres of snow expected Saturday. Environment Canada said the snowfall will ease to a few lingering flurries Sunday morning.</p>
