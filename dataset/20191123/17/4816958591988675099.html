      <p>Federal Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has dismissed two of his most senior staff in the wake of his partyâ€™s recent election loss.</p>
      <p>In a letter sent out Saturday morning, Scheer announced that Chief of Staff Marc-Andre Leclerc and Communications Director Brock Harrison have been let go effective immediately.</p>
      <p>Martin Belanger and Simon Jefferies will act as interim chief of staff and director of communications, respectively, until permanent replacements are found.</p>

      <p>Scheer did not spell out reasons for the dismissals, but they come as the party wrestles with the aftermath of what many see as a disappointing election outcome.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives were unable to make electoral gains in Quebec and Ontario necessary to form government, despite running neck-and-neck with the Liberals throughout the campaign.</p>
      <p>The party gained seats in the Oct. 21 vote, but still forms the official opposition in the minority parliament.</p>
