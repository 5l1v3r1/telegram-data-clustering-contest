      <p>Resource-rich Australia’s ties with its most important trading partner China have deteriorated in recent years, amid accusations that Beijing is meddling in domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>“These are very disturbing reports,” said Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, adding that government law agencies were dealing with the matter.</p>
      <p>The defector, named as Wang “William” Liqiang by the Age newspaper, gave a sworn statement to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), identifying China’s senior military intelligence officers in Hong Kong, the newspaper said.</p>
      <p>He has also purportedly revealed details of how China funds and conducts political interference in Taiwan and Australia, the Age reported.</p>
      <p>Police in China’s financial hub of Shanghai, responding to the Australian report, said Wang was a 26-year-old unemployed man from the eastern province of Fujian and was wanted in connection with a fraud case.</p>
      <p>On April 10, he went to Hong Kong carrying a fraudulent Chinese passport and Hong Kong permanent residency card, they added in a brief statement.</p>
      <p>Wang had previously been convicted of fraud in 2016 in Fujian, Shanghai police said.</p>
      <p>Reuters reported before Australia’s election in May that Australian intelligence had determined China was responsible for a cyber-attack on its national parliament and three largest political parties. China denies the accusations.</p>
      <p>Wang said he was a part of an intelligence operation within a Hong Kong-listed company that infiltrated universities and media, the Age said.</p>
      <p>“I have personally been involved and participated in a series of espionage activities,” it cited Wang as saying in his October statement to the intelligence agency.</p>
      <p>The ASIO declined to comment, saying only that it did not comment on operational matters or individuals.</p>
      <p>Wang also said there were plans by China to disrupt the presidential vote on the self-ruled island of Taiwan next year, the Age added.</p>
      <p>Taiwan’s presidential office said the government was investigating. A spokeswoman for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party called the information in Australian media a reminder of the threat from China.</p>
      <p>“Whether it is the Chinese internet army or the Chinese government, it is using the democratic system of Taiwan to infringe upon our democracy,” Lee Yen-jong said.</p>
      <p>China considers Taiwan a wayward province and has never ruled out the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control.</p>
      <p>Han Kuo-yu, the presidential candidate of Taiwan’s main opposition, the China-friendly Kuomintang party, urged the government to immediately send a team to Australia to investigate.</p>
      <p>Wang also gave Australia details of the kidnapping of a Hong Kong bookseller taken to the mainland and interrogated on suspicion of selling dissident materials, the paper said.</p>
