          <b>The slide was led by double-digit drops in <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/m-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Macy’s</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/kss-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Kohl’s</a>.</b>

      <p>Big third-quarter earnings misses by retailers over the last week are dragging on the entire retail industry before the holiday season.</p>
      <p>Double-digit stock price slides from <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/m-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Macy’s</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/kss-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Kohl’s</a> weighed on the S&amp;P 500 Retail Index, which lost as much as 4% this week. The S&amp;P 500 index has only fallen as much as 0.2% in the same period.</p>
      <p>Weak sales, disappointing earnings, and lowered full-year profit forecasts led declines. It was the second time this year that Kohl’s and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/hd-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;amp;utm_medium=ingest">Home Depot</a> have lowered earnings expectations, which is not a good sign going into the holidays, the busiest and most important season for retailers.</p>
      <p>In 2018, the holiday season contributed to a strong end of the year <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/holiday-sales-were-break-from-retail-apocalypse-2018-1">for retailers such as Target, Lululemon, American Eagle, and Kohl’s</a>. But the year-end boost hasn’t totally translated into success in 2019 – companies such as Sears, Kmart, and Walmart have had to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stores-closing-in-2019-list-2019-3">shut stores in the ongoing retail apocalypse</a>.</p>
      <p>Not all recent earnings have disappointed. Retailers <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/target-stock-price-gains-retail-solid-q3-earnings-raised-guidance-2019-11-1028704218">Target,</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/gap-inc-gps-reports-q3-2019-earnings-beat-shares-rise.html">Gap</a>, and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/walmart-stock-gains-on-strong-third-quarter-earnings-report-2019-11-1028689455">Walmart</a> posted third-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations.</p>
      <p>But, those reports and subsequent stock gains weren’t enough to lift the struggling industry as a whole. The S&amp;P 500 Retail Index has gained only slightly more than 5% year-to-date, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained nearly 24%.</p>
      <p>Here are the key numbers from three companies that lowered full-year profit outlooks, and how much the stock has been affected:</p>
