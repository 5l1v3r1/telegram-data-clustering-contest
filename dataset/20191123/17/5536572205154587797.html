      <p>What a great last night in Los Angeles as the Clippers and Rockets did battle with each other for the second time during the season.</p>
      <p>During the 4th quarter, foul trouble would plague both teams as Patrick Beverley saw his night end with six fouls and eventually Russell Westbrook would catch his sixth foul.</p>
      <p>Both players have a long history with disliking each other and it kept up when Pat Bev mocked Westbrook and his shot while Russ called him ‘trash’ several times.</p>
