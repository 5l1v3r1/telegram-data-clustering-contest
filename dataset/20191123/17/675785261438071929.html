      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:19:53+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Saira Khan, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Thomas had a glittering sporting ­career but it’s now that he’s doing the most ­important work of his life.</p>
      <p>The former Welsh rugby player is on a ­mission to save lives and change attitudes.</p>
      <p>Gareth opened up on Loose Women this week in his first TV interview since he chose to reveal his HIV status in the Sunday Mirror in September.</p>
      <p>Sitting next to him, I could only imagine how hard it was for him to come out about his sexuality, especially because he was a rugby star.</p>
      <p>He was afraid of losing his people, his town, his game.</p>
      <p>But in 2009, he came out as gay and the following year was voted the most ­influential gay person in the UK.</p>
      <p>It was during a routine health check-up that Gareth discovered he was HIV positive. And it felt like an express train was hitting him at 300mph.</p>

      <p>He wondered how long he had left. He admitted he was so ­uneducated, all he was picturing was the adverts from 20 years ago, with people dying.</p>
      <p>He even thought he wouldn’t be able to share a cup with anybody else.</p>
      <p>The scariest thing for him was that he’d had no symptoms – he seemed fit and healthy. So he is even more determined that people get tested – because Gareth says the fear of not knowing is far worse.</p>
      <p>So many of us still, in 2019, are clueless about HIV. I grew up in the 80s when scaremongering was at its peak.</p>
      <p>The perception was that this virus only affected the gay and African communities and it was a death sentence.</p>
      <p>It is only through Gareth that I learned how far HIV medication has actually come.</p>
      <p>Gareth, who is 45, takes one pill a day now and the virus is ­undetectable in his blood and can’t be passed on.</p>
      <p>He says: “I know I have HIV, but HIV doesn’t have me.”</p>
      <p>He told me that now he has accepted his condition, he feels more empowered and mentally stronger than at any other time in his life.</p>
      <p>And because he has shared his news, he feels the burden has lifted – he doesn’t need to hide and he can now help others.</p>
      <p>And getting tested is such an easy process – you can even get self-test-ing kits to do at home.</p>
      <p>Gareth started off as a rugby player but he is now an educator – out to save lives.</p>
      <p>He’s making HIV less scary and something we should all talk about. He speaks bravely from the heart, he cares and he wants to make a difference.</p>
      <p>After everything he has been through, he is standing tall, owning it and being completely selfless.</p>
      <p>He is proof that having HIV does not make you weak – it makes you the opposite.</p>
