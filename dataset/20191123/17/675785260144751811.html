      <p>If you weren’t scared of dodgy phone calls before, you certainly were after watching Channel 5’s gripping four-parter Cold Call.</p>
      <p>I’m never answering an unknown number again.</p>
      <p>Cold calls used to be an occasional nuisance we moaned about.</p>
      <p>“Oh someone’s trying to sell us double glazing love, get rid of them.” Now it’s more sinister.</p>
      <p>In the thriller, ex-Corrie star Sally Lindsay plays June Clarke, a carer in desperate need of cash to support her pregnant daughter.</p>
      <p>After losing her job, she decides to sell the house.</p>

      <p>But in an astonishing scene in the first 10 minutes, June is scammed out of £83,000.</p>
      <p>I was hooked, watching both sides of the call with my mouth open, because we all know this really happens.</p>
      <p>Phone banking scammer Aubrey, played by Dan Skinner, put on a masterclass in deceit.</p>
      <p>And he taught colleagues tricks of the trade: use friendly accents, from the North-east or Wales, notice the details, is she distracted, a people pleaser?</p>
      <p>He told her she had to act fast, that he was doing her a favour. It was terrifying how easy it was.</p>
      <p>We’ve all been flummoxed by people who call from the bank or HMRC.</p>
      <p>The endless security questions: mother’s maiden name, first pet, favourite colour, school, street, pub, what you had for breakfast on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>It’s enough to baffle even the savviest. It’s a brilliant premise and the mini-series just got more tense and outrageous.</p>
      <p>At a scamming support group, June bumps into old pal Des, played by Dan Ryan, who has spent years super sleuthing to catch out scammers.</p>
      <p>It was great to see the Mount Pleasant couple back together. They have brilliant on-screen chemistry.</p>
      <p>The script was pacy and the action kept moving, from discovering con artist Kirk Wiley, played by Paul Higgins, to June working for him and picking up clues.</p>
      <p>Next thing we know, June murders Aubrey with a lethal injection and kidnaps Wiley’s ailing mum.</p>
      <p>Well that escalated quickly.</p>

      <p>The whole sorry saga ends with the head honcho floating dead in a swimming pool, while a rainbow unicorn dinghy lurked ominously in the background.</p>
      <p>Des doesn’t fare too well but June gets £100,000 and books herself a first class ticket to Barbados.</p>
      <p>With viewers flocking to social media to discuss cold calling dangers, this drama has done us all a favour.</p>
      <p>I wonder what other public service TV shows we could have?</p>
      <p>A comedy on how to put your bins out? A thriller on how to apply for PPI?</p>
      <p>Anyone want to write a drama telling us the ending of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> ?</p>
      <p>All life’s lessons through the power of television, I’m totally here for it.</p>
