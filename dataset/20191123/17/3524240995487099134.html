      <p>Kayode Idowu, Maiduguri</p>
      <p>Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara has deployed 150 Cameroonian vigilantes to flush out remnants of Boko Haram from his state.</p>
      <p>The newly-engaged Cameroonians are to collaborate with Nigerian hunters and vigilantes currently assisting the military in the ongoing battle against Boko Haram in parts of northern Borno.</p>
      <p>The Cameroonians, who are mainly from the Kesh-Kesh vigilante group, were presented with four surveillance vehicles and other fighting equipment on Saturday at a brief ceremony in Damasak, headquarters of Mobbar Local Government Area, on the fringes of the Lake Chad.</p>
      <p>Conducting the ceremony were Borno State commissioner for local governments and emirate affairs, Sugun Mai-Mele and a member of the Borno State House of Assembly, representing Mobbar State constituency, Usman Moruma and other officials of the State Government.</p>
      <p>The governor, who had expressed his willingness to fight insurgency in the State had in August ordered the recruitment of thousands of hunters and vigilantes from different parts of northern Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He had also supported the militaryâ€™s deradicalisation and reintegration of repentant insurgents programme.</p>
