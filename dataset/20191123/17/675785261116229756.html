      <h1>Arsenal player ratings v Southampton as the Gunners' winless run continues</h1>
      <h2>The Frenchman's 96th minute strike rescued a point for Arsenal but it is now six games since the Gunners have recorded a win in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:08:12+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette scored at the death to earn Arsenal a point against Southampton but they were still booed off by a frustrated Emirates crowd.</p>
      <p>Ryan Bertrand's quick free-kick caught out the Gunners defence on eight minutes and Danny Ings fired <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> in front.</p>
      <p>Lacazette levelled in the 18th minute, though, after strike partner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's shot was blocked by Bertrand.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang and Nicolas Pepe had good chances at the start of the second half for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> but were wasteful, and James Ward-Prowse made them pay with a 71st minute strike after his penalty was saved.</p>
      <p>But Lacazette had the final say when he met Gabriel Martinelli's deep cross.</p>
      <p>Here are the full ratings for the game:</p>

      <h3>Arsenal</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Bernd Leno 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did well to save a penalty but could do little about the rebound</p>
      <p>
        <b>Callum Chambers 4</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not his best game and he was hooked for Pepe at half-time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sokratis 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Silly booking for arguing with referee and looked shaky on occasion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>David Luiz 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Didn't do too much wrong but didn't stand out and switched off for goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hector Bellerin 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Could have offered more going forward. Still doesn't look fully fit.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Lucas Torreira 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Booked yet again and ineffective in the middle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Matteo Guendouzi 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not his best game, failed to offer much in truth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kieran Tierney 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Always an attacking threat down the left hand side but clumsy to give away a penalty.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mesut Ozil 5</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pretty quiet, didn't do much to convince Emery he is worth a place in team.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alexandre Lacazette 9 MOTM</b>
      </p>
      <p>Took his two goals well and was dangerous throughout. Saved his side right at the death</p>

      <p>
        <b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not his best game but still occasionally threatened and should have scored in the second-half.</p>
      <p><b>Subs</b> : Nicolas Pepe <b>6</b> for Callum Chambers (45) , Joe Willock for Torreira (83), Gabriel Martinelli for Bellerin (83)</p>
      <h3>Southampton</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Alex McCarthy 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Made a number of good saves in the second half to keep his side in the game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cedric Soares 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did his job with minimal fuss.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jan Bednarek 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Was solid with Stephens to restrict Arsenal's threat.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Jack Stephens 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good partnership with Bednarek to frustrate the Gunners.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ryan Bertrand 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Always lively down the left hand side and set up first goal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>James Ward-Prowse 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tidy as ever with a wicked delivery. Coolly tucked away his goal after missing the penalty</p>

      <p>
        <b>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Did well to deal with Arsenal's front men running at him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stuart Armstrong 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fairly quiet, didn't offer as much as the rest of Saints' midfield.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nathan Redmond 7</b>
      </p>
      <p>Terrified the Arsenal defence a number of times with his direct running.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Danny Ings 8</b>
      </p>
      <p>Took his chance coolly and had another few efforts.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Michael</b>
        <b>Obfaemi 6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Posed a threat but occasionally chose the wrong option and was subbed with ten minutes to go</p>
      <p><b>Subs</b> : Shane Long for Ings (73), Moussa Djenepo for Obafemi (76)</p>
