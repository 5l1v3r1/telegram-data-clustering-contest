        <b>Preston North End's four-match unbeaten run was halted by Derby County as once again Pride Park proved an unhappy ground.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lilywhites have now gone 13 games without a win against the Rams, a sequence going back to 2008.</p>

      <p>Derby's winner came in the 33rd minute, substitute Martyn Waghorn netting from close range after a corner was flicked on.</p>
      <p>That was no more than the home side's play had deserved, with them well on top in the first half.</p>
      <p>Declan Rudd had twice saved in one-on-one situations, while Duane Holmes hit the bar.</p>
      <p>North End were better in the second half, helped by the half-time introductions of Paul Gallagher and Billy Bodin.</p>
      <p>But while they saw more of the ball, Alex Neil's men didn't create a great deal in terms of scoring chances.</p>
      <p>They did have the ball in the net from a corner but the offside flag went up against Tom Barkhuizen.</p>
      <p>Neil had made two changes to the side which had beaten Huddersfield before the international break, Ben Pearson and Daniel Johnson returning to midfield after suspension and injury respectively - Gallagher and Ryan Ledson dropped to the bench to accommodate them.</p>
      <p>Derby were on top from the start in the first half, Tom Lawrence drilling an early shot from 25 yards wide of the target.</p>
      <p>North End won a free-kick in the 10th minute when Sean Maguire was tripped to the left of the box.</p>
      <p>Alan Browne squared it to Johnson in the box, his shot hitting team-mate Patrick Bauer in a crowded goalmouth.</p>
      <p>Bauer was first to react to the loose ball but turned and scooped a shot over the bar from 10 yards.</p>
      <p>The home side struck the woodwork in the 17th minute, Lawrence getting away down the left and feeding a pass to Chris Martin just outside the box.</p>
      <p>Martin flicked the ball up to Holmes who hit a first-time shot which hit the top of the bar and bounced over.</p>
      <p>Soon after Lawrence got clear of the Preston defence but Rudd came to the rescue, pushing his low shot behind for a corner.</p>
      <p>Jayden Stockley sent a volley from 20 yards just wide of the far post but there was precious little seen going forward in the first half.</p>
      <p>Lawrence saw a free-kick blocked by Pearson in the wall, Darnell Fisher having been booked for bringing down Mason Bennett.</p>
      <p>In the process Bennett was injured and was replaced soon after by Waghorn who had only been on the pitch a short time when he gave Derby the lead.</p>
      <p>He had already gone close when played through on goal, Rudd managing to spread himself and get enough on the shot to take it over the bar.</p>
      <p>The goal came in the 33rd minute, Lawrence's corner from the left flicked on by Curtis Davies for Waghorn to knock the ball over the line from close range - there a suspicion of handball against the Rams striker.</p>
      <p>Neil made a double change at the interval, Fisher and Stockley getting the hook with Gallagher and Bodin joining the fray.</p>
      <p>Browne moved to right-back, with Gallagher partnering Pearson in midfield. Johnson switched forward to the No.10 role behind Barkhuizen in the central striker's position.</p>
      <p>The changes certainly injected some tempo into PNE's play and they looked better for it.</p>
      <p>That said they nearly got caught on the break in the 55th minute when Waghorn got played through on goal by a cross field pass but he out his shot too close to Rudd who saved comfortably.</p>
      <p>North End had the ball in the net when Barkhuizen got the last touch on a shot from Davies after a corner but the flag went up for offside against him.</p>
      <p>Rams right-back Jayden Bogle tricked inside from the wing and hit a shot across goal which flew just wide of the far post.</p>
      <p>In the 69th minute Gallagher delivered a free-kick from the right channel into the box, Rams keeper Kelle Roos punching clear.</p>
      <p>It fell to Johnson who saw his hooked volley blocked by a defender six yards out.</p>
      <p>Preston were dealt an injury blow when Ben Davies was forced off a few minutes after needing treatment.</p>
      <p>Jordan Storey replaced him in the centre of defence but it meant the planned introduction of David Nugent to the attack was prevented - Nugent had moments earlier been given the nod to get ready to come on.</p>
      <p>Although on for his defensive attributes, Storey nearly found the net when his shot from a tight angle hit the outside of the post, his initial header having been blocked.</p>
      <p>Late on, Barkhuizen put a shot too high and Johnson fired over, the ball never quite falling for Preston when it mattered.</p>
