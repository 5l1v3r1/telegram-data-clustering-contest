      <h1>Thrustme, Spacety report initial success of cold gas thruster</h1>

      <p>BREMEN, Germany – Spacety and  ThrustMe reported success in initial on-orbit testing of an iodine-fueled cubesat thruster at the Space Tech Expo Europe here.</p>
      <p>“It all operates as expected but we cannot give you data on the performance because we have just thrusted a little bit,” ThrustMe CEO Ane Aanesland told <i>SpaceNews</i>.</p>
      <p>ThrustMe’s I2T5 cold gas thruster, a spinout from the French startup’s electric propulsion work, performed the first propulsive operations Nov. 18, firing for “a few tens of minutes,” according to a Nov. 19 news release. “All subsystems reported correct operations and thus the commissioning of the thruster was successful.”</p>
      <p>Additional tests of the cold gas thruster for orbital maneuvering are scheduled for sometime in early 2020. First, Spacety, a privately owned Chinese company, plans to test the other payloads on the ten-kilogram cubesat launched November 3.</p>
      <p>ThrustMe is developing small electric propulsion systems powered by iodine and xenon. Late last year, engineers realized the iodine propellant storage subsystem for one of its propulsion systems could become a cold gas thruster, Aanesland said. ThrustMe developed the new product within six weeks and signed the contract with Spacety three months later, she added.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes electric propulsion is overkill for cubesats,” Aanesland said. “Sometimes all they need is propulsion for drag compensation and collision avoidance.”</p>
      <p>In addition to testing the cold gas thruster, Spacety’s cubesat is demonstrating a multispectral imager and laser communications.</p>
      <p>“We had planned to do the propulsive operations after all the other payloads had been fully tested, so in two to three months,” Feng Yang, Spacety founder and CEO, said in a statement. “But we didn’t have the patience to wait. It was just too exciting to test this historic system as soon as we could.”</p>
      <p>Spacety and ThrustMe executives are enthusiastic about Iodine fuel for small satellites.</p>
      <p>“You can store your propellant without pressurization,” Aanesland said. “You can even send it by plane pre-filled to the customer. Since it’s not pressurized, you can make the propellant tank fit any shape that is available.”</p>
      <p>Dmytro Rafalskyi, ThrustMe chief technology officer, said in a statement, “Iodine has remarkable advantages compared to pressurized gases, but it has also new technical and quite difficult challenges … You cannot just replace the pressurized gas with iodine and think that it will work.”</p>
      <p>James Zheng, Spacety international business vice president, said the firm is proud of the swift pace of the the thruster test.</p>
      <p>“It took us eight months from signing the contract to launching the satellites, and then only 15 days in space to get the first successful data,” he said in a statement.</p>
