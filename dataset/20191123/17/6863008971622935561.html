      <p>Former owner of VAB Bank and owner of one of Ukraine's largest agricultural producers, UkrLandFarming, Oleg Bakhmatyuk, who has been put on the wanted list on charges of embezzling a UAH 1.2 billion (US$49.6 million) stabilization loan from the National Bank of Ukraine, is going to return to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>"I hope [to return to Ukraine] as soon as possible. I have been on the road all my life, but I have absolutely no desire to live somewhere other than Ukraine. But I don't really want to just be 'executed.' I want to have the right to defense, especially since there is a huge structure behind me," he said in an <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10766078-ex-owner-of-vab-bank-oleg-bakhmatyuk-people-in-power-think-they-re-immortal-and-that-they-ll-be-around-for-a-hundred-years-thus-repeating-the-same-mistake-their-predecessors-made.html">interview</a> to UNIAN.</p>
      <p>Bakhmatyuk says he expects to come back in two or three weeks.</p>
      <p>He said the National Anti-corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) had issued papers with charges against him while he was on a working trip to Qatar, the UAE and Geneva in Switzerland, where he was negotiating with U.S. Cargill, Inc, an American privately held global corporation.</p>
      <p>If the talks had been successful, funds from future contracts to would have helped the businessman fulfill the plan to return UAH 8 billion (US$331.2 million) to Ukraine's Deposit Guarantee Fund.</p>
      <p>"We came up with a proposal to the Deposit Guarantee Fund that we would like to repay UAH 8 billion as bona fide shareholders. And I went to negotiate with the buyers of our raw materials – cereals – with Cargill… And when we were already at the final stage, they on Sunday issued a suspicion notice against me, which completely disrupted the course and made the negotiations disadvantageous. We appealed to the president but were not heard. Now this mess is ongoing," Bakhmatyuk said.</p>
      <p>Bakhmatyuk claims he proposed to return the UAH 500 million (US$20.7 million) in a guarantee deposit to the Deposit Guarantee Fund at the stage of paperwork and then annually pay out UAH 1 billion (US$41.3 million) until full settlement.</p>
      <p>"You will see, in three to four months, the Deposit Guarantee Fund will sell the assets of those banks, and how much will it get? 5-10% of their real value? We see stupid demotivation and we cannot understand it," the businessman said.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, on November 22, 2019, the website of the Ministry of the Interior published information on putting ex-owner of VAB Bank and owner of UkrLandFarming Agro Holding Oleg Bakhmatyuk on the wanted list. Earlier, on November 14, NABU detectives informed Bakhmatyuk of a suspicion of embezzling a UAH 1.2 billion stabilization loan granted by the National Bank of Ukraine to VAB Bank.</p>
      <p>Bakhmatyuk is charged with committing crimes under Part 5 of Article 191 (misappropriation, embezzlement of assets or taking possession of them by abuse of office) and Part 3 of Article 209 (legalization (laundering) of funds and other assets of criminal nature) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.</p>
