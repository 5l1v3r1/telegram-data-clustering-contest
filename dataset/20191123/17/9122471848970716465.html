      <h1>Urban Meyer Reacts To Jim Harbaugh’s Season At Michigan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:59:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>It took time for Michigan to establish an identity this season, but Jim Harbaugh finally has his players competing at a high level. In fact, the Wolverines have been so impressive of late that even Urban Meyer had to give them credit.</p>
      <p>Michigan suffered two losses early in the season to Penn State and Wisconsin. The entire team looked flat when it played at Madison back in September.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines even went through growing pains in October, but they’ve responded over the past few weeks with a trio of double-digit victories.</p>
      <p>During FOX’s <i>Big Noon Kickoff</i> show this morning, Meyer praised Harbaugh’s team for its resiliency this season.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Urban-Meyer-compliments-improved-Michigan-Wolverines-football-Jim-Harbaugh-139042687/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“We had them (on FOX) against Army and also against Wisconsin, and I’m not sure I’ve seen a Wolverines team look that defeated, that deflated,” Meyer said. “But you have to give credit to the leaders on that team. This is a very good team. They’re playing excellent defensive football.”</blockquote>
      <p>Meyer isn’t one to shy away from being brutally honest about how he feels when it comes to Michigan football. The fact that he’s commending the team for having a bounce-back season puts into perspective how well the Wolverines have played since their loss to the Nittany Lions.</p>
      <p>Harbaugh has to be proud of his players and the way they’ve responded to adversity this season as well.</p>
      <p>We’ll see if Michigan can continue its winning ways on the road this afternoon against Indiana.</p>
