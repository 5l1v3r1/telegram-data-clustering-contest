      <h1>Talent Dan Ticktum will "probably forget about motorsport" if F1 dream falls apart</h1>

        <b>Former <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> junior Daniel Ticktum has said he would <i>"probably forget about motorsport" </i>should his dream of becoming an F1 driver fall apart, although the young Brit did add a good offer from other racing classes would pique his interest as well.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ticktum, now 20 years of age, was seen as the brightest talent in the Red Bull junior program for years. He was running away with the Formula 3 title last season until Mick Schumacher went on a massive winning streak to end the season, snatching the title away from Ticktum, much to the fury of the latter.</p>
      <p>Joining Super Formula this year, Ticktum was suddenly dropped from both the Super Formula team as well as the Red Bull program altogether, leaving him without a class to drive in for the remainder of this year.</p>

      <p>Widely expected to join Formula 2 team DAMS, who will have two seats available for the 2020 season, Ticktum spoke to <i>Motorsport.com </i>about his future ambitions as he keeps targeting Formula 1 as the end goal.</p>
      <p><i>“We’ve got something sorted [for next year], I can’t go into more detail than that,” </i>the young driver revealed.</p>

        <i>“F1 is the end goal. I’ve been like that since I started going down the single-seater route. </i>
        <i>If I can’t get to F1, I’ll probably – unless I get a very good deal in something else – I’ll probably forget motorsport if I’m honest.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You never know when you’re in the situation, if you don’t get to F1 and you’re given an amazing Formula E contract, you probably wouldn’t turn it down.  </i>
        <i>It’s very different when you’re in the position [being offered something outside of F1], but the end goal is very much Formula 1."</i>
