      <p>R. Kelly’s girlfriend is turning on the singer while he is in jail.</p>
      <p>Joycelyn Savage, an alleged sex slave of R. Kelly who has been living with him since she was 19, is telling her side of the story despite signing an NDA while Kelly is incarcerated for several sex abuse charges across many states.</p>
      <p>In a Patreon page she created to share her story, Savage, 24, recalls what it was like when she first met the singer and how he is allegedly controlling.</p>

      <p>“I am risking my life for many others. This story is 18+ and only for mature audience. I want to make sure my story is very detailed as I can remember,” Savage shared in an Instagram post to highlight her Patreon post.</p>

      <p>Savage recalls when she first met Kelly (who she calls by his first name, Robert, in the post) at a concert and he promised to make her the next Aaliyah. After he flew her out to California, things started to change.</p>
      <p>“Robert would always look at me in a sexual way the first couple of times we met occasionally,” she wrote. “Robert told me soo many lies my 19 year old mind believed everyone of one them.”</p>
      <p>She does admit to falling in love with him in 2015, but he quickly turned controlling and made her call him “master” or “daddy”.</p>
      <p>“It started getting worse by day by day, he would raise his voice at me if I didn’t call him by those two names,” the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Joycelynsavage/posts">post reads</a>. “If Robert called me I would have to reply with ‘Yes, daddy’ or ‘Please daddy’ he was so controlling.”</p>

      <p>Savage was never allowed to enter the basement and one of Kelly’s assistants would watch her at all times, even as she showered. She wrote, “I can say I didn’t have any type of privacy at all now that I think of it. If I showered one of his [assistants] would have to be by the door while I shower. At the moment I kept thinking to myself why is all of this, does he think I will run away? Or go back home. That’s exactly what he thought he didn’t want me to leave at all.”</p>
      <p>Phone calls, including those to her parents, were also monitored.</p>
      <p>Savage’s reports line up with other accounts from alleged sex slaves in the documentary “Surviving R. Kelly”. She has previously said that she was living with the musician on her own accord and that her parent’s claims that he has brainwashed her are false.</p>
      <p>Savage’s parents have not responded to their daughter’s recent report but did retweet an article about her confession.</p>
      <p>Kelly’s attorney, Steven Greenberg, released a statement claiming that Savage is “exploiting” his client.</p>
      <p>“It is unfortunate that Jocelyn now seeks to make money by exploiting her long time, loving relationship with Robert. Obviously if she were to tell the truth no one would pay so she has, unfortunately, chosen to regurgitate the stories and lies told by others for her own personal profit.  We know the real facts, and it was not until the money ran out that she decided anything was wrong. Hopefully people will see it for the Obvious profiteering it is,” Greenberg said.<br/><a href="https://etcanada.com/embed/1570164803705/?autoPlay=false">Watch Video</a></p>
