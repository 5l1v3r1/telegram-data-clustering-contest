      <p>Dejan Lovren helped Liverpool record an away victory against Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon – and some of the club’s supporters on Twitter were impressed by his performance.</p>
      <p>The Reds netted a late winner to earn three more points in the Premier League and maintain their spot at the top of the table.</p>
      <p>Sadio Mane put the Merseyside giants in front early in the first-half at Selhurst Park, before Wilfried Zaha equalised in the 82nd minute.</p>
      <p>But Liverpool’s title credentials were strengthened when Roberto Firmino scored in the 85th minute, as he reacted quickest in the penalty box to fire in the ball.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s side now have 37 points from their opening 13 league matches and stay eight points clear of second-placed Leicester City.</p>

      <p>A selection of Reds supporters on social media felt that Lovren deserved credit for his efforts against Palace.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old was caught out in the build up to Zaha’s equaliser, but aside from that was solid and has started the last four consecutive league games.</p>
      <p>He is a no-nonsense centre-back that put his body the line against Palace and was an imposing figure at the back alongside Virgil Van Dijk.</p>
      <p>Here are some Liverpool fans on Lovren:</p>
