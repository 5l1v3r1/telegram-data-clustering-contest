      <p>In this VladTV Flashback from 2018, Lord Jamar spoke on Boosieâ€™s comments about Kodak not being able to blame anyone but himself for the stuff that has happened to him in the last year. Jamar and Vlad then broke down people who get stardom and ultimately fail back into the streets. Jamar noted that it usually never ends up well for the person unless they smarten up during the transition.</p>
