      <h1>Why Mason Mount has been dropped by Chelsea for Man City clash in the Premier League</h1>
      <h2>Frank Lampard has discussed his Chelsea team news for the game at Man City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T17:20:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard has opened up on his Chelsea team selections for the Premier League clash at Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Chelsea came into the game sat third in the table in the Premier League and one point and one place above Pep Guardiola's men.</p>
      <p>Lampard prepared for the clash by making some key decisions around his team as he made two changes.</p>
      <p>Cesar Azpilicueta returned to the side in place of Reece James, while Jorginho replaced Mason Mount as well in the midfield.</p>
      <p>Lampard admits that it was a tough decision to drop Mount to the bench and explained his reasons in an interview with Sky Sports ahead of the game.</p>
      <p>"It's nice problem to have. Mason has been so good for us. There will be areas of rotation," Lampard told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"It was a decision based on our opponents. If needed, he can come on and make that impression."</p>
      <p>On the back of the 6-0 defeat at City last season, Lampard is well aware of the tough task facing Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"I know about the game last season, I watched it. I trust the players, though, and it's up to the players to implement it (Chelsea's plan)," Lampard added.</p>
