      <p>Ross' reign did not get off to the best start as the capital club fell behind to a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/liam-polworth/"><b>Liam Polworth</b></a> strike in the ninth minute.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian/"><b>Christian</b></a> Doidge's fourth goal in two games restored parity on 21 minutes and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/florian-kamberi/"><b>Florian Kamberi</b></a> edged the hosts ahead four minutes later, before a fine solo effort by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daryl-horgan/"><b>Daryl Horgan</b></a> added gloss to the scoreline four minutes from time.</p>
      <p>The result marked a second win on the spin for the Hibees, who also hit the post through <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stevie-mallan/"><b>Stevie Mallan</b></a>, and sent them into the top six.</p>
      <p>There was a wholly inauspicious start to the afternoon for the home team, when the Steelmen grabbed an early lead. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jermaine-hylton/"><b>Jermaine Hylton</b></a> danced into the box before finding <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jake-carroll/"><b>Jake Carroll</b></a>, whose low shot struck the post and fell kindly for Polwarth to tap home the rebound.</p>
      <p>Hibs responded admirably and levelled through Doidge. Kamberi found <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-newell/"><b>Joe Newell</b></a> with a fine through-ball and, although the winger's shot was partially blocked by the out-rushing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mark-gillespie/"><b>Mark Gillespie</b></a>, the towering marksman managed to bundle the ball over the line.</p>
      <p>The hosts completed the swift turnaround midway through the first half as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/scott-allan/"><b>Scott Allan</b></a> made his mark.</p>
      <p>Allan produced a sensational through-ball to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jason-naismith/"><b>Jason Naismith</b></a> and the full-back's low cross deflected into the path of Kamberi, who showed admirable composure and fleet of foot to fire into the roof of the net in a crowded box.</p>
      <p>Gillespie was forced into action as Hibs sought to make the game safe after the break, making a sharp save to deny Doidge following some superb interplay between Kamberi and Allan.</p>
      <p>For all their inventive attacking play, the Hibees were fortunate not to concede a penalty on the hour mark when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-porteous/"><b>Ryan Porteous</b></a> appeared to haul Polwarth down in the box. The visitors howled for a spot-kick, but referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-beaton/"><b>John Beaton</b></a> remained unmoved.</p>
      <p>And Hibs added a third after 86 minutes with a classy counter-attack. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vykintas-slivka/"><b>Vykintas Slivka</b></a> found Mallan, who slipped a fine pass to fellow substitute Horgan. The Irishman did the rest, scampering forward and clinically firing beyond Gillespie.</p>
      <p>There was even time for Mallan – a star under Ross at St Mirren – to strike the base of the post, but the points were assured.</p>
