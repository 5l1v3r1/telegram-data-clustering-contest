      <p>Goals from Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy – his 12<sup>th</sup> of the season – deservedly kept Leicester in second place in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It took Leicester an hour to break down a determined Brighton side, but once they scored, a second seemed only a matter of time.</p>
      <p>When it came, it was reduced by VAR to a farcical level, as Vardy saw his penalty saved, the rebound put in by James Maddison, but a retake ordered – apparently for encroachment - which Vardy converted. Justice was done, and Vardy deserved a goal for his effort alone, but it was a messy and unsatisfying incident.</p>
      <p>Leicester had 57 per cent of the first-half possession but it felt like more. They were on the front foot from the kick-off and almost scored in the second minute as Brighton’s Solly March wrongly decided that Harvey Barnes’s cross from the left posed no problems and left it but Ayoze Perez saw his chance and nipped in to nod the ball against the angle of post and crossbar.</p>
      <p>After six minutes Vardy stole onto a free kick to the near post by Ben Chilwell and Maty Ryan produced a fine save to fingertip the former England striker’s header over the crossbar.</p>

      <p>As the pressure continued, Aaron Mooy was forced to hack the ball away from well inside the six-yard box when a corner-kick threatened to reach Perez. Brighton, without suspended captain Lewis Dunk and Ireland forward Aaron Connolly, struggled to get a touch, let alone put together a meaningful attack. Their backs were solidly against the wall until a brief breakaway forced a corner, Shane Duffy heading over unmarked from Mooy’s kick.</p>
      <p>But at the other end Leicester seemed almost to have too many options. Barnes had one low shot deflected just wide by Duffy and swivelled to strike another well over the crossbar. Almost Leicester’s best chance came in the final minute as James Maddison sent Vardy clear only for the former England striker to skew his shot well wide.</p>
      <p>Brighton tried to make the most of the fact that they were, somehow, still on terms and Ricardo Pereira had to cover quickly as Mooy ran onto a pass. Then Neal Maupay blasted a shot just past the angle. Suddenly March was attacking the Leicester right and Leandro Trossard was seeing plenty of the ball and a Brighton goal looked on.</p>
      <p>But Leicester are never more dangerous than on the break and they proved the point. On the hour Adam Webster’s error handed Vardy and Perez a chance on the break that they somehow manged to squander. However Brighton gift-wrapped an identical opportunity four minutes later and this time they made no mistake, Vardy setting up Perez to score from close range. It was almost 2-0 two minutes later as Vardy made a yard of space but Ryan blocked his shot.</p>
      <p>Leicester made it 2-0 ten minutes from time with the help – or was it hindrance – of VAR. Webster tripped Leicester substitute Demarrai Gray and although Ryan saved Vardy’s penalty, Maddison headed in the rebound for a 23<sup>rd</sup> birthday goal. But VAR denied him, indicating that there had been encroachment at the kick, and Vardy scored from the retake.</p>
