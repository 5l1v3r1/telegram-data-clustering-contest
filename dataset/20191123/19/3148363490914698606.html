      <h1>Oregon Business Owner Raises Money to Buy Homeless Man a Trailer</h1>
      <h2>A homeless man no longer has to worry about where he will sleep at night thanks to a business owner in Canby, Oregon.</h2>

      <p>For the past month and a half, 69-year-old Glenn Stevens has <a href="https://www.kgw.com/article/news/local/canby-trailer-stevens-doern-homeless/283-da7fcc77-f1ba-4e00-8790-ec1e1832374c">used</a> a metal bench outside a strip mall as his bed, according to KGW8.</p>
      <p>“It was convenient. It’s a safe environment right here,” he said of the bench and shopping area.</p>
      <p>Stevens told reporters that he recently lost everything but the clothes on his back. “I lost everything in my life. You’re looking at what’s left,” he commented.</p>
      <p>He said he spends his days volunteering at a local food bank to make the time pass and help others in need.</p>
      <p>“Look for things to do to make the day go by,” he told reporters.</p>
      <p>However, when local business owner Heather Doern saw Stevens lying on the bench one evening, she wanted to make sure he was okay.</p>
      <p>“I walked over and asked him if he was waiting for somebody, and he said he wasn’t,” she recalled. “I said, ‘Can I help with something?’ and he said, ‘I’m homeless. Am I bothering you by sitting here?’”</p>
      <p>What bothered Doern was the fact that her new friend had nowhere to call home, so she decided to do something about it.</p>
      <p>Once she posted the story to Facebook, her online community stepped up to the challenge and raised $2,000 to buy Stevens a trailer in hopes it would help him get back on his feet.</p>
      <p>“I just think it’s a human treating another human with kindness is my only description of it. I feel anybody would do it,” Doern said.</p>
      <p>At the Association of Oregon Counties conference in Eugene this week, officials <a href="https://www.klcc.org/post/housing-and-homelessness-weigh-oregons-counties">said</a>, “Affordability, availability, and lack of variety of housing types are three problems facing counties,” according to KLCC.</p>
      <p>Additionally, a recent study found that Oregon had the fourth <a href="https://katu.com/news/local/oregon-ranks-4th-in-homelessness-study-finds">highest</a> number of homeless people in the nation, KATU reported.</p>
      <p>However, Stevens no longer has to worry about where he will sleep at night, thanks to the kindness of his new friends.</p>
      <p>“I love you,” Stevens said to Doern Friday evening after she showed him around his new place. “That’s the best I can do on short notice.”</p>
