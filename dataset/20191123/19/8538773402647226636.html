      <h1>Man City earn win over Chelsea with De Bruyne, Mahrez goals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:16:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author">ESPN</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City fought back from a goal down to beat Chelsea 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/134947/Kevin-De-Bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a>, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/163940/Riyad-Mahrez">Riyad Mahrez</a> and Raheem Sterling scored for the champions, who leapfrogged Frank Lampard's side into third place in the league table.</p>
      <p>Chelsea were the best team in the opening stages of the match with <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/178487/Willian">Willian</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/236210/Fikayo-Tomori">Fikayo Tomori</a> missing good chances.</p>
      <p>The visitors took a deserved the lead just after 20 minutes through an <a href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/_/id/173556/ngolo-kante">N'Golo Kante</a> goal after a fine assist from <a href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/_/id/154595/mateo-kovacic">Mateo Kovacic</a>.</p>

      <p>De Bruyne equalised for City just eight minutes later with a deflected effort off <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/159319/Kurt-Zouma">Kurt Zouma</a>.</p>
      <p>Mahrez then put the hosts in the lead after 37 minutes after he skipped past <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/246844/Emerson">Emerson</a> and produced a curling strike into the far corner.</p>
      <p>On 43 minutes, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/44927/Sergio-Ag%C3%BCero">Sergio Aguero</a> pounced on a <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/169532/Kepa-Arrizabalaga">Kepa Arrizabalaga</a> mistake but hit the crossbar.</p>
      <p>City dominated possession throughout the second half but failed to get a third after a number of missed chances, with VAR ruling out a <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/156366/Raheem-Sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> goal in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>City boss Pep Guardiola will be concerned that <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/231828/Rodri">Rodri</a>, <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/43815/David-Silva">David Silva</a> and Aguero were all taken off due to injury.</p>
