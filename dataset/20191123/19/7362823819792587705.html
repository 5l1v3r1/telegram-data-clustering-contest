      <p>"I was crying the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it.”</p>
      <p>She added: "I was very pregnant, very puffy and bloated and I was like, ‘Oh god, of course the first time I go I’m gonna be huge!</p>

      <p>"Kanye [West] was performing so I wasn’t actually invited, I was just Kanye’s plus one. And that was okay with me because I never really dreamed I would be at the Met Ball.</p>

      <p>Kim says she actually wanted to wear a black version of the dress, but Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci — who was also dressing West — persuaded her against it.</p>
      <p>She said: "We chose a really stretchy fabric because I would be growing and we wanted to make sure that alterations were easy and it was comfortable.</p>

      <p>"I was like, ‘I think I should just do the black version,’ and Riccardo was like, ‘No, c’mon, we have to do the floral'.</p>
      <p>“Riccardo said afterwards, ‘What do you give a woman who is pregnant? You send her flowers.’</p>
      <p>“I could never really speak up at that point because I so shy and just wanted to make everybody happy!"</p>

      <p>However, she admits she did have two stars who approved of her outfit - Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen: “I just remember the Olsen twins came up to me and loved my outfit and my gloves, so none of the critics mattered because the Olsen twins approve!"</p>
