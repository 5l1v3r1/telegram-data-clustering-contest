        <b>Running any distance after eating a Big Mac seems ill advised. But imagine housing four Big Macs in between running four laps. What sounds like a drunken dare anyone would sober up to reject was recently taken on by former professional runner and two-time Olympian Nick Symmonds. Dubbed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDrN-ovGz24">Big Mac Mile </a>, the vile challenge, obviously created by someone keen on torture and inevitable failure, is a lot to watch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During his career, Symmonds used to run the well-known Beer Mile at the end of every season as a celebratory challenge. In 2012, he actually held the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyTTG2DFZok">U.S. Beer Mile World Record </a>, drinking four beers in between running four laps in total time of 5 minutes and 19 seconds.</p>
      <p>The lesser known Big Mac Mile takes on the same structure as the Beer Mile, challenging runners to run four lapsand stop to eat a Big Mac at the beginning of each lap. Oh, and competitors cant throw up.</p>

        <p>For the challenge, Symmond is joined by YouTubers and as competitors. The trio hit the drive thru, order a dozen Big Macs, and make their way to the track.</p>
        <p>This is a horrible, horrible idea, Symmonds says while laying out the Big Macs. But from there, its go time.</p>
        <p>After Lapray taps out early in the competition with some light cheating, Symmonds and Morgan battle it out to best each other. Progressively getting more sluggish with each lap, the pair eventually make it to the fourth burger. From there on out the goal is simple: Dont throw up.</p>
        <p>The last day we ever have McDonalds, boys, Lapray says as his competitors eat their final burgers.</p>

          <p>After a fierce chase post-burger four, Morgan comes out on top, inching out Symmonds by mere seconds. Morgan gets a time of 13 minutes and 37 seconds, clinching the World Record for the Big Mac Mile. Well, kind of. There's no actual World Record traceable for the Big Mac Mile. But that was still pretty fast.</p>
          <p>Morgan then predictably proceeds to vomit, as does Symmonds.</p>
          <p>This was a horrible idea for a video, Symmonds says at the end of the challenge, before throwing up into a bucket. At least he knows it.</p>
