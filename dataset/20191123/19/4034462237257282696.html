      <h1>Chevrolet Corvette Z06 Gets Luxury Makeover And 730 HP</h1>
      <h2>This custom Corvette Z06 has nearly as much power as a ZR1.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:05:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>Last week, we waved goodbye to the last-ever C7 <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-z06">Chevrolet Corvette Z06</a> to roll off the production line, which sold at a charity auction for a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/final-c7-corvette-sold-for-millions">staggering $2.7 million</a>. However, Caravaggio Corvettes, a Canadian tuner that specializes in custom Corvettes, has given the Z06 Corvette a new lease of life with its latest creation.</p>
      <p>The main highlight of this custom Corvette Z06 is its luxury interior. While the Corvette Z06 isn't renowned for its high-quality cabin, Caravaggio Corvettes have transformed it into a "luxurious hand-crafted work of art." Inside, the custom Linen leather seats give the sports car an unusually opulent look, while the back of the custom Sebring race seats are finished in Nero Marone to match the exterior and interior trim.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, the seat bezels are finished in matte silver, while the rest of the interior is finished in a combination of Brownstone and Linen leather with contrasting Brownstone and Linen stitching. The interior carpets are also finished in Marone Alcantara with Linen stitching throughout. Custom floor mats are fitted with a combination of Linen leather and Marone alcantara with Linen stitching and thumb grips are also added to the steering wheel to mimic the look of steering wheels inside European exotic sports cars.</p>
      <p>On the outside, the custom Corvette is repainted in Marone Metallica with exterior carbon in a gloss finish. All original carbon flash are painted in a custom Nero Marone color, while the headlights, A-pillars, rear quarter vents, and brake duct vents are painted to match the exterior color. Custom 20-inch wheels at the front and 21-inch wheels at the back completes the look, which features custom painted silver brake calipers with the Chevrolet logo.</p>

      <p>The upgrades aren't just cosmetic either, as Caravaggio Corvettes has also made some tweaks under the hood. Whereas the standard Corvette Z06 produces 650 hp and 650 lb-ft of torque, the tuner has extracted 730 horsepower and 730 lb-ft of torque from its 6.2-liter V8 engine, which makes it nearly as powerful as the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/corvette-zr1">Corvette ZR1</a>.</p>
      <p>This power bump was achieved by increasing the speed of the supercharger by 15 percent with underdrive pulleys, proprietary engine management, a cold air intake and a set of stainless-steel long tube headers.</p>
