      <p>A former CIA case officer has been sentenced by a US federal judge in Virginia to serve 19 years in prison after he pleaded guilty in May to conspiring to become a spy for China, federal prosecutors say.</p>
      <p>Jerry Chun Shing Lee, 55, left the CIA in 2007 and moved to Hong Kong. A few years later, in 2010, he was approached by two Chinese intelligence officers who offered to pay him $US100,000 and to take care of him "for life" for information he had acquired as a CIA officer.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of dollars were subsequently paid into Lee's personal bank account between 2010 and 2013 in exchange for his services.</p>
      <p>"Instead of embracing that responsibility and honouring his commitment to not disclose national defence information, Lee sold out his country, conspired to become a spy for a foreign government, and then repeatedly lied to investigators about his conduct," Zachary Terwilliger, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>According to the Justice Department, the FBI conducted a search of Lee's hotel room in Hawaii in August 2012 and discovered he had an address book and day planner containing handwritten notes he had made during his time as a CIA case officer prior to 2004.</p>
      <p>The notes included highly sensitive intelligence, such as the names of CIA assets, operational meeting locations, phone numbers and details on covert facilities.</p>
      <p>He later lied to the FBI when he was confronted.</p>
      <p>He pleaded guilty in May to conspiring to deliver national security defence information to aid a foreign government.</p>
