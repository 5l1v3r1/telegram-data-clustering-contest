      <p>Some provinces let you change your driver’s license online, but each location is different. Here’s a guide to changing your address online across Canada.</p>
      <p>When you move homes within a province or territory, you generally have a few weeks to change your address. Some provinces and territories still require you to go into specific physical locations, but a lot of them that are detailed below let you change it easily and quickly online.</p>
      <h3>Ontario</h3>
      <p>You can change your Ontario driver’s license by visiting <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/change-address-drivers-licence-vehicle-permit-and-health-card">Service Ontario’s website. </a>You have 30 days to change your address in Ontario.</p>
      <p>From there, you’ll need to provide a few details, including your old license details and your new address.</p>
      <p>Notably, in Ontario, you need to change the address for your health card at the same time.</p>
      <p>Change your <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/change-address-drivers-licence-vehicle-permit-and-health-card">Ontario address online here. </a></p>
      <h3>Quebec</h3>
      <p>In Quebec, when you change the address on your license, it also changes the address on your vehicle registration. You have 30 days to change your address after you move.</p>
      <p>You’ll need most of the information from your old licence, plus your new address.</p>
      <p>You can begin<a href="https://www.adresse.gouv.qc.ca/inscrire/FormulaireChangementAdresse.aspx?Etape=0&amp;Lng=en"> changing your address online here.  </a></p>
      <h3>British Columbia</h3>
      <p>West coast residents can change their address online and they need to do it within 10 days of moving.</p>
      <p>The B.C. version of the service is easy to use and it walks users through the process one step at a time.</p>
      <p>You can <a href="https://www.addresschange.gov.bc.ca/">change your address online here. </a></p>
      <h3>Saskatchewan</h3>
      <p>There are actually two ways to change your driver’s license online in Saskatchewan. You only have 15 days to change your address in Saskatchewan.</p>
      <p>The first is a service called Express Adress. This service also notifies other services that you’re changing your address, not just the Saskatchewan’s vehicle register. You can <a href="https://www.expressaddress.com/apex/f?p=132:9999:294885760274::::P9999_PAGE_ID:40818">check out the service here. </a></p>
      <p>The second service is the province’s driver’s licensing and vehicle registration program. You can <a href="https://www.sgi.sk.ca/mysgi">do that here.</a></p>
      <h3>Newfoundland and Labrador</h3>
      <p>You only have 10 days to change your address when you move in Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>
      <p>There isn’t an online portal to do this, but you can email ‘<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/23/provinces-change-drivers-license-online/addresschangemrd@gov.nl.ca">addresschangemrd@gov.nl.ca’</a> with your full name, driver’s Licence/Photo ID number and a document to prove your address change. You can find a list of valid documents that can be used to prove this on the <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/snl/drivers/driversandvehicles/driverlicensing/nameaddresschange/">province’s website. </a></p>
      <h3>Nova Scotia</h3>
      <p>Nova Scotia residents can also change their address online through an online form. You have 30 days to change your address in this province.</p>
      <p>This service is extremely straightforward, but in my test, I wasn’t able to open it with Safari. Chrome worked fine though.</p>
      <p>You can check out the <a href="https://isd.acol.ca/isd/rmv/ChangeAddress/Intro.do;jsessionid=2EF5575DC875026EB0CD13C9651DAA10">Nova Scotia site here. </a></p>
