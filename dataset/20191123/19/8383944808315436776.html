      <h1>Bolivia's Senate approves bill for new elections</h1>

      <p>Bolivia's Senate approved a bill Saturday that could open the door to new elections in the crisis-hit country, as the caretaker government prepared to meet with protesters to end weeks of unrest.<br/><br/>At least 32 people have been killed in violence that erupted after a disputed election on Oct. 20, with blockades causing severe fuel and food shortages in La Paz and other cities.<br/><br/>The Senate approved the proposed law after an hourslong session that began Saturday morning.<br/><br/>It now goes to the lower house for a second vote. Interim President Jeanine Anez will need to sign it before it can become law.<br/><br/>Among other things, the proposed bill annuls the results of the Oct. 20 vote and allows for new elections to be held.<br/><br/>Crucially, it also bars candidates who have served in both of the two previous terms from seeking re-election for the same position. That would prevent former President Evo Morales from contesting the presidency in the new ballot.<br/><br/>Congress also needs to agree on a new seven-member electoral court, after members of the previous panel were removed for allegedly manipulating results.<br/><br/>New elections are seen as crucial to ending Bolivia's worst political upheaval in 16 years, which has deepened divisions between indigenous people loyal to Morales and Bolivia's mainly city-dwelling middle and upper classes.<br/><br/>Morales, who had been seeking a fourth term, claimed he won last month's election, but opposition groups said the vote count was rigged.<br/><br/>An audit by the Washington-based Organization of American States found irregularities in the results.<br/><br/><b>'Pacify the country'</b><br/><br/>The Senate vote comes a day after the caretaker government filed a criminal complaint accusing Morales – Bolivia's first indigenous president who served for nearly 14 years – of "sedition and terrorism," after he allegedly called on supporters to maintain blockades.<br/><br/>If Morales – who fled to Mexico after resigning on Nov. 10 – were charged and convicted, he would face a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail.<br/><br/>His former top minister Juan Ramon Quintana, whose whereabouts are unknown, is also accused of the same crimes.<br/><br/>Morales, who claims to have been a victim of a coup after losing the support of the security forces, tweeted Friday – several hours before Interior Minister Arturo Murillo referred the case to federal prosecutors – that the investigation was based on "planted evidence and manipulated recordings."<br/><br/>Two children of Morales – Evaliz Morales Alvarado and Alvaro Morales Peredo – left Bolivia on Saturday for Argentina after being given the green light by the interim government, Murillo tweeted.<br/><br/>Morales tweeted Saturday that Evaliz had been accused of "illicit enrichment," which he said was a lie.<br/><br/>Right-wing senator Anez, who declared herself caretaker leader last week after Morales quit, on Friday called on anti-government protesters to "let us govern" and lift the road blocks.<br/><br/>In a potential breakthrough in the crisis, the government announced late Friday that it would meet with various opposition groups at the presidential palace on Saturday at 2000 GMT.<br/><br/>They hope to strike an agreement to "pacify the country," Public Works Minister Yerko Nunez told reporters.<br/><br/>It comes after police on Thursday tear-gassed indigenous protesters who marched on La Paz with the coffins of five of the eight people killed in clashes at a key fuel plant Tuesday.<br/><br/>The United States suggested Thursday that Morales should stay out of upcoming elections, which should be "free, fair and transparent."</p>
