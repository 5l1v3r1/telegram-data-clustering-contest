      <h1>DJ Toomp Talks About His Unreleased Collaboration With JAY-Z &amp; Rihanna</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/dj-toomp">DJ Toomp</a> has worked with some of the biggest artists in hip-hop, including <a href="https://genius.com/artists/ti">T.I.</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/wale">Wale</a>. But the Atlanta producer just revealed that he has a joint track with <a href="https://genius.com/artists/jay-z">JAY-Z</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/rihanna">Rihanna</a> in the vault.</p>
      <p>During an interview with <i><a href="https://www.revolt.tv/2019/11/21/20972115/kanye-west-jay-z-producer-dj-toomp-interview">Revolt TV</a></i>, the hitmaker was asked about his biggest unreleased track. “Rihanna and JAY-Z,” he responded. “I did a Rihanna and JAY-Z record that’s so fucking hard. This was made between 2009-2010."</p>
      <p>He elaborated on the sound of the stashed “hit.” “There are guitars that remind you of this <a href="https://genius.com/artists/beanie-sigel">Beanie Sigel</a> record, and Jay is rapping on the guitar part,” he said. “The beat breaks down with some guitars and then that’s when Rihanna comes on. They’re protecting that shit like a precious emerald.”</p>
      <p>Toomp previously worked with Jay on <a href="https://genius.com/Jay-z-say-hello-lyrics">“Say Hello.”</a> Meanwhile, Rihanna’s <a href="https://genius.com/Rihanna-numb-lyrics">“Numb”</a> sampled West’s <a href="https://genius.com/Kanye-west-cant-tell-me-nothing-lyrics">“Can’t Tell Me Nothing,”</a> which Toomp co-produced. JAY-Z and Rihanna also worked together on <a href="https://genius.com/Rihanna-umbrella-lyrics">“Umbrella,”</a> <a href="https://genius.com/Jay-z-run-this-town-lyrics">“Run This Town,”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Rihanna-talk-that-talk-lyrics">“Talk That Talk.”</a></p>
      <p>Although the DJ worked on the unreleased song, he doesn’t have access to it. “What’s so crazy is [Def Jam’s] Karen only wanted to play it for me one time,” Toomp said. “She was like, ‘I’m really not supposed to be playing this for you, Toomp.’ I was like, ‘Please, let me hear this damn record.’ She played it, and I was like, ‘Play it one more time’ and she played half of it. That was my first and last time hearing it.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, he was asked if he believes his frequent collaborator T.I. pioneered trap. “Come on, man. You already know I do,” he said. “I didn’t know what we were starting, but wasn’t really nobody talking about trapping on any records.”</p>
      <p>In a recent cover story for <i><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/rihanna-cover-november-2019">Vogue</a></i>, Rihanna <a href="https://genius.com/a/rihanna-shares-an-update-on-her-next-album-declines-to-give-up-a-release-date">described the sound</a> of her next album. “I like to look at it as a reggae-<i>inspired</i> or reggae-<i>infused</i> album,” she said. “It’s not gonna be typical of what you know as reggae. But you’re going to feel the elements in all of the tracks.”</p>
      <p>Back in August, JAY-Z and Roc Nation <a href="https://genius.com/a/jay-z-roc-nation-partner-with-the-nfl-to-co-produce-the-super-bowl-halftime-show">partnered with the NFL</a> to produce the Super Bowl halftime show.</p>
