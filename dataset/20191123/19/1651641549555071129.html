      <p>After launching the Nokia 6.2 and 7.2, it seems Nokia still wants to release new phones in 2019. The firm has announced a new phone launching this December.</p>

      <p>While HMD Global hasn’t given any hints about what this new phone could be, there are a few guesses. The Nokia 8.1 hasn’t seen a successor like the 7.1 line has, or the firm could be refreshing the Nokia 9. <a href="https://nokiapoweruser.com/tag/nokia-9-1-pureview/">NokiaPowerUser</a> has been reporting a Nokia 9 successors, dubbed the Nokia 9.1 Pureview. While it’s unlikely that Nokia would launch such a flagship without much fanfare, it isn’t like big launches helped sell the Nokia 8, 8 Sirroco or 9.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out more about this new handset come December 5.</p>
