      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing-line-up">Strictly Come Dancing</a> has always loved a bit of glitz and glam, and presenters Tess and Claudia are no exception.</p>
      <p>Tonight the presenting duo both stepped onto the ballroom in glitzy fashion ensembles, ahead of hosting week 10's live show.</p>
      <p>BBC dancing competition host <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tess-daly">Tess Daly</a> looked phenomenal as she sizzled onto the Strictly Ballroom in a shimmering champagne-coloured jumpsuit.</p>
      <p>Her co-host <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/claudia-winkleman">Claudia Winkleman</a> was also unmissable as she sparkled onto the 10's show of the series in a black one-shouldered gown with sequin embellishments.</p>

      <p>Blonde bombshell Tess, 50, looked sensational as she shimmered onto the dancefloor in the glittering bardot-style, one-shouldered jumpsuit which featured a flattering tie-in waist detail.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, brunette beauty Claudia, 47, changed up her look from her classic and plain outfits to a glitzy dress.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/claudia-winkleman">Claudia</a> sticked to her trademark all-black fashion but opted for a dazzling one-shouldered dress with statement shimmering fabric, a sleek design and a subtle asymmetrical hemline.</p>

      <p>The mum-of-three added glamour to her Strictly look with dark eyeshadow, thick mascara and added a slick of nude gloss to her lips.</p>
      <p>While Tess wore her glossy blonde locks in a straight style and accentuated her natural features with gold-tinted make-up and a glowing complexion.</p>
      <p>Both presenters added height to their fashion ensembles with stiletto heels.</p>
      <p>Despite presenting as a united front, both presenters have their own personal stylists to ensure their looks suit their individual personalities.</p>

      <p>Tonight's glittering show is a big one as competition heats up for the remaining six couples in week 10.</p>
      <p>The six surviving pairs have now danced past the competitionâ€™s halfway mark after impressing at the highly-anticipated Blackpool Tower Ballroom episode last week.</p>
      <p>At Blackpool, Michelle Visage and Giovanni Pernice followed in the footsteps of BBC's Mike Bushell and Katya Jones as they said goodbye to their chances of winning the Glitterball Trophy.</p>
      <p>Karim topped the leaderboard with his flawless Charleston while Michelle's performance of Madonna's hit song Vogue saw her become the latest star to be eliminated from the show.</p>
      <p>Kelvin matched Karim's score of 39 after their sensational Jive performance to Jailhouse Rock from Smokey Joe's Cafe.</p>
