      <p>A member of the Bloods in New York has been charged in the shooting death of Lil Kim's cousin.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> A New York gang member has been arrested in connection to the murder of rapper Lil' Kim's cousin.</p>
      <p>Daquan Carter stands accused of fatally shooting Courtney 'Aggy' Tingle in Brooklyn back in March.</p>
      <p>According to authorities, Tingle, 26, had been an affiliate of the street gang Team Bang Out, and became involved in a dispute, resulting in a shoot out.</p>
      <p>He was admitted to a local hospital with gunshot wounds to his torso, but doctors couldn't save him and Tingle was later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, detectives charged Carter with his murder and criminal possession of a weapon.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old is alleged to be a member of the Los Angeles-based Bloods gang.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn native Lil' Kim has yet to comment on the arrest, but she previously paid tribute to her cousin in the aftermath of his death.</p>
      <p>"It breaks my heart to have to send out this special RIP to my little cousin Aggy who was shot and killed...," the "Lighters Up" hitmaker posted on social media earlier this year.</p>
      <p>"You had so much potential. Your family will greatly miss you and we will always keep our lighters up for you."</p>
