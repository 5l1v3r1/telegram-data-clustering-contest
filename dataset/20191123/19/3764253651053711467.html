      <p>Asoquo Amba, the Ekiti state commissioner of police, has made a stunning revelation about the robbery incident which occurred at a new generation bank in Oye-Ekiti, Ekiti state, on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>Premium Times reports that the police boss said the robbery was either in connivance with workers at the bank or the workers also used the opportunity to steal from the bank’s vault.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> gathered that he made this known at a press conference on Friday, November 22, while making reference to a CCTV footage which he said showed bank staff taking money from the vault a few minutes before the attack.</p>

      <p>It was reported that the armed robbers stormed a branch of a new generation bank in Oye-Ekiti and left two persons dead.</p>
      <p>The robbers, in the daylight operation, carted away money from the bank’s vault and stole from the customers.</p>
      <p>The police commissioner said the CCTV captured bank workers moving in and out of the vaults, adding that the vault was open before the robbers arrived.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“What baffles me is that there was nexus between the robbers and insiders in the banking premises. The Oye police division is about one or two poles from here. It was the first point of attack. The bankers confirmed that they heard the shots and it took about 10 minutes before the robbers arrived at the bank from there.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“Between the time the robbers attacked our men and the time the robbery took place, the staff had enough time to escape through the exit door. They were captured by CCTV moving in and out of the vault. The vault was even opened before the robbers came,”</i> he said.</p>

      <p>Amba noted that there were some activities that went on inside the bank within the period, adding that it is either there was strict connivance, or that the bank officials took advantage to carry out their own intention.</p>
      <p><i>“Despite the opportunity, none of them made efforts to escape, they were stuffing money and there is evidence to prove this. The staff opened the vault by 3.05 p.m. and the robbers blew up the security door at 3.12 p.m., this gave a strong suspicion that there was internal collaboration in this matter,”</i> Amba said.</p>
      <p>He said the robbers carted away over N25 million from the bank, but N2 million contained in a carton was recovered.</p>
