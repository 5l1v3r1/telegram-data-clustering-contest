      <h1>Pope heads to Nagasaki, Hiroshima to preach anti-nuclear gospel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:20:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Pope Francis visits Nagasaki and Hiroshima on Sunday to preach the dangers of nuclear weapons against the backdrop of two cities uniquely associated with the devastation of the atomic bomb.</p>
      <p>The pope arrived in Japan late Saturday on the second leg of an Asia tour that began in Thailand, and his four-day visit is expected to focus heavily on the theme of peace and religious tolerance.</p>
      <p>Even before his arrival in Japan, the Argentine pontiff railed in a video message to the Japanese people against the "immoral" use of nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>"Together with you, I pray that the destructive power of nuclear weapons will never be unleashed again in human history," said the head of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics.</p>
      <p>He will begin his day in Nagasaki, where he is expected to evoke the horrific destruction and human toll of the twin bomb attacks in a call for a world free of nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>At least 74,000 people were killed in Hiroshima, and 140,000 people in Nagasaki when the United States dropped nuclear weapons on them at the end of World War II.</p>
      <p>Francis will deliver his remarks near the site of the attack in Nagasaki and later visit Hiroshima for an address at the world-famous peace memorial.</p>
      <p>- 'I never forgot the sight' -</p>
      <p>Among the audience will be some survivors of the attack, known in Japanese as hibakusha, as well as relatives of those killed in the devastating bombings.</p>

      <p>Minoru Moriuchi was just eight when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, and he still recalls the horror of finding his aunt and two cousins dead in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>"I never forgot this sight -- their bodies were reddish black and completely burnt," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Like many hibakusha, the 82-year-old fears that the lessons of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima attacks risk being lost when the last generation of survivors dies.</p>
      <p>"The Pope never meddles with politics, but I hope people listening to his message will think seriously about the nuclear issue," he said.</p>
      <p>Shigeru Tokuyasu, a former minister at the Japanese embassy to the Holy See, said the pope wields an almost unique ability to focus international attention on an issue like nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>"He has the ability to reach out to people across the world," he told AFP before the pope's arrival.</p>
      <p>"I don't think his visit will immediately help reduce nuclear arms, but it will be a step forward. It will help change the 'globalisation of indifference'."</p>
      <p>- 'Hidden Christians' -</p>
      <p>In Nagasaki the pope will also deliver a mass at the city's baseball stadium and offer a message of religious tolerance in a country where Christianity is very much a minority faith.</p>
      <p>Most Japanese practise a mixture of Shinto and Buddhism, two closely intertwined faiths based on the worship of nature and spirits, though Christian festivals like Christmas are also popular.</p>

      <p>There are only approximately 440,000 Catholics out of a population of 126 million, and Christians endured centuries of bloody repression in Japan after the faith was introduced by missionaries.</p>
      <p>In the 17th century, Japan was closed to the outside world and Christians were persecuted and killed if they failed to recant their faith.</p>
      <p>But a small community kept the religion alive, creating a unique version of Catholicism blended with Japanese culture and religious rites that was discovered when the country reopened to the outside world in the mid-19th century.</p>
      <p>Francis will pay tribute to these so-called "hidden Christians" -- or "kakure kirishitan" in Japanese -- at a memorial to some of the community's "martyrs" in Nagasaki.</p>
      <p>He returns to Tokyo on Sunday night where he will on Monday meet victims of Japan's "triple disaster" -- the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.</p>
      <p>He is also scheduled to deliver a mass at a Tokyo baseball stadium, meet Japan's new Emperor Naruhito and hold talks with Japanese government officials and local Catholic leaders.</p>
      <p>On the first stop of his tour in Thailand, he preached a message of religious tolerance, meeting the country's King Vajiralongkorn and the Buddhist Supreme Patriarch, who leads Thailand's Buddhists.</p>
