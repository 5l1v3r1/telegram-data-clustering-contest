      <p>Tropical Titans rowed their snakeboat to victory at Ashtamudi Lake in a photo-finish final at the 12th leg of the Champions Boat League (CBL) to score 173 points overall, emerging winners of the inaugural edition of the regatta.</p>
      <p>Raging Rowers came second, gaining a narrow edge over Mighty Oars that ended third in a close race that marked the finale of the championship modelled on IPL cricket. The victors had a lead of mere 11 milliseconds over their immediate rivals while the team that came third was just 13 milliseconds behind the runners-up.</p>
      <p>Tropical Titans emerged victors with a timing of 4:33.69 minutes along the one-km track, while Raging Rowers clocked 4:33.80 and Mighty Oars, 4:33.93. The final round of the CBL coincided with the annual President’s Trophy Boat Race (PTBR) that began in 2011.</p>
      <h3>Fastest Team prize</h3>
      <p>The ‘Nerolac Excel Fastest Team of the Day’ also went to Tropical Titans with the best timing of 4:21.50 in the heats. The team had earlier scored hat-tricks in the third round at Karuvatta (September 14), in the eighth leg at Kainakary (October 26), and the 11th leg at Kallada (November 16).</p>
      <p>The overall tally: Tropical Titans (173 points), Raging Rowers (86), Mighty Oars (76), Coast Dominators (75), Backwater Knights (60), Pride Chasers (50), Backwater Warriors (37), Thunder Oars (28), and Backwater Ninjas (26).</p>
      <p>Last weekend at Kallada, the penultimate round of the all-Saturday CBL, Mighty Oars had shared the third rank of the table with Coast Dominators with each team totalling 69 points. Today’s final witnessed a remarkably close race with Coast Dominators not figuring among the top three.</p>
