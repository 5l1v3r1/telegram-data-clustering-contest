      <p>Larry King has revealed that he suffered some health issues earlier this year.</p>
      <p>While talking to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/23/larry-king-reveals-he-had-an-unreported-slight-stroke-this-year/"><i>Page Six</i></a>, the TV host and interviewer said he had a “slight stroke” earlier this year. Reports at the time suggested King had a heart attack, a claim that his production company had denied.</p>

      <p>“I had what they call a slight stroke in March,” King, 86, revealed. “Everything is back to normal, except my left foot. I can’t walk on my left foot, so I’m walking with a walker. It’s making me feel old. But at least it helps me get around. Another thing I can’t stand is having people do things for me. I was always someone who did things for themselves.”</p>
      <p>King has turned to a physical therapist to help him walk on his own again.</p>

      <p>“They thought I was going to die in March,” he added. “They told my two boys to come home. It was really touch-and-go. I don’t remember any of it, because I was out during the whole time. I had a sepsis infection, I had a new stent put on the heart. It’s been amazing—everyone tells me they can’t believe I made it through.”</p>
      <p>But that isn’t going to slow down King who is back at work. “Being in [a] wheelchair doesn’t affect you, hosting a show,” he continued. “I’m proud to be able to do that.”</p>
