      <h2>Most Israelis believe Netanyahu cannot continue as PM, but 35% believe he can.</h2>

      <p>A <i>Channel 13 </i>poll showed that after Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/272061">announced that he would indict</a> Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, most Israelis believe Netanyahu cannot continue in his position.</p>
      <p>A full 56% of Israelis said Netanyahu cannot continue as prime minister, while 35% said he can, and the last 9% do not know.</p>
      <p>In addition, if elections were held today, the right-religious and center-left blocs would remain the same, with 55 and 57 seats each, respectively.</p>
      <p>The Blue and White party would win 36 Knesset seats, while the Likud party would win 33 seats.</p>
      <p>The Joint Arab List would retain its current 13 Knesset seats, and Yisrael Beytenu, led by MK Avigdor Liberman, would win eight seats.</p>
      <p>Ashkenazic-haredi UTJ would win six Knesset seats, as would the New Right and Sephardic-haredi Shas. Labor-Gesher, the Democratic Union, and the United Right parties would each win four Knesset seats.</p>
      <p>Respondents were also asked if their belief in law enforcement, the police, and the Prosecutor's Office had risen, dropped, or remained the same. While 20% said their faith in the law enforcement system had risen, 26% said it had dropped, 47% said it had not changed, and 7% said they did not know.</p>
      <p>The survey, conducted by Professor Camil Fuchs included 749 Israelis, 601 Jews and 148 non-Jews. Questioning of the Jews was handled by the Midgam institute, while that of non-Jews was handled by the StatNet institute. The survey has an error margin of 4.0% and previous votes and religious sectors were taken into consideration.</p>
