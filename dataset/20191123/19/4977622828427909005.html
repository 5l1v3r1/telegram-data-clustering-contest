      <h1>Urban Unemployment Fell To 9.3 Per Cent In January-March 2019; Youth Unemployment Also Went Down</h1>

      <p>The job scenario in the countryâ€™s cities seems to be improving, with the urban unemployment rate falling down to 9.3 per cent between January and March this year, <a href="https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/indias-urban-unemployment-rate-slows-in-march-2019-quarter-government-data-264001">reports </a><i>Wion News.</i></p>
      <p>This is the lowest it has been in the last four quarters for which data is available. Although the as of yet publicly unreleased report has not covered rural areas, it does show that youth unemployment had also fallen to 22.5 per cent in the same quarter, while it was 23.7 per cent in the quarter before that.</p>
      <p>Youth unemployment measures joblessness in people in the age group of 15-29, a cohort who are generally believed to be more vulnerable during an economic slowdown.</p>
      <p>Positive data about their employment numbers is welcome news in light of figures in recent months pointing towards slowing economic activity.</p>
