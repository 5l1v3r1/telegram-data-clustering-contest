      <p>On Saturday afternoon, Alabama took the field for a contest against an FCS foe. Western Carolina entered Tuascaloosa as a heavy underdog, though Las Vegas failed to set the line in Alabama’s favor enough.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide opened a 45-0 lead at halftime and didn’t look back.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, head coach Nick Saban made it clear Tau Tagovailoa’s little brother, Taulia, would play. Well, he kept his word and the freshman quarterback came into the game early in the second half.</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long for Taulia to find success.</p>
      <p>On his very first drive, Taulia threw his first career touchdown pass. It might have just been a quick swing pass, but it’s still and incredible moment for the young man.</p>
      <p>Check it out.</p>

      <p>Tua, who suffered a season-ending injury last weekend, watched from the sideline as his brother threw his first touchdown pass.</p>
      <p>Alabama is dominating the game – which is should. The Crimson Tide entered as a 52-point favorite and has already covered the spread in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>Can Taulia keep finding success? Stay tuned.</p>
