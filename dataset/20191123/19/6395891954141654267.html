      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford left the game against No. 2 Ohio State early in the second quarter after getting hit as he threw.</p>
      <p>Clifford went down awkwardly, with his right leg getting caught underneath his body. He still managed to complete a pass on the play but stayed down and came off the field walking gingerly but without assistance.</p>
      <p>Will Levis replaced Clifford and helped No. 9 Penn State complete a 75-yard touchdown drive, capped by Journey Brown's 18-yard run, to make it Ohio State 21-7 with 8:19 left in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>A fumble by Ohio State on its next offensive play set up Penn State in the red zone, and Levis ran for a 1-yard score to make it 21-14 moments later.</p>
