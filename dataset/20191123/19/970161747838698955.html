      <p>When it comes to buying Christmas gifts for new <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mums/">mums</a>, choosing the perfect present can be hard. You want to buy for the new baby, but you also want to buy for the mother too – without filling her drawers with new sleepsuits and dummies (even though they always come in handy).</p>
      <p>So just to make your life that little bit easier, we’ve put together a Christmas gift guide for new mums, to make their festive day just as special as their new baby’s.</p>
      <p>Take a look below at all of these lovely new mother themed gift ideas.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is one of those gifts that no mum thinks to buy but every mum wants. It’s to make an impression of the baby’s hand or footprint in a soft clay, which can be preserved forever in the wooden frame next to a photo of the baby.</p>

        <figcaption>Pate, wine and cheese has been out of the question for a while… (Picture: Hay Hampers)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Now this is a great idea. For obvious reasons: Because it involves wine, something a new mum hasn’t drunk for over nine months.</p>
      <p>It also includes soft cheese and pate – two things that are also on the banned list when it comes to pregnancy foods.</p>
      <p>Any mum will be happy to get stuck into these things she’s been missing out on for so long (unless she absolutely hates all three, of course).</p>
