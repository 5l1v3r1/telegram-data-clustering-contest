      <p>Masturbation is a natural and safe way to explore your body, feel pleasure, and release built-up sexual tension. It occurs among people of all backgrounds, genders, and races. There are different myths and beliefs about this act, however, most cannot be scientifically and medically proven.</p>
      <p>Below are some side effects of masturbation:</p>
      <p><b>Addiction</b><br/>According to Healthline, Some people can and do develop an addiction to masturbation. You may be spending too much time masturbating if masturbation causes you to: skip your chores or daily activities, miss work or school, cancel plans with friends or family, miss important social events</p>
      <p>Addiction to masturbation can harm your relationships and other parts of your life. Masturbating too much may interrupt your work or studies, which can lower productivity.</p>
      <p>It may also hurt your romantic relationships and friendships, because you don’t spend as much time with your loved ones as you used to, or don’t pay attention to their needs.</p>
      <p>If you’re worried you may have an addiction to masturbation, speak with your doctor or a counsellor about ways to cut down on masturbating.</p>
      <p>Talk therapy can help you manage your addiction. You could also cut down by replacing masturbation with other activities. Next time you have an urge to masturbate, try: going for a run, writing in a journal, spending time with friends, going for a walk.</p>
      <p><b>Guilt leading to depression</b><br/>Basically because of religious and moral beliefs, masturbating can lead to guilt, knowing it is an act not supported by cultural, religious or moral beliefs. Constant guilt without having no one to discuss with can lead to depression. Most often, it is not easy to overcome depression.</p>
      <p>It is better to talk to a friend or therapist about this urges and guilt, this will prevent depression or self-harm.</p>
