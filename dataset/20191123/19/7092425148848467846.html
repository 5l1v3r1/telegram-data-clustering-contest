        <b>Munster 21-21 Racing 92</b>
      </p>
      <p>Munster and Racing 92 played out a stunning draw at Thomond Park in the Champions Cup this evening.</p>
      <p>A try from Andrew Conway late on gave Munster the chance to equalise but JJ Hanrahan still had to notch a conversion from the touchline.</p>
      <p>It could have been even better as Hanrahan attempted a drop goal right at the death but it flew wide of the left post.</p>
      <p>Finn Russell's try gave Racing the advantage before Teddy Thomas touched down after half an hour.</p>
      <p>Munster struck back through Keith Earls just before half-time but Hanrahan missed the conversion leaving the score at 14-11 in favour of the visitors at the break.</p>
      <p>A Hanrahan penalty in the 48th minute made it 14-14 before disaster struck for Munster when Juan Imhoff scored his side's third try.</p>
      <p>Munster were 21-14 down going into the final quarter but they launched a brilliant comeback, culminating in Hanrahan's brilliant conversion.</p>
