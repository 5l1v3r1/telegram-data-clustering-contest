      <p>Leading on-demand delivery app Lalamove teamed up with Globe Telecom to provide jobs to at least 1,000 members of Gawad Kalinga communities.</p>
      <p>Under the partnership, qualified Gawad Kalinga members will follow a special scheme allowing them to easily join and earn more in Lalamove. Through hard work, diskarte and dedication, motorcycle partner drivers can earn up to P30,000 a month.</p>
      <p>The first leg of training and onboarding sessions was conducted in North Caloocan and Valenzuela, with around a hundred partner drivers joining the delivery platform. To date, Lalamove has more than 45,000 partner drivers nationwide.</p>
      <p>“This is only the beginning. We really look forward to what this partnership can bring,” said Lalamove managing director Dannah Majarocon. “Lalamove is on a mission to empower communities through delivery, and Globe and Gawad Kalinga are the perfect partners to help us achieve that,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We are excited to partner with Lalamove and Gawad Kalinga on this project.  We hope that through our partnership hinged on connectivity and mobile services, we can help Lalamove achieve better operational efficiency and relationship with their drivers, employees, and customers.  At the same time, Gawad Kalinga is a top-of-mind partner given our different initiatives with them. Together with Lalamove and Gawad Kalinga, we all share the same goal of contributing to nation building through livelihood opportunities and digital transformation,” said Bernie Llamzon, Globe head of channel management group.</p>
