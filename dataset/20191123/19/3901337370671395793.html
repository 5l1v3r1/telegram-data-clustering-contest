        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Crystal Palace 1-2 Liverpool</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 23 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Selhurst Park</p>
      <p>Premier League leaders Liverpool maintained their unbeaten run this season following a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain got rewarded with a spot alongside Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane up front in place of Mohamed Salah, who started on the bench.</p>
      <p>Liverpool received the first scare when a Gary Cahill header deflected off the bar after looping over Alisson Becker following a free-kick from Luka Milivojevic.</p>
      <p>The Eagles pulled to the far side of the area in the final ten minutes of the first half, but Firmino poked Virgil Van Dijkâ€™s flick behind for a corner kick.</p>
      <p>Palace seemed to have gone ahead three minutes to halftime when James Tomkins nodded home from the far post, but the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) ruled out the strike following a foul in the build-up.</p>
      <p>With no changes from either during halftime, the visitors were off to a threatening start with Mane in particular flashing attempts at the goal of Vicente Guiata.</p>
      <p>Mane went and broke the deadlock four minutes later when he turned in the area to volley in off the left hand post despite the best efforts of Guaita.</p>
      <p>Christian Benteke looked to haunt his former club in the final 12 minutes, but his acrobatic bicycle kick in the area flashed across the far post.</p>
      <p>Palace were back on level term on 83 minutes when Wilfred Zaha collected a square ball from the left to slot beyond Alisson after hesitant defending from Dejan Lovren.</p>
      <p>However, Liverpool regained control five minutes later when sloppy clearances off a corner invited Firmino to fire home from a close range to seal three points.</p>
