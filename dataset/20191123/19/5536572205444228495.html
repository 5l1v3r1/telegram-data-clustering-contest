      <h1>Dwight Howard Claims Accuser Has Stopped Responding To Assault Case, Wants Judge To Rule On Countersuit</h1>

      <p>Dwight Howard is now asking a judge in his assault case to rule in his favor after Masin Elije seemingly stopped responding to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://bossip.com/1812783/dwight-howard-says-assault-accuser-stopped-responding-to-case-asks-judge-to-rule-on-10-mill-countersuit-exclusive/">Bossip</a>, Howard filed documents this week against Elije because he “never countered Howard’s contention that Elije didn’t have proof of any interaction between them.”</p>
      <p>It was Elije who first kicked this off by claiming he was in a relationship with the Lakers star as well as the explosive cliam that Howard “was in everyone raw” at “transgender sex parties,” and that he had an “understanding” with a “transgender prostitute.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Howard’s lawyer filed court docs contending Elije had no evidence whatsoever that he’d threatened him, offered him money to sign a nondisclosure agreement or proof that Howard sexually harassed him.<br/><br/>Howard’s lawyer pointed out that he asked Elije to produce the evidence in the case as they moved towards trial. But Elije never did, the lawyer said, and now Howard has asked the judge to rule on his countersuit, based on the lack of evidence, and throw Elije’s case out.<br/><br/>A judge has yet to rule on the case.”</blockquote>
      <p>Dwight Howard wants this settled as quickly as possible, seeing as how he is having a resurgence in his career with the Lakers.</p>
