      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to tackle the ‘tax and wage cheat culture’ of multinational companies who ‘rip off’ workers.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn set out his plans to stop companies offshoring their tax bills to ‘lower tax regimes’ with measures to force them to pay their fair share in the UK.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside an Amazon depot in Sheffield, the Labour leader set out his ‘fair tax programme’ to clamp down on tax dodging.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn hopes the measures will raise £6.3 billion for the exchequer in 2024 to help pay for its manifesto plans to nationalise key utilities in a ‘green industrial revolution’.</p>
      <p>Along with shadow employment rights secretary Laura Pidcock, the Labour Party leader said the party would increasing HMRC targeted audits and set up an inquiry into the finance sector.</p>
      <p>Among the measures would be a 20% offshore company property levy, greater scrutiny of MPs’ tax affairs and a pledge to scrap non-dom status which gives tax advantages.</p>

      <p>Labour also vowed to end in-work poverty, with plans to give a £10-an-hour minimum wage for all, ban zero-hours contracts and give every worker full rights from their first day in a job.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn said: ‘We’re here to say to big companies that operate in Britain that in future you’re going to have to pay taxes on all your operations in this country – you will not be able to offshore your tax bill to some lower tax regime.</p>
      <p>‘I think these are just basic issues of social justice and that’s why I’m here this morning.’</p>
      <p>He said that zero-hours contracts would be a ‘thing of the past’ under Labour, and everyone in work would know ‘exactly what their basic income is going to be’.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn has previously written a birthday card to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, wishing the company ‘many happy tax returns’ and demanding it pays more UK tax and improves working conditions.</p>
      <p>However, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which claims to speak for 190,000 businesses,  warned the plan could lead more companies to question whether they had a future in Britain under a Labour government.</p>
      <p>CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said the ‘vast majority’ of businesses already followed ‘responsible’ tax practices.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Businesses in the UK have faced too much political uncertainty. Jeremy Corbyn’s announcement today leaves companies asking, “should I stay or should I go?”</p>

      <p>‘Labour need to recognise that the best way to push up wages and tackle inequality is by improving productivity.’</p>
      <p>An Amazon spokesman said: ‘These claims about Amazon are false. The Government wrote the tax laws and they are designed to encourage investment, and we are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK – more than £18 billion since 2010.</p>
      <p>‘This investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of £793 million during 2018 – £220 million in direct taxes and £573 million in indirect taxes.</p>
      <p>‘This year, we announced plans to create 2,000 new jobs in the UK, taking our total workforce to over 29,500.</p>
      <p>‘Our associates receive industry-leading pay, with all employees earning at least £9.50 to £10.50 an hour depending on location.’</p>
