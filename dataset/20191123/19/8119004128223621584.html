        <b>The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal headed by ASM Abdur Rab has become the latest party to suffer a split-up.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A faction led by General Secretary Abdul Malek Ratan, whom Rab had at his side all the time whenever the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal had split up earlier, has rejected a council convened by Rab.</p>
      <p>The party would hold the council on Jan 11 next year, not on Dec 28 as called by Rab, Ratan said at a press conference in Dhaka on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We are the original JSD. They joined hands with the anti-liberation forces,” Ratan said.</p>
      <p>He also pointed finger at Rab for the split. “A faction of the party leadership is responsible for the situation. Since I am the general secretary of the party, there is another faction of the party leadership. You know who he is."</p>

      <p>Last week, the Liberal Democratic Party led by Oli Ahmad suffered a split when a splinter of the BNP’s ally formed a new committee, leaving the retired colonel out.</p>
      <p>The JSD joined the BNP’s Jatiya Oikya Front alliance led by Dr Kamal Hossain before the last general election.</p>
      <p>Leaders of the Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed Bangladesh’s independence and saw its top leaders hanged for war crimes, also contested in the election under the coalition after losing registration as a political party.</p>
      <p>Ratan lost the election as an Oikya Front candidate for a seat in Cumilla.</p>
      <p>In a written statement at the press conference, JSD Joint General Secretary Ataul Karim Faruk blamed Rab for nepotism and leaning much towards the Oikya Front.</p>
      <p>“The majority of the leaders and activists have not accepted the illegal council based on a person’s wish undemocratically in violation of the party’s constitution,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rab, who had been elected vice-president of the Dhaka University Central Students’ Union or DUCSU before the Liberation War, became involved in forming the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal after independence.</p>
      <p>The party has suffered a number of splits since then.</p>
      <p>In 1996, Rab became the president and Hasanul Haq Inu the general secretary when two active factions of the party merged. Rab was also made a minister in the Sheikh Hasina-led government at the time.</p>
      <p>Later, Rab and Inu split the party again.</p>
      <p>After the Election Commission allotted the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal’s torch symbol to the faction called JaSoD and led by Inu, Rab got his faction registered as JSD before the polls.</p>
