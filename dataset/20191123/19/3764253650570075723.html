        <b>- Kola Ologbondiyan, the party's spokesman, in a statement on Saturday, November 23, accused INEC of colluding with APC to rig the elections in the two states</b>
      </p>
      <p>After its review of the governorship elections held in Bayelsa and Kogi states on Saturday, November 16, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government and the All Progressives Congress (APC) did not want democracy to thrive in the country.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> reports that a statement issued by by the PDP national publicity secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Saturday, November 23, indicated that the party said it rejected the results bandied by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the elections.</p>
      <p>He said the party also rejected the proposed Kogi West senatorial rerun election, which according to him, has already been desecrated by the manipulations in the main election.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The statement read: <i>"As long as the figures in the main election are fundamentally flawed, the proposed rerun cannot reflect the wishes of the electorate and Nigerians are wondering if it will make any sense to participate in an electoral process that is already deficient.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Nigerians across board have completely lost faith in the nation’s electoral process given that Independent National Electoral Commission under Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has been annexed and cannot conduct any free, fair and credible election. For us in the PDP and, we believe, to majority of Nigerians as well, Professor Yakubu is the worst electoral umpire in the political history of our nation."</i>
      </p>
      <p>The party alleged that the police and the military high commands have been reduced to tools of election brutality to ensure that votes do not count.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"More distressing is the fact that Nigerians, particularly our members and supporters in Kogi and Bayelsa states, are still in trauma over the murderous November 16 elections. A lot of our people have been killed and our members are still grieving.</i>

      <p><i>"It is public knowledge that all accredited local and international observers, including the civil society situation room, have declared that the elections did not meet the minimum standard for credible election and have unanimously called for outright cancellation,"</i> the statement added.</p>
      <p>It also stressed that there was nothing to indicate that more people would not be massacred in the proposed Kogi West senatorial re-run election.</p>
      <p><i>"There are reports in the public space that the APC-controlled federal government does not want Senator Dino Malaye in the Senate just because of his forthrightness in defending the interest of the people,"</i> the statement added.</p>
