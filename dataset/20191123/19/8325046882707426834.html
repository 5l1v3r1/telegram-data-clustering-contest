        <li>Riyad Mahrez’s stunning solo goal completed a fine Manchester City comeback against Chelsea on Saturday.</li>
        <li>The Algerian dribbled between two Chelsea defenders, before taking a moment to look up and subsequently passing the ball nonchalantly into the back of the net in the 37th minute.</li>
        <li>City had gone behind in the 21st minute courtesy of an N’Golo Kante goal, however, was level just eight minutes later through Kevin De Bruyne.</li>
        <li>Mahrez’s winner means City leapfrogged Chelsea in the Premier League table into third place, and kept alive its hopes of catching league leaders Liverpool, whom it trails by nine points.</li>

      <p>Riyad Mahrez’s stunning solo goal saw Manchester City end Chelsea’s run of six consecutive wins in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s fine recent form has seen it climb the to third in the English top division, and a win at The Etihad Stadium would have seen it secure that position for at least another fortnight, moving four points ahead of chasers City.</p>
      <p>Things got off to a perfect start for Frank Lampard’s men, whose dominance in the opening proceedings was rewarded with an N’Golo Kante goal – the Frenchman holding off makeshift centre back Fernandinho to slot home in the 21st minute.</p>
      <p>However, that lead lasted less than lasted all of eight minutes, with Kevin De Bryune leveling the score courtesy of a fortunate deflection of the foot of Kurt Zouma.</p>
      <p>Though there was a slice of good luck in City’s equalizer, its second in the 37th minute, which proved to be the winner, was all of Mahrez’s doing.</p>
      <p>The Algerian picked the ball up on the right flank around 40-yards from goal, before driving at Chelsea duo Mateo Kovacic and Emerson.</p>
      <p>While the pair appeared to have Mahrez covered, some superb footwork saw him jink between them both, after which he looked up and nonchalantly passed the ball into the far left corner of his goal.</p>

      <p>Raheem Sterling had made it 3-1 in the final moments, only to see his goal ruled out for offside by VAR.</p>
      <p>Mahrez’s goal was his fourth of the season, and ensured City moved up to third in table, also ensuring it kept alive its hopes of catching league leaders Liverpool, whom it trails by nine points.</p>
