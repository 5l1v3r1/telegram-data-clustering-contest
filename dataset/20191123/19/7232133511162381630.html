      <h1>Bitcoin Primed for a Move to $8,000, but Bear Trend Isn’t Over Yet</h1>

      <p>After facing a sharp drop into the upper-$6,000 region yesterday morning, Bitcoin’s bulls have stepped up and propelled the crypto higher, laying the foundations for the cryptocurrency’s recent lows to be a mid-term bottom for BTC.</p>
      <p>Analysts now widely expect Bitcoin to see further gains in the short-term, but it is important to note that the cryptocurrency is still firmly caught in a mid-term bear trend, which means that it may ultimately see further downside in spite of its near-term bullishness.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Climbs from Recent Lows as Bulls Fight Back </h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/wheres-ultimate-bottom-for-bitcoin-plunge-5100-analyst/">Bitcoin</a> is trading up over 2% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $7,320, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of roughly $6,700 that were set during BTC’s latest sell-off.</p>
      <p>This level has long been viewed as a strong level of support for the cryptocurrency, and its bullish price action in the time since it visited this level confirms that this is in fact a strong level of support, and may signal that further bullishness is imminent in the near-term.</p>
      <p>Further supporting this notion is the fact that Bitcoin has broken above the upper boundary of a clearly defined pennant that it formed in the time following its recent drop, which may signal that further upwards momentum is imminent.</p>
      <p>Big Cheds, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet while pointing to the chart seen in the below tweet.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC #bitcoin early action favors bulls,” he concisely noted.</blockquote>

      <h3>Economist: BTC May Climb to $8,000, But Bear Market Remains Strong </h3>
      <p>As for where this upwards momentum may lead <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-price-breaks-below-8000-as-bears-erase-historic-rally/">BTC’s price</a> in the near-term, Alex Krüger, a popular economist on Twitter who focuses primarily on cryptocurrencies, explained that he believes BTC will visit $8,000 shortly, but that further downwards momentum is imminent.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC views – this is a bear market, price action says so – price set a local bottom today – $8000 will trade again soon =&gt; short above – good spots for longs: $6400/$6000 – high odds halving won’t be bullish – many miners will capitulate if hash growth continues unabated,” he explained.</blockquote>

      <p>Assuming that the upcoming mining rewards halving is not a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/20/bitcoin-visits-critical-long-term-trendline-break-below-could-lead-to-massive-losses/">near-term price action</a> as Krüger believes, BTC may see significant further losses in the coming weeks and months.</p>
