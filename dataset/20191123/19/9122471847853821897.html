      <h1>Chase Young Heisman Trophy Hype Increasing vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:59:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>A defensive player winning the Heisman Trophy? It’s a rare occurrence in college football. Michigan’s Charles Woodson is the last to do so, and that was over 20 years ago in 1997.</p>
      <p>But due to Chase Young’s stupendous performance against Penn State today, there’s legitimate discussion regarding Young’s chance of winning the Heisman Trophy. The Ohio State defensive end is proving he’s not just the best player at his position, but the best player in college football, regardless of position.</p>
      <p>Folks are starting to voice their support for Young to win the Heisman Trophy. Should he be the clear front-runner after his performance against the Nittany Lions?</p>

      <p>LSU QB Joe Burrow has long been the Heisman front-runner and he’s certainly proved he’s worthy of winning the award. The Tigers are undefeated, and Burrow has put up some video-game like stats.</p>
      <p>But Young is a human cheat-code. Simply put – he’s all over the field. Young’s ability to get in the backfield in particular and wreak havoc is on another level. Heisman voters are certainly starting to take notice.</p>
      <p>As the College Football Playoff scenarios start to heat up, almost everyone is hoping the Buckeyes and Tigers meet in either the semi-final or national championship.</p>
      <p>You can catch the rest of the Buckeyes’ contest against Penn State on FOX.</p>
