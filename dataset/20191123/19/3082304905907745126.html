        <b>There are no shortage of options for Conor McGregor, who is set to make a UFC return in 2020</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conor McGregor has been challenged to put his “money where his mouth is” by Jorge Masvidal, who is keen to mix it with the big-talking Irishman.</p>
      <p>Former two-weight UFC champion McGregor is reported to be making a comeback to the Octagon in January and his manager last month said he hopes to conclude a deal for a bout with Donald Cerrone.</p>
      <p>However, an ESPN tweet posted on Friday displayed a graphic showing potential opponents for McGregor and Masvidal in 2020, which prompted a reply from the former saying: “I’ll go at anyone on that list”.</p>
      <p>Masvidal could not pass up the opportunity to have a say of his own, writing to McGregor: “Put your money where your mouth is I’m the only 1.”</p>

      <p>The 35-year-old Masvidal has seen his stock rise during a fine 2019 that started with a second-round knockout of Darren Till prior to a stunning five-second triumph over Ben Askren.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Masvidal earned a controversial stoppage over Nate Diaz.</p>
      <p>McGregor last fought in UFC 13 months ago, in a now infamous lightweight defeat to Khabib Nurmagomedov.</p>
