      <p>A day after four policemen were killed in a Naxal attack in Jharkhand, the Election Commission (EC) on Saturday appointed a retired IPS officer as a special police observer for the Assembly election in the State.</p>
      <p>Mrinal Kanti Das, an IPS officer of the 1977 batch, retired as Manipur’s Director-General of Police.</p>
      <p>He was deputed as the special observer for Tripura and Mizoram during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.</p>
      <p>“The Election Commission took the decision in light of the specific challenges of Left-Wing Extremism affecting the law and order situation in Jharkhand.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. Das will reach Ranchi today [Saturday] to take up his responsibility and oversee the deployment [of forces] and [deal with] other security issues,” the Election Commission said in a statement.</p>
