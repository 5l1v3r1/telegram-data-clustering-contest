        <i>• Pool 3: Harlequins 15-9 Bath <br/>• Hosts claim first win in this season’s Champions Cup</i>
      </p>
      <p>After the couple of weeks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/harlequinsru">Harlequins</a> have just endured, any old win would do for them. And any old win is what they got. At least they can come away from this claiming a lingering interest in the competition but it is a tenuous hope, if they harbour it at all. The English contingent in this pool remain in the bottom half. Ulster and Clermont Auvergne will not be unduly worried.</p>
      <p>Bath’s injury crisis may yet deepen, with Anthony Watson suffering a head-knock late on, in an incident for which Elia Elia received a harsh yellow card, and captain Charlie Ewels hobbling off early in the second half.</p>
      <p>Quins clinched the game with a penalty from nearly 50 metres by James Lang. It hung high in the drizzle, before creeping over, a rare moment of suspense in a miserable match for the neutral – and surely for many of the partisan. By then Marcus Smith had opened up a 12-0 lead, but a try would have been a luxury too far on such a night.</p>
      <p>Both sides <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/european-champions-cup-roundup-rugby-union">were already as out of the running</a> as out can be after just one game in the Champions Cup and, with Saracens breathing down their necks at the bottom of the Premiership table, well might they be focused on matters elsewhere.</p>
      <p>The rain did not help. On the back of a dominant scrum Quins set about building an early lead and, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/09/harlequins-worcester-premiership-match-report">unlike against Worcester</a> here a fortnight ago, defending it successfully. Not that that was hard. Bath could make nothing work. Their star backline might as well have been watching in the stands.</p>
      <p>Quins were not much more exciting. There was one nice piece of interplay around about the 20-minute mark between Smith and Matt Symons, but it merely highlighted the dearth on offer otherwise. Smith had landed three penalties by then for a 9-0 lead that Quins maintained to the break.</p>
      <p>As the drizzle sat heavy in the air, so did the crowd in their seats. Quins, stung no doubt by their humiliation in the Auvergne the previous weekend, not to mention that home defeat by Worcester the week before, certainly played with more intensity and were well worth that half-time lead, but the first half will not linger in the memory. Not many have here of late.</p>
      <p>Another “moment” from Smith at the start of the second pricked hopes but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/bath">Bath</a> held out. Quins settled for a fourth penalty and a 12-0 lead, the very same as they surrendered to Worcester.</p>
      <p>Sure enough, Bath replaced four of their front five – the fifth, the captain Ewels, hobbled off a few minutes afterwards – and their game noticeably improved. Which is to say, they boshed a little more effectively. Their first penalty of the match followed, and then their second. Freddie Burns kicked both to pull them back to within a score as the game entered its final quarter.</p>
      <p>No chance of a cliffhanger. Lang stepped up after another nothing penalty in a nothing area of the field.</p>
      <p>That late yellow card for Elia set up Bath for a late attacking rumble – and Burns’s third penalty clinched them a bonus point. With home and away matches against Clermont to come, they are all but out. Quins’ prospects are not much healthier.</p>
