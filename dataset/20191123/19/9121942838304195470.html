      <p>MILWAUKEE (AP) — Giannis Antetokounmpo had 28 points and 10 rebounds for his 16th consecutive double-double to help Milwaukee beat the Detroit Pistons 104-90 on Saturday night, the Bucks’ seventh straight victory.</p>
      <p>Wesley Mathews added 13 points and Eric Bledsoe 11 for the Bucks, who improved their record to an Eastern Conference best 13-3.</p>
      <p>Derrick Rose had 20 points, Langston Galloway had 13, and Andre Drummond had 12 points and 17 rebounds for Detroit, which played without Blake Griffin.</p>
      <p>Griffin, who has played in just four games, was inactive for injury recovery after playing 32 minutes in the Pistons 128-103 victory over Atlanta on Friday in the first game of the back-to-back.</p>
      <p>Antetokounmpo is the first player to open the season with 16 consecutive double-doubles since Moses Malone did it with the Houston Rockets in 1981. Antetokounmpo and George Hill hit consecutive 3-pointers to fuel a 12-0 run to open the fourth quarter and put Milwaukee in front 89-69. Detroit missed its first eight shots of the quarter before Langston Galloway finally hit a 3-pointer with 5:47 remaining.</p>
      <p>The Bucks used a 15-2 run midway through the third quarter to open a 71-54 lead. Detroit whittled the lead to 77-69 entering the final period.</p>
      <p>Hill’s 3-pointer at the buzzer put the Bucks up 54-47 at the half. Milwaukee shot 51 percent in the first half, making 21 of 41 shots, but Detroit stayed close thanks to nine second-chance points.</p>
      <p>TIP-INS</p>
      <p>Detroit has four players who were with the Bucks last season — Tim Frazier, Thon Maker, Tony Snell, and Christian Wood. “As I went through their depth chart, I was like, ‘Wow,’ don’t remember having four from a previous team, previous season and then playing them,” Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said.</p>
