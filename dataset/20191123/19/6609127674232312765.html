      <p>He also showed off his moves with wife and model Penny Lancaster, 48, who joined him on the floor.</p>
      <p>She later took to Instagram and posted an image of her hubby in bed with his favourite <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic</a> top on.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “The Celtic loving boy having a lay in after an incredible night, raising 1 million for @teenage_cancer.</p>
      <p>“Now he’s off to Manchester for his first show of the UK tour ending just before Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Sir Rod is set to perform three sell out shows at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow this week (on November 26, 28 and 30).</p>
      <p>We told how Celtic-daft <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4987590/celtic-rangers-rod-stewart-brother-dad/">Sir Rod revealed his oldest brother is a Rangers fan</a> – and that his dad has a Light Blues player named on his grave.</p>
      <p>The rocker told how sibling Robert is a dedicated Gers supporter – but he says the pair “don’t have fights about it”.</p>
      <p>He also said that ex-Ibrox and Scotland defender Eric Caldow is engraved on his father’s grave.</p>
