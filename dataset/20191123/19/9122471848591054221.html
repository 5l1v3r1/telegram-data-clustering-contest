      <h1>Ohio State Is Melting Down In The 2nd Half vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:41:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>A few minutes into the third quarter, and it looked like Ohio State was going to run away from Penn State in today’s game, which will likely decide the Big Ten East. The Buckeyes led 21-0 after Justin Fields found K.J. Hill for a 24-yard touchdown.</p>
      <p>Throw in an <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/penn-state-nittany-lions/injury-update-for-penn-state-qb-sean-clifford">injury to Penn State starting quarterback Sean Clifford</a>, and it looked like neutral fans might be able to start looking for other games to check out. The Nittany Lions signal caller took a big shot and suffered what appeared to be a lower body injury.</p>
      <p>Basically everything that has happened since has been horrible for the No. 2 Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>Will Levis came in and helped engineer the first Penn State touchdown drive, capped by a pair of long Journey Brown runs, including an 18-yard touchdown scamper.</p>
      <p>On Ohio State’s first play of the ensuing drive, J.K. Dobbins fumbled it away deep in Penn State territory. Levis found Pat Freiermuth on a pass to the 1-yard line, and called his own number to score.</p>

      <p>Three plays into Ohio State’s next drive, Justin Fields lost a fumble. It looked like Levis might drive down the field again, but Chase Young and Jashon Cornell picked up a big sack to force  Penn State field goal to cut things to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=401112256">21-17</a>.</p>
      <p>Young just picked up another sack deep in Penn State territory, so he’s making his mark on the game. Ohio State needs to get something going on offense again, with 17 straight points for Penn State.</p>
