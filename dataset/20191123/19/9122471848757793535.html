      <h1>Video: Ohio State Marching Band Trolls Michigan During Halftime Show</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:01:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Ohio State marching band is making the most of its final home game of the season. While the Buckeyes are currently engaged in a contest against No. 8 Penn State, the marching band took it upon itself to troll another team – the Michigan Wolverines.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Michigan will face off next week in Ann Arbor. Rivalry tensions are already high as the Buckeyes have so much to play for including national championship aspirations. The Wolverines would love nothing more than to spoil those championship hopes.</p>
      <p>During the halftime show of the OSU-PSU contest, the Buckeyes’ marching band put together one of its best performances yet. The band arranged itself into scissors, and proceeded to “cut” a University of Michigan flag.</p>
      <p>One OSU fan caught a video of the marching band’s epic trolling. Check it out below.</p>

      <p>That’s one way to get rivalry week started a bit early. The OSU marching band certainly lives up to its reputation as the ‘Best Damn Band in the Land.’</p>
      <p>As for the Buckeyes’ current contest against Penn State, they hold a 21-0 third quarter lead. Ohio State’s defense is stuffing Penn State on the ground and through the air.</p>
      <p>Justin Fields and J.K. Dobbins are presenting major problems for the Nittany Lions’ defense. If Penn State has any chance of mounting a comeback, the defense will have to stop the Buckeyes’ rushing attack.</p>
