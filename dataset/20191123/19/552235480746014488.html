      <h1>Celtic fan beats the bookies as he wins thousands of pounds with free bet</h1>
      <h2>The Hoops diehard couldn't believe it when he checked his coupon at full time to see he had won an incredible sum of money.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:50:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:50</time> by <a rel="author">Mark McDougall, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-mcdougall/</a></address>
      <p>A Celtic fan cleaned out the bookies by claiming an incredible £4000 from a free bet.</p>
      <p>Kieran Caw picked nine teams to win during the Saturday 3pm kick-offs and astonishingly all of them were winners.</p>
      <p>It was a double celebration after watching his own team batter <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-park">Celtic Park.</a></p>
      <p>Late goals were needed to seal the huge win with Rotherham even coming back from two goals down to win 3-2 in the final 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>The incredible bet was made with McBookie and the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> season ticket holder admitted he didn't even realise the offer was in his account.</p>
      <p>And now Kieran admits his daughter will have an even better Christmas than normal after his incredible win.</p>

      <p>Kieran said: "I noticed I had a £20 free bet with McBookie this morning that I had no idea about.</p>
      <p>"Decided to fire it on nine teams just to see what happened. I looked at half time and saw Rotherham were 2-0 down so thought it was done and didn't bother checking it again.</p>
      <p>"In the end it was three or four late goals to win it and it was absolute madness.</p>
      <p>"That will be Christmas sorted for my daughter Layla now and I'll pick up a couple of things for myself as well."</p>
      <p>Kieran picked Fleetwood, Rotherham, Peterborough, Oxford, Forest Green Rovers, Swindon, Crewe, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeds-united-fc">Leeds</a> and West Brom as winners in his coupon.</p>
      <p>Peterborough scored a 91st minute winner, Leeds needed an own goal in the 90th minute and West Brom scored with an 88th minute penalty to secure the incredible win.</p>
      <p>McBookie were quick to respond to Kieran's initial tweet about the win, saying: "With two 90min winners with one of them being an OG. Send me the lottery numbers please."</p>
