      <p>Alex Fisher missed out of Exeter City’s trip to Crawley Town with a groin injury, boss Matt Taylor revealed after the match.</p>
      <p>The ex-Yeovil Town man had grabbed the winner in midweek against Cambridge United, his second goal in three games, but eyebrows were raised when he was not part of the 18 for Saturday’s clash.</p>
      <p>Taylor though said that Fisher has picked up a groin strain and the club chose not to risk his fitness.</p>
      <p>Dean Moxey’s 77th minute winner was enough for the Grecians to pick up a 1-0 win and see them rise to 4th in the table.</p>

      <p>Taylor said: “Whenever you score as a centre forward you want to keep playing, but he picked up what we think and hope is just a groin strain. He had a real tight groin on Thursday and couldn’t train and we felt with it being November and with so many games to come we didn’t want to risk him.</p>
      <p>“He might have got through the game, but I honestly can’t tell you. We just felt in terms of how hard he had worked, it would have been too big of a risk to play him Luckily it has worked out okay as we didn’t need him in the end and I thought Ryan Bowman led the line well.”</p>
