      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has defended his ‘neutral stance’ towards a second <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> referendum, calling it a sign of ‘strength and maturity’.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader shrugged off Tory criticism accusing him of ‘deciding to be indecisive’ on the issue at the heart of next month’s general election.</p>
      <p>During a stop on the campaign trail, Mr Corbyn told voters in Sheffield he was offering them a ‘sensible way forward’ which could unite communities.</p>
      <p>‘I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘My role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that is carried out in a fair way, that the offers put are fair, and that I will carry out the result of that referendum.</p>
      <p>‘I think this is actually a sensible way forward that actually can bring people together.’</p>

      <p>However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Labour leader’s stance ‘won’t wash’ with the electorate.</p>

      <p>He told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Saturday programme: ‘I think it is an absolute disaster.</p>
      <p>‘You can’t ask this country to be its prime minister while not having a view on the biggest issue of the day.’</p>
