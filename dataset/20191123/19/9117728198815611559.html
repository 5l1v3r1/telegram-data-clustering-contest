        <b>As BMW-Andretti driver Maximilian Guenther was given a time penalty after the Diriyah e-Prix, former <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> driver Stoffel Vandoorne was bumped up to the podium places at the first race weekend of the Formula E season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Guenther was found guilty of overtaking under yellow flag conditions, getting past Lucas di Grassi while the Safety Car was still out. The 22-year-old finished ahead of di Grassi in second place but was given a total of 24 seconds' worth of penalties, not only denying him his first-ever FE podium but dropping him outside of the points altogether.</p>

      <p>As for Alex Sims, Guenther's teammate, he dominated the e-Prix from start to finish, getting pole position and taking the flag at the end of the afternoon in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Vandoorne, who has paired up with F2 champion Nyck de Vries at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a>' new works team, therefore got his second podium of the weekend as he has looked incredibly impressive so far.</p>
