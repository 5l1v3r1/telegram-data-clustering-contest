      <p>The joint opposition has called an all-party conference on Nov 26 to chalk out a future strategy against the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).</p>
      <p>According to media reports, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Fazlur Rehman telephoned Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) senior leader Ahsan Iqbal to discuss the political situation in the country, especially after the Azadi March and the departure of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.</p>
      <p>The two leaders agreed to set up contacts with the opposition parties to strengthen the anti-government Rehbar Committee and chalk up ‘Plan C’.</p>
      <p>Maulana Fazlur Rehman had led a two-week protest against the government in Islamabad which began in Karachi on Oct 27 but was later called off. It was followed by a ‘Plan B’ that included blocking key roads and highways across the country but that too was called off by the opposition’s Rehbar Committee on Tuesday.</p>
