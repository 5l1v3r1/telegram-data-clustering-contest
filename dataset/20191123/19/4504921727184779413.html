      <p>President Hage Geingob has directed the acting Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Albert Kawana to immediately undertake an assessment of the existing processes and procedures relating to the management of the sector.<br/>Speaking during SWAPO's star rally in Windhoek on Saturday, Geingob said the assessment must be followed by recommendations to prevent and eliminate instances of maladministration, nepotism and corruption in the fisheries sector.<br/>His directive comes as former ministers Bernhardt Esau and Sacky Shanghala were implicated in an international fishing scandal involving Iceland's fishing company, Samherjii.<br/>The two were among Namibians who reportedly pocketed kickbacks amounting to N$150 million.<br/>President Geingob told party members and supporters that he fully understands the frustrations of the citizens as corruption destroys the very fabric of the Namibian society.<br/>Therefore, he further directed Kawana to review the affairs of Fishcor over the last 10 years with a view to make recommendations and in cases where he may discover maladministration take corrective measures.<br/>Geingob, SWAPO's presidential candidate, asked the voters to allow the directive to be carried out unhindered.</p>
