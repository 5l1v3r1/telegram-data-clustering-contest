      <h1>Three People Injured During Shooting Outside Shoreline Mafia Show: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:12:29+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/cvernoncoleman/" target="_blank">C. Vernon Coleman II</a></address>
      <p>Three people were injured in a shooting outside of a <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/shoreline-mafia/">Shoreline Mafia</a> show in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on Friday night (Nov. 22) outside a venue called The Complex where the group performed, reports <i><a href="https://apnews.com/cccd1187e6ef42cab8010e2ed5e94a79">The Associated Press</a></i>. According to Salt Lake City police Lt. Carlos Valencia, shots were fired from a vehicle around 10 p.m. as three people exited the venue. Two of the victims were friends. One was shot in the chest. The other was shot in the arm. The third victim, a juvenile, was hit by a ricochet in the foot. All three victims have non life-threatening injuries and are cooperating with the police investigation.</p>
      <p>According to investigators, the two adult victims got into an altercation inside the venue. It is not clear if that was the catalyst for the shooting. Shoreline Mafia's team has released a statement to <i>XXL</i>, confirming the shooting incident took place and the group was not involved.</p>
      <p>Shoreline Mafia members Fenix and Ohgeesy are currently on the last leg of their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3m1Jo_AUZ5/">Paid in Full Tour</a>, which was not accompanied by other group members Rob Vicious and Master Kato. However, Fenix and Ohgeesy recently <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/10/shoreline-mafia-debut-album/">told <i>XXL</i> its all love</a> and the group will soon return to full strength.</p>
      <p>"It's four people," Fenix confirmed of the members in the group. "We figuring it out."</p>
      <p>"Yeah, it's all like everyone is starting to do they own individual shit," Ohgeesy added. "Like Rob actually had his own solo shit, even before. So he dropped his shit, that's what "Bands," "Bands" just went platinum. So, we all just like, it's a group, but we all gon' work on our individual shit as well."</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/01/shoreline-mafia-interview-the-break/">L.A.-based group</a> plans to drop an album in 2020.</p>

      <p>“We did this show in Atlanta on Ty [Dolla $ign]’s tour. We was all on the tour bus and it was a bunch of people I didn’t meet. Ty’s tour bus was like the fuckin’ Source Awards. But everybody was on there—Trouble, Migos, everybody. I’m going to introduce myself to everybody and everybody would be like, ‘Come on, dog, we know who you are. When we workin’? What we doin’?’ That was crazy, but I brought Jermaine [Dupri] out. I brought Hoodrich Pablo Juan out and he did a song; I brought [Lil] Scrappy out and he did 'Head Bussa.' And then I closed my set with Jermaine and he did 'Welcome to Atlanta' in Atlanta and the whole crowd went crazy. Like, no one really brings JD out to do that, so I’m thinking that’s Jay-Z level. That’s crazy. Do we have footage? I need that.”</p>

      <p>"I had a room, right? So I go in my hotel room and it was a girl that worked there. I don't know if she got drunk and got bold to do it, but when I go back in the room, she came out the drawer. She hid in my room until I got back and came out of the drawer. I think we were in Houston. I put her out—you gotta roll."</p>

      <p>“We were on the road with Dizzy Wright. I think it was like, Albuquerque, N.M. Or it might have been El Paso—one of those fuckin’ places. There were a bunch of fans arguing and screaming in the parking lot. Our security—his name is DJ—came and got me and was like, ‘Yo, you gotta check this out.’</p>
      <p>My first reaction is to jump in between them and try to make sure that everything’s cool, you know? Didn’t realize these kids were heavily gang-affiliated. You ever seen that movie, <i>Only the Strong</i>, where they sing, ‘Ba, na, na, weh,’ and they’re kinda stabbing at each other with knives and shit? It was some shit like that and I was in between them. They were trying to poke each other so I was like, ‘Y’all wanna keep having hip-hop shows? Y’all gotta stop this shit right now,’ so the crowd kinda dispersed. I foolishly thought it dispersed because I made an impact and I was like, 'Yeah, I fuckin’ killed this shit, brought the peace in.' Two seconds later, you hear tires screeching—one of the kids who was involved in the tussle, his peoples had pulled up. Crowd scatters. I’m not a street dude, like, fuck that shit. So I was like fuck it, I booked it to the merch, behind the merch truck. I was duckin’ and then the fighting still kept on going.</p>
      <p>Have you ever seen a hockey fight where they pull the shirt over? So these kids, one of them pulled the shirt over, he finally cut the other kid and he was just laying, bleeding in the parking lot. It was crazy. The police were on their own schedule. It was a good five, six minutes that passed. At a Dizzy Wright show, too. We’re like, peaceful; everybody’s chillin’.”</p>

      <p>"I was fuckin' performing and I just see something fly on the stage. This huge-ass item fly on the stage. Boom! I stopped the show. 'Yo, what the fuck? Who the fuck threw this shit on the stage?' I see a group of dudes ganged up in the corner. I'm like, 'Yo listen, I'ma fuck yall niggas up!' I continue the show, go home. I go in my Instagram messages, Some girl hits me up. She goes 'Did you get the cookie, filled with gelato, that I threw on the stage?' I'm like, 'Why would you throw some shit on the stage? You threw a cookie of all things. You had niggas in the crowd like, 'Ohhh,' why you do that shit?' I followed her right after though. We're friends now. I just hit her up the other day like, 'Yo, you good?'"</p>

A muhfucka just be [like], 'This my gal, you can have her tonight Ke!' I be like, 'Nah'. I'm scared of that move really—that's too strong right there. I don't want that one. As far as like an autograph, women take they bra off, took they titty out: 'I want it on here!' I be like damn! Boy, I've had some women go far. They'll say any goddamn thing."</p>

      <p>“A whole show getting shut down because I guess it was getting too crazy. They pepper sprayed everyone in the crowd. It was an all-ages show. I had to sneak everyone out the back; it was getting too wild and people were climbing on the stage. It was crazy. It was in [Greater] Sudbury, Canada.”</p>

      <p>"When I was in Sweden, I stayed an extra day to two days. We were like, 'Fuck it, I'ma just see how many fans I have out here.' I was like, 'Yo, meet me here.' About 80 kids pulled up to my hotel. They're waiting to just take a picture with me and then dip. Some stayed, brought me weed, smoked it with me."</p>
