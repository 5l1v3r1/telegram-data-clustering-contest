      <h2>Eleven participants to be inducted as volunteers to protect Tamil Nadu from cyber attacks</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:29:35+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>A team from SSN college emerged as the winners of the first ‘TN Police Hackathon’ conducted jointly by the police and the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) on Saturday.</p>
      <p>A total of 11 participants were given badges and they will become volunteers to protect the State from cyberattacks.</p>
      <p>Unlike other days, when the Director-General of Police office is seen teeming with men clad in khaki, the campus was flooded with youngsters clad in a white t-shirt with the event’s name, ‘Tamil Nadu Police Hackathon’, emblazoned on it.</p>
      <p>Unmindful of the rain, over 200 participants, including first year college students, working professionals and ethical hackers, in 111 teams took part in the event which began in the morning.</p>
      <p>Armed with their laptops, the youngsters sat in the conference hall to take the test.</p>
      <h3>Cyber Arangam</h3>
      <p>“It was a Capture The Flag event. The task was to attack and defend a server. The team from SSN college won the first prize. Two teams got the second prize and three teams got the third prize. A total of 11 participants will be inducted as volunteers to the Cyber Arangam,” said a senior police officer.</p>
      <p>Following this, they will be called whenever their services are needed.</p>
      <p>The participants were also happy. “It is a great opportunity for us. If selected I will be more than happy to do something for the State. As most of the crucial installations are automated, it will will be easy to cripple a country by launching cyberattacks. It is high time the police used the service of ethical hackers,” said a participant.</p>
      <p>A senior police officer said the police in partnership with IIT Madras has designed Cyber Arangam to function on the public-private partnership model. The objective is to develop a cyber resilient eco-system to fight the growing cyber attacks by synergising academia, research groups, ethical hackers, IT industry, law enforcers and individuals.</p>
