      <p>The second half of the Harvard-Yale game is currently being delayed. A massive student protest has broken out on the field at the Yale Bowl.</p>
      <p>What appears to be hundreds of students are sitting at midfield, protesting climate change.</p>
      <p>“This is an emergency,” one sign reads.</p>
      <p>The game is under delay and based on the size of this protest, it’s unclear if it will resume anytime soon.</p>

      <p>“At halftime of Harvard-Yale a sit in protesting climate issues has broken out on the field, at least delaying the second half and the way the protest is growing I would be shocked if the game continues,” Joel Sherman <a href="https://twitter.com/Joelsherman1/status/1198318294396215296">tweeted from the game</a>.</p>
      <p>The students are reportedly protesting their respective schools’ willingness to invest in oil and gas companies that contribute to climate crisis. The signs accuse the schools of being “complicit” in it.</p>
      <p>Harvard is leading Yale, 15-3, at halftime.</p>
