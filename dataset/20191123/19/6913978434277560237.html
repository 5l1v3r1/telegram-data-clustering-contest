      <p>RIYADH — Ahmad Al Khateeb, chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage (SCTH), recently said that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is excited to be opening its doors to the world, and added that the immediate impact has been over 50,000 visitors since the September launch of the tourist visas.<br/><br/>Al-Khateeb had said, “We recognize the value of tourism not only as a driver of economic growth but as an important cultural bridge that increases awareness, understanding and respect.” <br/><br/>He embellished this fact in a recent interview with Bloomberg that the growing number of applicant for the tourist visas, the aim of diversification of the economy would be realized while boosting the cultural bond.<br/><br/>“British tourists, followed by Chinese, were the top visitors,” Al-Khateeb told Bloomberg in Riyadh and added, “About 140,000 people requested tourist visas.”<br/><br/>The numbers are “in line with our expectations,” Al-Khateeb said. “We are expecting that the adventurous will come first to explore the country, and this is what is happening.”<br/><br/>He spoke to Bloomberg on the sidelines of an event to launch a $17 billion project called Diriyah Gate.<br/><br/>The Kingdom “will continue our reforms,” Al-Khateeb said. “When we promote our tourism, we’re promoting the history, the heritage, the culture and I believe we have enough offerings to our guests.”<br/><br/>Businesses could be allowed to stay open during daily prayers, Al-Khateeb said, if it becomes “a must.” For now, people are managing their time and the prayer closures are “not a problem,” he said.<br/><br/>“I think this is not an obstacle to people to come and shop in a shopping mall or outside,” he said. “But definitely, we are assessing the tourist’s journey and we are receiving very valuable feedback from our tourists and our visitors.” —SG</p>
