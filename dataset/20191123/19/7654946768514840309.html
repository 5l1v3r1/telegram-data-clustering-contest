      <h1>Tom Brady’s Patriots pout session shows how spoiled he is</h1>

      <p>Fan or hater, if you’re a follower of the Patriots (and particularly Tom Brady), you viewed the behavior of New England’s star quarterback after a 17-10 road win over the Eagles last Sunday as either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Curious.</li>
        <li>Arrogant.</li>
        <li>Prescient.</li>
        <li>Funny.</li>
        <li>All of the above.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To review: In his postgame press conference, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/tom-brady-cant-hide-his-anger-with-the-patriots-offense/">Brady was uncharacteristically terse</a> with his answers to reporters’ questions, appeared decidedly down, and he abruptly ended the session after just 1 minute, 45 seconds.</p>
      <p>This, it should be noted, came after a win.</p>
      <p>Not only a win, but a road win against the team that vanquished the Patriots in the Super Bowl two seasons ago. A win that gave the Patriots a 9-1 record, which happens to be tied for the best record in the NFL and has them in the driver’s seat for AFC home-field advantage in the playoffs.</p>
      <p>So, what was the deal with that 105-second pout session?</p>
      <p>Brady came off, to a degree, like a spoiled superstar after he didn’t perform up to his lofty standards.</p>

      <p>To the many have-nots in the NFL, he came off sounding like someone who’d just won the lottery but didn’t like the denominations of the bills he received as payment — “More hundreds, please.”</p>
      <p>Can you imagine being a Jets fan, who hasn’t seen a playoff team in nearly a decade, listening to Brady nit-pick about a spotty offensive performance in a ninth win in 10 games this season?</p>
      <p>Brady threw for just 216 yards, had 21 incompletions and the only New England touchdown pass was thrown by receiver Julian Edelman.</p>
      <p>Clearly, Brady’s motivation was to articulate cause for alarm, perhaps to motivate his fellow offensive players to step up their game, beginning with Sunday’s intriguing matchup at home against the Cowboys.</p>
      <p>“I was very happy we won [I] just wish we would have played better offensively,’’ said Brady the next day on his weekly radio spot on WEEI. “It’s just frustration with the offense. I am happy we won on the road, but at the same time just wish we would have scored more points.’’</p>
      <p>Just four teams in the NFL have scored more points this season than the Patriots’ 287. But the Patriots are ranked a pedestrian (for them) 16th in total offensive yards, 24th in rushing and seventh in passing.</p>
      <p>“The strength of our team is our defense and our special teams,’’ Brady said. “On offense, we just have to take advantage when we get opportunities and understand where our strengths lie and try and play to them —not giving any short fields, not turning the ball over and try and take advantage when we get into the red area to score touchdowns. That is kind of where our offense is. That is kind of where our team is.”</p>
      <p>Brady, of course, is wrapped up in his own world. What he doesn’t realize is that there are about 30 other teams around the league that would trade places with where he and his team is.</p>
