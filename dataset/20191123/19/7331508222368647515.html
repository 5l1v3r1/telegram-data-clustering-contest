      <p>The second half of Saturday's <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/108/harvard-crimson">Harvard</a>-<a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/43/yale-bulldogs">Yale</a> game has been delayed after a number of spectators rushed the field to stage a climate-change protest.</p>
      <p>After the game went to halftime around 1:40 p.m. ET with the Crimson leading 15-3, students from both schools occupied midfield after the Yale band had finished performing.</p>
      <p>Some held banners asking their colleges to act on climate change and Puerto Rican debt relief, including one sign that read, "Nobody wins. Yale &amp; Harvard are complicit in climate injustice."</p>
      <p>"Hey hey, ho ho, fossil fuels have got to go," some protesters chanted.</p>
      <p>Players were stretching and warming up when spectators first came on to the field. The players returned to the locker room as hundreds more people streamed onto the field.</p>
      <p>Police officers were seen escorting some protesters away.</p>
      <p>Saturday was the 136th edition of The Game between Harvard and Yale. The Bulldogs would clinch an Ivy League title with a win.</p>
