      <p>The Postal Intelligence unit of the Customs Department has busted a major racket involving the smuggling of cannabis through parcels from foreign countries.</p>

The samples were sent for testing to the narcotics lab, which certified them as cannabis (ganja), a prohibited substance under the NDPS Act 1985. “During the last three months, Customs has seized 31 consignments of ganja of various quantities, totally weighing 4 kg, from foreign postal parcels arriving from those countries. On investigation, it was found that in most cases, the consignee names provided to book the parcels were fake and in some cases consignees stated that their names were misused to book parcels,” said sources in Customs. One Parama Guru K. 28, of Chennai who had placed order for 112 grams of cannabis for personal consumption through the dark web from Canada to his friend’s address and had paid ₹45,000 in Bitcoin, was arrested.</p>
