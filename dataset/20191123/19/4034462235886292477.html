      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/fast-furious-is-about-to-get-even-less-realistic">Fast &amp; Furious franchise</a> has featured some of the wildest and most memorable custom cars on the big screen, from the Ice Charger in 'Fate of the Furious' to the orange <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/toyota/supra">Toyota Supra</a> driven by Paul Walker in the original 2001 movie 'The Fast and the Furious.' Back in 2011, a modified green and black 1971 <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/pony-car-icons-part-2-plymouth-barracuda">Plymouth Barracuda</a> nicknamed the "Frankencuda" made an appearance in 'Fast Five', and now the movie car is looking for a new owner.</p>
      <p>Built for the 2010 <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/horror-shows-from-sema">SEMA show</a>, the Frankencuda stands out thanks to its massive 636 cubic-inch (10.4 liters) Hemi V8 with an intercooled 14:71 blower and Ultra Dominator carburetors that force all air through an intercooler.</p>

      <p>Despite its menacing performance, the Frankencuda runs on pump gas, which means it's technically street legal. A two-tone finish in PPG Snakeskin Green with a cartoon impressionist mural of Frankenstein covering the top adds to the car's striking appearance.</p>
      <p>Inside, the interior features leather seats complete with snakeskin inserts and three DVD screens on a custom fabricated dashboard. Other modifications include a 400 three-speed transmission, coil over suspension on all corners, and four-wheel power disc brakes.</p>

      <p>While the Frankencuda only made a brief appearance in the film, it clearly made a strong impression on set because the dashboard has been autographed by several cast members including Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, and director Justin Lin.</p>
      <p>As well as the 2010 SEMA show, the Frankencuda has featured in Mopar Collector's Guide and Hot Rod Magazine. The movie car will be sold at an upcoming auction in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia via Worldwide Auctioneers. There's no price estimate, but Frankencuda fetched $308,000 when it was sold in the US back in 2011. For a die-hard Fast &amp; Furious fan, this is a unique opportunity to own one of the cars built for the film series.</p>
