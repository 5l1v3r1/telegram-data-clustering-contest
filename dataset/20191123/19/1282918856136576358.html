      <h3>WWE star Seth Rollins is now a Manchester City fan</h3>
      <p>WWE superstar Seth Rollins was on a show with the <i>BBC</i> where the guest and the journalist predict scores of a Premier League matchweek. Rollins, who was a West Ham fan because he did well with them on EA Sports FIFA, said he’s now a Manchester City fan for the same reason. Seth Rollins said that it is a bit difficult for him to follow Manchester City during the Premier League season.</p>
      <p>When quizzed about FIFA, Seth Rollins said that he thinks he is a good player but quite not the case. He said that he prefers playing FIFA on Switch, while struggles playing the game on a PlayStation or an Xbox. Rollins further said that fellow WWE stars Cesaro, Sheamus and Rusev are also hooked to FIFA but they prefer playing it on PlayStation. He said that he doesn’t go around playing with them because PS is foreign to him and he doesn’t want to lose.</p>
