        <b>- The APC's candidate, Adeyemi, is leading Melaye with over 20,000 votes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ahead of Saturday, November 30, supplementary election in Kogi West senatorial district area of Kogi state, the candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), Smart Adeyemi, has said that nothing would stop his rival and candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/1589-dino-melaye.html">Dino Melaye</a>, from defeat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/vanguard.html">Vanguard</a> reports that he made the statement on Friday, November 22, in Lokoja, the state capital, while urging his party members not to over relax but give their all to win the election.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> gathered that Adeyemi is already leading Melaye with over 20,O00 votes in the election conducted on Saturday, November 16, for the senatorial axis.</p>
      <p>The former senator said that despite having a comfortable lead, the party must not give in to overconfidence, but rather doubles its efforts to get the remaining votes.</p>

      <p>He said: <i>“We as party members must mobilize and fight like never before for the remaining votes. We must commence House to House move, and telephone contacts of the 30,000 PVC holders.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We must not look at the supplementary election with a view that our opponent is politically paralyzed by now; rather, we must work towards capturing at least 90 per cent of the vote. Our aim is to get 30000 out of the 31000 PVC holders of the 40000 registered voters in the affected areas; whether our opponents are ready or not is secondary.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Adeyemi, however, praised his party members for their supports and solidarity, especially in the last election, calling on them to finish the race with a wider margin.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“I sincerely thank you for your support and solidarity in the last Saturday outing, my full address will be after the rerun election is concluded.</i></p>

        <i>“But for now, let us resume with more vigour and determination our efforts towards the November 30 supplementary election. Let us go from house to house to mobilize people out for the exercise. We must give the election our all.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>It would be recalled that INEC had on Sunday, November 17, declared the Kogi West rerun election inconclusive. The supplementary election is to be conducted on November 30, in 53 polling units.</p>
      <p>According to INEC data, 48,101 are the registered voters in the affected areas, but 30,730 are those who have collected their PVC.</p>
      <p>Adeyemi had already polled 80,118, while Melaye scored 59,548 giving a margin of 20,670 difference.</p>
