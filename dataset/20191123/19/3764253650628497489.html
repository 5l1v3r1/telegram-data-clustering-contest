      </p>
      <p>Apparently determined to reconcile its aggrieved members, the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has adopted the recommendation of the national caucus that President Muhammadu Buhari should constitute a national reconciliation committee.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> reports that the party in a thread of tweets on its twitter page on Friday, November 22, said the standing committee would be empowered to address grievances of party members and resolve existing conflicts with a view to fostering unity and oneness within the party.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the decision was one of the highlights of the party's NEC meeting held on Friday, November 22, at the party's national secretariat, Abuja.</p>

      <p>President Buhari had said in his address that he would not seek for a third term in office, having sworn to uphold the constitution, which provides for two terms.</p>
      <p>He equally charged all APC members, leaders and elected officials to reposition themselves in their respective constituencies so as to sustain the administration's landmark legacies beyond 2023.</p>
      <p>The president said history would not be fair to members if the APC collapses after his second term, saying that history would be fair to the APC if the party remains strong and not only hold the centre but make gains.</p>

      <p>Buhari also urged the members to read the party's constitution, abide by the provisions in it and ensure that they do not take the trust of their constituents for granted.</p>
