      <h1>SS-Cong-NCP move SC, seek order for floor test tomorrow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/ashish-tripathi" target="_blank">Ashish Tripathi</a></address>
      <p>In a day of swift political developments, three parties Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress moved the Supreme Court challenging validity of Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari's "brazen action" to invite BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis to form the government.</p>
      <p>The parties, claiming to have the support of more than 144 MLAs to form govt under leadership of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, asked the top court to quash the Governor's decision as "unconstitutional, arbitrary, illegal, void-ab-initio, and violative of Article 14 of Constitution".</p>
      <p>They sought a direction from the court for conducting the floor test on Sunday with the nomination of a pro-tem Speaker as happened in the case of Karnataka Assembly in 2018.Â </p>
      <p>It was all the more necessary to avoid "further horse-trading and illegal manoeuvres to somehow cobble up a majority from the Maha Vikas Agadi formed by the three parties, they said, further, maintaining that the seven-day time granted to Fadnavis government to prove majority was completely illegal.</p>
      <p>The petition has yet not been filed as the lawyers were waiting for the SC registry officials till the time of filing the report.</p>
      <p>The joint petition, settled by senior advocate Devadatt Kamat and drafted by advocate Sunil Fernandes, Rajesh Inamdar, among others, would seek urgent and immediate hearing this night.</p>
      <p>"The BJP clearly falls short of the halfway mark of 144. In any event, the BJP cannot get the support of majority through legal constitutional means in the face of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule," they said.</p>
      <p>The parties sought a direction for summoning a special session of the 14th Maharashtra Legislative Assembly with the only agenda of administering the oath to the MLAs, immediately followed by the holding of a floor test on November 24.</p>
      <p>The petitioners relied upon the top court's order passed on May 17, 2018, in case of Karnataka Assembly and sought a direction to the Governor to furnish records related to an invitation to Fadnavis to form the government on November 23.</p>
      <p>"The action of the Governor in installing a minority Government is ex facie against the basic rule of law and the rule of parliamentary democracy i.e. rule by majority," they said.</p>
