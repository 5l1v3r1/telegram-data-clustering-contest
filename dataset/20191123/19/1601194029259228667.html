      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/liverpool">Liverpool</a> travelled to Selhurst Park to face <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday, looking to extend their unbeaten run in the Premier League. The Red had won 11 of their 12 games in the league, with the draw at Old Trafford the only game where they had dropped points so far. Jurgen Klopp's team were also 8 points clear at the top of the table and arrived into the game on the back of an impressive 3-1 win over reigning Premier League champions Manchester City at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The Eagles, on the other hand, had started the season brilliantly, but their good form had eluded them in the last 4 games, where they had 3 defeats and a draw. As a result, Palace had dropped down the league table and were in danger of sliding further down against a free-scoring Liverpool side. For Jurgen Klopp, this was a chance to maintain the gap between his team and the rest of the league and the Liverpool boss named his team accordingly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Liverpool Starting XI: </i>
        </b>
        <i>Alisson; Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dejan Lovren, Virgil Van Dijk, Andrew Robertson; Jordan Henderson, Fabinho, Georginio Wijnaldum; Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</i>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool were the better team at the start, but the home side grew into the game as the match progressed. The first half ended 0-0. After the break, the away side took the lead through Sadio Mane in the 49th minute. Palace equalized through Wilfred Zaha in the 82nd minute, but Roberto Firmino restored the away side’s lead 3 minutes later. Liverpool ultimately went on to secure 3 points and here are 5 talking points from the game.</p>

      <p>The Eagles were on the back foot for the opening minutes of the game, as Liverpool piled on the pressure looking for an early goal. Jurgen Klopp’s wards drove at the home side with intent, moving the ball well and keeping control of the proceeding. However, Crystal Palace were resolute at the back and denied the Reds any clear cut opportunities. After weathering the initial storm, Palace began to gather their footing in the game.</p>
      <p>The home side used a more direct approach and attempted to catch Liverpool on the break. Their confidence grew with every passing minute and they even had a couple of good chances to score in the first half.</p>
      <p>The best of the lot fell to Jordan Ayew, who missed a glorious opportunity to put the home team ahead. The home team also had more than a few chances to score after the break as well.</p>
      <p>Even though they ultimately lost the game, for the majority of the day, Crystal Palace managed to match Liverpool stride for stride and gave an impressive account of themselves.</p>
