      <p>Salah was forced to withdraw from international duty with Egypt during the recent break due to an ongoing ankle injury, only returning to training with Liverpool on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The forward was subsequently left out of the starting lineup for this afternoon's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-roberto-firmino-nets-winner-for-liverpool-at-palace_380355.html">2-1 win</a> over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, but Klopp has confirmed that he will be back available for the Reds' next outing.</p>
      <p>"Mo couldn't train for nine days - he trained 60-70% the other day and yesterday was the first day he was 100%. We had to make the decision whether to start him or not and we didn't start him," Klopp told reporters during his post-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to bring him on, but then we scored and so we could rest him today. Wednesday he will be back."</p>
      <p>Salah has scored nine goals in 17 appearances across all competitions so far this season.</p>
