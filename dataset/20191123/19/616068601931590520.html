      <p>The annual 'Light Up the Vines' event is back in Summerland next weekend, and they held a sneak peek Saturday to show off what people can expect. </p>
      <p>"It's our ninth annual event, it's a great way for us to kick off the holiday season and invite everybody to Summerland to take in all the festivities," explained Donita Dyer, coordinator for the Bottleneck Drive Association. </p>
      <p>"We've got lights in the orchards on the vines, we've got people doing special discounts, seasonal tastings, we've got bonfires, we've got a little bit of everything."</p>
      <p>In the Bottleneck Drive area of Summerland, 18 wineries, three cideries, a brewery and a distillery all open and decorated for the event, which takes place Nov. 30 and Dec. 1 from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m.</p>
      <p>Participants are encouraged to book a tour or drive responsibly around the area themselves, stopping in at the various locations. </p>
      <p>Dyer says they are expecting thousands of visitors around their various locations. </p>
      <p>"Last year our numbers were higher than all our years before," she said. "We love to invite people to Summerland."</p>
