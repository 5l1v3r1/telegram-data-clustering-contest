      <p>Humanity could be on the verge of answering the biggest question in the universe.</p>
      <p>A Nasa-backed study has claimed that alien life could be found on an ‘exoplanet’ outside our own system within a few decades.</p>
      <p>Researchers have just published a proposal paper calling for an observatory to be placed on the dark side of the moon.</p>
      <p>The proposed FARSIDE instrument (Farside Array for Radio Science Investigations of the Dark ages and Exoplanets) would scan the sky and look for habitable planets capable of sustaining extraterrestrial organisms.</p>
      <p>It would also search for Planet 9, a mysterious and as-yet-undiscovered world believed to be lurking in the furthest reaches of the solar system, as well as trying to find dark matter, a substance believed to make up a large proportion of all the matter in the universe.</p>
      <p>As well as these impressive ambitions, the overachieving instrument would ‘explore how the universe began and evolved’ and look for ‘coronal mass ejections’ – outbursts from the surface of stars.</p>

      <p>But the goal which is likely to get the most attention is the search for exoplanets capable of sustaining life.</p>

      <p>To do this, FARSIDE would scour the sky for evidence of planets which have a magnetic field like our own, which is considered ‘a key ingredient for planetary habitability’, as well as looking for gases and other ‘biosignatures’ indicating the presence of alien organisms.</p>
      <p>Authors of the paper include scientists from Nasa as well as academics from various American universities.</p>
      <p>They wrote: ‘The discovery of life on a planet outside our solar system is at the heart of Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate.</p>
      <p>‘Such a discovery may arrive within the next few decades and is the focus of a number of planned and concept Nasa missions.</p>
      <p>‘The most likely avenue involves spectral observations of biosignature gases… on an Earth-like planet orbiting a nearby star.’</p>
      <p>Nasa has not committed to building FARSIDE, which would consist of 128 antennae spread across the dark side of the moon – a location which would shield the observatory from radio frequencies produced by Earthbound human civilisation as well as ‘noise’ created by the sun’s solar wind.</p>
