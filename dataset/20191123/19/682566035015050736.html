      <p>Milan -Â <b>Gonzalo Higuain </b>grabbed a second-half brace to fire <b>Juventus</b> to a 3-1 win at<b> Atalanta</b> that kept the champions top of Serie A on Saturday, while Napoli extended their winless league run to five games with a lacklustre 1-1 draw at AC Milan.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri's Juve left it late to seal victory in Bergamo after Robin Gosens had nodded Atalanta ahead after 56 minutes.</p>
      <p>But Higuain hit back with two goals in eight minutes before Dybala marked his 200th Serie A appearance with the third goal one minute into injury time.</p>
      <p>Juve open up a four-point lead on second-placed Inter Milan, who travel to Torino later on Saturday, as Atalanta drop to sixth place after their fourth league game without a win.</p>
      <p>"We suffered, but in the final 20 minutes we gave everything we had to bring the win home," said Sarri.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo missed the trip despite his four-goal spree for Portugal as he recovers from a knee problem ahead of Juve's Champions League game against Atletico Madrid.</p>
      <p>"I hope Cristiano will be back for the Champions League on Tuesday," said Sarri.</p>
      <p>"We're solving this knee problem that has been bothering him for a while. Playing with a hint of pain will tire you out psychologically.</p>
      <p>"So far he has trained in the right way, so as not to overload his knee."</p>
      <p>Higuain pulled Juventus level after 74 minutes with a ball that took a deflection off Rafael Toloi to beat Pierluigi Gollini in the Atalanta goal.</p>
      <p>The Argentine completed his double when he picked up a cross from Juan Cuadrado, who had put his hand on the ball during a sliding tackle at the start of the move.</p>
      <p>Then Dybala broke through the Atalanta defense to score his fourth Serie A goal this season.</p>
      <p>"It was a great test of maturity in a difficult field, three fundamental points for the championship," said Higuain.</p>
      <p>Atalanta had their chances, with Musa Barrow missing an early penalty as the Bergamo side chased their first Serie A win over Juventus since February 2001.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Gambian rattled the crossbar after 17 minutes after a spot-kick was awarded for a Sami Khedira handball.</p>
      <p>"Atalanta had perhaps their best performance this season and deserved to win, until that unlucky equaliser, then everything changed," said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini.</p>
      <p>"That was the turning point. In the end, the quality of Juve overturned the result".</p>
      <p>Atalanta lost out on some refereeing decisions including a disputed Emre Can handball, which did not result in a penalty.</p>
      <p>"I saw the action again. There is so much confusion nowadays on handball," said Gasperini.</p>
      <p>"The penalty we were awarded was the kind of challenge I'd have been furious to see given against me.</p>
      <p>"The interpretations are completely different between players and referees. If there is no clarity, it becomes a lottery."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the pressure is mounting on Napoli coach Carlo Ancelotti ahead of his side's Champions League trip to Liverpool midweek following their disappointing performance at the San Siro.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up for the past two seasons, Napoli sit are seventh, 15 points behind Juve after 13 games and the stalemate is a poor result for a team that had title ambitions in the summer.</p>
      <p>Milan are struggling in 13th position with just one point from their last three games.</p>
      <p>Napoli's Hirving Lozano got his head to a rebound after Lorenzo Insigne rattled the post after 24 minutes.</p>
      <p>But five minutes later Giacomo Bonaventura blasted in the equaliser to confirm his return from injury with his first goal in over a year.</p>
