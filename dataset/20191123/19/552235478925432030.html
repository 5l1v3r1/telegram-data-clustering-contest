      <h2>The new Easter Road gaffer is thrilled with how his players played during his first game in charge.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:22:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author">Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Hibs manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> has revealed his delight at how his players performed during their win over Motherwell.</p>
      <p>The hosts turned in a free-flowing display to sweep Motherwell aside 3-1, with goals from Christian Doidge, Florian Kamberi and Daryl Horgan cancelling out Liam Polworth's early opener.</p>
      <p>Ross admits he was reluctant to make wholesale changes - either tactical or in terms of personnel - but he was delighted by the response to his demand for an attacking performance.</p>
      <p>"It does help to get off to a good start - it helps to get that buy-in from the players," said Ross, who was named as Hibs' head coach on November 15.</p>
      <p>"I'm pleased because there were parts of the performance which were very good.</p>

      <p>"I'm still trying to get a feel for the players but we got little bits of information across and the players took that on board very well.</p>
      <p>"It was hard work for them to play the way we wanted and be as brave as we wanted in forward areas, so I'm delighted."</p>
      <p>The win sees <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> immediately ascend into the top-six and Ross is adamant that must be a springboard for the rest of the campaign, insisting the squad he has inherited possesses the ability to surge up the standings.</p>
      <p>"The first starting point for us this season was to get into that [top-six] area of the table," added Ross following his first week in the job.</p>
      <p>"This win takes us there immediately but we need to build from that and take it forward.</p>
      <p>"However, there are some very good players here, I'm not coming into a group that doesn't have ability - they have lots of that.</p>
      <p>"And it's a good squad in terms of their willingness to listen and learn. I'm really encouraged by that and excited. We have a lot of creativity and potential in that team who can score goals."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> had cause for grievance in the second period when Ryan Porteous appeared to haul down Polwarth in side the box, only for John Beaton to wave away the pleas for a penalty. With the score balance at 2-1 at the time, that would have been a game-changer.</p>
      <p>However, Steelmen boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stephen-robinson">Stephen Robinson,</a> to his credit, refused to blame that call for his side's defeat.</p>
      <p>Robinson said: "I can't control that or what referees do; I can control if players stay with runners and we didn't do that.</p>
      <p>"Whether we should have had a penalty or not? I don't know. But we certainly didn't lose the game because of that. Football's about what you do in both boxes."</p>
