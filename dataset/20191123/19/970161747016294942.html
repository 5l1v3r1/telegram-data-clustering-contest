      <p>Adam previously competed on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> in 2016, and came third to winner Scarlett Moffatt and his Extra Camp co-host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joel-dommett/">Joel Dommett</a>.</p>
      <p>While his professional life in soapland is well-known, let’s take a closer look at his private life ahead of his next appearance on our screens.</p>

      <p>Adam Thomas does not have a girlfriend, but he does have a wife called Caroline whom he married in 2017.</p>
      <p>The ex-Waterloo Road star has two children with Caroline called Teddy, born in 2014, and Elsie-Rose, born in 2017.</p>

      <p>It was first reported that Adam would be joining I’m A Celebrity: Extra Camp in August, with a source telling The Sun: ‘Adam showed how brilliant he was on camera during his time on the show and has plenty of TV experience from his years as an actor.</p>

      <p>Fans took to Twitter earlier this week to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-a-celebrity-extra-camp-host-adam-thomas-branded-creepy-by-fans-as-he-chats-up-crew-on-show-11186711/">brand Adam ‘creepy’</a> after he appeared to chat up a crew member on camera during a segment for an upcoming trial called Just Desserts.</p>
      <p>‘Right, first things first,’ Adam said to Molly the crew member. ‘What’s your number?’</p>

      <p>It appeared to all be in jest, and the segment moved on to talk about the, erm, food, however one fan wrote: ‘Adam Thomas hitting on the trial woman and his whole encounter with her was just creepy.’</p>
      <p>Another added: ‘Adam Thomas! Bit inappropriate.’</p>
