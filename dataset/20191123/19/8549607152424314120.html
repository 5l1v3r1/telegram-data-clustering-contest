        <b>Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance cryptocurrency exchange, has vowed to sue <i>The Block Crypto</i>, a cryptocurrency news website for reporting that Binance’s office in Shanghai was shut down abruptly after a police raid. CZ believes that the news contributed partly to bitcoin’s most recent price slump, reports <i>Micky</i> on November 23, 2019.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>CZ Intends to Sue Cryptocurrency Website</h3>
      <p>Per the <a href="https://micky.com.au/furious-cz-from-binance-suing-the-block-over-market-tanking-fake-news/">report</a>, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) intends to sue <i>The Block</i> after the media publicized that Binance’s office in Shangai had been raided by the police, and then shut down.</p>
      <p>According to CZ, <i>The Block’s</i> claim is “irresponsible” “fake news,” which calls for an apology.</p>
      <p>Binance’s representative who spoke to <u><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/crypto-exchange-binance-says-no-shanghai-office-amid-raid-rumors?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_source=twitter">Bloomberg</a></u> also affirmed that news of the shutdown is false, and the crypto exchange’s office in Shanghai has not been in operation for the past two years.</p>
      <p><i>The Block</i>, on the other hand, has amended the<u><a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/47922/binances-shanghai-office-shut-down-following-police-raid-sources-say"> story</a></u>, by stating that the office was shut down “following a visit by authorities” instead of “following a police raid.”</p>
      <p>Also, the media claimed that about 50 to 100 employees who worked in the office were forced to “either work remotely or relocate to Singapore.”</p>
      <h4>Media Stands Its Ground on Story</h4>
      <p>While CZ was only concerned that the media had triggered massive fear uncertainty and doubt (FUD) in the minds of crypto traders, the CEO became infuriated when Frank Chaparro, <i>The Block’s</i> news director, took it one step further to add credibility to the story.</p>
      <p>In a 1400 worded piece, Chaparro said several sources had visited Binance’s Shanghai office, including Caijing.com, a Chinese media outlet that reportedly visited Binance’s premises on October 29, 2019, and November 2, 2019, after it was closed down.</p>
      <p>“Binance’s denial of the mere existence of a Chinese office comes despite <i>The Block</i> having seen photographs of the office as part of conversations with Binance representatives about the location in question,” <i>The Block</i> said.</p>
      <p>The publication also claimed that CZ had worked from the building this year, and news about the police’s visit was leaked by a Binance employee, who had allegedly revealed reliable information about the Malta-based exchange in the past.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, <i>The Block’s</i> publication about Binance spread a wave of speculation on Twitter, and as such, it is part of the reason behind bitcoin’s 8.4% dump on the same day.</p>
      <p>Another reason that can be linked to the virtual asset’s dip is news emerging from China.</p>
      <p>China’s central bank has <a href="http://finance.caixin.com/2019-11-15/101483968.html">ordered</a> the probe of crypto-related activities in Shanghai, while the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) issued a warning on November 22, 2019, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/22/stark-china-warning-causes-bitcoin-to-suddenly-crash-10-as-other-major-cryptos-nosedive/#11c0a9f953d4">stating</a> that it will be cracking down hard on bitcoin and cryptocurrency trades in China.</p>
      <p>Also, Focus Report, a Chinese media outlet has <a href="http://tv.cctv.com/2019/11/18/VIDEBqdjIAO4YI2hGxTjSXNz191118.shtml">revealed</a> that at least 755 tokens in the Chinese market are not backed by the distributed ledger technology or real initiatives, which shows the height of fraud in the crypto space.</p>
      <p>Amidst these setbacks, <i>BTCManager</i> <a href="https://btcmanager.com/chinas-pboc-official-educates-cryptos-libra/?q=/chinas-pboc-official-educates-cryptos-libra/&amp;">informed</a> on November 18, 2019, that a PBOC Official is educating people in China about cryptocurrencies and Facebook’s Libra.</p>
