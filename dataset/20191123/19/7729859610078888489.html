        <b>Munster and Racing 92 were forced to share the points at Thomond Park in Champions Cup Pool 4, after playing out a thrilling 21-21 draw.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Racing played some stunning rugby in the first period, with Finn Russell and Teddy Thomas conjuring up superb tries, while Juan Imhoff added a third Racing try in the second half after more good play from Russell.</p>
      <p>Keith Earls and Andrew Conway scored tries for Munster, while out-half JJ Hanrahan kicked three penalties and a superb touchline conversion to level things, but he missed a close-range drop-goal attempt in the final minute.</p>
      <p>The result was Munster's first European Cup draw at Thomond Park in their history, with still just four defeats over the past 24 years.</p>
