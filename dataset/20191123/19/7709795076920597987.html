        <b>Manchester City came from behind to keep themselves within nine points of Premier League leaders Liverpool with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Chelsea.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All the goals in an open contest at the Etihad Stadium came in the first half as the champions responded to N'Golo Kante's early strike with goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez.</p>
      <p>Raheem Sterling thought he had added a late third for City but his injury-time strike was ruled out for offside in a very tight VAR call.</p>

      <p>Sergio Aguero hit the woodwork before the break but the game ended with concern for City's record goalscorer after he hobbled off 13 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>City spurned a number of chances to kill off the game in the second half but the Londoners could not get back into the game and were leapfrogged in the table by the hosts, who moved third.</p>

      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Manchester City have won four Premier League games against Chelsea despite conceding the first goal, more than they have vs any other opponent in the competition.</li>
        <li>While Chelsea have scored more away goals than any other Premier League side this season (19), no side has conceded more on the road than the Blues in 2019-20 (14).</li>
        <li>Manchester City have conceded the first goal in three of their last four home league games, as many as they had in their previous 51 at the Etihad.</li>
        <li>Chelsea’s last four Premier League defeats have been against last season’s top six, including all three so far this season (2 v Liverpool, 1 v Man City, 1 v Man Utd).</li>
        <li>Chelsea didn’t manage a single shot on target after their 21st minute goal in this match.</li>
        <li>Manchester City’s possession of 46.74 is the lowest recorded by a side managed by Pep Guardiola in any of his 381 top-flight matches in charge.</li>
        <li>Man City’s Kevin de Bruyne has been involved in more home goals than any other player in the Premier League this season (9 – 3 goals, 6 assists).</li>
        <li>Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante has scored with all three of his shots on target in the Premier League this season. The Frenchman has scored in three of his last four games in the competition.</li>
        <li>Riyad Mahrez has been directly involved in 10 goals in his 11 starts in all competitions for Man City this season (4 goals, 6 assists).</li>

      <h3>1924: FT Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea</h3>
      <p>
        <b>⚽️ 21' - Kante</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>⚽️ 29' - De Bruyne</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>⚽️ 37' - Mahrez</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first-half goals decide it as City bounce back from their defeat at Liverpool. Report, highlights and stats to follow...</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1922: GOAL DENIED!</h3>
      <p>City go down the other end and Sterling has the ball in the back of net, cue celebrations...but VAR has different ideas. One of those fine, fine margins with part of Sterling's body being shown by these...skewed lines. But it won't matter anyway, because that's full-time.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1920: Chelsea chance (2-1)</h3>
      <p>Frank Lampard's side get a free-kick from around 30 yards and it looks a little too far. Mason Mount gets the thumbs up to shoot and his effort is brilliant, to be far, but just wide of the target.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1918: Four minutes added on (2-1)</h3>
      <p>City really digging in now, defending well to deny Pulisic as the board goes up for stoppage time. Four minutes.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1913: City to see it out? (2-1)</h3>
      <p>As they continue to look for a third, there's some tired bodies out there and City look in control now, they have four minutes plus stoppage time to see it out.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1907: Willian goes close! (2-1)</h3>
      <p>The Brazilian nearly scored early in the game and this time he flashes a volley from the edge of the box just over the bar. The replay shows that compatriot Ederson got a fingertip to it. Just over 10 to go.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1900: Chelsea sub (2-1)</h3>
      <p>Here come the subs. Batshuayi and Mount on, Jorginho and Abraham off.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1859: Foden's impact (2-1)</h3>
      <p>Phil Foden has come on in place of David Silva who appeared to have an issue and the England U21 midfielder has looked lively, just creating space on the edge of the box before shooting at Kepa. Somehow there has not been a goal in this second half yet.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1844: City chugging away (2-1)</h3>
      <p>The hosts have a couple of corners and for the second it is a well-worked move which finds Joao Cancelo from around eight yards. He divers it towards the far post and Chelsea get vital bodies in the way. City are relentless and Aguero is soon in the box, but his effort is blocked asnd it comes to nothing.</p>
      <p>City are <b><a href="https://m.skybet.com/football/football-live/event/24966170?aff=688&amp;dcmp=SL_ED_FOOTBALL_SATURDAYTIPS_2111">8/11 to score the game's next goal</a></b> and you cannot argue with that.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1843: Raincheck (2-1)</h3>
      <p>It's chucking it down at the Etihad. The surface is slippery and it's ideal for those daisy-cutter shots which are nightmares for goalkeepers to deal with.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1836: Mahrez goes close (2-1)</h3>
      <p>The Algerian makes another dangerous run inside from the left, dropping a shoulder and going past two men. He is slightly stretched and at speed and flashes it just wide of the post.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1833: Second half! (2-1)</h3>
      <p>We are back underway. Here's hoping for more of the same. As it stands, City go third, leapfrogging Chelsea and staying within nine points of leaders Liverpool and one behind Leicester.</p>

        <figcaption>Riyad Mahrez: Manchester City winger celebrates his goal against Chelsea</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>That's the interval. Much needed after an entertaining first half.</p>
      <p>It has been end-to-end, chances for both sides and it was N'Golo Kante who gave Chelsea the lead after 21 minutes.</p>
      <p>With a bit of luck, Kevin De Bruyne drew the hosts level on the half-hour and eight minutes later a moment of brilliance from Riyad Mahrez, a trademark finish, saw the champions take the lead.</p>
      <p>All to play for in the second half!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1815: Crossed lines (2-1)</h3>
      <p>City make another dangerous attack, Sterling down the left, and it falls to David Silva in the box. A lapse in concentration sees the Spaniard pass it back to Sterling who is offside. Half-time closing in.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1813: Aguero goes close! (2-1)</h3>
      <p>The Argentinian rattles the crossbar after Kepa's mishit clearance finds him on the edge of the box.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1811: City penalty denied (2-1)</h3>
      <p>A penalty check denies Man City a penalty after Aguero tangles with Tomori.</p>

      <h3>1808: GOAL! Manchester City 2-1 Chelsea (Mahrez)</h3>
      <p>A great goal from Riyad Mahrez puts the hosts ahead. He beats two defenders, comes inside and slides it into the far corner. Wonderful.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1758: GOAL! Manchester City 1-1 Chelsea (De Bruyne)</h3>
      <p>Our BTTS in the first half tip comes off.</p>
      <p>Man City get some good fortune. David Silva's ball is deflected into the path of De Bruyne on the edge of the box and the Belgian's subsequent shot is then deflected past Kepa.</p>
      <p>They needed that and De Bruyne has been spritely. Game on!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1751: GOAL! Manchester City 0-1 Chelsea (Kante)</h3>
      <p>His run from midfield was an early threat and City did not learn as Kante gives the visitors the lead with his third goal in six Premier League appearances. Kovacic's through-ball was delightful. Their three of Kante, Kovacic and Jorginho has worked brilliantly so far with Mount dropped to the bench.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1750: In-play advice (0-0)</h3>
      <p>No goals yet but BTTS at 5/6 still looks a great price.</p>
      <p>Chelsea to have 5+ shots on target looks good at 2/1 - they have already had one.</p>
      <p>

      <hr/>
      <h3>1745: Another Chelsea chance! (0-0)</h3>
      <p>City fail to clear a set piece and it drops for Tomori who flashes a shot just past the post. He punches the floor in frustration - the England defender thinks he should have done better with that one. A great watch so far.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1741: Kante loses his marker (0-0)</h3>
      <p>N'Golo Kante makes a run in behind the City defence, Jorginho slides it through and the flag stays down. He turns inside the chasing defender, lays off Abraham who goes close from the edge of the box. Positive from Lampard's men.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1738: End-to-end (0-0)</h3>
      <p>Chelsea get a chance at the other end as Willian slides it just wide of the post after getting ahead of Mendy. Intriguing opening 10 minutes or so!</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1736: City openings (0-0)</h3>
      <p>Man City finding plenty of space on the counter, this time Aguero with loads of time running through the middle. De Bruyne is found again but he cannot get a shot off. The champions looking sharp so far.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1734: Man City chance (0-0)</h3>
      <p>A slick City move sees De Bruyne put through on the right of the box and he slides a shot across goal and just past the post. A wake-up call for the visitors.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>1730: Kick off!</h3>
      <p>Here we go at the Etihad - the battle of the Blues!</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's side know Liverpool won at Palace, so they will not want to slip up. With Chelsea's form under Frank Lampard, it promises to be an intriguing clash.</p>
      <hr/>

      <h3>1720: Team news</h3>
      <p>Ederson returns in goal for Manchester City as the champions hosted Chelsea in the evening game at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>City made five changes in all with Joao Cancelo, Benjamin Mendy, Riyad Mahrez and David Silva all coming in. Fernandinho was again paired in defence with John Stones.</p>
      <p>Jorginho returned from suspension for Chelsea and captain Cesar Azpilicueta was recalled. Christian Pulisic proved his fitness after a groin injury.</p>

      <h3>1718: Good evening!</h3>
      <p>Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the big game in the Premier League - Man City v Chelsea at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>I am George Pitts, keeping you company for the action.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's Manchester City will be hoping to bounce back from their disappointing defeat at Anfield last time out, to avoid falling even further behind in the title race - they are currently nine points adrift of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>The Citizens have already lost more times in the opening 12 games of this term than during their entire 100-point campaign in 2017/18 and slipped to fourth, below the visitors. The trip to the north-west will be a big test for Frank Lampard's youthful Blues.</p>
      <p>They will be hoping to continue their red-hot form by winning a seventh successive Premier League match.</p>
      <p>If you joined us from the 3pm blog, thank you. If you joined us just for this match, welcome!</p>
      <p>Sit back and enjoy as we keep you across the big game with updates, goal flashes, images, betting advice, stats and much more.</p>
      <p>Our tips will follow shortly, but first a recap of today's results - a couple of managers will no doubt be nervously looking over their shoulder now...</p>
