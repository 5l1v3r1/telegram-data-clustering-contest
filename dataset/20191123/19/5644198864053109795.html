      <p>HONG KONG: Hong Kong's protest movement called on Saturday (Nov 23) for citizens not to disrupt district council elections in which some parties hope to send a message to the city's Beijing-backed government.</p>
      <p>There have been no major rallies or violent clashes between police and protesters in the run-up to Sunday's district polls, a rare respite for a city roiled by nearly six months of political unrest.</p>

      <p>Amid concerns that violence could cause authorities to delay the polls, first-time voters have been advised online to avoid spoiling their ballots, while protest forums have urged an orderly ballot.</p>
      <p>Postings by users on the popular board LiHKG urged voters to go to polling stations early and for supporters "not to jeopardise the election".</p>

      <p>Polls will open on Sunday morning in the semi-autonomous city of 7.5 million.</p>
      <p>The district council polls have in the past generated little passion, dominated by candidates allied to the China-backed government with a remit over more mundane matters as rubbish collections and planning decisions.</p>
      <p>But with protests coursing through the city, some candidates are hoping to make a statement to Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the pro-Beijing government, which have refused to concede to protesters' demands.</p>

      <p>The poll to choose 452 councillors across 18 districts is the closest voters in Hong Kong get to direct representation - but turnout is usually unremarkable.</p>
      <p>Nearly 400,000 new voters have registered, however, which is widely interpreted as a positive sign for the pro-democracy camp.</p>
      <p>An unprecedented police presence will be deployed at polling stations and on the city streets on Sunday to prevent any drama.</p>
      <p>
        <b>"EVERY VOTE MATTERS"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lam's Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung called on citizens to let the polls proceed smoothly.</p>
      <p>"If you create massive chaos or carry out unlawful deeds it will be difficult to hold a fair election," Cheung said.</p>
      <p>"It's a real democratic exercise. I really want people to treasure it."</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's political unrest billowed out in June in opposition to a Bill that would allow extraditions to China.</p>
      <p>Although the Bill was eventually withdrawn, the movement snowballed into wider calls for democracy and investigations into alleged police brutality.</p>

      <p>Protester Chow Pak-kwan, a 21-year-old who lost a kidney and part of his liver after being shot by a traffic police officer earlier this month, on Saturday echoed the calls for "peaceful" elections.</p>
      <p>"I hope Hong Kong people can cast their votes to earn more democracy in a peaceful way," Chow Pak-kwan, masked and dressed in the black colours of the city's protest movement, told reporters.</p>
      <p>"Every vote matters."</p>
      <p>In a sign of mistrust between much of the public and the authorities, polling authorities on Saturday issued a statement to knock down rumours that facial recognition technology would be installed at polling stations.</p>
      <p>The district polls remain the city's freest. In contrast, members of the city's legislature are elected by a mix of popular vote and industry groups stacked with Beijing loyalists.</p>
      <p>The city's chief executive is chosen by a similarly pro-establishment committee.</p>
      <p>Political analysts expect pro-democracy candidates to make gains in the district councils, but to still fall well short of a majority of the 452 slots.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CAMPUS UNDER SIEGE</b>
      </p>
      <p>At Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a protester by the name of Ah Chung was still holding out.</p>
      <p>Clad in a face mask and a red Polytechnic University track suit, he vowed to stay for the duration.</p>
      <p>"I’ll continue to stay here, but hopefully not forever," he said with a touch of humour.</p>

      <p>Few protesters were still visible on the campus, and a visiting lawmaker said their number was so small that there is no need for the police to enter the campus.</p>
      <p>Many of the remaining protesters were in hiding, fearful of possible arrest and wary of those urging surrender, said Woo Kwok Wang, the 22-year-old acting president of the university's student union.</p>
      <p>Woo said he had been on the campus since Wednesday to provide support for the students, and would only leave when he felt his help was no longer needed.</p>
      <p>A social worker who gave his name only as Sendon said he had crossed paths with four protesters on Saturday and was concerned about their mental state.</p>
      <p>"They’ve been in this highly stressful environment for so long, over 120 hours, and they have no easy way to release this stress," he said.</p>
      <p>About 1,000 people have been arrested or registered by police in the university siege, about 300 of them younger than 18.</p>
      <p>Police have set up high plastic barricades and a fence on the perimeter of the campus. Towards midday, officers appeared at ease, allowing citizens to mill about the edges of the cordon as neighbourhood shops opened for business.</p>
      <p>Some roads next to the campus had reopened by Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Scores of construction workers worked at the mouth of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel, closed for more than a week after it was first blockaded, to repair toll booths smashed by protesters and clear debris from approach roads.</p>
