      <h1>Ryan Day Being Called Out For Play-Calling vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:51:29+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Ryan Day has faced basically no criticism in Year 1 of his head coaching tenure at Ohio State. The Buckeyes are 10-0 and have dominated everyone they’ve faced, after all. That’s changing today, though.</p>
      <p>Ohio State led by 21 points at halftime vs. Penn State, but the Nittany Lions have stormed back in the second half. It’s now Ohio State 21, Penn State 17 at the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes have had multiple disastrous turnovers and Day is being criticized for conservative play-calling.</p>
      <p>Ohio State has opted for several runs, including some by quarterback Justin Fields, in key situations. The big plays the Buckeyes have had all season have disappeared in the second half.</p>
      <p>Urban Meyer was often criticized for similar play-calls in big games, most notably against Michigan State in 2015.</p>

      <p>Thankfully for the Buckeyes, they still have Chase Young, who’s been a wrecking ball on defense all game long.</p>
      <p>Ohio State still leads Penn State at the beginning of the fourth quarter. The game is on FOX.</p>
