      <h1>US Navy Chief Wants to Review SEAL Gallagher's Status Despite Trump's Opposition</h1>
      <h2>Previously, POTUS stated that he would not allow Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher to be stripped of his Navy SEAL Trident Pin after being restored to his rank by presidential clemency.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T19:55:14+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author">by Tim Korso</a></address>
      <p>US Navy Secretary Richard Spencer has stated that in his opinion, a five-member Navy panel still <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911211077364417-court-martialed-navy-seal-faces-removal-from-elite-special-force-after-trump-restores-his-rank/">needs review the SEAL status of Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher</a>, who was convicted due to misconduct, but later pardoned by US President Donald Trump.</p>
      <blockquote>"I believe the process matters for good order and discipline […] I think we have a process in place, which we're going forward with, and that's my job", Spencer said.</blockquote>
      <p>The Navy secretary’s remarks are not in tune with the recent statement by the US president, who has insisted that Gallagher will retain his status as a SEAL and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911211077370832-us-navy-seal-accused-of-war-crimes-will-retain-his-elite-rank-trump-vows/">slammed the handling of his case</a>, arguing that it was incorrect from the start.</p>

      <p>Spencer admitted that POTUS can disregard any decision that the panel might take in regard to Gallagher, but still aims to go ahead with the chosen course of action.</p>
      <blockquote>"The commander in chief is the commander in chief [...] and he can do what he wants", he stated.</blockquote>
      <h3>War Crime Accusations</h3>
      <p>Gallagher was stripped of his rank of chief officer after a court-martial <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908021076435026-us-navy-dismisses-criminal-case-against-seal-platoon-leader---report/">found him guilty of posing in a photo with a dead Daesh*</a> fighter, but acquitted him of murder during his deployment in Mosul, Iraq in 2017, which would have qualified as a war crime. The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911161077320841-trump-announces-pardons-for-us-soldiers-accused-of-war-crimes/">SEAL was recently restored to his previous rank</a> by a clemency issued by President Trump, who criticised the case against him as well as two other US servicemen for actually killing enemies of the US.</p>
      <p>POTUS' decision has reportedly caused a rift among US servicemen. Navy officials later notified Gallagher that his status as a SEAL may be reviewed by the panel on 5 December and that he could be stripped of the gold eagle Trident emblem worn by members of the elite unit.</p>
