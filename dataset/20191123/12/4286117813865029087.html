      <p>"The Governor is supposed to be non-partisan when takes the oath of the Constitution. The Maharashtra Governor connived with the BJP leaders and hatched a conspiracy," Ashok Gehlot said, adding, "After Haryana, the message given by the voters was clear but the BJP hasn't learnt its lessons."</p>
      <p>Ashok Gehlot said President Ram Nath Kovind should intervene immediately. "The BJP government should prove the majority as soon as possible. The Governor should not have done this," Ashok Gehlot said.</p>
      <p>"We criticise this act of PM Modi and Amit Shah. The Governor [Bhagat Singh Koshyari] is above any political party. He conspired this on the advice of PM Modi and Amit Shah. He shouldn't be on his post as he lost his face," Ashok Gehlot said.</p>

        <b>BJP 'CONTRACT KILLER' OF DEMOCRACY: CONGRESS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Slamming the new government in Maharashtra as "illegitimate", the Congress on Saturday termed the swearing-in of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister a black chapter in India's democracy and alleged that the Governor did not make effort to verify his claims of having the support of a majority of MLAs.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the BJP "scared" an "opportunist" Ajit Pawar, the NCP leader who has joined hands with the saffron party and acted as "contract killer" of democracy.</p>
      <p>Devendra Fadnavis had promised to put Ajit Pawar in jail but has made him deputy chief minister now, Randeep Surjewala said.</p>
