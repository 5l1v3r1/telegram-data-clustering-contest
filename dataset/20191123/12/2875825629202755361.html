      <h2>'We talk about a romantic break-up for weeks and comfort one another but we don’t openly discuss or grieve the end of this other relationship'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:24:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/ciara-phelan/" target="_blank">Ciara Phelan</a></address>
      <p>The chat around <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nadine-coyle">Nadine Coyle’s</a> friendship with the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/girls-aloud">Girls Aloud</a> crew is one of the reasons why I’m glued to watching her in the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">jungle this year.</a></p>
      <p>When the line-up was announced I was excited about the juicy gossip she would spill, especially about her “feud” with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cheryl">Cheryl.</a></p>
      <p>But then I saw how uncomfortable she appeared when campmates questioned her about the rumours which have circulated for years.</p>
      <p>And I realised that, in reality, the end of a friendship can be one of the most painful things to go through – and shouldn’t be seen as a form of entertainment for others.</p>
      <p>Friends come and go throughout your school years but once you hit your mid-20s, for a lot of people, especially women, that’s when you realise who deserves your loyalty.</p>
      <p>And I think the death of a friendship is something that can have a huge impact on your life at that time and it becomes a private ache for so many.</p>

      <p>We talk about a romantic break-up for weeks and comfort one another but we don’t openly discuss or grieve the end of this other relationship, which also needs attention in order to cope with.</p>
      <p>We have this idea that they should last forever, that the bond with your BFF is unbreakable but as a society we are woefully blinded by the concept of forever.</p>
      <p>But as you get older and wiser, you really begin to audit who and what kind of people you want by your side.</p>
      <p>Which is something I had to do not too long ago, when I learned to let go of one friend. I always knew deep down she wasn’t great to me despite the time and effort I gave to her, whether it be a listening ear or a shoulder to cry on.</p>
      <p>Looking back now, I know we were just mates for the convenience of others.</p>
      <p>And since letting her go, it has been a weight off my shoulders.</p>
      <p>It was frustrating and mentally draining for me because I never got anything back and felt taken advantage of as I treated her the same as I did all of my other friends.</p>
      <p>But it’s the relationships you don’t want to lose but feel you have no other option but to walk away from that can cut the deepest.</p>
      <p>The end of some friendships can be worse than a break-up, like losing a limb – especially if it’s sudden.</p>
      <p>And the special memories of what you shared are now tainted.</p>
      <p>But there comes a stage where you have to draw a line when you feel exhausted from trying to make it work and they don’t reach out to you when you need them the most.</p>
      <p>And to stop allowing yourself to constantly be hurt over efforts not being reciprocated.</p>
      <p>Yes, life can get in the way for a lot of people but if you value your friendship with someone you will always find the time to check in with them.</p>
      <p>People fall out, romance and careers can get in the way, but none of those should be any reason to neglect a true friendship.</p>
      <p>It’s only natural that some relationships have an expiry date, but when it gets to a point that you no longer recognise the person you once called a best friend then you shouldn’t feel guilty about walking away.</p>
      <p>And know it’s totally normal to grieve the end of a friendship like you would for a romantic relationship.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, those who care for you and appreciate your friendship are the ones who matter the most.</p>
      <p>But I’ve learned the lesson that we should all be more aware, gentle and acknowledge the difficulty of losing someone you believed would always be there for you.</p>
