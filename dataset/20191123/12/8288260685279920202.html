      <h1>'A fight formed' - Leeds United star reveals his role in that Aston Villa incident</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | AVFC drew 1-1 against Leeds in an action-packed clash in April</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Leeds United midfielder Pablo Hernandez has revealed the role he played in the bizarre goal Aston Villa scored at Elland Road.</p>
      <p>In what was a vital Championship promotion clash in April, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> went behind when Mateusz Klich scored despite Jonathan Kodjia being injured and awaiting treatment.</p>
      <p>The goal sparked fury and Anwar El-Ghazi was shown a red card after a clash with Patrick Bamford – although if was later rescinded with the Leeds striker being handed a ban.</p>
      <p>In response to his players’ unsportsmanlike behaviour Leeds head coach Marcelo Bielsa demanded they allow Villa to walk the ball into the net to equalise.</p>

      <p>Albert Adomah ran from the halfway line and slotted home, despite the best efforts of Swedish defender Pontus Jansson to prevent him doing so.</p>
      <p>Hernandez, it turns out, was the player who revealed Bielsa’s decision to the rest of his team-mates.</p>
      <p>“There was a lot of tension,” he said in an interview with Marca. “At the moment we got the goal a fight formed. I had a yellow and I didn’t want to take a chance.</p>
      <p>“At that time, Bielsa called me and transmitted to me, since we speak the same language, what he thought, what he felt we had to do at that time. I passed it to the teammates.</p>
      <p>“Also the captain, who through the assistants was given that instruction from the bench.</p>
      <p>“Bielsa is our leader, the coach, we support his decision and we decided to let them score a goal to tie. They are things that also define your personality, our mentality and that have a lot of repercussion. It was a moment in a game, that decision was made and we did the right thing.”</p>
      <p>The game ended 1-1 and Villa went on to achieve promotion the following month by beating Derby County at Wembley, after Leeds had lost against the Rams over two legs in the play-off semi-final.</p>
