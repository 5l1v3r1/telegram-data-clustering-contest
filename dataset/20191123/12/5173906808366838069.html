        <b>The Minister of the Environment announced on Monday that 21 quarries, out of a total of 185, are in default due to lack of perimeter fences, and have been referred to the state prosecutor.</b>
      </p>
      <p>João Pedro Matos Fernandes, speaking at the presentation session on the implementation of planned intervention work in quarries in critical situations, advanced that the government survey identified 191 quarries "in critical situation", with 150 needing signs. This work was done by the Mining Development Company (EDM) and concluded in September.</p>
      <p>"Of these 191, 185 needed fences to prevent entry into the quarries. All the owners were notified and 164 complied”.</p>
      <p>Although the 21 cases of non-compliance have been referred to the state prosecutor, EDM, will "begin putting up the fences in default between next December and April 2020”.</p>
      <p>"The work will be funded by the environmental fund and the bill sent to the owners of the quarries," added Matos Fernandes.</p>
      <p>The minister also recalled that, of the 153 quarries that needed major interventions to strengthen their structural safety, 132 were submitted by their owners.</p>
      <p>"The approval process is complex, but about 35 are already approved and the rest will be approved by the end of 2019 so that work can begin as soon as possible," said Matos Fernandes, revealing that the duration of the work ranges from six months to six years.</p>
      <p>According to Matos Fernandes, "all the signalling plans are completed," with "164 quarries of the 185 that needed fencing having been fenced off, and the rest will be completed by April by the state".</p>
      <p>"132 projects were presented for structural reinforcement of the slopes of the quarries and, in several cases, work has already begun", he reiterated.</p>
