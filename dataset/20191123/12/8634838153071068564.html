        <b>Kapseret MP Oscar Sudi on Saturday, November 23, requested the government for help after he and some of his colleagues got stuck on the way to the scene of the landslide in West Pokot County.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The legislator, who was accompanied by Sigor MP Peter Lochakapong, Marakwet East MP Kangogo Bowen and Tiaty MP William Kamket, got stranded after the bridge was swept away by the landslide.</p>
      <p>"We are appealing for humanitarian support and that of the government to at least secure us with means of transport to the scene," part of the post by the MP read.</p>

      <p>He went on to urge the national and county governments to help the affected families move from vulnerable grounds to safe zones. </p>
      <p>"Well-wishers are invited to offer clothing, food, shelter, health services among other needs," he wrote.</p>
      <p>Further, he stated that West Pokot Governor John Lonyang'apuo was also stranded in Sebit, Surkwen.</p>
      <p>"The places that are mostly affected are Nyarkulian in Tapach Ward, Penon in Batei Ward and Muino in Weiwei Ward," he added as he sent his message of condolence to the families affected. </p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 23, more than 20 people were buried alive in the West Pokot tragedy.</p>
      <p>The death and destruction reported in the two wards have been occasioned by heavy rains that have been continuously pounding the area.</p>
      <p>Apollo Okello, the area county commissioner, confirmed the incident to <i>Kenyans.co.ke </i>on Saturday, November 23, that he had also received reports of landslides in four different areas of the county.</p>
