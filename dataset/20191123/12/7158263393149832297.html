      <p>I'm probably preaching to the choir when I say, "It's hard to find cute outfits when you're pregnant!" Because your growing bump is only getting bigger and bigger as time goes by, it seems like your maternity outfit options get more and more limited. (You can only wear <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/fashion/a29776620/best-maternity-leggings/">leggings</a> for so long, people!) But there are definitely stylish pieces out there that will look so good on you—and your baby-to-be—no matter what trimester you're in. Here, we've done the work for you with these 18 cute <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a25126060/pregnancy-fashion-tips-hacks/">pregnancy</a> outfits that will make you feel comfortable and très chic. The key is not only picking things that have stretch and give to them (obviously), but also finding versatile styles that you can wear before and after you give birth. From oversize sweaters to overalls to wrap dresses, keep scrolling for some maternity inspo that's *actually* fashionable.</p>
