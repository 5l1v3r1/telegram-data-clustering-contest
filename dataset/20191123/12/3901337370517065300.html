      <p>Bales caused a bit of a stir during his celebrations with Wales after clinching qualification to the 2020 European Championship on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>Before Wednesday's encounter, Bale admitted that he is more excited playing for the national team than he does for Los Blancos.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot of noise is made with Bale's gesture and what needs to be done is to focus on football, me as a coach and he as a player. It's too much already," Zidane said, according to Marca.</p>

      <p>"The player has left with the national team, he has been able to play and we got him back. I only look at sports performance, not what is said outside. I am not interested in the outside.</p>
      <p>"I'll always say the same. When you look at what he has given this club, and its fans, the ones who come to the stadium know that he is one of our own, and the fans must be on his side.</p>
      <p>"I think he can be a decisive player. I only think about that. If something does not happen to him, he is a very important player. When something happens to him, of course, like when he is injured, it changes. I am going to count on Bale."</p>
