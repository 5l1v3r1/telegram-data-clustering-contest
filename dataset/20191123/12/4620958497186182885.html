      <p>The <a href="https://www.beasantatoasenior.com/">Be a Santa to a Senior</a> program aims to give local seniors, particularly those in long-term care homes, companionship and gifts this Christmas.</p>
      <p>“The Be a Santa to a Senior program is all about including seniors in the joy of the holiday season,” said Kim Lepp, owner of the Home Instead Senior Care office in Vancouver, which is working with London Drugs to help with gift collection and distribution.</p>
      <p>“A simple gift shows them that they are a loved and vital member of our community.”</p>
      <p>Be a Santa to a Senior trees are set up starting today (Nov. 22) at two London Drugs locations — Hastings-Sunrise (2585 East Hastings St.) and Woodwards (351 Abbott St.). Each tree is decorated with ornaments featuring a senior’s first name and a gift suggestion. Holiday shoppers can choose an ornament, buy the gift and then return it to the store with the ornament attached. There’s no need to worry about wrapping the gift — volunteers and program partners take care of wrapping and delivering the gifts to the seniors in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The trees will be up until Dec. 18.</p>
      <p>“While it may seem like a small act of kindness, it can really make a difference for someone this holiday season,” Lepp said. “Watching seniors open the gifts they received through Be a Santa to a Senior and seeing the smiles and appreciation on their faces is one of my favourite parts of the holiday season.”</p>
