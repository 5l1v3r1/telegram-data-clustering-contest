        <b>It was meant to be the fairy tale return but <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica's</a> F1 return has been anything but that as he has languished behind the rest of the field for most of the season. Despite this, Kubica is pleased with how his body has dealt with the physical challenge.</b>

      <p>Kubica returned to the pinnacle of motorsport after a rally crash in 2011 almost ended his motorsport career altogether. The return was supposed to be the dream return but it quickly turned sour, as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> and the Pole himself lacked the pace to compete with the rest of the field.</p>

      <p>He remains the scorer of the constructors' single point from the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/german-grand-prix">German Grand Prix</a>. Despite his struggles, the fact he has returned given his physical disabilities is an impressive accomplishment and something he can take from this season.</p>
      <p><i>“With my limitations, a lot of people did not even think I would be able to race,”</i> said Kubica on the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.kubica-proud-to-have-defied-critics-who-questioned-his-limitations.1pyLIdNd6R1YGcJRPHuz7r.html">Formula 1 website</a>.</p>

        <i>“I heard many stories that in Turn 1, I would not be able to react to situations – and probably the opening lap is one of the things which I managed well this season.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’m leaving this season, of course not happy with the general performance, but pretty happy with how my body, my mind and my brain reacted to the difficult challenge I had this year.”</i>
