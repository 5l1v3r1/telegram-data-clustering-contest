        <b>Five Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2014, the incoming head of the House Intelligence Committee was... Devin Nunes, talking about how <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141119/07170029191/new-house-intelligence-boss-doesnt-see-need-any-surveillance-reform.shtml">surveillance reform is unnecessary</a> — though former CIA/NSA Director Michael Hayden was saying that only ISIS would benefit from the proposed USA Freedom Act, and a defense official was telling the intelligence community to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141116/14231229167/us-defense-official-says-intelligence-agencies-need-to-grow-up-stop-blaming-snowden-their-isis-tracking-problems.shtml">grow up and stop blaming Ed Snowden</a>, <i>and</i> a former NSA executive was claiming he challenged bulk phone records collection <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141119/17363429198/former-top-nsa-exec-claims-he-challenged-bulk-phone-records-program.shtml">but was rebuffed</a>. The USA Freedom Act did fail to pass the Senate this week, but <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20141118/16555829185/usa-freedom-act-fails-to-move-forward-incredibly-stupid-reasons.shtml">for stupid reasons</a>.</p>

        <b>Ten Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2009, old-school journalists were busy <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091113/1242366920.shtml">getting mad about the internet</a>, while clinging to things like <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091117/1529536981.shtml">optimistic studies where people <i>say</i> they'd pay for online news</a>. The MPAA and Sony Pictures were backing down after <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091114/1835486934.shtml">shutting down a town's wifi</a> over a single movie download the previous week, but the MPAA was still waging war on DVRs and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091118/0740516984.shtml">being joined by the cable industry</a>, while Sony Pictures announced <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091117/2239296982.shtml">its best box office year ever</a> only a month after the CEO was moaning about piracy killing the movie business. Really, what holds back online entertainment business models was mainly <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091117/1506486977.shtml">legacy entertainment companies making it impossible for them to survive</a>. But the copyright maximalists were pleased about how things were going in the UK, with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091119/1133257010.shtml">Peter Mandelson proposing sweeping powers</a> in the much-anticipated <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20091120/1137337023.shtml">Digital Economy Bill <i>aka</i> copyright industry wish-list</a>.</p>

        <b>Fifteen Years Ago</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week in 2004, Wilco's Jeff Tweedy emerged as an early example of <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041115/090255.shtml">a musician who understood the internet</a>, and we took a bigger look at why user generated content should <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041117/1122254.shtml">change how we view copyright</a>. The MPAA officially moved ahead with its plan to follow in the RIAA's footsteps by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041116/1518215.shtml">suing a bunch of John Doe file-sharers</a>, and Hollywood was just getting started on the anti-DVR war that would continue for years by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041116/0818209.shtml">trying to have commercial skipping deemed illegal</a> (and of all people, it was John McCain who recognized <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041119/0054218.shtml">just how ridiculous this was</a>). Meanwhile, Steve Ballmer made some FUD waves with his claim that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041118/0930249.shtml">anyone who uses Linux will be sued for patent infringement</a> — which was quickly rebuffed by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20041119/1621217.shtml">the author of the study he said the idea was based on</a>.</p>
