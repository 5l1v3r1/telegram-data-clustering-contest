      <h3>Training, education and research adds value</h3>
      <p>It was very pleasing to read the article, Provincial businesses chase leads In Europe, in the Nov. 15 Leader-Post.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the provincial government’s new growth plan, it is important to realize that Saskatchewan’s economy is export-driven and trade-dependent. The Saskatchewan advantage in this regard is the value-added component our post-secondary educational system has to offer, with outstanding training and education programs as well as innovative research.</p>
      <p>Tina Beaudry-Mellor, Minister of Advanced Education and Minister responsible for Innovation, understands the importance of this as well as recognizing the need for greater acceptance of educational-training credentials. Trade missions and presence at international trade shows led by STEP (Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership) have proven cost benefits.</p>
      <p>When human resource development becomes part of the deal, everyone wins.</p>

      <h3>Don’t separate, just leave</h3>
      <p>I take exception to all this talk about western alienation and the threat of Saskatchewan and Alberta leaving Canada.</p>
      <p>I am a loyal Canadian who has lived all but four years of my life in British Columbia (born and raised), Alberta and Saskatchewan. I have no intention of leaving Canada and do not believe anyone has the right to force me to leave Canada.</p>
      <p>The answer to this matter is quite simple: Those who are unhappy and feel they do not want to remain in Canada should simply leave.</p>

      <h3>Maintenance not an item?</h3>
      <p>Who could possibly be surprised when any government building needs huge dollars for repairs.</p>
      <p>I would bet “maintenance” is not an item in any annual budget.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>We are all stronger together</h3>
      <p>I appreciated Rob Vanstone’s article, “<a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-show-that-nice-guys-can-finish-first">Roughriders able to show that nice guys can finish first</a>” (LP, Nov. 6). I liked it as a longtime Roughrider fan but more importantly because it illustrates how we are all stronger when we have a common goal and work together.</p>
      <p>I hold this example up as a strong contrast to what is happening to us as a Canadian society. I am deeply troubled that there are some among us who appear to be willing to “cut off their noses to spite their faces.” The “Wexit movement” seems to be willing to suffer irreparable losses in a foolhardy attempt to bring suffering to fellow Canadians because they feel left out or unappreciated.</p>
      <p>This whole situation is far too complex for me to try and support my position with a rudimentary analysis by an 82-year-old citizen. Instead, just think about what would happen if members of the Roughriders were arguing among themselves about why someone gets more money than they do. Or why some get more publicity? If one or more players decided they wouldn’t give their best effort unless and until they got more money, better bonuses or whatever.</p>
      <p>Our situation is serious, the problems are real and complex and rooted in a historical context. Nevertheless, we are stronger together. Just ask the Riders.</p>
