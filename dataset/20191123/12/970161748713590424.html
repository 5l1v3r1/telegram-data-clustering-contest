      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>’ Josh Brolin has shared a sweet snap with his wife Kathryn after leaving a slightly awkward comment on his co-star Zoe Saldana’s picture.</p>
      <p>He’s shrugging off the judgement from fans.</p>
      <p>The Thanos star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/avengers-star-josh-brolin-celebrates-six-years-sobriety-inner-power-11191435/">who recently celebrated six years of sobriety</a>, snapped a photo of his wife biting his mouth, as he held up her hair.</p>
      <p>‘For reals. @kathrynbrolin,’ the actor wrote.</p>
      <p>Fans and friends are loving the cute photo, with one writing: ‘That’s forever. Eternal,’ and another telling him: ‘Beautiful.’</p>

      <p>Josh and his model beau tied the knot back in 2016, with the pair sharing their son Westlyn.</p>
      <p>The photo comes after Josh left a slightly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/avengers-josh-brolin-thirsts-marvel-daughter-zoe-saldana-awkward-11201327/">awkward comment on his on-screen daughter Zoe Saldana’s Instagram.</a></p>
      <p>Zoe, who plays Gamora in the MCU, had us all in awe as she posted a stunning topless photo, writing in the caption: ‘Pre-everything….’</p>

      <p>However, Josh, who stars as the Mad Titan, came in with the awkwardness as he commented: ‘Dang @zoesaldana.’ Fans weren’t about to let the comment pass them by, with one writing: ‘That’s your daughter bro lol.’</p>
      <p>‘Stay away Thanos!’ another urged, with one more quipping: ‘Smells like alabama in here.’</p>
      <p>However, other fans made sure to point out that Thanos and Gamora aren’t actually related by blood since he’s her adoptive father.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, bits of trivia are still being released about the final movie of the Infinity Saga, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/avengers-endgame-cut-huge-battle-sequence-thanos-army-11203573/">with it now being revealed that a battle involving Thanos’ army was cut.</a></p>
      <p>In the new artbook for the movie, concept illustrator Josh Nizzi spoke about the prospect of squeezing in another fight. Alongside a string of drawings, he explained how it was hoped the purple one would be seen going up against a military alien race, <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/11/22/avengers-endgame-thanos-army-cut-a-huge-battle-with/">reports Comicbook.com.</a></p>
      <p>He said: ‘Marvel wanted to show how powerful Thanos was even before he had any of the Stones.</p>
      <p>‘There was going to be a huge battle sequence where he fights a military alien race. The aliens actually did show up in the film but only for a few seconds before being killed by Gamora and Nebula.’</p>

      <p>Not the epic battle scene that was planned, but we’ll take it.</p>
