      <p>The England management were ‘unhappy’ with Jofra Archer and ‘rebuked’ the fast bowler after he jumped on a segway on the outfield before the start of the first Test against New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Archer was seen using a broadcaster’s segway as the teams prepared for the opening day’s play in Tauranga on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>England fans have become accustomed to the Ashes and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/world-cup/">World Cup</a> star’s somewhat casual warm-ups, with Archer often bowling left-arm spin moments before the start of matches.</p>

      <p>But the England management reacted badly to his segway routine, with Sportsmail reporting that Archer was rebuked during the opening New Zealand Test.</p>
      <p>It is claimed England were ‘unhappy’ that Archer risked injury just moments before the start of the series, particularly as ECB chief Tom Harrison was in attendance.</p>

      <p>Archer is yet to take a wicket in the match, with New Zealand reaching 394-6 at the close of day three in reply to England’s 353 all out.</p>
      <p>New Zealand stuttered to 127-4 on day two but BJ Watling’s unbeaten 119 has put the hosts in a strong position going into day four.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the end of day three, Kiwi batsman Henry Nicholls said: ‘It is a great day. If you look where we were at the start, with a lot of work to be put in, we knew we were good enough to put ourselves in a position to control game.</p>
      <p>‘The role BJ [Watling] played was a real pleasure to watch throughout the day.</p>
      <p>‘He is great. He is such a hard-worker. He is a guy you know what you will get. He kept for 110 overs and to come out last night, and today, it is great to have someone like that in the team.’</p>
