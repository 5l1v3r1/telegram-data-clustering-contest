        <b>Cardi B is not standing for any of Santa’s nonsense in the new Pepsi Christmas advert, as she takes on his job.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardi Klaus has a good ring to it.</p>
      <p>With a narrator voicing the first part of the ad, he declares that Cardi was placed on the naughty list, with the rapper arguing: ‘That’s a silly rule, what’s wrong with naughty? Being naughty and nice is what makes me Cardi.’</p>
      <p>Pledging that one day she’ll take over Santa’s job and gift everyone with money, we’re blessed with a shot of Cardi talking to her manager on the phone while clutching a jewel encrusted Pepsi can.</p>

      <p>‘What do you mean? You know what I like. Give me some of that Pepsi money, I need it!’ she says, before showing off her own workshop – or ‘Twerk Shop’ – with elves producing mountain loads of cash.</p>

      <p>You know, just your standard Christmas story.</p>
      <p>With a catchy jingle promising that Cardi’s going to ‘make it rain’, she’s shown teaching an elf to dance before turning down helping out in the ‘Wrap Studio’ and flying off in her magic car.</p>
      <p>All in all, it’s a wild ride.</p>
      <p>Fans are here for the star’s role in the advert, with one writing: ‘Yo this ad was so f***ng entertaining.’</p>

      <p>‘Better than Frozen,’ another quipped, with one more saying: ‘These keep getting better! Love the Cardi jingle.’</p>
      <p>We’re being slightly overwhelmed with Christmas ads as the festive season nears, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/john-lewis-christmas-2019-edgar-dragon-11088313/">with John Lewis releasing their eagerly-anticipated video.</a></p>
      <p>Edgar the dragon melted our hearts as he caused chaos in a small village by getting over-excited about Christmas. Highly relatable.</p>
      <p>And Sainsbury’s even included an Easter egg in their advert, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/infamous-plug-boy-makes-appearance-in-sainsburys-2019-christmas-advert-and-no-one-even-notices-11124247/">throwing it back to Plug Boy who stole everyone’s hearts by throwing himself at the wall last year</a>.</p>
      <p>Ah, we can feel the Christmas spirit already.</p>
