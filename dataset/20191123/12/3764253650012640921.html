      <p>To say that the video is well shot and amazingly produced is an understatement. It showcases various street cultures incorporated with great, simple, but fantastic dance moves. If you love to dance, then this video is for you. The energy, good footwork and the choreography, plus some freestyle moves, especially where some children are featured, takes it to a whole new level. The shirtless staring boys (men) and the face-painted children are a plus and bring to light the producer’s artistic work.</p>
