      <h1>Report: Aston Villa boss Dean Smith keen on Norwich attacker Emiliano Buendia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:15:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/dom-toner/" target="_blank">Dom Toner</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa are reportedly eyeing Norwich City attacker Emiliano Buendia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12040/11867415/aston-villa-retain-interest-in-brentfords-said-benrahma-ahead-of-january-transfer-window">According to Sky Sports</a>, Villa manager Dean Smith is “keen” on the South American star.</p>
      <p>It is understood that he could cost over £20million to prize away from Carrow Road, as he’s one of the influential figures in the Norwich team.</p>
      <p>The report also details that Brentford wide man Said Benrahma is also wanted by Villa ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Buendia was in excellent form last season for Norwich, with eight goals and 17 assists in 41 games across all competitions.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Argentine has four Premier League assists so far this season following his team’s promotion to the top-flight, but is part of a struggling side right now.</p>
      <p>He is a skilful right-winger that has excellent vision to pick a pass and is intelligent in the final third.</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Buendia is a special young player that has shown in glimpses so far this season and there is certainly plenty more to come from him.</p>
      <p>The diminutive playmaker is the one that can help pull the strings for Norwich when he’s on form and it’s easy to imagine him moving on to bigger things.</p>
      <p>Villa fans should be pleased by interest in the Norwich creator due to his potential, but it seems unlikely they can nick him off a rival midway through a season and he would be expensive.</p>
