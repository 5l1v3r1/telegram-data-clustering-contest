      <h2>With kids often more techy than their parents, where do you even begin looking for a gift that will appeal to their geeky side? Our ultimate guide to kids' tech gifts features more than 100 products that will suit youngsters of all ages.</h2>

      <p>Christmas is all about the kids. Nothing beats the smile on their faces (and your own) when you know you've given them a gift they really love.</p>
      <p>But shopping for kids' Christmas presents has become incredibly difficult - not because you're short of options, but because there's almost too much choice. And when it comes to choosing tech for a child who probably knows more about it than you do, you can feel out of your depth.</p>
      <p>We've put together our ultimate tech gift list for kids, which contains more than 100 tech products any child would be happy to receive. We've considered all ages, from youngsters right through to teenagers, and focused strongly on value for money - Christmas is an expensive time, especially when it might seem that quantity of gifts can outweigh quality.</p>
      <p>We've got everything from big-ticket gifts like phones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches and games consoles to smaller tech accessories that would make great stocking fillers or less expensive presents from their favourite aunt or uncle. For sure, there's something here that every kid will love.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The prices listed below for each product in this feature are updated automatically, and include the latest early Black Friday deals and sales.</b>

      <anchor name="toc-3776438-1">
        <h4>Amazon Fire 7 (2019)</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3776438/amazon-fire-7-2019-review_thumb800.jpg"/>

        <ul>
          <li><b>RRP: </b>£49.99 (16GB); £59.99 (32GB)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every kid wants a tablet, and no tablet offers better value than the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-7-Tablet---Black---16-GB/dp/B07JQRYR5M/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Amazon Fire 7</a> (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/tablet-pcs/amazon-fire-7-2019-3697882/">reviewed</a>). A Black Friday discount brings the price down to a tiny £29.</p>
        <p>It has a 7in IPS display with a reasonably low resolution of 1024x600 pixels, but it's a great size for small hands and the 1.3GHz quad-core processor inside is more than sufficient for playing casual children's games.</p>
        <p>It's reasonably easy to lock down the Fire 7 using parental controls, but if this is a particular concern we also recommend the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fire-7-Kids-Edition---Black-Blue---16-GB/dp/B07H8XTGFN/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Kids Edition</a> (currently reduced from £99 to £54.99). It comes with a tough bumper case and a two-year warranty that covers accidental damage, plus access to games, videos, music and more at Kids Unlimited.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the one drawback of Amazon tablets is they do not support Google services, which means you don't get access to the Google Play store and therefore your kids might not be able to access all the same games as their friends. There is a workaround that lets you <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/tablets/install-app-kindle-fire-3700641/">add any Android app to a Fire tablet</a>, but it's going to need adult intervention.</p>
        <p>If you are looking for a full Android tablet, you won't find a better balance of specifications and value than in the £269 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Huawei-Mediapad-Tablet-Grey-Octa-Core/dp/B07BDT3WVY/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">MediaPad M5 8</a> from Huawei. The £166.71 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Huawei-Mediapad-Tablet-Grey-Octa-Core/dp/B075KHSRT3/?th=1&amp;ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">MediaPad M3 Lite</a> is a slightly cheaper option, still with an 8in screen.</p>
        <p>You'll find more tablets primed for children in our round-up of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/tablets/best-kids-tablets-3378548/">best kids' tablets</a>.</p>

            <li><b>RRP: </b>£239</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It wouldn't surprise us if top of your kids' Christmas list was a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776438-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-tech-gifts-kids-3776438%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Ffeature%2Fiphone%2Fbest-iphone-3664418%2F">new iPhone</a>, but few parents are going to have the budget for that without looking down to an older model. If you have made the decision that your child is old enough to be responsible for a smartphone, the most appropriate option you'll find is the Moto G7 (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/moto-g7-3691804/">reviewed</a>), which right now is reduced to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/motorola-6-24-Inch-Android-Sim-Free-Smartphone-Black/dp/B07N8KXQLH/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">£179.99 SIM-free</a>.</p>
          <p>We'd recommend pairing it with a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776438-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-tech-gifts-kids-3776438%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.giffgaff.com%2Fsim-only-plans">GiffGaff Goodybag</a>, which offer a kind of mash-up between PAYG and contract, stopping them going over a certain pre-paid limit but also ensuring they are always able to make calls and texts should an emergency arise. Plans start at £6 a month and offer great value.</p>
          <p>Going back to the phone, the Moto G7 has an outstanding 6.2in full-HD display, a useful amount of internal storage at 64GB, and capable performance from the Snapdragon 632 octa-core chip inside. The cameras are great, too, with a dual-lens (12Mp + 5Mp) setup at the rear and 5Mp at the front, and there's even a fingerprint sensor. The software is vanilla Android, and therefore straightforward in use. It's everything they need.</p>
          <p>If you are buying your kid their first phone, be sure to set up some ground rules - take it from me, Auntie Rie does not want 50 missed calls at 5am. We've got a great guide on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/how-to/google-android/android-parental-controls-3461359/">setting up parental control software</a> that can help.</p>

            <h4>Personalised PopSocket</h4>

            <ul>
              <li><b>RRP: </b>£16.99</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You've probably seen PopSockets before, but you might not know what they're called. Attaching to the back of a smartphone or tablet they lie flat but when needed can pop up and act as a stand or simply offer extra grip. If you're worried about your child smashing their expensive new device as it tumbles from their tiny hands, they're seriously worth a look.</p>
            <p>There are tons of PopSocket designs out there, and it's now possible to swap out the 'PopTops' rather than having to replace the entire thing every time you want to mix it up. </p>
            <p>As a gift we love this personalised Custom PopGrip, which costs £16.99 direct from <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776438-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-tech-gifts-kids-3776438%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpopsockets.co.uk%2Fproducts%2Fcustom-popgrip">PopSockets</a>. It comes in a range of colours, and you can apply your own photo to complete the design. And you just know your teenager would love to carry around a photo of their dear old mum on the back of their phone wherever they go. You can have some real fun with this one.</p>
            <p>We've rounded up some more <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/mobile-phone/best-popsockets-phone-grip-3697791/">PopSocket designs we love</a>.</p>

              <h4>Zendure Power Bank</h4>
              <figure>

              <ul>
                <li><b>RRP: </b>£43.99</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Phones, tablets and handheld gaming consoles keep the kids quiet only so long as their batteries hold out. A power bank can extend the peace until you feel they've had enough screen time.</p>
              <p>We love Zendure's range of power banks for their cool-looking and virtually indestructible design, and their careful balance of portability, power and performance. There is some great tech inside these batteries, with each bank in the range able to support passthrough charging, a much higher than industry-standard efficiency rating of 80 percent, and the promise of long-term standby up to six months.</p>
              <p>This <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Zendure-Ultra-Slim-10000mah-Portable-More-Silver-Silver/dp/B07FSNNXHC/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">ultra-slim model</a> is one of the newer models in the range with support for 18W Quick Charge 3.0 and Power Delivery. That's important because, unlike many other power banks of this capacity, it can power not only a phone or tablet but also more power-hungry gadgets such as a Nintendo Switch.</p>
              <p>From the 10,000mAh battery you can reasonably expect to charge most phones between two and three times.</p>
              <p>We've rounded up some of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/gadget/best-power-bank-3682180/">best power banks</a> out there, but if value for money is your primary concern also check out these <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/gadget/power-bank-deals-3687243/">power bank deals</a>.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>These days more and more phones, smartwatches and wireless earbuds support wireless charging, and being able to simply throw down a gadget on a pad for it to charge is so much more convenient than having to find and then fiddle around with cables.</p>
                <p>The down side of wireless charging is it can be slow, but this <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dodocool-Wireless-Charger-Inductive-Samsung/dp/B078SRB2V2/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Dodocool wireless charger</a> (currently reduced to £11.99) is one of the faster models out there with a 10W output. It's also really affordable, making this an ideal stocking filler for a child who has some compatible Qi wireless charging tech.</p>
                <p>If they would rather keep using their device while charging, upright stand versions are also available such as this £12.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07P7FKXJJ?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">ESR</a> model.

                  <p>Every year we run into the same question from parents looking to buy the ultimate Christmas gift for their child: a laptop. But not just any laptop, a gaming laptop that costs less than £300.</p>
                  <p>Since it's Black Friday week, there are a bunch of decent laptops available under £300, and you'll find some of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/laptop/budget-laptop-deals-3778465/">best cheap laptop deals</a> here.</p>
                  <p>There are even some options below £200, such as the £179 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-tech-gifts-kids-3776438%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.awin1.com%2Fcread.php%3Fawinmid%3D1599%26awinaffid%3D254429%26clickref%3D06-3776438-11-0000000%26p%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.currys.co.uk%252Fgbuk%252Fcomputing%252Flaptops%252Flaptops%252Fhp-stream-11-ak0500sa-11-6-intel-celeron-laptop-32-gb-emmc-pink-10189380-pdt.html">HP Stream 11</a>, while <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/laptop/best-chromebooks-2019-3528995/">Chromebooks</a> and CloudBooks present particularly good value if you're not fussed over getting a Windows or macOS operating system.</p>
                  <p>But while integrated graphics chips are getting more powerful all the time, to play the most intensive games your child is really going to want a dedicated graphics card and a powerful processor, and that you are not going to find at £300. You might actually find better value from a budget gaming desktop PC.</p>
                  <p>One of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/laptop/best-budget-laptop-3214583/">best budget laptops</a> you'll find is the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07Q444SNQ?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">HP 250 G7</a>. It has a 15.6in screen, an Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, but it's £400 and though it should cope with some gaming, including Fortnite, it's still going to be no match for a proper gaming laptop.</p>

                    <p>It's a smart TV offering access to mainstream apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and YouTube, as well as Freeview HD and Freeview Play. There's even a built-in DVD drive for playing your children's favourite movies, plus two HDMI ports for consoles and other devices.</p>
                    <p>Expect reasonable audio with support for DTS TruSurround and DTS HD.</p>

                      <p>The best budget media streamer you can buy, Roku Express is cheaper than the Fire TV Stick and more user-friendly than Chromecast. Offering access to all the main free and paid catch-up and on-demand streaming services, it's an ideal gift for an older child who is picky about what they watch.</p>
                      <p>A free mobile app adds voice- and remote control, but the diminutive Roku Express will sit unobtrusively below a TV where it will happily operate with the bundled infra-red remote control. Small and light, it's difficult to believe such a tiny box can make such a huge difference to your entertainment experience.</p>
                      <p>You can pick up the new Roku Express for just £24.99 from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Roku-Express-Streaming-Media-Player/dp/B07XGMNK9G?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Amazon</a> (usual retail price £29.99).</p>

                          <p>We predict wireless earbuds are going to be one of the most gifted consumer tech products this year - popularised by the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MV7N2ZM/A/airpods-with-charging-case">Apple AirPods</a>, but not everyone has an iPhone or wants to pay out £159 for a gift that could quite easily get lost. These <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07TQ3Y7ZV?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Creative Outlier Air</a> buds are half the price, and you will not find a better-sounding pair of true wireless earbuds at this price, especially if you like bass.</p>
                          <p>The buds have an offset design: their tips fit into your ear canal, and you rotate the body slightly backward until it fits snugly into position in your outer ear. The shallow silicone tips are designed to fit all ears, and surprisingly they do seem to.</p>
                          <p>Each bud has a button and an LED ring which tells you its status. A single, short press plays or pauses the current song or video, and a double-press goes to the next or previous track, depending upon which bud you press (right is forward, left is back). You can also control volume, and each bud has its own mic, with both used for phone calls.</p>
                          <p>Fully charged the buds last 10 hours, and the charging case adds two full charges taking that figure up to 30 hours.</p>

                            <p>The JuniorJams we list above are kids' headphones that look and feel good, but they might be priced a little higher than you'd like, or perhaps your child would prefer something linked to their favourite toy brand or superhero.</p>
                            <p>Argos stocks a range of children's wired on-ear headphones from £14.99. Each features cushioned earpieces and 40mm drivers, connecting to a phone or tablet using a standard 3.5mm audio jack.</p>

                              <p>Even with the comfiest ear cushioning and the most ergonomic and easily adjustable headbands, some kids just won't get on with proper headphones, while earbuds are likely to fall out.</p>
                              <p>We love these cute audio headbands from Argos, which cost just £14.99. They are lightweight at 50g, and feature a soft fleece band for the ultimate in comfort. A Velcro strip lets you size them perfectly for your child's head, and they can accommodate from 38cm-58cm.</p>
                              <p>These are wired headphones, so will still need to be connected to your child's tablet or phone via a 3.5mm audio jack. A 1.4m cord is supplied.</p>

                                <p>You don't need us to tell you kids love music, and sometimes it's okay to let them blast it out for the whole house to hear rather than slapping on a pair of headphones. Bluetooth speakers used to go down a treat, allowing them to stream YouTube or Spotify music from their phones and tablets, but these days it's becoming increasingly difficult to recommend budget models when we are faced with some excellent-value smart speakers.</p>
                                <p>With built-in voice assistants you can use your voice to demand that they tell you the latest news, check the weather, control your smart home kit and more. One of their most important abilities is streaming music, and they can do that over age-old Bluetooth or by utilising their web connection to stream online radio and all your favourite tunes from various subscription (paid and free) services.</p>
                                <p>New for the 2019 holiday season is the currently reduced to £34.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation-smart-speaker-with-clock-alexa/dp/B07NQG1V13/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Echo Dot with Clock</a> (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/amazon-echo-dot-with-clock-3776046/">reviewed</a>), which is in essence an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Charcoal/dp/B07PJV3JPR/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Echo Dot 3</a> (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/amazon-echo-dot-3-3685148/">reviewed</a>) with a display that can show the time, the outside temperature, and a countdown timer. If you're looking for something to stick in their bedroom, this is going to double up as a bedside alarm clock. It offers surprisingly good audio, too.</p>
                                <p>Echo Dot with Clock usually comes at a £10 premium over the standard Echo Dot, but the cheaper model has gone down to £22 for Black Friday.

                                  <p>This latest version has a few design tweaks including a new wall mount, and it is more responsive and able to play louder, clearer audio than ever before. In many ways it's pretty much the same thing as the Echo Dot, but there is one important difference: rather than Alexa it uses the Google Assistant voice assistant.</p>
                                  <p>Realistically, which model you choose is going to depend on what other devices you already own, particularly when it comes to smart home kit, and whether you are a Google household or an Amazon household. But in our humble opinion the Google Assistant wins this battle, largely because it is able to converse in natural language. It has a few other tricks up its sleeve, too, such as the ability to call anyone in your Google Contacts for free.</p>
                                  <p>Google Nest Mini usually costs £49, but has been reduced to £29 for Black Friday.

                                    <p>Apple is still one of the coolest tech companies in the world in the eyes of most teenagers. If they have an iPhone, an Apple Watch would make like the best present ever. Except, as with all Apple stuff, the new <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch">Watch Series 5</a> is kind of expensive, starting at £399/$399.</p>
                                    <p>What you might not be aware of is that when Apple announced the new Apple Watch in September 2019, it kept on sale the older <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-series-3">Apple Watch Series 3</a> (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3776438-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgadget%2Fbest-tech-gifts-kids-3776438%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.co.uk%2Freview%2Fapple-watch%2Fapple-watch-series-3-review-3663715%2F">reviewed</a>) at a discounted price of £199/$199. (That's for the 38mm version; the 42mm version starts at £229/$229.)</p>
                                    <p>By buying the older model you miss out on some of the more recent developments in the line - the faster processor, a 30% larger always-on display, a more sophisticated heart-rate sensor and fall detection, a compass and some extra internal storage. But the Series 3 remains a great smartwatch, and a gift your child will love.</p>
                                    <p>If they don't have an iPhone, of course, a Wear OS (or other) smartwatch might be more practical.

                                      <p>But enough about what it does for you - your child will love the built-in games and voice-messaging capabilities, and the feeling that they are wearing a proper smartwatch like the grown-ups.</p>
                                      <p>The V-Watch, available in blue or pink, is IP67 waterproof, lightweight (50g) and has a three-day battery life.</p>

                                        <p>Currently retailing at a Black Friday price of £59.49, the Ace 2 (<a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/activity-trackers/fitbit-ace-2-review-3699026/">reviewed</a>) is a waterproof fitness tracker aimed at kids aged 6 and above. With accounts previously accessible only by those aged 13 and above, with Ace 2 Fitbit has opened up a whole new world of activity tracking for children, who are most likely going to want to use it because it feels like a grown-up thing to do.</p>
                                        <p>For its younger audience Fitbit has made some tweaks, stripping out the calorie counting and adding in different modes for kids and parents. Through the Kid View, kids can see only their stats data, badges and clock face options, plus are able to connect with parent-approved friends.</p>

                                          <p>Though Fitbit is by far the best-known maker of activity bands, we can't help having our heads turned by Garmin's second-gen <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garmin-vivofit-Jr-Princess-Adjustable/dp/B07GQ5JD96?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Vivofit Junior trackers</a>, which come in a range of designs that kids will love.</p>
                                          <p>It's a little bit more expensive than the Ace 2 at £79.99, but with £20 off for Black Friday there are only pennies in it. Garmin's range caters to fans of Disney Princess, Frozen, Marvel's Avengers, Star Wars and even Minnie Mouse.</p>
                                          <p>For kids the lack of a rechargeable battery is actually a good thing, and these swim-proof bands are said to last up to a year before the battery needs replacing.</p>
                                          <p>The Vivofit Jnr 2 tracks steps, sleep and daily activity, motivating kids by offering to unlock app adventures and games. Parents can also access chore management and reward tools.</p>

                                                        <p>Digital cameras used to be a go-to gift for kids, but these days they all use their phones. That is unless they are too young to own a phone. </p>
                                                        <p>The MyFirst Camera from Oaxis is perfect for kids aged 4 and above. It's quite a bit smaller than other kids' cameras, which means it will fit easily into a pocket, and yet the buttons remain easy to press. The menu is simple to navigate, and to take a photo all they need do is turn it on, point and shoot.</p>
                                                        <p>We love the Lego-effect blocky design, and especially appreciate the included waterproof housing - even if they aren't getting it wet the chances are it will get covered in whatever else their sticky little fingers get hold of.</p>
                                                        <p>Also in the box is a lanyard and an SD card reader for getting the photos off the digital camera and on to a laptop where you can treasure forever pictures of your knee, the floor, and 10 million selfies zoomed right into their eye. There are some stickers too, because kids love stickers.</p>
                                                        <p>The camera itself is fairly basic, with a 2in LCD screen and an 1,100mAh battery. The lens is 8Mp, supporting stills at 3264x2448 pixels and full-HD video at 30fps. </p>
                                                        <p>Currently difficult to find in the UK, <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/06-3776438-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/1972766">Argos</a> stocks the MyFirst Camera at the inflated price of £60. Interestingly, though, we've also found it on Amazon branded as the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kriogor-Digital-Camera-Children-Birthday/dp/B07KG3BT3H/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Kriogor Kids Digital Camera</a>, listed at £29.99 with a range of colour options and good availability.</p>

                                                          <p>GoPro is easily the best known <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/photo-video/best-gopro-3640249/">action camera</a> maker, but many of its products might be a little too expensive for your budget (the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07GT7Q2Q2?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Hero 7</a> is one of the cheaper options, now down to £129.99). And depending on your child's age they could also be overly complicated to use.</p>
                                                          <p>For younger kids we like the Kidizoom Action Cam from VTech. It's perfect for little adventurers aged 5 and above.</p>
                                                          <p>In the box you'll find various accessories, such as a waterproof case and various mounts, but you will need to supply your own microSD card for storage.</p>
                                                          <p>Able to capture high-definition photos and video, kids can add a range of visual effects, enjoy three included games, and mess about with various shooting modes: stop motion, slow motion, fast motion and reverse video.</p>

The kids want to get in on that action too, and for us adults anything that is going to help convince them to actually brush their teeth is a win-win.</p>
                                                            <p>We love this fun Deeno-Saur toothbrush for kids aged 3 and above, and it's a bargain at just £11.50 from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deeno-DEENO-Saur-Electric-Toothbrush-Batteries/dp/B07W8T2G5L?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Amazon</a>.

It uses sonic brushing technology and an intuitive bristle pattern to get into all the hard-to-reach areas, and there's a tongue cleaner on the rear.</p>
                                                            <p>A timer makes sure they keep brushing for two minutes, and when connected to a companion app (iOS and Android) they will earn Deeno coins as a reward. In the box you'll find two heads, some stickers for customising Deeno, a tiny egg that hatches into a dinosaur, and three AAA batteries.</p>
                                                            <p>But Deeno-Saur is just one of many electric toothbrushes aimed at kids, and with the upcoming release of Frozen 2 we think this <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/06-3776438-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4618917">£17.49 Elsa toothbrush</a> from Oral-B will also go down well.</p>

                                                            <p>We like the Turtle Beach Recon 70P. It's PlayStation colours, but it's a wired headset (with a 1m cable) so will work on all platforms. It has an adjustable headband, and swivelling ear cups to help find a comfortable fit.</p>
                                                            <p>Turtle Beach has placed a flip-mic and volume controls on one of the earcups rather than using an in-line control, making it easy to adjust volume and mute your mic in the heat of battle.</p>
                                                            <p>Like other budget headsets on the market, the Recon 70 sports 40mm drivers opposed to larger 50mm drivers favoured by premium headsets, but despite the size reduction, the quality of the headphones is still great, providing booming bass during Earth-shattering explosions and crisp vocals during those heart-wrenching emotional gaming moments.</p>
                                                            <p>Essentially, the Recon 70 is a no-thrills headset that’ll get the job done, with surprising sound clarity for a headset for this price.

                                                            <p>Okay so it's definitely true that it's possible to spend a ton of cash on keyboards aimed at gamers, and there is a lot to be said for some of the more premium models and how much they can enhance your gameplay. But, at a certain age, it's also true that all a child wants is for their keyboard to light up in funky colours. You're welcome.</p>
                                                            <p>This Trust GTX 830-RW might seem like a substantial present, especially wrapped up under the tree, but in fact it's available at a tiny £22.97 at <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trust-830-RW-Gaming-Keyboard-Illuminated/dp/B0774T9Y4J/?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">Amazon</a>.</p>
                                                            <p>It's a full-size model, and supports rainbow wave illumination with adjustable brightness. For gamers there's anti-ghosting, and you can disable the Windows button to stop accidental presses meaning the Start menu will pop up at exactly the wrong time.</p>
                                                            <p>It's a wired keyboard, so setup couldn't be easier: you just plug and play, with no worries about what happens when the batteries run out.</p>
                                                            <p>For some more premium options see our guide to the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/game/best-gaming-keyboards-3642672/">best gaming keyboards</a>.</p>

                                                            <p>Fortunately, everything we just said about keyboards above also applies to mice, and we've seen 10-year-olds seriously lose their, ah, bananas, over this £12.99 mouse (<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/VersionTECH-Computer-Ergonomic-Backlight-Settings/dp/B07BT4LZXG?ascsubtag=06-3776438-11-0000000">currently reduced to £7.99</a>) from VersionTech. Why? Because it lights up in seven different colours. Seriously.</p>
                                                            <p>It's a pretty basic optical mouse in other respects, although almost certainly a little less basic than the generic mouse that was sold with their desktop, and an improvement over many laptop trackpads.</p>
                                                            <p>There's an ergonomic design with a rubber scroll wheel, and it's wired so you simply plug it into a USB port and you're away. A dpi button on top lets you switch between 800, 1200, 1600 and 2400dpi resolution, and there are two side buttons. Simple, but they'll love it.</p>

                                                            <p>Kids always seem so desperate to grow up, and one of the things they can't have until they get older is a debit- or credit card. <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/software/what-is-gohenry-3651428/">GoHenry </a>is an alternative option for children aged 6-18, a prepaid credit card that lets them stick it on the plastic rather than carrying (and quite possibly losing) cash.</p>
                                                            <p>It's more than just a card for kids, however. GoHenry is the digital equivalent of pocket money, allowing you to award bonuses for chores and impose weekly spending limits, without fear of them spending whatever money you don't have.</p>
                                                            <p>GoHenry can help kids learn about money before they are old enough to get themselves into debt, and through the companion app you can control where and how much they are spending.</p>
                                                            <p>Cards are personalised, too, so rather than GoHenry your kid can get their own GoAlex or GoLucy card, for example.</p>
                                                            <p>It's not free, with a £2.99 monthly charge that allows you to make one payment on to the card per month. Additional payments carry a 50p sub-charge.</p>
