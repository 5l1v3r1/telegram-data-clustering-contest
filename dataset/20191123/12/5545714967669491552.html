      <h1>Hugely-successful Pokemon Center will return to London in 2020</h1>
      <h2>Strike a light guv'nor with the apples and pears...</h2>

      <p>The doors have closed on London's "pop-up" <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../pop-up-pokemon-centre-coming-to-london-this-october-562918.phtml">Pokémon Centre</a> which has, for the last month, offered Pokémon fans the opportunity to pick up a wide range of fun and exclusive merchandise based on the uber-popular trading card, anime and video game franchise.<br/><br/>As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-londons-pop-up-pokemon-center-shop-to-return-in-2020">Eurogamer</a>, The Pokémon Company has already announced that the store will once again return on a temporary basis in summer of next year, housed alongside the 2020 Pokémon World Championships. Although a specific venue for either event has not been announced, the championships will take place in London.</p>

      <p>It would be foolish for the Pokémon Centre not to return, as it has seen staggering success over the past month. Some 30,000 fans visited the retailer, with daily queues of up to six hours, and frequent concerns that their would not be enough stock to cover the operating period. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../pokemon-centre-london-continues-to-see-gigantamax-queues-sets-earlier-closing-times-570510.phtml">Limitations had to be placed on certain items, opening times, and total purchases,</a> as cash-stacked fans filled up on hats, t-shirts, little city gent Pikachus and even the occasional giant plush doll.<br/><br/>And if you missed out this time around, at least you have plenty of time to save up for next year's chaos.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-22-londons-pop-up-pokemon-center-shop-to-return-in-2020">London's pop-up Pokémon Center to return in 2020</a> [Eurogamer]</p>
