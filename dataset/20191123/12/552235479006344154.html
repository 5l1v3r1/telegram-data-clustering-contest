      <h2>The Celtic-daft rocker has explained that not everyone in his family shares his Hoops adoration.</h2>

      <p>Legendary rock star Sir Rod Stewart is well known for his love of all things <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> but he's admitted it's a passion that doesn't run in his family.</p>
      <p>While the Maggie May singer is a regular at Celtic Park, his brother Robert is a lifelong <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> fanatic.</p>
      <p>His father, a builder from Leith, was Hibs supporter but Stewart has revealed he has an engraving of Rangers legend Eric Caldow on his gravestone - something he reckons his brother might be responsible for.</p>
      <p>Legendary full-back Caldow signed for Rangers in 1953 and spent 13 years at the club becoming one of it's most storied players, amassing 40 caps for Scotland along the way.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/">Herald</a> , Stewart said: "I feel at home there and loved by one half of the city perhaps. I sometimes wonder if Rangers supporters stay away but like my music .</p>
      <p>"My oldest brother is a Rangers fan and has been all his life. WeÂ  don't have fights about it. There is a Rangers player engraved on my Dad's grave, Eric Caldow, Robert must have wangled that!</p>
      <p>"My Dad came from Leith and I have a few friends there. God bless <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gordon-strachan">Gordon Strachan</a> who did some research on the street and building where Dad lived which we went and visited, that was wonderful. I love being in Scotland, I absolutely do.</p>
      <p>"It's very important to me to maintain a connection and the two boys are very aware of it. They are Scotland football supporters, they support Scotland at rugby and are Celtic fans. They are aware of the tartan blood inside them."</p>
