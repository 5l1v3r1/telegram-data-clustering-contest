      <p>“I am not the only Musician involved in politics. Bob Marley was a politician. As long as Ghana is a multiparty Democratic state, I have every right to associate myself to a particular political party. Those who even openly claim to be neutral, secretly belong to a particular political party.” He said.</p>
      <p>The president of the Ghana Music Rights Organisation (GHAMRO) added, “ If elected into the Government, I have a lot to offer. I feel that if I’m in the government as the creative arts Minister, I know I can bring a lot of change to the entertainment industry and it doesn’t matter on which political ticket I bring forth these positive Changes. Rex Omar disclosed on Asempa FM.</p>
      <p>Rex Omar further stated that the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture is failing because people with little or no knowledge about the industry have been given the mandate to lead it.</p>
      <p>“ if the right people are elected to represent the entertainment industry, a lot of things will change. The challenges the industry is facing will be dealt with.” He bemoaned.</p>
