            <b>CRY Vs LIV Dream11 And Match Report: Liverpool get their league challenge back underway with the side playing against Crystal Palace today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Although it’s still early days into the ongoing edition of the showpiece premier League, Liverpool will know that they hold a clear advantage over Manchester City as things stand. The side are the only unbeaten side in the league, winning 11 out of their 12 encounters to accumulate the 34 points to sit eight points ahead of second Manchester City as they make an advent into gameweek 13 of the league.</p>
          <p>The 3-1 defeat the side had marauded their way to in the foregone contest could end up being a defining moment in their journey to claiming a Premier League title which has evaded them for way too long. It was not just the win, but rather the manner it came about in with Liverpool showing fight, character, resolve, will, fortitude and vigour to systematically tear apart and cut short City’s game which has seen the side be hailed for their enigmatic and enterprising brand of football.</p>

                <p>It was a performance which exulted a bedlam of euphoria, a display the side will be looking to reverberate when they go at loggerheads against Crystal Palace today. With Manchester City facing yet another dicey encounter against Chelsea later in the day, the table toppers will know that a win for them today could end up taking them 11 points clear at the top of the league at the culmination of this action packed Saturday.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere for the home side who find themselves in 12th place, today’s match is going to be an extremely arduous test. The side are on a downward spiral, coming into today’s tie wit two straight defeats to sit winless in their last four outings with the most recent being a 2-0 thumping by Chelsea.</p>

                            <h3>Top Goal Scorer</h3>

                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Mane: 7 Goals</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>CRY Vs LIV Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Crystal Palace’s Vincent Guaita will be inducted into our side for this encounter. Over the course of the last few encounters, the player has emerged as a key component of his side’s travails, a shot stopper who has pulled of a slew of well cued saves to rescue his side from embarking defeats.</p>
                            <p>If Crystal Palace are going to have any chance of salvaging any for this tie, they’ll be requiring him to at the pinnacle of his skill set to see us move forward with him for this clash owing to the saves he’s bound to pull off for us.</p>
                            <h3>CRY Vs LIV Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Although Andrew Robertson is unlikely to play this one, Jurgen Klopp has refused to rule him out for the encounter to see us stick with him till now for this encounter. In case he misses out when the teams are announced, we’ll be moving him out of our side but the four assists he’s managed to pull off till now make him an extremely tantalising choice for this prevelant encounter.</p>
                            <p>His counterpart, Trent Alexander-Arnold will be partnering him up for the day whilst we have gone in with the lone option for the home side as well with Martin Kelly being our choice for the day.</p>
                            <h3>CRY Vs LIV Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Another player who is doubtful to ply his skill set today for the visiting side today is Mohammed Salah but the escalated ole he played in the side’s practice sessions prior to the encounter have arisen chances of him partaking in this one. We are going to gamble and stick him in our side after the goal he got against Manchester City with the wide attacking layer always carrying a goal threat. </p>
                            <p>Sadio mane, the team’s leading goal scorer with the seven goals will be partnering him up alongside James Milner, someone who is set to lay today if Robertson misses out. From the opposition meanwhile, we have decided to select Luka Milivojevic with the midfielder being on penalty duties for his side, something which makes him a safe option.</p>
                            <p>Wilfred Zaha has been in torrid form but he’s the side’s best bet to fathom together a goal and with Liverpool showing gaping holes in defence this season, Zaha might just end up breaking free off his appalling form in this clash.</p>
                            <h3>CRY Vs LIV Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>The goals have dried up for Roberto Firmino but Liverpool’s striker Roberto Firmino is never too far away from crafting together a gol for his side. He’s been persistently involved up the park for his side with his versatility seeing him not only being ever present in goal scoring positions but transitioning the ball from defence to attack as well.</p>
                            <p>Rhian Brewster might get a chance to play this one, especially if Salah misses out to see us bring him in as well from Liverpool and wrap up our Dream 11 side for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Firmino will be handed over duties of being our side’s captain whilst Mane is the vice-captain.</p>
