      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Khloe-Kardashian">Khloé Kardashian</a> isn't letting the Winter chill stop her from taking on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Summer-Nail-Art-Trends-46139331">one of Summer's most popular nail trends</a>. The reality star and Good American founder took to her Instagram Story on Thursday to show off her new <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Holographic-Nail-Powders-46499228">holographic nails</a> that'll bring the perfect amount of excitement to just about any holiday party look.</p>
      <p>According to the Story Kardashian posted, the look was created by an artist at Hollywood's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/modernpampersalon/">Modern Pamper Salon</a>, who used polish from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kiaraskynails/">Kiara Sky Nails</a> to pull it off. Normally, dark colors are what tend to take up the most space on our Winter nail mood boards, but now that we've seen Kardashian's nails, we're willing to make an exception for holographic nails too. Take a look at her manicure below.</p>
