      <p>NEW DELHI: Indiaâ€™s unemployment rate in urban areas for all ages was 9.3% in the January-March quarter of 2019 compared to 9.9% in the trailing three month period, the National Statistical Office(NSO) said in the Quarterly Bulletin on estimates of labour force indicators for urban areas on Saturday.</p>
      <p>However, unemployment among those aged between 15-29 years was 22.5% in the quarter ending March 2019, from 23.7% in the preceding quarter.</p>
      <p>The NSO launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) on April 2017. The first Annual Report (July 2017-June 2018) covering both rural and urban areas giving estimates of all important parameters of employment and unemployment was released in May 2019.</p>
      <p>To measure the dynamics in labour force participation and employment status in the short time interval of three months, for the urban areas only, a Quarterly Bulletin is brought out giving estimates of labour force indicators. This Bulletin for the Quarter ending March 2019 is the second in the series.</p>
      <p>As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above dripped to 46.5% in January-March from 46.8% in the previous quarter. Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also declined to 19.1% from 19.5% in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4% in January-March from 73.6% in October-December.</p>
      <p>Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in the first quarter of calendar 2018 was 37.7%, lower than 38.2% in the last three months of 2018.</p>
      <p>State-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6% and 6%, respectively.</p>
      <p>Still, the labour force participation rate - the percentage of population making up the labour force - which had slowly edged up between April and December last year, recorded a dip to 36% during the March quarter, the report showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia's third largest economy.</p>
      <p>Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.</p>
      <p><b>Drinking water and sanitation<br/></b>Only around 48.6% households in rural areas had exclusive access to a principal source of drinking water while 57.5% of households in urban areas had exclusive access to such a source between July and December 2018 according to an NSO report on drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and housing condition. Almost 12.3% of rural households and 9.1% of urban households did not have sufficient access to drinking water throughout the year from the principal source of water according to the survey. About 42.9% of rural households used hand pumps as the principal source of drinking water and 40.9% urban households using water piped into their dwelling as a principal source of water during the period. 56.6% of rural households had access to a bathroom while 91.2% of urban households had access to a bathroom during the period with 50.3% of rural households and 75% of urban households having exclusive access to a bathroom during the period.</p>
      <p><b>Education<br/></b>The literacy rate in India among people above the age of seven was 77.7% between July 2017 and June 2018, the NSO said in a separate report. Literacy in rural areas was lower at 73.5% compared to 87.7% in urban areas. Around 13.6% of Indians between the ages of 3 and 35 never enrolled in school with 15.7% of people living in rural Indian never enrolling and 8.3% of people living in urban areas never enrolling for education. The average expenditure during the academic year for students between ages 3-35 pursuing a general course was Rs 5,240 in urban areas and Rs 16,308 in urban areas while average expenditure for a technical or professional course was Rs 32,137 in rural areas and Rs 64,763 in urban areas.</p>
      <p><b>Health<br/></b>Average medical expenditure per hospitalisation case (excluding childbirth) in rural India about was Rs 16,676 in rural areas and Rs 26,475 in urban India. As per the survey report on Household social consumption related to health, the expenditure in government hospitals was about about Rs 4,290 in rural and Rs 4,837 in urban areas per hospitalisation between July 2017 and June 2018.</p>
      <p>However, in private hospitals the expenditure was about about Rs 27,347 in rural and Rs 38,822 in urban area per instance of hospitalization. Private hospiatals accounted for 55% of all hospitalisations excluding those for childbirth and public hospitals accounted for 42% of such hospitalisations. Only about 14% of the rural population and 19% of the urban population reported that they had adequate health expenditure coverage with 13% of the rural population and 9% of the urban population reporting that they were covered by government sponsored insurance. Only around 59% of boys and 60% of girls under the age of five received all eight prescribed vaccinations, even though 97% of both boys and girls in rural India had received some vaccinations and 98% of boys and 97% of girls had received vaccinations in urban India.</p>
      <p><b>Persons with disabilities<br/></b>In India, the prevalence of disability (percentage of persons with disability in the population) was 2.2% with 2.3% in rural and 2% in urban areas in July-December 2018.</p>
      <p>Prevalence of disability was higher among males than females. Among males, prevalence of disability was 2.4% while it was 1.9% among females. These were the findings of an NSO Survey of Persons with Disabilities during July-December 2018. Prior to this, survey on the same subject was carried out by NSO from July-December 2002.</p>
      <p>Among persons with disabilities of age 7 years and above, 52.2% were literate. Among persons with disabilities of age 15 years and above, Labour Force Participation Rate in usual status was 23.8% while the unemployment rate was 4.2%, the survey report showed.</p>
