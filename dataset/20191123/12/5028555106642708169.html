      <h1>Suspect can’t be compelled to reveal “64-character” password, court rules</h1>
      <h2>Prosecutors say forced disclosure permitted by “foregone conclusion.” Justices disagree.</h2>

      <p>The Fifth Amendment to the US Constitution bars people from being forced to turn over personal passwords to police, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled this week.</p>
      <p>In a 4-3 ruling, justices from Pennsylvania’s highest court overturned a lower-court order that required the suspect in a child-pornography case to turn over a 64-character password to his computer. The lower-court ruling had held that the compelled disclosure didn’t violate the defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights because of statements he made to police during questioning.</p>
      <p>“It’s 64 characters and why would I give that to you,” Joseph J. Davis of Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County told investigators in response to their request for his password. “We both know what’s on there. It’s only going to hurt me. No fucking way I’m going to give it to you.”</p>
      <h3>A foregone conclusion</h3>
      <p>Prosecutors in the case said a legal doctrine known as the “foregone conclusion exception” permitted the compelled disclosure of Davis’ password. The doctrine, which originally applied to the compelled production of paper documents, said Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination don’t apply when the government already knew of the existence, location, and content of the sought-after material.</p>
      <p>In requiring Davis to turn over his password to investigators, the lower-court agreed with prosecutors that the password demand fell under the foregone conclusion exemption. The lower court said the exception applied because, under previous US Supreme Court precedent, the password was tantamount to a key or other tangible property and didn’t reveal the “contents” of the defendant’s mind.</p>
      <p>The majority for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court disagreed. Writing for the majority in a <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-42-2019mo%20-%2010422940787775633.pdf?cb=1">ruling handed down on Wednesday</a>, Justice Debra Todd wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Based upon these cases rendered by the United States Supreme Court regarding the scope of the Fifth Amendment, we conclude that compelling the disclosure of a password to a computer, that is, the act of production, is testimonial. Distilled to its essence, the revealing of a computer password is a verbal communication, not merely a physical act that would be nontestimonial in nature. There is no physical manifestation of a password, unlike a handwriting sample, blood draw, or a voice exemplar. As a passcode is necessarily memorized, one cannot reveal a passcode without revealing the contents of one’s mind. Indeed, a password to a computer is, by its nature, intentionally personalized and so unique as to accomplish its intended purpose―keeping information contained therein confidential and insulated from discovery. Here, under United States Supreme Court precedent, we find that the Commonwealth is seeking the electronic equivalent to a combination to a wall safe—the passcode to unlock Appellant’s computer. The Commonwealth is seeking the password, not as an end, but as a pathway to the files being withheld. As such, the compelled production of the computer’s password demands the recall of the contents of Appellant’s mind, and the act of production carries with it the implied factual assertions that will be used to incriminate him. Thus, we hold that compelling Appellant to reveal a password to a computer is testimonial in nature.</blockquote>
      <h3>Heavy lifting</h3>
      <p>Referring to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Justice Todd went on to say:</p>
      <blockquote>We acknowledge that, at times, constitutional privileges are an impediment to the Commonwealth. Requiring the Commonwealth to do the heavy lifting, indeed, to shoulder the entire load, in building and bringing a criminal case without a defendant’s assistance may be inconvenient and even difficult; yet, to apply the foregone conclusion rationale in these circumstances would allow the exception to swallow the constitutional privilege. Nevertheless, this constitutional right is firmly grounded in the “realization that the privilege, while sometimes ‘a shelter to the guilty,’ is often ‘a protection to the innocent.’” Moreover, there are serious questions about applying the foregone conclusion exception to information that manifests through the usage of one’s mind.</blockquote>
      <p>Wednesday’s ruling is a big victory for digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which filed a friend of the court brief in the case. The EFF argued that the forgone conclusion exemption applied only when defendants are forced to comply with a subpoena for business records and when turning over the documents doesn’t reveal the contents of the defendant’s mind.</p>
      <p>"This ruling is vital because courts must account for how constitutional rights are affected by changes in technology," EFF Senior Staff Attorney Andrew Crocker <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/victory-pennsylvania-supreme-court-rules-police-cant-force-you-tell-them-your">wrote</a>. "We store a wealth of deeply personal information on our electronic devices. The government simply should not put individuals in the no-win situation of choosing between disclosing a password—and turning over everything on these devices—or instead defying a court order to do so."</p>
      <p>Wednesday’s decision is only the latest of many court rulings on whether compelled password disclosure is a form of self-testimony that’s barred by the Fifth Amendment. Over the years, other courts have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/10/court-teens-driving-killed-someone-but-he-cant-be-forced-to-give-up-passcode/">arrived</a> at <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/09/forcing-suspects-to-reveal-phone-passwords-is-unconstitutional-court-says/">similar</a> opinions. Other court decisions, such as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/judge-fifth-amendment-doesnt-protect-encrypted-hard-drives/">this one</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/judge-wont-release-man-jailed-2-years-for-refusing-to-decrypt-drives/">this one,</a> suggest that depending on the facts of a case or other factors, the Fifth Amendment isn't an iron-clad protection against compelled password disclosure. Currently, Supreme Courts in both <a href="https://www.in.gov/judiciary/files/order-other-2019-18S-CR-595.pdf">Indiana</a> and <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/2018/a0291-17.html">New Jersey</a> have similar cases before them.</p>
