      <p><b>Mumbai</b><b>: </b>Profit bookings in key counters such as banking along with subdued foreign fund inflows and a weak rupee pulled the key indices of the Indian equity markets lower on Friday.</p>
      <p>Consequently, both S&amp;P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty50 slid during the day’s trade.</p>
      <p>Sector-wise, heavy selling pressure was observed in IT, banking and capital goods stocks, whereas the scrip of metal and automobile companies saw healthy pick-up.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P BSE Sensex closed at 40,359.41 points, down 215.76 points, or by 0.53 per cent, over the previous close of 40,575.17 points.</p>
      <p>After opening at 40,653.17 points, the Sensex swayed between an intra-day high of 40,653.17 and low of 40,276.83.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Nifty50 of the National Stock Exchange closed at 11,914.40, lower by 54 points, or by 0.45 per cent, over its previous close.</p>
      <p>However, broader market indices like the BSE mid-cap and small-cap outperformed both the Sensex and Nifty.</p>
      <p>“Carrying on from the previous session, markets continued to slide lower on Friday as selling pressure continued,” HDFC Securities’ Retail Research Head Deepak Jasani told IANS.</p>
      <p>“It was the second consecutive session of losses for the Nifty,” he added.</p>
      <p>According to Joseph K. Thomas, Head of Research, Emkay Wealth Management: “The weakness in banking and IT stocks was the major contributing factor behind dragging the markets down in today’s trading session.</p>
      <p>“The support received from the recent run-up in key telecom counters was also missing today. On the technical front, the level of 12,000 is seen as a key resistance by many market participants, which adds up to the selling pressure. We believe post the short duration of profit booking, markets should reverse on a much more stronger footing.” (IANS)</p>
