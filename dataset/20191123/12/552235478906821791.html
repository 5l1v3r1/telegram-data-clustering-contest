      <p>A 14-year-old boy missing in East Kilbride has been found safe and well.</p>
      <p>We told you early on Saturday how Aiden Lochrie had not been seen since 2.45pm on Friday afternoon.</p>
      <p>That led to a frantic search and online appeal to trace the missing Duncanrig Secondary pupil.</p>

      <p>Family and friends of the schoolboy took to social media in a desperate plea for information.</p>
      <p>Thankfully in a statement at just after midday on Saturday, Police Scotland said the teenager had been found.</p>
      <p>It simply read: “Aiden Lochrie, who had been missing from East Kilbride since Friday, November 22, has now been traced safe and well.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to everyone who shared our post.”</p>
