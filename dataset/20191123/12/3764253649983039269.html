        <b>- Senate has resolved to move against VIP loan defaulters</b>

      </p>
      <p>In its efforts to ensure that the defaulters of federal government loans cough out the public funds, the chairman, Senate committee on banking, insurance and other financial institutions, Senator Uba Sani, said his committee has resolved to join hands with the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) to push for the recovery of N5 trillion debts owed by high profile Nigerians.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b>'s regional reporter in Kaduna, Nasir Dambatta, reports that the senator said the committee would mobilise the executive, judicial <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1148362-the-arms-government-nigeria-functions.html">arms of government</a> and the civil society to demand for its recovery.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the end of a retreat organised by AMCON in Kaduna on Wednesday, November 20, Sani expressed displeasure over the mounting debt profile of the agency.</p>

      <p>He said the committee lamented that after sinking the humongous Nigerian resources to the tune of N4 trillion into taking over non-performing loan assets of banks, AMCON could only boasts of N800 billion assets.</p>
      <p>Describing the situation as unacceptable, the lawmaker said the committee resolved to confront the AMCON's problem frontally, adding that the institution has become a huge drain on the national economy.</p>
      <p>Senator Sani also noted that the committee frowned at,<i> "a situation where only 350 well-heeled Nigerians account for about 70% of the non-performing loans which have remained a source of instability in our financial system."</i></p>
      <p>He stressed that the committee, however, commended President Muhammadu Buhari for setting up a task force for the recovery of the over N5 trillion debts and signing into law the AMCON (amendment) act 2019 which gave<i> "sweeping powers to the corporation to monitor activities of the Nigerian debtors to ensure they do not unduly take advantage of the weakness in the country's banking systems."</i></p>

      <p>According to him, the committee resolved to close ranks with AMCON in the compilation of a comprehensive list of Nigeria's high-profile debtors and publish their names without delay except the persons in question commence immediate repayment of their loans.</p>
      <p>Senator Sani also revealed that part of the steps to be taken by the committee towards successful recovery of the debt <i>"is to engage with the executive, judiciary and civil society to fashion out workable strategy to fast-track this recovery of Nigeria's loan assets."</i></p>
      <p>He said other steps the committee was planning to take would include inviting the founding fathers of AMCON to rub minds with it on the rationale for committing such incredible amount of resources to debts incurred by Nigerians who have shown scant regard to growth and development of our economy.</p>
