      <p>Boots pharmacy customers will start receiving their medicines in a different type of bag - ones that are completely compostable.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/environment">eco-friendly</a> bags are made using potato starch and can be used as a bin line for food waste.</p>
      <p>By March 2020, more than 10 million prescription bags each year will be made using compostable material rather than traditional plastic.</p>
      <p>Boots also has plans to reduce its plastic use by around 1,300 tonnes per year. This includes removing 149 tonnes of plastic from own-brand <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> gift ranges; reducing the plastic packaging used in its deliveries by 76 percent saving 136 tonnes of plastic every year.</p>
      <p>The Nottingham-based retailing giant also wants be 100 percent plastic free in online deliveries by the end of 2020.</p>

      <p>Richard Bradley, Pharmacy Director at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/boots">Boots UK</a>, said, “This is yet another positive step forward in our focus on sustainability throughout our 170 year history, and the current journey we are on to reduce the impact our business has on the environment.</p>
      <p>"At the start of this year, our customers told us they didn’t want to receive their medicines in plastic bags and we have been testing alternative materials for some time.</p>
      <p>"So, we are thrilled that our new compostable bags allow us to continue to deliver medicines to patients in a way that is safe, clean and dry, whilst helping to reduce our reliance on conventional plastic.”</p>
