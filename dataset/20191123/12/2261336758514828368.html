      <h1>Wilder vs. Ortiz 2 purses: Deontay Wilder guaranteed about $20 million, Luis Ortiz $7 million</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mookie Alexander</a></address>
      <p>The official purses for the Deontay Wilder vs. Luis Ortiz rematch list Wilder at $3 million and Ortiz at $1.5 million. Of course, high-level boxers usually are making much more than that for major shows, but since not everyone will read past the headline, the actual guarantees are in there.</p>
      <p>Wilder is one of the highest paid boxers in the world, and both <a href="https://theathletic.com/1400416/2019/11/22/inside-the-making-of-wilder-fury-2-the-fight-that-brings-al-haymon-and-bob-arum-together-at-last/">The Athletic</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/now?nowId=1-28137130">ESPN</a> report that the WBC heavyweight champion’s real guarantee is about $20 million. As for Ortiz, who spurned a late replacement bout vs. Anthony Joshua — this wound up going to Andy Ruiz Jr instead — he’s getting a career-high of roughly $7 million for what is his pay-per-view debut.</p>
      <p>As for the rest of the card, there are defined A-side and B-side payouts, which is to say it’s lopsided as hell. Leo Santa Cruz is guaranteed roughly $2 million for his vacant WBA super featherweight title against Miguel Flores, whose purse is listed at just $100,000. With that said, it’s also common for even unheralded foreign fighters to have under-reported payouts for US cards (usually for tax reasons), so it would not be surprising if Flores was making more.</p>
      <p>The next highest earner on the undercard is 122 lbs contender Brandon Figueroa, who’s getting $200,000 to Julio Ceja’s $50,000. As of this writing, the splits are probably different given Ceja missed weight by 4.5 lbs, so Ceja might be giving some of his purse to Figueroa. Meanwhile, bantamweight contender Luis Nery missed weight yet again, and wouldn’t even shed that one-pound overage for his bout vs. Manny Rodriguez. No agreement on money or weight could be reached, so the fight is cancelled. Had the fight gone through with Nery making weight, he would’ve had a purse of $300,000.</p>
