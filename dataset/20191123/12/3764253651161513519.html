      <p>Crystal Palace have reportedly joined the chase to land want-away Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud when the January transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup-winning star has made just five appearances for the Blues under Frank Lampard across all competitions this campaign.</p>
      <p>Giroud's current deal with the Stamford Bridge side expires next June but the club are hoping they can cash in on him in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is behind Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi in the order of preferred strikers by Lampard.</p>

      <p>Chelsea have set around £5million price tag on the player before allowing him to leave in January since both parties failed to agree on a new term.</p>
