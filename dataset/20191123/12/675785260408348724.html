      <h2>Ortiz is bidding to upset Wilder's plans to rematch Tyson Fury next year by beating the heavyweight world champion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder puts his heavyweight world title on the line tonight in his rematch with dangerous Cuban Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>The pair first met 18 months ago when Ortiz rocked the champion before being stopped in the 10th round.</p>
      <p>The challenger has vowed to make Wilder pay for accepting a second fight with him but the champion insists he has learned his lesson and will have his hand raised again.</p>
      <p>Should he come through, Wilder will book another sequel, this time with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> with whom he fought to a controversial draw last December.</p>
      <p>Here is everything you need to know about tonight's fights...</p>
      <h3>What TV channel is it on?</h3>
      <p>The fight is being broadcast on Sky Sports in the UK. Sky Sports Action will show the fight with the programme starting at 2am.</p>

      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>Tyson Fury has warned <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> to avoid any injuries or slip-ups against Luis Ortiz this weekend.</p>
      <p>The WBC king defends his strap in a rematch against experienced Cuban Ortiz.</p>
      <p>But Fury is more concerned with his own money-spinning second fight with Wilder, pencilled in for February 2020.</p>
      <p>Having suffered a nasty cut in his last outing against Otto Wallin, Fury knows the dangers faced in the ring no matter who the opponent.</p>
      <p>He has just started training ahead of his Wilder rematch and, whilst out on a run, warned Wilder he must do his bit to keep things on track for the start of next year.</p>
      <p>In a video message on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , Fury said: "Just out running, doing a six-miler.</p>
      <p>"February 22nd, Las Vegas, I'm coming for you baby. Training hard, training right through Christmas.</p>
      <p>"Wilder, don't be taking any days off mush.</p>
      <p>"Don't be getting injured in your return fight.</p>
      <p>"Get it done and meet me for battle.</p>
      <p>"February 22nd, Las Vegas, Nevada, 2020."</p>
