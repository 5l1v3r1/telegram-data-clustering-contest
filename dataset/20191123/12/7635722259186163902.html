        <b>A superb second-half try from John Cooney helped Dan McFarland's Ulster to a famous victory over Clermont last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They were 18-13 winners over the Top 14 side in driving rain at Kingspan Stadium in Belfast.</p>
      <p>Jordi Murphy got Ulster's opening try, and they've got two wins from their opening two games in Pool 3 of the Heineken Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>“Anytime you play a French giant in the Champions Cup and you manage to win the game you have to be happy with that, there is a lot to be very pleased about in that performance," McFarland said after the game.</p>
      <p>“Particularly with the way we limited their opportunities when they had the ball in hand; that was going to be a real threat and I said before the game we had to hunt like a pack and bring collective pressure. We had to do that constantly and I felt we did that.</p>
      <p>“Jared and his preparation of the team and the amount of effort the guys put in did that; on the reserve side we showed glimpses of what we can do in attack.</p>
      <p>“If we had been a little more clinical right at the end we’d have had two more tries and they wouldn’t have got a bonus point but I’m probably being a little bit picky there given we won the game.</p>
      <p>"The conditions were really difficult again and I don’t think we’ve had a dry match here this year, somebody said to me Clermont are going to hate the wet conditions but that is a stereotype of Irish teams - we’re not like that; we want a dry track and that is how we play: we want to move the ball.</p>
      <p>“We want to keep it in play and we want to tire them out. It was pleasing that we showed those glimpses in attack.”</p>
