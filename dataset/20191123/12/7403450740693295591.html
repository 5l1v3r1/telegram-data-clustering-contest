        <i>BloombergQuint’s Big Decisions podcast gets you the insights you need to make big money decisions with confidence.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The best way to achieve a financial goal is to regularly set aside funds, invest them appropriately, so that you won’t have to scramble when you need the money.</p>
      <p>Systematic investment plans or SIPs—monthly investments in mutual funds—are a great way to do this. But these too are susceptible to the vagaries of the market. It’s something most financial planners will ask you to be wary of, especially in case of equity investments.</p>
      <p>A decline in equities, protracted or sudden, could set your financial goals back by years. On this BQ Big Decisions podcast, BloombergQuint speaks to Harshvardhan Roongta, certified financial planner and founder of Roongta Securities, about a secured way to achieve your most important financial goals.</p>
