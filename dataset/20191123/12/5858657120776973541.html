      <p>FORT ST. JOHN (NEWS 1130) — As the strike at CN Rail enters its first weekend, canola and wheat farmers in the Peace River district are getting increasingly nervous.</p>
      <p>After a difficult season has already delayed their harvest, farmers are hoping the strike won’t last too long since the railway is a critical route for wheat and canola on their way to international markets.</p>
      <p>President of the <a href="http://bcgrain.com/">BC Grain Producers Association,</a> Rick Kantz, says while their harvest can be stored, it’s more important to get it moving, so farmers can have it dried at special facilities and get paid.</p>
      <p>“Seeing the wet weather that we had, a lot of people are dealing with wet grain that needs to be dried. A lot of it is dried through the elevator system, which we can’t access now because they can’t move it,” he says. “So any of the products that did come off, it was all wet and is needing to be mechanically dried – which not everybody has access to on the farms.”</p>

      <p>Kantz explains it has been a very challenging year for farmers since the wet weather delayed the harvest. Then when they were finally able to cut their crops, they were pelted with more rain and snow.</p>
      <p>Kantz says there are about 300 farmers in this situation.</p>
      <p>He also points out some growers who supply the domestic market can use trucks to transport their goods, but for those with international customers, rail is the only way to go.</p>
      <p>Talks between Canadian National and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference continue.</p>
