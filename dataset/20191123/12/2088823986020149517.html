      <p>It has always been a family affair for Daniel Cane.</p>
      <p>It started in 1979 when he was in New York City visiting siblings.</p>
      <p>“I looked out their apartment window early in the morning, and there were people running,” Cane said. “Oh, it’s a race!”</p>
      <p>That caught his attention and seemed like something he’d like to try.</p>
      <p>“Running wasn’t a big thing when I was a kid,” said Cane, who lives in Depew. “I played baseball, basketball, football, but I started running just for fun. It’s a great time.”</p>
      <p>Running is such a good time that he keeps coming back to the annual YMCA Turkey Trot. This year, Cane will be running in his 36th Turkey Trot.</p>
      <p>Cane is one of 320 members of the race’s Quarter Century Club, open to anyone who has completed 25 or more YMCA Buffalo Niagara Turkey Trots. The VIP Reception and Quarter Century Club were introduced in 2005 with 34 charter members. More than 30 names will be added this year.</p>
      <p>While Cane’s interest in running was piqued by that visit to New York City, he first entered the Turkey Trot to run with his friends from his old neighborhood.</p>

      <p> “A couple of kids from grammar school that I grew up with decided to run it,” Cane said of his introduction to the race. “We’ve done it many years together. I really enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to be an elite runner to run the Turkey Trot. You can be a plodder, like me. There are plenty of walkers also in this race. And all age groups. You’ve got kids 6 or 7 years old to senior citizens doing this. It keeps bringing them back.</p>
      <p>“It’s more of a family event now. Families are getting their kids involved and they’ve made it a whole morning tradition. That’s what I think is the best part of it – family. I get to see people I haven’t seen for a long time.”</p>
      <p>It’s a family affair for Cane, as well, as his two sons have run various Turkey Trots with him. His wife is the transportation vehicle, making sure Cane and whomever he happens to see gets to the starting line for the race and back to his car after the post-race party.</p>
      <p>And then there’s the running family you create out on the course, usually out of complete strangers.</p>
      <p>“One thing about runners, they don’t criticize other runners,” Cane said. "We’re all out there. If some older man is out there, I think, ‘I hope I can do that as his age.’ If I see a woman struggling, I say, ‘Don’t worry. You’re out here. All your friends are probably sleeping.’ I tell people they’re doing a great job. You try to encourage people.”</p>
      <p>Through his 35 years of running the Turkey Trot, Cane has come to dislike slush over very cold temperatures. The worst part about slush is that your feet get wet and can never get warm again. Cold temperatures just mean adding layers.</p>
      <p>His favorite part of the course is “when you hit North Street and it’s all downhill,” Cane said. “That’s the best part. The crowds get thicker toward the end of the race, too, and that’s a great feeling.”</p>
