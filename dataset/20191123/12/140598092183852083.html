      <p>Tough terrain has hampered search crews in Australia as the hunt for a missing British man continues.</p>
      <p>Aslan King, 25, was camping with friends near Princetown, along Victoria's famous Great Ocean Road, when he hit his head at around 2am local time on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He reportedly got up suddenly and ran from the camping area into surrounding bushland.</p>
      <p>His friends searched but were unable to find him.</p>
      <p>He is described as medium build with short dark hair. He was wearing a grey tracksuit and hoodie and may have blood on his forehead.</p>
      <p>The Foreign Office said in a statement: "Our staff are seeking further information following the disappearance of a British man near Princetown, Australia and are in contact with the Australian police."</p>
      <p>Police on horse back and off-road motorcycles and the Victorian Police airwing helicopter have been used in the search. </p>
      <p>It is understood Mr King had only been in Australia for two weeks. </p>
