      <p>Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale has gotten himself into another trouble after his alleged attack on Kweku Smoke some days ago.</p>
      <p>It would be remembered that Kweku Smoke some weeks ago came out and accused Shatta Wale of stealing his song titled ‘On Dem’ after he had played the song to him in his(Shatta Wale) studio when they met to vibe.</p>
      <p>Things went out of hands when Shatta Wale threatened to beat up Kweku Smoke whenever their path crossed and true to his words, he allegedly carried out the action according to Kweku Smoke.</p>
      <p>Well, Kweku Smoke who is not backing down has recorded a diss song to the self-acclaimed King of Dancehall.</p>
      <p>Kweku Smoke this morning shared the video to the song on his timeline on social media with the caption;</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Good morning Woke Up Good Today Thank God , Had To Test The Mic …Think Am Getting better”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Watch the video below:</p>
      <p>Social media has been on fire since the release of Kweku Smoke’s diss song. We are patiently waiting to see if Shatta Wale would respond to him or just leave him in peace.</p>
