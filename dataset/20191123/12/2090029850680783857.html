      <p>The pair fled Belgium in the aftermath of the murder only to resurface two decades later in <a href="https://lailasnews.com/tag/ivory-coast/">Ivory Coast</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“The two were arrested in Abidjan. Lacote on Wednesday night and Mrs Van Acker on Thursday morning,” Brussels prosecutors spokesman Celine D’Have told AFP.</blockquote>
      <p>The couple after fleeing Europe, initially settled in Brazil then ended up in South Africa where he launched his reality TV career, hosting ten episodes of a reality crime programme Duty Calls, according to a 2016 report in Britain’s Independent daily.</p>
      <p>The programme highlighted how the police “dealt with violent criminals and dangerous crime scenes”. After finding himself in prison awaiting trial on a string of frauds, he also escaped when his then girlfriend Van Acker posed along with others as police officers with fake paperwork, the report added.</p>
      <p>Belgian prosecutors will ask for the couple to be extradited from the Ivory Coast.</p>
