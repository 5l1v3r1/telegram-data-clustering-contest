      <p>Exceptionally rare treasure <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> back to the ‘birth of England’ has been lost to the nation after two metal detectives stole buried loot worth up to £12m.</p>
      <p>The ancient Viking hoard included a ninth-century gold ring, dragon’s head bracelet and fifth century crystal rock pendant, which experts said gave fresh information about England’s unification.</p>
      <p>Two men behind the theft, George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, were jailed this week after failing to declare the haul found on Herefordshire farmland on June 2 2015.</p>
      <p>It is thought the trove, much of which has yet to be recovered, was buried by someone serving in the Great Viking Army in either 878 or 879, as they were driven east by an alliance of Saxon forces previously not thought to exist between the kings of Mercia and Wessex.</p>
      <p>Ringerleader Powell was jailed for 10 years while caretaker Davies received eight-and-a-half years.</p>

      <p>Both were convicted alongside two others, 60-year-old Paul Wells and Simon Wicks, 57, for conspiring to conceal the find.</p>

      <p>Sentencing at Worcester Crown Court on Friday, Judge Nicholas Cartwright said the thieves ‘cheated’ not only the landowner but the public of ‘exceptionally rare and significant’ treasures with about 90% of the coins still to be recovered.</p>
      <p>Judge Cartwright said: ‘All four defendants played their respective parts.</p>
      <p>‘You, Simon Wicks, were part of a conspiracy to conceal the stolen treasure and to sell it.</p>
      <p>‘Paul Wells, who will be sentenced a on future occasion, was part of a conspiracy to conceal part of the stolen treasure.’</p>
      <p>Under the Treasure Act, anything found that is more than 300 years old should be reported to the local coroners office within 14 days and its value shared between those who discovered it, as well as landlords and other stakeholders.</p>

      <p>The Judge added: ‘The irony in this case is if you, George Powell, and you, Layton Davies, had obtained the permissions and agreements which responsible metal detectorists are advised to obtain, if you had gone on to act within the law after you found this treasure, you could have expected to have either a half share, or at very worst a third share of over £3 million to share between the two of you.</p>

      <p>‘You could not have done worse than £500,000 each.</p>
      <p>‘But you wanted more.’</p>
      <p>Only 31 of the 300 coins, some dating to the reign of King Alfred – Alfred the Great – have been recovered, although deleted photographs on Davies’s phone found by police showed the larger hoard intact, in a freshly dug hole.</p>
      <p>Five of the coins are examples of the exceptionally rare Two Emperors penny, so-called as they depict King Alfred and a lesser known monarch, Ceolwulf II, who reigned in the old kingdom of Mercia. They are valued at up to £50,000 each.</p>

      <p>The monetary value of the hoard so far recovered, now held at the British Museum, stands at £581,000.</p>
      <p>Wicks, Powell and Davies were also found guilty of converting the finding into cash, after police traced several coins sold to private collectors, hidden, or left with expert valuers.</p>
      <p>Powell, from Newport, Davies, from Pontypridd, Wells from Cardiff and Wicks from Hailsham, East Sussex, were also convicted after trial of ignoring the law stating such finds must be properly declared.</p>
      <p>Wells was not present in court after being taken ill on Thursday. He is due to be sentenced for his part next month.</p>
      <p>Coin collector Wicks, who had previous convictions for using a metal detector without the landowner’s permission, known as ‘night hawking’, was jailed for five years.</p>

      <p>Prosecuting barrister Kevin Hegarty QC said an expert valuation  had found the hoard could be worth between £3 to £12 million, adding a find of ‘immense archaeological, historical and academic value’ had been lost to the nation.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Mr Hegarty said: ‘As a direct result of the actions of the defendants, a significant and irreversible harm has been caused to the site.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The Leominster Hoard represents a nationally important assemblage created at the very point England was forming and becoming a nation with a single identity under the vision of Alfred the Great.</p>
      <p>‘As such this hoard should be considered emblematic of a period where English identity was being formed.’</p>
      <p>Both Powell and Davies tried to claim talk of a 300-coin hoard had been a rumour and insisted all coins found had been declared to the National Museum Wales, in Cardiff, at a meeting on July 8.</p>

      <p>They came unstuck when police found the deleted photos of a much larger hoard on Davies’s phone and recovered other coins, including five concealed in a magnifying glass case.</p>
      <p>As to the fate of the rest, Powell’s barrister James Tucker told the judge his client, who is a father of two, ‘isn’t in a position to assist’ their recovery.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘It is clear, from his point of view, he wishes he had never found the treasure.</p>
      <p>‘It became a temptation – and for him a curse.’</p>
      <p>There will be a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing in the new year.</p>
