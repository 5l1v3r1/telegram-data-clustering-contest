        <b>Sorry ladies, he is taken</b>
      </p>
      <p>Popular online comedian Henry Desagu (real names Ithagu Kibicho) has confirmed that he is dating YouTuber and actress, Jackline Mbugua.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Betty Kyallo on Up-Close with Betty, the Prince of Mwihoko revealed that he had decided to get a woman who would help him shape his career, support him in his life decisions and at the same time show him love.</p>
      <p>“<i>As a young man, whose profile is out there in the public, it is important to get a woman who loves you and commit to that relationship. If one fails to do that, he will most likely waste his money and time on women, who are only after the fame</i>,” Said Desagu.</p>

        <p>“<i>It is advisable that you identify one woman, stick to her and focus on art if you are an artist. So, Jacque Mbugua is that special woman in my life</i>,” he added.</p>
        <p>Mr Desagu revealed this after much talked about speculations of the two being in a relationship.</p>
        <p>Desagu is a Bachelor of Economics student at Kenyatta University (KU), but is yet to complete his education after he discontinued his studies to pursue comedy. There are two academic units he hasn't taken and therefore cannot graduate from University.</p>
