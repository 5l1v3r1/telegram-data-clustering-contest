      <p><b>Bengaluru vs Kerala Blasters Live Score Streaming, ISL 2019 Live Score Streaming Online: </b>The international break is over, and it resumes with the Southern Derby between Bengaluru and Kerala Blasters, after both the teams have had a mix-and-match season so far.</p>
      <p>Sitting in fifth and seventh on the standings, both Bengaluru and Kerala Blasters would be looking for their second win of the season, but the head-to-head record does favour the former. Carles Cuadrat’s men have been unbeaten against Eelco Schattorie’s side in four matches. The Blues, of course, will be confident about getting another three points after a win in their last outing in the league. Kerala, on the other hand, will be looking to return to winning ways having failed to register a victory in their last three games.</p>
