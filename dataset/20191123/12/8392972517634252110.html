      <p>Love them or loathe them, Brussels sprouts are an integral part of any Yuletide spread.</p>
      <p>But sprouts fans are facing a shortage of their fave veg grown in the UK this Christmas, reports claim.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/fruit-and-veg/wet-weather-means-uk-may-have-to-import-brassicas-warn-growers/599684.article">The Grocer</a> reports that because of the wet weather, sprouts may be in short supply this year.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the British Growers Association (BGA) says that there is only a 'short timescale' for the weather to improve.</p>

      <p>If things don't improve, brassicas like sprouts, cauliflowers, and cabbages will have to be shipped in from abroad to meet demand during the festive period.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said that the record wet weather has made harvesting crops "very difficult".</p>
      <aside>With the chances of things drying out being quite slim, the next step is starting to import.</aside>
      <p>Lincolnshire, which grows 60 per cent of brassicas in this country, has experienced its wettest year so far since 2012.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson went onto say that "with the chances of things drying out being quite slim, the next step is starting to import."</p>

      <p>Actual sprouts may end up in short supply this year, but there's a plethora of sprout-themed products on the market.</p>
      <p>Edinburgh distillers Pickering's has launched a <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/brussels-sprouts-flavoured-gin-launched-for-christmas-divides-opinion-would-you-give-festive-tipple-a-try/">sprouts-flavoured gin</a> for the festive period.</p>
      <p>Believed to be a first in the gin world, reports have claimed the concoction makes use of 10,000 sprouts during production.</p>
      <p>Matt Gammell of Pickering's is reported to have said: "It was an interesting challenge trying to balance the unmistakable flavour of Brussels sprouts to get the taste just right – and the distillery had a very distinct aroma while the gin was being distilled."</p>
