      <h2>He is the first cricketer from the city to be selected for the test squad.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:34:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sumit-Bhattacharjee-621/" target="_blank">Sumit Bhattacharjee</a></address>
      <p>Vizagites, especially those connected to cricket, are in a jubilant mood, as city lad Kone Srikar Bharat has been selected by the BCCI for the Indian test team.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old cricketer has been asked to join the team in the midst of the historic pink ball test match, being played between India and Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>“We have been hoping that he will be selected one day, but it came as a surprise, as he was busy playing Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament,” said his father Srinivasa Rao, an employee of Naval Dockyard.</p>
      <p>Bharat is the first cricketer from Vizag to be selected for the test squad.</p>
      <p>The only other cricketer to make it big from Vizag earlier was Y. Venugopla Rao, who only played one-day internationals.</p>
      <p>Born in 1993, Bharat did his schooling in St. Aloysius and later his degree from Dr. L.B. College.</p>
      <p>“We recognised his talent right from his under-12 days, but he started to flourish from under-16 and under-19 days. He took up wicket keeping from under-19,” said J.K.M. Raju, joint secretary of Visakhapatnam District Cricket Association, who has seen Bharat grow as a cricketer.</p>
      <p>According to many cricketers, who have played and are still playing league cricket with him, say that he is not only a stylish and aggressive batsman, but one of the safest hands behind the stumps.</p>
      <p>“He is one among the top four wicketkeepers in the country today after MS. Dhoni, Wriddhiman Saha and Rishabh Pant,” said SKA Hussain, a former State cricketer.</p>
      <p>Congratulating Bharat, VDCA Secretary K. Parthasarathi said that Bharat is not only a talented wicketkeeper, but also a very good batsman, who can open the innings, as well as play in the middle order.</p>
      <h3>Triple century</h3>
      <p>“He has scored tons of runs in domestic cricket including eight centuries and over 20 half centuries. He was the first wicketkeeper batsman to score a triple century in a Ranji Trophy match,” Mr. Parthasarathi said.</p>
      <p>Many who have played with him, say that he deserved the break. “He worked hard for this day. He would practise for over seven hours a day and his batting is a combination of right temperament and aggression. A perfect blend for test and limited format of the game,” said Mr. Raju.</p>
      <p>“I am sure that he will motivate many cricketers to play the higher format from the city,” said VDCA president and former MLA P. Vishnu Kumar Raju.</p>
