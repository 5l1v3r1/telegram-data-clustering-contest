        <figcaption>Why residents fear Grey Street is "becoming another Bigg Market"</figcaption>

      <p>Controversial plans for a city centre restaurant to double in size face a final verdict next week.</p>
      <p>The Muddler wants to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/newcastle-city-centre-restaurant-muddler-16600223">expand into an empty unit next door</a> to its Grey Street site, opposite the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/theatre-royal">Theatre Royal.</a></p>
      <p>But a rival operator has warned that allowing the move will mean that Muddler “can and will become a bar”, echoing fears from residents that the historic street is becoming “another <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/bigg-market">Bigg Market”.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council</a> was due to decide whether the extension could go ahead last month, but was forced to delay when a licensing hearing was postponed due to a medical emergency.</p>

      <p>A rescheduled meeting of the authority’s licensing sub-committee is set for next Thursday, November 28, when Muddler will discover its fate.</p>
      <p>Barrister Charles Holland, representing Muddler owners Danieli Holdings at October’s hearing,<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/muddler-promises-wont-banging-out-17052602"> said that an expanded Muddler would have to abide by conditions ensuring that it remained a restaurant rather than a bar “banging out drinks”.</a></p>
      <p>He claimed that The Muddler “is not and could not become” a bar, but wants more flexibility to allow customers to drink alcohol without having a meal.</p>
      <p>Mr Holland said: “We have carefully thought about what to do with this very important site. It is opposite what is perhaps the most culturally important building in the city.”</p>
      <p>Richard Arnot, representing Easteye Ltd, claimed there would be “nothing” stopping Muddler becoming a bar if these plans are approved.</p>
      <p>Easteye’s directors, the Ladhar family, run nearby Pleased to Meet You.</p>
      <p>One objecting resident told the council: “<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Grey Street</a>, as I feared, is simply becoming another Bigg Market, which is tragic for one of the finest streets in the UK if not Europe.</p>
      <p>“It was a prestigious street with high class shopping, banks and other establishments, now it is fast becoming one large pub with a plethora of similar establishments nearby and I don’t believe there is sufficient demand for yet another large bar in this vicinity.</p>
      <p>“In fact, I believe the council should refuse all future applications for new licences on Grey Street.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police</a> are also objecting to the plans, saying that Grey Street already suffers from “noise, crime and disorder and anti-social behaviour”.</p>
      <p>But Mr Holland argued that The Muddler has been “incident-free” since opening last December.</p>
