      <h1>Maharashtra government formation: a tale with many twists</h1>
      <h2>Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the Chief Minister early on Saturday along with NCP leader Ajit Pawar as Deputy CM.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:40:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Harshita-Mishra-68634/" target="_blank">Harshita Mishra</a></address>
      <p>A month after the Maharashtra Assembly election results were announced on October 24, the political impasse in the State seems to have reached a climax, albeit with a stunning overnight twist. In less than twelve hours, the focus shifted from the NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena alliance that was all set to form a government, to the BJP, as Devendra Fadnavis took oath as the Chief Minister early on Saturday along with NCP leader Ajit Pawar as Deputy CM.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here’s what transpired in the month leading up to the event:</b>
      </p>
      <h3>October 24: Divided outcomes</h3>
      <p>Elections to the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly were held on October 21. Allies BJP and Shiv Sena emerge as the two largest parties in the results, but both parties see a dip in the number of seats won and their vote share. Meanwhile, the NCP and the Congress are net gainers, with 54 and 44 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>Although a BJP-Shiv Sena government with Mr. Fadnavis at the helm seems like a done deal, the Sena insists on a rotational chief ministership. The BJP, however, maintains that it does not intend to share the post.</p>
      <h3>October 25-29: the early signs of turmoil</h3>
      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray says <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Felections%2Fmaharashtra-assembly%2Ftalks-at-top-level-50-50-formula-shiv-sena-sets-the-terms-for-bjp%2Farticle29797514.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256410722&amp;sdata=V%2F5EO1Rt6ZnmsYxizxaupQXUMIxUCrc4NP%2FT3o%2BqL2o%3D&amp;reserved=0">he will only have discussions with BJP national president Amit Shah.</a></p>
      <p>Mr. Fadnavis denies acceding to the Sena’s demands. “I have confirmed with Amit Shah and he told me that the BJP has not given any assurance for the Chief Minister’s post for two-and-a-half years (each for the BJP and Sena),” he says.</p>
      <p>The two parties, in a bid to boost their numbers, enlist the support of MLAs from small outfits and independents.</p>
      <p>The Congress and the NCP stick to <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fnews%2Fcities%2Fmumbai%2Fncp-will-sit-in-opposition-nawab-malik%2Farticle29802556.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256420716&amp;sdata=xNt4AEGGIprRDXbVTmSe01c1AJRrD%2F%2B2yBqUncfvUqc%3D&amp;reserved=0">their Oppositional role</a>. “We are entering the new Assembly with not only increased strength but also renewed resolve to fight the anti-people policies of the government to the end,” says Nationalist Congress Party’s Mumbai unit president Nawab Malik. Ajit Pawar, NCP leader and nephew of Sharad Pawar, says <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Felections%2Fmaharashtra-assembly%2Fncp-congress-will-sit-in-opposition-in-maharashtra-says-ajit-pawar%2Farticle29852019.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256420716&amp;sdata=CPRmDWcdNxz5%2BuTFXRb%2B2i1FTIcMQqDtcOnSPQT%2FoyU%3D&amp;reserved=0">that his party and the Congress will remain in the Opposition.</a></p>
      <h3>October 30- November 2: unlikely alliance on the cards?</h3>
      <p>On October 30, former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan says the <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fother-states%2Fhow-can-bjp-sena-form-govt-amid-mutual-distrust-chavan%2Farticle29827222.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256430709&amp;sdata=83i8l%2Bu7cF3q2aNAq9SQSYvDkl%2BFoqMR2BHrPB2Jrec%3D&amp;reserved=0">Congress high command shall decide on a possible alliance </a>between the Congress and Shiv Sena: “These are ifs and buts… in case we do receive such a proposal from the Shiv Sena... To the best of my knowledge, no such proposal has come to us,” says the senior Congressman.</p>
      <p>Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fcongress-wants-ncp-to-rethink-on-maharashtra-govt-formation%2Farticle29835134.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256430709&amp;sdata=Tz03fvuWDyxNIWdp5FWzd011neNLUlyrO65onkdhNPQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">adds to the uncertainty.</a> “Maharashtra is an evolving situation and in such an evolving situation, Congress general secretary in-charge Mallikarjun Kharge and the leaders of the State will decide. It won’t be proper to comment on this any further,” he says.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fmaharashtra-impasse-shiv-senas-sanjay-raut-texts-ncps-ajit-pawar%2Farticle29870779.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256430709&amp;sdata=4s6B13gr3H5S9VjV%2BUcvP%2F69NITi3n8%2BjwfC%2FSCEaTY%3D&amp;reserved=0">Sanjay Raut says that he had a meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar</a>.

      <p>Mr. Pawar also met senior Congress leaders in the State on October 31. The leaders then visited Delhi to discuss the party’s stand if the Shiv Sena stakes claim to form the government. The Congress is yet to receive an official proposal from the Sena.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut also says that <a href="https://apc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehindu.com%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fother-states%2Fif-shiv-sena-wants-it-can-prove-majority-in-maharashtra-says-sanjay-raut%2Farticle29851145.ece&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cnetalert%40thehindu.co.in%7C931d05390a0e486a633808d77009ed56%7Cc8f171fb8e124c1286ff9108c97b8963%7C0%7C0%7C637101060256440709&amp;sdata=VpGXAlKkq4YK66JAYJaqqk%2FbrZb%2Fh6DYB3FJvB%2B8GNQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">the Shiv Sena can form a government on its own</a>, without formally mentioning a possible alliance between the Congress-NCP and Shiv Sena.</p>
