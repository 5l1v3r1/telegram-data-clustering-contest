      <h1>Mike Pence Makes Unannounced Visit to Iraq</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:15:43+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Alissa J. Rubin and Falih Hassan</a></address>
      <p>BAGHDAD — Vice President Mike Pence made an unexpected visit to Iraq on Saturday, arriving as protests aimed at toppling the Iraqi leadership and changing the political system <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/world/middleeast/iraq-corruption-protests.html?searchResultPosition=4&amp;module=inline">continued to roil the country.</a></p>
      <p>Mr. Pence made two stops: He landed with the permission of the Iraqi government at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq’s western desert, where many of the American troops are billeted while they train and assist the Iraqi forces fighting the remains of the Islamic State. He then flew to Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pence received a classified briefing at the air base, from which American Special Forces had launched the operation in Syria last month that led to the death of the Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</p>
      <p>He then spoke by phone with Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mehdi but did not meet with him, according to the Mr. Mehdi’s office. In a statement, his office said the two men “discussed the latest developments in Iraq and the Iraqi government efforts at reform in response to the demonstrators’ demands.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Pence told reporters that Mr. Mehdi promised “that they would work to protect and respect peaceful protesters as part of the democratic process.”</p>
      <p>In Erbil, Mr. Pence met with two powerful Kurdish politicians who are cousins: Nechirvan Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, and Masrour Barzani, the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pence denied that there was any tension with Iraqi or Syrian Kurds over Mr. Trump’s abrupt decision in October to withdraw American forces from northeast Syria, where Syrian Kurdish forces had been fighting the Islamic State alongside the Americans.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there was any confusion now among the leadership here in the Kurdish region of President Trump’s commitment to our allies here in Iraq as well as those in the Syrian Defense Forces, the Kurdish forces who fought alongside us. It’s unchanging,” Mr. Pence said.</p>
      <p>The sudden departure of the American troops in October left Syrian Kurdish civilians and forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-kurds-death.html?module=inline">vulnerable</a> to Turkish forces who entered their territory, taking ground and killing nearly 100 civilians and displacing 200,000, according to the United Nations.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pence’s trip came 11 months after President Trump made a similar, unannounced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-visit.html?module=inline">visit to Al Asad,</a> just days after announcing that he was pulling American troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. The change in policy caused a major shake-up in the White House defense and foreign policy team. Mr. Trump’s plans to meet with Mr. Mehdi were canceled.</p>
      <p>The timing of the trip by Mr. Pence — the second-most-senior member of the American government — was significant. It underscored the United States’ continued engagement in Iraq and was an implicit riposte to Iran, which has often tried to present itself to Iraqi leaders as a more consistent partner than the Americans.</p>
      <p>Iran has dispatched Gen. Qassim Soleimani, the leader of its Quds Force, the most elite arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, on multiple occasions to address difficult political situations. He was in Baghdad recently to help the Iraqis plot a response to the protests.</p>
      <p>Later Saturday, Mr. Pence and his wife, Karen, <a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1198262497352044544">served Thanksgiving lunch</a> to about 150 troops, and the vice president delivered remarks to about 200 troops, thanking them for their service. The United States has about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/world/middleeast/us-troops-deployments.html?module=inline">6,000 troops in Iraq.</a></p>
      <p>The visit occurred as Iraqi government leaders have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/world/middleeast/iraq-protests.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline">struggled to deal with street protests</a>, which have galvanized many in the south of the country as well as in the capital, Baghdad. On Saturday, Iraqi officials said one person had been shot dead and dozens of others wounded as protests continued in the capital.</p>
      <p>Iran, which sees the uprising in Iraq as a threat that has encouraged a similar if more limited movement at home, has advocated a tough response. The United States has lobbied against that approach, encouraging Iraq to work with the nonviolent protesters, but has taken the same view as Iran toward the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Both countries’ leadership believe that he should remain in power for the moment, because if he were swept away — as some protesters want — it could lead to a chaotic situation in which bloodshed or even a renewed civil war could occur.</p>
      <p>Unlike Iran, the United States wants to see reforms made in the Iraqi system to root out corruption and create an electoral system that is less dominated by sectarian apolitical parties that tend to divide up the spoils and do little to represent the people.</p>
      <p>Less than 24 hours before Mr. Pence’s arrival, a rocket was fired at Green Zone, the location of the United States Embassy.</p>
