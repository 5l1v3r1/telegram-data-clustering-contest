      <p>The Reds return to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> action at Selhurst Park looking to maintain their stranglehold atop of the table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s side are on the hunt for their 12th win in 13 games, and a further three points would place pressure on a <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> side who host <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a> in the late kickoff on Saturday – ensuring at least one team in the chasing pack is set to drop points.</p>
      <p>There are concerns over a number of Liverpool players, however, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> headlining the list of injuries ahead of the Reds’ trip to London, with a late decision expected to be made over the duo’s ability to feature.</p>
