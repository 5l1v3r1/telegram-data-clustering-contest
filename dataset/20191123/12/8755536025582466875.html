      <p>Kim Kardashian has revealed that she ‘cried all the way home’ after seeing cruel memes about her first Met Gala look.</p>
      <p>In a new video for Vogue, the 39-year-old reflected on some of her best and worst outfits to date – including that floral-print gown she wore to her first Met Gala back in 2013.</p>
      <p>Kim was pregnant with her first child, North, at the time and felt incredibly insecure because she felt like nobody wanted her there.</p>
      <p>Kim said: “I was very pregnant, very puffy and bloated and I was like, ‘Oh god, of course the first time I go I’m gonna be huge.”</p>

      <p>“Kanye was performing so I wasn’t actually invited, I was just Kanye’s plus one. And that was okay with me because I never really dreamed I would be at the Met Ball. I know no one really probably wanted me there at the time.”</p>
      <p>Kim’s dress was designed by then-Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci, and she actually wanted to wear a black version of the dress – but was convinced otherwise.</p>
      <p>“We chose a really stretchy fabric because I would be growing and we wanted to make sure that alterations were easy and it was comfortable,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was like, ‘I think I should just do the black version,’ and Riccardo was like, ‘No, c’mon, we have to do the floral.'”</p>

      <p>“But I was so insecure. I could never really speak up at that point because I so shy and just wanted to make everybody happy,” she recalled.</p>
      <p>After Kim and Kanye walked the red carpet, people quickly started criticising her outfit, and compared her dress to an old floral couch or curtains.</p>
      <p>Kim said: “And then, I was crying like the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it, there was all these memes about me and this couch, and I think Robin Williams even tweeted it, said I looked like Mrs. Doubtfire, it was this whole thing.”</p>

      <p>Although she cried at the time, Kim looks back and loves the dress now, and said she felt ok about it because the Olsen twins approved.</p>
      <p>She said: “I just remember the Olsen twins came up to me and loved my outfit and my gloves, so none of the critics mattered because the Olsen twins approved.”</p>
