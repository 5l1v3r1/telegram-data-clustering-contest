      <p>While Ernst Middendorp says that he’s not yet ready to start for Kaizer Chiefs again, the club have revealed that he is ‘medically fit’ following the groin injury that he sustained in September.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Amakhosi shot-stopper hasn’t played since having to come off against Baroka earlier in the season, and has battled for fitness for almost a year now having also gone for shoulder surgery around in late December 2018.</p>
      <p>There had been some hope that, with the international break giving him time to recover further, Khune may be able to return in time to replace the suspended Daniel Akpeyi for tomorrow’s Telkom Knockout semifinal, but Middendorp told the media that it will be Bruce Bvuma who starts between the sticks.</p>
      <p>It seems the 32-year-old is nearing his Amakhosi comeback though after he re-joined the first team in full training recently, and he’ll be eager to stake his claim for a starting berth before the year is out.</p>
      <p>A statement on the club’s official website read, “Ahead of their trip to Nelspruit for the Telkom Knockout Cup on the weekend, Itumeleng Khune is medically fit and has joined the team in full training. Khune has been recovering from a groin injury he picked up in the game against Baroka FC in September.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bvuma is set to start v Maritzburg United at 15h00, with Brylon Petersen on the bench, but Middendorp also has other decisions to make given suspensions for Willard Katsande and Erick Mathoho.</p>
