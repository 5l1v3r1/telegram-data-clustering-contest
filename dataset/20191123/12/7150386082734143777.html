      <h3>Dream11 Tips And Predictions</h3>
      <p>Dream11 Team Prediction Bengaluru FC vs Kerala Blasters FC ISL 2019-20 – Football Tips For Today’s Match No. 21 BFC vs KBFC in Bengaluru: The Indian Super League returns after the international break and there is a big-ticket clash between Bengaluru FC and Kerala Blasters FC to look forward to on Saturday. The South Indian rivals will look to make the most of a charged atmosphere in front of expectant supporters at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Saturday and breathe life into their campaigns. Bengaluru and Kerala find themselves in the middle of the pack with the hosts in the fifth position with six points from four games, while the Kochi-based side are seventh with four points. Though Bengaluru are one of only three sides to remain undefeated in the ISL so far, they have only one win to their name. It came against another arch-rival, Chennaiyin FC, just before the international break.</p>
      <p>More importantly, Carles Cuadrat’s side found their scoring boots as they pumped three goals past Chennaiyin after managing only one in their first three matches. Captain Sunil Chhetri also opened his account for the season in that game. Once again, the likes of Erik Paartalu and Raphael Augusto will be key with the former’s return from injury proving a huge shot in the arm for Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>Kerala, after their opening day win against ATK, have struggled and are winless in three games. The ATK game preceded defeats against Mumbai City and Hyderabad FC which was followed by a stalemate against Odisha FC at home. Injuries to key personnel like Mario Arques, Raphael Messi Bouli and Jairo Rodrigues have not helped their cause. The match between Bengaluru FC and Kerala Blasters FC will kick-off at 7.30 PM IST on Saturday (November 23). The game will be shown live on Star Sports Network, while the live streaming is available via HotStar and Jio TV.</p>
