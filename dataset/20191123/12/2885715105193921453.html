      <p>As actor Kangana Ranaut’s first look for her upcoming biopic movie Thalaivi was revealed, netizens took to social media to express their disappointment. The movie is based on former Tamil Nadu chief minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jayalalithaa">Jayalalithaa</a>’s life.</p>
      <p>“The legend we know, but the story that is yet to be told!” read the tweet by Ranaut’s Twitter account handled by her digital media team. Along with the tweet was the first look of Ranaut as Jayalalithaa.</p>
      <p>However, the reaction to Ranaut’s look was quite contrary to what the directors probably expected them to be as many compared the look to a “Wax statue”.</p>

      <p>Expected to be released on June 26, 2020, the first look teaser also triggered hilarious reactions online. “What’s with the anatomy guys? And what’s with the face moving like a mannequin?” wrote a user while sharing the first look.</p>
