      <p>Cheryl and her Girls Aloud pals have slammed reports they have a group chat against former bandmate Nadine Coyle while she's on I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Rumours suggested that Geordie star <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cheryl">Cheryl</a> and fellow <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/girls-aloud">Girls Aloud</a> stars and friends Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts have a What's App group where they plot to get Nadine to do all the bushtucker trials in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The trio are so incensed with the reports that they have all issued statements in support of the Irish singer, who <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/im-a-celebrity-nadine-cheryl-17281410">Cheryl famously clashed with after Nadine</a> blamed her ex-bandmates for Girls Aloud's split after their greatest hits tour in 2013.</p>
      <p>Cheryl rubbished Nadine's claims and said it was her, rather than the rest of the Popstars: The Rivals winning group, who'd made life difficult.</p>
      <p>But now Cheryl, Kimberley and Nicola have all come out in support of Nadine, in statements given to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7716349/Cheryl-Kimberley-Walsh-Nicola-Roberts-SLAM-claims-group-chat-slating-Nadine-Coyle.html">Mail Online.</a></p>
      <p>In hers, Cheryl said "We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.</p>
      <p>"We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!'"</p>
      <p>Also dismissing the speculation, Kimberley said "'I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there," and echoing those sentiments Nicola added "We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity, this just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show.'</p>
      <p>All four girls, along with bandmate Sarah Harding, shot to fame after earning a place in Girls Aloud on Popstars: The Rivals at the end of 2002.</p>
      <p>After the group was formed they swiftly shot to number 1 with their debut single Sound of the Underground, easily seeing off competition from winning boyband One True Voice.</p>
      <p>Countless hit albums, tours and singles followed including number1s like I'll Stand By You and The Promise.</p>
