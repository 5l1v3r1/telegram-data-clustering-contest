      <p>Last night Joe Schmidt sat down with Ryan Tubridy for Friday's airing of The Late Late Show. The New Zealander was visibly delighted when the Late Late host brought out a special guest.</p>
      <p>In particular, Schmidt discussed sport and in his time with Ireland in the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>After Ireland's disappointing defeat to Japan, the Kiwi admitted he was quite nervous returning to the Emerald Isle and he feared what the public would think.</p>
      <p>Schmidt's leadership over the Irish rugby team ended in a crushing fashion but overall, he was a huge success and will go down as a legend of Irish rugby.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the nerves, Schmidt told Ryan:</p>
      <p>"I was disappointed. I didn't really want to meet people and have them disappointed as well.</p>
      <p>"You know when you get off the flight you're going to walk straight into cameras that are at the airport. We'd been up at 3am to catch our flight and I didn't really catch our flight.</p>
      <p>"You get in - and I'm not sure what I said in the interview now - but you're probably not at your peak.</p>
      <p>"I did hide away for a while. And my wife said let's get out of town then. We went to Spain for a few days which was great."</p>
      <p>As the conversation was coming to a close, Ryan said "I just don't feel like finishing this just yet."</p>
      <p>A special guest then popped up out of the blue, much to the delight of Joe Schmidt. The guest was none other than the man himself Brian O'Driscoll.</p>
      <p>The sports legend praised the impact Schmidt has had on Irish rugby over his career and presented the former Ireland coach with a signed copy of Seamus Heaney's poetry as a farewell gift.</p>
