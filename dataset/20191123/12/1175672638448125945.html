      <h1>House installed inside MAAT gallery to draw parallels between queerness and incarceration</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:00:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/amy-frearson/" target="_blank">Amy Frearson</a></address>
      <p>Portuguese artists João Pedro Vale and Nuno Alexandre Ferreira have erected a two-storey building inside the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/maat/">MAAT</a> in Lisbon, filled with references to "dissident forms of sexuality".</p>
      <p>Visitors are invited to enter the dark, mysterious structure, where they find a two-storey interior containing what looks like the cells and wash room of a prison, but which is also reminiscent of gay cruising venues.</p>

      <p>Titled <a href="https://www.maat.pt/en/exhibitions/joao-pedro-vale-nuno-alexandre-ferreira-loving-road-begins">Loving as the Road Begins</a>, the installation draws comparisons between the constructs of imprisonment and the realities of queer existence.</p>
      <p>"The artists juxtapose a variety of opposing references which conjure up images of impurity and sanitation, illness and cure, crime and punishment, associating incarceration structures with forbidden existences," reads an exhibition overview.</p>

      <p>The project developed through <a href="http://joaopedrovale.com/">Vale and Ferreira</a>'s research into the late surrealist poet and painter Mário Cesariny.</p>
      <p>During a residency at La Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris, the pair stayed in an apartment close to the monument, Saint-Jacques Tower. They recognised it as the cover image of Cesariny's book, A Cidade Queimada, or Burnt City.</p>

      <p>Cesariny wrote the book in 1964, during a two-month incarceration at Fresnes prison, where he was sent after being arrested for soliciting a police officer in a Paris cinema and accused of gross indecency.</p>
      <p>The poet's imprisonment is believed by many to have been persecution, as a result of his so-called vagrancy – a derogatory term used at the time to describe homosexuals. So Vale and Ferreira felt it would make sense to take a close look at this time in his life.</p>

      <p>Given Cesariny's obsession with the gothic tower and its garden, the pair designed the installation to look like a building found in the grounds.</p>

      <p>They imagined that this simple structure, containing a ground floor and a basement, might have served as a living space or rest area for the garden watchman, or as a store room for tools. It also contained public toilets – a type of space often used in gay cruising.</p>

      <p>At the <a href="https://www.maat.pt/en">MAAT</a>, this building is recreated as a two-storey structure, accessed via a staircase that leads up to the first floor.</p>
      <p>Inside are dark-painted spaces, dimly lit by red and white neon lights. Walls are covered in graffiti, and sections of the space are partitioned off into cells.</p>

      <p>One space contains latrines, while another contains showers. There is also a dressing table covered in bottles and an old radio.</p>
      <p>Downstairs, water from the showers above drips down through the gridded metal ceiling, into a large pool. Posed poster images of naked men cover the wall, forming part of the graffiti artwork.</p>

      <p>The exhibition was curated by Inês Grosso. It is not the first to shine a light on the physical spaces of gay cruising.</p>
      <p>The Cruising Pavilion – previously <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/05/30/cruising-pavilion-venice-architecture-biennale-2018-casual/">shown in Venice</a> and now <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/11/04/architecture-overdue-sexual-revolution-cruising-pavilion-ark-des/">exhibiting in Stockholm</a> – also highlights the role that sex plays in architecture and interiors.</p>
      <p>Loving as the Road Begins is on show at MAAT until 20 April 2020.</p>
