      <h1>Tokyo here we come! Happy ending for the SA U-23s in Egypt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:50:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:50</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Mothowagae</a></address>
      <p>The SA Under-23s grabbed the final Olympic ticket on offer at the CAF U-23 Afcon in Egypt following a dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Ghana in their third-place play-off on Friday.</p>
      <p>The 6-5 victory on penalties after a 2-2 stalemate handed the young Bafana the bronze medal. They joined Egypt and Ivory Coast as Africa’s three representatives in the Olympic football tournament in Tokyo, Japan next year.</p>
      <p>Ghana came back twice in the game to force the match into penalties but South Africa’s goalkeeper Mondli Mpoto was the hero after stopping two spot-kicks before a packed Cairo International Stadium.</p>
      <p>Captain Tercious Malepe (missed) and Katleho Mohamme (saved) were unsuccessful during the shoot-out but all of Grant Margeman, Thendo Mukumela, Luther Singh, Athenkosi Dladla, Kobamelo Kodisang and Lyle Foster converted.</p>

      <p>South Africa seemed destined for glory from the onset as they led twice before defensive blunders brought Ghana back in it.</p>
      <p>Coach David Notoane’s side broke the deadlock courtesy of a 16th-minute own goal by Habib Mohammed, who deflected Singh’s cross-cum-shot from a tight angle.</p>
      <p>However, Ghana were back on level terms just after the break when Evans Mensah’s fired a scorcher from outside the box past Mpoto.</p>
      <p>Poor defending saw Samuel Obeng scramble home for another Ghana come back with less than 10 minutes to go. The young Black Stars’ joy was short-lived when Kamohelo Mahlatsi, who two minutes after coming on as a substitute, netted after the hour-mark. This after the Ghanian defence failed to clear their lines.</p>
      <p>The strike, with the help of Foster who was involved in the build-up to the goal, confirmed South Africa’s place at the Olympics alongside Egypt and the Ivorians, who earned an automatic pass to Asia by virtue of being the finalists.</p>
      <p>Notoane and his heroic team are expected home round lunchtime on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, six countries, including hosts Japan, have already earned their places in Tokyo next year.</p>
      <p>More continental championships are still to be concluded early next year to complete the 16-nation line up at the multi-coded Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Fifa, in collaboration with affiliate football federations, determined the slots allocated to each continent.</p>
      <p>This is the race to Tokyo so far:</p>
      <p>Asia – With the exception of Japan, two more Asian nations will qualify during their continental championships in January.</p>
      <p>Europe – Spain, Germany, Romania and France earned their berths during the Uefa European Under-21 Championship in Italy mid-year.</p>
      <p>North, Central America and Caribbean – Eight teams will compete for two places on offer at the final qualifying tournament in Guadalajara, Mexico in March-April next year.</p>
      <p>Oceania – New Zealand grabbed their ticket to Tokyo during their continental tournament held between September and last month in Fiji.</p>
      <p>South America – Colombia will host the region’s qualifying tournament between January and February next year. The top two teams will qualify</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The men’s Olympic football tournament will run from July 23 to August 8 in the Japanese capital.</li>
