      <h1>Starting XI: Leganes v Barca</h1>

      <p>FC Barcelona will be out to claim another big win in LaLiga when they visit struggling Leganes this afternoon - Here's how the champions will line-up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LaLiga</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Leganes v FC Barcelona</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 23 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Estadio Municipal de Butarque</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants entered the international break top of the pile following a 4-1 victory over Celta Vigo at the Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>However, Barca's last league encounter on the road ended in a disappointment after losing 3-1 to Levante at the start of November.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde's men will, however, come up against Leganes, who have only won one of their 13 league encounters this season.</p>
      <p>As a result, Levante find themselves rooted to the foot of the standings but could jump up to 18th spot with three points this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Both sides have suspensions to deal with as Sergi Roberto misses out for Barca, while Kevin Rodrigues and Marc Navarro are unavailable for the home side.</p>
      <p>Despite Leganes' struggles this season, they can take confidence from the fact that they defeated Barcelona in this fixture last season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Leganes: </b>Cuellar; Rosales, Bustinza, Siovas, Omeruo, Silva; Oscar, Ruben Perez, Roque Mesa; En Nesyri, Braithwaite.</p>
      <p><b>FC Barcelona:  </b>Ter Stegen, Wagué, Piqué, Umtiti, Junior, Busquets, De Jong, Dembélé, Griezmann, Messi, Suárez<b>.</b></p>
