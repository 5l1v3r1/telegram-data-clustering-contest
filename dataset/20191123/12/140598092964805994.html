      <h1>EuroMillions winner claims £105m jackpot prize</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:20:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>A claim has been staked for the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/11/23/national-lottery-making-feel-good-losing-money-25-years/">£105 million EuroMilliions jackpot won on Tuesday.</a></p>
      <p>It is not known whether the UK ticket-holder is an individual or a syndicate.</p>
      <p>National Lottery operator Camelot said the prize will be paid out at a ticket validation appointment before the winner decides whether to go public.</p>
      <p>The big prize on the 25th anniversary of the first National Lottery draw was the sixth EuroMillions jackpot banked in the UK this year.</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at the National Lottery, said: "What a way to celebrate 25 years of the National Lottery.</p>
      <p>"This is the sixth massive EuroMillions jackpot win in 2019 and follows the nation's biggest ever win of £170 million just last month.</p>
      <p>"We now focus on supporting the ticket-holder as they start to enjoy their newfound wealth.</p>
      <p>"There is another chance to win big tonight with a £25 million must-be-won Lotto jackpot up for grabs. Make sure you have a ticket to be in with a chance to win big."</p>
      <p>A UK ticket-holder won the £170 million EuroMillions jackpot in October, making them the UK's biggest winner.</p>
      <p>The previous biggest UK winners were Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, who won £161 million in July 2011.</p>
      <p>A £123 million jackpot was won by a UK ticket-holder in June and a UK winner scooped £38 million on the EuroMillions in April.</p>
      <p>Ade Goodchild, from Hereford, bagged £71 million on March 15 and Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won £114.9 million on New Year's Day.</p>
