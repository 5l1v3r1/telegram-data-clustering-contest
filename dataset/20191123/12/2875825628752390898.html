      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> is “seeing <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/drake">Drake</a> just to make her ex Travis Scott jealous” a source has said in a bombshell claim.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a> star and rapper hunk Drake sparked rumours that they're dating after they started spending more time together recently.</p>
      <p>Reports of their suspected blossoming romance had also reportedly upset Travis.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/">Hollywood Life</a> claimed Travis would "feel betrayed" if Kylie and Drake's relationship actually became something more romantic.</p>

      <p>It was then claimed that Drake dumped her because he is more of a "free spirit" and didn't want to be tied down.</p>
      <p>But in a shocking twist, a source has claimed Kylie’s budding courtship with the God’s Plan artist is continuing "occasionally" and is actually all a ploy to make her baby Stormi’s dad jealous.</p>
      <p>“Kylie doesn’t seem to be dating,” a source told <a href="https://people.com/">PEOPLE</a> . “She sees Drake occasionally, but it doesn’t seem serious.</p>
      <p>“She could be doing it just to make Travis jealous.”</p>
      <p>Kylie, who split from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/travis-scott">Travis Scott</a> at the beginning of October, and the Canadian rapper were first linked in late October when the beauty mogul went to his 33rd birthday party.</p>

      <p>Drake has known the Kardashian-Jenner Klan for years and even performed at Kylie's 16th birthday party.</p>
      <p>Rumours of them being a couple first ignited when Kylie recently attended the pop icon's birthday bash in Hollywood and it was reported that the pair "had an attraction".</p>
      <p>Although some sources attempted to shut down rumours and insisted to the publication that Kylie and Drake's relationship is just "friendly", another insider told People the pair have been hanging out "romantically".</p>

      <p>One report suggested that they got involved months ago and decided to keep it under the radar because of Drake's previous feud with her brother-in-law <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> .</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> claimed Kylie "wanted to keep the news from her sister <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> who is married to West.</p>
      <p>However, there's no suggestion that there was any overlap with Kylie's ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, the father of her daughter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stormi-webster">Stormi</a> , who she split from this year.</p>
      <p>Last month Kylie confirmed she'd split from Travis on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , writing: "Travis and I are on great terms. Our main focus right now is Stormi. Our friendship and our daughter is priority."</p>
      <p>The former couple, who were together for three years, are said to be spending a lot of time together.</p>
      <p>A source told People : "It was important for her to support Travis’ festival.</p>
      <p>"They are still very close and often hang out with Stormi."</p>
