      <p>Premier John Horgan said his New Democratic Party’s convention isn’t the place to negotiate with teachers, many of whom made their presence known outside the meeting Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The B.C. Teachers’ Federation picked a meeting room at The Empress Hotel for its representative assembly, a few metres away from where more than 600 New Democrats met at the Victoria Convention Centre.</p>
      <p>Dozens of teachers wearing #RedforBCEd T-shirts rallied at the entrance greeting party delegates as they went in. Their union has been negotiating with the bargaining agency for government and school districts for months, so far unsuccessfully.</p>
      <p>Horgan told NDP members his government has made record investments in education, a billion dollars since taking power in 2017.</p>
      <p>“For years and years teachers fought the B.C. Liberals in court, to get back a collective agreement that was signed with New Democrats in the 1990s.”</p>
      <p>He said class size and composition — currently among the issues unresolved —  was put up for negotiation by the previous NDP  government. After the Liberal government eliminated that, he said “for 16 years the federation fought to get those rights restored and by God we were right beside them.”</p>
      <p>There are challenges now at the bargaining table, he said. “But here’s the difference: we believe in free collective bargaining.”</p>
      <p>He told the party that the negotiating has to be done at the bargaining table, “not at the convention, not in question period not on the evening new.”</p>
      <p>The class size and composition issues are “critically important,” he said.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact the powerful union of 46,000 members is now in an adversarial position with his government, Horgan said he believes they support many of his government’s initiatives.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a dispute about values.”</p>
      <p>He stressed the NDP’s commitment to helping people in an hour-long accounting of accomplishments and scorned the previous B.C.  Liberal government’s record.</p>
      <p>“B.C. Liberals thought it was okay for the economy to be run by organized crime. We believe the economy should be run for the people of B.C., the people in this room.”</p>
      <p>He promised continued work on climate change initiatives, saying: “If you’re arguing with a 16-year-old about a future that she wants to see, you’re on the wrong side of history.”<br/> </p>
