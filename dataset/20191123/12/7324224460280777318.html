      <p>Meanwhile debris was left scattered across the junction and the BMW ended up 20 metres away with its front end resting against the Classic Furniture shop.</p>
      <p>Tajinder Kaur, the manager of Classic Furniture, said the store was still open and trading despite the damage to the outside of the building.</p>
      <p>He said: "The damage is what it is and we'll get it looked at. We just wanted to make sure that the people involved are ok after the accident."</p>
      <p>The road was closed throughout the morning as collision investigators examined the scene, with the 25, 79 and 82 National Express buses being diverted as a result.</p>
      <p>The damaged cars were recovered at around 1pm, clearing the way for the roads to be reopened.</p>
