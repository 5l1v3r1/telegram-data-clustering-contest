      <h1>Jose Mourinho speaks out on Christian Eriksen's Tottenham future after first game omission</h1>
      <h2>The Dane was left on the bench for Mourinho's first game in charge against West Ham on Saturday, and has been strongly linked with a Tottenham exit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T12:04:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 12:04</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho says he "needs to understand" Christian Eriksen after omitting him from his first ever <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur lineup.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese left the playmaker out of the XI he named for the trip to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> , naming Lucas Moura in his side as he made three changes from Mauricio Pochettino's final selection in the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United before the international break.</p>
      <p>"I need to understand what is in Christian's mind or heart and we have to make the right decision for the club," Mourinho told BT Sport before the clash.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss then went on to explain what he expects from the clash at the London Stadium.</p>

      <p>"I think today is about a bit of everything," he said.</p>
      <p>"Motivation - I think they always had it. People think when results are bad it's about motivation but they are professionals and they always try their best. Tactics - we have just a few little changes but I have not changed a lot just little things I think will help.</p>
      <p>"Today is important but our future is also very important. We are going to try and find some positions and dynamic which we have had chance to work with Kane, Son and Moura. Today is about finding happiness."</p>

      <p>Hammers boss Manuel Pellegrini was keen to play down the rivalry with his opposite number.</p>
      <p>"I don’t have any problems with Jose – he is a special man – he named it himself," he told BT Sport.</p>

      <p>"He is a good manager, he does well in the Premier League. I feel sad for Mauricio Pochettino he has done so much for the club. I wish Jose a lot of success but after this game."</p>
      <p>"First of all we are concentrating on defending. We have conceded six goals and five of them were from set pieces. We need to work on that."</p>
