      <p>A British expat who died instantly after being shot in the heart at a Costa del Sol holiday resort has been named.</p>
      <p>Peter Andrew Williamson, 39, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was gunned down on Thursday as he sat in his parked car outside his luxury villa.</p>
      <p>It is thought he was shot from another vehicle which drew up beside him and sped away from the scene.</p>
      <p>Friends and relatives have paid tribute to Mr Williamson, nicknamed Snaggle, who is believed to have two children.</p>
      <p>Writing on social media his aunt Carol Williamson said: ‘My caring beautiful nephew little Peter.</p>

      <p>Mr Williamson had just returned from the gym and was sitting in his UK-plated two-seater Audi when he was killed at around 3.15pm.</p>
      <p>He was outside his home in the hills on the north side of the AP-7 motorway, running along the Costa del Sol.</p>
      <p>A notice in Spanish at the front gate of the large detached villa says: ‘CCTV operating in this area. You may be being recorded.’</p>

      <p>Business records show the victim was registered as a self-employed agricultural sector intermediary specialising in ‘international trade’.</p>
      <p>Detectives are looking into the theory that the British expat’s murder was drugs related and said he had been arrested in March for using a transport firm to send cannabis resin from Malaga to an unidentified destination, according to local paper Diario Sur.</p>
      <p>There has been no official comment from Costa del Sol police about the reports and officers have confirmed no arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>Mr Williamson’s murder was the area’s second in less than a week.</p>

      <p>On Friday last week, a man was shot dead on a residential estate called Andasol, a short drive from Marbella town centre and close to a beach named Alvarito Playa.</p>
      <p>Detectives believe the killer fled in a getaway car and have not made any official comment on the victims’ nationalities, but local reports at the time said they were of ‘Arabic origin’.</p>
      <p>The incident is being linked to a gangland drugs feud.</p>

      <p>In January a millionaire businessman who was close to the stars of reality TV series TOWIE was shot dead outside his luxury Costa del Sol home.</p>
      <p>Marco Yaqout, who parties with the likes of Mohamed Al Fayed , was gunned down as he drove his garage in his trademark UK-plated Bentley.</p>
      <p>The killer was waiting outside his villa on a quiet residential street in an upmarket neighbourhood in San Pedro de Alcantara near Marbella.</p>

      <p>At the time of his murder, the English-speaking entrepreneur was said to own at least five well known nightspots in Puerto Banus, including Linekers and TOWIE favourite TIBU.</p>
      <p>Other violent incidents in recent months on the Costa del Sol include two attacks on Brits, the shooting of a Dutchman in a sushi restaurant and the machine-gun murder of a Frenchman outside his home.</p>
      <p>Last September a 24-year-old Brit was stabbed twice in the legs by an assailant who attacked him in the street without warning in the popular resort of Puerto Banus.</p>
      <p>It came ten days after a 35-year-old Brit was shot, stabbed, beaten and given a ‘Glasgow smile’ close to the same area after being abducted by a gang of criminals over a drug deal.</p>
      <p>The torture victim was later identified as Craig Moran, jailed for 13 years for his part in a September 2003 armed raid on a jeweller’s in Nottingham in which shop owner Marian Bates was killed.</p>
