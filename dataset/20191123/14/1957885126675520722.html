      <p>Epic Games has followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-21-xbox-black-friday-sale-slashes-50-percent-off-some-of-2019s-best-games">Xbox Black Friday sale</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-23-playstation-store-black-friday-sale-reduces-spider-man-borderlands-3-and-loads-more">PlayStation Black Friday sale</a> by slashing the prices of many games on the Epic Games Store for its own <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/collection/november-2019-sale">Black Friday sale</a>. It's that time of the year, after all.</p>
      <p>From now until Cyber Monday, 2nd December, you'll be able to pick up a whole range of excellent titles at discounted prices. One of the more noteworthy deals is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-10-25-red-dead-redemption-2-review_9">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, which is currently available for £43.99. Only released on PC over a fortnight ago, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-06-rockstar-scrambles-to-patch-launcher-after-red-dead-redemption-2-pc-woes">Rockstar Games' cowboy adventure suffered a bit of a shaky launch</a>, but after some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-13-rockstar-apologises-for-red-dead-redemption-2s-wobbly-pc-launch-more-fixes-out-today">TLC from the developer</a>, the game is finally getting to a state PC players can enjoy.</p>

      <p>As well as RDR2, you can grab Gearbox's recently-released loot shooter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-19-borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Borderlands 3</a>, for £33.49; that's less than you'll pay for the game on either the Xbox Store or PlayStation Store at the minute. Despite gags that grate, Borderlands 3 features some of the series' best gunplay and visuals. So, if you're interested, now's probably a good time to jump in.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-22-the-outer-worlds-review-an-inward-looking-genre-piece-that-never-stretches-the-imagination">The Outer Worlds</a> has gone down in price, too, making it £37.49 for the next week and a bit. Some have felt apathetic about the whole thing, whilst others have been going wild for The Outer Worlds' Fallout-y charm; if you want to see what it's like for yourself, then you'd best grab it on the Epic Games Store while it's on offer.</p>
      <p>If none of those interest you, there's plenty of other deals that might tickle your fancy, like over a fiver off the superb <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-09-27-apple-arcade-what-the-golf-is-pure-comedy">What The Golf?</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-10-07-tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-review-a-limp-and-lifeless-spin-on-the-ubisoft-formula">Ghost Recon Breakpoint</a> at half price. There's something for everyone here, to be fair. Here's a few that caught our eye in particular.</p>
