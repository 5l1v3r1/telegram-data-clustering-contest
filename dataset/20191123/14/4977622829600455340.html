      <p>Taking the next big step towards implementing complete prohibition in the state, the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSR Congress government in Andhra Pradesh yesterday (22 November) ordered the cancellation of all current bare licenses in the state, <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/jagan-govt-cancels-licences-of-all-bars-with-immediate-effect-announces-new-policy-for-next-2-years-2396835.html">reports </a><i>News18</i>.</p>
      <p>As part of a new bar policy that will be put in place in the next two years, the state government will institute a lottery system for licenses to be given to new bars at the fees of Rs 10 lakh. The number of such licenses which will be issued has been set at 479.</p>
      <p>Licenses for micro beverages and three-start hotels will cost Rs 1.5 crore. Timings for bars have also been changed, and with effect from 1 January 2020, bars will only be allowed to operate from 11 am to 10 pm.</p>
      <p>The cancellation of all bar licenses follows the recent announcement by Reddy that his government would reduce the total number of bars in the state by 40 per cent.</p>
