      <h1>Why it is a woman's job to babysit a husband?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:03:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Kristine Ziwica</a></address>
      <p>When I was 12 years old, the local council offered a babysitting course. Keen to earn a bit of extra cash, I signed up. Six weeks later I received a certificate indicating I was skilled at basic first aid, could change a nappy, read the odd bedtime story and generally ensure the house didn’t catch on fire while the parents were out – and if it did, I knew how to call the fire department.</p>
      <p>What I don’t recall is receiving any advice on how to babysit grown men, more specifically my future husband. Perhaps that’s because that would never be my job.</p>

      <p>Imagine my surprise, then, to read British commentator Toby Young (famous for his stint at <i>Vanity Fair</i> in New York in the early naughties) suggesting that it should be.</p>
      <p>“What the Duke of York should have done is marry a tough, sensible, no-nonsense woman who would have stopped him getting into these messes — like I did,” Mr. Young wrote in <i>The Spectator.</i></p>
      <p>Mr Young said that upon hearing he was inclined to go on breakfast TV to defend Prince Andrew, his wife said: “Are you (expletive) insane … It’s as if alienating 99 per cent of the country isn’t enough for you. You have to hunt down the last one percent and make sure you piss them off, too.”</p>
      <p>Um, yes Toby, she has a point. But can I politely suggest that you should have considered that advice before using your platform to pen a column blaming women, yet again, for men’s abuse. It is a sure-fire way to lose female friends and alienate women, that’s roughly 50 percent of the population.</p>
      <p>It is not your wife’s job to “save your bacon” as you put it, and perhaps it’s time you grow up and take a bit of personal responsibility and learn to look after yourself.</p>
      <p>But this isn’t just about Toby Young and the dynamics of his marriage. It about the question why is everything apparently always women’s fault?</p>
      <p>If we look at the home front, a recent piece in the <i>New York Times</i> asked, "Why women, but not men, are judged for a messy house". The article highlighted research showing women are held to a higher social standard regarding house and home. In effect, they know they will be judged harshly and blamed if the house is messy, if the children are slovenly, if the wheels come off at home.</p>
      <p>Men know they will get a free pass, the research suggested, and therefore give less of a toss. And that, my friends – not the mythical “maternal gatekeeping” (the phenomenon in which controlling women supposedly won’t “let” a willing army of men do their bit), is why studies show women end up doing more of the housework.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Australian writer and woman’s advocate Catherine Fox has penned a whole book, <i>Stop Fixing Women</i> about the myriad of ways women are blamed for the inequality they experience at work, and the false notion we can promote equality by focusing exclusively on initiatives to “fix women” instead of tackling the structures that underpin their inequality.</p>
      <p>Women not being paid equally? Well then, they just don’t ask – like the blokes. Women not reaching the C-suite? Why aren’t they more confident – like the men. I could, and Fox does (very persuasively I might add) go on.</p>

      <p>In our culture, and countries around the world, a cursory glance at the headlines yields far too many examples of how women are blamed for men’s violence, even those who pay the ultimate price with their lives. Why didn’t she leave, we hear? What was she wearing, too many ask? Did she have a drink, some say? According to a report by ANROWS and Our Watch, nearly one in five media reports of violence against women includes so called “victim blaming”.</p>
      <p>But back to Toby and the notion that women are somehow responsible for their husbands.</p>
      <p>When my very well meaning mother-in-law asks me about my husband’s health and expresses concern about his diet and exercise (my husband’s father died of heart failure very young and it is a legitimate concern, given the family history) I point her in his direction and tell her to take it up with him. He is an adult who appreciates all too well how important his own health is and it’s not my job to tell him.</p>
      <p>And to use Mr Young’s phrasing, he knows he married “a tough, sensible, no nonsense woman” who knows it’s not her job to keep him out of trouble. That’s maybe why I married him.</p>
