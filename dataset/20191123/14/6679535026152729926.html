      <p>The Dharwad circle of the Archaeological Survey of India provided an opportunity for students on Friday to learn lessons from ancient structural engineering.</p>
      <p>As part of the World Heritage Week, being observed from November 19 to 25, ASI, Dharwad circle, had organised a programme on the premises of the Chandramouleshwar Temple at Unakal in Hubballi. The temple is a centrally protected monument, which dates back to the Chalukya era.</p>
      <p>The ASI had organised a workshop on the documentation of historical monuments on the temple premises to give a first-hand experience to the students on the techniques of ancient structural engineering.</p>
      <p>A 41-member team of students from School of Architecture of KLE Technological University, Hubballi, led by the department head Vinaya Hiremath, took part in the workshop.</p>
      <p>The ASI officials threw light on the ancient engineering techniques and helped the students get practical experience on the documentation work of ancient monuments.</p>
      <p>Interacting with the students, they elaborated on how important structural engineering was with reference to ancient architecture. They also englightened the students on the conservation and documentation practised by ASI.</p>
