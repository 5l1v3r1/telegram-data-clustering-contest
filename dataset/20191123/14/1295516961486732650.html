      <h1>Deadpool's Tim Miller Left Due to Control Struggles With Ryan Reynolds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:11:46+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Evangelia Galanis</a></address>
      <p>Recently, <i>Deadpool </i>director, Tim Miller, sat down to talk about his experience directing <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/terminator-6/"><i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i></a>. Despite arguing with James Cameron and other creatives over choices on the film, Miller knew he was the one with the final say. For <i>Deadpool</i>, however, this was apparently not the case.</p>
      <p>Miller told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/heat-vision/why-terminator-dark-fate-director-wont-work-james-cameron-again-1257322">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that a big reason why he left <i>Deadpool 2 </i>was the man behind the Merc himself, Ryan Reynolds. "It became clear that Ryan wanted to be in control of the franchise. You can work that way as a director, quite successfully, but I can't," Miller said.</p>

      <p>Ryan Reynolds was very involved with the project from the start, pushing the studio to make the <i>Deadpool </i>movie happen. Under Tim Miller's direction, the film became a critical and financial success. <i>Deadpool </i>earned over $782 million against a small budget of $58 million. The movie also became the ninth-highest grossing film of 2016.</p>
      <p>Despite <i>Deadpool</i>'s success, Miller did not return for the 2018 sequel. Instead, David Leitch helmed the project. Miller's original script for the sequel was allegedly quite different from the final product.</p>
      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/terminator-dark-fate-tim-miller-interview/">Miller's newest film, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i></a> received positive critical response, but ultimately bombed at the box office. Like <i>Deadpool</i>, Miller had another contentious relationship on set, this time with James Cameron. The director recently admitted that he wouldn't want to work with Cameron again.</p>
      <p>Directed by Tim Miller and produced by James Cameron, <a href="https://screenrant.com/terminator-dark-fate-opening-scene-john-connor-death-good/">Terminator: Dark Fate</a> stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis, Gabriel Luna, Natalia Reyes and Diego Boneta. The film is in theaters now.</p>
