      <p>Apple’s new AirPods Pro are the first Apple earbuds that fit – and stay – in my ears, and there’s a good likelihood that anyone who had issues with how Apple’s earbuds fit in their ears could find solace in the AirPods Pro, too.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-airpods-pro-review-sound-quality-noise-cancellation-2019-10">The new AirPods Pro</a> have more of an earplug design that fit deeper into your ears than the regular AirPods and EarPods. They also come with three sizes of rubber tips to accommodate different ear sizes. My ears demand the largest rubber tips, and I can shake my head around without the AirPods Pro falling out.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the new AirPods Pro don’t actually <i>feel</i> like earplugs – they’re a cross between the older style and the earplug design. As a result, they’re <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-airpods-pro-favorite-workout-headphones-2019-11">supremely comfortable</a>, as they feel light and airy, and they don’t add as much pressure in my inner ear as regular earplug-style earphones</p>
      <p>With the original EarPods and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-airpods-review-2016-12">AirPods</a>, on the other hand, I could float in space without moving and they’d still slide out – they simply do not fit and stay in my ears.</p>

      <p>However, the new AirPods Pro costs $US250, which is a high asking price for a pair of Apple earbuds that may finally fit your ears, especially when you consider that Apple makes its cheaper AirPods and EarPods still available.</p>
      <p>One answer is to get a different pair of earphones with an earplug design that costs less. But that’s not a good solution if you want to make the most of the Apple ecosystem. Buying third-party means you’d be missing out on the Apple-only features like seamless pairing, Find AirPods, Siri integration, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-airpods-pro-review-puts-my-other-headphones-to-shame-2019-11">other little tidbits that make the Apple ecosystem great.</a></p>
      <p>The solution? Apple should now make the Lightning EarPods that come with iPhones and the regular $US160 AirPods in the same earplug design as the AirPods Pro.</p>
      <p>I’ve asked Apple if they plan on updating the regular AirPods and EarPods with the AirPods Pro design, but I haven’t heard back yet.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping.</p>
