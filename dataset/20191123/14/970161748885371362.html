      <p>Elizabeth Banks has opened up about feeling judged for using a surrogate to have children.</p>
      <p>The Charlie’s Angels director, who shares two kids with her husband Max Handelman, said she wasn’t able to carry her sons because of infertility issues.</p>
      <p>However, she believes that other people don’t understand her choices.</p>
      <p>‘I definitely think I’m still judged for what I’ve done and that people don’t understand my choices, but I don’t feel I owe anybody any explanation,’ she<a href="https://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/porter/article-27979f432011eedc/cover-stories/cover-stories/elizabeth-banks?cm_mmc=LinkshareUK-_-TnL5HPStwNw-_-LinkshareUS-_-TnL5HPStwNw-_-Custom-_-LinkBuilder&amp;siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-I_H0M0jPx28OMQqzHGv7gA&amp;Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com&amp;dclid=CKSomNjm_uUCFaosrQYdBKQHfQ&amp;siteID=TnL5HPStwNw-2DsMSZibMWhh6KXtVwxWSQ&amp;Skimlinks.com=Skimlinks.com"> told Net-a-Porter’s Porter Edit.</a></p>

      <p>‘If my story helps people feel less alone on their journey, then I’m grateful for that.’</p>
      <p>Elizabeth previously described her surrogate as ‘extraordinary’ <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2081892/Hunger-Games-star-Elizabeth-Banks-opens-using-surrogate-mother-son-Felix.html">to Lucky magazine</a>, saying she’s ‘like an auntie’ to her sons, 8-year-old Felix, and 7-year-old Magnus.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a big leap, inviting this person into your life to do this amazing, important thing for you,’ she added.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Elizabeth has been smashing it on new project Charlie’s Angels, which also stars Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, and Ella Balinksa.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/charlies-angels-box-office-bomb-taking-just-3-1m-first-two-days-release-11169987/">movie has been described as a box office disaster</a>, after earning just $3.1 million (£2.4 million) at the box office on its first two days of release.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/16/friday-box-office-ford-v-ferrari-matt-damon-christian-bale-1094-million-charlies-angels-bomb-kristen-stewart-good-liar-flop-helen-mirren/#504c79c4319c">According to Forbes</a>, the movie took home just $3.15 million on Thursday and Friday in the US, including just $900,000 (£697,400) on day one. It’s now on course to earn just $8.2 million (£6.3 million) from its opening weekend despite costing a big budget of $48 million (£37 million) to make.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Melanie Hughes-Weaver, the woman behind every make-up look in the new film, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/behind-scenes-elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-nearly-shut-movie-11189949/"><b>Metro.co.uk</b> that Elizabeth became worryingly ill on set.</a></p>
      <p>‘There was a scene where Banks was working and she had a 103 fever (39.5°C) and was directing and acting in the scene,’ she recalled.</p>
      <p>Melanie added: ‘There was an explosion and Sabina (played by Kristen) was being treated for some wounds. Banks’ character comes walking in.</p>
      <p>‘Like, she’s got a 103 fever and literally laying down (between takes) and we were trying to determine whether we should shut down production. She was so ill and going for it while on camera.’</p>
