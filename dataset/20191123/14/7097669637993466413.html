      <h1>These 5 Weapons Show Us How The U.S. Marines Would Fight North Korea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Kyle Mizokami</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>The U.S. Marines would be the tip of America's spear.</p>
      <p>In the event of a <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-war-north-korea-inevitable-22532">conflict</a> on the Korean Peninsula, U.S. and South Korean forces will root and and destroy the regime of Kim Jong-un. The need to properly secure the countryâ€™s weapons of mass destruction will necessitate an invasion of North Korea, much of which will come by sea. Leading the way will be the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). Here are five USMC weapon systems necessary in Korean War II.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1 - Amphibious Assault Vehicle</b>
      </p>
      <p>Any seaborne landing by the Marine infantry will involve<a href="http://www.military.com/equipment/aav7-amphibious-assault-vehicle"> Amphibious Assault Vehicles</a> (AAVs). First introduced in the early 1970s, AAVs carry up to twenty-one marine infantry and their equipment. Their amphibious nature means they can float out of the well deck of a U.S. Navy ship such as <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/us-marines-want-pack-20-stealth-fighters-one-assault-ship-20222">Wasp-class assault ships</a>, swim to shore on their own power and disgorge troops on the beachhead. Alternately, it can use its tracks to transport infantry farther inland.</p>

      </p>
      <p>AAVs are capable of traveling up to eight miles an hour in the water and up to forty-five miles an hour on land. They are lightly armed, typically carrying both a 40mm grenade launcher or .50 caliber machine gun. AAVs are lightly armored, at best capable of repelling 14.5mm machine gun fire or artillery shrapnel. This, combined with their large troop carrying capacity makes them vulnerable on the modern battlefield.</p>

        <b>2 - MV-22 Osprey</b>
      </p>
      <p>Modern amphibious assaults move marines as much by air as by sea. Aircraft can move faster and farther than AAVs and landing craft, even landing miles away from the nearest beachhead. This vastly increases the amount of terrain enemy forces must actively defend.</p>
