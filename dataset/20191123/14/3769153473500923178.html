      <blockquote><b>Features:</b><br/><br/>● High performance: Thumbnails are generated by a C++ worker thread in the background, the Blender UI stays fully responsive at all times<br/>● Low memory usage: Each thumbnail takes up 265 KiB of graphics RAM (regardless of the size of the previewed texture). 100 thumbnails would use 25.6 MiB - a negligible amount.<br/>● Supported image formats: jpg, png, hdr, psd, tga, bmp, gif<br/>● Supported Cycles nodes: Image Texture and Environment Texture<br/>● No changes are made to the .blend, others without the addon can still open your scenes without problems<br/>● High-resolution displays supported (works with Blender's resolution scale feature)<br/><br/><b>Caveats:</b><br/><br/>● Thumbnails are not displayed for packed images<br/>● EXR format currently not supported<br/>● Thumbnails of image sequences are not updated when changing frames</blockquote>
