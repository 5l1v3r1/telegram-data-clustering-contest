      <h1>Manuel Pellegrini may regret Adrian comments after another goalkeeping horror show</h1>
      <h2>The Reds number two left the Hammers for free in the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:06:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/elliott-jackson/" target="_blank">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>West Ham United manager Manuel Pellegrini may begin to rue his latest comments about Liverpool goalkeeper <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/adrian">Adrian</a>.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard left the Hammers in the summer on a free transfer and has proved a handy addition for the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Reds</a> after an early-season injury to Alisson.</p>
      <p>Adrian deputised fantastically, earning himself an instant spot in the hearts of the Liverpool supporters.</p>
      <p>However, West Ham are now suffering a goalkeeping crisis of their own, with first-choice shot-stopper Lukas Fabianski ruled out until 2020.</p>
      <p>Following the departure of Adrian, West Ham pumped for Roberto as their new number two from Espanyol.</p>
      <p>However, the Spaniard has suffered a rocky start to life in goal with a number of high-profile mistakes, including a comical own goal where he punched a corner into his own net.</p>
      <p>Despite that, Pellegrini has insisted he doesn't regret letting Adrian leave the club in the summer.</p>
      <p>"No regrets because we did everything we could to keep Adrian,” he told the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/westham/spotlight-on-roberto-with-west-ham-goalkeeper-cast-in-the-adrian-role-as-lukasz-fabianski-s-a4254046.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1570181484">Evening Standard</a>.</p>
      <p>"He was a player who played six or seven years at West Ham and was a goalkeeper I trusted a lot, but for different reasons, he did not arrive to reach a new contract.</p>
      <p>"I do not have any regrets about that because I have a lot of trust in Roberto."</p>
      <p>However, Roberto's latest blunder may have the former Manchester City boss reconsidering his goalkeeping options in January.</p>
      <p>Roberto was at fault yet against on Saturday as Heung-Min Son fired the ball through the goalkeeper for Tottenham's opening goal against the Hammers.</p>
      <p>After yet another high-profile mistakes, West Ham fans are calling for Pellegrini, and their new goalkeeper, to be axed, with both badly out of form.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, Liverpool fans are all saying the same thing about Adrian's summer move.</p>
