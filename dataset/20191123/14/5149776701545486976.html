      <h1>Sabri Lamouchi names his Nottingham Forest starting XI to face Bristol City</h1>
      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's Reds are back in action on the road at Ashton Gate, backed by a sold-out traveling support</h2>

      <p>Sabri Lamouchi made one change to his <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> side to face play-off rivals Bristol City at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>Forest return to action after the international break, hoping to steel a march on one of the Championship’s form teams and the Frenchman opted to bring in Jack Robinson in place of Yuri Ribeiro, who was left out of the squad altogether owing to injury, which is not believed to be serious.</p>
      <p>There was a return to the matchday squad for Michael Dawson, taking his place on the bench along with the returning John Bostock.</p>

      <p>Brice Samba was again picked in between the sticks, with Robinson and Matty Cash occupying left and right-back with Joe Worrall and Tobias Figueiredo in the middle.</p>
      <p>Captain Ben Watson was again partnered alongside Ryan Yates in the holding role, meaning Lamouchi opted for an attacking quartet of Sammy Ameobi down the left, Joe Lolley on the right with Tiago Silva, fresh from his excellent display against Derby in the number 10 role, in behind leading scorer Lewis Grabban.</p>
      <p>On the bench joining Dawson and Bostock, were Joao Carvalho, Rafa Mir, Chema Rodriguez, Aro Muric and Albert Adomah.</p>
      <p>A win in Bristol would see Forest cement their spot inside the top six and claim a fifth away win, more than they achieved in the whole of last season.</p>
      <p>The Reds slipped to sixth in the league on Friday night and City seventh, after Fulham came from behind to beat Forest’s Wednesday night opponents QPR 2-1.</p>
      <p><b>Forest:</b> Samba, Cash, Worrall, Figueiredo, Robinson, Yates, Watson, Lolley, Silva, Ameobi, Grabban. Subs: Muric, Carvalho, Bostock, Mir, Dawson, Chema, Adomah.</p>
