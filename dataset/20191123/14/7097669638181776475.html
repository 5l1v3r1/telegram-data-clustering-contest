      <p>Half a million pounds of pork product has been recalled by the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) after it received an anonymous tip that these items had been produced without inspection.</p>
      <p>The FSIS published a list on <a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/recall-case-archive/archive/2019/recall-116-2019-release">Thursday</a> of the 50 impacted items, which includes everything from fresh pork loin to pork back ribs, and ham.</p>
      <p>These items were produced by Morris Meat Packing, which operates in Maywood, Illinois – between November 25, 2017, and November 9, 2019, on Saturdays, outside inspection hours. They were then distributed to retailers around Illinois. </p>
      <p>FSIS categorized this as a class 1 recall, which signifies that there is "a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death," it said. </p>
      <p>While there haven't yet been any reported cases of customers falling sick after consuming these items, the FSIS is urging anyone who believes that they may have purchases these not to consume them. </p>
