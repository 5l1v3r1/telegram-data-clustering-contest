        <b>Pagalpanti has underperformed at the ticket windows on Day 1, but never mind; its actress Urvashi Rautela is planning to take a 48 logon ka gang into a Lucknow theatre tomorrow night</b>
      </p>
      <p>Urvashi Rautela is either not aware of the bad reviews or the under-performance of her latest film Pagalpanti (wherein she has a small role of a ghost), but word at the SpotboyE.com edit desk is that the actress has blocked 48 tickets for her friends in Lucknow to see the film with them. Can't blame her, she's in the film. And who knows, some members of her gang might like it. The invitees comprise of mainly those who are currently shooting with her in Lucknow for a South remake and share a good equation with her.</p>
      <p>A source from the Lucknow set, says, "Urvashi is very excited about Pagalpanti and the fact that we are seeing it tomorrow. She has first decided to take us out for dinner. From there, we shall proceed for a late-night show. We are looking forward to it." Adds the source, "Urvashi shot for some scenes on the bike, today. Tomorrow will be a picnic after we wind up for the day."</p>

      <p>The film has been a disappointment at the turnstiles, so far. The first day box-office collection is just about Rs 5 crore, which is far below expectations. A huge jump is required in today and tomorrow's collections to take this film anywhere. </p>
      <p>But then you never know, there have been cases of films which have been written off but came back to make a decent collection. Let's hope that for the producers (T-Series), distributor (Anand Pandit) and director (Anees Bazmee) and actors (Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Pulkit Samrat, Arshad Warsi, Kriti Kharbanda, Ileana Dsouza and Saurav Shukla).</p>
      <p>Just a quick question: Has Rautela bought as many as 48 tickets? Or did she tell the distributor/producer to arrange those for her?   <br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- instagram/urvashirautela</i></p>
