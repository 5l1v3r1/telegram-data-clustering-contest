      <p>MIDTOWN, Manhattan -- Every winter, the Rockettes dazzle audiences with their iconic high kicks and fun dance numbers on the stage, but off the stage, several are pulling double duty as mothers.<br/><br/>"I have three girls," Rockette Tara Tubridy said. "My oldest will be 3 in January, and I have twins."<br/><br/>Tubridy's twins are just 5 months old, and she is one of seven Rockettes this year who are mothers, and they are about as level-headed as they come. Motherhood helps them connect to their audience.<br/><br/>"We are in the audience, running down the aisles, and in their faces sometimes," Rockette Sarah Staker said. "And I think it's a connection that people can tell."<br/><br/>Being at home was the other payoff for Rockette Brittany Newnham.<br/><br/>"It was nice to go to work and show my kids, mommy does this, too," she said. "And mommy can be strong and live her dreams as well."<br/><br/>And strong would be an understatement for Rockette Melinda, who performed while she was six months pregnant, rehearsing six days a week, six hours a day.<br/><br/>The three-month performance season gives them a nice balance the rest of the year with their kids.<br/><br/>All of them have been Rockettes for years before they became moms, having 48 years of experience between them.<br/><br/>"Right before I leave for work every day, he says, 'Mommy's going to be a reindeer,'" Melinda said.<br/><br/>Their kids are believers that mommy knows Santa, but also that mommy magic is about as spectacular as it gets.</p>
