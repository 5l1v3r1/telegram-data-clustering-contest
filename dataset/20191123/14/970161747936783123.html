      <p>A man has been jailed after he threw a petrol canister and flicked a lighter at a nightclub full of people because it didn’t sell Red Bull.</p>
      <p>Michael Day, 38, screamed ‘I’m going to burn every last one of you’ before Shush nightclub, in Wantage, Oxfordshire, had to be evacuated.</p>
      <p>Day, of Wantage, was set to stand trial for the incident but later admitted attempted arson and two counts of making threats to kill.</p>
      <p>He descended into an explosive rage after bar staff had served him an alternative drink, as they didn’t sell Red Bull, on April 28, heard Oxford Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Day became aggressive and was thrown out of the club – where he had already been banned on another occasion – and went home.</p>
      <p>There he plotted his revenge and headed back to the club, where CCTV footage showed him armed with a 20-litre white plastic container partly filled with petrol.</p>

      <p>As he got near to the club entrance he was seen throwing it towards the door and launching himself in the path of door staff.</p>

      <p>Petrol was spilt on the ground and over the clothing of staff members, before Day flicked a lighter and screamed death threats, heard the court.</p>
      <p>Day, who also had a cigarette in his mouth, shouted racist abuse towards one worker and threatened to burn the club down.</p>
      <p>He shouted: ‘I am going to burn every last one of you’ and he said he would ‘burn them all’.</p>
      <p>As the smell of the fumes wafted inside the club, all 177 party-goers had to be evacuated.</p>
      <p>Day was arrested and he told officers he had drank up to seven Corona bottles and never intended to start a fire but wanted to ‘scare people’.</p>
      <p>In mitigation, his defence barrister said Day couldn’t remember the incident.</p>
      <p>Judge Maria Lamb called the episode ‘terrifying’ and jailed him for five years and two months.</p>
