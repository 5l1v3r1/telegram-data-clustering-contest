      <h1>Rory McIlroy’s 65 leaves him right in the mix in Dubai</h1>
      <h2>Jon Rahm and Mike Lorenzo-Vera hold the joint lead heading into the final round</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:22:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/philip-reid-7.1837464" target="_blank">Philip Reid</a></address>
      <p>The chase is on. Rory McIlroy will head into Sunday’s final round of the DP World Tour Championship on The Earth course in Dubai with a chance to add the European Tour’s season-ending tournament to the Tour Championship he has already claimed on the PGA Tour in the United States.</p>
      <p>McIlroy crafted a third round 65, the best of the day, to reach the 54-hole stage of the tournament – which has a $3 million payday to the winner – on 13-under-par 203, two strokes behind co-leaders Jon Rahm of Spain and Frenchman Mike Lorenzo-Vera. Shane Lowry shot a 70 for 211, three under, to be in tied-11th.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got to play another really good round of golf tomorrow to have a chance, but it would be awesome to win around here again, and obviously cap off what has been a great 2019,” said McIlroy of his mindset ahead of the final round.</p>
      <p>Having struggled to a 74 on Friday, McIlroy spent a considerable amount of time on the range trying to resolve his problems. “Sometimes when I hit a lot of shots into the wind, I get a bit too much on my left side on the way down, and my left knee starts to go forward. My arms get too deep in the downswing and then I start missing it left, basically . . . (on the range) I was just trying to really feel like my left knee gets out of the way so my arms can come down in front of me a little bit more and I can start the ball a little bit more online. I just worked on that.”</p>
      <p>It worked a treat, as his 65 – five birdies and an eagle in a bogey-free round – saw McIlroy move ominously into contention. The highlight of the Northern Irishman’s third round was an eagle three on the Par 5 seventh hole, where he hit a 5-wood approach from 255 yards and rolled in the short eagle putt. But it was a clutch par save putt on the 18th, where he hit his approach into the hazard, that had him fist-pumping the air as he sought to carry the momentum onward into the final round.</p>
      <p>Lowry struggled for a large part of his round but persevered to be on the fringes of the top-10 heading into the final day. “Golf is such a funny game, it’s chalk and cheese how I played the last couple of days but similar enough score . . . . I did what I do best today, got the ball around in as few strokes as I could have,” said the Offalyman, who birdied the last to get to five-under.</p>

      <p>He added: “I’ve one more (competitive) round of what has been a pretty good year. I will set myself a target, double figures maybe, so if I can shoot five under that’s a decent target to have.”</p>
      <p>Lorenzo-Vera held a four stroke lead over Rahm as he started the back nine, but the Spaniard enjoyed a bogey-free homeward run featuring four birdies to sign for a 66 while a closing bogey from the Frenchman left the pair locked together at the top of the leaderboard. A win for Rahm also would propel him to the Race to Dubai order of merit when it matters most.</p>
