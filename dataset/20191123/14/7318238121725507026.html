      <p>Protesters in Paris hit the streets today to condemn violence against women ahead of an international awareness day on Monday (November 25).</p>
      <p>It comes as the number of femicides in France is already larger this year than it was in 2018. Many protesters held signs with the names of women killed by a partner or ex-partner.</p>
      <p>At least 49,000 protesters showed up in Paris, according to the independent research firm Occurrence.</p>
