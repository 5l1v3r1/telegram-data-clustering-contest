        <b>On 17 November, France’s most prominent protest movement marked one year since the beginning of the popular rallies that have spread across the country, with demonstrations leading to clashes with police and arrests.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On Saturday, Yellow Vest demonstrators gather for a new rally in Paris, a week after the movement turned one year old.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations first started on 17 November 2018, with over 280,000 people taking to the streets of French cities over fuel price hikes. Some 2,000 separate rallies were held, leading to one person being killed and more than 200 others sustaining injuries. On top of that, 117 protesters were arrested.</p>
      <p>Since then, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911171077332045-yellow-vests-vow-to-continue-rallies-on-anniversary-of-movement-say-government-deaf-to-protests/">rallies have become regular</a>, with people taking to the streets every Saturday for over a year. As the government abandoned its plan to raise the fuel tax, the demonstrators turned to other demands, such as fewer taxes, wage hikes, and Macron’s resignation, among other things.</p>
