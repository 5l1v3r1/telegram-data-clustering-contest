      <p>Patriots owner Robert Kraft was never on the same page as President Donald Trump when it came to players protesting racial injustice at NFL games.</p>
      <p>In a leaked audio recording from a 2017 NFL meeting, Kraft can be heard criticizing Trump for being "divisive and horrible." The meeting came one month after Trump ripped <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/donald-trump-anthem-protests-nfl-colin-kaepernick/iqtrms1q485a1byw7rbsx9lai">"son of a bitch" protestors</a>for kneeling during the national anthem anddisrespecting the American flag.</p>

      <p>"I must tell you, I think these dialogues are great,"Kraft said in a recording <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/robert-kraft-nfl-donald-trump-kneelers-new-audio/">shared by TMZ</a>. "Butthe elephant in the room now, in my opinion, is this kneeling, which every player has a right to do if they feel it's right. The problem we have is, we have a president that will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don't feel is in the best interest of the matter.</p>
      <p>"It's divisive, and it's horrible. Andit's actually the opposite of what you all are trying to do."</p>

      <p>Kraft added that the NFL had "lost the message to America" because nearly half of the population would be on Trump's side.</p>
      <p>"I just hope one of the things that can come out of here is that we find a way to be unified, andbe able to carry through and follow through," Kraft said.</p>
      <p>About 30 people attended the meeting, including owners, executives and players, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/sports/nfl-owners-kaepernick.html">The New York Times</a>. Team owners were reportedly focused on finding a way to avoid Trump's disapproval and warned players not to get drawn into a war of words with the president.</p>
      <p>Despite all of the controversy at the time, this disagreement doesn't seem to have hurt Kraft's longtime friendship with Trump.</p>
      <p>Kraft praised Trump during a February interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSrtes_iZdU">with Fox News</a>, saying he's "working very hard to serve the best interests of the country." Kraft also sat at Trump's table during an official state dinner in July, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bob-kraft-attends-state-dinner-qatari-emir-with-trump-lagarde-2019-7">Business Insider</a>.</p>
