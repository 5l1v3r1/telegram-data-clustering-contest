      <p>Jonson Clarke-Harris will miss Bristol Rovers; trip to Shrewsbury Town through injury.</p>
      <p>The talismanic <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> striker has only <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/exclusive-bristol-rovers-hit-major-3405656">recently returned from a calf injury that kept him out of action for around six weeks,</a> playing in two FA Cup ties and an EFL Trophy match.</p>
      <p>Yet he has not featured in a League One game for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> since scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory over Rotherham United on September 28.</p>

      <p>Clarke-Harris' absence is thought to be more of a precaution than any major recurrence of the calf strain, with the striker having played the full 90 minutes of Rovers' FA Cup replay victory over Bromley on Tuesday night, scoring an early winner.</p>
      <p>Manager Graham Coughlan gave Clarke-Harris - and other players returning from injury - the choice of whether to feature in the game, with it being played on a plastic pitch.</p>
      <p>Both Clarke-Harris and captain Ollie Clarke subsequently played the full 90 in a tight match.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> boss has always taken a risk vs reward approach to playing his players through injury and, with a busy Christmas period rapidly approaching, it has been decided Clarke-Harris will miss this afternoon's game.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Official_BRFC/status/1198240534424358912">Speaking to BBC Radio Bristol,</a> Coughlan confirmed that Clarke-Harris had a reaction to the artificial pitch.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’ve lost Jonno, he’s had a reaction to the surface the other night. It’s nothing major but it’s too much of a risk to put him out again today so he didn’t travel with us.</p>
      <p>“Victor Adeboyejo will come in up top and Ed Upson comes back into midfield.</p>
      <p>“The front three will be Ollie Clarke, Liam Sercombe and Victor.”</p>
      <p>Coughlan does not regret the decision to play him at Bromley, though.</p>
      <p>“It was a risk worth taking, he went and got the winning goal.</p>
      <p>“He wanted to play, he put his hand up, as did others.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say I regret putting Jonno out, we put our strongest team out in every game we possibly can.</p>
      <p>“We knew there’d be implications with the surface but it wasn’t until yesterday when we did some training and a bit of work that he felt a bit tight.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a lot of big games coming up in the next few weeks, so it was lose him for one or chuck him in today and risk him for half a dozen.</p>
      <p>“Even an Irishman can work the maths out on that one.</p>
      <p>“We’ve gone into battle without him before and I’m sure we’ll do it again. It’s nothing new, nothing strange, I’ve just challenged the lads to show we’re not a one-man team.</p>
      <p>“Go and show there is life without Jonno.”</p>
