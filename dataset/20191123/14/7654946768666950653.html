      <h1>Hong Kong campus cleared of protesters after police siege</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:15:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sara Dorn</a></address>
      <p>The Hong Kong university campus that became an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/hong-kong-police-storm-university-campus-barricaded-by-protesters/">encampment for hundreds of anti-government protesters</a> was mostly cleared out on Saturday, days after police stormed the campus, turning it into a virtual war zone.</p>
      <p>The handful of protesters left at Polytechnic University in the Kowloon peninsula were holed up in hiding spots throughout the wrecked campus, outnumbered by the media, police and rescue workers swarming the grounds.</p>
      <p>Some said they refused to surrender.</p>
      <p>“I’ll continue to stay here, but hopefully not forever,” said Ah Chung, who was clad in one of the red face masks that were <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/hong-kong-court-reinstates-mask-ban-ahead-of-elections/">banned by a court on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>Others were planning their escapes, fearful of joining the 1,000-plus people who have been arrested during the six months of protests.</p>
      <p>Social workers on site were attempting to coax people out of hiding spots.</p>
      <p>““They’ve been in this highly stressful environment for so long, over 120 hours … we’re trying to urge them to come out in a gentle manner,” said a social worker named Sendon, who refused to give his last name.</p>
      <p>The exodus follows protesters’ violent clash with police on Monday and Sunday. Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets as bricks and Molotov cocktails flew around them. On Sunday, an officer was shot in the leg with an arrow.</p>
      <p>Authorities expect a brief reprieve from the turmoil during what is expected to be a historical election on Sunday, with a record 4.1 million people registered to vote.</p>
