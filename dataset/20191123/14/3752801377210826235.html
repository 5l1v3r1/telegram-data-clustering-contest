      <p>Former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton said the White House denied him access to his Twitter account after his dismissal in early September, in a series of tweets that signal his return to the social media site.</p>
      <p>"Since resigning as National Security Advisor, the White House has refused to return access to my personal Twitter account. Out of fear of what I may say?" Bolton wrote on Friday.</p>
      <p>Prior to Friday's series of tweets, nothing had been published by Bolton since September 10, the day the US president announced his dismissal.</p>
      <p>"To those who speculated I went into hiding, I'm sorry to disappoint!" he added.</p>
      <p>The White House swept aside the charges, with spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham suggesting Bolton simply didn't know how to use the platform.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes, I'll use my father as an example," she told a Fox Business Network discussion program.</p>
      <p>"Somebody who is of an advanced age may not understand all you have to do is contact Twitter and reset your password if you've forgotten it."</p>
      <p>Since being dismissed, 71-year-old John Bolton has disagreed with the US president's strategy on North Korea.</p>
      <p>Early on Friday, the former diplomat announced his return to Twitter with an enigmatic message: "Glad to be back on Twitter after more than two months. For the backstory, stay tuned...".</p>
      <p>His final tweet in the series read: "Thank you to Twitter for standing by their community standards and rightfully returning control of my account."</p>
