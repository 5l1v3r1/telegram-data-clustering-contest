        <b>Aston Villa boss Dean Smith has warned circling clubs to forget about trying to poach Jack Grealish and John McGinn when the January transfer window opens.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both players have been in scintillating form this season following Villa’s return to the Premier League, even if they find themselves in a precarious position just one place and three points above the relegation zone ahead of Monday’s visit of Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The duo also have long-term contracts, with skipper Grealish signing a new deal last September through to 2023, while McGinn put pen to paper in August to tie him to Villa until 2024.</p>
      <p>The pair are, however, attracting considerable attention, with <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/man-utd-still-scouting-premier-league-dynamo-ahead-of-potential-january-transfer"><b>Manchester United understood to be still keen on McGinn,</b></a> yet a defiant Smith said: “There’s been a lot of speculation about a lot of our players.</p>
      <p>“But we’ve two owners who want to build a football club, challenging in the top half of the table, and top six in a few years’ time.</p>
      <p>“To do that you have to keep your best players and I’ve no doubts in my mind the owners will want to keep those players.”</p>
      <p>Grealish returns to skipper the side against the Magpies after a four-week lay-off with a calf injury, while McGinn heads into the game following a superb week on international duty with Scotland, scoring three goals in two games in the Euro 2020 qualifying wins over Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>A smiling Smith said: “Hopefully John will go and get a few for us now he has hit the goal trail. He said to me, ‘If you need to throw me up front you can do’.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/bruce-talks-up-mcginn-to-man-utd-and-lights-blue-touch-paper-at-villa-park"><b>Newcastle manager and former Villa boss Steve Bruce claimed McGinn was currently performing “at Man United level”</b></a> such have been his high standards of late.</p>
      <p>Smith, who at least credits Bruce for “a great buy” as McGinn cost around £2.75million when he joined Villa from Hibernian last August, feels there is still room to grow.</p>
      <p>“He’s improving every game he plays,” said Smith. “He works hard in training, he’s scoring goals at international level as well, so he just needs to keep on with that improvement.</p>
      <p>“I’ve no doubt he will because he has a great head on his shoulders. He’s an intelligent boy, but on top of that he’s a really good lad in the dressing room.”</p>
