      <p>“We want to approve more builders. Once that is done, the turn around time will be very less,” said R. Anuradha, zonal manager (Bengaluru), Syndicate Bank, which is the finance partner.</p>
      <p>“For housing loans, the interest offered starts at 8.1%. We have an exclusive scheme for senior citizens aged between 60 to 70, with no hidden costs. We would like to increase the number of housing loans very aggressively. We have separate schemes for women,” Ms. Anuradha, who inaugurated the event, said.</p>
      <p>She also spoke about the recent economic slowdown which has been especially hard on small businesses. “On account of the economic situation, there is a dip in sales, but there is always demand for housing. We are showing constant growth,” she said.</p>
