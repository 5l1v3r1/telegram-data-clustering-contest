      <h1>Crystal Palace vs Liverpool confirmed line-ups: Who will start in Premier League fixture?</h1>
      <h2>The two sides go head to head at Selhurst Park this afternoon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:29:28+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Samuel Lovett</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> host league leaders <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LiverpoolFC">Liverpool</a> at Selhurst Park today, with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RoyHodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>'s men looking for their first win in five games.</p>
      <p>The Eagles are emerging from a torrid run of matches that has pitted them against four of the traditional big six as well as European hopefuls Leicester.</p>
      <p>Despite picking up just one point since 6 October, Palace currently lie in 12th in the league.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, meanwhile, continue to sit pretty atop the table, with six points separating them from second-placed Leicester.</p>
      <p>The last meeting between the two sides ended in a 4-3 victory for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Jurgen_Klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a>‘s side back in January.</p>
      <h3>Predicted teams</h3>
      <p>Palace XI: Guaita, Ward, Tomkins, Cahill, van Aanholt; Kouyaté, Milivojevic, McArthur, Townsend, Zaha; Ayew.</p>
      <p>Liverpool XI: Alisson; TAA, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Fabinho, Wijnaldum, Henderson; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mane, Firmino.</p>
      <h3>Prediction </h3>
      <p>Palace came close to upsetting Liverpool in their last encounter, but you feel this showdown will be a much more straight-forward affair given the leaders’ current form. While the Reds’ style of play may favour Crystal Palace’s counter-attacking approach, Jurgen Klopp’s side are running like a well-oiled machine at the moment and it’s hard to see them giving an inch against the Eagles. Assuming they can keep Palace’s danger men quiet, this should be a comprehensive victory for Liverpool.</p>
