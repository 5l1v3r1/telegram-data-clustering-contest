      <h1>What West Ham hero Joe Cole has said about Manuel Pellegrini's future</h1>
      <h2>Joe Cole has offered his verdict on the future of Manuel Pellegrini at West Ham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:42:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke, Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Former West Ham United star Joe Cole has provided his verdict on the future of Manuel Pellegrini after the 3-2 loss at home to Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The Hammers are struggling and have now lost six of their opening 13 matches in the 2019/20 Premier League season.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the Saturday 3pm games the club were five points above the relegation zone but Cole was quick to not throw the 66-year-old under the bus immediately after the match.</p>
      <p>"We talked at half-time and we thought, maybe it wasn't so much about the result but the performance and how they got beat," Cole told BT Sport. "They really galvanised, Antonio was excellent when he came on.</p>
      <p>Cole was asked if that was it for Pellegrini and he responded by saying: "I don't think so (the end for Pellegrini) and I don't want to be the one to say so.</p>
      <p>"He's having a tough time, results speak for themselves and we're in crazy season at the moment. Managers are coming and going but it is a tough one."</p>
      <p>Asked if he would be interested in the role should it become vacant, Cole added "I would love to see West Ham do well. For this club historically they need a young manager with a plan.</p>
