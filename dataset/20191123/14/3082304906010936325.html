        <b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain starts ahead of the not fully fit Mohamed Salah for Liverpool’s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah is only fit enough to be named as a substitute for Premier League leaders Liverpool’s visit to Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Salah has been suffering from an ongoing ankle injury, which he appeared to aggravate in the Reds’ 3-1 win over Manchester City before the international break.</p>
      <p>That kept him out of the most recent Egypt squad, with Jurgen Klopp choosing to start Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in attack alongside Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino for the visit to Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Left-back Andy Robertson has also been suffering from an ankle problem but is fit enough to be named in the starting XI.</p>
      <p>Palace, meanwhile, are unchanged from the side that lost 2-0 to Chelsea a fortnight ago.</p>
