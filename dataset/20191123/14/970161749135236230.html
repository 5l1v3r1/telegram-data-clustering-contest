      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> admits it was not a difficult decision to bench <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> for Liverpool’s clash with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Salah has been struggling with an ankle injury for several weeks and the forward did not link up with Egypt during the international break.</p>
      <p>Klopp is confident that Salah will not require surgery to fix his ankle problem but the Liverpool manager admits he is carefully managing the player’s recovery.</p>
      <p>And for Liverpool’s trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon, Salah dropped to the bench and was replaced by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> in the starting line-up.</p>

      <p>Asked if it took a lot of thinking to play Oxlade Chamberlain ahead of Salah, Klopp told Sky Sports: ‘No, during the week a little bit because we didn’t know exactly how Mo would come back or how especially Oxlade would come back.</p>

      <p>‘But Mo, yesterday was the first session where everything was fine, but it was a bit late then, to be honest.</p>
      <h3>LIVERPOOL XI VS CRYSTAL PALACE</h3>
      <p><b>LIVERPOOL:</b> Alisson; Alexander–Arnold, Lovren, Van Dijk, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Firmino, Mane</p>
      <p><b>SUBS:</b> Adrian, Milner, Keita, Salah, Gomez, Lallana, Origi.</p>
      <p>‘So we decided to bring Ox in a good moment and that’s all.</p>
      <p>‘Mo having him here helps a lot, probably for a decisive part of the game, that’s how it is.’</p>
