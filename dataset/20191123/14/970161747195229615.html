      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has revealed one of his ex-girlfriends features on is new album, Fine Line, and fans think they’ve worked out which one it is.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> star, 25, revealed that his new song Cherry from his upcoming second album was inspired by a break-up and includes a voice message from his ex at the end of the song.</p>
      <p>While he didn’t mention which particular ex the track is about – and he’s yet to release it for fans to hear the voice – everyone’s convinced he’s talking about Camille Rowe.</p>
      <p>He told Zane Lowe: ‘When we listened back to the album, I asked her to add it in. I think she liked [the song.]</p>
      <p>‘Cherry is about… I wanted it to reflect how I felt then. I was feeling not great. It’s all about being not great.</p>

      <p>‘Because, you get petty when things don’t go the way you want it. There’s parts that’s so pathetic.’</p>
      <p>Harry dated model Camille from 2017 until 2018, with their break-up happening before he began work on the album.</p>

      <p>Cherry isn’t the only song about her, however – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/harry-styles-takes-us-back-summer-new-song-watermelon-sugar-slaying-saturday-night-live-11171498/">Watermelon Sugar was also reported to be influenced by their relationship too</a>.</p>
      <p>Camille had said the book of the same name, Watermelon Sugar by Richard Brautigan, is her favourite book in a 2017 interview with Elle magazine.</p>
      <p>Harry’s friend Tom Hull, who worked with him in the new album, also revealed that the split from Camille affected the writing process for the album.</p>
      <p>He revealed: ‘He went through this breakup that had a big impact on him. I turned up on day one in the studio, and I had these really nice slippers on.</p>

      <p>‘His ex-girlfriend that he was really cut up about, she gave them to me as a present – she bought slippers for my whole family. We’re still close friends with her. I thought, “I like these slippers. Can I wear them—is that weird?”</p>
      <p>‘So I turn up at Shangri-La the first day and literally within the first half-hour, he looks at me and says, “Where’d you get those slippers? They’re nice”.</p>
      <p>‘I had to say, “Oh, um, your ex-girlfriend got them for me.” He said, “Whaaaat? How could you wear those?”</p>

      <p>‘He had a whole emotional journey about her, this whole relationship. But I kept saying, “The best way of dealing with it is to put it in these songs you’re writing.”’</p>
      <p>Fine Line will be released on 13 December – and we’ll finally get to hear which ex is actually on the album.</p>
