      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/gavin-stacey-star-alison-steadman-20938379">OK!,</a> the actress said: "I thought, 'Can I do it again? Can I get the character back properly?'"</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, despite possible doubts, Alison suggested the dynamic between the cast settle any worries there may have been.</p>

      <p>She continued: "But as soon as we were all back together it was just like a family reunion. At the end we were all really sad to say goodbye."</p>

      <p>The hugely popular show last aired in 2010, ending in series three with Stacey (played by Joanna Page) and Gavin (Mat Horne) expecting their first baby together.</p>
      <p>Fans are <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/ruth-jones-reveals-exciting-news-about-gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special/">desperate to know what has happened to the characters since then</a>, but details of the festive script are being kept top secret.</p>
      <p>However, prior to filming, Mat told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/5live">Radio 5 Live</a>: "There’s very, very little I can give away - suffice to say [Gavin's] a little bit tired... and he’s a dad with an almost grown up child.</p>
      <p>"I think the audience will be pleasantly surprised and warmed by what they see... I have every confidence people are going to really like it.</p>

      <p>"The script is really beautiful, it’s really funny and it’s really heartwarming. I think there'll be laughter and tears. Ruth and James have done an incredible job particularly considering they live in different countries."</p>
      <p>He added: "There’s one scene in particular between me and Joanna [Page who plays Stacey] which is absolutely beautiful. I was talking to Jo yesterday and we can’t wait to get going on it."</p>
