      <h1>ESPN’s Paul Finebaum Issues An Apology To Rob Mullens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:13:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, ESPN analyst Paul Finebaum made headlines for <a href="https://thespun.com/college-hoops/paul-finebaum-on-cfb-playoff-chairman-rob-mullens-i-dont-trust-him">calling out College Football Playoff committee chairman Rob Mullens.</a> Before most programs take the field this weekend, he publicly apologized for those comments.</p>
      <p>Finebaum said the reason he’s not a fan of Mullens is that he cannot trust him.</p>
      <p>These comments from Finebaum were made shortly after Mullens explained why certain teams are ranked so high in the latest College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect, there were several people critical of Finebaum’s take on Mullens.</p>
      <p>While the damage might already be done, Finebaum went on his own radio show to apologize to the chairman of the committee.</p>
      <p>Here’s what Finebaum had to say to Mullens, via <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Paul-Finebaum-Rob-Mullens-dishonest-apology-College-Football-Playoff-chair-Oregon-139020249/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Last night, we were having a conversation about the College Football Playoff, and about its chairman, Rob Mullens, who is the athletic director at the University of Oregon,” Finebaum said to open his show on Friday. “And I have been critical of the process. I have been critical of the fact that Mr. Mullens is representing Oregon as the athletic director, although, officially he’s not representing them as the chairman of the College Football Playoff (committee).<br/><br/>“And I said some things that, quite frankly, were wrong and inappropriate. This morning, on the way over to Athens, I called Rob Mullens out in Oregon and personally apologized to him, telling him that it doesn’t matter what I intended to say, I am responsible for what I said.</blockquote>
      <p>Finebaum said that Mullens quickly accepted his apology. He also mentioned that they plan on meeting up at some point in the near future.</p>
      <p>Mullens and the rest of the committee have an important weekend of college football ahead, as they must assess which teams deserve to rise and which deserve to fall in next week’s rankings.</p>
