      <p>The mother of six was 15 weeks into her pregnancy with her baby son at the time, <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/death-pregnant-mum-six-prompts-17295963?_ga=2.38605604.621358390.1574519196-194102233.1559548755">North Wales Live reports</a> .</p>
      <p>A post-mortem revealed that she had an 'abnormally high' level of the drug in her body, amounting to eight times over the level for driving.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination revealed the mother had damage to her heart known as cardiac fibrosis, which can be caused by chronic cocaine use.</p>
      <p>Coroner Dewi Pritchard concluded the death was caused by natural causes, but said the high level of cocaine would have contributed to her death.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/courts">inquest</a> at Caernarfon in North Wales: "I am seeing far too many cocaine deaths as the use of cocaine in this part of the world is very common.</p>
      <p>"Cocaine damages the heart by killing off patches of heart tissue and causes a tightening of the vessels.</p>
      <p>"Even low levels of cocaine can cause catastrophic results and repeat use causes more and more damage.</p>
      <p>"The public think cocaine doesn't do any long-term harm but it does.</p>
      <p>"Cocaine use can and does cause long term issues."</p>
      <p>It was also noted that Miss Hughes' immune system would have been suppressed due to the fact she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>Mr Pritchard added: "If she had not taken cocaine in the past the probability is that she would have survived the broncho-pneumonia, but we cannot be sure."</p>
      <p>Ms Hughes' friend, Helen Evans, described her as 'full of life' and a 'brilliant mother'.</p>
      <p>"She was a devoted mother and partner, caring daughter and joyful sister - her death has left a massive hole in so many people's lives", she said.</p>
      <p>It's reported that Ms Hughes' parents are caring for her six children, aged 16 to one.</p>
      <p>It says: "Mother of 6 Lindsey aged 34  sadly passed away Wednesday 27 March  along with her unborn baby. Leaving behind her 6 heartbroken children- partner Nick and her loving parents and siblings.</p>
      <p>"Lindsey - A fun loving girl with always a smile and a joke a devoted mother loving partner  caring daughter and joyful sister  leaves a massive hole in so many people's lives as her many friends will agree - her family now need our support as her parents take over the role of caring for her beloved children."</p>
