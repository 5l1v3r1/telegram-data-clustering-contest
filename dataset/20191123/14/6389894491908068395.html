      <p>European Union countries are endorsing a tough line on selecting 5G suppliers in a potential blow to market-leading telecoms equipment supplier Huawei.</p>
      <p>At a meeting in Brussels on Friday, ambassadors for EU states agreed to an approach which includes vetting the domestic legal framework 5G suppliers are subject to.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The news was confirmed by a spokesperson for Finland, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency.</p>
      <p>A draft document ahead of the meeting said, EU countries should consider non-technical factors such as the legal and policy framework to which suppliers may be subject in third countries, according to Reuters. Although no specific companies were mentioned.</p>
      <p>EU governments should also diversify their suppliers and not depend on one, the document said.</p>
      <p>Ministers from the member states are expected to give the green light to the approach at a meeting next month. </p>
      <p>The US has urged the EU to ban Huawei equipment amid an ongoing dispute and tensions with China.</p>
      <p>Concerns are based on Chinese law on domestic companies’ cooperation with the government on security, which the US believe could make Huawei a vehicle for spying.</p>
      <p>Huawei has denied the charges and dismissed them as groundless.</p>
      <p>Last month the EU warned of increasing risks of cyber attacks by state-backed entities, but did not name companies or countries.</p>
      <p>The promotion of 5G networks remains a key possibility to boost economic growth, the EU believes.</p>

      <p>It is looking into a “toolbox of measures” by the end of the year to address cyber security risks at national and continental level.</p>
      <p>The European Agency for Cybersecurity is also finalising a map of specific threats related to 5G networks.</p>
