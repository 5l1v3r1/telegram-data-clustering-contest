      <p>Tragedy struck a Dippin’ Dots facility in Kentucky after an explosion injured at least four people, <a href="https://www.wpsdlocal6.com/news/explosion-reported-at-dippin-dots-production-facility/article_e80e7a02-0d9d-11ea-941f-17128140dbcb.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter_WPSDLocal6">WSPD6 local reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It is not known what exactly caused the blast, or the extent of the damage to the Paducah facility, a company spokesperson told the Associated Press.</p>
      <p>A rep for the city said the plant appears to have had a nitrogen leak, but that it was unclear whether the possible leak had played a role in the blast. Nitrogen is an essential component of Dippin’ Dots, which is used to “flash freeze” the ice cream, the wire service reported.</p>
      <p>Dippin’ Dots has a cult following in the United States, and was famously involved in a feud with former White House press secretary Sean Spicer — a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/01/24/now-you-can-send-sean-spicer-all-the-dippin-dots/">longtime hater of the product.</a></p>
