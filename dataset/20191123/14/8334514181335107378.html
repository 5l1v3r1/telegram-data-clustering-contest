      <p>Ibrahim Assoumanou Abdel Azize, originally from Togo, his Nigerian partner Fethia Owolabi and their five-year old son Ibrahim were among 73 migrants plucked out of a rubber dinghy on Wednesday night by the crew of Spain-based rescue ship, Open Arms.</p>
      <p>The migrants, mostly from Central and West Africa, had been drifting around 50 miles off the Libyan coast for nearly 24 hours when they were picked up.</p>
      <p>Cradling his young son in his arms, Azize smiled with relief on the ship’s deck, Reuters TV footage showed.</p>
      <p>After leaving their home in Nigeria the family arrived in Libya where they worked odd jobs for two years to try and save the $1,300 needed to pay for the crossing.</p>
      <p>“You work for them, they don’t pay the money, that’s why we decided to leave Libya, we can’t live our life like that with my son, I just want to keep my kid safe, that’s why I left,” said Owolabi.</p>
      <p>UN figures show more than 1,000 migrants are believed to have drowned or gone missing while attempting to reach Europe from North Africa this year.</p>
      <p>Azize said the crossing was worth the risk to escape Libya.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to come to Europe, it wasn’t easy while I was on the water... if I must die on the water, it is better than returning to Libya,” he said.</p>
      <p>Owolabi said she had been terrified and wished she had stayed in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know the big sea... I was crying, I told the people ‘let’s go back’ because I was scared.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know it would be like this, if I had known this I wouldn’t have come, I would have gone back to my country.”</p>
      <p>Open Arms is seeking to dock at a European port, likely in Italy or Malta, mission chief Ricardo Gati said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Both countries have previously refused to let the vessel land rescued migrants at its ports. A weeks-long dispute with the Italian government this summer was only resolved after a court ordered authorities to open the port, allowing 100 migrants to disembark.</p>
