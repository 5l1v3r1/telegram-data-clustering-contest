      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/khloe-kardashian">Khloe Kardashian</a> is ‘’worried'' but ‘’in touch'' with her ex <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/french-montana">French Montana</a> after he was rushed to hospital yesterday.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/french-montana-hospital-after-cops-20936193">rapper was rushed to the hospital after experiencing nausea, stomach pains and an elevated heart rate</a> .</p>
      <p>Officers in the Calabasas area, where French lives, are said to have responded to a call about a possible robbery at the rapper's home.</p>
      <p>It was a false alarm - but it's reported the officers noticed something wasn't right.</p>

        <figcaption>It was thought that earlier this year, Khloe turned to her ex following her split from NBA player and father of her child, Tristan Thompson</figcaption>

      <p>French - real name Karim Kharbouch - is said to have been acting abnormally, with sources close to French telling TMZ that he'd been experiencing stomach pains, nausea and an elevated heart rate.</p>
      <p>A source also told the website that he was admitted to San Fernando Valley Hospital, and that close pals believe he may have been exposed to contaminated food.</p>
      <p>He was expected to be released early Friday, but he reportedly continues to experience stomach pains and remains in the hospital where doctors can continue to monitor his heart.</p>

      <p>A source has revealed to E! that with the rapper still in hospital <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians">Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star Khloe Kardashian felt inclined to “make sure he is going to be ok and see if he needs anything".</p>
      <p>“She is still worried about him and hoping he gets some good news and they figure out what’s going on,” the insider revealed.</p>
      <p>This likely means a lot to French Montana, who just this year said he and Khloe shared a “real” love.</p>

      <p>In an August interview, the star said, “When the love was like that, it’s always going to be like that. Friendship after a relationship is something that’s real hard to do, and I’m glad we’ve been able to do it.”</p>
      <p>The rapper's internationally renowned and respected, and his latest bout of travelling saw him jetting all over Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>French is known for a huge range of songs including Famous and No Stylist, in which he raps alongside Drake.</p>
