      <p>Millions of viewers across the globe have been glued to Netflix's dramatic chronicles of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>The Crown has dealt with some moving relationships during its three series while it depicts the life of our Monarch from the 1940s to modern times.</p>
      <p>But one which has caused the most eyebrows to raise is ties between The Queen - now played by Olivia Colman - and Lord "Porchey" Porchester, played by Joseph Kloska.</p>
      <p>The latest series has portrayed their long-running friendship and at one point hinted they were more than just friends.</p>
      <p>The fifth episode of the season, entitled Coup, sees Elizabeth II question what sort of life she could have had if she wasn't monarch, as the pair go on trips to aid their chances with their horse-racing endeavours.</p>
      <h3>Is The Crown suggesting any more than what history tells us about their relationship?</h3>

      <p>In the new official book <i>The Crown: The Inside History 1956-1977</i> , historian Robert Lacey writes: "Towards the end of Episode 305 a mildly jealous Prince Philip indecorously suggests it was not just Her Majesty's racehorses that 'Porchey' was very keen on injecting - and the lifelong personal friendship that Elizabeth II enjoyed with Lord Porchester until his death aged 77 in 2001 has sometimes been the source of inneundo.</p>
      <p>"But there is no historical basis for any suggestion of impropriety - and The Crown certainly has no truck with it."</p>
      <p>He adds: "On their 1967 trip to Normandy, for example, Elizabeth and 'Porchey' were accompanied by his Anglo-American wife Jean Wallop, who remained of the Queen's closest personal friends until her own death in April 2019."</p>
      <p>Lacey surmises: "The touching and unashamed intimacy enjoyed by Elizabeth II and Lord Porchester went back to the passion for horses they discovered they shared when they first got to know each other as teenagers.</p>
      <p>"We have seen this relationship developing in previous episodes of The Crown, and 305 is the episode that makes it official."</p>
      <p>That closes the book on that.</p>
