It’s going to be in Brooklyn most likely, I’m not sure about the date yet. We’re still discussing it with the UFC but it looks like it will happen at the beginning of April,” he said in Russian.</p>
      <p>Khabib and Ferguson were already slated to fight each other in Brooklyn at UFC 223 in April of last year. The matchup ended up falling through when Ferguson tripped and injured his knee, forcing him out of the fight.</p>
      <p>Khabib went on to fight for the then vacant 155-pound title against Al Iaquinta and won via unanimous decision.</p>
