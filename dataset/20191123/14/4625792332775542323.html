      <p>Former Rep. Katie Hill could return to politics after a sex scandal led to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/katie-hill-to-resign-from-office-amid-house-ethics-investigation-into-relationships-with-staffers">her resignation</a>.</p>
      <p>“I’m not writing anything off. I’m not running any time soon, I can tell you that much,” the California Democrat told CNN on Friday.</p>
      <p>“I’m not giving you a no,” she said.</p>

      <p>Hill said she doesn’t regret resigning, calling it the right decision for her family and staff.</p>
      <p>Hill, 32, announced she was stepping down in October after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation into allegations that the freshman congresswoman engaged in an inappropriate sexual relationship with her legislative director, Graham Kelly. Hill denied the relationship, which is prohibited by House rules, but she admitted to another with a campaign staffer.</p>
      <p>Photos of a nude Hill surfaced before her resignation that showed her <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/photograph-shows-naked-democratic-congresswoman-brushing-hair-of-female-campaign-worker">brushing the campaign staffer’s hair</a>. Photos published later showed the naked congresswoman <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/additional-nude-photos-of-katie-hill-leak-amid-ethics-complaint-about-alleged-affairs">holding a bong</a>.</p>
      <p>Hill blamed her “abusive” estranged husband, Kenny Heslep, of "<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/unfathomable-and-appalling-father-of-katie-hill-hopes-her-husband-is-hit-with-maximum-punishment">driving a smear campaign</a>" against her.</p>
