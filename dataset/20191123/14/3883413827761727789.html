      <p>Mr Pence is the highest-level American to visit the country since US President Donald Trump pulled US forces out of Syria.</p>
      <p>After flying into Erbil, Iraq, Mr Pence met with the President of the Kurdistan region in Iraq and is believed to have had a phone call with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.</p>
      <p>Mr Pence, along with his wife, also visited US troops and served them a traditional meal ahead of next Thursday Thanksgiving Holiday in the United States.</p>

      <p>Mr Pence's trip marks his second visit to the region in five weeks.</p>
      <p>There are currently around 5,000 US troops stationed in Iraq, after the deployment in 2014 to defeat the Islamic State group (IS).</p>
      <p>Last month Turkey launched an offensive into northeastern Syria, following Mr Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from the country.</p>
      <p>They were allied to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces for five years - they fought together to bring down IS in Syria.</p>
      <p>Mr Pence brokered a pause with Ankara to allow time for Kurdish fighters to withdraw.</p>
      <p>Despite a US and Russia-negotiated ceasefire, fighting in different parts of northeast Syria continues, as Turkey-backed fighters advance on areas more than 20 miles south of the border.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, at least three people died and more than 20 were wounded after a <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/car-bomb-explosion-turkey-controlled-northern-syrian-town">car bomb exploded in a Turkey-controlled Syrian town</a>, Tal Abyad.</p>
      <p>The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said the Turkish fighters launched attacks with tanks and artillery on a number of points in Ein Issa, attempting to invade it. "The ceasefire is once again violated by the Turkish army," the SDF said in a tweet.</p>
