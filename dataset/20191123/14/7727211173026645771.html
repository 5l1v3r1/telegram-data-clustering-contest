      <p>A dog owner is warning people with pets to get rid of a common household item, after her dog was poisoned.</p>
      <p>Many of us use diffusers to keep our homes smelling nice, but some of the scents wafting around the room can make dogs very ill.</p>
      <p>Marianne Whyte from New Zealand has taken to social media to issue an urgent warning after her pup was poised by an oil diffuser - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/dog-owners-urgent-warning-after-20935598">reports Mirror Online.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157052164917983&amp;set=a.46153017982&amp;type=3">In a post on Facebook</a> that has been shared hundreds of thousands of times, she said: "Saturday night I got home late and my dog didn't recognise me. Being a nanny, I thought I woke him up and he was having a night terror.</p>
      <p>"Sunday he was still acting weird.</p>
      <p>"I realised that I had been running my new diffuser and decided to turn it off. Sunday afternoon he was feeling better."</p>

      <p>However the next day, the dog sitter informed Marianne the dog had refused to come out from under the bed.</p>
      <p>When she returned home from work, her beloved pet once again seemed to not recognise her.</p>
      <p>She continued: "I took him to the emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.</p>
      <p>"Thankfully the test showed that his liver was ok, but we weren't out of the woods yet. He was given fluids under his skin to get the toxins out.</p>
      <p>"The vet and the poison control are saying that they see these cases often now that the popularity of essential oil is growing.</p>

      <p>"Please make sure that the essential oils you are burning are not toxic for your pets."</p>
      <p>Marianne went on to share a long list of the oils dog owners should avoid, they were:</p>

      <p>Many thanked her for sharing and said they had no idea they shouldn't be using the oils.</p>
      <p>One person wrote: "Thanks for sharing Marianne. I had no idea about this."</p>
      <p>Another said: "Thanks for making me aware, I didn't think about this danger."</p>
      <p>Someone else pointed out that some of the oils could cause issues for humans as well.</p>
      <p>They said: "Some of these oils are quite toxic to humans too. They should only be used and administered by a qualified aromatherapist. It is disturbing that such diffusers are being sold cheaply in some budget stores without adequate warnings in place."</p>
