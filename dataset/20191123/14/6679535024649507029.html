      <h3>Mr. Sharad Pawar claimed Mr. Ajit Pawar did not have the support of adequate MLAs.”Ajit Pawar took the two lists of MLAs from party office claiming those were support letters. Those signs were for party’s internal programme,” he said at a joint press meet with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Echoing Mr. Sharad Pawar, Mr. Thackeray said, “this is shameful what is happening in the name of democracy.” Hitting out at the BJP for “splitting a party,” Mr. Thackeray dared his former ally to try these tactics with the Shiv Sena.</h3>
