      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:52:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury's</a> has doubled the cost of its plastic bags to 20p in a move that has left shoppers furious.</p>
      <p>The supermarket giant said it has increased the price as part of an effort to reduce its plastic footprint and encourage customers to get into the habit of re-using their bags.</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's said there is an incentive to cut plastic use by more than 50 per cent in five years, with the profits going to good causes.</p>
      <p>It said the 20p price is "fair" but shoppers who were angry over the move claimed it was "daylight robbery" and accused the supermarket of "profiting from forgetfulness".</p>

      <p>A number of customers told how they had no idea the price had increased as of this week until they got home and checked their receipt.</p>
      <p>A shopper wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "Sainsbury’s bags have been increased from 10p to 20p. Why? Only noticed when I checked the receipt when I got home."</p>
      <p>Shoppers have been left furious as Sainsbury's has doubled the cost of its plastic bags to 20p in a move dubbed 'day light robbery' and 'profiting from forgetfulness'.</p>
      <p>Another customer wrote: "Sainsbury’s plastic bags have stayed the exact same since they became 5p so SOMEONE needs to tell me why their bags are now 20p?"</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "I get ‘saving the planet’. So offer a paper bag alternatively at 10p, stop profiteering from my forgetfulness!"</p>
      <p>Another complained: “Guessing they saw Morrisons get away with it and decided they wanted a bit of that action too!”</p>
      <p>And another added: "You're right, you will cut Sainsbury's plastic consumption as I wont be shopping there anymore."</p>
      <p>Sainsbury's wrote back to customers, saying: "This change supports our strategy of reducing, reusing and replacing plastic more.</p>

      <p>"If Sainsbury's witness sales increase, then we'll continue to channel any bag for life profit to supporting good causes."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the supermarket told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10404153/sainsburys-fury-doubling-price-plastic-bags-20p/">Sun:</a> "We think 20p is fair. We’re really hoping it will help reduce our plastic usage."</p>
      <p>Supermarkets axed single use carrier bags in 2015 after the Government introduced a 5p charge.</p>
      <p>Morrisons began charging 30p per bag in August. Asda’s price went from 9p to 15p in July.</p>
      <p>Rival Tesco is still charging 10p for a bag.</p>
      <p>In September, Sainsbury's removed plastic bags from its bakery, fruit and veg aisles and introduced a 30p drawstring carrier.</p>
