      <p>Jose Mourinho doing Jose things: joking with the ball-boys in the tunnel before the game in full view of the television camera, greeting Manuel Pellegrini as if he, Mourinho, were the home manager welcoming an overawed lower league boss on FA Cup third round day. The ball-boys loved every moment of it, and soon so too did Mourinho.</p>
      <p>By half-time Tottenham Hotspur were two goals up, by 50 minutes they should have been four up. Dele Alli, of whom Mourinho had asked the question whether he had been <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/22/jose-mourinho-vows-revive-real-dele-alli-targets-trophies-keep/">replaced by a less talented sibling</a>, played the first half like the classic older brother lauding it over the little ones. Spurs controlled the game for an hour but another ten minutes at the end and West Ham, who were dismal in the first half, might have grabbed a draw.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s team selection on the occasion of the fourth coming of Jose was as expected, with Eric Dier back in the team and a golden front four of Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura, Harry Kane and Dele who all played within a few yards of each other. Dele was everywhere, the best of it an improvised flick with the inside of his left boot as he was falling over backwards on the touchline to play in Son to cross to Moura for the second. Dele had made the first for Son too. Moura missed a simple chance for the third on the counterattack before Harry Kane nodded one in from Serge Aurier’s cross.</p>
      <p>West Ham were dreadful in the first half and many of their support had gone home by the time they rallied in the last 30 minutes. The half-time substitute Michail Antonio scored on 73 minutes and they made a game of it in the final stages. Nevertheless this is a run of five defeats and two draws in their last seven league games. It is Chelsea away next Saturday and Manuel Pellegrini looks like a man on the brink.</p>
      <p>“How s--- must you be, we’re winning away” sang the Spurs fans celebrating their first away win in the league since Fulham in January. In the last of six minutes of time added on, Angelo Ogbonna scored West Ham’s second with barely enough time to re-start the game. It gave Mourinho plenty to think about.   </p>

      <h3>And he's gone</h3>
      <p>Job done for Tottenham and Mourinho this afternoon. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1443">2:43PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Mourinho on Alli</h3>
      <p>I am happy with everyone. But if you ask me about him, then yes.</p>
      <p>I spent a few minutes with him in training and outside the pitch. We were saying the best Dele has to be back. He is too good not to be a fundamental player for Spurs. He is too good not to be one of the best players in the world. He's a fantastic player and today he showed that.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1442">2:42PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Mourinho continues</h3>
      <p>I like the first 60 minutes very much. The most important thing was not to win three or four nil or play wonderfully. The three points were fundamental. </p>
      <p>The boys are happy and that's what I really wanted. I wanted them to be back to happiness.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1441">2:41PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Mourinho speaks</h3>
      <p>I was really happy for one hour. We were playing well. </p>
      <p>The last 20 minutes, fatigue, people coming from national duty, all the emotions of losing a manager and another one comes in. </p>
      <p>Clearly fatigue in last 20 minutes. And also a reaction from a very good team from West Ham</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1425">2:25PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>FULL TIME</h3>
      <p>GAME OFF! Mourinho off to winning ways, the only disappointment will be conceding those two goals.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1424">2:24PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>GOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!</h3>
      <p>West Ham have another goal! A corner is hooked in, Ogbonna hits it on the volley after breaking away from Sanchez, who has switched off the last few minutes, and the ball creeps in past Gazzaniga.</p>
      <p>West Ham 2 Spurs 3</p>
      <p>Game on!</p>

      <h3>90 mins+4 - West Ham 1 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Noble gives Kane a little extra in the tackle, Kane milks it to kill some more time. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>90 mins+2 - West Ham 1 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>West Ham are on all out attack now, the D-pad pushed all the way to the right. Snodgrass puts a brilliant ball into the area but Haller heads the ball down into the ground, not putting enough on it to trouble the goalie.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1418">2:18PM</a>

      <h3>VAR: NO GOAL</h3>
      <p>Rice is well offside. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>GOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!</h3>
      <p>WEST HAM HAVE THE BALL IN THE NET! It's from a corner but it might be offside!</p>

      </p>
      <h3>86 mins - West Ham 1 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Snodgrass has snapped and absolutely goes for Snodgrass off the ball. I don't know why. Kane barges into him and smashes his ribs so Snodgrass reacts by charging at him and picking him up. Really weird, quite funny.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1412">2:12PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>84 mins - West Ham 1 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Sissoko goes on a run up the right wing but gives the ball away in his first involvement, West Ham go on the attack. Kane looks absolutely gubbed but is still running. Spurs defending with everyone behind the ball, West ham looking for a way through.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1410">2:10PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>82 mins - West Ham 1 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Kane hits a free-kick from 30 yards and the home supporters cheer Roberto for saving and catching it. The poor guy. </p>
      <p>Moura is taken off for Sissoko. Interested to see if he goes into midfield or wide.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1407">2:07PM</a>

      <p>Eriksen comes on for Alli, who appears to mouth that 'this is bulls***' as he leaves the pitch. He's really annoyed.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1405">2:05PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>77 mins - West Ham 1 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Roberto might not be able to catch the ball but he can definitely kick it. Goal kicks are launched up the pitch, West Ham not messing about. </p>
      <p>Spurs are passing around and meeting a lot more resistance than earlier in the game.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1401">2:01PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>GOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!</h3>
      <p>ANTONIO HITS BACK!</p>
      <p>
        <b>West Ham 1 Spurs 3</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ac ross into the box, Snodgrass cuts it back, Noble clears it up and finds Antonio for a one-two but Antonio spins and wins space from Alderweireld before launching a shot past the goalkeeper. We could be in for an exciting final push.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1400">2:00PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>73 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Mourinho is having a chat with Eriksen on the bench so we'll probably see him soon. Kane is back on the pitch having passed the concussion test. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1359">1:59PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>70 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Antonio is being cheered by the home fans every time he does something with the ball. Snodgrass has just absolutely launched a free-kick directly into Harry Kane's face/head. There is no way I wouldn't have ducked my head out the way there. He'll be able to see through time after that one and has spent some time on the deck. His brain will be pinging back and forth like it's on a swing. Really brave. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1355">1:55PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>67 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 3</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Harry Kane is now Tottenham's outright third highest goalscorer of all-time with 175 goals, behind only Jimmy Greaves (266) and Bobby Smith (208).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Spurs keeping the ball nicely here but West Ham are giving them freedom of their half to do it. Aurier has just killed Snodgrass, an outright murder, by nutmegging him at halfway. Snoddy won't let him get away with that. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/23/west-ham-vs-tottenham-premier-league-live-score-latest-updates/#update-20191123-1352">1:52PM</a>
      </p>
      <h3>65 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Spurs still not having to try particularly hard to get in behind West Ham. Son wins a corner, which is taken short then lifted into the area by Winks but Antonio blocks. </p>
      <p>Diop is taken off for Sanchez, who is 33 but looks about 24. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>57 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 3</h3>
      <p>Yarmolenko is subbed off after touching the ball 16 times. For a winger, that is truly abysmal. Pretty sure Roberto has punched his own players in the face more often.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>49 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 2</h3>
      <p>Antonio appears to have spent the last few months living in a gym because my god he is massive. He's won a foul from Sanchez wide left and is finally getting West Ham fired up and involved in the match. </p>
      <p>The free-kick is awful and Moura breaks! Son joins for a two v two, Moura runs through on goal and is in the box with only the keeper to beat... but passes across and out for a goal kick! Why didn't he shoot? </p>

      <h3>48 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 2</h3>

      <p>Davies shifts over from left-back to join a central three, the front four attack in a block. Very direct, the midfield are basically there to help defend or recycle the ball to the forwards. Working very well so far but that is also because West Ham haven't arrived yet.</p>

      <h3>Dele Alli is the man</h3>
      <p>Pretty sure I lip read Mourinho going "You're the man!" to Alli after helping setup that second goal. He might also have been going 'he's your man', as in a certain player hasn't been marking the opponent he was supposed to. Both make sense.</p>

      <p>Moura has the ball in the back of the net, sliding in to convert Son's cross from wide left. Alli is brilliant here, falling over and flicking the ball along the line while lying down. Did the ball go out before he flicked it? The replay shows no! Great goal.</p>

      <p>VAR doesn't think so.</p>
      <p>Roberto is off his line again to try and punch the ball away from the free-kick, punches Ogbonna in the face and then jumps like a spider to stop Alli putting the ball in his empty net.</p>
      <p>Ogbonna is receiving treatment from the physio, having been punched in the face by his goalkeeper.</p>

      <h3>39 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 1</h3>
      <p>Since that goal, Alli has taken a shot from 30 yards which fizzed past the far post and Spurs fans are singing. The game hasn't been great so far, very patient and measured, but it might be picking up. Fredericks has caught Son with a late slide tackle, crunching through his ankle. He's booked for it and Son is down in a lot of pain.</p>

      <p>Dele Alli wins the ball from Diop, threads a pass into Son who does a stepover and accelerates past Diop before shooting at an angle. Roberto is awful at goalkeeping. Well, not awful, but he's not Premier League level. The ball goes straight through him. I feel bad slagging him off to be honest.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>36 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Alli wins the ball well, nutmegs a defender, and then hooks a massive long ball towards Son. Diop just blocks him out of it until Roberto can come and smother it.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>34 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Rice is fully cuddling Dier next to the goalkeeper and it's hard to work out how that isn't a foul. Winks puts in a series of crosses towards Roberto, knowing that he'll either make a mess of it or try and punch away. Shockingly, Roberto punches away, it falls to Alderweireld and he tries to have a couple of stabs at shooting. Both are blocked. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>32 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Haller takes a dreadful touch and gives a throw-in straight back to Spurs. He's been awful/I'd forgotten he was even playing.</p>
      <p>Spurs players are standing static off the ball so whenever they're trying to get forward there are no options. It's very annoying to watch. Move! </p>
      <p>

      <h3>29 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Eric Dier puts a pass straight out for a throw. Another player not having his best game so far. I reckon if Mourinho could he'd put this team in a bag and shake them up. </p>
      <p>The West Ham fans are cheering - ironically - Roberto's every touch. That'll make him feel nice.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>27 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Anderson is in behind the defence! It's a great ball over the top, he can run at goal, gets to the box and then moves inside and loses possession with a poor pass to Haller. West Ham seem half asleep at times. </p>
      <p>

      <p>Kane presses Fredericks into the corner but then clearly fouls him, meaning he's just wasted a lot of energy for absolutely no reason. </p>
      <p>Son and Moura have swapped wings, presumably because Son is actually defending behind the ball, which will help Aurier out.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>23 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>

      <p>Yarmolenko chips a hopeful ball into the area, Aurier climbs all over Snodgrass and knocks him to the floor but the referee doesn't see a foul. Could absolutely have been a penalty.</p>
      <p>It really does feel like this game is split into defence and attack. It's really slow whenever the defenders have the ball and much quicker up the other end, as you might imagine.</p>
      <p>Son takes a chance to run inside and launches a shot towards the top corner - it's going in! Roberto dives and pushes it away! He could probably have caught it if feeling brave. A ball to the back post for Moura is then headed well wide. He's not having a great game so far.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>17 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>I realise it's early but Lucas Moura and Jose Mourinho are definitely going to fall out. He's been slow to get back and defend every single time West Ham have gone beyond the half way line so far, not really working with any intensity to try and win the ball back. Good luck pal. </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>14 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Winks curls the ball in, about three Spurs players are offside, Roberto comes off his line and tries to catch the ball as Sanchez goes to head it. He is a bombscare of a goalkeeper. What's he thinking? Sanchez is clearly flying towards him to head it but Roberto looks away as he collides into the defender, also trying to catch it?! Very strange. Not sure what Pellegrini sees in him.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>12 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Pellegrini looks to be changing things already, swapping from a 4-1-4-1 to a 4-2-3-1, pulling Noble back alongside Rice. Kane wins a free-kick wide of the box and Diop is booked even though Kane has pulled him to the ground. That's an absolutely ridiculous decision and Diop is now suspended for West Ham's next game. </p>

      </p>
      <h3>10 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Spurs give the ball away, Moura just stands and watches West Ham run up the pitch and Kane is the only one to chase back in order to win the ball back. Mourinho won't be impressed with that from Moura.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>9 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>West Ham finally get into the Spurs half but their passing is slow... and then all of a sudden Yarmolenko is wide right with space to cross. He whips a ball to the back post... and there are players ready to attack it! Gazzaniga catches a header put straight at him. That could so easily have been a goal.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>7 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>West Ham can't even get on the ball here, Spurs absolutely dominating them early on. Kane gets in behind the defence yet again but his low ball across the box is collected and he was offside anyway. West Ham haven't turned up at all, no intensity, no great desire to get in possession... this is easy for Spurs so far.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>5 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Serge Aurier puts Felipe Anderson in the bin with a little Cruyff turn on the right wing, disguising a pass back to his defenders before running with the ball.</p>
      <p>And Harry Kane has scored! Clearly offside so I'm not getting all enthusiastic but signs that Spurs' setup is working. That setup is a 4-2-3-1, with a back six and a forward four attacking in a narrow shape.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>2 mins - West Ham 0 Spurs 0</h3>
      <p>Two minutes in and Jose Mourinho still hasn't scowled or said anything news worthy or run onto the pitch or done anything. Spurs are passing patiently around their own half before the front four run with the ball at the defence.</p>

      <p>"This is new. Jose's warm-ups were pretty generic so this is new," says Joe Cole, who would know. Seems like a pretty standard 4 v 4 to me, designed to get players threading forward passes to the static players either side of the box. </p>

      <blockquote>I have to admit yes.  Even if I wanted I could not change the style of play (at Spurs). I like their style of play, it's adapted to the types of player they have. There are clubs that are better than others in creating conditions for young players. Every manager wants to play young players. Everyone wants. Young players with potential will have opportunities to get in the first team.</blockquote>

      <p>Hello! Welcome to our liveblog and before we do anything else, let's listen to Jose Mourinho. You can just read, I'll transcribe.</p>
      <blockquote>It's a bit of everything. motivation they always had, sometimes people think when results are not good there is something related to motivation but that's not the case. They are good professionals, they try their best and that's what they're going to do. Tactically not big changes, little important things that we think can help them to get our objectives. Basically it's a combination of everything. Vertonghen is almost there but not yet, tomorrow will be the first day he joins the group so maybe not to the Champions League match but I believe in one week he can join us. Davinson joined very late from his Colombian match but we trust him.  It's not just about continuity, the match is very important, our future is very important, I need to understand what it is in Christian's mind or heart. We have to make the right decision for the club.  This two days was more about ideas than to work so let's see if we can find happiness.</blockquote>
