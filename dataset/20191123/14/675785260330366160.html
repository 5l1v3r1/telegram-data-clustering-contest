      <h1>Helen Flanagan claps back at troll who criticised her 'honest mum' moaning</h1>
      <h2>The Coronation Street star was sent abuse by an angry Instagram follower - but she didn't take the criticism lying down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:15:21+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Helen Flanagan hit back at one of her fans after they criticised her for complaining about her own children.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/helen-flanagan">The 29-year-old Coronation Street star</a> lashed back after one follower grew tired of her repeatedly blaming her stresses on her two children.</p>
      <p>Helen has two daughters with her 30-year-old footballer boyfriend, Celtic winger Scott Sinclair - with four-year-old daughter Matilda and second daughter Delilah, born in June 2018.</p>
      <p>But the soap star found herself under attack after complaining about her offspring on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> Stories.</p>

      <p>“Stop ranting about ur kids!” the disgruntled follower wrote in a direct message that Helen later shared for all to see.</p>
      <p>“Buckle up and get on with it!!! There are some people who are unable to conceive then u have people like urself moaning!” the angry follower continued.</p>
      <p>“It’s part of the process get on with it and stop RANTING! Which is what your doing,” the follower angrily concluded.</p>

      <p>But Helen did not take kindly to the message and hit back at the follower - before sharing the exchange for all to see.</p>
      <p>“Actually. I am honest on my instagram so other mums can identity with me and feel less on their own,” she replied.</p>
      <p>“I am supportive of other women,” she added - while adding to the screen grab of the exchange: “Direct messages like this. I have friends very close to me who have struggled to conceive.”</p>

      <p>The fiery exchange appeared to have been ignited after Helen shared two updates about her daughters testing her patience and causing her to stress eat.</p>
      <p>“To get an peace at the moment I have to lock myself in the toilet… any other mums do the same?” the TV star mused as she shared a photo of herself online.</p>
      <p>“Delilah screamed so much in the car today I was so stressed I had to stop at Costa drive thru and inhale this,” she wrote in a second story post alongside a photo of a muffin.</p>
      <p>However, the argument with the fan may have hit a nerve as she later shared a snap of her eldest daughter with the caption: “I’m not perfect but I love you so darling.”</p>
