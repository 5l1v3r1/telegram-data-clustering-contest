      <h1>Doctor Who Series 12 Trailer Teases Return of Cybermen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:11:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Cardona</a></address>
      <p>The BBC has released a trailer for the next installment of Jodie Whittaker's turn on <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a>.</p>
      <p>The entire Team TARDIS is back, from Graham, Yaz and Ryan to Whittaker’s Thirteenth Doctor, and they have plenty of exciting new adventures ahead of them. Whittaker began her tenure as Doctor Who in Season 11, which made a point of not featuring any of the sci-fi series’ classic villains. However, the new trailer shows this ban is gone in Series 12. In fact, it teases the return of the Judoon, the Racnoss and the fearsome Cybermen.</p>

      <p>The new season of <i>Doctor Who</i> is said to begin with a two-part holiday special airing New Year’s Day. However, the trailer only confirms Season 12 will be coming early 2020. The official start date has therefore yet to be revealed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/doctor-who-sonic-screwdriver-pointing-habit-50th/">Doctor Who</a> stars Jodie Whittaker as the thirteenth iteration of the titular Time Lord.
