      <h1>Primark issues statement as excited rumours of Tamworth store circulate</h1>
      <h2>Shoppers have moved to social media to reveal their excitement over the speculative plans for Ventura Park - but nothing has been confirmed by Primark</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:48:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:48</time> by <a rel="author">Stephanie Balloo, https://www.facebook.com/MissBalloo/</a></address>
      <p>Primark has responded to frenzied speculation that an announcement is imminent on a new store rumoured to be opening in Tamworth.</p>
      <p>Social media rumours - not citing any proof - that the budget fashion chain would be moving into Ventura Park in the near future have sparked excitement in the town.</p>
      <p>It was said to be taking over the former Matalan unit - with many happy shoppers welcoming the idea.</p>
      <p>JaymeLeigh Silver said: "yesssss! Love the place and don’t care what anyone else thinks."</p>

      <p>Jo Cope Davis added: "Really hope they do bring a Primark here..people can call the store down all they like but fab store for kids clothes especially the way my daughter grows..</p>
      <p>"Cheap and cheerful store for those of us who refuse to pay triple the price elsewhere when a child grows so quick."</p>
      <p>But others were sent into a panic over the potential traffic problems caused by the alleged opening.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/juleskirkham">O</a>ne said: "Traffic is already a nightmare there despite the changes to add exits on two sites, let's hope people learn the road lanes a bit better before someone dies if the traffic increases due to Primark!"</p>
      <p>However, the social media speculation has not been confirmed by Primark, with no sign of the potential store listed as one of their 19 new stores either.</p>
      <p>A Primark spokesperson said when approached by BirminghamLive: "Unfortunately, we don't have immediate plans to locate a new store in Tamworth in the near future."</p>
      <p>BirminghamLive has also approached Ventura Park for a comment.</p>
      <p>Primark has, however, confirmed it is opening 19 new stores in the coming year - after a successful launch of  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/primark-birmingham-postcode-opening-times-16111187">the world's biggest shop in Birmingham</a> .</p>
