      <h1>Dolph Ziggler explains why WWE wouldn't let him troll fans</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The Show Off talks to Mirror Sport about his new tag team ahead of Survivor Series</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:14:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author">Danny Stone</a></address>
      <p>Dolph Ziggler is one of the longest standing superstars in WWE, yet his future with the company has often been questioned.</p>
      <p>After time away from the ring, the Cleveland-born 'Show Off' is now back working full time for the sports entertainment giant.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old has now teamed up with Robert Roode to breathe fresh life into the WWE tag team division ahead of Survivor Series.</p>
      <p>The former world champion sat down with Mirror Sport's Danny Stone to discuss this new partnership, his true feelings about the roles he's played for the company and how his sideline as a stand-up comic helps his wrestling career.</p>

      <h4>You have a new alliance with Robert Roode. How did the tag team come together and where does it rank in your personal tag team history?</h4>
      <p>We're really just getting going. So I can't say we're the greatest of all time because we've only really had a couple of weeks of working together. It's a weird thing, I don't have tons of people that I text with on a regular basis, or I'm in a group chat with. But over the course of the last 14 years, people that have been trying every possible outlet to be successful in the business, I've somewhat gravitated towards.</p>
      <p>Whether they're doing something on the outside, whether they're doing everything they can to be great in WWE. Whether it's someone like The Miz, or Zack Ryder, and those are two prime examples over the past few years, constantly doing projects outside to make themselves better and more important for the show, hoping to get a break on the show.</p>
      <p>When Bobby Roode shows up from NXT, of course he fought me(!) because that's what you do when you show up from NXT, which I get. But immediately I recognised, he understands our style and what's happening, he's really smart and has a brain for this, I think this is going to be a blast, and it was. We became friends and started texting, and there's only a handful of those people that on a regular basis I text.</p>
      <p>It's because they are so good and constantly trying to get better. So the fact that we became a team, it wasn't like 'here’s what's going to happen, the seed is going to be planted and in six months you guys are going to be a team', that doesn't happen too often in WWE. We were thrown together and told 'you two are two of the best, we're putting you together to make this entire division better' and I went 'say no more, we got it'.</p>
      <p>We haven't done a ton of stuff but the few things we have, whether it's turmoil tournaments or different things, it's pretty great to know someone next to you isn't just thinking 'I'm on a team with Dolph, so I can hang out and do whatever'. Bob's doing his own thing but when we team up and work together, we both know how the match should be, we both have that same psychology and years of experience and we're like 'no no no, we got this, just listen to us and you're going to come out looking great'.</p>

      <h4>A couple of years ago you teased various WWE superstar's entrances. Did you get a say in which ones were used and were there any you wanted to use but didn't get a chance to?</h4>
      <p>It's hard to say because for the longest time I've been a wrestling fan above everything. I've watched the old tapes, but at the time, I really didn't want to be doing it because I didn't feel like we were surprising anyone. We'd have me come out and say 'now I’m gonna trick you' and then I would go back and come out again.</p>
      <p>So, I think the whole point of that would be to, anytime during the two-three hour show, hear The Undertaker's music and think 'well, he's not supposed to be here! Oh, it's Dolph' and I'd say 'you idiots have based your whole life on an entrance theme that's on you, you should be enjoying… and so on…' That's what I thought. I didn't understand it and I fought against it a little bit and they told me 'no'.</p>
      <p>So I didn't really love doing that because I knew we weren't getting that part of the 'up' into the 'down', the 'now they're mad at me!' So it was like 'urgh, what are you doing?'. So, had we done that to the proper trolling heights that we should have, it would have been fun.</p>
      <p>Doing someone else's entrance is fun to screw with fans or to prove a point, but I’m passed the point where I'm like 'wouldn't it be cool if I came out as Triple H, gee that would be cool'. No, I'm someone who has wanted to make their own mark for about 12 years in a row now, so I have no interest in going 'wouldn't that be neat'. Perhaps someone new and young, perhaps that could be a dream of theirs.</p>

      <h4>You have performed comedy to crowds across the US. How does it differ, performing in front of the WWE universe, to dealing with a comedy show audience?</h4>
      <p>It's really interesting. Of course, if you're doing a TV production, you've got to know where the cameras are, your marks, you have to know the blocking of everything. That's another thing with Bobby Roode and myself, we know what to do and where we need to be and people will listen to and follow us.</p>
      <p>When it comes to a comedy show, a lot of times it's 300 people packed into a room. You get to play around with them and do some improv and to talk to somebody. With WWE if we're doing a TV show there's, say, 10,000 people there. Behind the camera, there's millions watching and you have to play to them.</p>
      <p>So, it's interesting. You can still connect with someone. Something I heard Eddie Guerrero did a long time ago was find someone, when you're getting beat down or beating someone down, and lock eyes, and use them to be like 'help me!' or 'this is because of you!', either way. They think they're in it in the TV, they're with it for real, so you can use that and focus on the TV screen.</p>
      <p>The improv can be handy too. People get hurt; things go wrong. Things go from 15 minutes to 90 seconds to get something done and it's like, okay, go. You have to be able to improv and that's something I excel at in WWE and in comedy.</p>

      <h4>You've been doing some political punditry in the United States. Have you followed British politics? If so, perhaps you could share your views on Brexit, or the General Election?</h4>
      <p>It's been really interesting to hear people's voices heard, I think that's a big deal in the united states. People see things happening for years, and want to get involved. Whether they're resisting or voting for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> , or doing anything, just seeing young people be involved is pretty exciting and good news for the future, I think.</p>
      <h4>You were involved in one of the earliest incarnations of NXT, with Byron Saxton as your rookie. With NXT now attacking the main roster in the run-up to Survivor Series do you perhaps look at the invasion fondly and think 'I helped build this?'.</h4>
      <p>I don't look at it that way at all. It was a much different NXT. It would have become this thing without me anyway. It was fun to be on that show and what is that, eight years ago!? I don't even know. But for the WWE to have the confidence in me to go and train someone else, to be a part of this new show, constantly be talking and doing things, it shows where a bunch of us stood with WWE. I mean it's such a different animal now, they're their own brand, a unique thing because they have their own stars. It was cool to be there at the beginning though.</p>

      <h4>Taking you further back, do you have any memories of your first televised match?</h4>
      <p>Man, I don't know. So Spirit Squad stuff, yes. But one of the first things that popped into my head was being a caddy for Chavo Guerrero. The whole time throughout this match, I was just waiting to go – he was wrestling Shelton Benjamin – I was going 'something happens, I have this golf club, I gotta make this happen, and I gotta break it, and I can't half break this, it's gotta break, it's gotta break'. They had a match and I slid in there and smashed it, I broke that thing so hard, it would have shattered glass, it was funny. I remember being so nervous.</p>
      <p>Also, I was in a mixed tag match at Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) it was my first time ever wrestling, so not WWE but under my own name. I was waiting to just tag in. I thought 'tag in and grab his arm and then figure it out', I was so nervous, just not wanting to mess up and wanting to look like I'd been there before, I got in, grabbed his arm, did something and tagged right out. So I thought to myself, 'okay, next time, make it look a little bit bigger!'</p>
      <h4>You mention the Spirit Squad, are you still in touch with them? I heard one moved to Israel?</h4>
      <p>I don't know, who moved to Israel!? Every once in a while, I see on social media, or text once in a while two or three of the guys. The only one I can't get a hold of is Mitch. Maybe he's the one that moved!</p>
      <h4>Is it true that you know American Sign Language?</h4>
      <p>I took six semesters in college, a long time ago, but when it comes to signings or WrestleMania and you see all these fans, instead of having them write something down, I can actually communicate with them and do a couple of things here and there. I'm right at the bottom but I have a work book that's in my backpack and I try and get a couple of words each day to get back to it.</p>
      <h4>What do you attribute your longevity in the business to?</h4>
      <p>A lot of it is luck because injuries, no matter how good you are, can put you on the sidelines. No matter how good you or your opponent are, you can step on the mat wrong and tear your ACL. So a couple of those add up, and they don't trust you anymore and you can't do certain things.</p>
      <p>But also being able to adjust at all times and being ready to go whether you're being a glorified enhancer talent or someone that's told 'we're going to revamp the entire tag-team division, starting today, with you and this tag partner that you've never wrestled with, and you're going to do 45 minutes tonight and it's going to go on and on, go!' and you can do it and not have them go 'he wasn't really ready for that'.</p>
      <p>You’re always prepared for any possible role. I can talk on TV, I can make it funny, I can do a behind the scenes interview on the fly, I can go talk to investors, to kids, to an anti-bullying rally. You can do all those things, something Miz has made an entire career out of, I can do that, plus the good wrestling.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>You're active on social media but is it fair to say your persona is rather different to WWE?</h4>
      <p>My character is out of my hands and my control a lot of the time at work. They go today you'll have four minutes and you're not talking on the microphone, you're just kicking someone wrestling. So clearly, yes, talking or texting would be a lot different than that. It's fun just to practice jokes and be myself. The most important part of social media is to not take it too seriously.</p>
      <p>A lot of young kids, who only know this world of social media, take it very seriously and base their life on likes. So they have to buy cool shoes and have cool things going on, and say things. If you're getting bullied at school, you're getting bullied at home now too because social media is everywhere, and that is some scary stuff.</p>
      <p>But I've been lucky enough to grow up in an era where we didn't have it. So we use it for work, and I use it to promote shows, and I use it to have fun and zing people who are all snarky anyway (it's the internet, so everyone's snarky) and I won’t be outsnarked on my own page.</p>
      <h4>You had some time away from WWE – what did you learn and what did you bring back with you.</h4>
      <p>I learned s***. I learned that I needed a vacation after 14 years! After about 11/12 years non-stop, and being one of the people like Kofi and Seamus and Miz that did five days a week, every week for a couple of years in a row, and then were doing the rallies and PR.</p>
      <p>I said I've been too lucky with injuries, that fans have now seen me every single Monday or Friday – or whatever our schedule was – I worked 10 years in a row without a break. Miz gets a break to do a crappy movie. Someone else gets one because they get hurt, someone for something else, I thought 'they've seen me so much, I'm taken for granted, there’s no excitement to seeing me 200 times in a row'.</p>
      <p>So I go 'I have to go away'. For a year or two I kept getting told 'sure' and then right as I was getting ready to go, they said 'we need you'. I've never heard 'we need you' more than anything from any other company my whole entire life, but it's so great to hear, to know that I've made an entire career out of them needing me to be here.</p>
