        <b><i>Who’s gonna be the one? Who will fly our flag onstage? </i>Probably this question has been of concern to the managers of the Cypriot broadcaster CyBC for a long time now, as it all seems that we are soon to find out who will succeed Tamta on the stage of our favorite competition. Or do we already know?</b>
      </p>
      <h3>The story behind</h3>
      <p>According to reports from both Cypriot and Greek media, after two powerful female performances, with successful placings on the final scoreboard (<b>Eleni Foureira</b> and <b>Tamta</b>), <b>CyBC</b> was rather desirous of a male artist to represent them in Rotterdam. Despite the initial proposal to rising singer <b>Ian Stratis</b>, things didn’t work out and thus, other names fell on the table.</p>
      <p>Greek TV channel <b>Star</b> also suggests that CyBC had also approached <b>Ivi Adamou</b>, who represented the island of Aphrodite in 2012, with the song <i>La la love</i> and finished in 16th place. However, the famous artist politely rejected the proposal, citing personal and family reasons.</p>

      <p>As a matter of course, their search went on and maybe this time turned out to be lucky for the broadcaster, as many media present the agreement with the young Greek-American artist<b> Sandro Nicolas </b>as an accomplished event, with <b>only the official announcements yet to be made</b>.</p>
      <h3>Who is Sandro Nicolas?</h3>
      <p>An international personality, the 23-year-ola Sandro Nicolas (birth name <b>Alessandro Rütten</b>) was born and raised in Germany to an American father and a Greek mother. The artist is already famous in the country, where he was also highly tipped to take part in their national selection for 2020. Last year, he participated in <b><i>The Voice of Germany</i></b>, where he managed to turn all 4 chairs with <b>Shawn Mendes</b>‘ <i>In my blood</i>. He eventually reached the semi-finals.</p>

      <p>Sandro has again competed at an international level, as he was among the finalists of the <i><b>New Wave Festival 2019</b></i>.</p>

      <p>If this news is confirmed, then the only thing left for him is the selection of the song that he will perform at the <b>Ahoy Arena </b>of Rotterdam. The same reports suggest that CyBC has already shortlisted 5 songs.</p>
      <p>So let’s wait to see if this information is valid and it will be Sandro Nicolas who will represent Cyprus in this year’s competition!</p>

      <h3>Cyprus at Eurovision 2019</h3>
      <p>It was in December 2018 when the Cypriot national broadcaster <b>CyBC</b> officially announced that the Georgian-Greek pop icon <b>Tamta</b> would represent them at the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, with the song <i>Replay</i>. Their entry was penned by the acclaimed Greek-Swedish composer <b>Alex Papaconstantinou</b> and his team.</p>
      <p>Following its release in early March, <i>Replay</i> quickly became a big hit in Cyprus, Greece and other countries. For the 5th time in a row, Cyprus managed to reach the Grand Final, where Tamta finished 13th, scoring 109 points.</p>
