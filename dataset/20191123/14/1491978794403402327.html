      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> has defended his pledge to stay “neutral” in the event of a second Brexit referendum after his position was criticised as indecisive.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-labour-neutral-second-brexit-vote">revealed during a Question Time leaders’ special on Friday that he would not back either side,</a> putting him at odds with senior party figures including John McDonnell, Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry, who have all said they would back remain.</p>
      <p>His decision to take a “neutral stance” on a proposed referendum for a newly negotiated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a> deal if Labour forms a government drew scorn from critics.</p>
      <p>Corbyn’s disclosure – the first time he had clarified his position – came after significant pressure in recent weeks, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> repeatedly pressing him on the issue during their head-to-head debate on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>During a campaign stop in Sheffield on Saturday, Corbyn – a longstanding Eurosceptic as a backbench MP – claimed that his stance represented a sign of “strength and maturity”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to supporters outside an Amazon warehouse in the city, where he was launching the party’s plans to take on “bad bosses” and “tax dodgers”, he said: “I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity.</p>

      <p>“My role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that [a second referendum] is carried out in a fair way, that the offers put are fair, and that I will carry out the result of that referendum.</p>
      <p>“I think this is actually a sensible way forward that actually can bring people together.”</p>
      <p>However, the health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock">Matt Hancock</a>, earlier attacked Corbyn, arguing that his position “won’t wash” with the electorate. He told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge On Saturday programme: “He has actively decided to be indecisive on the biggest issue of the day. It won’t wash with voters.</p>
      <p>“I think it is an absolute disaster. You can’t ask this country to be its prime minister while not having a view on the biggest issue of the day.”</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jo-swinson">Jo Swinson</a> – who is campaigning on a platform to revoke Brexit – also rounded on Corbyn, saying: “To me that is a total absence of leadership. Remainers in this country need a leader, not a bystander.”</p>
      <p>The Labour party’s plan is to negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the EU if it wins next month’s election, and then have a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper. In a Guardian article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/17/corbyn-vows-to-put-sensible-brexit-deal-to-voters-in-referendum">in September</a>, Corbyn indicated that he would stay neutral.</p>
