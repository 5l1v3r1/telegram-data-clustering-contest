      <h1>‘Pakistan Aiming To Disturb Peace And Harmony In The Region Through Kartarpur Corridor’: PoK Activist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:58:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>PoK activist Amjad Mirza, who is living in exile in Glasgow. has said that Pakistan has a devious agenda behind the opening of Kartarpur corridor, <a href="https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/pakistan-aims-to-spread-unrest-through-kartarpur-corridor-says-pok-activist20191123110728/">reports </a><i>Asian News International.</i></p>
      <p>He further claims that the opening of the corridor is an alternative strategy by Pakistan to disturb peace and harmony in the region as the rogue nation has grown desperate after losing area around the Kashmir border.</p>
      <p>"Why has Pakistan taken this decision now? Why have they done it after 73 years? They have done it so because the gateway to Kashmir where they were spreading terrorism is closed now. This has resulted in the Pakistani army, the real ruler of the country, losing confidence among the common people. Through this corridor, they will now use the Khalistani extremists to hamper peace and harmony in Punjab" said Mirza as quoted by ANI.</p>
      <p>The corridor, opened earlier this month, allow Indian pilgrims a visa-free visit to the holy Darbar Sahib.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, he also added that Pakistan is just making anti-India plans and has nobody's welfare in mind.</p>
      <p>Mirza asked "If they care so much for the people then they must open the routes to Ladakh and Kashmir. But they will never do this because people from across the border will meet and mingle with each other."</p>
