        <b>A report by The Nation indicates that the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states have pitched senior PDP members against themselves.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the report, a N3 billion largesse doled out by one of the party's governors to some influential members of the PDP in Abuja has triggered crisis within its fold.</p>
      <p>Already, some aggrieved party members are clamouring for sanctions against the recipients of the said sum.</p>
      <p>The party chieftains were said to have demanded for N6 billion to facilitate the victory of the PDP’s candidates but got N3 billion as advanced payment.</p>

      <p>It was not clear whether the governor in question would be willing to pay the outstanding sum with the party’s loss of the election or demand a refund of the sum already paid.</p>
      <p><i>“The governor who gave out the money is said to be peeved that the party’s National Working Committee has been unduly quiet about the results of the elections,”</i> the report stated.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Bayelsa governor, Seriake Dickson, has described the just concluded governorship election in the state as a military coup.</p>
      <p>Addressing journalists in Yenagoa on Tuesday, November 19, Governor Dickson said the election was a charade and a carefully orchestrated plan to forcefully take over Bayelsa state <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277253-bayelsa-election-a-coup-gov-dickson.html">towards entrenching a one-party system in Nigeria.</a></p>
