      <p><b>Ben Affleck</b> is not falling in love with <b>Ana de Armas</b>, his co-star in the upcoming thriller <i>Deep Water</i>, despite a false report. The two simply aren’t dating. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can correct the claim otherwise.</p>
      <p>“Ben Romancing His Co-Star!” reads a headline in the latest issue of <i><b>Life &amp; Style</b></i>. Affleck and de Armas are currently shooting their film in New Orleans, and according to the magazine’s alleged source, “Things have really heated up” between them. “She’s definitely smitten and, and so is he,” says the anonymous tipster, adding that Affleck has had his eye on the actress ever since he saw her in <i>Blade Runner 2049</i>.</p>
      <p>“She’s one of the main reasons he signed on to do <i>Deep Water</i>,” adds the unknown tipster. <b>Gossip Cop</b> should pause here to note it’s absurd to believe that Affleck chooses movie roles to chase women. The seemingly phony source continues, “Ana is unique and has something very special. They talk about politics and things that are important to them. Even though it’s all still new, it feels like they’ve known each other for years.”</p>
      <p>The untraceable insider goes on to say, “Ana is not you average Hollywood actress – and definitely not like any girl Ben has dated. He’s happy. He looks forward to going to work every day, and she’s the reason.”</p>
      <p>It should first be mentioned, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted <i>Woman’s Day</i> back in August for wrongly reporting that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ben-affleck-ana-de-armas-dating/">Affleck was secretly dating de Armas</a>. That article emerged well before the two even started working together. It was concocted just after the news was announced that they’d be co-starring in <i>Deep Water</i>. At the very least, the two are actually on set together this time around. The romance rumors, however, remain untrue.</p>
      <p>Despite what <i>Life &amp; Style</i>’s so-called “source” claims, <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with Affleck’s rep, who laughed off the rumors he’s dating de Armas. This story was invented simply because the two are co-starring in a movie together and pictures recently emerged of them shooting a scene.</p>
      <p>Of course, the unreliable outlet has already proven to have little insight into the actor’s love life. Earlier this year, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the magazine for making up a story about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ben-affleck-charlize-theron-halle-berry-date/">Affleck’s friends wanting him to date Charlize Theron or Halle Berry</a>. That ridiculous article read more like fan fiction than journalism.</p>
      <p><i>Life &amp; Style</i> is also the same tabloid that has printed several untrue stories about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-renew-vows-false/">Affleck getting back together with Jennifer Garner</a>. One of those reports even said the two planned to renew their vows. Shortly after we corrected the story, the exes finalized their divorce. The publication seems to come up with its narratives on a whim.</p>
