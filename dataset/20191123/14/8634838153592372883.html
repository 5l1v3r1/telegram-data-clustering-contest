        <b>Gatundu South MP has come under fire from Kirinyaga leaders after he harshly criticised the county's Governor Anne Waiguru over sentiments she made while at <i>Citizen TV</i>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Led by the area's Jubilee Party Chairman Mureithi Kang'ara, the leaders stated that Kuria should understand that he was elected to serve the people of Gatundu South and not to be the prefect of the entire Mt Kenya region.</p>
      <p>Kanga'ra explained to the legislator that Kirinyaga residents elected the governor and knew what she had done for them, urging the MP to back off. </p>

      <p>"We the people of Kirinyaga voted for her and we will call her out when we feel she is not working for us, so Kuria should know his place," Kang'ara remarked.</p>
      <p>The Jubilee official further claimed that Kuria lacked regard for other leaders and informed him that for him to be accorded the respect he deserved, he had to respect others.</p>
      <p>Kanga'ra's response came after Kuria had poked holes at Waiguru's theory that grievances expressed by Mt Kenya residents were not unique to the region but were experienced by Kenyans countrywide. </p>
      <p>Waiguru was speaking on <i>Citizen TV</i>'s <i>Newsnight </i>host Waihiga Mwaura asked whether the issues alleged by Mt Kenya leaders were real.</p>
      <p>Kuria did not take the words kindly and offered to take the governor to a tour of her own county to show her the issues her people were facing.</p>
