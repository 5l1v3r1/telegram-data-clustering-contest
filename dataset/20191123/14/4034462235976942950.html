      <h1>There's Great News About The Audi RS6 Avant</h1>
      <h2>If you covet an RS6, getting one might not be too difficult.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:00:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>The Audi stand at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show is a dreamland for automotive enthusiasts. This year, Audi showed off a total of nine new models including all-new Audi Sport models like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/rs-q8">RS Q8</a>, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/rs7">RS7</a> Sportback, and the long-awaited <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/rs6">RS6 Avant</a>. This marks the first time Audi has ever offered the RS6 Avant in the US market and the first time the RS6 has been sold here in any capacity since 2003.</p>
      <p>Sitting down with Anthony Foulk, Senior Product Manager at Audi of America, we had a chance to inquire about how Audi plans to allocate such a highly anticipated model throughout its US dealer network. Even though the RS6 won't arrive at dealerships until next year, Foulk had a pretty detailed explanation of how customers can order one.</p>

      <p>"Right now there are really two things I'd recommend. First, go on our website and there's what we would call a hand raiser area. Put your name on there," he began. "It's literally to move people down the consideration pipeline for RS6. At some point, you'll be told when it's time to go order. We are trying to get a reservation [process] in time for launch but I can't confirm that happening at this point. You can always go to your dealer and say 'I'd like to get on the list for an RS6.'"</p>
      <p>Since this is a niche model, we asked Foulk if dealerships would be able to order units of the RS6 to keep as inventory, or if they will be special order only. "It depends on the demand at the beginning," Foulk explained. "Nobody's ordering anything yet. The car is coming next year. There are no orders going into a system yet because our factory system doesn't order that far out."</p>

      <p>So as of right now, it's still too early to secure your allocation for an RS6 but according to Foulk, you may not have to be in a rush. We told Foulk about a friend of ours who is currently considering an RS6 and asked if Audi is only planning to build a limited number of them for the US. "Neither of them [also referring to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/a6-allroad">A6 Allroad</a>] are limited production," Foulk answered. "If people keep coming to the dealer and ordering these, we will keep making them."</p>
      <p>Do you hear that wagon lovers? Audi will keep building these cars and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/audi-has-a-message-for-everyone-who-demanded-the-rs6-avant">all you have to do is buy them</a>.</p>
      <p>Foulk also explained why now was the perfect time to finally bring the RS6 to the US. "The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/a4-allroad">A4 allroad</a> was such a success for us, most of our Avant customers moved over to it. It's really become a staple for Audi and we saw the opportunity to bring the A6 [allroad] back in," he explained.</p>

      <p>"When you look at the A6 Avant, that body style, you can bring the allroad. Then, once you've done that body style, you can do the RS," Foulk outlined. "We have the drivetrain, the V8 bi-turbo coming in the RS7 and RS Q8 as well."</p>
      <p>Basically, Audi had to certify the wagon body style for US crash tests while also certifying the V8 engine for emissions. By having the A6 allroad coming a the same time as the RS7 and RS Q8, Audi was easily able to justify offering the RS6 because the body style and engine were both coming to the US anyway.</p>
      <p>"We've been trying to get that car here for years and years and years. It's just, we needed enough of a center of gravity of volume to be able to make it financially viable," Foulk explained. The RS6 probably would not have come to the US without the A6 allroad and vice versa. Frankly, we are happy to finally have them both back.</p>
