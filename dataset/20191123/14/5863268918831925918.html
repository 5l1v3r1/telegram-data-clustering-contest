      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – Actor Ali Rehman Khan found himself in hot water after social media roasted him for shouting at an employee at a famous fast food company, Dunya News reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>In a leaked video, Ali Rehman can be seen screaming at a cashier and says, “Do you know who I am? Have you ever seen me on TV? You are an employee and your job is to follow my instructions. I am paying.”</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the cashier tries to calm down the actor and behaves politely. The reason behind Ali Rehman Khan getting upset is still not clear. Furthermore, it is also obscure whether the occurrence was real or a publicity stunt.</p>
