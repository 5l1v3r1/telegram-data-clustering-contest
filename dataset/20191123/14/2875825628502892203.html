      <h1>West Ham 2-3 Tottenham: 5 talking points as Jose Mourinho enjoys winning start</h1>
      <h2>Son Heung-Min set Tottenham on their way to victory before Lucas Moura and Harry Kane made the points safe at the London Stadium on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:24:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho toasted his first game in charge of Spurs by wiping out <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Goals from Son Heung-Min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane gave the north Londoners their first away win for 11 months.</p>
      <p>It also lifted Spurs from 14th to sixth ahead of this afternoon’s 3pm kick-offs.</p>
      <p>Defeat for the Hammers piled the pressure on boss Manuel Pellegrini who is now without a win in seven. Keeper Roberto endured yet another nightmare afternoon in goal with a poor performance.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> ’s lack of concentration in the second half saw Hammers substitute Michail Antonio pull one back in the with 17 minutes before Angelo Ogbonna added a late consolation.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s new side saw out the win for a major confidence boost ahead of their Champions League tie at home to Olympiakos on Tuesday night.</p>

      <h3>Lift-off</h3>
      <p>The curious thing about this thumping win in Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge was that Spurs didn’t actually play that well.</p>
      <p>Dele Alli did. Son Heung-Min did. But then he normally is a seven or eight out of ten. Harry Kane did his job, scoring yet again.</p>
      <p>But despite his goal Lucas Moura, for example, was light years away from the speedy, scheming forward that ripped Ajax apart in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>He and his confidence will take some time to heal after his time on the fringes this season under Mauricio Pochettino. Serge Aurier clearly had licence to go forward. Ben Davies on the left did not.</p>
      <p>Ring-rusty Eric Dier misplaced a number of passes. Spurs were side feeling their way back to form.</p>
      <p>Their decision-making at times was poor. They were lucky to come up against a poor, poor side. Pellegrini is a man under pressure.</p>

      <h3>Rocky Roberto</h3>
      <p>West Ham’s understudy for keeper Lukasz Fabianski has been poor for weeks with his displays against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> particularly bad.</p>
      <p>Now his lack of quality was on show for a televised audience. Hammers fans must have watched through their fingers. Spurs fans must have been stunned that their side didn’t put him under more pressure before Son Heung Min opened the scoring nine minutes before half time.</p>
      <p>The goals from Burnley and Newcastle came mostly from set-pieces where Roberto is simply hopeless. Here, the Spanish 33-year-old made only a cursory dive for Son’s goal - a shot straight at him.</p>
      <p>West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini and his Director of Football Mario Husillos remain adamant that he will come good.</p>
      <p>By then, however, West ham - fifth after beating <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in September - could be deep in relegation trouble.</p>

      <h3>Pellegrini under pressure</h3>
      <p>No charm, no charisma and no Plan B when the going gets tough.</p>
      <p>His cv - having done well at Malaga and won the title with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - is good for West Ham but there is so little else that is.</p>
      <p>Just as with City, he will leave eventually having built no real, lasting relationship with the club or their fans.</p>
      <p>But with an extremely healthy bank balance. The Hammers’ keeper might be bad but Pellegrini’s job is to provide protection for him.</p>
      <p>That he failed here is a big part of the reason why Spurs had it so easy.</p>

      <h3>Alli back in form</h3>
      <p>Actually, we’ve seen the real Dele Alli a few times this season. His goals against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> suggested a return to form long before Spurs chairman Daniel Levy picked up the red phone to Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The Special One knows how to give a little love, however, and to make players feel special as he has done this week.</p>
      <p>Alli responded with an assist for Son and a piece of skill to keep the ball in play that contributed hugely to Tottenham’s second.</p>
      <p>The big job now will be for him to maintain his form and to add some more goals.</p>

      <h3>Moura makes mark</h3>
      <p>He’s been unhappy ever since his hat-trick against Ajax in that incredible Champions League comeback last season was rewarded with a place on the bench for the final.</p>
      <p>What seemed a good relationship with Pochettino quickly deteriorated. Mourinho’s claim to have wanted to buy him will have gone down well.</p>
      <p>Moura’s celebration suggested his goal was just what he and his confidence needed.</p>
