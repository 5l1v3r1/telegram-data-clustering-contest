      <h1>Nigeria’s GDP picks up to 2.28% y/y in Q3-19</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:11:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/csl-stockbrokers/" target="_blank">CSL Stockbrokers</a></address>
      <p>The <b>National Bureau of Statistics</b> (NBS) reported that Nigeria’s economy expanded by 2.28% y/y in Q3-2019 from 1.94%y/y in Q2-2019. The <b>GDP growth</b> in Q3 represents a 47bps increase when compared with the 1.81% y/y achieved in the same period of 2018. The Q3 GDP growth is also 17bps higher that Q2-2019 revised growth of 2.12% y/y (previously; 1.94% y/y).</p>
      <p><b>The uptick in the country’s growth</b> momentum was supported by a 1.85% y/y growth in the non-oil sector- the largest part of Nigeria’s economy. However, its contribution to the total GDP moderated to 90.23% from 91.02% in Q2-2019. On the other hand, growth in the oil-sector moderated slightly by 68bps to 6.49% y/y from 7.17% y/y in Q2-2019 while the sector’s contribution to the total GDP rose to 9.77% from 8.98% in the second quarter.</p>
      <p><b>The uptick in non-oil sector</b> growth was on the back of a slight improvement in output from the real sectors (i.e. Agriculture, Mining &amp; Quarrying, Manufacturing and Construction). Overall, the real sectors grew by 2.8% y/y in the review period compared to a growth rate of 2.3% y/y recorded in Q2-2019.</p>
      <p>All the components of the real sector, save for Mining &amp; Quarrying, recorded an improvement in the quarter as the agricultural sector grew by 2.28% y/y (Q2-2019: 1.79% y/y), manufacturing sector grew by 1.10% y/y (Q22019: -0.13% y/y) while the construction sector grew by 2.37% y/y (Q2-2019: 0.67% y/y). In contrast, output growth from the mining &amp; quarrying sub-sector softened in real terms to 6.19% y/y in the review period from 7.00% y/y in Q2-2019.</p>
      <p><b>Besides the improvements</b> in the real sectors, the transportation and storage sub-sector also a delivered stellar growth in the third quarter, up 18.24% y/y (Q2-2019: 8.02% y/y) while the information and communication sub-sector also expanded further by 9.88% y/y (Q2-2019: 9.01% y/y).</p>

      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the contraction in the trade sector deepened to -1.45% y/y while the real estate sector also contracted by 2.31% y/y in the third quarter. Noteworthy to mention, the financial sector bucked its four consecutive quarters of negative growth and recorded a growth of 1.07% y/y- we believe this was largely supported by the strong growth in the loan books of most deposit money banks (DMBs) in the period.</p>
      <p><b>In our opinion</b>, the recent policy by the Central Bank to improve lending and support growth in the real sector appears to be kicking in. The implementation of the loan-to deposit ratio (LDR) guideline early enough in the quarter, compelled banks to lend to the real sectors and had a multiplier effect on output from both the real sectors and the financial &amp; insurance sector and by extension aggregate economic output.</p>
      <p><b>In the near term</b>, we expect the Nigerian economy to remain in a cycle of secular stagnation, but we believe the Central Bank will continue to implement unconventional policies to improve economic growth in the long-term. Although rising inflation expectations remains a risk, we expect the CBN to remain on hold in the short-term: hiking rates, in recognition of increased upside risks to inflation and mounting external sector pressures would further constraint economic growth; while a rate cut is likely to intensify risks to NGN stability, resulting in increased capital outflows.</p>
