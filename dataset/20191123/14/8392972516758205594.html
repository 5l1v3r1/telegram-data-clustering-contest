      <h1>Question Time viewers complain of 'bias' after Corrie actress spotted in audience</h1>
      <h2>Actress spotted in the crowd</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:46:58+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:46</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Hirons</a></address>
      <p>The BBC's Question Time Leaders Debate happened last night and featured leaders of four of the main parties taking questions from a studio audience in Sheffield.</p>
      <p>But some viewers soon noticed a face they recognised in the crowd - and even accused the BBC of 'bias'.</p>
      <p>Hosted by Fiona Bruce, the show saw the Conservatives' Boris Johnson, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, the Liberal Democrats' Jo Swinson and the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon come in for some tough questions.</p>
      <p>And during Jo Swinson's interaction with the audience, viewers spotted <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> actress Kate Rutter, who was giving her a hard time.</p>

      <p>Kate also appeared in I, Daniel Blake, an award-winning 2016 film about Tory cuts and benefits directed by Ken Loach.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before eagle-eyed viewers spotted Kate and made the connection.</p>

      <p>One viewer said on Twitter: "So it seems Labour-supporting actress Kate Rutter (I, Daniel Blake) was invited on to the debate to grill Jo Swinson. Hmm".</p>
      <p>"Good to see the Bias Broadcasting Corporation caught out fielding 'ringer' on Question Time again," another wrote.</p>
      <p>And another made unsubstantiated accusations about Kate being both "far-left" and being in performance mode.</p>
      <p>"This time far-left activist and actress Kate Rutter (Coronation Street and I, Daniel Blake) is pretending to be an angry local," they spluttered.</p>
