    <meta property="og:description" content="Jurgen Klopp has named Andy Robertson in his starting lineup for Liverpoolâ€™s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace this afternoon. With the international break having come to a close, the Reds are back in action and on the hunt for another valuable three points.

      <p>With the international break having come to a close, the Reds are back in action and on the hunt for another valuable three points.</p>
      <p>Liverpool currently sit eight points clear at the summit and can look to extend their lead by clinching their 12th win in 13 games, with a member of the chasing pack set to drop points as <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> host <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a> in the late Saturday kickoff.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/naby-keita/">Naby Keita</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/james-milner/">James Milner</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/divock-origi/">Divock Origi</a> are among the other substitutes.</p>
