        <b>Leganes 1 Barcelona 2</b>
      </p>
      <p>Barcelona came from behind to snatch a 2-1 victory at La Liga’s basement club Leganes on Saturday after another unconvincing display away from home from the champions as substitute <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Arturo+Vidal">Arturo Vidal</a> struck a scrappy late winner.</p>
      <p>Struggling Leganes had taken the lead in coach Javier Aguirre’s first home game in charge thanks to a superb strike into the top corner from Morocco forward Youssef En-Nesyri in the 12th minute.</p>
      <p>The home side spurned two chances to extend their advantage before the break but Barca levelled in the 52nd minute when <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Luis+Suarez">Luis Suarez</a> glanced in Lionel Messi’s free kick.</p>
      <p>Barca won the game thanks to a fortunate goal in the 79th minute from Chilean midfielder Vidal, who was in a clear offside position when he knocked in from close range but a VAR review ruled him on as the ball had bounced off Leganes’ <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ruben+Perez">Ruben Perez</a>.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s side extended their lead at the top of the table by three points although second-placed Real Madrid can go level with them when they host Real Sociedad later on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Barca face title rivals Atletico Madrid away from home next and will have to do so without influential midfielder <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sergio+Busquets">Sergio Busquets</a> who is suspended after picking up a fifth yellow card of the campaign.</p>
