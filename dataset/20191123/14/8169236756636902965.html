        <b>Tottenham secured a 3-2 win over West Ham on Saturday as Jose Mourinho opened his account as Spurs boss with three points.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Goals from Heung-Min Son, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane sealed the victory for the visitors against the Hammers, as they also survived a late scare to deny their rivals a share of the spoils.</p>

      <p>In turn, Mourinho will be delighted as Tottenham picked up their first win away from home in the Premier League since January, and he’ll hope to now build on that moving forward.</p>
      <p>However, there was a moment late on where tempers and emotions almost boiled over as Harry Kane and Robert Snodgrass clashed with Mourinho watching on from the sideline.</p>
      <p>As seen in the video below, it was sparked by a late challenge from the Spurs striker, which Snodgrass clearly didn’t appreciate and let him know about it.</p>
      <p>In a rather bizarre move but also to perhaps stop himself from lashing out in a more aggressive manner, the West Ham ace appeared to merely pick Kane up before helping him on his way to the ground as referee Michael Oliver dished out a yellow card apiece.</p>
      <p>Fortunately it didn’t kick off from that incident as the players did come together, but order was restored and Mourinho will be keen to focus on the victory and a winning start to life at Tottenham this weekend rather than this incident.</p>
