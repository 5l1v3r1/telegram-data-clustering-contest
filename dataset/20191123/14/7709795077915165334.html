      </figure>
      <p>Leicester were on a roll before the international break and Brendan Rodgers will be hoping they can continue where they left off.</p>
      <p>Brighton have made improvements under Graham Potter and have won three of their last five, including against Spurs at the Amex, and will give it a good go on Saturday.</p>
      <p>This Foxes side, though, looks to have a great mindset under Rodgers and they should just edge the Seagulls, although the break could mean it's closer than they would like.</p>
      <p>A nice price we are opting for is in the scoring markets - on a midfielder who contributes a lot in the final third and is available at 11/2 anytime.</p>
      <p>Belgium international Youri Tielemans has five goals and five assists for the Foxes this term in all competitions, averaging just over two shots per game in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He had four efforts in the win over Arsenal last time out and has registered a total of six in the previous three games before that.</p>
      <p>He has not scored in a couple of games and is due. With the positions he gets in, late runs into the box and a tendency to shoot on sight, this price makes the 22-year-old well worth a small play.</p>

        <b>Key stats</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leicester have won six of their last seven Premier League games (L1), winning the last four by an aggregate score of 15-1 and keeping a clean sheet in their last three. The Foxes have won five Premier League games in a row twice before, in April 2016 and April 2017.</li>
        <li>Leicester have conceded the fewest goals in the Premier League this season (8), while only Manchester City (35) have netted more than the Foxes (29).</li>
        <li>This is the first time Leicester are playing a Premier League game when starting the day in the top two of the table since the final game of their 2015-16 title winning season (1-1 vs Chelsea). Brighton have lost seven of their eight Premier League games against sides in the top two, including the last six in a row since a 1-0 win over Man Utd in May 2018.</li>
        <li>Since the start of last season, Leicester’s James Maddison has scored more Premier League goals from outside the box than any other player in the competition (7), including three of his four strikes this term.</li>
