      <p>Newcastle United Under-23s were held to a 1-1 draw against Benfica B.</p>
      <p>In a game against the next generation side of the 37-times Portuguese champions, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> has their moments in attack but were left hanging on and indebted to goalkeeper Jake Turner for some superb late saves.</p>
      <p>Here’s how the Toon youngsters rated at Whitley Park.</p>
      <p>Jake Turner 9 <br/>Only beaten by a penalty kick and made some outstanding stops to help seal the point. His tip over to deny Nuno Santos was a crucial moment. Tipped David Zec effort away seconds later. <br/><br/>Jamie Sterry 7 <br/>Could easily have taken the easy option and sulked after being left out of the senior squad. Instead is using his experience to guide younger players. He did it well against Benfica. <br/><br/>Lewis Cass 7 <br/>A steady outing against some crafty Benfica front men. <br/><br/>Ludwig Francillette 8 <br/>Really starting to settle down and capped fine defensive display with superb headed goal.</p>

      <p>Oliver Walters 7 <br/>Worked hard and stayed focus to help see out the point. <br/><br/>Thomas Allan 7 <br/>Always looked a threat. Put in a fine cross for Young who almost grabbed a goal. <br/><br/>Jack Young 7 <br/>Continues his push for a spot in training with the first team. Has all the attributes of a traditional central midfielder.</p>
      <p>Mo Sangare 6 <br/>Can be sloppy in possession at times but a genuine presence in the engine room. <br/><br/>Rosaire Longelo 7 <br/>An industrious 65 minute run out and weighed in with an assist. <br/><br/>Elliot Anderson 7 <br/>Looked lively and was denied by an excellent save from the keeper just before half-time.</p>

      <p>Luke Charman 6 <br/>Nothing came off for him. But then didn’t get great service with series of long balls punted in for spells. <br/><br/>Subs <br/><br/>Adam Wilson 6 (for Longelo 65) <br/>Back from injury and feeling his way back into things. <br/><br/>Victor Fernandez 6 (for Anderson 72) <br/>Didn’t have too much time to make an impact. <br/><br/>Joe White (for Allan 79) <br/>Cameo run out ahead of junior game against Spurs on Saturday, a game in which he scored in a 5-2 win. <br/><br/>*Subs must play 15 mins to gain a mark.</p>
