      <p>A coroner has issued a warning about taking cocaine after a pregnant mum of six died in her home after taking the drug.</p>
      <p>Lindsey Ann Hughes was taken ill in her kitchen on March 14 and died 13 days later in hospital in North Wales on March 27.</p>
      <p>Lindsey, 34, was 15 weeks pregnant with a son who was perfectly healthy when she died.</p>
      <p>Miss Hughes, from Llangefni,Â  eventually died from broncho-pneumonia, which caused her to collapse and led to respiratory failure - <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/death-pregnant-mum-six-prompts-17295963?_ga=2.181396706.494070689.1574271104-1477218377.1509704886">reports North Wales Live.</a></p>

      <p>At her inquest held in Caernarfon, Coroner Dewi Pritchard said an "abnormally high level eight times over the level for driving" of cocaine was found in her system, which would have contributed to her death.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem examination revealed she had damage to her heart known as cardiac fibrosis, which can be caused by chronic cocaine use.</p>
      <p>Benzodiazepine, a drug used for a variety of medical conditions, such as anxiety, seizures, and for alcohol withdrawal, was also found in her system.</p>
      <p>The baby Miss Hughes was carrying at the time of her death was said to be a "perfectly healthy male foetus".</p>
      <p>Mr Pritchard said: "I am seeing far too many cocaine deaths as the use of cocaine in this part of the world is very common.</p>

      <p>" <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/cocaine-fuelled-baby-biter-crossbow-17271228">Cocaine</a> damages the heart by killing off patches of heart tissue and causes a tightening of the vessels.</p>
      <p>"Even low levels of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/crime-kingpin-snapchat-mum-bars-17278711">cocaine</a> can cause catastrophic results and repeat use causes more and more damage.</p>
      <p>"The public think cocaine doesn't do any long-term harm but it does.</p>
      <p>" <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/cocaine-dealer-stabbed-drug-gang-17258425">Cocaine</a> use can and does cause long term issues."</p>
      <p>He said Miss Hughes died as a result of respiratory failure due to the broncho-pneumonia but cocaine toxicity was a contributing factor.</p>
      <p>He said: "If she had not taken cocaine in the past the probability is that she would have survived the broncho-pneumonia, but we cannot be sure.</p>
      <p>"Because of the broncho-pneumonia she died of natural causes, this is not a drug death, the cocaine contributed but did not ultimately cause her death."</p>
      <p>It was also noted that Miss Hughes' immune system would have been suppressed due to the fact she was pregnant.</p>
      <p>At the time of her death, her friend Helen Evans described her as "full of life" and a "brilliant mother".</p>
      <p>She said: "She was a devoted mother and partner, caring daughter and joyful sister - her death has left a massive hole in so many people's lives."</p>
