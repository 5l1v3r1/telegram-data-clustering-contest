      <p><b>NAIROBI: </b>At least 29 people were killed in Kenya when their homes were swept away in landslides during ferocious overnight rainstorms, the government said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Their homes were hit in the early hours of Saturday amid torrential rains in the Pokot region, 350 kilometres northwest of the capital Nairobi.</p>
      <p>“We are saddened to confirm that 12 people from Tapach and Parua in Pokot South, and 17 from Tamkal in Pokot Central lost their lives,” Interior Minister Fred Matiang’i said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Our profound sympathies go to the families and friends of those who have been affected.”</p>

      <p>Army and police helicopters have been sent, Matiang’i said, with rescue efforts delayed because roads have been cut and bridges closed after streams turned into raging torrents.</p>
      <p>“Massive landslides reported in various areas of West Pokot County following heavy downpour,” Kenya Red Cross said in a message, adding its emergency response teams had deployed to help.</p>

      <p>West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said that two children were pulled out alive from the smashed wreckage of their mud-covered homes.</p>
      <p>“They have been rushed to hospital,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rescue efforts to dig bodies out of the dirt continued.</p>
      <p>“The challenge we are facing is the heavy rains, but we are trying our best,” he added.</p>
      <p>It is not only Kenya that is affected. The landslides come amid weeks of destructive rains and flooding across East Africa.</p>
      <p>Violent downpours have displaced tens of thousands in Somalia, submerged whole towns in South Sudan and killed dozens in flash floods and landslides in Ethiopia and Tanzania too.</p>
      <p>Close to a million people in South Sudan alone are affected with growing fears of disease and starvation.</p>
      <p>Floods hit East Africa regularly, but scientists say that it has been exacerbated by a powerful climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean stronger than any seen in years.</p>
      <p>The extreme weather is blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole — a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.</p>
      <p>The ocean off East Africa is currently far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation resulting in rain over the continent.</p>
