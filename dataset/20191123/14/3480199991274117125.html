      <p>A model railway exhibit which was destroyed by vandals has gone on display after being restored thanks to an outpouring of donations.</p>
      <p>Members of the Market Deeping Model Railway Club said a “life’s work” had been destroyed after youths trashed the £30,000 display at Stamford, Lincolnshire, on May 18.</p>
      <p>A surge in crowdfunded donations, including £10,000 from singer and model railway enthusiast Sir Rod Stewart, allowed the club to raise more than £107,000 to go towards repairs.</p>

      <p>The sets are now restored and on display at the Warley National Model Railway Show at the Birmingham NEC.</p>
      <p>Market Deeping Model Railway Club chairman Peter Davies told the PA news agency that he was “delighted” at the restoration of the display.</p>
      <p>He said: “We had to rebuild from the platform up.</p>
      <p>“As chairman of the club I am proud of all of the guys.”</p>
      <p>Mr Davies said that it took 25 club members 1,000 hours of work to restore the models by hand, with some of the originals having taken years to build.</p>
      <p>Commenting on Sir Rod’s “amazing and truly humbling” donation, he added: “This kind of thing doesn’t happen, model railway exhibitions don’t get trashed.</p>
      <p>“To have that sort of donation has enabled us to get back on track.”</p>

      <p>He told PA he was going to meet the singer and now honorary club member when they both appear as guests on the BBC’s The One Show on Monday.</p>
      <p>In August, Lincoln Youth Court heard that three “mindless” youths shared a bottle of vodka as part of a pre-exam night out before deliberately destroying the exhibition, which was on display at the Stamford Welland Academy.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old schoolboys, along with a fourth defendant, went on a 4am “rampage” by pushing tables over and throwing parts of displays against the wall.</p>
      <p>The Warley National Exhibition is on Saturday and Sunday and showcases more than 90 model railway layouts from the UK and abroad.</p>
