      <p>The District Review Committee (DRC) on Saturday passed a resolution banning TDP MLC N. Lokesh from attending its meetings in future.</p>
      <p>Mangalagiri MLA Alla Ramakrishna Reddy moved the resolution, which was supported by other members.</p>
      <p>MLC K.S. Lakshmana Rao, however, did not support the resolution.</p>
      <p>Housing Minister Ch. Sri Ranganadha Raju, who is district in-charge Minister, Home Minister M. Sucharita and Marketing Minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana Rao were present.</p>
      <p>Moving the resolution, Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy accused Mr. Lokesh of using derogatory language against the Chief Minister during his visits to the district.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Lokesh has been uttering words such as ‘psycho’ while criticising the Chief Minister. Why should we allow such a person to sit in the DRC meeting?” he questioned.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lakshmana Rao said it was unfair to pass the resolution and advised the members to take to constitutional methods to take action.</p>
