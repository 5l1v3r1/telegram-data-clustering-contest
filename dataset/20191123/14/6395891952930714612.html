      <p><b>DAYTON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Authorities say a man's body has been found in a vacant home during a search for a missing Ohio couple.</p>
      <p>The Montgomery County Coroner's Office in Dayton says the body of 28-year-old Todd Burkhart, of Mansfield, was found Friday night inside a vacant home in Dayton. No cause of death has been released.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Burkhart and 20-year-old Kyla Hayton were reported missing Monday in Mansfield, 135 miles (217 kilometers) north of Dayton. Hayton is pregnant.</p>
      <p>The couple's car was found Wednesday in Dayton.</p>
      <p>Burkhart's sister told The Ashland Times-Gazette that Burkhart planned to go to Columbus last weekend to drop off a package and then buy an AR-15 military-style assault rifle.</p>
      <p>The couple dropped off their 4-year-old daughter at the Columbus home of Hayton's mother last Saturday.</p>
