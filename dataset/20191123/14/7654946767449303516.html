      <h1>The Queen needs to fire even more royals — or the monarchy will die</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T14:49:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Ridley</a></address>
      <p>What do you call one less self-absorbed minor royal as part of the British monarchy? A good start.</p>
      <p>After his <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">calamitous TV interview</a> addressing his role in the Jeffrey Epstein pedophile scandal, Prince Andrew was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/prince-andrew-didnt-step-back-from-royal-duties-queen-elizabeth-fired-him/">“fired” from public duties and kicked out of his Buckingham Palace</a> office by his long-suffering mother, Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
      <p>As her curmudgeonly husband, the 98-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, might retort: “It’s time to sack the whole bloody lot!”</p>
      <p>I’m a British American and a royalist to boot, so I wouldn’t go as far as that. But it’s high time for a radical pruning of the royal family, which cost UK taxpayers a whopping $86 million in 2018 and 2019.</p>
      <p>Heir to the throne, Prince Charles, is on the right track with his mission — discussed by top courtiers behind closed Buckingham Palace doors — to reduce the number of hangers-on. Because if a pare-down doesn’t happen before the beloved 93-year-old queen finally passes, Prince Andrew and his ilk could kill off the monarchy for good.</p>
      <p>Make no mistake, the House of Windsor is facing serious peril in its most damaging episode since the queen’s annus horribilis in 1992. That was the year Prince Charles got caught telling his lover Camilla Parker Bowles that he wished he was her “tampon,” Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson split, and a devastating fire tore through Windsor Castle.</p>
      <p>Folks like Andrew, 59, who until Wednesday drew an annual Sovereign Grant allowance of $323,000, must get a proper job.</p>
      <p>His previous vanity position as a trade envoy for Britain was a joke. In 2010, WikiLeaks revealed a secret cable from US Ambassador Tatiana Gfoeller accusing the then 50-year-old prince of speaking “cockily” and verging “on rude” during an official engagement.</p>

      <p>His staff nicknamed him His Buffoon Highness because of his stupidity and sense of superiority. Those in the know were not surprised by his ill-fated sit-down on Nov. 16, when he expressed zero compassion for Epstein’s victims.</p>
      <p>The stilted Q&amp;A in which he denied any recollection of accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre was tone-deaf. He bored on about doing the “honorable” thing by breaking up with Epstein in person in Manhattan after he was convicted for procuring an underage girl as a prostitute. As one of my journalist friends commented on Facebook: “Prince Andrew thinks we are as thick as he is.”</p>
      <p>Suddenly, with this one interview, the world was given a window into the mind of a spoiled, bloated aristocrat, leading many to question his relevance.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t the first time he had embarrassed himself on TV. In October 2018, he appeared on a morning show and gushed about the upcoming society <a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/10/13/princess-eugenies-wedding-reception-was-quite-the-party/">wedding of his youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie</a>, at Windsor Castle, claiming she had attracted more guests than Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had to their nuptials earlier that year.</p>
      <p>Even if that was true, the BBC — obviously not impressed — declined to broadcast Eugenie’s union, and it was left to the morning show of an independent network to air it, while security for the event cost the British public $2.6 million, causing a huge stink.</p>
      <p>Andrew sums up what royalty is about these days: Rather than duty, exemplified by the queen, he and the other riffraff are nothing but frivolous, pointless, arrogant wasters. The excessive vacations, private jet-taking and schmoozing with the likes of Elton John are stealing attention from the family’s crucial work promoting Britain and their charitable causes.</p>
      <p>Some members of the family have already been taken down a peg. In 2010, the fabulously snobby Princess Michael of Kent (aka Princess Pushy) began paying $150,000-a-year rent for her five-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace. She previously lived there under a “grace and favor” arrangement that was a 1978 wedding present from the queen.</p>
      <p>The monarch’s only daughter, hardworking Princess Anne, wisely refused royal titles for her kids, Zara and Peter Phillips. She followed in the footsteps of Princess Margaret, whose children, Viscount Linley and Lady Sara Chatto, were never given HRH status.</p>

      <p>It’s time to go further. Both Eugenie, 29 and her sister, Beatrice, 31, should be stripped of their privileges. The bon vivants seem nice enough, but do they really need to be bowed and scraped to as ninth and 10th in the line to the throne?</p>
      <p>Trimming the fat is the only way forward for the monarchy if it wants to survive — and the queen obviously agrees.</p>

      <p>At her 2012 Diamond Jubilee celebrations, a vastly slimmed-down cast appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace: Elizabeth II, Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, Prince William, Kate Middleton and Prince Harry (Prince Philip was absent because of illness).</p>
      <p>Those seven people (along with William’s three children) are the only ones who matter to the throne. And they’re the only ones who should represent the country. After all, there’s only so many garden fetes you can open.</p>
      <p>And now that Markle has burst onto the scene, creating royal havoc wherever she goes, I’d argue the scalpel should be taken to Prince Harry and his new wife, too. Speaking on a TV documentary, Markle famously bemoaned royal life as “a lot.” She and Harry are currently taking legal action against British newspapers for copyright infringement and phone hacking. If they’re really so unhappy, they should be exiled to LA.</p>
      <p>If the royals who can’t get with the program don’t fall on their swords, the British public might call for a revolution and the UK republicans will get exactly what they want: a Britain without a sovereign. It would be curtains for Prince Charles and his heirs. And Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle would be reduced to mere tourist traps selling tea towels of cartoon corgis.</p>
