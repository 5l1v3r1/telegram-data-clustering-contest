      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liam-payne/">Liam Payne</a> looked happier than ever as he cosied up to girlfriend Maya Henry after shutting down rumours over her age.</p>
      <p>And the Strip That Down singer couldn’t wipe the smile from his face while cuddling the 19-year-old model, during an appearance at the Business of Fashion Presents VOICES 2019 Gala Dinner, in Oxfordshire.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old rocked a pinstripe suit, complete with a white shirt and black tie, at the swanky bash – in honour of Vogue editor Edward Enninful.</p>
      <p>While the model looked every inch the proud girlfriend, in a stunning a lime green, strapless floor-length gown.</p>
      <p>Their appearance comes after the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/liam-payne-shuts-rumours-girlfriend-maya-henry-lied-age-joking-cheryl-reunion-11064606/">One Direction star was forced to hit out at speculation Maya had lied about her age</a>, with many claiming she was actually a year younger.</p>
      <p>Super sleuths on the internet have other ideas dug up old Instagram pictures and an article written about her lavish quinceanera (15th birthday) celebrations back in 2016 – with a fan suggesting she is actually 18-years-old.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Every article about Liam’s girlfriend says she’s 19 when she’s actually 18,’ the viral Twitter thread read.</p>

      <p>‘This is intentional because when fabricating this ridiculous PR campaign for her they said that they’ve been together for a year, which would mean that Liam was dating a 17 y/o. She’s a senior in [High School].’</p>
      <p>Hitting back, the dad-of-one swiftly poured ice-cold water on the claims, replying: ‘19 don’t believe everything you read on the internet.’</p>
      <p>Noted.</p>
      <p>Liam recently lifted the lid on their relationship – and melted our hearts at the same time – when he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/24/liam-payne-praises-awesome-new-girlfriend-maya-henry-reveals-biggest-difference-ex-cheryl-10802244/">praised his girlfriend for always keeping a huge smile on his face</a>.</p>
      <p>Alongside an Instagram snap of the pair cuddling on the sofa, he said: ‘Sometimes I don’t recognise this happy guy… sure glad you brought him back though.’</p>
      <p>After thanking his team for their help, he added: ‘Then last but not least this one @maya_henry for always keeping the biggest smile on my face through all the stress and making me realise how perfect my life really is.</p>
      <p>‘Love you all let’s stack this s**t up.’</p>
