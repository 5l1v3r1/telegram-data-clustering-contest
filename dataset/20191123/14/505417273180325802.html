        <b>Jose Mourinho has begun life as Tottenham manager with a win as he saw his new side put in a brilliant first half performance to defeat West Ham by 3-2 at The London Stadium.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier in the week <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/robredmond/jose-mourinho-tottenham-troy-parrott/">Mourinho</a> told midfielder Dele Alli, who has been having a decidedly quiet season for Spurs, that he wanted to see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/22/jose-mourinho-dele-alli-deles-brother-spurs-vintage-form"> the real Dele Alli,</a> and 10 minutes before halftime he finally showed up.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old picked the ball up just outside the 18-yard box and threaded a lovely ball through to Son Heung-min who lashed it past Roberto in the West Ham goal – although the Spaniard arguably could’ve done better.</p>

      <p>Soon after it was 2-0 and again Alli had a part to play, as he brilliantly improvised a flick to Son as the ball looked destined to go out of play, which eventual led to Lucas Moura flying in to finish at the back post.</p>

      <p>Spurs looked comfortable, and early in the second half they had their third, it was Serge Aurier who was the provider this time as Harry Kane grabbed his first goal of the Mourinho era.</p>
      <p>The second half wasn’t all plain sailing for Tottenham though, as West Ham managed to grab a goal back through substitute Michail Antonio, whose fizzing strike beat Paulo Gazzaniga in the Spurs goal.</p>
      <p>The Hammers thought they had scored a late second in stoppage time only for VAR to rule the goal out thanks to Declan Rice’s offside in the build-up.</p>

      <p>They did however reduce the deficit to one goal when defender Angelo Ogbonna found the net from Robert Snodgrass’ corner but it was too little too late.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsNews/status/1198246959582048256?s=20">For Spurs and Mourinho it’s a first away win in the Premier League since January</a> in his first game in charge and in Dele Alli he looks to have a player who is finally getting back to his best.</p>
