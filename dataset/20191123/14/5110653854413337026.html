      <p>The Patriots head into the weekend with a possible concern about quarterback Tom Brady.</p>
      <p>New England <a href="https://www.patriots.com/news/week-12-patriots-cowboys-injury-report?frifinal">listed Brady (elbow) as questionable</a> for its late-afternoon game Sunday vs. the Cowboys, but NFL Network's Ian Rapoport <a href="https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/1197995791274651648">reported that Brady is expected to play</a>. Brady was a limited participant in Friday's practice, the team said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Brady, 42, has displayed legendary durability throughout his career. He has started all 10 of New England's games this season, and aside from 2016, when he was suspended by the NFL for the first four games for his role in Deflategate, and 2008, when he suffered season-ending knee injury in Week 1, he has started all 16 games every year from 2002-18.He started 14 of 14 games after taking over for an injured Drew Bledsoe as the No. 1 QB in Week 3 of the 2001 season.</p>
      <p>If Brady cannot go Sunday, then rookie Jarrett Stidham would take over. Stidham, 23, has thrown four passes, completing two, this year. He also has thrown an interception, which the Jets' Jamal Adams returned for a touchdown.</p>
      <p>Brady has led the Patriots to a 9-1 record, but several of his key numbers are down compared to recent years. His completion percentage (63.7), yards per attempt (7.0) and passer rating (90.7) are all at their lowest since the 2013 season.</p>
      <p>New England leads the AFC East by two games over the Bills and also have a head-to-head tiebreaker over Buffalo.</p>
