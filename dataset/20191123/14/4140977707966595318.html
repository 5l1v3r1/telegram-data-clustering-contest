          <p>There are some leagues across the footballing fraternity which have become bastions of a singular side with these sides making them their personal playgrounds. For Ajax, Eredivisie has become a league to toy around with, with the side sitting atop of the points tally to emerge as the standalone league leaders after 13 gameweeks.</p>
          <p>The only side in the league to have a speckle free record in their artillery, the side have ended up tallying the 35 points with 11 wins and the two draws to stamp their credentials all across the league and set a statement of intent. Undoubtedly the overwhelming favourites as things stand, the side are being touted as clear winners of the glistening trophy despite us not even touching the headway mark, a narrative which is a testament to the kind of vibrant, quirky and enigmatic football they have doled out till now.</p>

                <p>The side are coming into today’s impending clash having routed Utrecht 4-0 in their previous affair, a match which alluded towards just how enterprising and piquant the side’s attacking gameplan is. It’s a performance they’ll be looking to emulate when they go at battle against Heracles today, a side who’ll be finding it extremely difficult to refrain such a staunch outfit.</p>
                <p>Currently in seventh place in the league Heracles come into today’s tie with the side themselves having thrived on the attacking front the last time around as they thumped Venlo 6-1 to get their sixth win of the season. It’s a display they’ll be backing on and looking to reverberate as they try and make things jittery for an opposition who can only be defeated if they are outscored.</p>

                            <p>Irrespective of if he is able to come out with a shut down today, the onslaught of shots he’s going to be up against will see Blashwin amass a solid amount of save points to see us make him our choice for this one.
