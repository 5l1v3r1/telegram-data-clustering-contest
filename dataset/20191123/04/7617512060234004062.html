      <p>B.C. Hydro says its customers are largely unprepared for power outages despite increasingly severe winter storms.</p>
      <p>The Crown utility says in a report that it’s seeing increasing damage to its infrastructure because of storms in recent years.</p>
      <p>A powerful windstorm last December left 750,000 customers without power and tens of thousands waited days and weeks for power to be restored in the largest outage in the utility’s history.</p>
      <p>B.C. Hydro says a survey of 800 customers found more than 60  per cent have not taken steps to prepare for storm-related power outages and only half have an emergency kit.</p>
      <p>The survey found that most people affected by the December 2018 storm felt they could have been more prepared, yet only half have taken any steps toward that since then.</p>
      <p>B.C. Hydro is encouraging customers to stock emergency kits with enough supplies to sustain each member of a household for at least three days. A kit should include a flashlight with extra batteries, a first-aid kit, any required medication, non-perishable food and bottled water.</p>
      <p>The utility is reminding people to call 911 if they come across a downed or damaged power line, which should be considered live and dangerous.</p>
      <p>B.C. Hydro is also preparing itself for winter storms, with new technology and processes to confirm outages, improve communication in the field and predict storms. The utility says it spends about $50 million a year on its vegetation-management program to help prevent tree-related outages. In 2018, crews removed more than 52,000 trees.</p>
      <p>It also performs regular maintenance and upgrades to the system to help ensure reliability and prevent outages, replacing about 10,000 damaged or weakened power poles each year.</p>
      <p>Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands were hardest hit by last December’s storm, with about 87% of B.C. Hydro customers in the region losing power.</p>
      <p>The storm saw winds coming from multiple directions — generally in the range of 70 to 100 kilometres an hour, with gusts topping 100 km/h in some areas.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of trees fell, making roads impassable in some places. As a result of the storm, there were twice as many tree-related outages on the Island in 2018 compared with the five-year average.</p>
      <p>In December 2017, an ice storm that hit the Fraser Valley caused challenges for crews when freezing rain and below-zero temperatures caused ice to form on trees, which broke and fell onto power lines or knocked down power poles.</p>
      <p>B.C. Hydro said its equipment became encased in ice and the poor weather conditions made it extremely difficult for crews to respond.</p>
      <p>In August 2015, a summer windstorm knocked out power to more than 700,000 customers over a three-day period on the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.</p>
