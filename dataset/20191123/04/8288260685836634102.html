      <h2>Birmingham City latest | All the latest Blues news and views from BirminghamLive as the U23s come from behind and Garry Monk talks Financial Fair Play</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Garry Monk says Sheffield Wednesday’s recent EFL charge for financial misconduct is a ‘different situation’ to the one which <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> found itself in.</p>
      <p>Like Blues, Wednesday have endured difficulties with Financial Fair Play over the last 12 months and the EFL have taken action after the Owls sold Hillsborough to owner Dejphon Chansiri for £60million to avoid breaching rules in 2017/18.</p>
      <p>Blues’ 2017 spend under Gianfranco Zola and Harry Redknapp left the club with a FFP deficit they were unable to haul back and the EFL slapped them with a nine-point deduction towards the end of last season.</p>

      <p>Monk was manager of Blues throughout the 2018/19 season before being sacked over the summer.</p>
      <p>And Monk believes Wednesday’s situation differs to his former club because of the constant dialogue between the Owls and the EFL during the last year.</p>
      <p>“It was a different situation with the charges at Birmingham and what they are here at Sheffield Wednesday,” Monk explained. “At that time, I was unaware that we were going to be coming into an embargo, FFP and it obviously turned out to be like that (points deduction).</p>

      <p>“There were different circumstances behind the scenes in terms of communication. You can see that the club here has communicated (with the EFL) over the past year, for sure.</p>
      <p>“And for them to come out and charge us for something which had been agreed and ratified by the EFL is a different experience to what I had at Birmingham.”</p>
      <p>Wednesday claim the EFL have moved the goalposts with regards to their own FFP situation.</p>
      <p>Monk added: “Having spoken to everyone at the club, it was the surprise of it. I think the communication between the club and the EFL over the last year has been fantastic.</p>
      <p>“It was the surprise of that coming, no one saw that. The biggest part of that surprise is the charges being put forward are things the EFL would have ratified and agreed to at the very beginning.”</p>
      <h3>Comeback kids</h3>
      <p>Kane Thompson-Sommers’ late strike gave Birmingham City’s Under 23s their fifth PDL 2 win in succession.</p>
      <p>But Steve Spooner’s side had to come from behind against Hull City to stay top of their league at a sodden Wast Hills.</p>
      <p>Blues edged a scoreless first half, dominating possession and territory and sending in a handful of shots on the Hull goal.</p>
      <p>With Ryan Stirk pulling the strings in midfield and Ryan Burke providing width on the left the hosts pressed forward.</p>
      <p>The pair combined for the best chance of the opening period when, in the 39th minute, the left back lifted an inviting pass over the defence for Stirk to latch on to.</p>

      <p>The Welsh Under 21 took a touch and hammered a shot which Will Mannion pushed away.</p>
      <p>Burke also had a looping cross which dropped just wide of the far post and Mannion needed to claw away Odin Bailey’s deep centre.</p>
      <p>Despite that it was Hull who took the lead three minutes after the restart when Matty Jacob curled in from the left and found Danny Lupano, the defender powered his header into the corner of the net.</p>

      <h3>Ratings</h3>
      <p>Here’s how the Blues boys rated</p>
      <h4>Moha Ramos 6.5</h4>
      <p>Unbelievably calm, almost too calm, with a couple of awkward bouncing balls that threatened to fly over his head. Saved a low daisy-cutter in the 33rd minute, no chance a powerfully headed goal - then largely unused for the final half hour.</p>
      <h4>Nico Gordon 6</h4>
      <p>One really strong run which took him to the bye-line in the first half, harshly booked just before the break and taken off with dizziness at half time.</p>
      <h4>Joe Redmond 8</h4>
      <p>Looked unruffled in a first half where he had very little defending to do. Struck a free kick which looked to be on target before being deflected wide. A half-time reshuffle saw him move to right back where he gave a passable Maxime Colin impression - even pulling off an outrageous nutmeg.</p>
      <h4>Geraldo Bajrami 8</h4>

      <p>It all looked a bit too easy for the Albania U21. One important one-on-one tackle blunted a Hull counter in the first half. Read the game well, distribution good throughout. Time for senior football.</p>

      <h3>Every word</h3>
      <p>The international break is over and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/pep-clotet">Pep Clotet </a>met the media ahead of this weekend's trip to Huddersfield Town.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a>'s caretaker head coach talked about his team's improved fitness, the return of Gary Gardner and - of course, Lee Camp's form.</p>
      <p>Here's what was discussed.</p>
      <h4>How is everyone feeling and how has international training been during the break?</h4>
      <p>I think everybody feels very confident. They feel strong in their own football and their own abilities. We all know that we’ve put games to bed. </p>
      <p>But we are confident because we have been creating chances and we have had an average of 18 shots a game for the last six games. We know the right route in football is to create as many chances as possible and naturally the goals will follow.</p>
      <p>The spirit is very good, and we are trying to play the best football we can to our abilities and our possibilities.</p>
      <p>We did a lot of work physically and some tests and we realised that we are much fitter than we thought we were going to be and because we have compared with seasons before we are in good position physically and is a good boost compared to where the team were.</p>
