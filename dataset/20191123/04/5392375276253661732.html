      <p>The Honor V30 we first <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/22/honor-v30-unveiled-in-first-official-video/">saw yesterday</a> in the official teaser has now been spotted on the streets with its price tag exposed. As we can see in the image below, the Honor V30 will cost 4999 Yuan in its 5G version, that’s around $710 or 640€; definitely an hefty price for the device which however is in line with other 5G phones on the market.</p>

      <p>As a matter of fact, the Honor V30 would have the same exact price of the Huawei Mate 30 5G. The handset currently sells in China for 4999 Yuan and it packs some of the best hardware in Huawei’s warehouse; such as the powerful Kirin 990 SoC.</p>
      <p>It’s indeed quite certain Honor’s flagship will be equipping the same chipset along with its support for 5G connectivity. The Huawei Kirin 990 is one the best chips as far as 5G tech is concerned, both on the signal coverage and energy consumption side; this is also what got the CPU the “<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/16/huawei-kirin-990-5g-chip-china-mobile/">Best 5G Chip</a>” award at the latest China Mobile Partner Conference.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the modern chipset also supports SA / NSA dual-mode 5G which brings a faster and more reliable cellular connection.</p>

      <p>The Honor V30 is then going to boast a very interesting “Matrix” camera feature; of which we had a preview <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/?p=267697&amp;preview=true">over here</a>. The Matrix algorithm will be able to create a 3D map of what’s being shot and separate the subject from the background; thus you will be able to swap the latter if you so desired. There are most likely going to be more practical use scenarios in the future, but we aren’t aware of any at the moment.</p>
      <p>The Matrix feature is going to work both with the cameras on the back where we find at least three, and on the front were we have two sensors in a pill-shaped punch-hole design.</p>

      <p>Other specs on the Honor V30 should include at least 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. We’ll then find a 4000mAh battery, 22.5W fast charging and MagicUI 3 based on Android 10.</p>
