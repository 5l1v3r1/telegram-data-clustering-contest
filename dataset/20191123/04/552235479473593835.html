      <p>A baby was blinded in one eye after a woman attacked him, a court heard yesterday.</p>
      <p>Caroline Thomson, 30, of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk">Falkirk</a>, admitted assaulting the tiny tot to his permanent impairment, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of his life.</p>
      <p>The offence was committed on various occasions between May 2 and June 16 last year, when the boy was aged between three weeks and nine weeks, at addresses in Larbert, Stirlingshire, and Falkirk.</p>
      <p>The baby suffered multiple rib fractures, bleeding on the brain, a broken right wrist, fractures to the base of both big toes and a detached retina, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">High Court</a> in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> heard.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Kath Harper said: “The accused told the police the injuries may have been caused when she dropped the baby and said some of the injuries could have been caused by a two-year-old child.”</p>
      <p>The court heard consultant ophthalmologist Jennifer Ann Gillen examined the boy’s eyes.</p>
      <p>She said she had never seen a detached retina in a young baby and such an injury would require some form of blunt force trauma.</p>
      <p>The boy, who is now 19 months old, can’t speak and is unable to walk, although he can crawl.</p>
      <p>Judge Lady Rae remanded Thomson in custody and deferred sentence until next month.</p>
      <p>Defence QC Bert Kerrigan will give his plea in mitigation then.</p>
