      <p>A 34-year-old suspect has been arrested at the Beitbridge Border Post in Limpopo after he attempted to smuggle explosives into the country.</p>
      <p>Police say the explosives were carried in four-gallon containers that were loaded on a trailer on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The suspect initially told border officials on duty that it contained oil.</p>
      <p>He was then directed towards a baggage scanner, and when the containers were subsequently opened, 398 pieces of blasting cartridges were found and the suspect was immediately arrested.</p>
      <p>The person, who is from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, will appear in the Musina Magistrate's Court soon on charges of possession of explosive materials.</p>
      <p>Police say the motive for smuggling explosives into South Africa is not known at this stage, and police investigations are continuing.</p>
