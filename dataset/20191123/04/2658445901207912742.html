      <p>Which of the two dominant political parties, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Congress (APC), can claim to occupy the moral high ground as regards its conduct in the just concluded November 16, governorship elections? Unfortunately, there is none in my view. In Bayelsa State, Governor Seriake Dickson has vehemently condemned the conduct of the exercise alleging that soldiers of the Nigerian Army as well as compromised electoral officials colluded with the APC to rig the polls in favour of David Lyon through intimidation, violence and fraudulent thumb printing of ballot papers. He has thus called for the outright cancellation of the votes in large swathes of the state and the PDP candidate, Senator Douye Diri, is most certainly proceeding to the Election Petition Tribunal to seek redress as is always the case in Nigeria after elections.</p>
      <p>But then, Dickson has minuscule moral right to complain as he also used the whole weight of state power, particularly the state’s financial muscle as incumbent governor, to rail road his candidate through the PDP governorship primaries. And even in picking the Deputy Governorship candidate, the governor refused to take into account the interests of other critical stakeholders in the state, including former President Goodluck Jonathan. Dickson is thus not protesting because he believes in the integrity and credibility of elections as a deeply held personal value. Rather, his lamentation stems from the fact that this time around, his party was contesting from a position of weakness with the APC in control of the centre and thus being able to exert greater influence over the security and electoral agencies in addition to enjoying better fiscal fecundity.</p>
      <p>What happened in Bayelsa was a case of a substantial number of disaffected PDP leaders and members voting against their party with the APC as the beneficiary. There is absolutely nothing that the APC did in Bayelsa last Saturday that the PDP had not done throughout the Niger Delta during elections since 1999. The reaction of prominent PDP members and indeed the general public in Bayelsa to the outcome of the election indicates that the polls, despite its flaws, reflected the will of a majority of the electorate. It is difficult to sympathize with Dickson.  As my colleague, Festus Eriye, noted in his column on Wednesday, our all powerful state governors are not invincible deities after all whose command must be obeyed in elections. The incremental demystification of incumbent Chief Executives in future elections at both the federal and state levels is a necessary condition for the accelerated positive development of our electoral process.</p>
      <p>I am unaware of any analyst who claimed before Kogi’s governorship election that Yahaya Bello deserved to be re-elected for a second term based on his performance. His deliverability as regards the dividends of democracy was near zero.  But hardly are elections won anywhere in Nigeria simply on the basis of performance. Factors like ethnicity and other sectional considerations, religion, financial power, superior capacity for violence, party loyalty, and degree of control over the electoral umpire among others weigh much higher than performance in determining voter behavior generally in Nigeria. Kogi was thus not an exception in this regard. It is just that Bello outclassed the mediocrity of his predecessors particularly because of his inability to pay workers salaries for prolonged periods plunging thousands of families into misery in a largely civil service state.</p>
      <p>Journalists who covered the election in Kogi with whom I was constantly in touch informed me of the unprecedented level of violence that characterized the election in the state. This was confirmed by several groups of election officials and much of the chaos was also shown on television and ran viral on social media platforms. There is just no way free, fair and credible elections could have taken place in that atmosphere. Could Bello have still won the election without the widespread violence that clearly aided his victory? It is doubtful. The governor’s level of incompetence in terms of performance is highly despicable and condemnable. However, as noted by Eriye, he demonstrated admirable political ability in making amends in aggrieved quarters and cobbling together a coalition of a good number of his former fierce foes.  Even then, winning for Bello in genuinely free and fair elections would have been a camel passing through the eye of a needle.</p>
      <p>Given his combustible temperament and evidently force-inclined disposition, the APC leadership must have considered it a huge risk to field another candidate to contest against Musa Wada in the election with Bello still on seat as the incumbent. There is no indication that Bello cares a hoot about the APC as a party. His loyalty is clearly to President Muhammadu Buhari as a person. In fact, he had reportedly effectively left the APC after losing in the primaries for the 2015 elections and it was only the late Abubakar Audu’s death that landed the plum seat of governor on his laps on the APC platform.</p>
      <p>Had he been denied the return ticket, Bello is the kind of person who would have brought the house down on the party in the election and actively worked for the victory of the opposition in a state where the APC cannot pretend to have the kind of sturdy roots the party has in a state like Lagos. No wonder, the party treated him with kid gloves and an ordinarily arrogant and unyielding Nasir El-‘rufai went on his knees at the campaign rally in Lokoja to beg residents of Kogi to give Bello a second chance. One would have thought that Bello himself would have been flat on his belly in remorse on that occasion. No sir. He was ramrod on his feet, his face as inscrutable as ever! Na dem sabi.</p>
      <p>The PDP’s Musa Wada is also obviously on the way to the Election Petition Tribunal to contest the outcome of the election. Surely, the party has a more solid case to present in court in Kogi than is the case in Bayelsa. But will the courts overturn Bello’s victory? It is highly unlikely going by the trend of election case verdicts in courts in recent times. In any case, here again, the PDP has little moral capital to credibly condemn the manipulation of the elections in Kogi. For, even its own primaries were marred by violence and alleged subterranean manipulations, that made it impossible for the party to contest the election as united as the APC was despite Bello’s gross performance-deficit. And the PDP had been no less eager to deploy its control of the security forces to advantage in elections, just as it alleges the APC did in Kogi, during its 16 years in power.</p>
      <p>But then, does the PDP years of electoral perfidy through its control over the coercive and electoral agencies justify the continuation of the same trend under the APC? The answer is an unambiguous no. For, when it first contested for power at the centre in 2015, the APC presented itself as a party of change. One would have thought that the promised change would also include radical and positive changes in the institutions, processes and mechanisms of conducting elections. What has happened however is that the heavy monetization, outrageous militarization and disputed credibility of elections continues apace even under the APC. Some would argue that the situation has worsened considerably particularly under Professor Mahmood Yakubu’s hugely unimpressive leadership of INEC. The party’s Next Level Agenda must, therefore, be revamped to bring in the implementation of urgent electoral reforms to sanitize elections and raise them to technical and moral levels far higher than obtained under the PDP as an urgent priority.</p>
      <p>If the APC plans to rely on the kind of strong arm tactics witnessed in Kogi to win the next set of elections in Ondo and Edo states, it would have set itself on the self-destructive path trod by the dominant NPC/NNDP coalition in the first republic, NPN in the second republic as well as PDP in the first 16 years of this dispensation. Surely, the ruling party’s leaders are far smarter than to allow history to repeat itself in this regard.</p>
      <p>It is curious that the Inspector General of Police, Mr. Mohammed Adamu, has claimed that the acts of violence perpetrated particularly in Kogi State last Saturday were by fake policemen. So, fake policemen could operate fully armed to disrupt elections in a carefully planned and organized manner in large parts of a state to which the IGP had deployed about 32000 policemen to guarantee security during the elections? Surely, the mastermind behind the admirably efficient operation of these fake policemen in Kogi must be urgently sought and identified – but not for punishment. No. The IGP urgently needs his services as a Special Adviser on security during elections.</p>
