      <p>Elton John has praised his children for giving him a ‘purpose’ in life and helping him to overcome his battle with addiction.</p>
      <p>The music icon has spoken openly of his struggle with substance abuse throughout his career and he didn’t shy away from documenting such struggle in his biopic Rocketman, released earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Elton went into further detail about the tough time he endured while trying to deal with fame in his autobiography, Me: Elton John, and now in a new interview, he has said it was his children that helped him to turn his life around.</p>
      <p>The Crocodile Rock singer is married to husband David Furnish and they share two sons together; Zachary, eight, and Elijah, six.</p>

      <p>Appearing on Lorraine, he said: ‘Ten years ago David said, “You’re going to die on stage, we’re going to be going around the world just two gay guys and having a great time, but not really with any purpose.”</p>

      <p>‘And then, of course, everything turned when we had the children and thank god it did. I wouldn’t have wanted that end to my life like that.’</p>
      <p>Elton continued: ‘I wanted a purpose in my life and I was given a purpose with these two boys and they’ve changed everything. I don’t want to be away from them, I hate being away from them.’</p>
      <p>In the same interview, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/elton-john-says-mentoring-young-artists-like-billie-eilish-lorde-keeps-alive-11199669/">Elton touched on how mentoring young artists, like Billie Eilish, ‘keeps him alive’.</a></p>
      <p>He said: ‘When you hear someone new who is just starting out, it moves you. ‘I always try and make an effort of contacting those kids and having lunch with them and saying, “If you need any advice, I’ve been around since Julius Caesar, please give me a ring, here’s my email, it’s difficult sometimes”.</p>
      <p>‘That keeps me alive. The young give you so much energy.’</p>
