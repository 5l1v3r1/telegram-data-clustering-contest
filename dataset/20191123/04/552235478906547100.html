      <h2>Viet Nguyen Dinh Tuan’s haul of Scotch is worth £10,770,635 as Ho Chi Minh City entrepreneur earns place in Guinness World Records.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Douglas Barrie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/douglas-barrie/</a></address>
      <p>A Vietnamese businessman has been revealed as the owner of the world’s most expensive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/whisky">whisky</a> collection.</p>
      <p>Viet Nguyen Dinh Tuan’s haul of Scotch is worth £10,770,635, say experts at Rare Whisky 101, earning the Ho Chi Minh City entrepreneur a place in the Guinness <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/world-records">World Records</a>.</p>
      <p>The experts said if the whisky was sold at a UK auction, it would attract a buyers’ premium of 21 per cent, valuing it at £13,032,468.</p>
      <p>His collection contains 535 bottles of the rarest and oldest whiskies, locked in his bespoke whisky lounge.</p>
      <p>After collecting for more than 20 years, Viet said it was his “life’s passion”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Every spare moment I get, I’m searching auction sites and trading websites to find famous and rare whiskies.</p>

      <p>“Clearly this requires a lot of patience and no shortage of tenacity but I’m proud of my efforts.</p>
      <p>“As for my collection, I have no intention of selling any of it. Not one bottle.</p>
      <p>“In fact, I’ll continue to hunt for more old and rare bottles and add to and enrich it.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m really happy and feel honoured to be recognised by Guinness World Records as the owner of the world’s most valuable whisky collection. It feels like an acknowledgement of all my hard work over the past 20 years.”</p>
      <p>Viet is believed to be one of possibly three collectors in the world to own all three variants of the Macallan 1926 – Fine and Rare label, the Peter Blake label and the Valerio Adami label.</p>
      <p>A bottle of Fine and Rare sold recently for £1.2million.</p>

      <p>His collection features one of only 12 bottles of the oldest Bowmore – with a bottle fetching £300,000 at auction recently – and one of only 24 bottles of 1919 Springbank, with a bottle selling recently for £220,000.</p>
      <p>Andy Simpson, co-founder of Rare Whisky 101, said: “We were somewhat gobsmacked, not to mention a <br/>little envious, when we realised the breadth and depth of Mr Viet’s collection.</p>

      <p>“It’s a truly stunning example of one person’s 20-year desire to seek out the finest, rarest bottles of whisky.</p>
      <p>“There are well-known whisky collections which contain far more bottles. However, from a pure value perspective, we’re confident this collection is head and shoulders above the rest.”</p>
