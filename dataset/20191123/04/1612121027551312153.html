      <p>Google is working as hard as possible to take the mundane interaction out of phone calls, ordering, and appointments. We’ve already seen it with <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/328394-google-assistant-picks-up-a-ton-of-new-features-including-google-duplex-integration/">Google Duplex phone calls</a>, and it’s beginning to move into things that you <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339849-google-duplex-coming-to-the-web/">do online</a> even without a phone call.</p>
      <p>The latest new feature to <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346261-google-assistant-redesign-pixel-3-rollout/">Google Assistant</a> will allow you to quickly buy tickets on the web. Simply ask Google to look up movie times or something similar, and you’ll be given the option to buy a ticket for the listings. Google has partnered with apps and services like Fandango and theaters directly, like AMC, so once you tap that button the Assistant takes over and walks you through everything.</p>
      <p>Using Duplex, it can navigate the site, punch in your payment info, and get your tickets purchased and ready to go. We’re not sure if this means it can utilize subscription services like the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344073-moviepass-closing-down/">now-defunct MoviePass</a> or AMC A-List, but that’s a challenge for another day.</p>
      <p>Google says car rentals are up next. After that? Who knows.</p>
