      <p>A rough week for Bitcoin is turning into a big hangover at the weekend as the sells keep the pressure on. For the first time in over six months BTC dipped below $7k and further losses are looking likely.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Hits 6 Month Low</h3>
      <p>The 2019 crypto rally is becoming a distant memory as the year draws to a close. Bitcoin has plunged through several levels of support this week and the altcoins have been annihilated as usual. Crypto market capitalization has shrunk by 16% since the same time last weekend.</p>
      <p>It has now dropped below $200 billion which puts digital assets back in crypto winter territory.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">Tradingview.com</a> BTC continued its downward slide and did not stop at $7k. Support was smashed again and the king of crypto fell into dangerous ground with a wick down to $6,800. This is its lowest level since mid-May when things were all in the opposite direction.</p>

      <p>At the time of writing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/bitcoin-support-level-may-spark-explosive-bull-movement-if-its-defended/">BTC had recovered</a> to find ground just below $7,300 but it is unlikely to remain there for long.</p>
      <p>The move has analysts rightly rattled as below these levels there is nothing but a free fall down to $6k or lower.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC moving a bit faster than I thought. Selling climax isn’t here yet imo. Pray that $6,900 holds bc it’s a whole lotta air until ~$6,000 area”</blockquote>

      <p>With all support over the past six months broken, the next level to hold is $6,800. After this is a painful plunge down into the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/wheres-ultimate-bottom-for-bitcoin-plunge-5100-analyst/">high $5k level</a>. It is all shaping up for another crypto winter this winter and hopes are being pinned on the halving next spring to inject some life back into crypto markets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currencies/bitcoin-plummets-to-a-six-month-low-on-china-crackdown-idUSKBN1XW1CO">Reuters</a> have reported that a Chinese crackdown has caused the collapse but this is unlikely because Beijing’s stance on crypto is already widely known.</p>
      <p>Looking at the bigger picture is the only way to find something positive out of the current situation.</p>

      <h3>Altcoins Frozen Over</h3>
      <p>There has been no escaping the digital avalanche and the altcoins have been obliterated as usual. Total market cap dumped to $190 billion which is its lowest level for over six months and a repeat of 2018’s brutal bear market is playing out.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/22/how-does-the-ethereum-dump-affect-defi-markets/">Ethereum</a>, which has been holding up well until yesterday, has been smashed all the way down to $150. ETH has not been in this bad shape for 8 months and more pain is likely to come when Bitcoin falls further. $135 is the next level of support for ETH.</p>
      <p>Ripple’s XRP has dumped to its lowest level since before the 2017 pump. The token is at a two year low of $0.23 as market cap is about to drop below $10 billion. All of the altcoins have been crushed with most losing 7-8% on the day, barreling back to their 2018 bear market lows.</p>
