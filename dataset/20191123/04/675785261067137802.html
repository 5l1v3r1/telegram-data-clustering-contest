      <h1>Chelsea 'to make January move' for Fedor Chalov if transfer ban lifted</h1>
      <h2>Frank Lampard's side expected to target striker who has been linked with Arsenal, Liverpool and Man Utd - if club's appeal against ban is successful next month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:46:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:46</time> by <a rel="author">Gareth Bicknell</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea are reportedly weighing up a January move for striker Fedor Chalov if the club's transfer ban is lifted next month.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> will find out in mid-December whether their appeal against the ban has been successful.</p>
      <p>And if the ban is lifted, Chelsea will target CSKA Moscow striker Chalov, has <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-arsenal-man-utd-chasing-18205871">previously been linked with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>That is according to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11867639/chelsea-interested-in-fedor-chalov-in-january-if-uefa-transfer-ban-is-overturned">Sky Sports</a> , who report that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovic is a fan of his fellow Russian.</p>
      <p>Chelsea, who play champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in a huge Premier League clash on Saturday, have blooded several of the club's talented young players this season after they were banned from making signings.</p>

      <p>Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori have all shown that the future is bright at Stamford Bridge - but Chelsea are still expected to target new recruits in January if their appeal against their transfer ban is successful.</p>
      <p>But they will face competition for Chalov, who has scored five goals so far this season for CSKA in the Russian Premier Liga.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been tipped as Russian football's star of the future with a goal record and lethal finishing ability that is attracting Germany's leading clubs Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and RB Leipzig, as well as French side Monaco and Sevilla of Spain.</p>

      <p>Chalov, who has been at CSKA since he was eight, finished last season as the Russian Premier League's top scorer on 15 goals – two ahead of Zenit St Petersburg's Sardar Azmoun.</p>
      <p>He also weighed in with seven assists to enhance his growing reputation as an attacker who can score and make goals with his eye for a pass, smart decoy runs and awareness of space.</p>
      <p>Chalov signed an improved deal in January that runs until June 2022 – but the talented striker is expected to be a hot property in January and in the summer.</p>
