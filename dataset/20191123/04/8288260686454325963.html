      <h1>John McGinn warning issued as reported Aston Villa target released by club</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa daily digest | here's a rundown of the latest claret and blue stories,</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T04:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <h3>No doubt</h3>
      <p>Dean Smith believes <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> can - and will - keep hold of Scottish goal-scoring sensation John McGinn, beaming: "I have no doubt in my mind."</p>
      <p>McGinn has long been touted with a potential move to Manchester United, with Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce - the man who brought him to Villa Park last summer - admitting this week he's Old Trafford-quality.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, signed for around £2.75m, is in the form of his life having scored 10 goals in his last 20 games for club and country.</p>
      <p>Ginny, as he's known around Bodymoor Heath, fired in another two goals for Scotland during the international break to take his season-tally to double-figures, including three in 12 for Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>The all-action midfielder is believed to be worth more than £50m in today's market and signed a new five-year deal at Villa Park as recently as September.</p>
      <p>Smith, when asked if Villa are expected to keep hold of the likes of McGinn, said: "There's been a lot of speculation about a lot of players, but we've two owners who want to build a football club, challenging at the top half of this table, and top six in a few years' time.</p>
      <p>"To do that you have to keep your best players, and I've no doubts in my mind the owners will want to keep those players."</p>
      <p>Speaking of McGinn, who'll once again start in Villa's engine room on Monday night against Newcastle, Smith added: "He's improving every game he plays, he works hard in training, he's scoring goals at international level as well, so he just need to keep improving.</p>
      <p>"I've no doubt he will because he has a great head on his shoulders, he's an intelligent boy, but on top that he's a really good lad in the dressing room."</p>
      <h3>Released</h3>
      <p>MLS side Chicago Fire have declined to exercise the option on the contract of Nico Gaitan.</p>
      <p>The Argentina international was linked with a move to  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a>  yesterday, with Premier League rivals West Ham United and Sheffield United also said to be interested.</p>
      <p>It  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-ham-transfer-news-gaitan-17295839">has even been claimed that Manuel Pellegrni's side have held preliminary talks</a>  with Gaitan's representatives about a move to the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Gaitan spent the 2019 season with Chicago and the club had an option on his deal for the following season, but they announced early Friday morning that they have declined to take it up.</p>
      <p>The Argentina international scored four time and set up 11 goals in 27 appearances for Veljko Paunovic's side.</p>
      <p>A Boca Juniors academy product, the 31-year-old has also turned out for Benfica, Atletico Madrid and Chinese side Dalian Yifang.</p>
      <h3>DDC</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa have announced a new signing - and they will be in action on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The Digbeth Dining Club will open a location at Villa Park, their first game  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-injury-jack-grealish-17295212">being Monday night's mouth-watering clash with Newcastle United (8pm)</a>  .</p>
      <p>A street food event that opened up in 2012, the Digbeth Dining Club has over 13 locations around the Midlands with their main base on Lower Trinity Street.</p>
      <p>And  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a>  fans will be able to get their hands on some tasty street food before the match with Newcastle, with live music also a feature of Digbeth Dining Club - with the action getting underway two hours before kick-off.</p>
      <p>They announced the news on their Twitter feed on Friday morning, with fans loving the latest addition to Villa Park.</p>
      <p>"Very excited to finally announce that we've partnered up with @AVFCOfficial to enhance their match-day experience," they tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Award-winning street food, live music and more starting this Monday, from 6pm."</p>
      <h3>Personal</h3>
      <p>Aston Villa head coach Dean Smith says he hopes his players don't make Monday night's match against Newcastle United personal.</p>
      <p>It will be the first return of  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a>  to Villa Park since his sacking in October last year after surrendering a 3-1 lead to draw with Preston North End.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Smith</a>  took over from Bruce, who signed Championship play-off final heroes John McGinn and Anwar El Ghazi last summer, and led Villa back to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Now Bruce will bring his Newcastle side to B6 hoping to get one over on his side and beat a potential relegation rival.</p>
      <p>And Smith hopes his players focus on the task at hand and don't get distracted by wanting to beat their old boss.</p>
      <p>"I hope not," Smith said when asked if some of his players will make Monday's match personal.</p>
      <p>"I hope they are just ready for the game and ready to perform to the best of their ability.</p>
      <p>"I don't want them to have any personal feelings about anything, just to concentrate on the game."</p>
      <p>It's not the first time  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a>  have come up against Bruce since his departure from Villa.</p>
      <p>He had a short spell in charge at Sheffield Wednesday before leaving for Newcastle in the summer.</p>
      <p>Villa beat Bruce's Wednesday 3-1 in their April meeting.</p>
      <p>"I said when I took over in the job that I had an awful lot of respect for Steve with what he's done in management but more importantly how he is as a man as well."</p>
