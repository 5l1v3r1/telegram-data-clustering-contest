      <p>Meanwhile, the Congress and the Shiv Sena have taken to Twitter to cry foul after the BJP <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/bjps-devendra-fadnavis-takes-oath-as-maharashtra-cm-ncps-ajit-pawar-his-deputy/273405/">pulled off</a> a political coup in Maharashtra by forming a government with the help of NCP’s Ajit Pawar.</p>
      <p>Randeep Singh Surjewala of the Congress called the development ‘a betrayal of people’s mandate’ as he tweeted, “..Betrayal of people’s mandate. Contract killing of democracy.”</p>

      <p>Sharad Pawar of the NCP said that his nephew had taken the decision on his own and it did not have his blessings. “Ajit Pawar’s decision to support the BJP to form the Maharashtra Government is his personal decision and not that of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). We place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>This was after the BJP stunned its rivals by forming a government with Ajit Pawar. Devendra Fadnavis took the oath of office as the chief minister with Ajit Pawar his deputy. This came hours after the Congress, the NCP and the Shiv Sena deferred their talks in Mumbai to form an alternative government.</p>
      <p>Girish Mahajan of the BJP told reporters that the alliance between the BJP and the NCP was formed after leaders of the two parties held talks in Delhi.</p>
      <p>Sources say that Ajit Pawar may not have joined hands with the BJP without the blessings of his uncle. Sharad Pawar had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week. Although he had said that his meeting was to discuss the farmers’ issues, but he may not have told the whole truth due to political compulsions.</p>
