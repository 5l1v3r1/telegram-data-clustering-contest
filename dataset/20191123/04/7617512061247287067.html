      <p>A new multi-purpose community building and a fenced dog park will be developed in Esquimalt Gorge Park using money provided by the Capital Regional District in return for allowing a sewage treatment plant in the municipality.</p>
      <p>The building, with about 5,000 square feet of space, is to have a design that reflects Japanese architecture and blend in with the revitalized Japanese garden in the park. The building will host park programs and be an events space available for rental. A redesigned parking lot is also part of the plan.</p>
      <p>Gorge Park was once the site of a Japanese teahouse; it was looted and destroyed by vandals during the Second World War.</p>
      <p>Esquimalt Mayor Barb Desjardins called the project an “incredible opportunity” for that part of the municipality.</p>
      <p>“There is no gathering space and this park is a jewel. So to be able to bring people there will definitely add to our community.”</p>
      <p>The CRD is giving Esquimalt $17 million under an agreement allowing the new $765-million regional wastewater treatment plant to be built at McLoughlin Point. Of that amenity fund, $7 million was allocated for waterfront-park enhancements. Staff have told council that at least one project needs to be largely completed by the end of 2020 under the agreement.</p>
      <p>Another $5 million from the amenity fund is going to recreational facilities. The municipality plans to consult the community in the new year about what to do with that money.</p>
      <p>The final $5 million will go to a proposed public-safety building in Esquimalt. Council plans to include an emergency co-ordination centre, commercial space and housing in that project.</p>
      <p>If any of the parks funds are left over, council has earmarked them for a boardwalk at Saxe Point Park, estimated to cost $1.3 million.</p>
      <p>Stantec Consulting was hired to determine preferred options for park improvements in the municipality. The company also drew up a site plan for Esquimalt Gorge Park.</p>
      <p>Esquimalt has published a request for proposals that closes on Dec. 6 for the building design and construction management for the park project. Construction is expected to begin in the spring.</p>
      <p>Advicas Group Consultants Inc. estimated that the new building, including energy-efficient features, reworking the parking lot and landscaping, would cost $5.3 million.</p>
      <p>The dog park is expected to cost $440,000.</p>
      <p>Municipal staff said it will cost about $200,000 annually to operate the building, with revenues of $90,000 expected from rentals and park programs.</p>
      <p>Coun. Ken Armour said he opposed building a new structure in a park where people go to enjoy nature. The building and parking lot will encourage more people to drive during a time of a climate emergency, he said.</p>
      <p>But Coun. Meagan Brame said the building will give residents near the park the ability to walk to programs, rather than drive to the south part of the municipality, thus reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
      <p>The off-leash dog park is to include an area for large dogs, another for small dogs and a shared area. Dog play equipment, benches, double gates at entrances and four parking stalls will be installed.</p>
