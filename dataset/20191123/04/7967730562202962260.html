      <p>“These are very disturbing reports," Mr Frydenberg told reporters on the sidelines of the Victorian Liberal annual conference in Ballarat on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He would not comment on the “particulars of individual cases” but said the revelations did “concern” the government.</p>
      <p>"The matter is now in the hands of the appropriate law enforcement agencies,” he said.</p>
      <p>In explosive revelations published by the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i>, Wang “William” Liqiang details how he was recruited by the Chinese Community Party to conduct espionage activities in Hong Kong and Taiwan and how China seeks to interfere in Australia's democracy.</p>

      <p>Mr Wang has risked his life to expose the Chinese government's clandestine operations and has handed a trove of inside intelligence on how China conducts its interference operations abroad, including in Australia, to Australia's counter-espionage agency, ASIO.</p>
      <p>He faces certain detention and possible execution if he returns to China and is seeking political asylum in Australia, where his wife and young child have been living for some time.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg declined to comment on whether Mr Wang deserved the protection of the federal government.</p>

      <p>“It’s being handled by the appropriate law enforcement agencies,” he said.</p>
      <p>Labor leader Anthony Albanese said while he was yet to be briefed on the matter by government agencies, the reports were "a real concern".</p>
      <p>"We need to make sure that Australia's national sovereignty is protected," Mr Albanese said.</p>
      <p>"We will await processes with the government and one of the things that we will be seeking next week is a briefing from the appropriate authorities on these issues."</p>

      <p>Asked about the impact on Australia's trading relationship with China, he said: "We support human rights. We are a democracy. We support freedom of expression ... Australia has obligations under the principles of the way that we operate as a democracy."</p>
      <p>Mr Albanese said while Mr Wang's asylum application was "a decision for the government", he was "sympathetic with the circumstances".</p>
      <p>"We know that he has outlined a range of activities which clearly put him in a circumstance whereby it's a legitimate claim for asylum," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Frydenberg insisted the government had taken strong measures to tackle foreign interference.</p>
      <p>"I would say the government makes no apologies for the strong measures we have taken to ensure that we have foreign interference laws in place," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are resourcing our law enforcement intelligence agencies, like never before, and we will always stand up for our national interests, whether it's on foreign policy, foreign investment or other related issues."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Department of Home Affairs would not reveal the status of Mr Wang's asylum application, saying the department "does not comment on individual cases".</p>
      <p>"The purpose of protection visas is to safeguard people who cannot return to their home country due to a well-founded fear of persecution or risk of harm," the spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>"Each case is assessed on its merits, using the most current and relevant information, and in light of the requirements set out in the Migration Act 1958 and relevant international treaties."</p>
      <p>Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said authorities must "give the strongest consideration" to Mr Wang's circumstances.</p>
      <p>"I have no doubt in my mind that he would be the subject of severe consequences were he to return to China," Senator Patrick said.</p>
      <p>Comment has been sought from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Marise Payne referred questions on the matter to Mr Dutton's office.</p>
