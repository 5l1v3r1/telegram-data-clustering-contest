      <p>A mother has told how she “wanted to die” after being wrongly accused by staff at a scandal-hit hospital of trying to murder her disabled daughter.</p>
      <p>Kirsteen Cooper was arrested and placed in a cell overnight after staff at the Royal Hospital for Children (RCH) in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow</a> wrongly accused her of stealing blood from her daughter Baillie to make her anaemic.</p>
      <p>She was wrongly suspected of fabricated or induced illness, a controversial condition, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, which theorised that some mothers harm their children to draw attention to themselves.</p>
      <p>Kirsteen said: “I was in disbelief as to how this could this be happening to an innocent person. I can never explain the pain I felt. I wanted to die. I was terrified. I couldn’t stand it, locked up, lying on a cell floor with nothing but a brick wall and a toilet.</p>
      <p>“How could anyone possibly think I could have hurt my child? My children are my life and there could be nothing worse than to be accused of that.”</p>

      <p>Baillie, who turns seven today, uses a wheelchair, has <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cerebral-palsy">cerebral palsy</a> and has to be fed by tubes into her gut and artery.</p>
      <p>She was a patient at the RCH, part of the £842million <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queen-elizabeth-university-hospital">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital </a>(QEUH) in Glasgow, which is the focus of a public inquiry over safety fears and patient deaths from infections.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the hospital’s controlling health board, NHS Great Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), was placed under “special measures” which will allow for greater supervision of its operation and performance.</p>
      <p>As a result of the allegations levelled against mum-of-three Kirsteen, she endured a harrowing two years of limited access to Baillie amid threats she would be placed in foster care.</p>
      <p>Yet, throughout all investigations, Kirsteen continued to care for her other two young daughters at home, with no restrictions.</p>

      <p>Medical watchdog, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) are now investigating a formal complaint from the Cooper family regarding a staff member from NHSGGC’s child protection services, who they claim was central to their ordeal.</p>
      <p>The criminal case against Kirsteen was dropped after a world-renowned consultant haematologist from Alderhey Hospital in Liverpool said Baillie’s anaemia was caused by her complex illness, a diagnosis later backed by the child’s own consultant at the RCH.</p>
      <p>Baillie, who had a complicated medical history since birth, was only four when she was admitted to RCH in December 2016, after a six-month period of regular infections and stays in hospital.</p>
      <p>In the submissions to the NMC, Kirsteen said the Child Protection Service’s (CPS) investigation only came to light on January 26 2017, following a formal complaint from the family to the hospital about the medical care of Baillie and the hygiene of her ward room.</p>
      <p>In a statement to the NMC, Kirsteen said the hospital could respond to her concerns as there was child protection involvement.</p>

      <p>On February 2, 2017, Baillie’s feeding tube leaked and was quickly fixed with no consequence.</p>
      <p>But Kirsteen was accused by staff of tampering with it and then removed from hospital by police  and social workers.</p>
      <p>She said no concerns regarding her family’s handling of Baillie’s care had been raised with them before the dramatic intervention.</p>
      <p>In a sworn affidavit accompanying the complaint to the NMC, she described being torn from her child as “horrendous”.</p>
      <p>Kirsteen said: “She had to be prised off me by my mum while I fell to the floor. I could hear her screaming from outside the ward.”</p>
      <p>Baillie had barely ever been apart from her mother but the following day, Kirsteen was allowed only two hours contact and wasn’t allowed to cuddle her daughter without supervision.</p>
      <p>She said Baillie seemed like a “prisoner” during that period of restricted visits in hospital.</p>
      <p>Kirsteen added: “Every day was distressing for her and she screamed and clung to me every time we had to leave.</p>
      <p>She screamed, ‘I just want my mummy’. It was heartbreaking.”</p>
      <p>Kirsteen’s mother stayed overnight with Baillie, who was then only three, and they have a video, which shows Baillie inconsolable and begging for her mother.</p>

      <p>Kirsteen claimed: “She would wake up numerous times every night, crying for me. She was scared. During her time in hospital she was isolated in a cubicle as she wasn’t allowed out due to child protection restrictions.</p>
      <p>“As she can’t walk or stand unaided, she used to crawl to the room door and watch the other kids play.</p>
      <p>She was like a prisoner. Her emotional well-being were never taken into account. She was traumatised.”</p>
      <p>Contact was gradually increased to 11 hours leading up to her discharge in May 2017, when Baillie was released on condition she stay with Kirsteen’s mum and sister.</p>
      <p>In July 2017, Kirsteen was arrested, taken to Motherwell Police Station and charged with the attempted murder of Baillie.</p>
      <p>She was put in a cell overnight and placed on suicide watch because she was so distressed.</p>
      <p>Kirsteen said:” I couldn’t believe what was happening. I was devastated. I felt empty, like my life had been taken from me.</p>
      <p>“How could anyone possibly think I could have hurt Baillie? I can never explain the pain I felt.”</p>
      <p>She said she felt utterly “degraded”, lying weeping on a concrete floor, being watched by a camera and having to ask for basic necessities like toilet paper.</p>
      <p>She said: “I lay looking round the cell thinking of a way to end my life as it’s the only way to take the pain away. I was terrified.</p>
      <p>All I wanted was Craig and my girls.”</p>
      <p>At 6.30am the next day, she was handcuffed, locked in a van and taken to Glasgow Sheriff Court, where she was again was placed in a cell on her own for several hours.</p>
      <p>But she didn’t have to appear in court and was returned to Motherwell Police Station and released on bail to appear the following month.</p>

      <p>Kirsteen said: “When I was released, I fell into Craig’s arms in tears.</p>
      <p>I will never shake off the feeling of fear. I heard the noise of slamming doors every time I shut my eyes.”</p>
      <p>The criminal case against Kirsteen was dropped and, after more than two years of allegations hanging over them, Kirsteen was vindicated at a Child Referral Hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court in December last year.</p>
      <p>She said, although her family are now together again, they can never recover from the pain of the suspicion and separation they endured.</p>
      <p>In the written complaint, Kirsteen said: “My life has been changed for something I didn’t do.</p>
      <p>Our whole family have suffered and honestly do not think we will ever get over it and I worry about the long term effect on Baillie.”</p>
      <p>Last night, an NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said it had now been informed no criminal proceedings are being taken against Kirsteen.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said: “This was a complex multi-agency child protection matter, which has been the subject of lengthy police investigation.</p>
      <p>“Pending conclusion of those investigations, it would not have been appropriate to respond to the family’s complaint.</p>
      <p>“The board acknowledges that intimation of a NMC referral has been received by them, relating to one of their employees.”</p>
