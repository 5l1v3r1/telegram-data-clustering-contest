      <p><b>WORCESTER, Mass.Â (AP)</b> - Historians in Massachusetts have recognized two Boston Tea Party participants.</p>
      <p>The Telegram &amp; Gazette reports historical reenactors and Boston Tea Party Ships &amp; Museum representatives placed plaques Thursday on the Worcester graves of Peter Slater Jr. and Benjamin Tucker Jr. The museum's Evan O'Brien says they were "just as important to our region's history as Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and John Hancock."</p>
      <p>American colonists protesting "taxation without representation" in December 1773 dumped 340 chests of imported tea into Boston Harbor, a key event leading to the American Revolution.</p>
      <p>O'Brien says not much is known about the more than 100 believed participants, but a large percentage were common tradesmen, young adults and apprentices. The museum hopes to mark known participants' graves before the event's 250th anniversary in 2023.</p>
