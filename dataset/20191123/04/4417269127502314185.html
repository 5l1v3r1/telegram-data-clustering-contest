      <p>Well done to Doreen Salmond, Marion Crouch, Heather Brown and Brian Masters who came fourth out of 40 teams in the Port Natal fund raiser at Stella Park on the weekend. Keep checking the board for carded games. Because of all the rain there is quite a backlog of honours board competitions, so play as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>At TGIF, Pete Shepard won the 100 board. André Beetge was not present for the members draw; next week’s draw will be worth R500.</p>
      <p>Brian Masters was unlucky and did not choose the winning key; next week’s lucky key will be worth R8 810.</p>
      <p>Many happy returns go this week to Talla Stephens-Viviers, Debbie Gueffroy and Dennie Denysschen.</p>
      <p>Good health is wished to all the members.</p>
