      <p>Ayodhya, home to the site believed to be Lord Ram’s birthplace, is chock-a-block with temples of the deity. With the Supreme Court paving the way for building a grand <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ram-temple">Ram temple</a> at the disputed site after pronouncing its verdict in one of India’s longest-running legal battles, preparations are on in the holy city for the mega project.</p>
      <p>But even as devotees await construction of the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi, dozens of other, lesser-known temples across <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ayodhya">Ayodhya</a> are likely to remain sociopolitically significant as they are associated with particular castes.</p>
      <p>Called ‘jatiye mandir’ (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/caste-based-temples">caste-based temples</a>) in local parlance, most such temples have priests as well as management committee members from the particular castes and predominantly attract devotees from these castes. Barring a few, most of these temples are located in the main areas of the city.</p>
      <p>Consider, for instance, Ram Janki Rajakvansh Dhobi Panchayat Mandir, which came into existence more than a century ago in Raiganj locality. “Long before Independence, this temple was established by Maharaj Lallu Dasji to serve the religious interest of people belonging to the Dhobi caste,” said Chhatradas, the mahant of the temple. “During pre-Independence days, it was a difficult task for our castemen, who visited Ayodhya from different areas to offer their prayers, to get shelter in the city. Maharaj Lallu Dasji was deeply concerned about the problems faced by devotees belonging to our caste in finding a place to stay in the city. So, he collected donations to establish this temple and people from our caste would stay here,” he said.</p>

      <p>Chhatradas said the temple, which has its own source of income in agricultural land and is run by a management committee, attracts devotees from Mumbai, Delhi and different parts of Bihar, apart from the neighbouring districts of UP. Devotees often stay in Ayodhya for at least a week so that they can offer their prayers in different old temples across the city, he said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Ayodhya has Pasi Mandir, Akhil Bhartiya Panchahati Kurmi Mandir, Shri Vishwakarama ka Panchayati Mandir, Akhil Bhartiya Halwai Kanya Kubja Vishya Shri Ayodhyaji Mandir, Shri Vishwakarmaji Ka Panchahati Mandir and Kanya Kubja Vaishyabhuj Panchahayati Shri Ram Janki Mandir associated with specific castes.</p>

      <p>While <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Yadav">Yadav</a> Panchayati temple has idols of Radha Krishna, other such temples have idols of Shree Ram Janaki. Another such jatiye mandir is Radha <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/krishna-ventures-ltd/stocks/companyid-4844.cms">Krishna</a> Yadav Panchayat Mandir in Kaithana area. “Our priests are always from the Yadav caste. We have a 14-member management committee to run the temple,” said Umesh Yadav, vice president of the temple management committee. According to Yadav, the temple was established before 1936.</p>

      <p>“We have a good space outside the temple which we offer to people of other castes for holding functions like marriage celebrations. We charge a meagre amount for the allotment of this space for such functions,” he said.</p>
      <p>Yadav said the temple committee offers permanent membership to people from his caste. “We want to get associated with rich people of our caste to ensure better management of the temple. We collect donations also,” he said.</p>
      <p>A few kilometres away is Khatik Ram Janki Panchayati Mandir, located in Muraitola. “This temple was established by our ancestors more than 100 years ago,” said Naresh Sonkar, member of the temple’s management committee. “I belong to the fourth generation of my family associated with this temple. The management committee holds its meeting every month. We have hired a priest from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Brahmin">Brahmin</a> caste for performing regular puja at the temple.”</p>

      <p>Another such temple is Shri Nishad Vansh Prachin Mandir in Bariyari tola, said to be built in early 1900. “I am from Nishad caste. This temple belongs to our community,” said Tulsidas, the priest of the temple. He said the temple, spread over 2.5 bighas of land, has a management committee comprising 21 members and its source of income is mainly donations.</p>
      <p>According to him, devotees from the Nishad caste generally stay in this temple during their visit to Ayodhya. “Generally, devotees come to Ayodhya on the occasion of Shrawan Mela and Kartik Purnima and take bath in the Saryu river,” said Tulsidas.</p>
      <p>The Maurya caste has its own Ram Janki Murao Panchayati Mandir complete with a hostel for students named Samrat Chandragupta Maurya Chhatrawas. “Ayodhya is the city of Lord Ram. Hamare purkhon ne is mandir ko Ayodhya mein banaya (Our ancestors built this temple in Ayodhya). Devotees from our caste mainly come to this temple for their stay in Ayodhya,” said Udhav Das, 85, who has been serving as the temple priest for the past 26 years.</p>

      <p>“This temple has no big source of income. But it receives small donations.” Patwa Vaishya Panchayati Mandir is another such temple. “Most of the devotees from Patwa castes prefer to spend the first day of the New Year in this city. This temple has more than 10 rooms. Apart from UP, devotees from Mumbai and Bihar also visit this temple,” said Satyendra Shastri, the temple priest. Ram Janki Swarnakar Mandir is a relatively recent addition to the list of temples in Ayodhya, as it was built in 1970.</p>
      <p>Satyendra Verma, the temple priest, said members of his family’s previous generation built this temple for the Swarnakar or goldsmith community after they visited Ayodhya and saw temples run by different castes in the holy city.</p>
