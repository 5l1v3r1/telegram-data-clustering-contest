      <p>Moments after BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath as Maharashtra's chief minister Saturday morning, the BJP came out all guns blazing against its former ally - Shiv Sena - and said the party should now keep quiet.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut should "now at least keep silent". "He has ruined the Shiv Sena," Patil said.</p>
      <p>Sanjay Raut, a key Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP, had been very vocal criticising the BJP in the past two weeks and took personal digs at Devendra Fadnavis, saying he is hungry for power.</p>

      <p>Attacking the Shiv Sena, Chandrakant Patil said the party "betrayed" the mandate given to the pre-poll alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>"People voted for BJP-Shiv Sena alliance and we got 161 MLAs, but Shiv Sena betrayed the mandate. Since the first press conference they had started talking about alternatives," Patil said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BJP leader Girish Mahajan said the BJP will prove its majority with the support of over 170 MLAs on the floor of the Maharashtra assembly.</p>

      <p>"Ajit Pawar has given a letter to Governor BS Koshiyari about support of his MLAs and as he is NCP's legislative party leader. This means all NCP MLAs have supported us," Girish Mahajan said.</p>
