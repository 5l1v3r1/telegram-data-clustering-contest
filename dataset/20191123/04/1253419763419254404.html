      <p>3D Realms and 1C Entertainment have announced that their dark fantasy horror FPS which is using the original Quake engine, WRATH: Aeon of Ruin, is now available on Steam Early Access. In order to celebrate this announcement, 1C Entertainment released a new trailer that you can find below.</p>
      <p>WRATH launches in Early Access with the first of three non-linear Hub worlds and two unlocked levels. Annihilate the horrors lurking within the ruins of the Old World with an arsenal of devastating weaponry and mystical artifacts. Early Access will continue to receive content updates that add even more levels, enemies, weapons and artifacts. Furthermore, the game will receive music by Quake Champions composer Andrew Hulshult.</p>
      <p>Frederik Schreiber, Vice President of 3D Realms and Producer on WRATH, said:</p>
      <blockquote>“At 3D Realms we want to evoke nostalgia from the golden era of gaming using classic FPS engines, but with a modern twist. With the incredible Quake engine as our vessel and developer Jeremiah ‘KillPixel’ Fox at the helm, shooter fans are in for a twisted ride.”</blockquote>
      <p>3D Realms aims to fully release the game in Summer 2020.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
