He beat a tougher field in his handicap debut so if jockey Corner Orffer can get him to reproduce a similar performance in this event, he will make light work of this lot.

      <p>Kenilworth 23-11-19</p>
      <p>Best Bet</p>
      <p>Race 4 No 2 Golden Tractor</p>
      <p>Golden Tractor was starting to get rather costly to follow, but he seems to have finally turned the corner and will attempt to register a third consecutive victory.</p>
      <p>He beat a tougher field in his handicap debut so if jockey Corner Orffer can get him to reproduce a similar performance in this event, he will make light work of this lot.</p>
      <p>Golden Tractor beat Skidoo on that occasion and although it will not be easy, Golden Tractor looks classy enough to confirm superiority despite the fact that rival is 2.5kg better off this time.</p>
      <p>Bargain Bet</p>
      <p>Race 2 No 13 What A Flirt</p>
      <p>Although still a maiden, What A Flirt has performed exceptionally well enough in both outings to suggest she is a decent sort in the making.</p>
      <p>This three-year-old daughter of Dynasty followed up her promising debut third with an extremely unlucky second over this course and distance.</p>
      <p>She ran on touch too late and was beaten the whisker margin of 0.05 lengths by Peace Flower. She was probably beaten by the wide draw more than anything else on that occasion.</p>
      <p>From an advantageous No 5 draw she should finally shed her maiden tag.</p>
      <p>Turffontein Standside 23-11-19</p>
      <p>Best Bet</p>
      <p>Race 1 No 3 Akwaan</p>
      <p>Since failing to justify hotpot favouritism on the first time of asking, three-year-old colt has been threatening to leave the maiden ranks, finishing third in two consecutive appearances.</p>
      <p>Despite returning from a five-month rest, Akwaan was backed up to 15-4 favouritism most recently.</p>
      <p>He looked the winner passing the 300m marker, but signs of ring-rust quickly began to show once pressured by opposition. She finished a commendable 3.50 lengths behind Stone Of Judgement over 1400m.</p>
      <p>Callan Murray’s mount is highly rated by the yard and now that he has fitness in his corner, he should improve more than the margin he was beaten by.    </p>
      <p>Bargain Bet</p>
      <p>Race 9 No 9 Tallinn</p>
      <p>Highly rated Tallinn from the Mike de Kock yard was on an impressive three-run winning streak, before tasting defeat for the first time in the Graham Beck.</p>
      <p>She was extremely unlucky. She clipped heels turning for home and stumbled badly – almost dislodging her rider – which forced Callan Murray to pull her out of the race. Two winners have come out of that form line and being a daughter of Vercingetorix, she should relish the step up to 1600m.</p>
      <p>This is a massive step in class for her, so she will need to be at her very best to beat stable companion Gin Fizz.</p>
