      <p>Former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE </a>Universal Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a> recently sat down with Tone Kapone and discussed a bunch of Pro Wrestling topics. While talking about fan experiences, Rollins shared a story of a fan, who once came to his home.</p>
      <p>Rollins has had an incredible 2019, and spent a significant part of the year holding the Universal title. Rollins' popularity took a hit among the fans though, after he dubbed WWE as the best Pro Wrestling on the planet a while ago. This resulted in a Twitter feud against NJPW's Will Ospreay, which didn't end well for Rollins. His feud with <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">The Fiend</a> didn't do him any favors too, as the fans clearly favored Bray Wyatt's alter-ego in this rivalry.</p>

      <p>When asked whether he has had any "wow fan experiences", Rollins shared a scary story of a fan coming to his home.</p>
      <blockquote>"I had a woman come to my house, and you know social media is crazy. This woman showed up at my house not long ago, twice... yeah two times. I had to call the police on her. Yeah, pretty intense, she was from Nebraska or something... driven there like intense... to be in a relationship with me."</blockquote>
