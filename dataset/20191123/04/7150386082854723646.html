      <p>Four persons have been arrested for their alleged involvement in cricket betting related to the ongoing India-Bangladesh pink-ball Test at the <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/eden-gardens">Eden Gardens</a>, a senior police officer said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Acting upon credible information, three persons were arrested from Brindaban Basak Street under Jorabagan police station on Friday evening for running a racket using cricket betting app in their mobile phones, city police Joint Commissioner (Crime) Murlidhar Sharma said.</p>
      <p>The troika — Kundan Singh, 22, Mukesh Mali, 32, and Sanjoy Singh, 42, — were grilled and following their statement another accomplice Md. Sarjil Hossain, 22, was arrested from New Market area.</p>
      <p>Four mobile phones, two computer sets, cash worth Rs 2,05,000 and a notebook were seized from the accused, Sharma said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, captain <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/virat-kohli">Virat Kohli</a> remained unbeaten on 59 while his deputy <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/ajinkya-rahane">Ajinkya Rahane</a> was on a confident 23 as <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/india">India</a> made 174/3, ahead by 68 runs at stumps on the opening day of their maiden Pink Ball Test – the second Test against <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Friday.</p>
      <p>Opting to bat, India’s pacer bowling contingent led by Ishant Sharma steamrolled through the opposition batting order to bundle them out for a paltry 106.</p>
      <p>Ishant, who bagged his 10<sup>th</sup> five-wicket haul in Tests, returned figures of five for 22 and was ably supported by Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami as they shared the remaining five wickets between them.</p>
      <p>It was a horrible day for Bangladesh who had more trouble than expected when wicketkeeper-batsman Liton Das was forced to withdraw from the game after being struck by a bouncer from Shami. Liton retired hurt on 24 at tea and was later replaced by concussion sub Mehidy Hasan.</p>
