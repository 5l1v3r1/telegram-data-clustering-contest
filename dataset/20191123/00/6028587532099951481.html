      <h1>Travel Booking Giant Leaks 1TB Of Data Including Customer Credit Cards</h1>

      <p>Yet another major data leak has been discovered by security researchers. This time a misconfigured server spilled more than a terabyte of data on corporate and leisure travelers – and that data included their payment card details.</p>

      <p>Two weeks ago, a team from vpnMentor led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar happened upon the exposed database. They immediately started combing through its contents to discover who the server belonged to.</p>
      <p>The answer: France-based Gekko Group, a subsidiary of AccorHotels that bills itself as leading European hotel booking platform. Comprised of multiple brands, Gekko Group boasts connections to 14,000 travel agents and 600,000 hotels around the world.</p>
      <p>vpnMentor’s researchers found a number of files on the exposed server linked to two Gekko Brands: Infinite Hotel, which deals in wholesale hotel bookings, and Teldar Travel, a full-service B2B travel platform that handles everything from lodgings to car rentals and excursions.</p>
      <p>The data exposed was extensive: customer names, email address, physical addresses, travel dates and destinations. More alarmingly, vpnMentor also discovered unencrypted payment card details and usernames and passwords (also unencrypted) used by Gekko Group clients to access its booking platforms.</p>
      <p>vpnMentor notes in its report that the data could have allowed someone to rack up fraudulent charges on corporate and personal credit cards. That may not have happened in the last two weeks, but the database could have been exposed well before vpnMentor’s researchers discovered it.</p>
      <p>More sophisticated attackers may have utilized the exposed information in spearphishing attacks, targeting travel agents with malware or business email compromise (BEC) scams.</p>
      <p>Regardless of when the misconfiguration occurred, vpnMentor says “it represents a serious lapse in the data security protocols of Gekko Group and its subsidiaries,” adding that there are “ with serious implications for the many people affected.”</p>
      <p>That doesn’t just mean travelers, who may have to cancel credit cards and sign up for credit monitoring or identity protection services in the aftermath.</p>
      <p>Though the leak was plugged within a week of vpnMentor’s initial notification, the story is far from over for the Gekko Group. France’s regulatory body for data and privacy, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés will want some answers. Investors will, too.</p>

        <i>AccorHotels has been contacted regarding the vpnMentor report and this post will be updates with its response.</i>
