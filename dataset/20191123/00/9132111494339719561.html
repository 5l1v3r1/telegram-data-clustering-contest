      <p>President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo will decide if the December 17 referendum will be held or not, 3news.com has gathered.</p>
      <p>The President will make the all-important decision when he returns from his trip to the UK on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview on The Key Points on TV3 and 3FM, Deputy Minister of Local Government and Rural Development Osei Bonsu Amoah said there appears to be a breakdown in consensus on the referendum, particularly after the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) decided to go for a ‘No’ vote.</p>
      <p>He said there was an overwhelming support for a ‘Yes’ vote during consultations ahead of the exercise.</p>
      <p>The Akuapem South Member of Parliament said many called for the introduction of politics in district level elections with the ultimate aim of the election of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs).</p>
      <p>“Seventy-five per cent or more was going for a ‘Yes’ vote until the major opposition party came in.”</p>
      <p>Since the NDC came out with its position, there has been divided opinion on the votes.</p>
      <p>While some back government’s position of a ‘Yes’, others want a ‘No’ outcome with the pretext of preserving the sanctity of the district level elections.</p>
      <p>The National House of Chiefs is also divided along those lines, raising concerns about the front of Ghana’s traditional authority.</p>
      <p>But OB Amoah says the president’s decision will put paid to the way forward regarding the holding of the referendum as already there are calls for its withdrawal.</p>
      <p>“Then, we carry on. That’s the decision now.”</p>
