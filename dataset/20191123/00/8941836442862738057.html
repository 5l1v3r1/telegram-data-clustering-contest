      <p>CLARKSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Two bodies discovered in a home in western New York allegedly set on fire by a 17-year-old reportedly were his parents.</p>
      <p>State police say <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/william-j-larson-jr/">William J. Larson Jr.</a> has been arraigned on charges of second-degree murder and first-degree manslaughter.</p>
      <p>The bodies were found Thursday in the rural Allegany County town of Clarksville.</p>
      <p>WIVB-TV in Buffalo reports the victims were identified as 50-year-old Lisa Larson and 67-year-old William Larson Sr. - the younger <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/william-j-larson-jr/">Larson</a>’s parents. State police told WIVB that their deaths may not have been a result of the fire and appeared suspicious.</p>
      <p>Calls from The Associated Press to state police were not returned on Saturday.</p>
