      <p>The government said 147 people were currently in hospital because of the measles, including 11 children who were in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>The majority of them are at the main hospital in the capital, Apia.</p>
      <p>It said there had been 1644 cases of measles recorded in the country since the outbreak started last month.</p>
      <p>The country is in a state of emergency, with schools closed, a mass vaccination campaign under way, and public gatherings restricted.</p>
      <p>Nearly 89 percent of the cases are on the main island, Upolu, and restrictions are in place on travel between the two islands, including a ban on children under the age of 19.</p>
      <p>All but one of the recorded deaths have been children; nine under the age of one, and 10 between the ages of one and four.</p>
