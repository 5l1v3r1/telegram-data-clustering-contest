      <p><b><i>UK prince says the world has ability to change course, but it must act fast as we have already reached a tipping point</i></b> <br/><br/>Britain's Prince Charles warned on Friday that time is running out to address the impact of climate change as he prepares to visit one of the Pacific island nations most affected by global warming. <br/><br/>As he wrapped up a six-day trip to New Zealand ahead of three days in the Solomon Islands, Charles said the need for climate action was urgent. "We have reached a tipping point and we still have the ability to change course, but only 10 years," said the first in line to the British throne, who has been a passionate environmentalist for decades. <br/><br/>He said climate change was a scientific fact, rejecting suggestions from sceptics that "scaremongering" was dominating the debate. <br/><br/>"We have abused nature, exploited her and given her nothing back in return," he told an audience at Christchurch's Lincoln University. <br/><br/>"Nothing is sacred anymore, we are reaping a loss of biodiversity and experiencing the impacts of climate changes. We urgently need to pay the mounting debt." <br/><br/>He and wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, will have the chance to see the impact of climate change at close quarters when they make their first visit to the Solomon Islands on Saturday. <br/><br/><br/><b>Sydney among world’s most polluted cities<br/><br/></b>The Australian state of New South Wales was gasping under the worst levels of air pollution ever recorded on Friday as smoke from widespread bushfires caused a spike in hospital visits and hazards including poor visibility for drivers. <br/><br/>Sydney, the country’s most populous city, was blanketed in a thick haze for the fourth consecutive day, pushing it into a rare and repeat appearance in the list of top ten cities with the worst air pollution in the world. <br/><br/><br/>The smoke haze brought particulate pollution, which can be absorbed into the bloodstream, creating what officials said were the highest levels of pollution recorded in New South Wales.</p>
