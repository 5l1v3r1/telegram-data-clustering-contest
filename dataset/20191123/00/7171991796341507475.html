      <h1>A 3D Printer Scratch Built For Your Viewing Pleasure</h1>

      <p>Today it’s almost always cheaper to buy an imported 3D printer kit than it is to source your own parts and build one yourself. But that doesn’t stop people from doing it anyway. Whether they’re looking for something a bit more solid, or just want to do things their own way, there are still valid reasons to design and build your own machine. Luckily for us in the audience, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyYZUiBHD1QjaYx7eCEW8zXvsgwEbAykY">[Rob Mech] decided to document the build of his custom “LayerFused C201” printer</a> on his YouTube Channel.</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of taking the plunge and building a 3D printer <i>exactly</i> the way you want, but were never able to manage the time, this seven video series might be the next best thing. Each video takes you through a different step of the construction, from building the frame out of aluminum extrusion all the way to wiring up the endstop switches and the 32-bit SKR v1.3 controller. There’s even a video that introduces the viewer to the concept of a “Frankenstein” printer that uses cobbled together parts just long enough to produce its own final components.</p>
      <p>All told, [Rob] says the Bill of Materials for the LayerFused C201 comes to <i>at least</i> $200, but that’s going to take shopping around for the lowest possible prices and potentially even salvaging some components from other machines and projects. Like we said, building a cheap printer is absolutely not the goal here; it’s all about <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/07/06/build-a-3d-printer-workhorse/">building a printer you want to use</a>.</p>
