        <b>Anfield stadium is one of very few football temple's left. With more than 130 years of history, it has obviously suffered in various ways and undergone several reforms and updates, but Liverpool seem to have something deeper in mind, to expand its capacity.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the 'BBS', the work will cost <b>more than 100 million euros.</b> "The aim is to create <b>a bigger Anfield</b>, which will allow more fans to watch some of the best games in European football in <b>a world class stadium</b>," Liverpool explained to the British media.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time thay <b>Anfield </b>has faced a reform, but very few times has it done so on such a big scale as this. <b>Anfield is a surviver</b>, and, in this way it is intended that the more than 100 year-old stadium undergoes some changes.</p>
