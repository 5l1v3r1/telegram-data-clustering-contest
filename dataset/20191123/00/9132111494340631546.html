      <p>A pistol belonging to Ghana’s Minister of Railway and Development, Joe Ghartey, has been stolen in his hotel room in the Ashanti region, DailyMailGh.com can reveal.</p>
      <p>The minister and his bodyguard have made a report to the police and investigation is currently ongoing into a suspected burglary in his hotel room.</p>
      <p>The incident happened at Georgia Hotel, a popular lodging facility at Nhyiaeso, about 15 minutes drive from the Kumasi Airport, police sources confirmed to DailyMailGH.com.</p>
      <p>The Minister was said to have lodged in the facility when he arrived in Kumasi at about 6pm Thursday for a working visit at Asokwa.</p>
      <p>The Minister on his return from the trip, detected that the weapon which was loaded with about 10 rounds of ammunition had been made away from his room.</p>
      <p>It is not immediately known whether the burglars made away with other personal effects, but officials of the facility have since been informed of the matter.</p>
      <p>The security detail of the Minister, who also doubles as Member of Parliament for Essikado/Ketan Constituency, have lodged an official complaint to the Ashanti Regional Police Command who have begun investigations into the matter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MPs targeted?</b>
      </p>
      <p>There have been concerns about the safety of public officials, especially Members of Parliament in Ghana.</p>
      <p>The Ashanti Regional Police Command is yet to make an arrest after armed men attacked Nhyiaeso Parliamentarian, Kennedy Kankam, and his family.</p>
      <p>Police say three gunmen held the victims for over three hours before making away with some items from the legislator’s house including a 4-wheel drive vehicle at dawn one Sunday.</p>
      <p>The unidentified assailants reportedly scaled a wall into the main yard of the MP’s residence and used a metal cutter to gain access to the bedroom of the legislator.</p>
      <p>PRO of the Ashanti Regional Police Command, ASP Godwin Ahianyo, said the gunmen succeeded in robbing the MP and his family of an unspecified amount of money, a Land Cruiser vehicle and Pump Action gun.</p>
      <p>Police have since retrieved the vehicle abandoned at Edwinase, about 15-kilometres away from the crime scene, but no arrest has been made yet.</p>
      <p>Also, suspected murder of former Member of Parliament for Abuakwa North, J.B Danquah Adu, in his house at Accra, is yet to be unraveled.</p>
      <p>Two persons are standing trial at a law court in the nation’s capital, Accra.</p>
