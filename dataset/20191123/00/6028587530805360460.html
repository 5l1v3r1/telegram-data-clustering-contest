      <p>Apple’s AirPods will undoubtedly be some of the most sought-after purchases this Black Friday, but which retailer has the best deals?Most of the deals are fairly similar, so if you have a preference for a particular store - perhaps because you have a gift card or loyalty card discount - then shop there. But Walmart appears to have the cheapest pair of second generation AirPods I’ve found so far (without the wireless charging case). </p>
      <p>If you’re in the market for a new smartphone, however, then you could potentially pick up a pair of AirPods for free with one of the gift card deals<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/13/target-black-friday-2019-best-new-phone--tech-deals/#2c169fc8537d"> Target</a> and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/16/walmart-outflanks-target-with-new-black-friday-tech-deals/#1a5687c13717">Walmart</a> are offering - with some money to spare for extra tech.  </p>
