      <h1>Again, Fani-Kayode Urges VP Osinbajo To Resign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>Former Minister of Aviation <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/09/21/buhari-vs-osinbajo-why-tunde-bakare-will-be-a-better-vp-fani-kayode/"><u><b>Femi Fani-Kayode</b></u></a> has called on Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to resign from his position as the nation’s number two citizen.</p>
      <p>The chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was reacting to Osinbajo allegedly flagging off the Use The Toilet campaign.</p>
      <p>The campaign is aimed at putting a stop to open defecation across the country.</p>
      <p>This follows President Muhammadu Buhari’s signing of the Executive Order 009 entitled, ‘The Open Defecation-Free Nigeria by 2025 and Other Related Matters Order’ into law.</p>
      <p>Reacting in a post on Twitter, Fani-Kayode said Oisnbajo will soon be used to “wash toilets.”</p>
      <p>Fani-Kayode wrote: <i>“VP Yemi Osinbajo launches and flags off the Use The Toilet Campaign, a campaign to stop open defecation in Nigeria while Buhari is presiding over a security council meeting!</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“A few days ago I wrote: “If Osinbajo doesn’t resign they will send him to wash toilets”. Almost there!”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Recall that <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/25/osinbajo-may-be-thrown-out-of-aso-rock-villa-if-fani-kayode/"><u><b>Fani-Kayode had warned Yemi Osinbajo</b></u></a> to resign before he is fully disgraced.</p>
      <p>Fani-Kayode noted that the Vice President had already seen his roles reduced to the barest minimum since the second term of the Buhari administration came on stream.</p>
      <p>He, therefore, warned that Osinbajo might be disgraced and ‘thrown out’ of the Presidential Villa anytime soon should he fail to take initiative and voluntarily resign from office.</p>
