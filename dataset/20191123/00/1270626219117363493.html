      <p>Minister for Employment Parveen Bala says he will not be able to disclose details of employment grievances registered by employees of Grace Road Group as they are confidential.</p>
      <p>He says certain matters were reported to the Employment Ministry and majority of them have been settled.</p>
      <p>Bala did not answer questions by Fijivillage on how these matters were settled.Â </p>
      <p>He said a few of the grievances are still being investigated.</p>
      <p>The founder of Grace Road Church Shin Ok-ju was sentenced to six years in prison by the South Korean Court earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Shin Ok-ju convinced her followers to move to Fiji in 2014, claiming they would be safe here from imminent natural disasters.</p>
      <p>Once they arrived, their passports were confiscated and many of them were allegedly subjected to beatings and brutal rituals supposedly aimed at driving out evil spirits.</p>
      <p>She was arrested last July.</p>
      <p>The government has said Fiji has adhered to international law as we cooperated with South Korean counterparts in past investigations, and will continue to do so moving forward to investigate any allegations of breaches of the law.</p>
