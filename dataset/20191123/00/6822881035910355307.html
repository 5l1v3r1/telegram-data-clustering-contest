        <b>New York-based capital market fintech Capitolis has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by Spark Capital and Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) Capital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The start-up’s product connects financial institutions (FIs) across the global market, allowing them to collaborate, more easily detect attractive capital sources and avoid over-utilisation of capacity which can increase costs. Investors see the fintech in a position “to transform a whole industry”.</p>

      <p>Existing backers in the investment round included technology capital funds Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, as well as Tel Aviv-based S Capital, bringing Capitolis’ total funding raised to date to $70 million.</p>
      <p>“We now have the funding, the management team, and the core customer adoption to grow Capitolis into a major industry infrastructure and force,” says the start-up’s executive chairman Tom Glocer.</p>
      <p>Spark Capital, which has funded the likes of Tumblr, Twitter and Slack, will see its partner Jeremy Philips join Capitolis’ board to help grow the investment.</p>

      <p>With offices in London and Tel Aviv alongside its US base, the 2016-founded company was started by ex-Thomson Reuters CEO Glocer, alongside Traiana’s founder and former head of technology Gil Mandelzis and Igor Teleshevsky.</p>
      <p>Investors see the team “on a multi-trillion dollar mission to reduce risk in the global financial system while improving returns”.</p>
      <p>“By connecting all the parties in the market more efficiently, Capitolis removes bottlenecks that are limiting the flow of capital,” says Index Ventures’ partner Jan Hammer.</p>
      <p>“The response from leading banks and other financial players has shown a growing need for such a platform, and we’re excited to continue to support the team as they scale.”</p>
