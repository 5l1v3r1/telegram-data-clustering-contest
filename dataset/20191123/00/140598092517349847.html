      <p>Aboubakar Kamara proved an able deputy for the suspended Aleksandar Mitrovic, scoring his first goals since returning to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fulham-fc/">Fulham </a>this summer to complete a victory that moved Scott Parker’s side up to fourth in the Championship.</p>
      <p>Kamara’s career at Craven Cottage appeared to be over when was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/01/23/aboubakar-kamara-arrested-banned-fulham-training-ground-fight/">arrested following an incident at the club’s training ground </a>in January and sent out on loan to Turkish club Yeni Malatyaspor. He was restored to the squad in pre-season and having been forced to wait for his chance – this was his first league start since the opening day of the season – scored twice after Jordan Hugill had given Queens Park Rangers a third-minute lead.​</p>
      <p>“What happened last season with Abou is well documented but he has come back into the squad with the blessing of the players,” said Parker, the Fulham manager.</p>
      <p>“They are fully on board. He has not been involved this season, he has had his moments but he is a grafter and he works hard and he deserved his goals. I’m really pleased for him.”​</p>
      <p>Hugill finished after home keeper Marek Rodak failed to deal with Todd Kane’s cross and the visitors should have extended their lead during the opening 15 minutes. Parker’s side were in danger of being overwhelmed and had offered little before they found themselves back on level terms when Kamara exploited poor marking in the Rangers defence to head home from Denis Odoi’s cross.​</p>
      <p>The equaliser helped tilt the balance of the game and Fulham assumed control of the game after the restart with Kamara claiming his second in the 64th minute after being set up by Tom Cairney.​</p>
      <p>“I would have been frustrated if we had drawn the game,” said Mark Warburton, the Rangers manager. “So to lose is even more frustrating.”​</p>
