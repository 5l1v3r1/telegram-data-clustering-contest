        <b>Manchester City lost away to Liverpool without injured goalkeeper Ederson, but he is back for Saturday's home game against Chelsea.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Ederson </b>is back in the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> side to face Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper missed City's last game, a 3-1 defeat at Liverpool that left the champions <b>nine points behind Jurgen Klopp's Reds</b> in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Ederson was withdrawn during a Champions League draw with Atalanta this month due to a <b>thigh injury</b>, with <b>Kyle Walker ending the game</b> in goal after Claudio Bravo was sent off.</p>
      <p>The Brazil international has, as expected, been passed fit for a crunch clash with Chelsea, with Frank Lampard's side having won six straight Premier League games to <b>move up to third in the league</b>, above City.</p>
      <p><b>Bernardo Silva</b> is out after being <b>banned for one game</b> for his controversial tweet about team-mate Benjamin Mendy, while <b>Raheem Sterling</b> starts after being dropped for England's 7-0 win over Montenegro during the international break following an incident with Liverpool defender Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>David Silva also returns to midfield, having been an <b>unused substitute against Liverpool, </b>while Riyad Mahrez starts alongside Sterling and Sergio Aguero.</p>
