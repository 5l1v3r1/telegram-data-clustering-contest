      <h1>How to Write a Check</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Michael R. Lewis ✅</a></address>
      <p>Writing checks is an easy and important skill every adult should know. To write a check, fill in the current date on the line in the upper right corner, the name of the recipient in the "Pay" field, the numerical amount next to the dollar sign ($), and the written form of the same amount on the line beneath; sign the check on the bottom right line and consider adding a "memo" about the check's purpose on the lower left line. The more often you write checks, the more natural the process will become.</p>

                  <p><b>2. Write the name of the recipient.</b> Write the name of the person or company you're sending the check to next to the line that says "Pay to the Order of." If it's a company and you're not sure exactly what it's called, make sure you get that information right before you write the check. You can also just pay the check to "Cash," but be careful, because that means that anyone can cash it.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Check#_note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>

If you've written a check for $20.00, write either "Twenty dollars and 0/100 cents," "Twenty dollars even," or just "Twenty" with a line running all the way from the right of the word to the end of the line.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Check#_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

You can write "For May rent" if you're sending a rent check. Also, many companies or landlords require that you provide some other information in the memo section; some companies require you to write your ID number in the "Memo" section, and if you're writing a rent check for your apartment, you should write the apartment # right in the memo section.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Check#_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

                                  <li>Always draw a line if there is still space after you write your amount in word form. This will prevent someone writing in an additional few zeros.</li>
                                  <li>Always sign your name the same way.</li>
                                  <li>Always use a pen in a dark color such as blue or black. Gel pens are recommended because ink removing liquids do not work as well with the gel.</li>
                                  <li>
                                    <p>If you're writing a check that you don't want to be cashed until a certain day, write the day that you'd like it to be cashed. For example, if you're writing a rent check early but don't want it cashed until the first of the month, write that date on the check. Note, however, post dating won't guarantee that the recipient will not be able to cash the check before the date written on the check</p>

                                  <li>Make sure your check is written out correctly with the correct spelling of the name and the correct amount of money due to that person.</li>
                                  <li>When tearing the check from your checkbook, be sure to tear as cleanly as possible. The printed numbers along the bottom of the check, called the MICR line, are necessary for cashing or depositing the check; so is the check number, usually located in the top right near the date. If any of these numbers are partially torn off, the check will be rendered invalid.</li>
                                  <li>Remember that post-dated checks can be deposited immediately. The date is used to determine when a check becomes stale and will be refused by the bank (typically 7 years after the date unless otherwise specified), not the earliest date that the check can be cashed. A lot of people have been burned by unscrupulous people promising to hold onto checks until the specified date(s).</li>
