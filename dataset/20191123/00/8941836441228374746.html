      <p>HOUSTON (AP) - Charlie Booker and Aston Walter had touchdown runs in the first half and Rice held off North Texas for a 20-14 victory on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Owls (2-9, 2-5 Conference USA) led 20-0 at halftime.</p>
      <p>North Texas (4-7, 3-4) capped the scoring on Tre Siggers’ 1-yard touchdown run with 7:32 to play. Larry Nixon III forced a fumble on the ensuing kickoff and Evan Johnson recovered the ball at the Rice 23. But the Mean Green couldn’t capitalize on the turnover when Mason Fine threw an incomplete pass on fourth-and-12 at the Owls 15.</p>
      <p>Walter bulled into the end zone from the 1, Booker scored on an 8-yard run, and Chris Barnes kicked two field goals for Rice. Booker finished with 78 yards rushing on 22 carries.</p>
