      <h4>As press freedom wanes in Egypt, security forces have taken an editor of Mada Masr into custody. The investigative Egyptian newspaper has called for Shady Zalat's release.</h4>
      <p>Security forces on Saturday detained journalist Shady Zalat, according to a <a href="https://madamasr.com/en/2019/11/23/news/u/urgent-statement-regarding-the-arrest-of-mada-masr-colleague-shady-zalat/">statement</a> by the online news portal he worked for, Mada Masr.</p>
      <p>Mada Masr, one of a shrinking number of independent news websites in Egypt, said Shady Zalat was arrested from his home in Cairo.</p>
      <p>The outlet said plainclothes police told Zalat's wife that he was being taken to the Giza police headquarters. </p>

        <b>'Censorship'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mada Masr said Shady is 37 years old and has been working there as an editor since 2014.</p>
      <p>"He has done nothing more than use words to report the news," the statement read. "His arrest marks yet another escalation in the crackdown against journalism in Egypt."</p>
      <p>Mada Masr, which is the Arabic word for "range" or "scope," provides a wide range of content in English ― political and economic in-depth analysis and creative writing as well as investigative journalism, according to Deutsche Welle's DW Akademie.</p>
      <p>The outlet has struggled with censorship because of its critical reporting during and after the 2011 Egyptian revolution. To this end, Mada Masr has been blocked for more than a year without any apparent reasons, part of a campaign by the Egyptian authorities against news websites that they claim "support terrorism," according to <i><a href="https://p.dw.com/p/3PXBv">After the Scoop</a></i>, a DW Akademie report on investigative journalism around the world.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate comment about Shady's detention from Egyptian authorities.</p>
      <p>Egypt is ranked 163 out of 180 countries in the <a href="https://rsf.org/en/2019-world-press-freedom-index-cycle-fear">Reporters Without Borders 2019 Press Freedom Index</a> ― falling two places from the previous year.</p>
