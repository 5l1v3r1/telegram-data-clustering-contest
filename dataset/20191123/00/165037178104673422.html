      <p>"<b>I had just become Osasuna manager and we played in Seville</b>. We were training at the opposition's training ground and I was told that Sevilla youth were playing against Barça", the manager told 'AS'.</p>

      <p>This match left an unexpected mark on Aguirre who witnessed the <b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> superstar being made first hand</b>.</p>
      <p>"I was told 'come here, Javier. <b>There's a youngster that you're going to watch play</b>'. I went and saw him for the first time. He was a rat!" the Mexican said in a kind tone as he recalled the past to the aforementioned source.</p>
      <p><b>"He was a machine (Messi), with long hair. He took the ball and scored. Then again and goal. Almost 20 years later and he's the same or better</b>," Aguirre said about a Messi who continues to beat records with inhuman voracity.</p>
