      <h1>Set-Piece Supremacy Leads Liverpool to Historic Premier League Start After Palace Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15203443" target="_blank">Adam Aladay</a></address>
      <p>​A sub-par Liverpool edged past Crystal Palace 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday, with Roberto Firmino scoring a late winner.</p>
      <p>Reds forward Sadio Mane made it 1-0 early in the second half, but Wilfried Zaha levelled things up with eight minutes remaining. Jurgen Klopp's men pushed for a winner and found it only three minutes later, as Firmino poked home following a corner to ensure his side left with all three points.</p>

      <p>The Brazilian's late strike emphasised once again the threat that the Anfield side pose from set-pieces. Since the start of last season, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> have scored 38 goals from set-piece scenarios in the Premier League (including penalties), eight more than any other club.</p>
      <p>After only six league matches in 2019/20, Klopp's men had already scored four goals from set-pieces and they have continued to assert their dominance in this department. Further to this, the team's latest win has seen them join an elite group in terms of points won at the start of a campaign.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are only the fourth side in English top-flight history to have as many as 37 points from their opening 13 league games to a season (assuming three points for a win), after <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Tottenham</a> in 1960/61, Liverpool themselves in 1990/91 and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">​Manchester City</a> in 2017/18.</p>

      <p>Further to this, <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6503184-crystal-palace-1-2-liverpool-report-ratings-reaction-as-reds-win-in-controversial-fashion">​Saturday's win</a> means the club's current <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6500084-liverpool-could-join-elite-unbeaten-group-by-avoiding-defeat-against-crystal-palace">30-game undefeated</a> streak is only outmatched by two sides in the Premier League era. This is also the first time they have managed this feat in their history. </p>
      <p>It may not have been a vintage display by the Reds, but they picked up a valuable three points to maintain their eight-point lead at the top of the table. </p>
