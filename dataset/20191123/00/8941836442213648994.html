      <p>DALLAS (AP) - Joe Pavelski and Tyler Seguin scored in a shootout, and the surging <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Dallas Stars</a> beat the Chicago Blackhawks 2-1 on Saturday night for their sixth consecutive victory.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> is 10-0-1 during an 11-game point streak.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> goalie Anton Khudobin stopped Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane in the tiebreaker. Khudobin equaled his season high with 38 saves, including one on a breakaway by Patrick Kane in overtime.</p>
      <p>Roope Hintz scored for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> and Olli Maatta for the Blackhawks in the first period.</p>
      <p>Chicago had two possible goals disallowed in the third.</p>

      <p>Just 2½ minutes into the period, a long video review confirmed a call of no goal after Khudobin stopped a close-up wrist shot by Dominik Kubalik and two other attempts to poke in the puck by David Kampf and Andrew Shaw.</p>
      <p>With three minutes to play, Dylan Strome redirected Maatta’s shot from the left point into the net. The ruling that the puck went off a high stick was upheld following a review.</p>
      <p>Chicago goalie Robin Lehner had 40 saves.</p>
      <p>A pair of <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> just off injured reserve combined for the game’s first goal at 14:08 of the first period. In front of the net, Hintz deflected John Klingberg’s shot from the blue line past Lehner to become the first <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> player with 10 goals this season.</p>

        <p>Maatta tied it with his first at 17:24. He took a cross-ice pass from Alex DeBrincat in the left faceoff circle, and Maatta’s wrist shot went in off Khudobin’s left leg.</p>
        <p>Nobody scored in the second period, even though each team had two power plays. It ended with two <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> and a Blackhawks player in the penalty boxes. Shots on goal for the teams over the first two periods were 25 each.</p>
        <p>Khudobin also stopped a snap shot by Zach Smith on a 2-on-1 break with nine minutes to play.</p>
        <p>By then, the game had swung back in the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>’ direction. Chicago killed a penalty, and with 5:39 left <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a>’ Jason Dickinson shot wide from short range.</p>
        <p>NOTES: Hintz had missed seven games, and Klingberg sat out six. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> killed off all four Blackhawks power plays and has been successful on 34 of 37 penalty kills in the past nine games. Chicago’s power play is 1 for 17 in the last six. … Kane assisted on Maatta’s goal to extend his point streak to 12 games. In 59 career games against the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a>, Kane has 59 points (28 goals, 31 assists). He has more goals vs. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas/">Dallas</a> than any other team, with highs of 38 assists and 62 points against St. Louis. Kane has at least a point per game against 17 teams. … <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dallas-stars/">Stars</a> C Justin Dowling left the game late in the second period with an upper body injury and didn’t return.</p>
