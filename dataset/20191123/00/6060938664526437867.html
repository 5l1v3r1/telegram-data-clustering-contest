      <p>NEW DELHI: The Reserve Bank India is looking to introduce <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/new-rules-on-corporate-governance">new rules on corporate governance</a> for banks in sync with global ones, and would also like lenders to disclose more, deputy governor N S Vishwanathan said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Vishwanathan also urged banks to recognise losses because of NPAs as early as possible and not to defer the same. The comments from the top central banker comes at a time when the system continues to go through the issues of asset quality, even though the new additions have slowed down.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an event, Vishwanathan listed out a slew of initiatives the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Reserve-Bank-of-India">RBI</a> has undertaken, with the compensation structures for key management personnel and whole-time directors being the latest additions, and hinted that it is looking at more. “The Basel Committee (where bankers from all over the world discuss strategies) has its own (framework on corporate governance), we are working on that to improve guidelines on that,” Vishwanathan said.</p>
      <p>He said the new guidelines will be put in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/public-domain">public domain</a> and the RBI will be seeking comments before finalising any rules.</p>
      <p>Citing the case of under-reporting of NPAs which used to go unrecognised earlier and is made compulsory now, and the benefits it gets, the DG urged banks to disclose as much as possible to present a truthful picture. “The default should be disclosed as much as I can so long as I am not hitting a provision of law or I am not providing a market strategy that is taking the bank forward,” he said.</p>
      <p>He also said that the central bank agrees with capital markets regulator Sebi’s call on disclosure of divergences immediately by a bank and not waiting till the annual report, because this is price-sensitive information. Vishwanathan also said that the banks should be working the most on governance practices in order to avoid any difficulties.</p>
