      <p><b>MINISTER with responsibility for education, youth and information, Karl Samuda, has ordered an investigation into an incident in which a teacher at the Pembroke Hall High School allegedly threatened a student with physical harm.<br/></b><br/>The incident was captured on video and has been widely circulated on social media. <br/><br/>Minister Samuda has reminded that teachers employed in the public education system that they are expected to act with professionalism and decorum while conducting classes, notwithstanding challenges dealing with difficult and/or uncooperative students.<br/><br/>“The behaviour displayed (at Pembroke Hall) is unnacceptable. It has no place in our schools,” said Minister Samuda.<br/>Teachers, he said, have a daily influence on the lives of children and are held to high standards. “In the midst of all of their responsibilities, they're required to serve as strong role models and demonstrate ethical behaviours as they interact with students, colleagues, parents and others, ” said Samuda.<br/><br/>He urged school administrators and governance bodies to remember to enable an environment that will promote appropriate behaviours for teachers, parents and students.  <br/><br/>“The ministry urges stakeholders' cooperation as we endeavour to ensure holistic education for every child,” said Samuda.</p>
