      <p>Operations Manager of Ekumfi Fruits and Juice factory, Fredrick Acquah, has urged all Ghanaians to patronize Eku juice under the government’s flagship project, One District One Factory, Ekumfi Fruits and Juice factory.</p>
      <p>The factory, which is said to be the biggest pineapple juice processing factory in West Africa, is expected to process about 300,000,000 packs of juice annually for the local and export markets.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Lawyer Ohene Gyan on ‘Pae Mu Ka’ on Accra based Kingdom FM 107.7, Fredrick Acquah noted: ” I’m urging all Ghanaians to patronize the products from the Ekumfi Fruits and Juice factory which will help in generating revenue and creating job opportunities for Ghanaian youth.”</p>
      <p>The facility will be the biggest pineapple juice processing factory in West Africa, with the capacity to process 10 tonnes of fruits per hour.</p>
      <p>The Ekumfi Pineapple Processing Factory is the first factory to be constructed under the government’s ‘One District One Factory’ initiative.</p>
      <p>However, he indicated that the factory can process about 300,000,000 packs of juice annually for the local and export markets and would generate close to GHS530 million in revenue.</p>
      <p>The factory is sited on a 50-acre land and has 100-metres length and 50metres width of factory floor space – large enough for additional production work.</p>
