      <h1>Notes from the 560: The great big dope</h1>

      <p><i>By Aditya Magal </i><br/><br/>A little around a year ago Prithvi Shaw was the hottest thing going on in Indian cricket. He had achieved the distinction of scoring a century on debut for the national side. What’s impressive is that he did this at the age of 18, becoming the second youngest Indian to score a century in international cricket. The youngest, as most people know, happens to be a former Rajya Sabha MP and Air Force Group Captain, who also played cricket off and on, named Sachin Tendulkar (wink!). <br/><br/>Shortly after his debut test series and debut century Prithvi Shaw got injured. He was a certain shoo-in for the test team to Australia but because of the injury had to give up that spot which has for now been seized by Bengalurean Mayank Agarwal. Despite the injury things were looking good for Shaw. He had been seized up as a marquee player for the Delhi IPL team ‘Delhi Capitals’ and received a pretty lucrative contract. His past is also illustrious because Shaw was the captain of the Under 19 national team. Under his captaincy and batsmanship, India won the U-19 World Cup and heralded a star cricketer for the future. <br/><br/>Things, however, changed for Shaw earlier this year when he tested positive for a banned substance. Prithvi quickly went from being a World Cup winning U-19 captain whose international career had gotten off to a great start to a potential ‘dope cheat’ literally overnight. Despite the BCCI’S efforts to fall outside the ambit of drug tests, the sports ministry decided to bring Indian cricket’s governing body under the scope of the National Anti-Doping Agency or NADA. Till Shaw’s case, the BCCI had successfully managed to stay out of the ambit of drug testing and drug controls for India’s cricketers. <br/><br/>Things are, however, better for Shaw who has just returned to playing domestic cricket after serving a six month ban. It’s a blessing that Shaw spent most of his time during the ban under the tutelage of Rahul Dravid and the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru. Dravid has made sure that the player doesn’t tip over to the wrong side and nurtured the potential of someone who can become a great player for India. It’s a great redemption story for Shaw and something the young cricketer must be grateful about. Shaw won’t be painted as the villain for now. The benefit of doubt has gone to him because it’s his first offence. Unlike serial cheats like Lance Armstrong and the Russian Olympic team, who have become notorious for taking doping to new heights. <br/><br/><br/>The BCCI has got a lot of explaining to do. They have managed this storm but it’s high time they get their house in order with regards to doping. Cricketers can’t be exempt from doping protocols. Athletes like Serena Williams and gymnast Simone Biles have taken banned substances after getting a ‘therapeutic use exemption’, a licence that allows them to take substances for medical conditions. It still puts them at an unfair advantage but the powers shield them from the backlash. <br/>| <br/>The BCCI on the other hand is itself not a very credible one. Its new chief Saurav Ganguly must make sure that it’s cricketers keep themselves clean and drug-free. His former vice-captain and Captain Rahul Dravid can’t always be the PR face to whitewash a doping disaster. <br/><br/><br/><b>Follow Aditya Magal on twitter @jhunjhunwala</b></p>
