      <p>The 49ers (6-5, 4-3 Conference USA) have won four straight conference games for their program-best sixth win.</p>

Chris Reynolds then led the 49ers on an 11-play, 62-yard drive capped by his 25-yard TD pass to Tucker with 48 seconds remaining.</p>
      <p>Tucker had five catches for 121 yards. Reynolds threw for 166 yards and two interceptions and added 145 yards on the ground, including a 15-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.</p>
