      <h1>Jurgen Klopp Provides Update on Mohamed Salah Injury Ahead of Crystal Palace Clash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/12955694" target="_blank">Ben Carter</a></address>
      <p>​Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah could be forced to have a spell on the sidelines to fully recover from an injury he aggravated against Manchester City, but manager Jürgen Klopp insists that the Egypt international won't need to undergo surgery.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has been playing through the pain at times this season, but he picked up another knock two weeks ago which saw Salah forced to drop out of international duty.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/mohamed-salah">Salah's</a> been training at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">Liverpool</a> over the last fortnight and Klopp insists the forward won't need to have surgery, but the club still haven't made a decision over whether to include him in this weekend's squad against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/palace">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>

      <p>"No, he doesn't need an operation," Klopp said, quoted by <a href="https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mohamed-salah-ankle-injury-crystal-palace-jurgen-klopp-1320509">inews</a>. "It is from the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">Leicester</a> game. It was getting better and better but it flared up again after the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">City</a> game again, another tackle.</p>
      <p>"It is not serious but in the short period we have to let it settle and it is always tight for the game. We will see. He trained completely yesterday, a full session, but we have to see how he reacted.</p>
      <p>"He has trained the whole time has been here during the international break but only the things we have wanted him to do. </p>
      <p>"It's not that it has got worse, but it's still kind of there. It's still there, that's the problem. We have to be sensible with things like this. We have to make a decision."</p>
      <p>Klopp also voiced his concerns about Salah's potential rest at the end of the season after Egypt qualified for next summer's Olympics.</p>

      <p>The Liverpool star has already spent the last two summers without a break, but he could be forced into another shorter pre-season if Salah's selected to represent The Pharaohs in Japan next summer.</p>
      <p>"There are some problems I know in the future, this I know from an hour ago that Egypt have qualified for the Olympics," he added.</p>
      <p>"I have to speak to Mo. I don’t know if I do it today, or whenever. Who said they want him? Do they have a manager who said it? Do we know if we have to [send]? I do not know that."</p>
