        <b>Two days after he suggested Granit Xhaka was close to returning, Unai Emery again left the midfielder out of his matchday squad.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Granit Xhaka's</b> absence from Arsenal's first-team squad continued as he was <b>once again omitted</b> for Saturday's home Premier League game against Southampton.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for the club since October 27, when his furious reaction to being <b>jeered by fans </b>following his substitution against Crystal Palace led to him being stripped of the club captaincy.</p>
      <p>Having previously cast doubt over whether the Switzerland midfielder <b>would play for Arsenal again, head coach Unai Emery suggested Xhaka was back in contention for a recall on Thursday.</b></p>

      <p><b>However, Emery has ultimately opted</b> to delay the 27-year-old's comeback.</p>
      <p>There was no place for Xhaka in Arsenal's 18-man squad to face Southampton, while the starting line-up sho<b>wed two changes from a 2-0 defeat to Leicester City</b> last time out, with Sokratis Papastathopoulos and <b>Kieran Tierney</b> returning.</p>
      <p>Arsenal went into the game <b>winless in four Premier League matches</b> since a 1-0 home victory over Bournemouth on October 6.</p>
