      <h1>Marcus Rashford Insists Ole Gunnar Solskjaer Is Right Man for the Manchester United Job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15203443" target="_blank">Adam Aladay</a></address>
      <p>​Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has stated that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the right man to carry the club forward, while further claiming that a top four finish is not enough this season.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils had made their worst start to a season for 33 years, finding themselves hovering above the relegation spaces. However, results have begun to improve in recent weeks and the team have won two of their previous three league clashes, losing once in their last seven in all competitions.</p>

      <p>Despite this uptick in form, rumours have begun to resurface regarding a move for ex-Tottenham Hotspur boss Mauricio Pochettino, after he was relieved of his duties on Tuesday. Following the sacking of the now Spurs boss Jose Mourinho back in December, Pochettino was <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6268749-solskjaer-pochettino-go-head-to-head-in-audition-to-become-next-man-utd-manager">​heavily linked</a> with the role, with <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501725-how-mauricio-pochettino-reacted-to-tottenham-sacking-his-thoughts-on-the-man-utd-job">​<i>90min</i> learning</a> that the Argentine was 'gutted' he was overlooked.</p>
      <p>However, Rashford has now reiterated once more that Solskjaer is the best person for the job. The 22-year-old told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/11866087/marcus-rashford-backs-ole-gunnar-solskjaer-no-one-better-for-manchester-united">​Sky Sports News</a>: "There was no hesitation from me over <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6402262-marcus-rashford-signs-new-four-year-contract-with-manchester-united">​signing a new contract</a>. And it was the same for Ole as well - I could see where his head was at, where he wanted the club to be at and for me it was just a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>"We were on the same page and wanted the same things for the club. Ole is a great guy and he has the club's interests at heart so there's not a better person for the job in my opinion."</p>

      <p>The Englishman went on to further mention that the club must chase trophies this season, stating that a top four finish will not be considered a successful season in his eyes. </p>
      <p>He continued: "I think it's been 18 months [actually two-and-a-half years] since we won our last trophy so it's been a while. If we come out of this season with top four but without a trophy, I wouldn't be happy.</p>
      <p>"For me it is just about putting markers down for what we can do in the future because we know that this period is not going to change overnight, Ole's not going to get what he wants overnight."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/marcus-rashford">​Rashford</a> has been in impressive form in recent weeks, having scored nine times in his last ten matches for club and country. While rumours will continue to swirl regarding Pochettino's next destination, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">​United</a>'s number ten has been quick to back his manager. </p>
