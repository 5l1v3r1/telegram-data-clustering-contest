      <p>LAHORE: Chief Justice Asif Saeed Khan Khosa said on Saturday that if the rulers did their jobs right then the courts won't feel the need to interfere. </p>
      <p>The chief justice was addressing a ceremony after chairing a meeting on police reforms. </p>
      <p>"Whenever a matter captures the public's attention, people expect a suo motu notice," he said. "If the government institution is active beforehand then the court does not need to take a notice on it."</p>
      <p>He said that approaching the Supreme Court should be the final resort for people seeking justice, stressing that the dispensation of justice must take place much earlier in the legal system.  </p>
      <p>The chief justice said that he didn't think it was appropriate for senior officials to present themselves time and again in front of the courts.</p>
      <p>"One should maintain the dignity of a police official or any other person who appears before the court," he said.</p>
      <p>The chief justice said that if the Supreme Court starts interfering in matters of the government from day one then it creates difficulties.</p>
      <p>He said that for justice to be dispensed to the masses expeditiously, it was necessary for police to conduct their investigations efficiently. </p>
      <p>"My first task as chief justice was to protect the dignity of those who seek justice from the courts," he said. </p>
      <p>He praised the courts for wrapping up cases and providing people with "swift justice" in a short span of time. </p>
      <p>"Model courts wrapped up 24,000 cases related to drugs," he said. "Magistrate cases announced decisions in 27,469 cases."</p>
      <p>Justice Khosa said that concrete steps had been taken to counter false testimonies. He said that the investigating officer will also be treated like a suspect in a case of false testimony. </p>
      <p>"From now on, the investigation officer will be held responsible for his investigation," he said. "It's not possible that the investigation officer does not know the truth."</p>
      <p>He urged judges and the courts to do their part as well in ensuring that cases of perjury are identified. </p>
      <p>Justice Khosa also said that it was not the job of the investigation officer to prove everything that the complainant says. </p>
