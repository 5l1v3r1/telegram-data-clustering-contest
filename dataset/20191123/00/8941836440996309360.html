      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Minnesota Democrats say the decision by the Republican leader in the state House of Representatives to join a Washington D.C.-area government relations firm as its director of public affairs is a conflict of interest.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-star/">The Star</a> Tribune reports that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stateside-associates/">Stateside Associates</a> of Arlington, Virginia announced the hiring of Rep. Kurt Daudt on Friday. The Republican from Crown will continue to serve in the state Legislature and as GOP caucus leader.</p>
      <p>Minnesota DFL Chairman Ken Martin called on Daudt to resign from one of the roles, arguing that he is “opening himself up to massive conflicts of interest by working for a lobbying firm” while serving in the Legislature.</p>
      <p>Daudt told the newspaper he will not be lobbying or working on any Minnesota issues in his new job.</p>
