      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - Charles Williams scored from the 1 in the final 1:15 and Kolo Uasike picked off a last-gasp pass as UNLV came out on top of a wild fourth quarter with a 38-35 defeat of San Jose State in the last game at Sam Boyd Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>UNLV (3-8, 1-6 Mountain West) built a 21-6 lead only to swap the lead four times in the final 15 minutes before coming out on top at the end of 49 years at Sam Boyd.</p>
      <p>Williams, who entered the game as the Mountain West’s leading rusher - and ranked 29th in the nation - with 933 yards, gained 186 more against San Jose State with three touchdowns. He scored twice in the fourth quarter, including the game-winner with 1:15 remaining to cap a nine-play drive.</p>
      <p>The Spartans (4-7, 1-6) zoomed into the red zone on the ensuing possession with an 80-yard first-down completion from Josh Love to Isaiah Hamilton, advancing to the UNLV 12. San Jose State had a third-and-goal at the 5 with six seconds left to play, but Love’s pass was tipped at the line of scrimmage and intercepted by Uasike.</p>
