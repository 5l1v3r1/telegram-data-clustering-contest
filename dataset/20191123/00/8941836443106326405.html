      <p>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) - Authorities say a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/spokane-police/">Spokane Police</a> officer has been arrested and accused of raping a female victim of a crime he was investigating.</p>
      <p>The Spokane County Sheriff’s Office says 36-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nathan-nash/">Nathan Nash</a> was arrested Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office says in October detectives opened an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nathan-nash/">Nash</a> after the female spoke to authorities.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office says Spokane Police Department officials requested the investigation after her complaint.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nathan-nash/">Nash</a> has been booked into the Spokane County Jail on suspicion of second-degree rape and two counts of official misconduct.</p>
