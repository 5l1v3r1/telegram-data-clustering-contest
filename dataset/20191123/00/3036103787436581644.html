      <h1>What the Samsung Galaxy S11 could look like</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Samsung’s next flagship smartphone could boast a rectangular penta-camera setup and a 120Hz display, according to a <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s11-render-design-exclusive"><b>report from 91Mobiles</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The site collaborated with tech leaker Steve H. McFly, also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1197833371516329985"><b>OnLeaks</b></a>, who compiled the various rumours about the Samsung Galaxy S11 to create a concept design.</p>
      <p>OnLeaks has previously created accurate early renders of the Galaxy Note 10, iPhone 11, Pixel 4 XL, and other devices.</p>
      <h3>Design changes</h3>
      <p>According to the images, the front camera’s hole punch is now located at the centre-top of the screen, rather than on the right.</p>
      <p>The bezels at the top and bottom of the phone are thinner than on the Galaxy S10, while the side bezels remain roughly the same.</p>
      <p>The most noteworthy feature, however, is the rectangular rear camera array of five sensors.</p>
      <p>This includes the <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/smartphones/327055-samsung-galaxy-s11-will-have-a-108mp-camera-and-massive-screen-report.html"><b>rumoured 108MP camera</b></a>, which has already been seen in the Xiaomi Mi MIX Alpha.</p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>The S11 is expected to boast a top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, with 8GB RAM and 256GB internal storage.</p>
      <p>A previous <b><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-will-probably-have-a-120hz-display/">report </a></b>claimed the screen will also sport a 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
      <p>If Samsung sticks to its regular release schedule, the Galaxy S11 will be unveiled in February 2020.</p>
      <p>The renders below are taken from 91Mobiles.</p>
