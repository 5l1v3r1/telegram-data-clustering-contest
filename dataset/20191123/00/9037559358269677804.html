      <p>LONDON: Former chief minister Punjab and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz President Shehbaz Sharif has said that Prime Minister Imran Khan has made irresponsible and mean statements about the health of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, discrediting doctors appointed by his own government and from his own Shaukat Khanum hospital.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the prime minister took a sly dig at Nawaz, saying that the ailing former premier suddenly recovered and looked perfectly fine as he got a glimpseof the London-bound air ambulance. Shehbaz said that he didn’t want to talk about Pakistani politics as he was in London for his brother’s health-related issues but he said: “In the last fewdays, he (Imran Khan) has said things which don’t suit him.”</p>
      <p>Shehbaz said that PTI govt appointed its own independent doctors to check Nawaz Sharif’s health. He said Imran Khan asked Shaukat Khanum Hospital doctors to independently verify medical reports of Nawaz and was told that the former prime minister was in highly critical condition and treatment for him was not available in Pakistan. Shehbaz Sharif took Nawaz to the University College Hospital, Westmoreland Street (The Heart Hospital) on Saturday for his check-up.</p>
      <p>Hesaid: “Dr Lawrence checked Nawaz Sharif related to his cardiac issues. Thedoctor has recommended few tests for him. For his other episodes, he has seen doctors at the Guy’s Hospital and further tests and checks have been recommended. We request for prayers for Nawaz Sharif.”</p>
      <p>NawazSharif’s personal physician Dr Adnan Khan said that he had a cardiac consultation &amp; evaluation by Dr. David Lawrence, a Cardiothoracic Surgeon, at University College Hospital.</p>
      <p>“Mr.Sharif is given a roadmap for cardiac investigations &amp; subsequent treatment,”he said. Dr.Lawrence performed CABG (Heart Bypass Surgery) on Nawaz in May 2016 and has clinically looked after him ever since. He added: “Dr. Lawrence is in sync with Haematologists at Guy’s &amp; St. Thomas’Hospital will manage Mr. Sharif.”</p>
      <p>On Friday, Shehbaz Sharif said that Nawaz had gone through the process of cardiac intervention seven times.</p>
      <p>"Hewas monitored by a doctor from Switzerland," said Shehbaz. Nawaz's personal physician Dr Adnan said that arteries carrying blood to Nawaz's brain were 80 percent blocked.</p>
      <p>"Nawaz's medical appointments are booked," he said. "If the need arises, he will be taken to the hospital.The government removed Nawaz's name from the ECL after a verdict from the Lahore High Court allowed the former prime minister to go abroad without the government's conditions. However, the court included an undertaking from both Nawaz and Shehbaz which said that he would return to Pakistan after he recovered.</p>
