      <p>BOSTON (AP) - Legislation awaiting Gov. Charlie Baker’s signature would provide $1.5 billion in new spending on the state’s K-12 education system.</p>
      <p>The bill was approved by the Massachusetts House and Senate this week and sent on to the Republican governor.</p>
      <p>Supporters of the bill say it would make sure public schools have the resources to provide high quality education for students across the state, regardless of zip code or income level.</p>
      <p>Legislative leaders say the bill unveiled Thursday would help schools that serve high percentages of low-income students while benefiting districts across the state with updates to the existing - and contentious - school funding formula.</p>
      <p>The proposal would also increase spending on other school programs such as special education transportation and school construction.</p>
