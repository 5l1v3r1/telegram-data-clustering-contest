      <p>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - San Jose police have arrested a man they say had improvised explosive devices at his home and they’re investigating whether he’s connected to a bomb found at a nearby school.</p>
      <p>Police say Andrew White was taken into custody at around 2:30 a.m. Friday after an eight-hour standoff. Authorities say they found several devices at his home, prompting the evacuation of neighbors.</p>
      <p>White was arrested on a drug warrant and for resisting arrest. It’s not immediately clear whether he has an attorney.</p>
      <p>Investigators haven’t determined whether White is connected to a homemade bomb discovered Tuesday morning near a student parking lot at Oak Grove High School.</p>
      <p>Nobody was hurt but the school was closed for a day.</p>
