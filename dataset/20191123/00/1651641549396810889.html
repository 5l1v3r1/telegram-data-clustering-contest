      <p>Apple is reportedly bumping up the RAM in its next-gen iPhones from the current 4GB to a more healthy 6GB, as per reports originating from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/22/barclays-iphone-12-pro-likely-6gb-ram/">Macrumors</a>. Citing a Barclays analyst, the iPhone 12 is also said to feature 5G, a technology that would become more mainstream as more and more flagship manufacturers adopt it.</p>
      <p>While 6GB of RAM has become table stakes in the very spec hungry Android world, the iPhone remains famous for doing more with less.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 12 is also expected<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-wants-to-make-ios-14-less-buggy/"> to ship with iOS 14,</a> an update that will be partially focused on stability much like iOS 12. While Apple still intends to make it as feature-packed as the <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-releases-ios-13-public-beta-with-dark-mode-advanced-photo-and-camera-features-and-more/">current iOS 13 release,</a> some features may slip to iOS 15 should they affect system stability.</p>
      <p>Aside from the iPhone 12, Barclays analysts also shared information of the iPhone SE2. This handset is expected to be introduced around March, featuring the shell of the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 but with the newer A13 chip and 3GB of RAM.</p>
