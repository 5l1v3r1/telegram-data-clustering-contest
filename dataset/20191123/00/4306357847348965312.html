      <h1>‘I expect a reaction’: Sky Sports pundit predicts West Ham v Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Charlie Nicholas looks ahead to Tottenham's trip to West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday</h2>

      <h3>Charlie Nicholas is tipping Tottenham Hotspur to claim a 2-1 win over West Ham United in Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge on Saturday lunchtime.</h3>
      <p>The Lilywhites head into the game looking to claim their first three points under their new manager after Mourinho was brought in as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor last week.</p>
      <p>Spurs opted to part company with Pochettino on Tuesday night and wasted no time in appointing former Chelsea FC and Manchester United boss Mourinho as his successor.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will now be keen for his side to start off his reign with a victory against their London rivals at the London Stadium in Stratford on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>And former Arsenal star Nicholas is tipping the Lilywhites to claim all three points with a narrow 2-1 victory away to West Ham.</p>
      <p>Writing in his column for <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12090/11866441/charlie-nicholas-premier-league-predictions">Sky Sports</a>, Nicholas said: “Normally you get a bounce with a new manager, but I don’t know what a bounce is for Tottenham. West Ham love to turn Tottenham over more than any of the London clubs and there is something about the hostility between the two of these sides.</p>
      <p>“Manuel Pellegrini is under serious pressure and could be sacked with a heavy defeat.</p>
      <p>“One manager is trying to save himself, while the other manager – Jose Mourinho – is trying to assert his authority on a side that has had an abysmal season thus far. He won’t have any time to do it going into the weekend so they will have to batten down the hatches and get on with it.</p>
      <p>“It will be interesting to see who Mourinho picks. There are a lot of people who will be feeling down that Mauricio Pochettino has gone, but I expect a reaction from Tottenham. There will be fire in the belly and it will be feisty.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho takes charge of Tottenham with the Lilywhites down in 14th place in the Premier League table, with Spurs having only won three of their opening 12 games in the top flight.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach’s new side will then switch their attentions to Champions League affairs on Tuesday night with a home clash against Olympiakos.</p>
