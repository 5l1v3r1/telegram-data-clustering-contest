      <p>Sacked Dr Baffour Awuah whose appointment as the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service(GHS) was withdrawn only two weeks after it was announced is set to be re-appointed, MyNewsGH.com reports.</p>
      <p>The disclosure about his possible reappointment to a different and much higher position was made Chairman of the ruling NPP in the Ashanti region, Bernard Antwi Boasiako a.k.a Chairman Wontumi.</p>
      <p>Wontumi asked the embattled Dr. Baffour Awuah to wait for an opportune time for a bigger appointment.</p>
      <p>It is unclear what must have caused the presidency to make the sudden u-turn but Wontumi argues that this is not the first time an appointment into public office has been withdrawn by a president.</p>
      <p>He says the President has the prerogative to hire and fire, so Dr Baffour Awuah must accept his disappointment in good faith and hope for an even better position.</p>
