        <b>Lyon edged past Nice 2-1 at the Groupama Stadium on Saturday despite playing 56 minutes with 10 men as coach Rudi Garcia claimed his third win in four league games to shoot up the table.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The home side, who lost to Garcia's former club Marseille before the international break, <b>moved up to fifth in the congested Ligue 1 table</b> having started the day 14th.</p>
      <p>Jeff Reine-Adelaide gave Lyon a 10th-minute lead with a low finish from the edge of the area, before Moussa Dembele slotted in his <b>10th league goal of the season </b>from the penalty spot after being hacked down himself by Nice centre-back Christophe Herelle.</p>
      <p>But Lyon's march to victory was dealt a blow in the 34th minute as full-back Fernando Marcal was <b>sent off for a dreadful high challenge</b> on Nice youngster Hichem Boudaoui.</p>
