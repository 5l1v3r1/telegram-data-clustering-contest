      <h1>Luka Doncic: ‘I Knew I Was Going to Be Good, But Not That Good’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/mutoni/" target="_blank">Marcel Mutoni</a></address>
      <p>Even <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/luka-doncic">Luka Doncic</a> didn’t expect to be this good, this soon.</p>
      <p>With <a href="http://www.slamonline.com/tag/dirk-nowitzki">Dirk Nowitzki</a> watching from his courtside perch, Doncic finished with 30 points and 14 assists in the Mavs’ 143-101 laugher against the visiting Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>

      <p>The 20-year-old is putting up historic numbers coming off an NBA Rookie of the Year campaign, and became the first Dallas player to score at least 30 points in three straight games since Nowitzki in 2010.</p>
      <p>Per <i><a href="https://apnews.com/ef87143a5b7543dbaba95d22f65ebe55">The AP</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“I’m here to make this franchise, make this team a better team,” said [Kristaps] Porzingis, who also had four blocks in his 200th career game. “I’m trying to do my part. I’m sure Luka’s trying to do his part. He’s doing it well.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“As I said before, those are some huge shoes that we have to fill with Dirk ending his career and how high he set the standard for this organization.”<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>Dallas (10-5) moved five games above .500 for the first time since late in the 2015-16 season, which ended up being Nowitzki’s final trip to the playoffs after leading the franchise to its only championship in 2011.<br/></i>
        <br/>
        <i>“They can really shoot,” [Cavs] coach John Beilein said. “The couple of shots that Porzingis made and Luka made, you can’t defend them. They’re stepping back, they’ve got great size and they’re shooting it in from 30 feet. Really a talented team.”</i>
