      <p>Otago Polytechnic product design students have been working with long-established Dunedin firm Otago Furniture to develop furniture for a diverse range of purposes.</p>
      <p>The results were now on display as part of the polytechnic's end-of-year Student Showcase which is being held in The Hub until tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Students in the programme gained a deep understanding of what was involved in identifying new product opportunities within a company, product design lecturer Tim Armstrong said.</p>
      <p>"The students develop concepts to address these opportunities, and communicate their process clearly and professionally to their client.</p>
      <p>"They learn about what it takes to develop and manufacture products in New Zealand, and the opportunities and considerations this presents. They design and prototype compelling products within these boundaries.</p>
      <p>"They also keep a record of the time spent in each phase, considering hourly work rates, invoicing and other elements of professional practice," he said.</p>
      <p>Second-year student Toni Linington's starting point was to research chair design in relation to the needs of older people and those undergoing rehabilitation due to injury, illness or disability.</p>
      <p>She focused on an individual leg support that could be adjusted to raise the leg to different heights, providing comfort and supporting pressure areas to avoid further injury.</p>
      <p>Other designs included a chair with the specific intent of encouraging elderly people to spend more time outside, a bassinet and co-sleeper for newborn babies, an ottoman to be used by primary school children, and an ottoman chair inspired by Pasifika culture.</p>
      <p>Otago Furniture manager Juliet Dow was impressed by the students' designs, saying a lot of thought and research had gone into them. They were diverse and it was good to see cultural inspiration, she said.</p>
