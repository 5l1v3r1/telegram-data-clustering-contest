      <h1>Journey of a donor: How a donated organ finds its way to its new home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:08:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:08</time> by <a rel="author">Shawn Logan</a></address>
      <p>A critical window opens for only a short period of time when a family makes the life-changing decision to allow a dying loved one to become an organ and tissue donor.</p>
      <p>The window can only open during two types of deaths, which allow for doctors to harvest vital organs and tissue that can be used to save or improve the lives of others. The first death is one in which the brain stops functioning (neurological death), but other vital functions remain operative. The second is cardio-circulatory death, in which life is not sustainable without a ventilator.</p>
      <p>Dr. Andreas Kramer, medical director of the Southern Alberta Organ and Tissue Donation Program in Calgary, said once medical staff in an intensive care unit receive consent from family members following these diagnoses, a Canada-wide network gets to work to connect patients in greatest need with any viable organs or tissue that can potentially be transplanted.</p>
      <p>“There is lots of organ sharing that occurs across provincial borders in Canada, in order to ensure that the person in greatest need is the one that gets the organ next,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Most of this kind of organization and administration of where the organ goes, that all happens while the organ donor in an intensive care unit on life support,” Kramer said. “It occurs between the time of consent that’s obtained from the family and the donor going to the operating room to have the organs removed.”</p>
      <p>That window is usually 24 to 36 hours, Kramer said, but can extend to as much as 48 to 72 hours in some cases.</p>
      <p>Depending on the health of the donor and the type of death, as many as eight organs can be transplanted: two lungs, two kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas and intestines.</p>
      <p>When it comes to tissue, which must be removed within 12 to 24 hours after death, the potentially life-changing gifts include corneas, heart valves, skin, bone, tendons and amniotic tissue, which can benefit as many as 75 people.</p>
      <p>Kramer said once a family agrees to organ donation, medical personnel do everything they can to ensure viability of the organs to give them the best chance for successful transplantation.</p>

      <p>“While we’re caring for an organ donor on life support, we’re trying to optimize the organ function as much as possible,” he said. “And then, there’s some very careful decision making made around whether the organ can actually be transplanted or not.”</p>
      <p>Every harvested organ is on the clock once it’s removed, so time is of the essence in ensuring the recipient is ready for transplant as soon as possible. Hearts and intestines need to be transplanted within four to six hours while kidneys can remain viable for up to 12 to 24 hours after removal.</p>
      <p>In 2018, some 532 viable organs were procured from patients with a neurological death, with another 230 obtained via cardio-respiratory death. In Alberta, those numbers were 50 and 21, respectively.</p>
      <p>Once a patient has an organ successfully transplanted, the work isn’t over.</p>
      <p>Anti-rejection medication is critical for those who’ve had a transplant to ensure the body’s built-in protection mechanisms don’t attack the new organ. And they can expect years of follow-up with doctors to monitor both the organ’s and the patient’s health.</p>
      <p>In terms of extending the life of organ recipients, in most cases between 80 to 90 per cent of patients survive at least five years; lung transplants see seven out of 10 reach the five-year mark, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.</p>
      <p>For kidney recipients, both suitability and longevity of the organ are significantly increased if the kidney came from a living donor.</p>
      <p>When it comes to living donors, kidneys account for the vast majority of such procedures, although living liver transplants also occur. (There have also been rare instances of living lung donations.)</p>

      <p>Dr. Mauricio Monroy-Cuadros, a transplant surgeon and medical director of Calgary’s living donor program, said kidney patients represent about eight in 10 of those needing organ transplants in Canada, and traditionally some are lucky enough to have a friend or acquaintance who’s a match for them and is willing to spare a kidney.</p>
      <p>However, more and more people are coming forward who have no relation to the patient, which importantly boosts the potential to save lives.</p>
      <p>“Usually, there is somebody in the family — or a friend or relative — that is willing to donate a kidney, and then you get a transplant from that person,” Monroy-Cuadros said.</p>
      <p>“And there is a second way within the living donors, which is a person we call an altruistic donor or non-direct donor. They come forward to the program and say, ‘I consider myself healthy and blessed because I have two functional kidneys and I want to help somebody.’”</p>
      <p>Of the 38 to 45 kidney transplants Monroy-Cuadros performs annually, about 10 to 15 represent these altruistic donors — strangers who want to help someone in need with a life-giving gift.</p>
      <p>Before someone can become a living donor, candidates undergo a battery of tests including physical, medical and mental health assessments.</p>
      <p>“Normally, any living donor that wants to be considered a donor has to go through a process. This process involves a medical, surgical and psycho-social assessment, and in order for you to be accepted as a donor, you have to be approved in those three aspects,” Monroy-Cuadros said. “Those evaluations are being done separately and they’re independent. So, you may be accepted in two of those assessments, but you fail one and then you’ll be declined.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He said about half of altruistic donors will actually make it through the testing and be approved to continue in the process.</p>
      <p>Once a prospective donor is given the green light, it’s simply a matter of scheduling a date for surgery.</p>
      <p>On the day of the surgery, both the donor and recipient are placed in nearby operating suites. The operation to remove the kidney itself generally takes four to five hours and it will be transplanted into the patient within 15 to 30 minutes, Monroy-Cuadros said. The success rate of the surgery, in normal conditions, is around 99 per cent.</p>
      <p>As soon as the kidney starts working, it can quickly transform the life of the recipient. Many of the recipients will have previously spent years undergoing gruelling dialysis treatments several times a week, while enduring strict diets, so the transplant can have a significant impact on their quality of life.</p>
      <p>“The goal is that these patients resume a normal life after they get transplanted. And that’s the beauty of transplantation, because it allows us to place patients back to normal life,” Monroy-Cuadros said.</p>
      <p>“Many of them go back to work, whatever they did before their illness. It’s hard to predict, but usually after six months to a year they get back to where they were before they needed a transplant.”</p>
