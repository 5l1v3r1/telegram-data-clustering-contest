      <h1>Real Madrid vs Real Sociedad: 8 Key Facts &amp; Stats to Impress Your Mates Ahead of La Liga Clash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15402033" target="_blank">Charlie Adey</a></address>
      <p>​Real Madrid host Real Sociedad at the Santiago Bernabéu on Saturday evening as Zinedine Zidane's side look to leapfrog Barcelona at the top of the La Liga table.</p>
      <p>Los Blancos have enjoyed a fruitful start to the 2019/20 campaign, losing only one of their opening 12 games, leaving them with 25 points – starting the weekend behind Barcelona on goal difference alone.</p>
      <p>Real Sociedad have also kicked off the league campaign in style, with players such as Mikel Oyarzabal and Martin Ødegaard especially prevalent with six goals between them. </p>
      <p>This should be a tightly contested game that will be difficult to predict, however <i>you</i> can show off your footballing expertise to your mates by using these eight stats ahead of this fixture, courtesy of Opta. </p>

      <h3>Real Winners</h3>

      <p>Real are really good at winning this season and, if history is anything to go by, los Blancos should collect three points against their Basque opponents.</p>
      <p>No side has beaten Real Sociedad on more occasions in <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/la-liga">​La Liga</a> history than Real Madrid (81, along with Barça). Indeed, the Basques have conceded the most goals against the Whites in the competition (313).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Estadio Santiago Bernabéu isn't the easiest place to win, especially if you're La Real.</p>
      <p>Real Sociedad have only won one of their last 12 La Liga visits to the Santiago Bernabéu (D1 L10), their last such trip in January 2019 (2-0). Gulp. </p>

      <h3>3 Is A Magic Number</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Having said that, the White and Blues have enjoyed a rare successful spell against Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Real Sociedad have won their last two league matches against Real Madrid - only once have they won three consecutive games against the Whites in the top flight (between 2003 and 2004, under Raynald Denoueix).</p>
      <p>Can they make it three for only the second time in their history?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Despite the goalscoring form of Willian José (5), Mikel Oyarzabal (5) and Portu (5), Sociedad will have a tough time breaking the defensive barriers at the Bernabéu on Saturday. </p>
      <p>Real Madrid have kept clean sheets in their last five games in all competitions (W4 D1) and they are looking to do so in six consecutive games for the first time since January 2014, under Carlo Ancelotti (8).</p>

      <h3>Fast Starters</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>​Real Madrid have scored 56% of their goals in the first half of La Liga games this season, the highest percentage in the division, whilst they have also conceded the lowest percentage of goals in the first half (22%).</p>
      <p>If only <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​los Merengues</a> could replicate their first half form in the second half, ey?</p>

      <h3>Fox In the Box</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.minutemediacdn.com/process?url=https%3A%2F%2F90min-images-original.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fproduction%2Frcd-espanyol-v-real-sociedad-la-liga-5dd9092f8317e2d9d600001d.jpg&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bw%5D=0.8888888888888888&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bh%5D=1.0&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_x%5D=0.08571428571428572&amp;filters%5Bcrop%5D%5Bo_y%5D=0.0&amp;filters%5Bquality%5D%5Btarget%5D=80&amp;type=.jpg&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bw%5D=630&amp;filters%5Bresize%5D%5Bh%5D=472"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Javier Hernandez, Domino's pizza and Real Sociedad - all great in the box. </p>
      <p>Real Sociedad are one of the two La Liga sides to have scored 100% of their goals from inside the box this season (21 - along with Atlético de Madrid, 15), while Real Madrid are the only side to have conceded 100% of their goals from inside the box (9).</p>
      <p>However, if they stand any chance of creeping into Spain's top four, Real Sociedad will have to start thinking outside of the box. </p>

      <h3>Better Call Benz</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Karim Benzema continues to be omitted from the France squad, but it is a real shame, as the 31-year-old is enjoying a prolific spell in his career.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid's Karim Benzema is the top scorer in La Liga this season (9). Indeed, only Barcelona's Lionel Messi (29) has scored more goals than the Frenchman in the competition in 2019 (24).</p>

      <h3>Super Mikel</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Xabi Alonso, Antoine Griezmann and Carlos Vela are all Real Sociedad greats​, and it seems they have another star on their hands. </p>
      <p>Mikel Oyarzabal has been directly involved in more La Liga goals than any other Real Sociedad player this season (eight, four goals and four assists).</p>
