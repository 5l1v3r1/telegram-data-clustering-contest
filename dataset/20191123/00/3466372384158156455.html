      <p>Talking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut also said the state will never forgive Ajit Pawar for this act of his.</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar has stabbed the Shiv Sena in the back. Joining hands with the BJP to form the government is betrayal," he said.</p>
      <p>"Ajit Pawar's decision does not have the approval of NCP chief Sharad Pawar," Raut said.</p>
      <p>He added that Sharad Pawar and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will address a joint press conference soon.</p>
