      <p>SALEM, Ore. — The Latest on a planned liquefied natural gas pipeline and marine export terminal in Oregon (all times local):</p>
      <p>4:51 p.m.</p>
      <p>A federal agency has issued a final environmental impact statement on a controversial proposal to build a liquefied natural gas pipeline and marine terminal in Oregon, and it concluded that there would be no significant impact on the state’s waters, wildlife and minimal risk of a pipeline accident.</p>
      <p>The lengthy report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was publicized Friday, a day after protesters flooded into the Oregon state capitol and staged a sit-in at the governor’s office before police arrested 21 of them for trespassing. The protesters, who demanded that Oregon Gov. Kate Brown take a public stand against the pipeline, were jailed overnight and released early Friday.</p>

      <p>Authorities have reportedly released 21 protesters who were arrested Thursday night during a sit-in at the governor’s office in the Oregon state capitol.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators are opposed to a planned liquefied natural gas pipeline and a marine export terminal in Oregon. They demanded that Gov. Kate Brown publicly oppose the project, which she refused to do.</p>
      <p>Southern Oregon Rising Tide, which organized the protest, said the 21 arrested by Oregon State Police spent the night in jail and were out by 5 a.m. Friday. The police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The proposed marine terminal, in Coos Bay, would allow export of American liquid natural gas to Asia, and would have a 230-mile (370-kilometre) feeder pipeline from an interstate gas hub in southern Oregon’s Klamath County.</p>
