      <p>Former <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/epl-arsenal-chiefs-meet-staff-over-unai-emerys-future/"><u><b>Arsenal</b> </u></a>attacker, Robert Pires, has called on manager Unai Emery to sign intelligent English players to help the team.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that Arsenal are eight points off Champions League places after 12 fixtures, with only four wins on their record to date,</p>
      <p>Emery has seen his position linked with various managers as the Gunners continue to falter in the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/11/arsenals-aubameyang-named-premier-league-best-player/"><u><b>English Premier League (EPL)</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>The Gunners manager has come under criticism over his tactics and selection policy, notably his decision to play Lucas Torreira in a more advanced position.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Athletic, Pires said: <i>“The team needs so many ingredients in the squad. Physical, technical, some players with intelligence. Of course, we need leadership – and we need English players.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“We need English players because we are in England and nobody else has grown up with this mentality.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“You need to be born here. It’s very nice when you get to discover new countries but for me when you play in England you need English players.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s a different time. But I used to play with David Seaman, Lee Dixon, Tony Adams, Martin Keown, Ashley Cole, Ray Parlour… We’re talking about six English players in the team. We need similar players.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Of course I respect the Arsenal philosophy but we are in the Premier League and it’s so tough every weekend.”</i>
