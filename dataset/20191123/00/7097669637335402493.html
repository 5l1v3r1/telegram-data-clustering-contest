      <p>Mitar Checkpoint (Israel) (AFP) - It is well before dawn when the first work deprived Palestinians arrive to sneak through a two-metre hole cut in the metal fence that is supposed to keep them out of Israel.</p>
      <p>The men are among the thousands of Palestinians working in Israel illegally, risking bad working conditions, exploitation and jail for a chance of employment.</p>
      <p>On the morning AFP visited, Yunis, from Dahariya in the southern West Bank, was one of hundreds running the gauntlet as police patrolled the area.</p>
      <p>They play a cat and mouse game with Israeli security -â€“ sometimes making several attempts before crossing without being spotted.</p>
      <p>"I got here at 3:00 am and found police patrols ahead of us," said the bearded and wrinkled 55-year-old.</p>
      <p>"I know I am leaving my house and I may not come back but this bitter life drives us to adventure."</p>
      <p>Around a kilometre or so away, Palestinians lucky enough to have permits queue in a long line at the Mitar crossing between Beersheba in southern Israel and the West Bank, waiting for their documents to be checked and their bags and bodies to be searched.</p>
      <p>Visibly tired, they wear winter jackets and carry small bags containing food and work clothes.</p>
      <p>Around 70,000 Palestinians have official work permits, according to the Bank of Israel.</p>
      <p>While reliable numbers are hard to come by, thousands more are estimated to be working illegally in the country -- mostly in construction and other manual labour.</p>
      <p>They can earn far higher salaries than in the West Bank, but can be arrested or exploited by employers.</p>
      <p>- 'Just want dignity' -</p>
      <p>Amir, 20, who like others didn't want to give his full name, comes from the town of Yatta near Hebron in the southern West Bank.</p>
      <p>He sneaks through the separation barrier to make money to help his family.</p>
      <p>"The police arrested me four times," said Amir, alleging that he was held for several hours and beaten.</p>
      <p>He also said that he and his peers had been chased by police dogs.</p>
      <p>Asked by AFP, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld described allegations of beatings as "incorrect" and "misleading".</p>
      <p>"All border police activities take place according to strict orders and a strict protocol", with illegal workers returned to Palestinian areas, and serial offenders liable to prison sentences or fines, he said.</p>
      <p>Even if he avoids the police at the fence and finds work, Amir has to be careful, knowing he could still be arrested on the street.</p>
      <p>"We worked for months on the site without washing," he said. "We just want to live with dignity."</p>
      <p>On the Israeli side of the crossing, taxis line up to ferry the men to nearby cities -- both those with permits and those without.</p>
      <p>Tayseer, 38, had snuck across and avoided police searches by mingling successfully with those who had permits.</p>
      <p>"We make 130 shekels (less than $40, 35 euros) each day and pay 50 getting across. We stay on the work site a week or more and after that return home."</p>
      <p>He said employers often pay far less than they initially promise.</p>
      <p>"They don't give us the rest because they know we are working without permits."</p>
      <p>- 'No alternative' -</p>
      <p>Khaled Amro from near Hebron didn't realise when he dodged through the fence in October it would be his last time.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old was employed without a permit, but fell from a height and died.</p>
      <p>The police report said he fell from an open elevator while going up to sleep on the roof of a building site near Ramle in central Israel, his brother Muntaser told AFP.</p>
      <p>Khaled had been arrested in the late 1980s so was refused a permit, Muntaser said.</p>
      <p>"He was the head of the family with three kids to support. There is no work in the West Bank," Muntaser said.</p>
      <p>Dakhil Abu Zaid Hamid of the Israeli trade union federation Histadrut said most of the 81 people killed during work incidents this year were Arab.</p>
      <p>Of these 42 died while working on construction sites, according to Kav LaOved, a hotline for workers rights.</p>
      <p>It says the rate of deaths of construction workers is 2.5 times higher than in the European Union, and blames a lack of proper monitoring of work sites.</p>
      <p>Even those with permits face potential exploitation.</p>
      <p>A recent Bank of Israel study found that 20,000 Palestinian workers paid a total of 480 million shekels to middlemen and employers to obtain work permits in Israel.</p>
      <p>It recommended cancelling a requirement that Palestinians work only for a predefined employer.</p>
      <p>Back by the fence, Yunis admits failure for the day -- the police are out in force and in daylight his chances of crossing undetected are slim.</p>
      <p>In total around 80 people were arrested that morning, according to police figures.</p>
      <p>Yunis said he had little choice to try again another day.</p>
      <p>"I am not afraid of death, there is no alternative."</p>
