      <p>Sometimes, there’s reason for worry and nothing we can do about it, at least for now. Then, distraction may be a good alternative. Perhaps you’ll find something sufficiently compelling in the list below.</p>
      <p>Or you find yourself bored, perhaps after work or on the weekend. Sure, if you could motivate yourself, you’d get out and exercise, see a friend, work on your novel, but you’re not motivated—You’re in the no-win of feeling bored yet not energized enough to do much. The suggestions below may help.</p>
      <p>Worry and/or boredom too often results in drugs or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/alcohol">alcohol</a>. It’s so easy—Just open the bottle or pull out the vape pen and you’re not bored anymore; you're blitzed. And if you want some weed, endless billboards tell us to just click and it will materialize at your door.</p>
      <p>What to do? Often in writing <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-help">self-help</a> advice, I feel the need to issue the disclaimer that there are no, ahem, magic pills, but might any of these be helpful?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why are you bored?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Feeling inept?</i><b> </b>Sometimes, you feel you can't do anything right so why, after work, face more possible failure? That can be a downward spiral: The less you do, the less you feel you can do. A possible answer lies in the proverbial baby steps. What's something recreational you could do that you'd very likely succeed at? Drawing an abstract? Practicing your free throws? Singing along with and maybe dancing along with a YouTube music video? Tutoring a child? Fostering a doggie?</p>
      <p><i>Are you too sad to want to do much? </i>Whether it’s transient sadness, enduring sadness (dysthemia) or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/depression">depression</a> (deep dives in between periods of relative normalcy), do you want to ride it out? Force yourself to take a baby step upward? See a clinician? Try or adjust an <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ssris">antidepressant</a>? Personally speaking, a cup of coffee or listening to pump-it-up music helps me, and they don’t hurt my body.</p>
      <p><i>Might your world be too small? </i>Have you been in a rut, doing the same thing all the time even though it’s feeling inadequate? If so, should you reach out to an old friend, try to make a new one, join something that meets regularly: a MeetUp, volunteer organization, religious group, book club, activity group from hiking club to bowling league?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fixes?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Baby steps.</i> Could you muster some easy, baby steps to improve your life: clean up one corner of one room, eat more mindfully, browse <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mating">dating</a> profiles, or search LInkedIn's job ads?</p>
      <p><i>Make your fave activities easy to do.</i> What’s an activity or two that you might actually consider doing, even if you're not feeling very motivated?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let’s say you like reading. Place the book, magazine, or website you’d most enjoy reading in full view, ideally in the spot you’re most likely seeing when thinking about what to do, maybe the spot where your booze or drug paraphernalia are in full view. You’ll reduce temptation by getting those out of sight: in a cabinet or, making it even harder, a locked cabinet?</li>
        <li>Or let’s say you resist most exercise but don’t mind walking. Make it easy to do that: Stick your favorite walking shoes or sneakers in full view and take a moderately vigorous walk along your favorite route, perhaps rewarding yourself by postponing dinner until after your daily walk.</li>
        <li>Maybe you like the idea of a creative activity: playing guitar or writing a short story, but it’s frustrating. What would make it easier and more motivating? Taking a lesson to get you over the hump? Joining a writer’s group?</li>
        <li>You like video games but are impeded by the ridicule that non-players tend to heap. Recognize that video games can be not just an amazing escape but be more interactive and requiring of thinking skills than are other more respected activities—shopping and sports come to mind. Again, make it easy: What game would be most pleasurable? Would you rather play solo, an online multiplayer game, or invite a friend over for a friendly <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">competition</a>? I would think that many Psychology Today readers prefer gentler games. My fave is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp7EaJtlD-E">Stardew Valley</a>, in which you build a farm from scratch, become part of a community, explore caves, and make friends and lovers. Addictive. Wait for the update, Version 1.4, which will be released for PC on Nov. 26.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other ways to address boredom or distract yourself from worry:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bury yourself in work. Stay longer at work, bring some home?</li>
        <li>Help someone. Call a needy friend? Volunteer somewhere, like tutor at a school or library? Be a Big Brother/Big Sister?</li>
        <li>Garden.</li>
        <li>Drive--Uber and Lyft jobs are easy and fast to get. There may be little room left in your brain for worrying if you’re talking to customers while negotiating traffic and or listening to the radio.</li>
        <li>Take on a physical challenge: Ski, rock-climb, train for a 10K. These tend to be absorbing.</li>
        <li>Write: fiction, non-fiction, whatever. It uses all your brain, leaving little left for worry.</li>
        <li>Clean. Your car? The room you’re most motivated to clean? The tub? I’ll bet it has all sorts of crud in all sorts of corners.</li>
        <li>Tackle your to-do list's optionals. Want to rearrange your living room, search for a better deal on your pricey insurance, call that relative you know you should call?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Never mind?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Or perhaps it’s okay to be bored or even to worry. Most of our lives are packed, even as kids: ballet, soccer, church, atop school and homework. Some of my life’s favorite moments occurred when, while pretty darn idle. I just stared: at clouds, at cars driving by, at snowflakes light on a window, or listen to favorite music again and again. For example, I have set <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ6Mzvh3XCc">Spiegel im Spiegel</a> on <a href="https://m.wikihow.com/Loop-YouTube-Videos">repeat</a> and have often listened to that 10-minute piece a few times in a row.</p>
      <p>So, what if anything do you want to add to or subtract from your repertoire of responses to boredom or worry?</p>
