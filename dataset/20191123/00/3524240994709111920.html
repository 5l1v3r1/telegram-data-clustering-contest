      <p><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b> has become unsettled at Juventus.</p>
      <p>That’s according to Okdiario’s chief pundit Eduardo Inda, speaking on <i>El Chiringuito.</i></p>
      <p>Inda suggests Ronaldo could leave Juve by mutual agreement should they fail to win the Champions League this season.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Ronaldo will seek a club capable of winning the Champions League, while Juve will be happy to move him on in order to make room for Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba and PSG star Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>He explained, “He could leave Juventus at the end of the season if he does not win the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“Juve wants to sign Pogba and Mbappé and for the salary limit they have to sell to Cristiano.”</p>
