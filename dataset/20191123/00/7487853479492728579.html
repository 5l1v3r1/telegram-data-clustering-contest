      <h1>Harry Kane Set to Stay at Tottenham as Jose Mourinho Issues Hands-Off Warning</h1>

      <p>Harry Kane looks set to stay at Tottenham Hotspur after new coach Jose Mourinho addressed speculation over the forward's future.</p>
      <p>The England captain has spent his entire senior career on Spurs' books, scoring 174 goals in 268 appearances since making his debut in 2011. However, there have been growing fears the 26-year-old will leave the club, with Mauricio Pochettino's sacking on Tuesday sending the rumour mill into overdrive.</p>

      <p>Spanish superpowers <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/barca">​Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/real-madrid">​Real Madrid</a> have each been linked with a move for the striker in the coming months, though the Catalans appreciate a <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6502164-barcelona-s-long-list-of-transfer-targets-for-2020-revealed?view_source=players_page&amp;view_medium=[harry-kane]">​deal will be hard to come by</a>. <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">​Liverpool</a> are likely to face similar issues, despite <a href="https://www.90min.com/posts/6501228-liverpool-legend-insists-reds-should-target-harry-kane-after-mauricio-pochettino-s-spurs-exit?view_source=players_page&amp;view_medium=[harry-kane]">​claims</a> they should look to snap him up.</p>
      <p>Speaking at his press conference ahead of <a href="http://90min.com/teams/tottenham">the Lilywhites'</a> meeting with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">​West Ham United</a> on Saturday, Mourinho addressed Kane's future, saying (as quoted by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jose-mourinho-warns-europes-biggest-20938548">​Mirror</a>): "He’s one of the best strikers in the world, no doubt. He just needs his team [to be] with him.</p>
      <p>"If his team is England or if his team is Tottenham, he just needs his team to go with him to the next level. And what is the next level? Titles. I think he needs to win, with us, with England.</p>
      <p>"He needs to bring something to highlight the quality that he has as a player. The goals he scores, what he brings to the team - top striker. And I’ve worked with some of the top ones."</p>

      <p>It was suggested Mourinho had agreed to take over at Spurs on the condition Kane stayed in north London, but the Portuguese denied this was the case. He continued: "This is not about me. This is about [chairman Daniel] Levy, this is about the club. </p>
      <p>"[Levy] has a vision, and part of that vision is to make the club better, bigger. There is no better and bigger football club without a bigger and better football team. So keep the best players, is obviously part of that plan.</p>
      <p>"[Kane remaining] was not like a promise to me. It was not like I said ‘I only go if’ - there were no ‘ifs’.</p>
      <p>"It was [Levy's decision], part of his explanation about his vision for the club. He told me he does not sell players when the manager doesn’t want to sell."</p>
