      <p>TOKYO, Nov 23 (MENA) - Pope Francis has arrived in Japan, marking the first visit to the country by a pontiff in 38 years, NHK news reported. <br/><br/>A special plane carrying the pope landed at Tokyo's Haneda Airport shortly before 5:30 p.m. on Saturday. <br/><br/>He was greeted by Japan's Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, Catholic school students and others. <br/><br/>The pontiff will stay in Japan for four days. On Sunday, he will visit the atomic-bombed cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, where he is expected to call for the abolition of nuclear weapons. <br/><br/>On Monday, he will meet Japanese Emperor Naruhito and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Tokyo. <br/><br/>He will also meet survivors of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan, and Japanese youth. Later, the pope will hold a Mass at Tokyo Dome. <br/><br/>On Tuesday, he will deliver a speech at Tokyo's Sophia University before leaving Japan to return to the Vatican. <br/><br/>With about 1.3 billion Catholics worldwide, attention is focused on what messages the influential head of the Roman Catholic Church will deliver to the world.</p>
