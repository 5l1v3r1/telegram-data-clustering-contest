        <b>Former Sheffield United player Harry Maguire is delighted to see his old club flying high on their return to the Premier League.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/h-maguire-158855/">Harry Maguire</a> is delighted to see his <b>boyhood club Sheffield United </b>flying high in the Premier League and <b>wants them to win every game</b> - unless they are playing <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United.</a></p>
      <p>England centre-back Maguire became<b> the world's most expensive defender</b> when he moved to Old Trafford in a reported <b>£80million deal from Leicester City</b> in the previous transfer window.</p>
      <p>The<b> 26-year-old</b> came through the Blades' academy and made over <b>100 senior appearances </b>for the club before leaving to join Hull City in 2014.</p>
      <p>Maguire gets the chance to play at <b>Bramall Lane</b> again on Sunday, as the Red Devils - who sit a point behind the Blades - face<b> Chris Wilder's side.</b></p>
      <p>"It means so much, <b>the club that gave me the chance of fulfilling my dream </b>of becoming a professional footballer," Maguire told BBC Sport when asked about his return.</p>

      <p><b>"I owe them a lot, </b>I go back and support them whenever I can". </p>
      <p>"It's the first result I look for when I get off the pitch.<b> I want to see them win every game they play,</b> apart from when we're playing against them. A fantastic club and it's great to see them back in the Premier League where they belong</p>
      <p>Maguire acknowledged<b> he is unlikely to get much in the way of support </b>from friends as he visits his old club - but insists his loved ones will be cheering him on.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully<b> I'll be the one smiling with my friends </b>and not them," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure some of [my friends] will be supporting Sheffield United, but<b> my family will be supporting Man United</b> and hoping we get the three points."</p>
