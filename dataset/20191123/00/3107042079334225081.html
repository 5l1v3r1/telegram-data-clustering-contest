      <p>The decision was unanimous.Â The jury took about five hours to reach its decision.</p>
      <p>Her parents were in the public gallery for the verdict.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old man stood motionless in the dock as the verdict was read out.</p>
      <p>He was remanded in custody for sentencing on February 21.</p>
      <p>The verdict ends nearly a year of heartbreak for the British backpacker's family.</p>
      <p>Justice Moore told the jury it had been a particularly difficult trial and discharged them from further jury service for the next seven years.</p>
      <p>She had set out on her OE and had only been in New Zealand for 10 days when her life was cruelly snuffed out during sex with a man, 27, she had met earlier that night on Tinder. She died on the eve of her 22nd birthday in December last year.</p>
      <p>The Crown said her killer spent five to 10 minutes strangling her and then took "trophy" photos of her body. He then created a "labyrinth of storytelling and lies" while calmly disposing of her body and other evidence.</p>
      <p>After Millane died, her killer searched on Google for "hottest fire".</p>
      <p>Several pornography sites were then accessed and videos viewed.</p>
      <p>At 1.59am on the night she died a photo of a naked woman was taken using his phone.</p>
      <p>Further internet searches included "car hire Auckland", "time in London", "large sports bags", "flesh-eating birds" and "are there vultures in New Zealand?"</p>
      <p>Earlier this afternoon, the High Court at Auckland jury had returned to the court to ask the judge a question - and the jury foreperson had indicated that a verdict would not be be far away.</p>
      <p>Justice Simon Moore provided his closing remarks and directions to the jury this morning.</p>
      <p>After deliberating for the afternoon the jury knocked on the courtroom door to ask a question.</p>
      <p>They asked: "Does 'when he applied pressure' referring to when he started to apply pressure at the beginning or can it refer to any time when he applied pressure?"</p>
      <p>Justice Moore said: "It is not limited to the beginning. It can be at any time during the application of force leading to death."</p>
      <p>The jury's foreperson told the judge and court that their deliberation wouldn't take much longer and they were likely to reach a verdict this evening.</p>
      <p>The Crown alleges the accused strangled the British backpacker to death and then took "trophy" photos of her body.</p>
      <p>But the defence claims the 27-year-old "freaked out" after an accidental death during sex.</p>
