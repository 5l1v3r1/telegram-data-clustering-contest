      <h1>West Ham 2-3 Tottenham: Report, Ratings &amp; Reaction as Jose Mourinho Wins First Game in Charge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/12955694" target="_blank">Ben Carter</a></address>
      <p>​Jose Mourinho won his first game in charge of Tottenham thanks to goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane away at West Ham, surviving a late comeback to pick up three points on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane had the ball in the back of the net inside the opening three minutes but his goal was correctly ruled out for offside by the linesman, however even match official couldn't stop Son Heung-min from putting the visitors into the lead with a left-footed shot across the goalkeeper half an hour later.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/dele-alli">Alli</a> played a big role in the opening goal, and the England international was pivotal again for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">Tottenham's</a> second as an improvised pass released <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/son-heung-min">Son</a>, who squared a pass for Lucas Moura who had the simple tap in at the far post.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/players/harry-kane">Kane</a> finally got in on the act just after the break to move clear as Tottenham's third-highest goalscorer of all time, racing onto the end of an inch-perfect cross from Serge Aurier to put the game out of sight.</p>
      <p>Substitute Michail Antonio pulled one goal back for <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">West Ham</a>, who even added a second goal with their last kick of the game, but it was too little too late for the hosts and Tottenham held on to pick up their first win under Mourinho.</p>

      <h3>West Ham</h3>
      <h4>Key Talking Point</h4>
      <p>There were spells of the match where West Ham looked dangerous, but for the most part it was a performance that has all-but handed Manuel Pellegrini his P45.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>It was all too easy for Tottenham to work their way into attacking areas and into positions where they could get shots off at an out of form Sergi Roberto, but it was a crippling lack of quality going forward that ensured West Ham always had an impossible mountain to climb.</p>

      <p>Substitutes: Antonio (7), Fornals (6), Sanches (5).</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Star Man</h4>
      <p>He might be turning 33 before the end of the season, but Mark Noble proved exactly why he's still such a valuable part of West Ham's first-team on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Sitting alongside Declan Rice - they were up against Dele Alli and Harry Winks all afternoon - Noble absolutely commanded the midfield, often acting as the link between defence and attack after Declan Rice broke up the play.</p>
      <p>Noble produced a handful of world-class passes which helped West Ham get into their most dangerous positions, but there wasn't enough from his teammates to stop the club falling to yet another defeat this season.</p>

      <h3>Tottenham Hotspur</h3>
      <h4>Key Talking Point</h4>
      <p>Fans would have been hoping for a new manager bounce after Mourinho took over the reins from Mauricio Pochettino earlier this week - and that's exactly what they got.</p>
      <p>Lethargic performances, especially away from home, have become the norm for Tottenham over the last few months, but this weekend fans were treated to a much better team performance where almost every player worked their socks off.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>It might have been a match where both sides were more focused on not losing the game initially, but Spurs went on to cruise in the London derby and showed a lot of signs of improvement under Mourinho already.</p>

      <h4>Player Ratings</h4>
      <p>Gazzaniga (6); Aurier (6), Alderweireld (6), Sanchez (6), Davies (6); Dier (6), Winks (7), Alli (9*); Moura (6), Son (7), Kane (8).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Substitutes: Eriksen (6), Sissoko (6), Rose (6).</p>
      <hr/>
      <h4>Star Man</h4>
      <p>He's largely been forgotten about in recent months, but Dele Alli put in one of his best-ever performances in a Spurs shirt to carry them to three points on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was at the heart of everything Tottenham produced creatively and he even popped up in defensive areas to help out Eric Dier.</p>

      <p>Alli couldn't get himself on the scoresheet and was eventually replaced by Christian Eriksen, but it was a performance that showed the England international is still one of the best attacking midfielders in Europe.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>Things don't get any easier for Manuel Pellegrini's West Ham as they face back to back away trips to Chelsea and then Wolves.</p>
      <p>Tottenham will break for Champions League football in midweek before hosting Eddie Howe's Bournemouth next weekend.</p>
