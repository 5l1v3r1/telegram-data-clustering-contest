      <p>MADRID (AP) - Luis Suárez and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arturo-vidal/">Arturo Vidal</a> scored second-half goals to lead <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a>’s recovery in a 2-1 win at last-place Leganés in the Spanish league on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Suárez headed in a pass from Lionel Messi in the 53rd minute to cancel out Youssef En-Nesyri’s opener. Substitute <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arturo-vidal/">Vidal</a> put <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> in front after a defensive error with 11 minutes left.</p>
      <p>Leganés was close to taking a point against the defending champions until midfielder Rubén Pérez knocked a corner toward his own net, allowing an unmarked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arturo-vidal/">Vidal</a> to tap in the winner.</p>
      <p>“We pulled out a win at a very tough pitch against a team that is fighting for its life,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arturo-vidal/">Vidal</a> said.</p>
      <p>“We have to improve and keep teams from scoring against us early. But the important thing is that we took the three points and keep the lead.”</p>

      <p>The hard-fought victory left <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> three points ahead of second-place Real Madrid, which hosts Real Sociedad later.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> hosts Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> coach Ernesto Valverde aligned his top four attacking players in a starting XI for the first time this season, with Ousmane Dembele and Antoine Griezmann flanking Messi and Suárez.</p>
      <p>But Leganés in its second game under former Mexico manager Javier Aguirre stifled <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> in the first half with its two tight defensive lines packed in front of its box.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>The hosts took a 12th-minute lead after Pérez passed to Roque Mesa, who went on to play the ball wide to En-Nesyri. The Morocco striker finished the move by curling home a left-footed strike that gave Marc-Andre ter Stegen no chance.</p>
        <p>En-Nesyri has scored in three consecutive rounds, including a late equalizer to earn a 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad in Aguirre’s debut.</p>
        <p>The closest <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a> came to scoring before halftime was a header from Suárez that goalkeeper Iván Cuéllar stretched to push wide.</p>
        <p>The visitors improved after the break with Messi playing a key role.</p>
        <p>Gerard Pique headed a corner kick from Messi off the post. Minutes later Messi earned a free kick from a foul outside the area. The Argentine found Suárez with a lob that Suárez headed under Cuéllar to start the comeback.</p>
        <p>Valverde reinforced his midfield with Ivan Rakitic and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arturo-vidal/">Vidal</a>. They replaced an ineffective Griezmann and Sergio Busquets, who had picked up a yellow card that will mean he is suspended for next round’s trip to Atlético Madrid.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/arturo-vidal/">Vidal</a>’s goal was his fourth of the campaign.</p>
        <p>Right back Moussa Wague made his first appearance of the season for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/barcelona/">Barcelona</a>, which was without the suspended Sergi Roberto and injured defenders Jordi Alba and Nelson Semedo.</p>
