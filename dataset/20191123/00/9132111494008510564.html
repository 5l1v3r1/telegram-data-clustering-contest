      <p>Member of Parliament for Yapei Kusawgu, John Jinapor, has accused the Akufo-Addo-led administration of spending a ‘chunk of the nation’s oil revenue on consumption instead of infrastructural investment and capital expenditure’.</p>
      <p>According to him, the administration has also failed on its promises to deliver some GHS200 million to the Zongo Development Fund as well as the Special Development Fund.</p>
      <p>“What is more worrying is that a chunk of our oil revenue is being used for consumption instead of investing in infrastructure and investing in capital expenditure, so clearly, what the government is saying in their budget is nothing but mere talk and propaganda because there’s nothing to show for it on the ground,” John Jinapor said this in an interview with reporters.</p>
      <p>He added that “many Ghanaians are suffering at the hands of the Akufo-Addo led administration and cannot continue to have its government in place”</p>
      <p>Jinapor called on Ghanaians to join what he says “is a rescue mission” to save this country from the level of suffering by the Akufo-Addo government.</p>
      <p>“The Akufo-Addo administration has run out of ideas and they’re running on propaganda to blame the previous administration, they just rehashed and copied from the 2018 budget so it’s clearly a budget that is full of disappointments,” he concluded.</p>
