      <h1>Tory Lanez’s CHIXTAPE 5 Album Narrowly Misses No. 1 In First-Week Sales</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:51:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:51</time> by <a rel="author">Rosario Harper</a></address>
      <p>Canadian hip-hop artist <b>Tory Lanez</b> has plenty to brag about. The rap crooner’s new <i>Chixtape 5</i> album is expected to sell nearly 100,000 copies in its opening week.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Lanez’s latest solo effort <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8544442/celine-dion-courage-aiming-number-1-debut-billboard-200">will miss out on the top spot</a> on Billboard with <b>Celine Dion</b>‘s <i>Courage</i> pushing out around 120,000 copies.</p>
      <blockquote>Also heading for a high debut on the next Billboard 200 is Tory Lanez’s new <i>Chixtape 5</i> album. Forecasters suggest it could possibly bow at No. 2 with around 90,000 equivalent album units earned. If it starts as expected, it would secure Lanez is fourth consecutive top 5-charting effort. (Billboard)</blockquote>
      <p>Some initial estimates had the project <a href="https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-is-losing-money-on-chixtape-5-due-to-sample-clearance-costs">selling at least 65,000 units</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>The album features artists like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lil-wayne">Lil Wayne</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ashanti">Ashanti</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ludacris">Ludacris</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Jagged-edge">Jagged Edge</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Mario">Mario</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Mya">Mýa</a>. Ashanti pulls double duty as the cover star, too. <i>Chixtape 5</i> is projected to move 65,000 – 75,000 equivalent album units in its first week, which would be the best sales week of his career if it holds up. (Genius)</blockquote>
      <p>In a recent interview, Lanez <a href="https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-is-losing-money-on-chixtape-5-due-to-sample-clearance-costs">admitted he put together</a> the album for the love of music and not financial gain.</p>
      <blockquote>“We actually didn’t do this from a monetary standpoint, we did this from a standpoint of like, I’m losing money doing the album but what is gonna come out of it? Of course it’s gonna be incredible. I feel like it’s damn near at a place where it’s gonna be critically acclaimed because no one ever did it before.” (Hot 97)</blockquote>
