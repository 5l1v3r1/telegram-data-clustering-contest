      <p>Samson Lardy Anyenini sits with his panel to discuss relevant issues that made headlines during the week.</p>
      <p>The three-hour show begins with a discussion on a campaign for the consumption of local rice as the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) says it is in talks with 20 major importers of rice into Ghana to get them to rely on locally produced rice for both domestic consumption and export.</p>
      <p>Ahead of that, some prominent personalities including the CEO of OmniMedia Samuel Attah-Mensah and musician Wiyaala have thrown their weights behind the campaign.</p>
      <p>The spotlight will also be put on the battle between the Economic and Organised Crime Office (EOCO) and the Auditor-General as the latter has filed a suit against the former for investigating him over certain procurement discrepancies at the audit service.</p>
      <p>The Auditor-General is seeking among other reliefs, a declaration from the court that EOCO has no “statutory mandate to investigate the Audit Service for any breaches under the Public Procurement Act, 2003 (Act 663)”.</p>
      <p>He also wants an order of injunction restraining EOCO, its officers, agents or any of assigns from investigating the Audit Service over any alleged procurement breaches.</p>
      <p>Also to be discussed is the December 17 referendum which has stoked debate in the country. A nationwide referendum will be conducted on December 17, 2019, to enable citizens to decide if an entrenched clause in the 1992 Constitution Article 55(3) needs to be amended to permit political parties in Ghana to participate in local government election.</p>
      <p>While the ruling New Patriotic Party is going for a ‘YES’, the opposition is urging electorate to vote ‘NO’.</p>
