      <p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - An electric company faces a deadline to respond to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-cuomo/">Gov. Andrew Cuomo</a>’s threat to revoke the utility’s certificate to offer natural gas service in downstate New York</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-cuomo/">Cuomo</a> sent a Nov. 13 letter to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-grid/">National Grid</a> on Tuesday giving the company 14 days to respond.</p>
      <p>That deadline will be up by midweek.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-grid/">National Grid</a> denied natural gas service to over 1,100 customers since May. The company blamed New York’s rejection of an application for a $1 billion pipeline bringing natural gas from Pennsylvania’s shale gas fields.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/andrew-cuomo/">Cuomo</a> says such a pipeline wouldn’t be in service until at least next year. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-grid/">National Grid</a> has since reversed course and begun connecting customers.</p>
