      <p>Bureaucracy, it’s been said, defends the status quo long past the time when the quo has lost its status.Most anyone who’s stood in line to get a drivers license or been put on hold at the utility company knows what bureaucracy feels like: Frustrating. Wasteful. Slow-moving. Unnecessarily complex.  </p>
      <p>The federal government has a well-earned reputation for being bureaucratic. In fact, fairly or not, government employees are often called “bureaucrats.” The term is usually not offered as a compliment.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon, home of the U.S. military and brain center of the nation’s defense, is no stranger to bureaucracy. The annual budget of the Department is Defense is in the neighborhood of $700 billion, equal to all the other federal government agencies combined. Nearly 30,000 military and civilian employees work at the Pentagon. So there’s naturally plenty of opportunity for bureaucratic red tape. </p>
      <p>Clearing the way for smart decision-making and prudent spending of both time and treasure is a major role for the Secretary of Defense.</p>
      <p>Ash Carter served in that role under President Barack Obama. Prior to that, he worked for more than 30 years in numerous jobs in the DOD, beginning as a physicist charged with safeguarding American from Soviet nuclear threats.</p>
      <p>Carter shares his thoughts on leading a complex and sprawling organization in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2Owp40V"><i>Inside the Five-Sided Box: Lessons from a Lifetime of Leadership in the Pentagon</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p><b>Rodger Dean Duncan: </b>After decades of dealing with the bureaucratic maze of the Pentagon, what’s your advice on how to break down (or avoid the formation of) operational silos in a business organization?</p>
      <figure>

      <p><b>Ash Carter: </b>When I had my first job in the Pentagon in the Reagan Administration, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was said to have the worst staff in the building. Good officers were assigned plum roles in their Army, Navy, etc. silos; but only second-raters were assigned to joint duty like the Chairman’s staff outside of their service silo. Today, joint duty is a requirement to get to the top in any service, so working for the Chairman is a plum job. Moving good people around among silos keeps them learning, gives them the broad view of the enterprise you want them to have, and might prevent them from hopping to another job just to get out of their rut.</p>
      <p><b>Duncan: </b>What are three operational practices at the Pentagon that should be considered by business people who want to succeed, and what are three Pentagon practices that should be avoided?</p>
      <p><b>Carter: </b>1. People are surprised when I tell them that the “hidebound” Pentagon is actually a capable and deliberate learning organization. After some initial stumbles, we climbed on top of new challenges: counterinsurgency, rapid fielding of protections against buried bombs, treatment of amputees and post-traumatic stress, integration of women into close combat roles, and rebuilding the bridges to high-tech industry that had once spawned GPS and the Internet. After every raid, hostage rescue, or battle, we did after-action reviews to learn from and take responsibility for our mistakes.</p>
      <p>2. The U.S. military has a habit of making good use of history to suggest analogies and recycle valuable tactics, as well as to get to know friends and find the weaknesses of enemies. If you think about it, historical thinking is the dominant methodology of real leaders. They don’t really use fancy political science, economics, or psychology theories. They operate from historical analogy and personal experience. Disciplined use of history worked well for us at the Pentagon. A lot of my friends in the tech world would have avoided much trouble if they had mixed a little reflection on history with their admirable drive to disrupt it.</p>
      <p>3. The military responds best to a leader who shows clarity and consistency. That’s not because they have some “command and control” mindset, but because it shows them that you know what you are doing and mean it, and they know their part in execution. When beginning the war against ISIS, I used the “two red arrows” pointing toward Mosul and Raqqa image over and over and over again to show the path to victory, until every private knew the essence of the war.</p>
      <p><b>Duncan: </b>What are some common practices in the private enterprise world that have not yet been—but should be—adopted at the Pentagon?</p>

      <p><b>Carter: </b>First, the Pentagon still needs to move faster in deploying technology. In my “weapon czar,” COO, and then CEO (Secretary of Defense) roles I could still see the remnants of the Cold War procurement style, where the Soviet Union lumbered along slowly and steadily and we could too. Today’s strategic scene features fierce competition from many directions—China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and terrorists. They are all out to get us; we have to counter them all.</p>
      <p>I had the notion of agile tech both from my physics background and my role as supplier to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Nobody wants a war with China, but to avoid one, we need more of the same spirit taken to the China threat that we took to ISIS – what would we wish we had done today if conflict breaks out tomorrow?</p>
      <p>Second, the Pentagon needs to keep building bridges to the commercial technology and supplier base. When I began my defense career in the 1980s, almost everything new in technology originated in America, and much of that came from defense. Those days are gone. To be the best military in the world technologically is not a birthright, and it can’t be done within our five-sided walls. We need to be up to date with, and source from, the larger commercial technology base.</p>
      <p><b>Duncan: </b>A lot of retired military officers enter the business world as leaders. What kind of adjustments are required to transition from a command-and-control military environment to a civilian world that is less responsive to a “my way or the highway” approach to leadership?</p>
      <p><b>Carter: </b>The officers who worked with or for me mostly adjusted easily to the civilian business world. The other proof point that military and business leadership are not that different is the turnaround in business attitudes towards veterans. Ten years ago when I talked to business leaders about hiring veterans, they acted like they were doing me a favor. By the time I left office they were trying to hire away some of our best – both a compliment and a challenge for the Department. That’s because our people, military and civilian, are buttoned-down and disciplined, results-oriented, and used to strategic planning.</p>
      <p><b>Duncan: </b>How can leaders make best use of emerging technologies without getting mesmerized by the “look at my new toy” syndrome?</p>
      <p><b>Carter: </b>AI (artificial intelligence) and big data will have a big impact on the military, but you have to avoid being mesmerized by new tech. For example, I wrote the policy on autonomous weapons, and its key precept is that systems must be designed to ensure enough transparency in how they work that commanders can reasonably predict their actions and be held accountable for the consequences (for example, friendly fire or civilian casualties by mistake “because way back in 2012 the AI said so”). In other words, you need to be able to situate sturdy and lasting operational values within the new tech context.</p>
