      <p>A historical play, Emotan, is set to go on stage again at the Agip Hall, MUSON Centre, Lagos</p>
      <p>Written and directed by William Benson, the play which is produced by Joseph Edgar of Duke of Shomolu Productions, will run from December 22 through to December 25, 2019.</p>
      <p>The play features notable thespians like Elvina Ibru, Yemi Shodimu, Olu Okekanye, Aisha Sanni-Shittu, Queeneth Ejezie and Williams Ekpo. Others are Amos Olutokun, Eferhogene Awusa, Amaka Onuoha, Chantal Edgar, Edgarl Saba and David Aisekhalaye.</p>
      <p>The play, Emotan, tries to retell the wonderful story of the deity, Emotan, and the role she played in stabilizing the Benin Monarchy. She was also credited with setting up the very first Kindergarten in the city. Emotan was the custodian of Bini children as their mothers went to the markets. The values she instilled in the wards under her care is said to have gone a long way in building the Ancient Benin Kingdom into the power house it was.</p>
      <p>“Bini traditional dirges adding more than enough spice making the production a must-watch,” Elvina said.</p>

      <p>“Emotan is geared to deliver breath taking dance and song sequences that will take audiences into the exotic and rich Benin Ancestry driving them through the drama, suspense and intrigues that remain essential to nation-building while not forgetting the powerfully entrancing romance and love affairs that wafted through the tensions of the era.”</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of the Lagos show, the Executive producer, Joseph Edgar said this is coming after the successful showing of the play at the just concluded National Festival for Arts and Culture which held in Benin, Edo State. Edgar said that the play was the highlight of the festival which saw over 500,000 people descend on the ancient city.</p>
      <p>The show pulled in the first lady of Edo State, Mrs Betsy Obaseki, the Director General National Council for Arts and Culture, Otunba Segun Runsewe, legendary music maestro, Sir Victor Uwaifo and other Edo State officials.</p>
