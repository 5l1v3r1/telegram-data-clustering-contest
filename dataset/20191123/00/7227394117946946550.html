      <h1>vivo V17 goes official, it's a rebranded S1 Pro</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=39" target="_blank">Sagar</a></address>
      <p>After announcing the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_v17_neo-9783.php">V17 Neo</a> and <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_v17_pro-9849.php">V17 Pro</a> in August and September respectively, vivo has announced the vanilla <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_v17-9966.php">V17</a>. But, it's not exactly a new phone. It's actually a rebranded <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_s1_pro-9972.php">S1 Pro</a> that was launched in the Philippines earlier this week.</p>
      <p>The vivo V17 is built around a 6.38" Super AMOLED display that has a 2340x1080 pixel resolution and a fingerprint reader underneath for biometric security. It has also a notch up top housing the 32MP selfie camera.</p>
      <p>Around the back, the V17 has a 48MP main camera joined by an 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensor modules arranged in a diamond formation.</p>

      <p>On the inside, the vivo V17 has a Snapdragon 665 SoC coupled with 8GB RAM, and it runs Android Pie-based Funtouch OS 9.2 out of the box.</p>
      <p>The smartphone comes in a single 128GB storage option, but it does have a microSD card slot allowing storage expansion by up to 256GB.</p>
      <p>Fueling the entire package is a 4,500 mAh battery that draws power through a USB-C port and supports 18W fast charging. The smartphone also has the 3.5mm headphone jack and comes with an NFC chip for contact-less payments.</p>
