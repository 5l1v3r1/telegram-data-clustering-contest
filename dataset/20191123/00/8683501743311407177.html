      <p>This past summer, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1663460/upcoming-fast-and-furious-movies-list-of-titles-and-release-dates">the long-running <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> franchise</a> finally diverged into <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483009/a-very-specific-fast-and-furious-scene-led-to-the-creation-of-hobbs-and-shaw">spinoff territory with <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i></a>, reuniting Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Jason Statham’s respective characters for their own insane adventure. The spinoff ended up collecting over $758 million worldwide, and has rightfully generated speculation about if <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2</i> is on the way.</p>
      <p>On that subject, <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2</i> producer Hiram Garcia says that Universal is pleased with how the movie performed, and that there are talks underway about the future of this corner of the <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> world. As Garcia put it:</p>
      <blockquote>We are having conversations, we were so happy with how it did. The studio was extremely happy and there’s been a lot of great conversations just about seeing where things lay out. Obviously [<i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i>] is on its way. That’s going to do great things. Taking some bits from that, cause it’s all a shared universe and it’s all in the works.</blockquote>
      <p>So while nothing is cemented just yet, judging by what Hiram Garcia said, it sounds like there’s a solid chance of <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2</i> becoming a reality. When we’ll know for sure if a sequel is moving forward, that’s hard to say, but sometimes it’s necessary to wait for good news. After all, <i>Mission: Impossible - Fallout</i> quickly became the most critically and commercially successful installment in the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> franchise, but it wasn’t until half a year later that we learned <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465139/two-new-mission-impossible-movies-are-confirmed-with-a-cool-twist">two more sequels would be filmed back-to-back</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> certainly planted the seeds for a sequel through the mysterious director of the Eteon organization that Idris Elba’s Brixton was working for. The plan is for Eteon’s director to eventually physically appear in a future movie, and <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2</i> is as good a place as any for that to happen. While Keanu Reeves was once being <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477414/no-keanu-reeves-was-never-going-to-play-the-villain-in-hobbs-and-shaw">considered for the role down the line</a>, a deal couldn’t be reached.</p>
      <p>Luckily for <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> fans, as Hiram Garcia pointed out while speaking with <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/2019/11/22/fast-furious-hobbs-and-shaw-producer-sequel-update-hiram-garcia/">Comicbook.com</a>, it’s not like they’ll be lacking in content in the next several years. Next year, <i>go</i> will pick back up where <i>The Fate of the Furious</i> left off, with filming wrapping up earlier this month. <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i> is also scheduled for 2021, and it will conclude the main <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> film series.</p>
      <p>Even if <i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2</i> doesn’t move forward for some reason, that doesn’t mean the end of Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw’s journeys. While they’re not expected to appear in <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i>, it’s possible they could be thrown into <i>Fast &amp; Furious 10</i>, and Dwayne Johnson <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481214/feud-finished-the-rock-hints-to-fast-and-furious-return-in-vin-diesel-thank-you-post">seemingly hinted that was a possibility a few months back</a>. Whatever the future holds for this franchise, stay tuned to CinemaBlend for updates.</p>
      <p><i>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</i> is now available to watch on Blu-ray, DVD and Digital HD, and <i>Fast &amp; Furious 9</i> will race into theaters on May 22, 2020. Don’t forget to look through our <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456842/new-movie-releases-2019-movie-release-date-schedule">2019 release schedule</a> and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480313/new-movie-releases-2020-movie-release-date-schedule">2020 release schedule</a> to plan what you’ll see on the big screen in the near future accordingly.</p>
