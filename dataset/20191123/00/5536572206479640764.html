      <h1>Steve Belichick Freakishly Sounded Exactly Like His Dad After Latest Interview (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>To become great at anything, you have to put the time in.</p>
      <p>To sounds like one of the greatest coaches in NFL history, apparently all you have to do is be born to the family and spend every moment around him for years.</p>
      <p>Steve Belichick, who is the A Patriots safeties coach, did an interview on Friday and he creeped people out by sounding exactly like his father when speaking.</p>

      <p>Steve is relishing the fact that he gets to spend more time with his father as an adult, because football kept him away at times growing up.</p>
      <p>“Growing up under a football coach, you don’t see your dad as much as you would like to,” Steve Belichick said to <a href="https://www.masslive.com/patriots/2019/11/steve-belichick-bill-belichick-making-up-for-lost-time-on-new-england-patriots-sideline.html">Masslive</a>. “So it was a total flip of the script. I went from not seeing him, seeing him once, twice a week to seeing him too many hours a day. So it took a little adjusting but I couldn’t be happier. We spend a ton of time together and it’s great to learn from somebody like that.”</p>
      <p>“My dad is my role model,” Steve Belichick said. “He’s my idol. I’ve always looked up to him. I’m sure that influenced me getting to where I’ve come. But I’m my own person and I’m just trying to be me.”</p>
      <p>It’s nice to know that Belichick charm will be alive and well long after Bill retires from the game of football.</p>
