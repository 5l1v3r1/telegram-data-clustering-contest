      <p>In what has become a tradition for the financial press, mutual fund giant T. Rowe Price (TROW) presented its 36th annual Global Market Outlook for the coming year in New York Tuesday. The highlight of the event was Chief Investment Officer David Giroux saying that the utility sector will be the group to own over the next five years.</p>
      <p>Giroux, who runs T. Rowe's investment strategy, said these are not your grandpa's utilities and that the common wisdom about the sector is outdated. The industry has seen great change over the past 30 years, in addition the trend of low-cost renewable energy sources, such as wind and sun, is not fully appreciated by the market place</p>
      <p>Climate change is forcing utilities to move away from fossil fuels and toward renewables. Within 20 years, it's expected the nation will get two-thirds of its energy from renewables. Already earnings have experienced significant growth and the long-term risk/reward balance is compelling.</p>
      <p>"We believe utilities offer the best risk-adjusted return opportunities of any sector over the long term, " said Giroux. "Utilities are probably the only sector that would benefit from a [Elizabeth] Warren administration."</p>
      <p>His case for investing in utilities is that the perception of the sector's growth potential is rooted in the past. Unlike telecoms, healthcare and consumer staples, utilities is the only defensive sector without secular risk. Giroux defines secular risk as "the emergence of a new competitive force, technological advance, change in customer habit, and/or regulatory change that is structural and long term. This typically results in a slower top-line growth rate, margin compression, and/or multiple compression."</p>
      <p>He said the conventional wisdom on utilities is that they are purely a rate play and the direction of interest rates is all that matters. This was true in the past. Between 1986 and 1998, the S&amp;P 500 Index saw earnings per share grow 159%, while utility earnings didn't grow at all. This meant that the return from utilities came almost entirely from the dividend. There wasn't growth because of large projects having cost overruns, poor regulatory structures, higher inflation and the rising price of natural gas .</p>
      <p>Giroux said fuel makes up 33% of utilities’ costs, with non-fuel operations making up 26% and depreciation at 14%.</p>
      <p>However, there's been a dramatic change in industry dynamics. The change starts with the move from coal to natural gas, the drop in gas prices because of fracking, and the dramatically lower costs from renewable. This should allow utilities to see accelerating growth in the rate base and profits, while making all their constituencies happy. Regulators and politicians are happy to see more clean energy without asking customers paying more and customers don't see an increase in rates.</p>
      <p>The drop in costs leads to increased profits. Earnings growth rates for the S&amp;P 500 dropped from 8.5% in the period 1986-1998 down to 6.1% now. Meanwhile the earnings growth rate for utilities has jumped from 0.1% in the 1986-1998 periods to 4.1% now.</p>
      <p>"If the market were to trade off 5%, that would be the time to go all in on utilities," said Giroux.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are risks to the value proposition. There could be a ban on fracking leading to higher natural gas prices as well as poor regulation. In addition a rise in interest rates or inflation could lead to a reduction in allowed Returns on Equity (ROE).</p>

      <p>As for the rest of the U.S. equity market, growth has outperformed value across all market caps year-to-date. The market has been choppy and headline driven by a slowing economic environment and volatility from the U.S-China trade war.</p>
      <p>Going forward, "We expect muted returns in 2020 with a wide range of potential outcomes," said John Lineman, T. Rowe's chief investment officer for equities.            </p>
      <p>Even though the bull market is entering its 11th year.  Linehan said bull markets don't die of old age, but rather, an economic downturn, regulatory or political uncertainty, valuation excess, or Federal Reserve policy errors.</p>
      <p>He said while there is an increased probability of a recession, it still isn't high.</p>
      <p>Linehan said increasing geopolitical risk, such as Brexit, the Turkey/Syria conflict, and the Hong Kong unrest, has given rise to populism.</p>
      <p>While market valuations look expensive on a historical basis, it's not outrageous and he said he sees yellow lights, not red, flashing.</p>
      <p>"But compared with fixed income, stocks still look very attractive," said Linehan, "There are really no attractive alternatives to stocks. Our expectation is for slightly positive returns."</p>
      <p>"We are in an environment where innovation and tech advancers are without peer," said Linehan. "The outcomes from these have been quite profound. Many companies have been advantaged and others have been quite disrupted. We think this provides a strong backdrop for growth."</p>
      <p>Over the past 12 years, the Russell 1000 Growth Index rose 124%, while the Russell 1000 Value Index increased half that, 64%.</p>
      <p>Compared with historical norms around the world, valuations are in line or slightly expensive.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the optimist says concerns over the trade war abate, business confidence improves and stocks remain the most attractive asset class. However, the pessimist sees a potential economic downturn, more trade uncertainty, and Election 2020 risk.</p>
      <p>Today, the market is thirstier for defense than yield and momentum stocks that have outperformed look expensive.</p>
      <p>Linehan said he sees opportunities in nondefensive companies with high dividend yields and platform companies with valuation appeal. "But ignore valuation at your peril."</p>
      <p>As for the economic outlook for the U.S., Alan Levenson, T.Rowe's chief U.S. economist, said in the near-term growth will pickup as the latest downdraft in global manufacturing winds down. However, next year the upside for global growth is limited.</p>
      <p>He said the U.S. and China are expected to slow further, even if a trade truce takes hold. Meanwhile, inflation is broadly lower to central bank targets, sustaining the bias toward monetary accommodation. Still, pockets of wage pressure are emerging.</p>
      <p>Globally, the fiscal policy impulse is to be roughly neutral next year</p>
      <p>In conclusion, risks to growth are skewed to the downside.</p>
