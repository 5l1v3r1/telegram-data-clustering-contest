        <b>Pep Guardiola is concerned about an injury sustained by Sergio Aguero as Manchester City got back to winning ways in the Premier League.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-aguero-23530/">Sergio Aguero</a> <b>may have sustained a "bad" injury </b>as <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> earned a comeback Premier League win at home to Chelsea, said manager Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>City only had 46.74 possession against the in-form Blues, the lowest recorded by a Guardiola side in his 381 top-flight matches as a manager, but they collected a crucial three points. N'Golo Kante had given Chelsea a deserved lead by squeezing a clever finish past returning goalkeeper Ederson, but <b>Kevin De Bruyne's deflected shot levelled the score</b> before Riyad Mahrez curled in what proved the winner.</p>

      <p>City's comeback, though, <b>was marred by a trio of injuries </b>to key players as Rodri, David Silva and Aguero all had to be substituted during the second half at Etihad Stadium. Aguero appeared to be in some discomfort as he hobbled off and <b>Guardiola fears the striker could miss some time f</b>or the champions.</p>
      <p>"<b>I think Sergio will be bad</b>, I think so... this feeling, tomorrow [Sunday] we will know," Guardiola told Sky Sports. "We will see tomorrow, <b>the feeling is it is muscular.</b> It is what it is, we have young players and we will try [to cope if Aguero is ruled out]."</p>
