      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Natalie Chou scored all but two of her 19 points in the first half as the No. 11 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-california-los-angeles/">UCLA</a> women jumped to a big early lead and blew past Northern Colorado 92-58 Friday night.</p>
      <p>Chou was 7-of-9 shooting with a trio of 3-pointers, Japreece Dean added 18 points and seven assists while Lindsey Corsaro added 16 points for the Bruins, who are 4-0.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-california-los-angeles/">UCLA</a> has won 65 of its last 73 at Pauley Pavilion.</p>
      <p>Corsaro scored layup for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-california-los-angeles/">UCLA</a> 22 seconds into game and, after a 2-2 tie, Bruins went on a 29-9 run. Lauryn Miller made it 31-11 with a steal at half-court and a driving left-handed layup to end the quarter.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-california-los-angeles/">UCLA</a> opened the second half on an 8-0 run with Michaela Onyenware scoring seven of her nine points in the third quarter. After trailing by 41 in the third, Northern Colorado briefly cut the lead to under 30 points by late in the fourth before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/university-of-california-los-angeles/">UCLA</a> allowed just one point over the final 2:36.</p>
