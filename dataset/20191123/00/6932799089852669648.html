        <b>OnePlus has sent an email to "some of" its customers advising them of a lapse in data protection at the company. In this case, it appears passwords and payment details are safe; however, personal information associated with these consumers may have been stolen. The OEM has asserted that it is investigating the issue and will be tightening their security in the future.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/The-latest-OnePlus-7-and-7-Pro-official-betas-have-November-2019-security-patches.444012.0.html">OnePlus</a> has maintained its own-brand web store since the days of its first phone, the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-One-Smartphone-Review.137677.0.html">One</a>. Now, the OEM has <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/security-notification.1144088/">admitted that</a> an unauthorized third party has gained access to the <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Up-to-63-of-consumers-now-find-connected-devices-creepy.428464.0.html">personal information</a> gathered in the course of its operation. This data includes the names, shipping addresses, email addresses and phone numbers consumers would have used to complete purchases on this site.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the company also <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/security-notification.1144088/">asserts</a> that the accounts set up to do the same remained safe in the course of this breach, as did payment details. This incident was apparently detected as part of routine security checks, and has been reported publicly yesterday (November 22, 2019). However, the potentially affected customers may have received an email informing them of the situation prior to this date.</p>
      <p>OnePlus has <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/security-notification.1144088/">not specified</a> just how many account-holders were affected as a result of this lapse. Nevertheless, these individuals are now at increased risk of <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Phishing-on-social-media-sites-increased-by-nearly-75-in-the-1st-quarter-of-2019.420038.0.html">phishing</a>, spam emails and other types of personal detail misuse as a result of this breach. The OEM claims that it "took immediate steps to stop the intruder" and is "partnering with a world-renowned <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/GoToMeeting-is-found-to-be-potentially-susceptible-to-hacking.442684.0.html">security</a> platform" in December 2019.</p>
