      <h1>Dealing With Sadness During The Holidays</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Stephanie Sarkis</a></address>
      <p>The holidays mean increased sadness, anxiety, and depression for many. You may be missing your family and friends, or you may feel like you don’t have family or friends that you really can connect with. It also doesn’t help that in many areas of the country, gray skies are now predominant. How do you get through the holiday season, when it seems that happiness and togetherness are constantly pushed as the “right” way to do the holidays?</p>
      <h3>Keep Expectations In Check</h3>
      <p>There’s a difference between being optimistic and being rigid about what our holidays “should” look like. You may wonder why the perfect holidays you envision never come to fruition. No one experiences the holidays perfectly. “Perfect” rarely exists, but “good enough” does. Become a friend of “good enough.”</p>
      <p>No matter what happens this holiday season, you will be okay. In fact, some of the best holiday memories are when things didn’t go according to plan. Limit your time on social media, as people tend to compare their holidays to those they see posted online. Remember that people post their “highlight reel” on social media, not their “behind-the-scenes.” Comparison to others is a surefire way to feel disappointed and “less than.” People usually don’t post photos of the turkey getting burned, or their kids screaming before the family holiday photo.</p>
      <h3>Take Time Off</h3>
      <p>Give yourself permission to take a “mental health day” off from work. If you aren’t feeling well, your productivity will be almost nonexistent. Why not give yourself a break, especially when you aren’t going to get much accomplished at work that day anyway. Have a day just doing something you enjoy. You may be telling yourself that you can’t take a day off of work, but you really can’t afford to <i>not </i>take a day off of work. Your emotional wellbeing may depend on it.</p>
      <h3>Talk To A Professional</h3>
      <p>It is okay to not be okay. Talking to a mental health professional can help you untangle the reasons you are having increased difficulties during the holidays. Many times, sadness during the holidays stems from grief. This includes grief over the loss of loved ones, grief over what you thought the holidays would be like, and grief due to loneliness. Talking to a neutral third-party helps give you a perspective that you might not receive from those close to you. Mental health professionals can also help you find solutions and get you out of feeling “stuck.” If you are suicidal, call the <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">National Suicide Prevention Hotline</a> at 1-800-273-8255.</p>
      <h3>Cut Back on Alcohol</h3>
      <p>Holiday parties usually mean an increase in alcohol consumption. It may seem counterintuitive to actually drink less during the holidays. If you don’t want people at a holiday party asking you why you aren’t drinking (which is rude to ask anyway) have a glass of seltzer water with a lime. Or you can just tell people you aren’t drinking. Or change the topic, because again, it’s really rude to ask someone why they aren’t drinking. Keep in mind that some medications, including antidepressants, can have interactions with alcohol. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5842058/">Alcohol can change how your body metabolizes your medication</a>. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/metaanalysis-of-acute-use-of-alcohol-and-the-risk-of-suicide-attempt/E55CA1B9BF55887403D930FB194924EA">Most important, drinking increases your risk of suicide.</a></p>
      <h3>Mind Your Sleep</h3>
      <p>When people aren’t feeling well, they tend to drift towards hypersomnia, sleeping too much, or insomnia, sleeping too little. Either can cause cognitive difficulties, on top of the cognitive difficulties you may be experiencing due to feelings of sadness or depression. This is the time to beef up your good sleep habits. Keep the same wake and sleep time, even on the weekends. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/40/9/zsx118/3926582">Avoid long naps, as they can throw off your sleep schedule.</a> And naps can’t compensate for a lack of sleep the night before. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165331&amp;mc_cid=4ab3f611c6&amp;mc_eid=84d8381d2c">Shut off electronics at least an hour before bed. </a>If you are practicing good sleep habits and still are having hypersomnia or insomnia, see your doctor for additional help, such as medication, therapy, or a sleep study.</p>
      <h3>Volunteer</h3>
      <p>When you aren’t feeling well, including having emotional and chronic physical pain, volunteering can help you feel better. Having a sense of purpose through altruistic acts can change perceived pain levels. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1524904217303156">One study found that volunteering accounts for 9 percent of the relationship between chronic pain and depression. </a>There is also a beneficial effect of getting out and moving around — and volunteering helps you do that. Additionally, having a structured activity, one where you are expected to appear, helps stave off the inertia that so frequently comes with sadness, anxiety, and depression.</p>
      <p>The most important thing is taking very good care of yourself during the holidays. Be extra gentle to yourself, and let yourself make mistakes without beating yourself up about it. Perfectionistic behaviors are one of the things that drag people down during the holidays. You are an infallible person — embrace that.</p>
