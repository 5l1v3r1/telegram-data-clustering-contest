      <p>CICERO – Call it the heart of a champion. Refuse to lose mentality. Anger. Maybe the Wolfpack simply woke up.</p>
      <p>Whatever.</p>
      <p>Clymer/Sherman/Panama went from trailing by two touchdowns, being pushed around and committing drive-killing mistakes to seizing a spot in the New York State Public High Schools Athletic Association Class D championship football game.</p>
      <p>CSP rallied to defeat Tioga, 28-27, in a clash between the top two-ranked teams in the state. The second-ranked Wolfpack took the lead for good early in the fourth quarter as John Swabik ran in a 2-point conversion out of the wildcat formation after Brandon Ramsey scored on a sensational 43-yard catch and run with 9 minutes, 19 seconds left.</p>
      <p>CSP forced a punt and later snuffed out Tioga's final possession when Connor Cooper picked off a pass with roughly 1:20 left to seal the comeback triumph over the previously undefeated Tigers (11-1).</p>
      <p>The defending state champion Wolfpack (10-1) play for their second straight state title at noon Nov. 29 at the Carrier Dome when they meet Section VII champion Moriah. The Vikings crushed I-Tuckahoe, 46-12, in Friday’s other state semifinal.</p>
      <p>“In the first half I didn’t really know if it was going to happen,” said Swabik, who rushed 19 times for 169 yards and caught a pass for 11 yards, of reaching the state final. “It just feels great to have another chance to get a state title.”</p>
      <p>It should -- considering CSP looked as if it had just 24 minutes left in its season.</p>
      <p>That changed as the Wolfpack played angry and with an edge in beating Tioga for the second straight season in the state semifinals before a crowd of more than 1,000 at Cicero-North Syracuse High School.</p>
      <p>They made a few adjustments defensively –notably moving Cam Barmore from defensive end to the inside along with inserting banged up tackle and co-captain Lucas Rater on the line. Most importantly, they played tougher and it showed as after yielding 291 yards in the first half, the ‘Pack limited the Section IV champion to just 70 yards the rest of the way.</p>
      <p>Sophomore running back Emmett Wood -- a 2,000-yard rusher -- finished with 214 and three touchdowns on 32 carries for Tioga. But he amassed his scores and 172 of those yards during a 19-carry first half.</p>
      <p>“We went into the locker room and coach kind of gave us a wake-up call,” Swabik said. “He just said we needed to step it up because we were getting the ball pounded down our throats. We needed to play gap sound. So we just came out and attacked.”</p>
      <p>CSP also did a better job of being productive on drives after leaving points on the field during the first half (two turnovers on downs in the red zone). The ‘Pack finished with 408 total yards, including 233 on the ground.</p>
      <p>Momentum started to turn in the Wolfpack’s favor during the first series of the second half as they forced Tioga to punt after five plays. That wound up being a sign of things to come as the high-scoring Tigers struggled to move the ball and turned it over twice the rest of the way.</p>
      <p>“It was huge to come out and get a stop on defense that first possession,” said senior quarterback Hinsdale, who passed for 175 yards and three touchdowns. “This team is very tough, and the toughness showed tonight.”</p>
      <p>That included the unheralded Ramsey. In addition to thwarting a fourth-down play at midfield by speeding into the backfield and tackling Wood for a loss, the fullback scored on an 8-yard run with 6:01 left in the third to ignite the comeback.</p>
      <p>He saved his best for the fourth quarter when he slipped behind the defense and caught a long pass from Hinsdale. While three defenders seemingly tracked him down and had him corralled, he weaved through them like they were cones on a field for the 43-yard TD, giving his team a chance at taking the lead by going for two instead of the game-tying extra-point kick. Enter Swabik.</p>
      <p>“As soon as we scored, we knew we were going for two,” winning coach Ty Harper said. “That’s a play we’ve been working on a little bit with John at quarterback. Credit Ramsey who was unbelievable all night and led the way for him (at fullback).”</p>
      <p>Cooper, who had a 36-yard catch that led to Ramsey’s first touchdown, had a chance to make a drive-extending-fourth-down catch deep in Tioga territory on CSP’s next possession. However, the well-thrown ball from Hinsdale slipped through his hands. That almost summed up Cooper’s day as he had a tough one. But like his teammates, Cooper (four carries, two yards) found a way to get off the mat and make a big play when it mattered when he picked off Brady Worthing at the end.</p>
      <p>“To catch that interception to seal it felt great,” Cooper said.</p>
      <p>“That interception was absolutely huge,” Swabik said. “That was the difference in the game because it was only one point. Anything could happen. Con sealed it.”</p>
      <p>Barmore finished with three catches for 47 yards and touchdowns of 6 and 26 yards. Both of the scores came during Tioga’s 27-13 first half – a stretch in which the Tigers executed an onside kick and seemed to be able to do whatever it wanted.</p>
      <p>Until CSP started fighting back.</p>
      <p>“We don’t win this game tonight without Brendon Ramsey,” Harper said. “And Connor Cooper I’m really proud of him with how he handled adversity. Put the ball on the ground a couple times, made a big interception at the end of the game. That’s what our guys have really come to be as guys who handle adversity and persevere and battle through it.”</p>
      <p>“This was our goal,” Hinsdale said. “We expected to be here, and we’re excited to get back (to the championship game).”</p>
