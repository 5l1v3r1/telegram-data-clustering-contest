        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Forty-five percent of self-identified independent voters said in a survey conducted this week by Emerson College that they’re against impeachment of this president — and that’s after a Marquette University poll a conducted couple days earlier found 53 percent of Wisconsin voters want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> to stay.</p>
      <p>The takeaway? Voters are tired of impeachment. They’re sending the message, loud and clear: It’s time to heal.</p>
      <p>It’s time to move on, to bridge the great national divide.</p>
      <p>“November National Poll: Support for Impeachment Declines,” Emerson Polling’s headline blared.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s approval rating over the past weeks jumped to 48%; that’s up from last month’s 43% in the same Emerson survey.</p>
      <hr/>
      <hr/>
      <p>Meanwhile: “Support for impeachment has flipped since October from 48% support with 44% opposing to now 45% opposed and 43% in support,” Emerson <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/november-national-poll-support-for-impeachment-declines-biden-and-sanders-lead-democratic-primary">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Marquette University Law School’s survey, conducted November 13 through November 17, found an even greater opposition to impeachment.</p>
      <p>“Forty percent of registered voters think that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> should be impeached and removed from office, while 53 percent do not think so and 6 percent say that they do not know,” Marquette <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/">wrote</a>. And most significant about this poll is this: “[A] plurality of independents opposed.” By the numbers: 81% of Democrats want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> impeached and removed versus 4% Republicans; 36% of independents want <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a> impeached and removed, compared to 47% of independents who do not.</p>
      <p>That’s a large shift of independent-minded opinion.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>And given as it comes amid wall-to-wall House Intelligence Committee televised hearings on impeachment, it’s a shift that shouldn’t be discounted. If Democrats were banking on boosting their ballots based on impeach, impeach, impeach — they might have a problem.</p>
        <p>Gallup, in October, found 39% of voters consider themselves independents, versus Republican or Democrat. Pew Research Center, in May, put that statistic at 38%.</p>
        <p>But here’s the interesting part: Pew <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/15/facts-about-us-political-independents/">said</a> of that 38%, only 7% didn’t lean toward either of the two main political parties. Of the remaining, 13% leaned Republican — and 17%, Democrat.</p>
        <p>So that means the largest share of independents lean Democrat.</p>
        <p>So that means the largest share of independents voicing opposition to impeachment and removal of this president are actually Democrat voters.</p>
        <p>So that means: Adam Schiff is overplaying his hand. Nancy Pelosi is making a strategic political mistake. Democrats are overstaying their impeachment welcome. The left has gone too far left with its quest for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/donald-trump/">Trump</a>’s head.</p>
        <p>After three years of impeachment calls, after witness after witness after witness of impeachment inquiry testimony, the country’s ready for healing — hungry for healing. And by country, that means Republicans and yes, many Democrats, alike.</p>
