      <p>The Amansie South District in the Ashanti Region can now boast of a District Police Command following the construction of a modern police headquarters at Manso-Adubia, the district capital.</p>
      <p>The project which was initiated by the Adubia Traditional Council in 2016 was completed by the assembly after it stalled at some point due to inadequate funding, paving the way for the elevation of the Adubia Police Station to a district headquarters.</p>
      <p>Hitherto, the Adubia Police Station was under the Amansie West District Command despite Amansie South becoming a district on its own in 2015.</p>
      <p>The Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Mr James Oppong Boanuh at a colourful ceremony to commission the building, praised the District Chief Executive (DCE), Mr William Asante Bediako for his instrumental role in the construction of the edifice.</p>
      <p>He said the partnership between the assembly and the traditional council towards the project demonstrated their collective commitment to ensure the safety of the people.</p>
      <p>He assured them that the police administration would reciprocate their gesture by providing the requisite personnel and logistics to protect lives and properties in the district.</p>
      <p>The IGP urged the people to cooperate with police personnel in the district to enable them to discharge their duties efficiently for the mutual benefit of both parties.</p>
      <p>Mr Simon Osei Mensah, the Ashanti Regional Minister hailed the traditional council and the assembly for the laudable initiative.</p>
      <p>He said the decision to embark on the project was not only visionary but also impactful, adding that, it would benefit even generations yet unborn.</p>
      <p>He was hopeful that the command would to take urgent steps to address the numerous security challenges confronting the people in the district.</p>
      <p>The DCE, William Asante Bediako said because of the booming mining activities in the district, residents and commuters had been terrorized by armed robbers for far too long hence the need to step up security in the district.</p>
      <p>He said the project was the first he and the assembly tackled when he assumed office as DCE due to the myriad security challenges in the district.</p>
      <p>The assembly, he noted, would continue to collaborate with relevant authorities to beef up security in the district to promote economic activities.</p>
