      <h1>Publicity, exposure of Queen’s College pupil uncalled for –Ahmed, PTA chairman</h1>

      <p>During this week, a parent of a pupil of Queen’s College, Lagos, and the security team of the school were involved in a brawl over after she was denied entry into the school for wearing artificial eyelashes and nail polish. Chairman of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association, Abbas Ahmed tells LAWRENCE MIKE about the update and the position of the association</p>

        <b>
          <i>What do you think about the recent brawl between a parent of a pupil of Queen’s College, Lagos and security guards in the school?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>To be candid with you, investigations are ongoing to determine exactly what happened on that day. We are trying to look at all the perspectives and the evidence of the eye witnesses. Once the investigation is concluded, we intend to have a press briefing, where we will inform the public about what happened and the decision of the school.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>It was said that the pupil in question broke some school rules, has that been established?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. From the video clips available, the whole episode emanated from the fact that Queen’s College, being a disciplined institution, was actually trying to enforce its rules and regulations. That is why I said investigation is ongoing as to what exactly happened on that day but the whole issue surrounds the enforcement of laid down rules and regulations by an institution that cherishes discipline.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Who recorded and posted the video of the incident? Was it the school authority?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Absolutely no! It wasn’t the school authority. The school authority could not have posted any video. That’s why investigation is currently ongoing to know what happened, who did what, and the way forward.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>For pupils who run afoul of school regulations, what forms of punishment should be meted out to them?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>No. If you attended any public school, you would realise that there are various ways of penalising or punishing pupils. It could be by giving them an area of land in the school to weed. Some schools have chores like washing of corridors and toilets. It’s not about sending pupils home. It’s just about knowing that there are always penalties for violating school rules.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Were the security guards acting on the instructions of the school when they decided to send the pupil home?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I do not have the facts; that’s why I am saying investigation is ongoing to know whether she was sent home or wasn’t sent home. I wasn’t there but the school is conducting an investigation to know what happened on that day and as soon as it is done, the press will be adequately briefed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How does the school intend to manage the situation once the investigations are completed?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The school is a self-regulated institution and if anybody is found wanting, whether the person is a pupil, parent or staff member, the school has laid down procedures for dealing with such issues and I know that Queen’s College as a proactive institution will deal with the situation appropriately.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How have other parents reacted to the situation?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As parents, we have empathy for the plight of the pupil involved because the exposure and publicity were unwarranted and could have been prevented. And on the other hand, parents were a little bit worried as to what actually warranted a pupil to dress in that manner to school in company with her parent. So they are also awaiting the outcome of the investigation to know what really happened because as journalists, you should hear from both sides before arriving at a conclusion.</p>
      <p>You should not just arrive at a conclusion after hearing from one party. So parents are also waiting and as the chairman of the PTA, I can tell you that we waiting for the outcome of the investigation by the school management.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>How did the school handle a similar case in the past?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>To my knowledge as the PTA chairman, I’m not privy to any similar incident that has occurred in the past.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>For some time, Queen’s College has been having issues as regards health and hygiene. Some students lost their lives to diarrhoea some years ago and this year there was an outbreak of flu. What role is the PTA playing to ensure that it doesn’t happen again?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Let me set the records straight. In the past one year, the story of flu that was in the media was blown out of proportion. Those who blew it out of proportion knew the reason why they did that. Yes, there were cases of flu. Even my daughter had flu when she got to school one week after resumption. The normal procedure is that you will be called from the sick bay and informed that your daughter has flu. You will be asked to take her home. And we took her home, treated her and she returned to school.</p>
      <p>You know, it was during the rainy season so there was flu everywhere. And the number of pupils affected in a school with a population of about 4,000 pupils, were about 100. And it was not on one day; probably within a period of one week. The story that was woven around the flu incident was politically motivated. They were mischievous, frivolous and had a sinister motive. It was targeted at achieving a sinister motive.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Education visited the school and passed a vote of confidence on the health system. The school’s old girls’ association visited the school because the story in the media was that there was an epidemic. The old girls visited the school and observed that there was no epidemic. They went to the sick bay and saw that it was attending to pupils normally. Following the incident, the school has introduced a new development. After resumption of pupils to school after vacation, their temperatures will be taken. Records of their medical state will be received as they return to school to ensure that as at the time they are coming to school, they are in a good state of health.</p>
      <p>And even for parents, for example, if your child is on medication, they should allow her to complete her medication at home before bringing her to school. Or if a day before resumption, your daughter is complaining of pain or one ailment or the other, please don’t dump her in school. Treat her before coming to avoid the stress of dropping your daughter off in school and being called later to take her home. All these measures have been put in place to ensure that we do not have any ugly incident.</p>

        <b>
          <i>Have the parents of the pupil in question been contacted by the PTA?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>They are in the process of contacting them. Like I told you, there are some things that may not be for public consumption now because investigation is ongoing.</p>
