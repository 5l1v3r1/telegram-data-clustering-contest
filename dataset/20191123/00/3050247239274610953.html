      <h1>Overstock’s Former CEO Patrick Byrne Still Holds Major tZero Stake</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:33:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:33</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>After selling off all of his Overstock shares, former CEO Patrick Byrne is reportedly still holding a major stake in tZero, Overstock’s crypto token platform.</p>
      <h3>Byrne still owns 63,775 shares in tZero</h3>
      <p>Overstock’s 2019 notice of special meeting and proxy statement, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1130713/000119312519298633/d838715dpre14a.htm">filed</a> with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-sec-takes-another-look-at-rejected-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-proposal">SEC</a>) on Nov. 22, shows that the company's former CEO still holds 63,775 shares of series a-1 preferred stock.</p>
      <p>In August, Byrne <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-advocate-patrick-byrne-resigns-as-ceo-of-overstock">announced</a> that he was stepping down as CEO of Overstock, citing his controversial relationship with Maria Butina as the most important reason for cutting ties with Overstock.</p>
      <p>Butina, alleged to be a Russian agent, is currently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/business/overstock-paul-byrne-maria-butina-affair.html">serving</a> 18 months behind bars for having infiltrated powerful political circles in the United States at the direction of the Russian government.</p>
      <h3>Byrne’s cashout</h3>
      <p>In September, Byrne <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-overstock-ceo-sells-his-entire-13-stake-in-the-firm-for-90m">cashed</a> out nearly 4.8 million Overstock (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=OSTK">OSTK</a>) shares, which accounted for more than 13% of the company and was worth around $90 million at the time. According to a<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1130713/000117911019010461/xslF345X03/edgar.xml"> filing</a> with the U.S SEC, the former CEO had sold his shares at lower and lower prices ranging from $21.84 on Sept. 16 to $16.32 on Sept. 18.</p>
      <p>In the same month, a class action <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/class-action-complaint-filed-against-patrick-byrne-and-overstockcom">complaint</a> was filed in Utah that accuses Overstock.com, Byrne and former CFO Greg Iverson of securities fraud. The complaint alleged that Byrne designed Overstock.com’s digital asset-based dividend as a means of punishing short sellers. The complaint stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“While defendant Byrne had previously, at different times, launched into public tirades over short selling and naked short selling, the tZERO Dividend was his secret plot to finally obtain hegemony over them — and it almost worked.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Overstock opens blockchain R&amp;D center in Ireland</h3>
      <p>Despite the fact that Overstock finds itself in the midst of controversy, at the beginning of October, the e-commerce giant <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/e-commerce-giant-overstock-opens-blockchain-rd-center-in-ireland">announced</a> that it had opened a blockchain research and development (R&amp;D) center in Ireland. The firm’s R&amp;D center is located in “IDA’s flagship North West business park in Sligo” where it hopes to make its 100th Irish hire before the end of 2019.</p>
