      <p>The final week of byes! Congratulations to those that have powered through. For those that are still battling, stay strong, there’s just one week to go and I’m here to help. On Wednesday I spoke about some <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zachpetersel/2019/11/15/fantasy-football-week-11-wide-receiver-sleepers-2-star-wrs-to-avoid/#67d8d0424d60">running back sleepers to target</a> and like with the RBs, there are some huge WRs out this week. Keenan Allen, Tyreek Hill, Stefon Diggs, among others.</p>
      <p>However, as I’ve made note of every week, there are some nice value for us to capitalize on within <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/rankings/half-point-ppr-wr.php">FantasyPros’ half-PPR rankings</a>. In addition, I’ll talk about a WR1 that I’m fading this week. If your league has unique rules or you’re just looking for more help, their <a href="https://www.fantasypros.com/nfl/myplaybook/football-start-sit-assistant.php?partner=petersel">Start/Sit Assistant</a> is a great tool as well.</p>
      <p>For now, let’s try to strike while the oven is hot after Randall Cobb (four catches, 115 yards and a touchdown) came through for us last week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Jacksonville Jaguars WR Chris Conley (FantasyPros Rank, 45. Yahoo Ownership, 14%)</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m not quite sure what it will take for Conley’s ownership to jump. Over his last four games, Conley is averaging seven-plus targets a game, 69 receiving yards and found the end zone once. He’s on the field all the time, <a href="https://twitter.com/rotounderworld/status/1196459677560836096">playing every snap last week</a>, a trend we saw dating back to the preseason with a healthy Nick Foles.</p>
      <p>As noted by <a href="https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/29368/daily-fantasy-football-sannes-situations-to-monitor-in-week-12">Jim Sannes of NumberFire</a>, the Titans have been burned by speed this year. John Brown, Tyreek Hill and DJ Chark have had at least 75 yards receiving against Tennessee. Enter Chris Conley and his elite 4.35 40-yard dash time, and we have one of the best matchups of the week.</p>
      <p>What gives me pause are the pace-of-play and over/under. The Jags-Titans matchup is the <a href="https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1197506608647028736">worst on the slate</a> in terms of projected plays run. Both teams play slow, and while it may sound obvious, we want to invest in teams that run more plays because it gives our players more chances to earn fantasy points. The <a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/las-vegas/?s=516">41.5-point over/under</a> could be worse, but there are only four other games with lower-projected scoring totals, so it’s a risky number to invest in.</p>
      <p>But I’m still investing.</p>
      <p>Chris Conley ranks 29th in the league in <a href="http://airyards.com/tables.html">air yards</a> this season, and he’s been <a href="https://twitter.com/HaydenWinks/status/1196539469165453313">one of the most consistent</a> players in that regard all year. When considering players with 30-plus targets, Conley’s average depth of target (aDOT) is 14th-best in the league. The Titans rank 22nd against the pass this season, <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2019">according to Football Outsiders</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s more of a dart-throw than I typically like with my first WR suggestion, but the talent is there, the consistent volume is there and the underlying stats suggest a potential breakout could happen as well.</p>
      <p>Conley is a sneaky WR3 this week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. New York Giants WR Sterling Shepard (FantasyPros Rank, 62. Yahoo Ownership, 50%)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sterling Shepard hasn’t played since Week 5 but after getting in a few full practices this week he’s been cleared to play Sunday against the Bears.</p>
      <p>The good news, Shepard was a target monster when he played earlier this season. At least seven targets in each game, with nine in each of his last three. He averaged around 78 total yards per game, finding the end zone once. While much of his production came while Golden Tate was suspended, Tate was active in Shepard’s last game and Sterling still received nine targets, but it also came when Evan Engram was active. He’s been ruled out of Sunday’s affair, so there should be plenty of targets to go around.</p>
      <p>We also don’t have to worry about QB-WR chemistry.</p>
      <p>In the three games Shepard played with Daniel Jones, he averaged a 26.9% target share, with seven of those targets coming 16 yards downfield, according to <a href="https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/news/29368/daily-fantasy-football-sannes-situations-to-monitor-in-week-12">Jim Sannes of NumberFire</a>, so there’s some big play potential. Jones has thrown at least 35 passes in 6-of-8 starts this season, so with Engram out, the volume should still be there for Shepard.</p>
      <p>While the talent and opportunity we always look for is there in spades, the matchup is what pushes Shepard down the ranks.</p>
      <p>The Bears have the fourth-best defense in the league, <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/teamdef/2019">according to Football Outsiders</a>, ranked sixth against the pass and 12th against the run. The Giants have the <a href="https://twitter.com/NickMensio/status/1197659488955686912">second-lowest projected team point total</a> of the week. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Ihartitz/status/1197506608647028736">combined pace-of-play</a> between the two teams is slightly above-average, but not exactly encouraging. Not to mention the Bears have been stingy this season against wide receivers.</p>
      <p>This low in the rankings, I’m betting Shepard’s talent and volume in this offense can overcome the negative trends his situation presents. Regardless, he’s only owned in 50% of Yahoo leagues. If for whatever reason he’s available in yours, add him immediately. If not for the matchup this week, but for his Week 15-16 playoff schedule of the Dolphins and Redskins.</p>
      <p>By then, he may have WR1 potential.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WR to Fade: Dallas Cowboys WR Amari Cooper (FantasyPros Rank, 14)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Patriots simply don’t allow opposing quarterbacks or wide receivers to do well. One of the big reasons for that, is Stephon Gilmore. Having the best corner in football certainly helps...unless you own Amari Cooper and need a fantasy win.</p>
      <p>Amari is banged up. Dallas has one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/NickMensio/status/1197659488955686912">lower-projected point totals</a> of the week. It’s hard to fathom even thinking these words, forget typing them, but I’m heavily considering benching Amari for DeVante Parker, ranked 23rd this week (he’s been sneaky good for a long time in 2019.) I’d definitely bench him for Jamison Crowder, who’s ranked 21st, would also take a long look at Marvin Jones down at number 30 on the rankings.</p>
      <p>It’s nearly impossible to bench someone with as much talent as Amari Cooper. I’m just saying, if there ever was a week where you have roster depth to consider it, this is it.</p>
