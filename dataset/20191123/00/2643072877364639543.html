      <p>Governor Bello Matawalle of <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/20/zamfara-state-cp-condemns-fulani-leaders-over-peace-accord/"><u><b>Zamfara State</b></u></a> has said he could order the arrest of his predecessor Abdulaziz Yari if killings continue in his state.</p>
      <p>The governor made the accusation at government house, Gusau, while receiving some firearms that some “repentant bandits” surrendered, the Punch reports.</p>
      <p>Matawalle reportedly blamed recent attacks on Yari, saying the former governor is inciting violence in the state.</p>
      <p>The governor said attacks occur in Zamfara State whenever Abdulaziz Yari visits the state.</p>
      <p>According to Matawalle, <i>“I have decided to take this action against the former governor because I observed that whenever he visited the state, there would be attacks and killing of innocent people immediately he left.”</i></p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that fourteen persons were killed last Sunday in an attack on Karaye village in Gummi local government area.</p>
      <p>The attack is the first major breach of the peace agreement between the state government and suspected bandits.</p>
      <p>“Security is the responsibility of all and I wonder why some people such as the former governor and his followers are not happy with the current development in which the security of the state has significantly improved,” Governor Matawalle added.</p>
      <p>He urged charged security operatives to arrest and prosecute anybody found to be responsible for the killings.</p>
