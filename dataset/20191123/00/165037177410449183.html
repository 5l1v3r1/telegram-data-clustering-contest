        <b>Arturo Vidal came off the bench for Barca to secure a 2-1 win away to Leganés, however, they will have to improve if they have any title aspirations.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barca </a>started the match with<b> 4 attackers</b>, in a lineup that included <b>Messi, Griezmann, Suárez and Dembélé</b>. They were far from the better side as in the 12th minute the hosts opened the scoring.</p>
      <p><b>En-Nesyri fired home a stunner</b> in the top corner from outside the box that Ter Stegen could only watch fly past him. For the 3rd league match in a row, Barca failed to keep a clean sheet. Leganés almost doubled their lead 4 minutes later when <b>Óscar had a shot that was drilled into the side netting</b>. Suárez then had a few shots that were saved well by Cuéllar in the Leganés goal as the hosts went in at the break deservedly in front.</p>
      <p><b>Barca came out after the break all guns blazing</b>. A couple of minutes after the interval,<b> Piqué</b>'s header crashed off the post, but Barca were rewarded for their efforts shortly after. <b>Messi swung in the corner and Suárez rose above everyone to head it home</b>. Questions may be asked about whether Cuéllar could have saved it, but Suárez wasn't caring as he netted his 7th league goal of the season.</p>

      <p>Barca then brought on <b>Vidal for Griezmann </b>and the substitution paid off. 11 minutes from time <b>Dembélé crossed in the corner</b>. It hit the Leganés player and fell to <b>Vidal at the post who tapped in</b>. The Chilean was miles offside but after VAR checked that the Leganés player touched it last, the goal stood and Barca held on to cement their place at the top of the league.</p>
      <p>They have two crucial matches coming up: firstly at home to <b>Dortmund</b> in the Champions League and then away to <b>Atlético Madrid</b> next Sunday.</p>
