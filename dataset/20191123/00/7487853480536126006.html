      <h1>Watford 0-3 Burnley: Reports, Ratings and Reaction as Clarets Win Sees Hornets Remain in Drop Zone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15213495" target="_blank">Matt O'Connor-Simpson</a></address>
      <p>Watford remained in the Premier League relegation places, after falling to their seventh defeat of the season against a well-drilled Burnley side.</p>
      <p>Burnley looked to impose themselves early on with some typically strong challenges, although it would be the home side who carved out the first chance of the game, with Gerard Deulofeu's drilled shot being well saved by Nick Pope 17 minutes in.  ​</p>
      <p><a href="http://90min.com/teams/watford">​Watford</a> had the main share of the possession in the first half but often struggled to convert this dominance into scoring chances. Etienne Capoue had a pot shot 37 minutes but the best effort of the half again came courtesy of Deulofeu, who forced a save out of Pope from a free kick. </p>
      <p>Against the run of play it was actually <a href="http://90min.com/teams/burnley">​Burnley</a> who would open the lead early in the second half. From a corner, Chris Wood latched onto the end of a loose ball and fired home to put the Clarets 1-0 up. </p>
      <p>The visitors came close to doubling their lead just after the hour mark, with Jeff Hendrick's quick feet creating space for the Irishman to fire off a shot that was well saved by Ben Foster. </p>

      <p>The game was put beyond all doubt eight minutes from time when VAR awarded Burnley a penalty which Ashley Barnes managed to just squeeze past Foster in the Watford goal.</p>
      <p>James Tarkowski added some undeserved gloss to the scoreline in the 87th minute to make it 3-0.</p>

      <h3>Watford</h3>
      <h4>Talking Point</h4>
      <p>Watford went into the game having won just once all season and thus unsurprisingly were low on confidence. </p>
      <p>This showed in their attacking efforts in the opening 30 minutes, with the Hornet's wing-backs, José Holebas and Kiko, content to sit deep to create a back five as opposed to supporting their more advanced teammates. </p>

      <p>As Burnley allowed them more into the game however, Watford began to gain an offensive foothold and had a real spell of pressure just before half time. </p>
      <p>This brief period of attacking threat was the exception to the rule for the home side this afternoon though, with the Hornets front line generally lacking the creativity to break down a stubborn Burnley defence.</p>

      <p>There was a lack of standout performers for Watford but the cream of a fairly meagre crop was Abdoulaye Doucoure.</p>
      <p>His driving runs were at the centre of his team's attacking threat all afternoon while he also ensured that the home side dominate the midfield with some intelligent positioning. </p>
      <p>Watford will be concerned that if results do not improve, the Frenchman may seek to ply his trade elsewhere. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Burnley </h3>
      <h4>Talking Point</h4>
      <p>If Sean Dyche was a Premier League result, there's a pretty good chance he would be a win against Watford away from home. This was a Dyche masterclass. </p>
      <p>His side were under the cosh for much of the first half but thanks to some resolute defending, never really looked like conceding. </p>

      <p>Once they grabbed their goal they protected it at all costs, before they added two more against the run of play. </p>
      <p>There was time wasting and tactical fouls a-plenty as Burnley used the footballing dark arts to secure their fifth win of the season. </p>

      <p>​In a week where he received a rare England cap, Nick Pope again had reason to celebrate this afternoon as he put in a solid performance that kept his side in it in the first half. </p>
      <p>With Burnley under the cosh, Pope made two fantastic saves from Deulofeu including one from a very well struck free kick. </p>
      <p>His second half display was also impressive. Though not called upon to make that many saves, the 27-year-old dealt with everything that came his way with minimal fuss, calmly steering his team towards victory. </p>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>​</p>
      <p>Next up Watford face fellow strugglers <a href="http://90min.com/teams/southampton">​Southampton</a> on 30 November, in a game that could go a way to deciding the outcome of the Premier League relegation battle. ​</p>
      <p>Burnley on the other hand host Crystal Palace as they continue to try and keep themselves clear of the drop zone. </p>
