      <h1>Finally, hot mix plant to start operations</h1>

      <p>As a measure for a quick fix bad stretches of roads and potholes across the city, a hot mix plant has been set up. Earlier, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) were dependent on contractors for the hot mix to lay the roads and fix the potholes which raised several concerns about adultered or low quality material being used. Citizens have also often complained about the low quality work that caves in, after the first showers of rain and affects the traffic in city. <br/><br/>The hot mix plant in Kannur was recently inaugurated by Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa. The hot mix plant will start its operations next week. The plant with the capacity of 100/120 TPH (Tonne Per Hour) would be run by MSV (M S Venkatesh), the agency that had set up the plant. However, the plant will be monitored by the Traffic Engineering Cell (TEC) of BBMP. A BBMP official said, “Whenever we need to asphalt for any kind of road work or to fix potholes, we will purchase the required quantity of the mix from the plant.” <br/><br/>The plant has been set up on a 3-acre land in Kannur at a cost of about Rs 3.5 crore. The agency will be setting up another plant of same capacity at Bandepalya. <br/>The BBMP is also trying to fix the potholes on immediate basis. Earlier, the civic authority had set a self assigned deadline of November 10 and they claim they have fixed over 10,000 potholes off the 10,646 potholes that they had identified in the city. The official says it would take approximately 24 cubic metre of mix to fix a 100 metre of a bad stretch of road. For potholes, the quantity of the material would vary as per the size of the potholes.</p>
