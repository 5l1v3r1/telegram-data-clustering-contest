      <p>LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) - Xazavian Valladay ran 27 times for 154 yards to help Wyoming beat Colorado State 17-7 on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Cooper Rothe’s 48-yard field goal capped a drive that took nearly six minutes and made it a two-possession lead for the Cowboys (7-4, 4-3) with 3:33 left in the fourth quarter. Two plays later, Wyoming’s Logan Wilson intercepted Patrick O’Brien’s pass and the Cowboys ran out the clock with a pair of first downs.</p>
      <p>Tyler Vander Waal opened the scoring for Wyoming with a 1-yard sneak on a third-and-goal.</p>
      <p>The Rams (4-7, 3-4) immediately answered with a 13-play, 75-yard drive capped by O’Brien’s 4-yard TD pass to Warren Jackson.</p>
      <p>Vander Waal was injured after a low tackle and left the game in the third quarter but returned in the fourth.</p>
