      <h1>GolfNow’s Merger With TeeOff Makes Waves In Golf’s Online Tee Time Market</h1>

      <p>GolfNow was already the biggest online tee time agency in the golf industry. Now it’s seized an even bigger share of the market.In a move with major ramifications throughout the golf world, NBC Sports Group acquired EZLinks Golf, including its technology platforms, business solutions and, perhaps most significantly, its prominent online tee time booking platform TeeOff. NBC Sports Group in essence bought the PGA TOUR’s share in EZLinks, an affiliate investment the tour entered in 2015.</p>
      <p>Now, the PGA TOUR is out of the online tee time marketplace. Meanwhile, the merger of GolfNow and TeeOff – the two biggest third-party booking engines in the game – gives NBC Sports Group control of a vast majority of the online tee time inventory. Jay Karen, the CEO of the National Golf Course Owners Association, suggests some estimates put it over 90% of the market share.  </p>
      <p>“Our strategy is to make golf more accessible, simpler and more enjoyable to play by using tech and services that help better connect golfers and golf courses,” said Jeff Foster, senior vice president, GolfNow and Emerging Businesses. </p>
      <p>GolfNow has been affiliated with more than 7,000 golf courses worldwide, 65% of which are in the United States, and has approximately 3.5 million worldwide users that booked around 17 million rounds of golf. TeeOff, which had been the official tee time site of the PGA TOUR, offers tee times at more than 3,000 U.S. courses (including some overlap with facilities GolfNow is already affiliated with).</p>
      <p>Will McIntosh, executive vice president of NBC Sports’ Digital and Consumer business, says incorporating the technology and services of EZLinks into comprehensive digital solutions like GolfNow, GOLF Business Solutions and GolfPass enhances NBC Sports Group’s ability to “help golf courses operate more efficiently and make the game more accessible for golfers.”</p>

      <p>Karen, the head of the NGCOA, says he senses the merger of GolfNow and TeeOff will be indeed be a “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/response-merger-golfnow-ezlinks-jay-karen/?published=t">big benefit</a>” to the golfer, but believes that the economic model that’s made them successful – bartering tee times in exchange for technology and marketing services — has weakened the average golf course.</p>
      <p>“This merger of two of the largest brands in golf may result in more light shining on our great game, and more choice, on one screen, for the golfer,” Karen <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/response-merger-golfnow-ezlinks-jay-karen/?published=t"><b>wrote in a response t</b></a>o the acquisition. “It also may result in greater investments in their respective technology, used by thousands of golf courses. Yet I am not convinced it will aid the financial success of golf courses. My concern is the merger consolidates inventory and power to sell more heavily discounted and bartered golf.”</p>
      <p>Karen said he looks forward to more direct dialogue with executives of the online tee time agencies and added that the NGCOA continues to encourage course operators to engage in partnerships with software companies and tee time marketers when they’re “clearly and indisputably advantageous to your business.” </p>
      <p>GolfNow has been a significant revenue stream for NBC Sports Group, yet the number of bookings it took last year was just a small percentage of the 434 million rounds played throughout the U.S. in 2018. Even if all 17 million of its bookings <i>had been</i> in the U.S., for a hypothetical average of 2.5 golfers, that would account for less than 10% of the total rounds played, and the addition of TeeOff wouldn’t drive it drastically higher. The majority of bookings are still done by consumers directly through golf facilities themselves, either in the pro shop, on the phone or through a course’s own online booking platform.</p>
      <p>“While golfers will continue to have plenty of choices in how they book tee times, the combination will also provide them with more access and options,” said NBC Sports’ McIntosh. “We value any feedback from the golf course community and will continue to reinvest in the products and services that help courses thrive and enhance the golfing experience.”</p>
      <p>It’s not known how much NBC Sports paid to acquire EZLinks, but the move is also noteworthy given the backdrop of the ongoing PGA TOUR broadcasting rights negotiations. Depending on your point of view, the acquisition could either help NBC Sports and Golf Channel offset the potential loss of the tour’s broadcasting rights, or be part of an unspoken agreement to stay strongly positioned to retain those rights.</p>
      <p>Either way, the merger is a noteworthy one that will have a continuing impact on the golf business going forward.</p>
