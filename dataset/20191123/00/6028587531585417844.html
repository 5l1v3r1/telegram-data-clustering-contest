      <p>Averting their fourth defeat of the season, FC Barcelona came back from a goal behind at bottom-ranked Leganes on Saturday afternoon to stay atop of La Liga. Trailing thanks to a 12th minute top corner rocket from Youssef En-Nesyri, the Blaugrana went down the tunnel at half time with a mountain to climb but reached the summit with reponses from South American duo Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal.</p>
      <p>A second half substitute replacing a poor Antoine Griezmann, the Chilean war horse sealed the points for Barça with a close-range smash into the roof of the net 11 minutes from time and was awarded the King of the Match gong by the official sponsors.</p>
      <p>Alongside him in midfield however, Frenkie de Jong was the most impressive player for FC Barcelona at Butarque.</p>
      <p>Found by Mundo Deportivo to have the ‘most character’ of all his teammates, he played ‘a very complete match in Butarque, despite the bad collective day.’ </p>
      <p>‘Although he was one of the players brought off by Valverde [for Ansu Fati on 70 minutes,’ wrote the sports daily, ‘the Dutchman was one of the most clairvoyant [ie the best reader of the game among the] Barça players on the field.’ </p>
      <p>‘He played in a double pivot with Busquets in a system change introduced by Valverde,’ it was highlighted, ‘[and] recovered balls and played the ball with discretion, seldom accompanied by his colleagues.’</p>
      <p>Exerting unbelievable cool on the ball when closed down and facing his own goal in one instance, De Jong somehow managed to turn away from danger and chip the ball over the back line to set Barça off on a push for an equaliser in the first half.</p>
      <p>When they finally achieved that, eight minutes into the second, he then found Messi moments later and allowed him to have a maiden shot on goal that could have easily been converted had the Argentine received it with a better touch.</p>
      <p>Stastically-speaking, the 22-year-old signed from Ajax in the summer for $83mn completed an oustanding 94% of his 72 attempted passes, the best across the whole outfield team, and indeed began in a two man defensive midfield as part of the 4-2-3-1 decided on by Ernesto Valverde.</p>
      <p>When Busquets was brought off in the 57th minute however as a precaution, Barça switched to their usual 4-3-3 which saw him joining new entrants Ivan Rakitic - the dislodged figure he has forced into seeking a January exit - and Arturo Vidal in a centre-of-the-park trident.</p>
      <p>Already one of the first names on the team sheet in having ran out for 16 of 17 official fixtures from the offset this season, the Netherlands international is set to be more vital than ever on his club’s next La Liga road trip.</p>
      <p>This is because Spain veteran Busquets was yellow-carded today and will now, as a consequence, have to sit out a vital encounter with Atletico Madrid at the Wanda while serving a one-match ban during the showdown with Diego Simeone’s men.</p>
      <p>One of the toughest assignments in their eight games across 29 days heading towards the end of the year, which the Catalan press have dubbed eight ‘finals’, De Jong will look to guide FCB towards overturning an unfavourable statistic that finds them defeated on every occasion (three in total, and all away) that Busquets did not accompany with him.</p>
      <p>Cut three times from the matchday squad as of late, it remains to be seen whether the Brazilian Arthur will be trusted or Valverde will look to the likes of Sergi Roberto, Rakitic (coincidentally linked to a move to the Spanish capital) and Vidal for the task at hand.</p>
