      <p>As <i>It Chapter Two </i>heads into its 12th weekend in theaters, it looks as though the end is near. After opening to a stellar $91.1 million weekend back on Sept. 6-8, this past weekend was barely able to drum up $50,000 from its scattered showings across the U.S.While <i>It Chapter Two </i>has undoubtedly been a huge success for Warner Bros., it hasn’t been able to mimic the record-shattering presence the first film had back in 2017. On opening weekend, <i>It </i>opened to a $123.4 million weekend, which was followed by a $60.1 million weekend. During those two weeks, <i>It </i>played in about 4,100 theaters.</p>
      <p>However, <i>It Chapter Two</i>’s second weekend—which saw 4,570 theaters across the country—only pulled in $39.6 million. That put <i>Chapter Two</i>’s two-week revenue a full $74.4 million behind its predecessor.</p>
      <p>Surprising, <i>It</i>’s run in theaters was short compared to most blockbusters producing nine-figure grosses. Sans inflation, <i>It </i>is easily the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2019/10/03/the-highest-grossing-horror-movies-of-all-time/#78260436e4d3">highest-grossing horror movie</a> of all time. However, the film only spent 14 weeks in theaters. After weekly revenue dipped down to $1.3 million during Week 9, its theater count fells from 1,181 to just 578. After that, its quick exit from theaters before the holiday season became inevitable.</p>
      <p>So with Christmastime approaching once again, we’re seeing the end of <i>It</i>’s sequel as well. <i>Chapter Two </i>also saw a big drop in weekly revenue during Week 9 when it pulled in $249,618. After that, its theater count dropped dramatically from 1,101 to just 126.</p>
      <p>Then this past weekend, <i>Chapter Two </i>was only able to muster $59,361 from 132 theaters. That puts its Weekend 11 gross nearly $100,000 behind the first film.</p>
      <p>At this point, <i>It Chapter Two </i>is just narrowly beating out movies like <i>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood </i>(currently in its 18th week in theaters), <i>The Lion King </i>(in its 19th week in theaters) and <i>Toy Story 4 </i>(in its 23rd week in theaters). So before the barrage of holiday films hits the market, we’ll likely see the much-anticipated sequel to <i>It </i>exit theaters. Considering you can now stream the film on Amazon, that isn’t too much of a surprise.</p>
