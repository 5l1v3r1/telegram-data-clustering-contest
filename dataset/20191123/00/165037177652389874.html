        <b>Harry Kane measures up well to other great strikers coached by Jose Mourinho, who now wants to help him match their medal haul.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho believes<b> Harry Kane is one of the best strikers in the world </b>and wants to take him to the next level by winning titles at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Kane blossomed into an elite performer for club and country under the guidance of Mauricio Pochettino and begins a new chapter at Spurs on Saturday, when Mourinho takes charge of the club for the first time away to West Ham.</p>
      <p>Despite<b> the clear achievement of establishing Tottenham </b>as a Champions League staple during his time in charge, a flimsy stick used to beat Pochettino's achievements was his lack of a major trophy.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, as a league-winner in four different countries, is a specialist in this regard and believes it is something Kane needs to take his career up another gear.</p>
      <p>"He is one of the best strikers<b> in the world</b>, no doubt," he said.</p>
      <p>"He just needs his team with him. If his team is England or Tottenham, he needs this team to go with him <b>to the next level</b>.</p>
      <p>"What is the next level? Titles. With us, with England, he needs to bring something to highlight the quality that he has as a player, the goals he scores, what he brings to the teams.</p>
      <p>"He is a top striker and, you are right, I have worked with some of the top ones."</p>
      <p>Tottenham head into the weekend languishing in 14th position in the Premier League,<b> 20 points </b>away from leaders <b>Liverpool</b>.</p>
      <p>In the long-term, though, Mourinho does not feel ambitions should be limited for Kane and his team-mates.</p>
      <p>"At this moment I think only of<b> West Ham and Olympiacos</b>," he said, referring to Spurs' forthcoming midweek opponents. "Try to win against West Ham and try to qualify for the next round of the Champions League,</p>
      <p>"But with the squad we have, with the quality of the structure of the club, I think we can have the same ambitions as people and clubs potentially bigger than us.</p>

      <p>"I don't want my players to fear everything. We go for everything against everybody."</p>
      <p>The man responsible for putting much of that structure in place is chairman <b>Daniel Levy</b>, whose status as a divisive figure among the Tottenham faithful became a little more entrenched by Mourinho's appointment.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is full of admiration for Levy and his reputation as a tough transfer market operator, remarking it is "mission impossible" for any club wanting to take Kane away from north London.</p>
      <p>"I used to be in clubs that fear him. It's true," he said.</p>
      <p>"<b>He's powerful</b>. He's a business man but he's a football man. He has big experience as part of his intelligence overall.</p>
      <p>"He's a football man. He understands football, he understands the industry, he understands its evolution. It's great to have him on my side."</p>
      <p>Another possible bone of contention as Mourinho looks to establish himself at Tottenham is likely to be their style of play, considering how the 56-year-old's reputation for pragmatism does not exactly mesh with the high-octane approach under Pochettino that came to be much-admired.</p>
      <p>"The fans must be happy, the players must be happy and I must be happy. This is a process," he added.</p>
      <p>"One thing is the end product and another thing<b> is the moment you start</b>. I'm not going to try to make some tactical tics, not incredible changes.</p>
      <p>"I am not going to try to be Einstein, but I am going to try to make the players play the way I like them to play.</p>
      <p>"<b>Offensive football, yes, but winning matches</b>, not offensive football and don't win a match for 10 or 11 months.</p>
      <p>"You are not going to see Harry Kane playing at left-back."</p>
      <p>Mourinho clearly has much grander ambitions for his star striker.</p>
