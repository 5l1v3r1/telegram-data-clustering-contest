      <p><b>in a new video, produced by <a href="https://plane-site.com/">PLANE–SITE</a> with the support of the <a href="https://europeanculturalcentre.eu/">european cultural centre</a>, doshi reflects on the personal and environmental implications of the home.</b> for the indian architect, a home is a living, sacred space that provides a basis for cooperation and tolerance, and, as he elaborates in the video, a home exists at many scales — from the family household to the planet we share. <i>‘how can the earth be separate from you?,’</i> he asks. <i>‘true sustainability is going towards an integral way of life, and an integral way of thinking.’</i></p>
