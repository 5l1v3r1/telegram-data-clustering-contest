      <p>Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, has said that Nigeria and South Africa are making plans to reach an agreement on assets recovery and repatriation.</p>
      <p>Magu made the disclosure at the closing ceremony of the two-week capacity-building and mentorship programme for 10 officials of the Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission at the EFCC Academy in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement, assets stolen from Nigeria to South Africa would be repatriated and vice versa, according to a report by TheCable.</p>
      <p>Magu said, “You know that corruption is a borderless crime and we have signed MoUs with several countries on the need to exchange information and intelligence and conduct joint operations.</p>
      <p>“Last week I was in South Africa; there is a process ongoing to sign an MoU that we can just walk to the country and recover assets stolen by our citizens with their help and likewise them over here too.”</p>
