      <p>A bill to ban the production, import and sale of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and similar products was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on November 22.</p>
      <p>The Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Bill, 2019, seeks to replace an ordinance issued on September 18.</p>
      <p>The minister later tweeted, "E-cigarettes cause attention, learning &amp; anxiety disorders in adolescents. It also furthers the risk of cardiovascular diseases. I would urge smokers NOT to try unapproved nicotine alternatives. Pls quit smoking completely."</p>
      <p>The bill makes the manufacturing, production, import, export, distribution, transport, sale, storage or advertisements of such alternative smoking devices a cognizable offence, attracting a jail term and a fine.</p>
      <p>First-time violators will face a jail term of up to one year and a fine of Rs 1 lakh. For subsequent offences, a jail term of up to three years or a fine of Rs 5 lakh, or both, according to the ordinance.</p>
      <p>The storage of e-cigarettes shall also be punishable with imprisonment of up to six months or a fine of up to Rs 50,000, or both, it said.</p>
      <p>The government had cited health risk to people, especially youth and issued an ordinance to ban such products.</p>
      <p>The bill authorised officials to conduct searches in premises, stating that where such searches were not permissible, authorities might attach properties, stocks of e-cigarettes or records maintained by the manufacturer, producer exporter, transporter, importer, stockist against whom a complaint had been made.</p>
      <p>It said the owner or occupier of the place that stocks e-cigarettes should voluntarily prepare a list of such stock in his possession and without delay submit the stock to the nearest authorised officer.</p>
      <p>However, e-cigarettes promoting trade bodies, users and other stakeholders have been opposing government's move to ban the "alternative" smoking device, alleging it was a "draconian" step taken in haste to protect the conventional cigarette industry.</p>
