      <h1>Ignore the Fightback, We Were Wrong – West Ham May Need to Sack Manuel Pellegrini After All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/13450461" target="_blank">Toby Cudworth</a></address>
      <p><b>​From the London Stadium - </b>Less than three weeks ago, I opened my laptop, had a good hard think and concluded that Manuel Pellegrini should be retained as West Ham manager.</p>
      <p>After all, knee-jerk reactions often get you nowhere in football.</p>
      <p>But what we've all come to learn over the years is that times have changed. The notion that a manager must be given time to turn around a sinking ship is very much a thing of the past - given what's at stake financially.</p>
      <p>That's why I accept that, maybe, I was wrong. Granted, that's a big shift in stance, given it's only been 18 days since that article was penned.</p>
      <p>
        <i>But.</i>

      <p>And there's a very big but.</p>
      <p>What we've seen over the past few weeks from the Hammers has been nothing short of embarrassing. Timid, gutless and spineless, things have taken a dramatic turn for the worst.</p>
      <p>First, it was against Newcastle at the London Stadium - a team who for the best part of 18 months have been unable to score goals. Against the Magpies, who were equally short of form and bereft of confidence, West Ham were absolutely abysmal.</p>
      <p>Three down just past the 50 minute mark, it could conceivably have been six. Brief fight, with a little help from the visitors, made the scoreline look vaguely respectable come full time, but those in the ground will have told you - from a West Ham perspective anyway - that it was a performance of nothingness that had been coming for a number of weeks.</p>
      <p>The Hammers' fragilities defensively had been laid bare in the embarrassing Carabao Cup defeat to Oxford back in September, and what was evident on this particular showing was that Pellegrini's side had not learnt their lessons. Simple things, like reacting to second balls and preventing headers from being turned across the face of goal. </p>
      <p>You know, the basic fundamentals of defending.</p>

      <p>If those performance wasn't bad enough, <a href="http://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">​West Ham</a> then rocked up at Burnley desperately needing to deliver a performance of some substance. <i>Something </i>that offered a glimmer of hope for supporters, and myself, that Pellegrini was aware that changes needed to be made.</p>
      <p>Alas, it was to be more of the same. Somehow, it was actually worse - with truly dreadful individual mistakes from Fabian Balbuena and Roberto (twice) gifting Sean Dyche's side two of the most gift-wrapped goals you will ever wish to see.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, those catastrophic lapses in concentration had followed yet more terrible defending at a set piece. James Tarkowski's nodded header back across the six-yard box for Ashley Barnes was a carbon copy of the goal scored by Ciaran Clark a week previously, and remarkably similar to the winning goal scored by Jordan Ayew for Crystal Palace at the London Stadium in early October.</p>
      <p><i>That</i>, you would have thought, would have been the catalyst for some long hard looks in the mirror from the players, and from Pellegrini himself, over the international break.</p>

      <p>But on the evidence of today's performance against Tottenham, led by Jose Mourinho for the first time, things are far worse than appeared possible. </p>
      <p>Tentative, lethargic and lacking in purpose, West Ham resembled a side who were lacking <i>any </i>form of belief. Spurs are, of course, a good side, we all know that. But they've had one hell of a week themselves, turfing out fan favourite Mauricio Pochettino after five and a half seasons at the club in favour of appointing Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Because of that, you'd have imagined they may be a little tentative, though no doubt pumped up, meaning the Hammers would come flying out of the traps. Looking to put Tottenham under pressure with relentless closing down and intelligent ball retention, stifling Mourinho's side in the early exchanges.</p>
      <p>Instead, <a href="http://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">​Tottenham</a> were allowed to drift around into pockets of space with ease, creating openings and half chances at will. Harry Kane's disallowed goal in the third minute a sign of what was to come.</p>
      <p>More worryingly, West Ham's lack of creative spark - which has become a recurring issue during this barren run of form - was again all too apparent, as a nervousness around the Spurs penalty area reared its head.</p>

      <p>Felipe Anderson, bought for approaching £40m last summer, doesn't have a drop of confidence  and looks unable to do the most simple of things. The same can be said for Sebastien Haller, though he lasted the full 90 minutes - unlike Anderson, who was hooked off before the 65th minute for the fourth time in five games.</p>
      <p>More on them another time.</p>
      <p>My worry, and it's a sentiment shared by a number of supporters, is that it's the same old thing, week in and week out. There doesn't appear to be a plan B, and you feel that once the Hammers have gone behind, there is an inevitably about the result.</p>
      <p>After the game, I was keen to see where Pellegrini's head was at - and I asked him in his post-match press conference if a run, that has seen the club pick up just two points out of the last available 21, meant a revision of targets this season - are West Ham now looking over their shoulders, rather than ahead?</p>
      <p>The Chilean was bullish in his response, insisting: "We need to try to win the next game. When we win, the media asked me the same question how high we will finish. We must win the next game. </p>

      <p>"This is not the result we have expected, especially at home, it is very tight this season and if we were three points more we would be further up the table. We need to improve in both defending and attacking."</p>
      <p>That suggests, to me anyway, that he's simply unsure of what to do next. There's more a hope that things will sort themselves out, rather than an admittance that things are wrong. He also got a little snooty after being probed about calamity Roberto in goal - a sure sign that he's feeling the pressure.</p>
      <p>So maybe, just maybe, West Ham's board need to look at the example set by today's visitors, and act before the club become embroiled in a painful scrap against relegation.</p>
      <p>Maybe, things need to change now.</p>
      <p>Maybe, Manuel should be shown the door.</p>
      <p>Maybe.</p>
