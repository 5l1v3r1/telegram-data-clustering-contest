      <p>A private shopping tour of <a href="https://faoschwarz.com/">FAO Schwartz</a> would make any child, and many adults, very happy but imagine if the legendary toy store’s ‘elves’ swept in to your hotel suite and literally decked the halls with every toy imaginable? The newly minted <a href="https://www.conradnewyorkmidtown.com/">Conrad Midtown</a> hotel is offering just that in their FAO Schwarz Toy Suite. It’s a fitting partnership, as the property is nicely tucked into a quiet street between Central Park and 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue and, more importantly, just blocks from the FAO Schwarz flagship store in Rockefeller Center. In the suite, Barbies line the bookshelves, stuffed giraffes hold court in the suite’s dining room and everything from tricked out play kitchen sets to interactive musical toys is yours for the asking.</p>

      <p>Offered during the holiday season from November 18 – January 5, the FAO Schwarz toy-filled suite features plush toys, nutcrackers, trains, and dolls—-the very things that make this iconic store so special. Guests of the suite are also treated to breakfast for four and a $100 FAO Schwarz gift card, but it’s the private after-hours shopping tour of the store, led by none other than the Toy Soldier, that seals the deal. If you can’t decide during your tour, you can always order the toys directly from the suite; the Conrad team will make sure they get shipped directly to your home after your stay. Parents, take note, you can also reserve this suite for birthday parties.</p>
      <p>When everyone has had their fill of toy-driven amusement, look to the nearby and recently re-opened <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA (Museum of Modern Art)</a> for some cultural inspiration. The Conrad teamed up with the museum to offer hotel guests the opportunity to book after-hours guided tours of the exhibits. The after-hours tour is a chance to explore the museum with an expert, a rare treat in this crowded world. You’ll have the spaces to yourself, and all the quiet needed to contemplate and savor the incredible MoMA collection.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the Conrad has done a commendable job bringing art into the stay experience. Their collection features 37 artists, including an original Henri Matisse lithograph, two original Andy Warhol silkscreens, and two limited-edition photographs by Amy Judd. The hotel’s pièce de résistance is the lobby centerpiece, Leda and the Swan, an eerily life-like sculpture by renowned contemporary artist Carole A. Feuerman.</p>

      <p>The Conrad Midtown, not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.conradnewyork.com/">Conrad New York Downtown</a>, recently re-opened after an extensive redesign of what was formerly The London NYC.  You’ll love the newly minted suites (it is an all-suite property) with sleek modernist design touches such as MoMA-inspired custom furnishings and jewel-toned textiles. By the numbers, the hotel spans 54 floors with 500 suites and 1,500 square foot fitness center. Rooms are spacious, ranging in size from 500 to 1,500 square feet. In a city where some hotel rooms eek by at 250 square feet, the Conrad practically gushes with space. Only one caveat—waits for the elevator can get frustrating but that’s life when you are perched high above Manhattan.</p>

      <p>In addition to MoMA and FAO Schwarz, the Conrad also has a cool partnership with Dyson, (each premium suite has a Dyson Supersonic™ Hair Dryer) and complimentary blowouts at the nearby 5th Avenue flagship Dyson Demo Store are offered—based upon availability. Not to be outdone, the guys can enjoy exclusive treatment package from Truman’s Gentlemen's Groomers. And, if your needs take you out and about in Manhattan, a luxury house car is available upon request.</p>
