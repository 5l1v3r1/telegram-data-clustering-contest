      <p>At Valencia they prefer to put a time frame on him. <b>Celades</b>, the Valencia coach, <b>spoke about Guedes' injury.</b> "He still needs a few weeks. I got his return date wrong once and I will not say again when he will return. <b>His return is not going to be imminent</b>," he said in a press conference. </p>
      <p>Valencia's aim, 'AS' says, <b>is for Guedes to come back into things gradually</b> and reappear on 8th January against Real Madrid in the semi-final of the Spanish Super Cup. </p>
