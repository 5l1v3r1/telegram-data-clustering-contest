      <h1>Klopp: Liverpool care about winning, not sending messages to rivals</h1>

        <b>Premier League leaders Liverpool do not care about winning by comprehensive scorelines, according to boss Jurgen Klopp.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp insists he is not interested in sending messages to Liverpool's Premier League rivals and is only concerned with winning games.</p>
      <p>The Reds were far from their fluent best against Crystal Palace on Saturday but claimed a 12th win in 13 league matches this season thanks to Roberto Firmino's late strike.</p>
      <p>It had looked like Liverpool would drop points when Wilfried Zaha cancelled out Sadio Mane's opener with eight minutes remaining but Firmino intervened in the 85th minute to seal a victory that maintains their eight-point lead at the summit.</p>
      <p>"It is exceptional to have 37 points after 13 games," he said after the triumph at Selhurst Park. "You can't have them by winning brilliant games every time.</p>
      <p>"We had a couple of them but you can't always win them. We aren't here to send messages; we just want to get results."</p>
      <p>Palace were comfortably the better side in the opening period but Liverpool improved markedly after the interval, much to Klopp's delight.</p>

      <p>"I'm not surprised by how the game went," the German added. "We know it's a tough place to come; the atmosphere is good. They don't give up.</p>
      <p>"We knew at half-time that we had to do better. <b>We weren't brilliant but we were ready to fight for the result</b>."</p>
      <p>Mohamed Salah was an unused substitute after failing to fully recover from a lingering ankle injury that kept him out of the most recent Egypt squad.</p>
      <p>Klopp said he only returned to full training on Friday but is likely to be fit enough to feature against Napoli in the Champions League on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"<b>Mo is all good</b>," he said. "He couldn't train for nine days. [Friday] was the first time at 100 per cent, so we had then to make the decision of whether we started him or not.</p>
      <p>"We didn't start him; we wanted to bring him on as you probably saw but then we scored. So, we could rest him. <b>That's really good and Wednesday he will be back."</b></p>
