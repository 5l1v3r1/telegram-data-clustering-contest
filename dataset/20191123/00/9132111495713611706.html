      <p>Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta has said the main reason why Ghana must have a National Cathedral is because Ghana is a Christian nation and ought to show appreciation to God for his blessings.</p>
      <p>In a MyNewsGh.com-monitored news interview with Multimedia’s Osei Bonsu Phillip, Ken Ofori Atta said he doesn’t understand the complaints about the “tiny land” being allocated to God, wondering if the public would rather have real estate agents use the land instead of God.</p>
      <p>“It is a beautiful thing and it is a memorial to God. This huge country God has given us, we taking a small 3 acres for God and we are crying. It is hard.” He said.</p>
      <p>Asked how much it will cost as a whole and what percentage government is contributing, he replied “as for the Cathedral, we said we will give a seed money, I think we have to fulfill that. It should be anywhere between 10 and 20 million dollars” he said.</p>
      <p>“The things of God make me afraid.. God will build his thing but we have to do our part. It is certainly about 100m dollars”</p>
      <p>Queried by O.B about whether a Cathedral best reflects our national priorities as a “poor country”, Mr. Ofori Atta retorted “This issue you’re saying, are you not afraid?”</p>
      <p>According to him Ghana as a Christian nation ought to be grateful to God.</p>
      <p>“From 1957 to where God has brought us and the blessings He has given us and now a small land we are giving to God should rather be given to real estate agents? I get afraid. Because we are a Christian country, even if we don’t do it, the stones themselves will get up and do it”.</p>

        <b>About Cathedral</b>
      </p>
      <p>The National Cathedral of Ghana is a planned interdenominational Christian cathedral scheduled to be built in Accra as part of Ghana’s 60th anniversary celebrations. The design for the cathedral was unveiled by President Nana Akufo-Addo, in March 2018.</p>
      <p>The cathedral will have an auditorium capable of seating 5,000 as well as the requisite chapels, and a baptistery. The site will also house a music school, an art gallery, and a museum dedicated to the Bible.</p>
      <p>The design of the cathedral reflects the art and culture of Ghanaian ethnic groups; the high pitched and staggered roof is reminiscent of Akan inspired architecture and the facade will be concave and decorated with timber in imitation of Ashanti royal stools. The architect for the project is the British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, who also designed the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p>
