      <p>When planning a Thanksgiving dinner menu, there’s likely to be a roast turkey and a whole lot of starchy sides. But take a moment to consider adding a lasagna to the mix, and take the entire dinner up a delicious notch.</p>

      <p>"We had lasagna on our table for every holiday. At Thanksgiving, it was next to the turkey and at Christmas, next to the prime rib and ham,” said celebrity chef Michael Symon, owner of many restaurants across the country, including his Italian restaurant <a href="https://www.theborgata.com/dining/fine-dining/angeline-by-michael-symon#t#overview">Angeline</a>, named after his mother, at The Borgata in Atlantic City, in an interview.</p>
      <p>Symon’s family always had lasagna at the holidays, but it wasn’t limited to special occasions. In fact, the lasagna on the table was itself a special occasion. “One of my favorite things to eat as a kid. I've said numerous times in interviews if I had like, what's your what would your last meal be? This would be my last meal,” said Symon while demonstrating making his mother’s lasagna recipe. “Nothing I like eating more!”</p>
      <p>Symon’s lasagna is a unique one that reflects his Greek and Italian roots. “I think what my mom does when she cooks sometimes, is she mixes some Italian with some Greek in the way she cooks.” For example, a classic bechamel typically will not have eggs in it, but the one in this lasagna does. “Pastitsio is like the Greek version of lasagna. The sauce is thickened with a little bit of eggs so my mom purposely the sauce of her bechamel and her lasagna is the same exact sauce. Two birds with one stone,” said Symon. “I'm using ricotta and mozzarella but she would make it for pastitsio instead of using ricotta and mozzarella, she would use goat cheese and fat. And so that's where that changed me but the technique is still the same,” he said.</p>
      <p>There’s also nutmeg, another interesting find in a lasagna recipe. “We also put salt, pepper and nutmeg in here. Nutmeg ia  great spice that you don't be shy with it. It really brings a lot to the table, especially when it is near meat,” said Symon.</p>
      <p>The recipe will adapt well for vegetarians at dinner as well, making it a great option for any guests who can’t eat the turkey. "You can substitute eggplant for meat in the bolognese, no problem!” said Symon.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Directions:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>For the Pasta Dough: </i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mound the “00” or all-purpose flour on a cutting board or countertop.  Sprinkle the salt over it. Form a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yolks.  Add the olive oil and break each yolk. Using a plastic bench scraper or your fingers, draw the flour over the yolks from the perimeter.  Continue to mix the flour into the yolks until it’s all incorporated, kneading only enough for it to come together. Shape it into a rectangle about 1⁄2 inch thick.  The mixture should be dense, flaky and crumbly. Wrap the dough tightly in plastic wrap and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into four pieces.  Take one piece of dough (keeping others covered) and flatten it with your hands.  If the dough feels very dry, dampen the surface with a few drops of water using your fingers or pastry brush.  Starting with the rollers of your pasta machine set to the widest setting, passing the dough through, five or six times or until the dough begins to become pliable.  Do the same for the remaining pieces. Narrow the rollers by one setting and roll each piece through it once. Continue narrowing the rollers and rolling the pasta through each consecutive setting one time until the dough has reached the desired thickness. Blanch the pasta sheets in salted boiling water then shock in ice water. Drain and keep covered until you are ready to build the lasagna. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>For the Béchamel: </i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Melt the butter then whisk in the flour to form a roux.  Toast for about 1 minute then whisk in 1/3 of the milk. Continue to whisk until smooth then whisk in the rest of the milk. Season with salt and nutmeg then bring to a simmer while whisking almost constantly. </li>
        <li>Simmer for 15 minutes then check the seasoning, adding more salt if needed. Remove from the heat and whisk in the ricotta, mozzarella and egg yolks. Set aside.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>For the Bolognese:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heat a large saucepan with olive oil. Brown the ground beef with a large pinch of salt then remove and let drain. Add the onion and garlic to the saucepan and cook for 3 minutes. Add carrots and celery, and cook for another 3 minutes. Deglaze pan with white wine .Return the ground beef to the pan along with the tomatoes, breaking them up as you stir them and bring to a simmer. Add the bay leaf and oregano and taste for seasoning.  You may want to add a little salt here. Simmer for about 2 hours, skimming off any excess fat that comes to the top. Set aside.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>For the Pomodoro: </i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Place a saucepan over medium heat and add ¼ c olive oil. Add the onions and garlic and a large pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables soften, 8-10 minutes. Stir in chili flakes and tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Tie the oregano and thyme together with a piece of butchers twine then add it to the sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook over medium low heat for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the herb bundle and puree on low to preserve the red color.  Set aside.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <i>The build:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you’re ready to build the lasagna, mix 4 parts Bolognese with 1 part pomodoro. Reserve the remaining pomodoro for the top of the lasagna and for serving. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>To build the lasagna: Ladle a thin layer of pomodoro in to the bottom of the pan. Cover the surface with a few sheets of pasta, allowing them to lay flat. Alternate layers of meat sauce, pasta and cheese sauce until you get to 8 layers. End with a smooth layer of pomodoro on top then cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes-1 hour, until warmed through. Uncover and continue to bake for another 15-20 minutes, until golden brown on top. Remove from the oven and let set for 15 minutes before slicing and serving with additional warm pomodoro and fresh basil.</li>
