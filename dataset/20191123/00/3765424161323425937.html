      <p>A 34-year-old suspect was arrested at the Beitbridge border post on Thursday for trying to smuggle explosives into the country from Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Police said the explosives were contained in four-gallon (roughly 15l) plastic containers being transported on a trailer. The suspect initially told police that the containers contained oil.</p>
      <p>“He was then directed towards the baggage scanner. When the containers were subsequently opened, 398 pieces of blasting cartridges (explosive gel) were found and the suspect was immediately arrested,” police said.</p>
      <p>They added that the suspect, who is from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe, would appear soon in the Musina magistrate’s court on charges of possession of explosive materials.</p>
      <p>“The motive for the smuggling is not known at this stage, however police investigations are continuing.”</p>
