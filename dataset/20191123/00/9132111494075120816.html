      <p>10 fishermen have been rescued by the port sea patrol team in the early hours of Thursday, 14th November 2019.</p>
      <p>The boat of the fishermen, christened Matthew 77 capsized following a wind storm at anchorage, which led to the seizure of the outboard motor of the fishing boat.</p>
      <p>In attempts to refuel the boat, the strong winds turned them over along with the fuel and the 30 crates of fish they had captured during their expedition.</p>
      <p>“The vessel by name MTETC Nefertari sent out a distress call at anchorage which was responded quickly by the team who rescued the fisher folks whose boat had capsized into the sea,” the Deputy Port Security Manager, Kingsley Darko narrated.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Port Security Manager, Kingsley Darko reported that no fatalities were recorded and cautioned the fishing community to be watchful of the current weather conditions.</p>
      <p>“They must also take account of the weather and the climatic condition around which they operate so that when they see the sea is turbulent or the wind is not friendly they must not go to the sea,” he cautioned.</p>
      <p>He also encouraged the use of life jackets by all fisher folk who embark on fishing expeditions.</p>
      <p>“The advice we want to send out there to our fishing community who are also our major stakeholders as far as the port’s enclave is concerned is that they must ensure that they take all the safety precautions.”</p>
