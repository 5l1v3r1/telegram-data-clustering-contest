        <b>Dan Ticktum says he has had interest from multiple Formula 1 teams about a junior-programme role, and that he would consider quitting motorsport if reaching F1 is not possible.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Red Bull dropped Ticktum from its driver programme and his Super Formula seat in May, and he has spent most of the remainder of the year working on a deal for 2020.</p>
      <p>The two-time Macau Grand Prix winner has been heavily linked to a Formula 2 seat, with DAMS rumoured to be the most likely destination for the 20-year-old.</p>
      <p>Sean Gelael has also been linked to a seat at the French outfit that has fielded Nicholas Latifi and Sergio Sette Camara this year, both of whom are expected to leave the team.</p>
      <p>Ticktum said he believes that if he performs in his destination championship next year, he has a chance of joining an F1 team.</p>
      <p>"We've got something sorted [for next year], I can't go into more detail than that," Ticktum told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people will know which direction I'll be going in. It will all come out very soon.</p>
      <p>"F1 is the end goal. I've been like that since I started going down the single-seater route.</p>
      <p>"If I can't get to F1, I'll probably - unless I get a very good deal in something else - forget motorsport if I'm honest.</p>
      <p>"You never know when you're in the situation, if you don't get to F1 and you're given an amazing Formula E contract, you probably wouldn't turn it down.</p>
      <p>"It's very different when you're in the position [being offered something outside of F1], but the end goal is very much Formula 1.</p>
      <p>"I'm always quite realistic with my goals and I think it is realistic.</p>
      <p>"If I didn't think it was realistic, I'd say. I do still think it's a possibility."</p>
      <p>Asked if he had looked at joining another junior programme, Ticktum said: "I've had interest from a few people and a few teams, they're all saying more or less the same thing, which is, 'Go and prove yourself' in what I'll be doing next year.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully if I have a good year next year I think that will open a lot of doors.</p>
      <p>"Even Red Bull's, who knows."</p>

      <p>Ticktum returned to competition with Van Amersfoort at the end of the Formula Regional European season - finishing no worse than eighth in six races - and returned to Macau in an attempt to become the first driver to win the Grand Prix three consecutive times.</p>
      <p>He was caught up in a pile up in a qualification race, but fought back to 13th from the back end of the 30-car grid in the main race.</p>
