      <h1>10 Women On Their Break-Up Hair Transformations (With Pictures)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Katy Harrington</a></address>
      <p>There are several stages you go through after a bad <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-end-a-relationship">break-up</a>: disbelief (can this be happening?), denial (this isn't happening), anger (I hate you!), rage (I never loved you anyway and I'm going to sleep with all your friends) and acceptance (maybe it was all for the best really). Then it's haircut time.<br/><br/>Maybe it's the relationship rug being pulled out from under your feet that makes you reassess every other part of your life but often, when we need to feel and see immediate change, our hair seems like a good place to start (and it's less painful than getting that ill-advised <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/white-ink-tattoo">tattoo</a> of their name on your forearm removed). For some, including the inimitable Lizzo, a 'shampoo press' is enough to get someone out of your hair but others need a more dramatic change – something that says 'I've changed and I'm moving on'.</p>

      <p><b>Sonya, 32</b><br/><br/><b>How long were you with your S.O? </b>We were together for about a year and a half. Which isn’t incredibly long, but still long enough for it to be super tough to end the relationship.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change? </b>I felt like I hadn’t been myself for a long time and that I had tried to become someone else in the relationship. I realised how harmful this had been and felt like going back to my essence and just doing what was best for me. I guess it was a sort of symbol of empowerment towards myself.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>What did you do to your hair?</b> I had previously had my naturally dark brown hair balayaged and dyed blonde while me and my ex were together. Kind of strange thinking about it now, as his ex and all the celebrities he has crushes on were blonde... I decided to cut a bit of it off and go back to dark brown, to just be me again without feeling like I had to be or do anything extra.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it? </b>I actually did it the day before I broke up with him. I had been thinking about breaking up for a while, things hadn’t been going well and the relationship had become extremely toxic. Dyeing my hair dark again was part of the process of gathering my courage to end the relationship.<br/><br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> I felt great, I was finally starting to feel like my genuine self again after a very long period of having lost touch with my identity.<br/><br/><b>How long did you keep the new style for?</b> I kept it dark for three months and have now used henna to colour it slightly red while I went away travelling by myself.<br/> </p>

      <p><b>Natasha, 24</b><br/><br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b><br/>Two years.<br/> <br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change?</b> Shortly after the break-up I was on a plane to China for six months to work, watching <i>A Star Is Born</i> while drinking free wine.<br/> <br/><b>What did you do to your hair?</b><br/>I dyed it bright orange – just like Gaga in the film.<br/> <br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it?</b> I had to wait until my first paycheque in China, so maybe six weeks.<br/> <br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b><br/>Like it was a fresh start. New hair, new me.<br/> <br/><b>How long did you keep the new style for?</b><br/>I still have it but it is less orange now and more of a natural ginger.</p>

      <p><b>Libbi, 24</b><br/> <br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b> One and a half years. <br/><b> <br/>What made you want to make a massive hair change? </b>While we were together, my ex was very attached to my long hair and hated that I wanted it cut. My long hair was a huge part of my identity throughout that relationship, so when we broke up I felt free from his judgement and wanted a whole new me. <br/><i> </i><br/><b>What was the dramatic change?</b> I went for a short bob.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How long after you broke up did you choose to get a new hairstyle?</b> I had the cut one day after the break-up. <br/><i> </i><br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> As soon as I had the cut I felt amazing. My haircut represented a whole new beginning for me. It was a long-distance relationship (UK, USA) and I spent a LOT of my time, money, energy and happiness on making it work, so the break-up was a release. My family and I named it Operation Libbi 2.0. I was so excited to start my new life and have full control over it. <br/> <br/><b>How long did you keep the style for?</b> This was in 2016 and I’ve been rocking the bob ever since. Only recently have I been growing it out but I do ponder on a chop every now and then! </p>

      <p><b>Iman, 24</b><br/><br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b> Six years. <br/> <br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change? </b>I had seen a few girls on Instagram with cute short hair and I thought I wanted to look exactly like them. Also Solange, in 2010 she cut her short hair and I feel like she evolved as an artist from then onwards. I wanted that.<br/> <br/><b>What was the dramatic change?</b> I cut my hair into a short TWA (tapered afro) hairstyle.<br/> <br/><b>How long after you broke up did you choose to get a new hairstyle?</b> I actually cut my hair while we were kind of still together, I guess it was a cry for the attention I craved from him. I got it but shortly after that we broke up. <br/> <br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b><br/>Cutting my hair taught me so much about myself, I do believe Coco Chanel's saying: "A woman who cuts her hair is about to change her life." My life changed massively after that.<br/> <br/><b>How long did you keep the style for?</b> About six months before it started growing at an awkward length so I started wearing my wigs again!</p>

      <p><b>Bea, 25</b><br/><br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b> Under a year.<br/><b><i> </i></b><br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change?</b> It was after I ended a relationship with the first boy I ever 'loved'. At the time I thought the relationship defined my progression from being a girl to a woman and when it ended I felt like a lost young girl all over again. I wanted to take back my power and rebel against society's standards. <br/><br/>I didn't know who I was anymore, I felt like I had to redefine myself and feel like I had control over something. At the time I told my male boss I wanted to cut all my hair off; he told me not to as "long hair is beautiful and no man considers women with short hair attractive". That evening I booked the appointment.<br/><b><i> </i></b><br/><b>What was the dramatic change?</b> I cut my long blonde hair into a pixie cut.<br/> <br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it?</b> Four weeks.<br/> <br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> Powerful.<br/> <br/><b>How long did you keep the style for?</b> Two years.</p>

      <p><b>Aga, 25</b><br/> <br/><b>How long were you with your S.O? </b>Three months (but terribly in love!).<br/><i> </i><br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change?</b> I was already planning to donate my hair to charity, but in six months time. But after the break-up I felt the urge to do it sooner – I was tired with how long it was, how annoyed I was with it, I needed a change!<br/><i> </i><br/><b>What did you do to your hair? </b>Cut it short (donated to a charity), then made it even shorter after another month.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it?</b> About a month – when I definitely lost all hope of a reunion.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> Amazing! My self-confidence grew immediately, I felt stronger, empowered...and I helped other people as well! Also, people started treating me more seriously and professionally. And fewer men were hitting on me, which was very much appreciated at the time, to be left alone.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How long did you keep the new style for? </b>Almost a year – I grew it a bit longer after 10 months or so.</p>

      <p><b>Faduma, 30</b><br/> <br/><b>How long were you with your S.O? </b>Seven months. He was my first boyfriend, if I could call him that.<br/> <br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change? </b>It was my first heartbreak and it changed me. I guess I wanted to match my new dark insides with my outsides.<br/> <br/><b>What was the dramatic change? </b>I got a fob in the style of Victoria Beckham by suggestion of the sociopath hairdresser. <br/> <br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it? </b>A few days.<br/> <br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> I loved it at first, it looked so sleek and it was such a dramatic change. I had never had my hair that short and for good reason! I have long curly hair and a short, straight, sharp cut really made me feel like a whole new person.<br/> <br/><b>How long did you keep the style for? </b>Well, I soon realised why I would never have chosen a short haircut if I was in my right frame of mind. On that particular day it was raining and my short sleek haircut, which made me look like a beautiful ebony Victoria Beckham, quickly transformed under the harsh weather to little orphan Annie. I had to wait years for my hair to grow back and since that day I have never gone into a hairdresser's under emotional distress or considered cutting my hair short ever again... Thank god for wigs! </p>

      <p><b>Amber, 22</b><br/><br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b> Three years.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change?</b> I wanted to look and feel like a different person to who I was when we were together, dyeing my hair felt like physically washing away any pain or upset from the relationship.<br/> <br/><b>What did you do to your hair?</b> I went from my natural dark colour to bright purple/blue. After any bad life experience I have either changed my hair to another unnatural colour or got piercings/tattoos. It makes me feel empowered, knowing that my ex hasn't seen my body the way it is now after changing some aspect. <br/><i> </i><br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it?</b> When I had regained my confidence and recovered from the break-up.<br/> <br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> It made me feel empowered, like a new woman. It raised my confidence and reminded me to be proud of myself for surviving.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How long did you keep the new style for?</b> Just until it needed touching up. More recently I have tried to avoid using haircuts as a coping mechanism as it can become expensive, but also you should never change yourself for anyone or to avoid your problems. Self-love and acceptance of what has happened is the only way to truly heal.<br/> </p>

      <p><b>Alex,</b><i><b> </b></i><b>26</b><br/> <br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b> An intense year and a half. <br/> <br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change?</b> Looking back, I wanted to work out who I was as an individual, rather than be the same person I was in a relationship that had engulfed my life. I was scared that I would lose friends when we split up, so wanted to show that I was fun and worth staying friends with. At the time, I felt I was being my 'authentic self' and showing that to the world, but I realise now I didn't need to change my hair to love myself. <br/><i> </i><br/><b>What did you do to your hair?</b> I had a mermaid balayage: blue, green, pink and purple throughout, with my dark brown roots. It took about four hours to do.<br/><i> </i><br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it?</b> Three months after, but a few weeks after I found out he had been cheating on me. <br/><i> </i><br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> I was a bit shocked when I looked in the mirror, I had only gone in for one colour but was convinced to have four by the hairdresser. But I felt like a fabulous, sexy mermaid! <br/><i> </i><br/><b>How long did you keep the new style for?</b> The colours faded after three weeks, but I kept dyeing it pink and purple for about a year after. I really liked the bright colours and felt it was a way of brightening up my darker days while I worked out who I could be on my own. I feel like it was a bold and important move in my life and would recommend a change in style to anyone who wants to easily change their image. Four years later, I've started a new relationship and now have a blunt bob to celebrate a new start.</p>

      <p><b>Gráinne, 22</b><br/> <br/><b>How long were you with your S.O?</b> I was with him for a year in total, serious stuff indeed! <br/> <br/><b>What made you want to make a massive hair change?</b> His housemate at the time suggested that given my eye colour (grey/blue), I would suit a silver/grey tone. All very convincing stuff, so when the break-up occurred, with a new sense of confidence I said 'yes, absolutely'. (It went proper Pete Tong, it was green at first.) <br/> <br/><b>What did you do to your hair?</b> First step was to cut my LONG dark brown hair right up to my shoulders, a budget bob if you will. I then spent a small fortune in Superdrug on bleach and toner and really went for the grand finish, platinum/silver. I wanted to look like a slick, gorgeous version of Malfoy's father but in reality, because it went murky green, I looked like a poor man's Atlantic Ocean. <br/> <br/><b>How soon after the break-up did you do it?</b> It was genuinely a number of days post-break-up, and on reflection so uncomfortable. Because of course the whole transformation process HAD to happen at his flat because that’s where his flatmate who suggested the move lived.<br/> <br/><b>How did you feel about it afterwards?</b> I felt like a bad bitch, I won’t sugar coat it. Someone asked if I’d done it for a show I was in at the time, which would usually have tainted my mood, but at this stage it didn’t even bother me. I like to think I looked edgy, that’s what I’m rolling with!<br/> <br/><b>How long did you keep the new style for?</b> Until this day. I had a slight intermission, where I went pink for a while, then back to my natural colour to allow my hair to grow and not be straw for a while! But eventually I fixed it to blonde (post-green) and stuck with the bob – it’s now been four years!</p>
