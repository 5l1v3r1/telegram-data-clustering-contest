      <p>A union representing Canadian National railway staff working at a Halifax shipping terminal says the ongoing strike has resulted in 70 people receiving temporary layoff notices.</p>
      <p>Unifor says the short-term cuts were initially projected to affect 250 staff working at the inland terminal known as Autoport, but CN later rescinded the layoff notices for 180 people.</p>
      <p>The 70 employees facing layoffs are expected to be temporarily out of work as of Nov. 28.</p>
      <p>The strike by CN workers, now into its fifth day, has hampered shipments of cars at the Autoport facility.</p>
      <p>About 3,200 CN staff across the country, who have been without a contract since July 23, walked off the job early Tuesday morning over worries about long hours, fatigue and what they consider dangerous working conditions.</p>
      <p>The federal government has faced mounting pressure to resolve the strike as premiers and industry members voice concerns about lost profits and a propane shortage affecting Quebec, Ontario and the Maritimes.</p>
      <p>“The union remains in communication with the company to advocate for all members, and to negate the damaging effects of these unnecessary cuts,” Unifor said in a previous statement addressing layoffs at Autoport.</p>
      <p>While the striking rail workers are part of the Teamsters union, the furloughs in Halifax affect Unifor members who are not on strike but who work at CN’s Halifax facility and handle vehicles shipped in by rail.</p>
      <p>Workers at other CN facilities may also be vulnerable to temporary layoffs as the railway is operating at 10 per cent capacity.</p>
      <p>CN declined to confirm the Autoport furloughs, but expressed disappointment with the ongoing strike and acknowledged that it is having impacts that are being felt beyond the immediate picket lines.</p>
      <p>“This has been affecting all of our operations, including at Autoport,” CN said in an email.</p>
      <p>The Teamsters union said Saturday no substantial progress has been made as negotiations continue around the clock in Montreal under the watch of federal mediators.</p>
      <p>The strike could cost the Canadian economyupwards of $3 billion if it continues until Dec. 5 — when Parliament is scheduled to resume — according to TD senior economist Brian DePratto.</p>
      <p>Industries from farming to mining, forestry and fertilizer have urged Ottawa to take immediate action to resolve the dispute, with some echoing the Alberta government’s push to reconvene Parliament early and pass back-to-work legislation.</p>
      <p>Others such as the National Farmers Union have called for further negotiation to address rail workers’ safety concerns.</p>
      <p>With more than 90 per cent of grain moved by rail, the Teamsters’ work stoppage has triggered worries among grain elevator operators and farmers — who also use propane to dry grain and heat barns and greenhouses — about lost sales and contract penalties following a soggy harvest.</p>
      <p>CN Rail has rejected the union’s claim that the strike concerns workplace health and safety, suggesting instead that it revolves around worker compensation. Salaries amount to an average of $114,000 a year for a train conductor, CN said.</p>
      <p>The railway is calling on the union to enter into binding arbitration, with an arbitrator chosen by the parties or appointed by the federal government.</p>
      <p>Last week CN confirmed job cuts as it deals with a weakening North American economy that has eroded demand for railroad transportation. A company source acknowledged 1,600 employees will be laid off from union and management positions.</p>
