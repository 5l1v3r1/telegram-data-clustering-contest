      <h1>Bournemouth 1-2 Wolves: Report, Ratings &amp; Reaction as Strong Wanderers Extend League Unbeaten Run</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/14802728" target="_blank">Nischal Schwager-Patel</a></address>
      <p>Wolves moved into the Europa League spots with a win on Saturday afternoon, as they beat Bournemouth 2-1 at the Vitality Stadium.</p>
      <p>​</p>
      <p>Wolves started well and broke the deadlock in style, with a wonderful strike from Joao Moutinho. The free kick angle on the edge of the box looked too tight for the Portuguese to go for goal, but he struck it perfectly into the top corner to put the visitors in the lead.</p>
      <p>The Wanderers doubled their advantage just after the half hour mark, as Raul Jimenez finished off a neatly worked goal. Moutinho took his free kick quickly and threaded it through to Adama Traore, who put it on a plate for Jimenez to poke the ball past Aaron Ramsdale in goal.</p>

      <p>It got even worse for Bournemouth, as captain Simon Francis was sent off for a second booking. He received his second yellow card for an unnecessary pull on Digo Jota's arm, as his first league start in almost a year ended in disappointing fashion.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth got themselves back into the game in the second half, thanks to Steve Cook's great header. Cook made a clever run round the back of the defence to meet Ryan Fraser's corner, and glanced his effort into the far corner to pull one back for the Cherries.</p>

      <h3>BOURNEMOUTH</h3>

        <b>Key Talking Point</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/bournemouth">​Bournemouth</a> never really seemed like they were in the game, with their visitors all over them from the first whistle. There wasn't much they could've done about the first goal, but although Wolves' second was wonderful it was worrying to see how easily the Cherries were cut open.</p>
      <p>The Cherries didn't seem confident and were chasing the ball all afternoon, and when they were in possession they showed no real threat. They did keep going and scored a nice goal to pull one back but Bournemouth couldn't do enough to get a result.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth now have just one league win in their last seven, falling out of the top half following a tough defeat. Eddie Howe's side need to address how they lost control of the game within the opening half hour, as it ended in another bitter loss at the Vitality Stadium.</p>

      <p><b>STAR MAN - </b>Bournemouth's only positive take from the game was the performance of Steve Cook, whose excellent goal gave them a glimmer of hope. The defender was key in attack, with some crucial passes throughout along with his consolation making it a decent day for Cook.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/wolverhampton">​Wolves</a> began the game in lively fashion, and their strong start was rewarded with Moutinho's superb strike. They looked the better side at the Vitality Stadium, as they were confident going forward and were solid at the back, showing no sign of conceding.</p>
      <p>Their second goal was wonderfully worked, and from then on their dominance was unbreakable. The Wanderers were in cruise control and were playing brilliantly to do so away from home, and although Bournemouth's consolation made it a nervy end, Wolves held on for a big win.</p>
      <p>Nuno Espirito Santo's side continue their fine form, as they make it eight <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a></p>
      <p>games unbeaten with just one defeat in across their last 13 games in all competitions. </p>

      <p><b>STAR MAN - </b>Wolves can thank their midfield maestro Joao Moutinho for that win, as the Portuguese international had a wonderful game. His goal was sublime and his beautiful pass led to Wolves' second, with his passing and presence across the pitch key throughout the game.</p>
