      <p>In holdover news for Friday, Fox’s <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>earned $4.5 million (-59%) on its second Friday for a $15.4 million (-51%) second weekend and $57.44 million ten-day total. That’s not a great hold, but it should still end its run, Oscar bumps notwithstanding, with around $90 million domestic. How the $98 million Christian Bale/Matt Damon racing flick performs overseas will determine its profitability. It’s still in better shape than <i>Ad Astra</i>, but we’ll see where the overseas figures stand tomorrow. Paramount and Walden’s <i>Playing with Fire </i>earned another $1.06 million (-44%) on Friday for a likely $4.98 million (-28%) third weekend and $32 million 7-day cume. That’s decent for a live-action kid pick in 2019, although the $29 million budget means it needs strong overseas grosses. Lionsgate’s <i>Midway </i>earned $1.38 million (-45%) on Friday for a likely $4.75 million (-44%) third weekend and a $43.1 million 17-day total. The $100 million Roland Emmerich movie is a global bust, but Lionsgate should make money since it was only on the hook for domestic/UK distribution fees and expenses.</p>
      <p>Warner Bros.’ <i>The Good Liar</i>, which is a damn good time at the movies, earned another $1.03 million (-37%) on Friday for a likely $3.62 million (-35%) second weekend and $12 million ten-day total. Bill Condon’s Ian McKellen/Helen Mirren con man thriller isn’t exactly a hit, but it did cost only $10 million to produce. Universal’s <i>Last Christmas </i>earned $940,000 (-53%) on Friday for a $3.14 million (-52%) third weekend and a poor $27.9 million 17-day cume.</p>
      <p>Sony’s <i>Charlie’s Angels </i>earned just $970,000 (-69%) on Friday for a likely $3.13 million (-63%) second weekend and miserable $13.896 million ten-day cume. The Elizabeth Banks actioner may not have deserved to be a super-hit, but it damn well deserved better than this. Warner Bros.’ <i>Joker </i>earned another $760,000 (-48%) to bring its cume to $324.8 million domestic and $1.025 billion worldwide. It has passed/will pass <i>Deadpool 2 </i>($324 million) and <i>Suicide Squad </i>($325 million) in raw domestic earnings, with <i>Batman v Superman </i>next on the proverbial chopping block. Focus Features’ <i>Harriet </i>earned $660,000 (-47%) on Friday for a $2.3 million (-50%) fourth weekend and $36 million 24-day total. It has tripled its opening weekend and doubled its $17 million budget. <i>Terminator: Dark Fate </i>will earn $1.29 million (-70%) for a $59 million 24-day total.</p>
