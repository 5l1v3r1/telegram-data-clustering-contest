      <h1>Power, water disrupted on Kumbarpet Main Road</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:30</time> by <a rel="author">Y Maheswara Reddy</a></address>
      <p><i>Contractor used earth mover to replace UGD pipes, damaging power and water lines on the road and plunging the street in darkness for 10 days</i> <br/><br/>Here is a classic example of how reckless the contractors engaged by Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) are. The BWSSB has engaged a contractor to replace old underground drainage (UGD) pipes on the Kumbarpet Main Road to avoid clogging and overflow of sewage from manholes. The objective deserves appreciation but the way the pipes are replaced needs to be condemned. <br/><br/>According to the traders on Kumbarpet Main Road, around 60 shops had no electricity for more than 10 days thus compelling them not only to depend on candles for light in the evenings, but also losing business due to the lack of street lights. <br/><br/>“We have suffered a lot. I am yet to get electricity despite approaching the authorities many many times. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) engineers told me that if I need electricity, I will have to supply them with the cable that costs Rs 15,000,’’ said Pradeep Jain of Prakash Book Manufacturers.</p>

      <p>–Ravichandra BR of Eshwar Novelties<br/><br/><br/>The businessmen have complained against the recklessness of the contractor who engaged an earth moving machine to dug the road and remove old UGD pipes. <br/><br/>“While removing the old UGD pipes, the earth moving machine removed water pipes and electricity cables thus depriving us electricity and water,’’ said Ravichandra BR of Eshwar Novelties. <br/><br/>Due to lack of water, the businessmen are not able to use the toilets at the shopping complexes. They have to depend on public toilets situated at a considerable distance from the busy Kumbarpet Main Road.</p>

      <p>“I got a temporary power supply on Wednesday and will now have to spend money to have permanent electricity at my shop. Due to their negligence, I have incurred massive loss for the past two weeks. I hope the authorities fix this problem as early as possible,’’ said K Shekar of Nandi Paint House. <br/><br/>Due to the digging, the roads have also become slushy on most part of the stretch, disrupting the handcart vendors movement. “The delay in fixing the problem is not only causing problems for businessmen but also depriving livelihood for street vendors,’’ said a businessman on a condition of anonymity. <br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dharmarayaswamy Temple ward corporator Prathibha Dhanaraj has said the BWSSB had dug up the road to replace old UGD pipes, that were laid more than three decades ago. “It was tough for the workers to remove the old UGD pipes manually. And thus, the contractor had engaged an earth moving machine to remove the old UGD pipes. Water pipes and electric cables were damaged while removing the old UGD pipes. I have already asked the Bescom engineers to restore electricity to the shops. I will lead a delegation to the Bescom Managing Director if the electricity is not restored on a permanent basis. I will also ask the BWSSB engineers to restore water supply as early as possible,’’ said Prathibha Dhanaraj.</p>
