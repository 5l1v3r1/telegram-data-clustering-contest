      <p>OK, $15 off might not sound like much, but considering we got a measly $7 only off for the AirPods last year, this feels pretty good:</p>

        <b>Apple AirPods Pro </b>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4">
          <s>$249</s>
          <b> $234.98 at Amazon</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>We gave the Apple AirPods Pro 4.5 / 5 stars in our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro-review">Apple AirPods Pro review</a>, making them some of our all-time favorite earbuds. As well as bringing quality sound and that distinctive AirPods style, they have good noise cancellation, hearing health tracking and a superior fit over the original AirPods.View Deal</p>
      <p>We're going to count this as one entry, but the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-watch-5-review">new Apple Watch</a> getting any kind of price cut is something we were looking for this Black Friday. It might not be much, but it's better than nothing if you were looking for the Watch 5 as a gift.</p>

      <p>The Pixel 3a for under $250 is a laughably good deal. Great camera, lower spec but now a price to match:</p>

      <p>'FINE, I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO WALK' you'll no longer be saying when you get this smartwatch. Counting steps, tracking sleep, all manner of things will be happening before you know it.</p>

      <p>For $25 you can be playing along with games, asking celebrity heights and turning things on and off with your voice in an instant. Google Assistant is pretty accurate at hearing you too, so no more 'NO, I SAID SET TIMER, NOT LONE DINER' directed at an inanimate object.</p>
