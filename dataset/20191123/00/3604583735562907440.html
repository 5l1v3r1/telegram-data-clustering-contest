      <p>A Sebastopol man will fight an allegation he was the owner of an unregistered homemade handgun, which was located on his kitchen bench with a spent shell inside, along with ammunition.</p>
      <p>Kye Fulton fronted the Ballarat Magistrates Court on Thursday for a contested mention over the 2018 incident.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old sought a sentence indication on five charges, including possessing an unregistered handgun, possessing ammunition, failing to answer bail and possessing methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Police prosecutor Sergeant Aimee Heal said police searched the accused's Sebastopol home on October 9, 2018, where they uncovered a homemade unregistered handgun with a spent shell inside and ammunition on the kitchen bench.</p>
      <p>She said after a safety and evidentiary search on Fulton, police found a zip lock bag containing methamphetamine in his wallet, which was in his pocket.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Heal said Fulton did not have a gun licence. He was arrested and transported to the Ballarat Police Station where he made a no comment interview.</p>
      <p>The concreter was bailed to appear at the Ballarat Magistrates Court on February 7, but he allegedly failed to appear.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyer David Tamanika said the firearm charges were in dispute because his client did not know the gun was there.</p>
      <p>He said the Sebastopol property, which Fulton owned, was being used as a drop-in centre by his brother and his brother's friend.</p>
      <p>Mr Tamanika said Fulton had briefly called into the house the day police arrived and the names of Fulton's brother and his friend were also on the police search warrant.</p>
      <p>"He said he had no knowledge of the item on the bench," Mr Tamanika said.</p>
      <p>"It's a difficult one, Your Honour. He is concerned about prison, he's never been there before. He is 28 and may not cope well in custody."</p>
      <p>Mr Tamanika urged the court to consider a non-custodial sentence if Fulton pleaded guilty.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Michelle Mykytowycz reminded Fulton he would be admitting he owned the gun if he accepted her sentence indication.</p>
      <p>She said the alleged crime warranted an immediate term of imprisonment.</p>
      <p>"This is one where there has been firing in the community because it had a spent shell in it and there was ammunition nearby," Ms Mykytowcycz said.</p>
      <p>"On this sentence indication, it would be a term of imprisonment."</p>
      <p>Fulton rejected the sentence indication and his case was adjourned to another contested mention at the Ballarat Magistrates Court on January 15.</p>
