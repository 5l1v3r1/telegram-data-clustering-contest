      <p>According to agent Carol Foderick, it was the 45-foot-by-132-foot lot beneath this three-bedroom bungalow that was the main attraction for most of the 30-odd potential buyers who visited in September with an eye toward rebuilding.</p>
      <p>“At any given time, there are other bungalows on similar size lots or larger lots [up for sale],” Ms. Foderick said.</p>
      <p>“We took the strategy of pricing it close to where market value might be and left us some room to negotiate, which is exactly what happened.”</p>
      <h4>What they got</h4>

      <p>This nearly 1,200-square-foot bungalow with a brick façade and an attached garage has a more contemporary look and layout inside. The living and dining areas are open concept and the adjacent kitchen features hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances and a skylight.</p>
      <p>At the end of the main hall, one bedroom connects to a family room and a screened-in porch with an exit to the south-facing backyard.</p>

      <p>“The house was nicely renovated on the main floor and quite livable,” Ms. Foderick said.</p>
      <p>“The family room and screened-in porch were done after the fact, which makes it a little more appealing than a standard bungalow because the footprint already exists to potentially increase the square footage of a rebuild.”</p>
      <p>The property’s family and pedestrian-friendly locale also promises long-term appeal. “It’s in close proximity to the subway station and all the shopping amenities on Yonge Street,” Ms. Foderick said.</p>
