      <p>Three of six persons shot at Pai Kantanka, a farming community in the Oti Region have been confirmed dead.</p>
      <p>The clashes are resultant of a decade of chieftancy dispute. A local reporter, Nana Agyeman who confirmed the news to ghanaweb narrated that gunmen stormed the house of Nana Diawuo Bediako II, Chief of Pai Kantanka, and shot sporadically.</p>
      <p>The other three persons who were shot are in critical condition and have since been rushed to the Worawora government hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>The incident follows an earlier one where the Gyaasehene, Nana Annor ABabio was shot in his farm by unknown assailants.</p>
      <p>The suspects were released after initial arrests by the homicide department of the Ghana Police Service.</p>
