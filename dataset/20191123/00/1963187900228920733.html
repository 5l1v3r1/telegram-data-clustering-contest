"So the partnership between both countries is important to help the British side to enter the African markets." <br/><br/>"We have a service and industrial companies that have a lack of experience and previous work and the British side can offer that to get a win-win situation," he stated. <br/><br/>The Executive Director of BEBA Nadia Lamloum, who also participated in the seminar, said that the mission also focuses on services besides companies investments as education sector, noting that this sector is important to Egypt so there will be a connection with the British Universities. <br/><br/>Regarding BEBA's mission to Britain that will take place by the end of November, Nosseifsaid that it will include around 40 businessmen, in addition to Ministers of Investment, Transportation, and Finance, as well as the head of Suez Canal Economic Zone Yehia Zaki. <br/><br/>The mission will focus on sectors of Transportation, Health, Education, and Financial service. <br/><br/>Head of Suez Canal Economic Zone Yehia Zaki will announce available opportunities for investment in SCZone and contact with investors and companies to know their needs, according to Nossair. <br/><br/>Related to Transportation, Chairman of BEBA stated that Britain has successful programs in transportation system whether via land or sea, so Egypt can get benefit from this through the knowhow methodology. <br/><br/>The mission will also have a visit to Coventry University in United Kingdom, as to review the success story of having one of its branches now in Egypt. <br/><br/>The official opening of Coventry University's The Knowledge Hub (TKH) took place in Sep. 22 in Cairo’s New Administrative Capital.
