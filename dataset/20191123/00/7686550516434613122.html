      <p>Cardiff Sixth Form makes its debut in the guide this year and is not only named school of the year for the region but also ranking top of the table thanks to 99.2% A-level A*-B grades and 83.9% GCSE A*-A grades this summer.</p>
      <p>Alastair McCall, editor of Parent Power, said: “The absence of Cardiff Sixth Form College from the annual Sunday Times rankings has always been something of an anomaly. Long-term outstanding achievement at A-level is backed up this year by strength at GCSE following the introduction of one-year courses at this level, which allow us to include the college in our A-level/GCSE rankings for the first time.</p>
      <p>“No sixth formers in the UK achieve more highly than those at Cardiff Sixth Form College, a tribute to both the dedication of the teaching staff and the commitment and the raw talent of the students themselves. The college is head and shoulders above all of its rivals and its appeal to students from across the globe is easy to understand.”</p>
