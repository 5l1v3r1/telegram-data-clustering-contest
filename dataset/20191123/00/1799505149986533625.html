      <p>LOS ANGELES (CN) – A 13-year-old student who threatened to carry out a shooting at his South Los Angeles middle school had a list with the names of students and staff, a hand-drawn map of his school and an AR-15 assault rifle at his home when he was arrested, police said Friday.</p>
      <p>The unidentified student also had 100 rounds of ammunition, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said Friday.</p>
      <p>Several students said they overheard the suspect make threats Thursday in which he said he would carry out a shooting at Ánimo Mae Jemison Charter Middle School in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Willowbrook.</p>
      <p>Students reported the threat and administrators contacted the sheriff’s department. Police interviewed students and other witnesses and then served a search warrant at the student’s home, according to LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva.</p>
      <p>An AR-15 rifle with high capacity magazine was found along with the hand drawn map and a list of the names of students and staff members. The unregistered gun has a serial number, but investigators are trying to determine its origin, said Villanueva.</p>
      <p>“In this case the fact that people stepped forward and said what they heard led to us to prevent a tragedy today,” said Villanueva. “Kudos to staff and students today.”</p>
      <p>Investigators are still interviewing witnesses and those whose names were on the list, according to Detective Robert Dean.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to treat every threat with the utmost serious of nature,” said Dean.</p>
      <p>The threat comes a week after a student at an LA County high school shot five of his classmates with a handgun before turning the gun on himself. Nathaniel Tennosuke Berhow, 16, shot his classmates at Saugus High School with an unregistered <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ghost-gun-used-in-deadly-la-area-high-school-shooting-police-say/">“ghost gun”</a> assembled from separate gun parts, killing two and wounding three others. Police also found several other guns at his home with some registered to Berhow’s late father.</p>
      <p>Police have not determined a motive.</p>
