      <p>CHICAGO (AP) - A planned one-day strike by some 2,200 nurses at the University of Chicago Medical Center has been called off after their union reached an agreement with the hospital.</p>
      <p>The Chicago Tribune reports that the agreement between the 618-bed hospital and the nurses who have been without a contract since April was reached on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>The union had planned to strike on Tuesday and the hospital had said it would lock the nurses out for another four days to guarantee replacement nurses a certain amount of work.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>That’s what happened in September when a one-day strike by nurses was followed by a four-day lockout. The nurses had been seeking lower nurse-to-patient ratios but the terms of the agreement were not immediately made available.</p>
