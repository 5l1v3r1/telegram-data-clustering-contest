      <p>EUGENE, Ore. (AP) - Anthony Mathis had another big shooting night to help No. 11 Oregon get another big win.</p>
      <p>Mathis shot 5 for 9 on 3-pointers to finish with 18 points and the Ducks followed along for a 78-66 victory over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“Got a lot of good looks,” Mathis said. “Once again my teammates were doing a great job of finding me when I am open.”</p>
      <p>Mathis, a graduate transfer from New Mexico who entered making 68.2% from beyond the arc, helped the Ducks shoot 10 for 20 on 3s and 54% overall.</p>
      <p>“We knew Anthony was a pretty good shooter and the guys are looking for him,” Oregon coach Dana Altman said.</p>

      <p>Payton Pritchard added 16 points and five assists for the Ducks (5-0), while Francis Okoro scored 12. Oregon had 17 assists on 26 field goals.</p>
      <p>“The ball movement was good and we had pretty good looks,” Altman said. “I liked the shots we got from (3-point range).”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> coach Kelvin Sampson had a lot of praise for Pritchard.</p>
      <p>“The strength of Oregon’s team is their senior point guard,” Sampson said. “He’s in complete control of every facet of their game … he is a tremendous, tremendous college point guard.</p>

        <p>“He’s why Oregon is going to be good this year.”</p>
        <p>Caleb Milles led the Cougars (2-2) with 21 points.</p>
        <p>The Ducks pushed their lead to double digits for the first time at 45-35 on a three-point play by Pritchard and a 3-pointer by Mathis, prompting a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> timeout with 15:45 left.</p>
        <p>The Cougars momentarily cut it to six, but Mathis’ four-point play started a 9-0 run that extended Oregon’s lead to 56-41 with 10 minutes remaining.</p>
        <p>Oregon led 32-27 after a first half that was largely a battle between the 3-point shooting of the Ducks and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a>’s dominance on the inside. The Ducks made six of 12 3-pointers, including three during a 15-2 run that gave them a 29-24 lead.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> countered with 10 offensive rebounds in the first half, contributing to a 22-13 overall edge on the boards, and used those second-chance possessions to score 13 points. The Cougars finished with a 38-26 advantage in rebounds, grabbing 17 on the offensive end that led to 21 second-chance points.</p>
        <p>“We know one thing we’ve got to work on, the boards,” Altman said.</p>
        <p>Sampson said the Cougars “have to be good” on the boards because “we’re not a very good shooting team.”</p>
        <p>Overall, the Ducks shot 50% in the first half (12 of 24) to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a>’s 35.3% (12 of 34). The Cougars were 1 of 11 on 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a>: After winning the previous two meetings with Oregon, the Cougars lost in their first trip to Eugene.</p>
        <p>Oregon: The Ducks are 5-0 for the first time since the 2015-16 season, when they reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. But the Ducks have yet to play a game outside the state of Oregon.</p>
        <p>UP NEXT</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/houston/">Houston</a> returns home to play Houston Baptist on Tuesday and will be home for five of their next six games.</p>
        <p>Oregon begins play in the Battle 4 Atlantis on Wednesday against No. 13 Seton Hall, the second Top 25 team on the Oregon schedule after an earlier win over then-No. 13 Memphis. The Ducks could then be matched up with No. 8 Gonzaga in the semifinals of the three-day tournament.</p>
