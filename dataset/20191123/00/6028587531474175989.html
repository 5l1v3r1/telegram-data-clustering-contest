      <p>Jennifer Lopez was just nominated for best supporting female actor for her role in <i>Hustlers</i>. “The actress and singer, who has never been nominated for acting’s biggest honor, picked up a Film Independent Spirit Awards nomination on Thursday,” reports <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-lands-spirit-award-191433330.html"><i>Yahoo Entertainment</i></a><i>. </i>I am rooting for her to take home the award.</p>

      <p>Sparkle, sizzle and then disappear. That’s what happens with a lot of careers in the entertainment industry. We see people come and go. We see entertainers rise fast and fall even faster all the time. We see them scroll through on their beauty, bodies and sex all the time. And then suddenly, we never seem to see them again.</p>
      <p>This has certainly not been the case with Jennifer Lopez. Yes, she started where many others did, but she’s landed where very few ever will. Lopez is a damn good entertainer. She is a damn good artist. And she is a damn good hustler. She has demonstrated the talent, grit and determination necessary to build – literally create – an amazing career. I’ve been paying attention; what about you?</p>
      <p>Oh sure, she brought the sparkle, and she brought the sizzle; but she’s never disappeared. Instead, Jennifer Lopez parlayed it all into a very lucrative and fascinating career.</p>
      <h3>Jennifer Lopez hustled her way to the top of her field, and you can too.</h3>
      <p>In addition to her Film Independent Spirit Award nomination, Jennifer Lopez has been named <i>GQ’s</i> <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/2019-men-of-the-year-covers">2019 Icon of Year</a>, and I am totally here for it! I love many of her movies including <i>Monster-in-Law</i>, <i>Enough</i>, <i>Bordertown</i>, <i>Maid In Manhattan</i>, <i>The Wedding Planner</i> and – of course – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_dfc0iqmig"><i>Hustlers</i></a>.  I also love many of her songs too including “If You Had My Love,” “Love Don’t Cost a Thing,” “I’m Real,” “On the Floor,” “El Anillo” and “Jenny from the Block.”</p>
      <p>But it’s the versatility of her work that’s most impressive. Jennifer Lopez doesn’t let her career get stale, and she has shrewdly pushed her way to the front of the line. Here are some lessons for how she advanced her career and how you can do it too.</p>
      <h3>Bank on yourself.</h3>
      <p>“I’ve never been motivated by money. I’ve always been motivated by - I wanna be a great actress; I wanna be a great singer, a great dancer. I wanna make movies; I wanna make music. And the money came along with that,” says Jennifer Lopez in <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-hustlers-biggest-moments">this <i>GQ</i> interview</a>.</p>
      <p>Lopez goes on to say, “I do things because I love them. I didn’t get paid a whole bunch of money for ‘Hustlers.’ I did it for free and produced it. I bank on myself.”</p>
      <p>If I had a dime for every time I heard someone say, “I’m not working for free,” I’d be rich.  I don’t do much work for free either, but I have. I have definitely banked on myself. I have taken some career risks that may have never paid off in order to advance my career. Sometimes – just sometimes – you might want to consider working for free (or learning your pay to the back end) because it could work to your advantage. Lopez didn’t get paid on the front end for acting in and producing <i>Hustlers</i>. She banked on herself and left the earnings to the back end, letting everything ride on the movie’s success.</p>
      <p>What about you? <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2019/11/14/4-dirty-little-secrets-you-need-to-know-about-successful-people/#6125f0b17f91">Successful people take risks</a>. Sometimes you’ll win and sometimes you’ll lose, but never stop banking on yourself. If you don’t believe in yourself, no one else will. Invest in yourself, and realize that your next best career move might never happen if you wait on someone else to create it or offer it to you. Maybe your next best career move is dependent on what you can or will create for yourself.</p>
      <h3>Diversify your career portfolio.</h3>
      <p>My favorite two dramatic actresses in the world are Meryl Streep and Viola Davis, but the acting that Jennifer Lopez puts down in <i>Hustlers</i> has me moving her up on my favs list. She already was one of the best all-around, versatile entertainers (actress, singer and dancer), but now she is showing the kind of dramatic acting chops that are sure to take her to even greater heights!</p>
      <p>She continues to be a triple threat and a powerhouse of talent. Jennifer Lopez is so doggone good in so many different categories that she has hustled her way all the way to the top of the entertainment industry. In addition to her acting, singing and dancing, Lopez is a fashion designer and a television host, and she does it all very well. As a result, she remains relevant and is at the top of her game.</p>
      <p>Diversification is the difference maker. Lopez has used versatility to her advantage. She used change to her advantage. I recommend you do the same. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2014/01/10/are-you-ready-for-the-age-of-career-diversification/#3a8fbb3554ca">Diversify your career</a>. Be shrewd enough to advance your career by expanding your reach, trying new things and remaining open to change.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How can you go beyond your regular job?</li>
        <li>What can you add to your portfolio?</li>
        <li>What other income streams can you leverage?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Find opportunities where you can do the work you already do but in different ways or for different audiences. If you are a high-school teacher, maybe add adjunct college teaching to your plate. Or totally <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2019/11/16/never-change-careers-before-answering-these-6-questions-first/#a54873743bd4">make a career change</a> within or outside of your same industry from time to time. The point is to evaluate your talents and review your options for doing different things more often. Don’t limit yourself by staying in one lane. You have every right to explore as many different lanes as you want in this life.</p>
      <h3>Set a goal and master it.</h3>
      <p>It’s Jennifer Lopez’s work ethic, discipline and ferocious drive that impresses me most. She just keeps grinding. With little knowledge about pole dancing, she decided to take it on, and she just turned 50.</p>
      <p>Though she describes it as “one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do for a role,” Lopez didn’t shy away from the athletically challenging effort. Indeed she mastered it! She said she was feeling all kinds of pain, but she stuck with it. She was determined and disciplined enough to achieve success. While we weren’t there for the struggle, we’re here for the result. The movie did very well, in part, because Lopez mastered that pole.</p>
      <p>Develop yourself and your own career by committing to the unflattering and sometime painful work that’s required behind the scenes. If you want to achieve career success, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/terinaallen/2019/11/14/4-dirty-little-secrets-you-need-to-know-about-successful-people/#63b526047f91">you have to get your hustle on, and you have to grind</a>. If you just want the applause of others, you won’t succeed. You have to do what you do for you, even when other people don’t understand or accept it.</p>
      <h3>Great careers are created.</h3>
      <p>And so was the Google images search tool.<i> </i>Jennifer Lopez broke the internet in 2000 after showing up at the Grammy Awards in <i>the</i> dress, and she recently broke it again when she wore an <a href="https://variety.com/2019/scene/news/jennifer-lopez-green-dress-versace-show-grammys-1203343570/">updated version of the dress in 2019</a>. That doggone dress originally drummed up such a stir that everyone, and apparently everyone else that they knew, searched so hard for it online that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jennifer-lopezs-grammys-dress-inspired-google-image-search-2015-5">Google images search was created to help them find it.</a></p>
      <p>It may have all started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq1Q3Sw7jyw">the Versace dress</a>, but it didn’t end there. Lopez’s career has soared to heights that very few reach. And it wasn’t because of the dress that she’s had success. Many people wear provocative and sexy clothes and don’t become icons. Many have great looks, great bodies and all that glittery stuff, but they don’t’ create meaningful and long-lasting careers. Jennifer Lopez was able to do it because she is a true hustler. She pulled herself up and made her mark in the industry.</p>
      <h3>The wrap up.</h3>
      <p>What about you? Are you making your mark? If your current career no longer interests you, are you doing anything to create new opportunities? Consider this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do you bank on yourself? How?</li>
        <li>Do you invest in your career? How?</li>
        <li>Is your portfolio diversified enough? If not, why?</li>
        <li>What are your talents, and are you mastering anything new? If not, why?</li>
      </ul>
