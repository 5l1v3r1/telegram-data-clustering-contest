      <p>Fear gripped passers by who watched as a man who was duped of his money and mobile phone by fraudsters cursed them with eggs for luring him to give away his pocket money and mobile phone.</p>
      <p>A video circulating on social media suggests the incident happened in Kumasi in the Ashanti region.</p>
      <p>To depict the pain caused to him, the male victim who is yet to be identified called on river gods to kill the scammers together with their households.</p>
      <p>The man was attacked by some passerby who observed him as he cursed the fraudsters with some hurling stones at him.</p>
      <p>Reports say an eyewitness even went to the extent of giving the man a slap.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the abuse didnâ€™t stop the man to further curse all those who witnessed him being robbed and kept mute about it by not alerting him with the last egg in his hand.</p>
      <p>The man cursed the culprits with two eggs and declared their family not see the light of day.</p>
      <p>Being defrauded in the market has been a prevailing issue which continues to exist.</p>
