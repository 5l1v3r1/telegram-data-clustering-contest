      <p>ACT Policing is calling for witnesses and dash-cam footage following a suspicious house fire in Kambah on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>About 11.00pm, Fire &amp; Rescue and police attended a home in Chirnside Place, Kambah following reports of a house fire. Shortly after, two residents exited the house unharmed.</p>
      <p>The fire was extinguished but caused damage to the entrance and living area.</p>
      <p>Police allege that one or more people entered the home and deliberately set the premises on fire. Two vehicles at the premises also had damage unrelated to the fire.</p>
      <p>Police also believe the incident was targeted and are exploring links to outlaw motorcycle gangs.</p>
      <p>Police are urging anyone who may have any information that could assist police or dashcam footage from the Kambah area between 10.00pm and midnight on Thursday night to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000, or via the <a href="https://www.crimestoppersact.com.au/">Crime Stoppers ACT website</a>. Please quote reference 6463457. Information can be provided anonymously.</p>
