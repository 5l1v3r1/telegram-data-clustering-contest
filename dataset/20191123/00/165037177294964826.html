      <h1>Aubameyang at a loss to explain Arsenal slump</h1>

        <b>Arsenal have failed to win their past five Premier League matches and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang called for efforts to be redoubled.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</b> said <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal</a> must ask questions of themselves after<b> a 2-2 draw</b> with Southampton left them without a win in five Premier League matches.</p>
      <p><b>Alexandre Lacazette</b> twice dragged his side back on terms against a team beaten 9-0 by Leicester City at the end of October, levelling after <b>Danny Ings and James Ward-Prowse</b> put the visitors ahead.</p>
      <p>The second of Lacazette's goals - his fourth of the season in the Premier League - came <b>deep in second-half stoppage-time</b> and was met with muted celebrations around a disgruntled Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Indeed the Gunners left the field to boos and when<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-aubameyang-101801/"> Aubameyang </a>was asked whether they were deserved, <b>the Gunners' captain</b> told the club's official website: "I don't know".</p>
      <p>"When we are playing, <b>we are the first to be disappointed when it doesn't work</b>. We will try to keep fighting. I think we have the quality to come back and we have to fight".</p>
      <p>"I think everybody has to try to <b>ask themselves what they can change, </b>what they can give more of. Everybody has to do this, me first. I will try to work hard and to get back to winning ways."</p>

      <p>Aubameyang <b>captained Arsenal for the first time </b>against Southampton but his performance was very much overshadowed by that of Lacazette on a day when few Gunners players were anywhere near their best.</p>
      <p>With a Europa League clash against <b>Eintracht Frankfurt </b>next up for Unai Emery's side,<b> Aubameyang promised graft from the squad </b>as they aim to pick up a first win in seven attempts.</p>
      <p>Asked what has gone wrong at Arsenal, Aubameyang replied: "I don't know exactly. The only thing I can say is that we as a team, as players, <b>will try to continue our work".</b></p>
      <p><b>"We have to find a solution together.</b> I think we have to stay strong. We are men and we have to carry on our hard work".</p>
      <p>"We have a game on Thursday and we will start from this game to try to turn things around. In this case, it's really not easy for everybody but we are men and<b> we have to carry on to try to sort it out</b>. We are a group and we can find a solution internally. That's what we are going to do".</p>
      <p><b>"Everybody is disappointed today, the fans and the players</b>. It didn't work today. It's not a good result for us. Obviously we're playing at home and we have to win games at home. We have to keep fighting and keep trying to sort it out."</p>
