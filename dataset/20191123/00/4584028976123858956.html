      <h1>Modest Watling revels in digging in to frustrate England</h1>

      <p>BJ Watling felt knowing his limitations was key to his success after the New Zealand wicketkeeper-batsman frustrated England with an unbeaten century on day three of the first Test.</p>
      <p>The Black Caps closed on 394-6 in reply to the tourists' 353 all out at Bay Oval on Saturday, Watling unbeaten on 119 after sharing a sixth-wicket stand of 119 with Colin de Grandhomme (65).</p>
      <p>Watling punished Ben Stokes for putting down a regulation slip catch on 31 as England took just two wickets in the day at Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>Mitchell Santner (31 not out) also provided support for the gritty Watling, who enjoyed digging in for an obdurate eighth century in the longest format.</p>
      <p>"It felt great, obviously. I love scoring hundreds for New Zealand and I really enjoyed that one," said the 34-year-old.</p>
      <p>"It was hard work and we had some tough periods but we got through. It was special to get over the line and to still be there tonight, which I targeted.</p>
      <p>"I just think I'm very limited and I try to play how I know works best for me. I take a few shots away that some of the big boys do, and I definitely can't.</p>
      <p>"I try to stick to a gameplan and hopefully it pays off."</p>
      <p>Watling stressed the importance of keeping England in the field as long as possible to press home their advantage on day four.</p>
      <p>"We're expecting the surface to keep playing a few more tricks over the next couple of days so it is important for us to try and build this lead a bit and put them under some pressure when they bat," Watling added.</p>
      <p>"The least amount of runs we can chase the better. If we can get some partnerships going tomorrow there's every chance of a result our way."</p>
      <p>Rory Burns left the field after splitting the webbing in his thumb, but is expected to open in England's second innings.</p>
