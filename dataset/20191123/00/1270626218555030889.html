      <p>The death toll from Samoa's measles epidemic has risen to 20, with 202 cases recorded on Thursday this week.</p>
      <p>The Samoan government said 147 people were currently in hospital because of measles, including 11 children who were in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>Radio NZ reports the majority of them are at the main hospital in the capital, Apia.</p>
      <p>It said there had been 1,644 cases of measles recorded in the country since the outbreak started last month.</p>
      <p>The country is in a state of emergency, with schools closed, a mass vaccination campaign underway, and public gatherings restricted.</p>
      <p>Nearly 89 percent of the cases are on the main island, Upolu, and restrictions are in place on travel between the two islands, including a ban on children under the age of 19.</p>
      <p>All but one of the recorded deaths have been children; nine under the age of one, and 10 between the ages of one and four.</p>
