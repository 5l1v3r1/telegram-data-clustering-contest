      <p>Ernesto Valverde was evidently irked. He wanted to know why they, the press, always began questions to him with the words 'do you worry'.On the occasion before that, one of many in his press conference during the build-up to Saturday's limp 1-2 victory over Leganes, he was probed on Gerard Pique's extra curricular activities and whether the centre-back was in the right frame of mind and fitness to feature for FC Barcelona in the clash.</p>
      <p>‘If he is fit or not we will see later,’ answered Valverde before revealing his squad list. ‘This week I have talked with him about the things he does outside of football. Curiously, they talk about the players who do not do things outside of football, and then when they do them…I’ve talked to him about this. If I see him focused and well, he will play,’ the under-fire coach attested.</p>
      <p>But 'well' Pique, who did indeed make the cut but has been overseeing the Davis Cup tennis tournament, was not at Butarque. Not entirely at fault for the goal that put the bottom-ranked hosts ahead, it was he who was caught out by the long ball before Youssef En-Nesyri dispatched a top corner rocket from the edge of the box between he and Samuel Umtiti.</p>
      <p>Minutes later, after a poor pass back to him on the right, the centre-back slipped and allowed Oscar to almost doubled his side’s lead with a low shot that just dragged past Marc-Andre Ter-Stegen’s right post.</p>
      <p>As it turned out, goals from Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal saved the Blaugrana’s blushes but naturally, Pique, who SPORT found ‘uncomfortable’, ‘irregular’ and ‘dubious’ when handing him a mere ‘5’ mark in their player ratings, was confronted on his display and relationship with Valverde in the mixed zone.</p>
      <p>‘The relationship with the mister [Valverde] has always been phenomenal and we get along well,’ Pique insisted. ‘We talk with him everyweek and with the club. Everything is going well and it [the criticism] is more noise from outside, which I think is a little bit over the top on whether I am in Madrid or if I have dinner here or there; It's part of the circus and it's part of my job, but I try to do my best,’ said Pique.</p>
      <p>Asked further on his jaunts to Madrid, Pique replied: ‘At the end of the day, they are 40-minute trips, it's like going by car to Tarragona [Catalonia’s second-largest city]. I think there’s a lot of hype because of who I am and what I represent...People can opine whatever they want, but [they should] respect me,’ demanded the 32-year-old, before confirming that he was unsure whether he would stay in Madrid this weekend as he had on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>Yet it is not just his love of tennis that has been a concern. In other separate interviews recently, Pique has made bold claims that he sleeps only four or five days a night and, ridiculously, has an addiciton to Nutella chocolate spread. ‘It is wrong to say it because I am an elite athlete, but I will tell you that I eat half a pot every day’ were his exact words on the popular Spanish TV show <i>El Hormiguero</i>.</p>
      <p>This week in Mundo Deportivo, he was forced to clarify such outlandish confessions to the daily newspaper and even if he was exaggerating for laughs, something is clearly off.</p>
      <p>Often susceptible to the long ball over the top as mentioned, he is a yard off the pace, and easy to catch off guard. Perhaps his suspension for Wednesday’s encounter with Dortmund in the Champions League, a must-win, is a blessing in disguise.</p>
      <p>After all, with the David Cup finishing on Sunday, he’ll be able to catch 40 winks for yet another trip to the Spanish capital. This time for the day job, though, when Barça face Atletico at the Wanda and he will need to be at the top of his game.</p>
