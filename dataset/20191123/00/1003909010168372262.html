      <p>Pre-lung transplant patient Drew Brabbins ensures he remains on the move.</p>
      <p>For most people, getting to the gym five times a week is an ambitious goal.</p>
      <p>But for Drew Brabbins, it’s non-negotiable.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old spends every weekday morning working out alongside other people with lung conditions at the GF MacDonald Centre for Lung Health in Edmonton.</p>
      <p>“This is a place where I can go to work out, get to know people, talk to people who have maybe not the same problems that I have, but are dealing with the same issues,” said Brabbins from his Sherwood Park home. “Everyone is on oxygen, so you go there and that’s normal.”</p>
      <p>Brabbins was diagnosed with asbestosis from an unknown exposure at age 38; he developed emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder as a result. For more than two years, he has been on the lung transplant list.</p>
      <p>Once an active individual who played all kinds of sports, Brabbins still ensures he works on his fitness. He says it has not only helped his mental health, but is also increasing his chances of a transplant being successful when lungs become available.</p>
      <p>“It’s so important,” Brabbins said. “Just getting off the couch in the morning helps.”</p>
      <p>Using oxygen 24 hours per day, Brabbins’ time outdoors is limited in cold, smoky or rainy weather. He misses spending time outside with his grandchildren, as he “watches the world from the window.”</p>
      <p>Now, with five other patients he met in a pre-habilitation course (they call themselves the Group of Six), Brabbins speaks to other patients awaiting transplants and highlights the benefits he’s achieved by focusing on fitness.</p>
      <p>Brabbins and his wife Bonnie also hope that by educating children about the importance of organ donation while they are still in school, it will lead to an increase in donor numbers, as the students grow into adults, and to a decrease in the stigma that sometimes surrounds organ donation.</p>
      <p>“Kids are the ones that are more receptive to hearing this stuff than the 25-year-olds who think they are bulletproof and don’t want to hear about their mortality,” he said.</p>
      <p>Brabbins thinks the mental toll waiting for “Christmas” — the word he uses to describe that day when he will get that call to tell him a donor match has been found — would be even more difficult to manage without focusing on what he can do for himself and others in similar situations in the present.</p>
      <p>“I’m not waiting for tomorrow, but I’m hoping for tomorrow,” he said. “You just need to get through each day and eventually Christmas will come.”</p>
