      <h1>Here’s when Takealot’s Black Friday 2019 deals will go live</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Takealot has published a guide outlining when its 2019 Black Friday deals will go live.</p>
      <p>As in previous years, the group said that it will be hosting a Blue Dot sale running over the entire weekend.</p>
      <p>However, for the first time it will be giving shoppers exclusive early access to some of its Black Friday deals starting on the <b>24 November</b>.</p>
      <p>The group said that these early-access deals will be heavily discounted and will <b>not see further price cuts</b> when the actual Black Friday sale starts.</p>
      <p>It added that new deals will be posted at the following times over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>00h01 on Friday (29 November) – All deals unlocked</li>
        <li>06h00 on Saturday (30 November) – More deals added</li>
        <li>06h00 on Sunday (1 December) – More deals added</li>
        <li>06h00 on Monday (2 December) – Cyber Monday tech deals</li>
        <li>06h00 on Tuesday (3 December) – Takealot Tuesday deals</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The group also announced that it would be extending the trading hours at pick-up points around the country as follows:</p>

      <p>Takealot chief executive officer Kim Reid said that this year he is anticipating the biggest Black Friday yet, a culmination of months of tech and operational business-wide focus to prepare for increased predicted traffic and shopper volumes.</p>
      <p>Takealot’s Black Friday gross merchandise value (GMV) grew 125% from 2017 to 2018, with orders up 127%. Superbalist’s Black Friday GMV has grown on average around 50%.</p>
      <p>Reid said throughout the year they have been working to scale operations across multiple areas within the business.</p>
      <p>“After expanding our Johannesburg distribution centre (DC), our warehouse storage space now stands at 75,000m square. We house over 3.7 million items at any given time, and have opened 47 Takealot Pickup Points in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, Kwa-Zulu Natal, Limpopo, Free State and Mpumalanga for order collections and returns, with more to open in the coming months.”</p>
      <p>The Takealot group anticipates they’ll travel over 4 million km from Black Friday until 24 December. “To put that in context, it is the equivalent of circumnavigating the globe over 100 times” said Reid.</p>
