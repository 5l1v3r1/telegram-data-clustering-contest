      <p>Young adults are being urged by under-18s and celebrities to sign up to vote so they can use the power of the ballot box to tackle the climate and nature crises.</p>
      <p>The call comes after the Electoral Commission reveals that a third of young people are not registered to vote, with only 66% of 18 to 19-year-olds and 68% of those aged 20-24 correctly signed up.</p>
      <p>Students who are too young to vote are helping launch #ItsOurTime, a politically neutral campaign which aims to motivate young people concerned about climate change to sign up before the registration deadline on November 26.</p>
      <p>Celebrities including bands The Foals and The Editors, Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo, and actor Alex Lawther have also been urging fans and followers to register as part of the campaign.</p>

      <p>YouTube star Jack Harries said there were millions of young people across the country who were concerned about climate change but were not registered to vote.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been told we only have 11 years to radically transform our society to tackle climate change and whoever gets into power will be there for 5 years.</p>
      <p>“So this is the climate election. If you’re 18 or over and not yet registered to vote, please consider doing so because all of our futures rely on it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Under-18s from the Birmingham Student Climate Network (SCN) are taking to the streets this weekend to demand action on rising temperatures and encourage those old enough to register.</p>
      <p>More than 300 flower pots with seedlings will create a “guerrilla” garden in the city centre, spelling out “Act Now” and labelled with pleas from the youngsters that the future is in adults’ hands and they should register to vote.</p>

      <p>Aaron Smith, 17, from Birmingham Student Climate Network said: “I want to live in a world where I can breathe clean air and enjoy wildlife in my back garden.</p>
      <p>“t’s my future that’s on the line. That’s why I’m calling on everyone to register to vote now so that they can decide what my future holds.”</p>
      <p>Erin Curtis, 16, from Scottish Youth Climate Strike, said: “The climate crisis is the single biggest issue facing our society, and time is running out to do something about it.</p>
      <p>“The politicians we elect today have the power to take action in order to protect tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“At my age I don’t get a say in UK elections, but I strongly urge anyone over 18 to register to vote. You have the power to change the status quo, and I really hope you use it.”</p>
