      <p>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) - Taking a cue from Uber and Amazon, two Maine heating oil distributors are stepping up their game by letting consumers order quickly from their phones.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/portland-press/">Portland Press</a> Herald reports that the first company was Heatable, which is owned by Dead River Co., followed by <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/order-oil-online/">Order Oil Online</a>. Both distribute in southern Maine.</p>
      <p>Both Heatable and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/order-oil-online/">Order Oil Online</a> are aimed at people who are looking for the lowest prices and quick delivery - not furnace repairs or maintenance.</p>
      <p>David Simmons, the crew leader of Heatable, said the company serves as a “disruptor” in the marketplace by resetting customer expectations.</p>
