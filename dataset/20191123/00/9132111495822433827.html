      <p>The National Identification Authority (NIA) has extended the Ghana card registration exercise in five regions by one week.</p>
      <p>These regions are the Ahafo, Bono, Bono East, Upper East and Upper West.</p>
      <p>The exercise which was scheduled to end in the above regions today (November 23, 2019) will now be completed on Saturday, November 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>A statement from NIA and signed by its Communications Director, ACI Francis Pamdetti urged prospective applicants to take advantage of the extension period to get registered.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Registration challenges</b>
      </p>
      <p>Many prospective applicants faced several difficulties in their quest to register for the Ghana card in the region including network challenges, frequent breakdown of machines, long queues among others.</p>
      <p>The executives of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) have raised concerns and filed complaints at the National Identification Authority (NIA) for explanations with regards to the hindrances.</p>
      <p>They also demanded an extension of the exercise.</p>
      <p>NDC’s National Director of Elections, Elvis Afriyie Ankrah at a press conference on the matter alleged that the challenges were a deliberate ploy by the NIA and the government to prevent people from registering.</p>
      <p>Here is the full release:</p>
      <p>EXTENSION OF MASS REGISTRATION EXERCISE IN UPPER EAST, UPPER WEST, BONO, AHAFO AND BONO EAST REGIONS.</p>
      <p>DURATION: Saturday 23rd November to Saturday 30th November 2019.</p>
      <p>The general public should kindly take note of the following:</p>
      <p>1. All registration Centre’s in the said regions will continue to register applicants till Saturday 30th November 2019.</p>
      <p>2. All prospective applicants are entreated to take advantage of the extension period to get registered.</p>
      <p>3. For the avoidance of doubt, the NIA does not charge a fee for registration and issuance of the Ghana card. Therefore any demand for fee payment at the registration centre is criminal. In addition, the NIA DOES NOT sell ID card holders/cases to applicants who have been issued with the Ghana Card. Any such sale is unauthorized by the NIA.</p>
      <p>4. The NIA will very soon operate registration centres at offices of cognate institution’s such as NHIA, SSNIT and DVLA. Permanent NIA Ofiices will also be established at the Regional, Municipal and District levels by March 2020 to afford all Ghanaians who were not registered during the mass registration exercise the opportunity to get registered.</p>
