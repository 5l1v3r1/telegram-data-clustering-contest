      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">George Ogbolu</a></address>
      <p>Some state chairmen of the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/22/details-of-what-apc-discussed-at-its-national-caucus-meeting-emerges/"><u><b>All Progressives Congress (APC)</b></u></a> have called on the national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, to resign.</p>
      <p>They made the call at the National Caucus meeting of the party chaired by President <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/president-buhari-storms-out-of-apc-nec-meeting/"><u><b>Muhammadu Buhari</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the party was held on Friday at the national secretariat of the APC in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Speaking to newsmen, the spokesperson of the aggrieved members and chairman of the Zamfara APC, Lawal Lawani said Oshiomhole should leave office, insisting that his leadership had divided the party.</p>
      <p>Other aggrieved APC chairmen, who endorsed the statement, are: Arc. Bala Kangiwa (Kebbi), Habibi Sara (Jigawa), Ade Adetimeli (Ondo), Abdullahi Abbas (Kano), Abba Yaro (Benue), Omotosin Paul (Ekiti), Mohammed Jibril Iman, (Niger), Anslem Ojezua (Edo), Philips Shekwo (Nasarawa) Rtd Air Com Ikeda (Kaduna) Lakep Dabah (Plateau) Shitu Shitu (Katsina) Isah Sadiq (Sokoto).</p>
      <p>A statement Lawani read noted: <i>“Most of the goodwill acquired by the Party, by reasons of its religious adherence to the provisions of its Constitution and the tenets of internal democratic practices has taken a downturn, principally due to dictatorial and despotic tendencies of the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who has usurped the powers of the National Executive Committee of the party.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“This may have been responsible for the admonition of Mr President who insisted that the Party Organs, at the State, LGA and Ward levels, must be strengthened and accorded due respect with regard to the powers and responsibilities conferred on them by the Constitution of the Party.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Most, unfortunately, the facade conducted by the National Chairman, today, the 22nd of November, 2019, as a National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting, leaves much to be desired.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“He completely ignored Mr President advice and rather defied all known rules for meetings by precluding contributions from members and ending the meeting abruptly, without achieving anything. This is most unfortunate and undesirable.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Arising from the foregoing and having regards to the huge responsibilities bestowed on us as officers of the party and in the overriding interest of our members, we’re left with no option but to demand that Comrade Adams Oshiomhole resigns his position as National Chairman, in other to stem the slide and provide an enabling environment for genuine healing, reconciliation and practice of true democracy within the party across the country”.</i>
