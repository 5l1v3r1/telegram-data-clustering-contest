      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 23 ― Music industry mogul Scooter Braun said yesterday his dispute with megastar Taylor Swift over her music catalogue has left his family receiving “death threats.”</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old pop artist famous for hits like <i>Shake</i> <i>It</i> <i>Off</i> began publicly sparring with Braun this summer over his company's purchase of her former label, Big Machine Label Group, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.</p>
      <p>Last week, Swift ― known for her calculating social media strategy ― said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were “exercising tyrannical control,” claiming they were preventing her from performing at an upcoming awards gala and releasing a Netflix documentary including songs from her early catalogue.</p>
      <p>In the post she pleaded with her fans and fellow artists to back her cause.</p>
      <p>Braun had not publicly spoken out on the matter, but early yesterday dropped a lengthy Instagram post saying Swift's appeal had resulted in “numerous death threats directed at my family.”</p>
      <p>“I assume this was not your intention but it is important that you understand that your words carry a tremendous amount of weight,” Braun wrote.</p>
      <p>“While disappointed that you have remained silent after being notified by your attorney 4 days ago of these ongoing threats, I'm still hopeful that we can fix this.”</p>
      <p>Swift has not responded publicly to Braun's post.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Big Machine had said it would allow Swift to perform some of her early hits at the American Music Awards on Sunday. ― AFP</p>
