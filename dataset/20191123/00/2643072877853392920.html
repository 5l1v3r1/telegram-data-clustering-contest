      <p>Recall that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Saturday, November 30, for the conduct of the Kogi West supplementary rerun election.</p>
      <p>INEC had declared the Kogi West Senatorial Rerun inconclusive.</p>
      <p>The senatorial election which was held last Saturday, November 16, 20019, was contested by twenty-four candidate with the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), <b>Dino Melaye</b> and <b>Smart Adeyemi</b> of the All Progressives Congress (APC) leading as the major candidates.</p>
      <p>This online platform reports that the election was marred by <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/kogi-2019-thugs-attack-dino-melayes-polling-unit/"><u>violence and ballot box snatching</u></a>.</p>
      <p>Announcing results, the returning officer of the election, Olayinde Lawal, said the margin between the two leading candidates is lesser than the cancelled votes.</p>
      <p>Lawal said while Adeyemi polled a total of 80,118 votes, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/16/kogi-2019-election-dino-melaye-casts-his-vote/"><u><b>Dino Melaye</b></u></a> had 59,548, leaving a margin of 20,570.</p>
      <p>He said 43,127 votes were cancelled across the seven LGAs where the election held.</p>
      <p>Dino Melaye may already have carved a new career path for himself by joining Nollywood, with the movie set to premiere on December 12, 2019 at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Melaye co-stars with Kunle Remi, Joy Idoko, Ayoola Ayobami, Linda Osifo, Mofe Duncan, Real Warri Pikin, Chioma Idigo, Sean King, among others.</p>
