      <h4>Cats were considered sacred by the ancient Egyptians so it was unsurprising that the discovery of mummies included so many felines. Lion cubs, however, are a much rarer find.</h4>
      <p>Egypt unveiled a collection on Saturday of 75 wooden and bronze statues, as well as lion cub mummies decorated with hieroglyphics.</p>
      <p>The unveiling took place at the Saqqara necropolis near the Giza pyramids in southern Cairo and also included mummified remains of crocodiles, snakes, birds and cats.</p>

      <p>Antiquities Minister Khaled El-Enany described the discovery as "a [whole] museum by itself."</p>

      <p>Enany added that the trove belongs to the 26th Dynasty, which dates back to the 7th century BC.</p>
      <p>Archaeologists often find cats in mummy form as they were considered sacred animals by ancient Egyptians but the recovery of a lion in the same state is unusual. Indeed, the first lion skeleton was discovered in Saqqara in 2004.</p>
