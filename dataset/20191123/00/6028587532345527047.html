      <p>Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), the flag carrier of Sweden and one of the dominant carriers in Northern Europe, is planning to launch a series of transatlantic flights on narrowbody aircraft.The new service comes as a product of new Airbus A321LR aircraft on order for the Swedish air carrier. Billed as an ultra-efficient, single aisle aircraft, several carriers have been attracted to the new A321LR because of its ability to take on some longer haul routes – including several over the Atlantic ocean.</p>
      <p>In April of this year, for example, JetBlue <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/geoffwhitmore/2019/04/17/jetblue-flights-are-coming-to-london/#7c9eb8811cc0">made headlines</a> by announcing that it would start operating international flights from the New York City and Boston to London on its to-be-delivered A321LRs. TAP, the flag carrier of Portugal, <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/tap-portugals-first-a321lr-could-mark-the-beginning-of-more-cramped-transatlantic-flights/">announced similar plans in January</a> while other carriers are also mulling the long haul utility of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>SAS is following a similar tack with its own A321LR fleet. Initially, the carrier plans to receive its first aircraft in September of 2020. That aircraft will be assigned to regular service between Copenhagen, Denmark and Boston, Massachusetts. With the rest of the carrier’s orders, other routes between Europe and the Eastern United States will be considered.</p>
      <p>Use of the A321 on a route of this type is a big departure from historical norms. Right now, most transatlantic carriers fly widebody aircraft with two rows over the ocean; models like the Boeing 777 and the Airbus 330 have a longer range than their narrowbody cousins and are often better equipped with galleys and cabins to serve those routes. One exception is the Boeing 757, which is a larger single aisle aircraft; several carriers operate special versions of the 757 across short, transatlantic journeys.</p>
      <p>By contrast, the A321 has typically been used to fly domestic routes, albeit of the longer variety. American Airlines, for example, operates a fleet of Airbus A321Ts on transcontinental routes between New York City and San Francisco/Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Now, with performance improvements only built into the A321LR (or Long Range), the Airbus workhorse is ready to take on wider ranging flights.</p>
      <p>Even if the A321LR may be ready for transoceanic flight, what’s less certain is whether air carriers will be able to create a comfortable experience for the long haul flight. One advantage of widebody aircraft has traditionally been that the airframe has enough space to accommodate extra galleys, bathrooms and luggage, an important factor when considering long haul flight. The larger cabins on a widebody aircraft also accommodate a wide range of cabin styles (such as the lavish business class cabins common on today’s commercial airline) and are often more quiet than narrowbodies.</p>
      <p>It’s still unknown whether the widebody experience will be identically replicated in the SAS A321LR coming to market in 2020, but what is clear is that the internal cabin experience will be close. Already, SAS has committed to a three-cabin interior with 22 business class, 12 premium economy and 123 economy seats (compared to 32 business class, 56 premium economy and 174 economy seats on an SAS A330). If SAS can pull off a premium, international experience in a smaller, narrowbody aircraft without crews or passengers getting congested, it could tap into some serious savings by operating the aircraft.</p>
