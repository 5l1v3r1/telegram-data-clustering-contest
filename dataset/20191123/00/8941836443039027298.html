      <p>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - The medical examiner in Maine has changed a finding that alcoholism played a role in the death of a Massachusetts man who died while hiking the Appalachian Trail.</p>
      <p>Chief medical examiner Mark Flomenbaum’s office has issued an updated autopsy report to the widow of 63-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-aylward/">Jeff Aylward</a>. The Maine Warden Service found <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-aylward/">Aylward</a> dead near his tent in western Maine in August.</p>
      <p>The Bangor Daily News reports Flomenbaum’s office originally attributed <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-aylward/">Aylward</a>’s death to a heart condition spurred by diabetes, with alcoholism as a contributing factor. The updated report provided to Ann Aylward on Friday removes the finding that alcoholism played a role.</p>

        <p>Ann Aylward says she’s “so glad that I can put <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jeff-aylward/">Jeff</a> to rest and put him to rest in the true light of who he is.”</p>
