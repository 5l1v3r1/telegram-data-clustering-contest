      <p>The Cubs have quietly been rearranging their front office and organizational structures in an effort to create a farm system that better develops its players and an overall environment that fosters better pitching.As a part of that, they announced on Friday that they had hired Casey Jacobson, formerly of Washington based pitching think-tank Driveline Baseball to serve as their coordinator of pitching development. This came ten days after they hired Dan Kantrovitz to be their director of scouting. Kantrovitz had previously worked in the Cardinals and Athletics organizations and helped oversee drafts that built the healthy farm systems in both places.</p>
      <p>And most recently, the Cubs traded cash considerations to Oakland for pitcher Jharel Cotton. The team announced the move via press release early Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Cotton spent 2012-2016 in the Dodgers farm system and was a part of the August 2016 trade that sent Rich Hill to Los Angeles. Cotton pitched in the majors for the Athletics in 2016 and 2017 before a UCL strain shelved him for 2018 and eventual Tommy John surgery kept Cotton out until he could rehab in the minor leagues late in the 2019 season.</p>
      <p>He is the type of pitcher that the Cubs have turned to in the past: A former top prospect with a live arm derailed by injury. Cotton was the 14th ranked prospect in the Oakland system when he debuted in September 2016, and during his rookie season all three of his offspeed pitches generated healthy whiff rates.</p>
      <p>While rehabbing with Triple-A Las Vegas this year, Cotton gave up 16 earned runs and struck out 24 batters in 18.2 innings. He made three starts in 18 appearances in all, including four outings with High-A Stockton in the California League.</p>
      <p>The Cubs likely see this is a high-reward gamble and one that if it works can help their flagging bullpen significantly. The Chicago reliever corps blew 28 saves in 2019, only two behind league-worst Oakland.</p>
      <p>If Cotton is able to fully return from Tommy John surgery, he could fill a few different roles for the Cubs. He has experience as a starter and can come out of the bullpen in long relief, but his high strikeout rate might also lend itself well to the high-leverage innings late in games, too.</p>
      <p>As they work to improve their relief pitching this offseason, the Cubs have also expressed interest in bringing Brandon Morrow back on a minor-league deal, who could complement current closer Craig Kimbrel nicely. Morrow joined the Cubs as a free agent two winters ago on a two-year, $21 million deal but couldnâ€™t pitch after July 2018 thanks to injury. If he can return, Chicago could rebuild its bullpen relatively easily and inexpensively, depending on what role Cotton might take.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the Cubs are in position where they have to work creatively to address the problems that kept them to a wild-card berth in 2018 and September postseason elimination this year. Their current payroll obligations for 2020 are about $10 million below the luxury tax threshold, so major changes to the roster via free agency are not as much of an option as years past.</p>
      <p>The Cubs have made big splashes during the winter in almost each of the last four offseasons, but they were relatively quiet in winter 2018-2019 and will probably stick to moves like trading for Cotton this time around.</p>
