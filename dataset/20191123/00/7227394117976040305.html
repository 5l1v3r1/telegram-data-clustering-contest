      <h1>OnePlus security breach exposes customer names, emails, phone numbers, and addresses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=25" target="_blank">Vlad</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus has revealed today that its systems have been breached, resulting in information about certain orders having been exposed. Names, contact numbers, emails, and shipping addresses could be in the possession of nefarious third parties.</p>
      <p>The company stresses that only a subset of orders have had these details exposed. Additionally, OnePlus says all payment information, passwords, and accounts are safe. That's in stark contrast to <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_finds_evidence_that_credit_card_info_was_stolen-news-29238.php">last year's breach</a>, which even exposed the bank card details for some customers.</p>

      <p>OnePlus discovered this while its security team was monitoring its systems. The company immediately took steps to stop the intruder and reinforce security, and also made sure that there aren't any similar vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited.</p>
      <p>All of the impacted users have been notified by email. So if you have received an email from OnePlus today, detailing the breach, then you are affected. Otherwise, you aren't. Either way, there is no additional action required on your part, but if your order details got stolen, then you may receive spam and phishing emails as a result of this incident. OnePlus is working with the relevant authorities to further investigate.</p>
