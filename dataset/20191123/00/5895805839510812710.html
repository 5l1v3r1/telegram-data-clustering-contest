      <p>Imagine a scenario in which a train is careening down a track, threatening to run into a group of five people. You see this happening and have to decide whether you would pull a lever to divert the train to another track, where one individual would likely be struck by the train, or leave it be. In other words, you're faced with the decision to "actively" cause harm to one person or "passively" cause harm to five people.</p>
      <p>This hypothetical scenario, called the "trolley problem," is used widely in moral psychology experiments. Psychologists find that most people, but not all, choose to divert the train.</p>
      <p>New research forthcoming in the journal <i>Frontiers in Psychology</i> examined variations of the trolley problem in a sample of young children. Specifically, a team of German psychologists led by Niklas Dworazik wanted to see if children would respond to moral dilemmas in a manner consistent with their mothers.</p>
      <p>They found that they did. Dworazik and his team state, "There is a large scientific interest in human moral judgments. However, little is known about the developmental origins and the specific role of the primary caregivers in the early development of inter-individual differences in human <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/ethics-and-morality">morality</a>. [...] The present findings provide the first evidence that children’s moral intuitions are closely associated with the moral intuitions of their mother."</p>
      <p>To arrive at this conclusion, the researchers recruited 56 children and their mothers to participate in a short in-person experiment. In the experiment, the researchers asked children (ages 3 to 6) and their mothers to respond to five moral dilemmas, listed below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A ball is rolling down a hill and threatening a group of five children. You can redirect the ball and thereby save the group from the collision but will hurt one single child.</li>
        <li>A single child is threatened by the ball. You can shove the child out of the ball’s way and thereby save the child from getting hurt badly, but the child will still get hurt slightly.</li>
        <li>A ball is about to crash into a pile of toys. The only way to save the toys is to redirect the ball, where a single child would get hurt by the collision with the ball.</li>
        <li>A ball is threatening a group of five children. The only chance to save the five children is to shove a child with a big backpack in its way. Thereby that child clashes with the ball and stops it but gets hurt at the same time.</li>
        <li>A ball is threatening a group of five children. The only way to save the five children is to activate a trapdoor by remote through which the child with the backpack falls into the ball.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For each scenario, children answered whether an onlooker should redirect the ball or do nothing. Mothers also responded to the five scenarios.</p>
      <p>The researchers then tested to see if there was an increase in response consistency among mother-child pairs. They found that there was. They write, "Overall, our data show a strong correspondence of maternal judgments on those of their children. [...] The specific mother-child-dyad agreed to a much higher degree (71.1%) than randomly assigned mother-child-dyads (57.5%)."</p>
      <p>A question for future research is why children tended to judge moral dilemmas like their mothers. The researchers speculate that both socialization and genetic factors play a role. They write, "For future research, it would be valuable to investigate how moral values may be socialized, for example by looking at mother-child interactions when discussing moral dilemmas together. It would also be valuable to [...] combine socialization studies with genetic analysis to get a better idea about the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of moral judgments."</p>
