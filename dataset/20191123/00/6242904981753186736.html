      </p>
      <p>The Tigers of the East endured a defeat start to the season which saw them in 13th place after the first six matches.</p>
      <p>But they have recovered and are now unbeaten in their last four fixtures- two straight wins and drawing their last two matches.</p>
      <p>Afriyie believes all the pieces are finally coming together now.</p>
      <p>''We’ve had a few ups and downs. Some painful defeats and disappointing stalemates that we could have won, but we’ve always of reacted quite well,'' he said.</p>
      <p>''It was quite difficult from the beginning trying to find our stride because some of us needed a bit of time to adapt.''</p>
      <p>The 28 year-old is confident that the team will build on their recent results and mount a challenge for a spot for a Europe football.</p>
      <p>He said: ''We are still in the running for a Europe spot [Champions League or Europa League]. The season just started, and we've got what it takes to improve our performance last season. And that’s what I’m here for. To help get the team achieve its ambitions.</p>
      <p>Yeni Malatyspor have scored the highest goals (25) in the Turkish top flight, finding the net on nine occasions in the last four games.</p>
      <p>Afriyie enjoyed a man of the match performance in the 4-0 win over Kayserispor when he provided two assists.</p>
      <p>He has made nine appearances with a whoscored rating of 7.06.</p>
