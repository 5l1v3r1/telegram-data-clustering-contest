      <h1>Australia vs Pakistan: David Warner smashes first ton since ball-tampering ban</h1>

      <p><i>Opener cashes in on Naseem no-ball to smash first ton since ball-tampering ban as Aussies take charge</i> <br/><br/>Pakistan were left to rue a basic error from 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah as Australia opener David Warner plundered the visitors’ attack with a brilliant 151 not out on the second day of the first Test at the Gabba. <br/><br/>Australia finished the day on 312 for the loss of just one wicket, 72 runs ahead of Pakistan’s first innings total of 240 and already in the driving seat. <br/><br/>Marnus Labuschagne was alongside Warner on 55, with the only wicket to fall that of Joe Burns, who made 97 before sweeping a Yasir Shah (1/101) delivery onto his stumps. <br/><br/>Warner scored his first Test century since a year-long ban for ball-tampering, but only after a huge let-off when he was caught behind off a Naseem no-ball. <br/><br/>The mercurial opener was on 56 at the time, and he then survived a near run-out on 93 before ending a century drought stretching back nearly two years. The 33-year-old, who managed just 95 runs in 10 innings during this year’s Ashes series against England, reached his 22nd Test ton when he turned Yasir around the corner for a single in the second over after tea. <br/><br/>Before the Ashes, he spent a year in the wilderness over the ball-tampering scandal and there were questions as to whether his days as an automatic choice at the top of the order were over. <br/><br/>However, in home conditions and against an attack that struggled for sideways movement, Warner was in imperious form as he brought up his fourth Test century at the Gabba. <br/><br/>“For me it’s about going out there and backing my ability,” he said, insisting he never felt any pressure about his place in the side. At the end of the day you get selected or you don’t get selected and you’ve just got to accept that.” <br/><br/>In the second last over of the day, Warner had another close shave when he was beaten by an Imran Khan delivery that brushed the off stump without disturbing the bails. “Today I was on the receiving end of a bit of luck, which is what you need in a game — over there (in England) I didn’t get any luck at all,” he said. <br/><br/>Naseem looked impressive on debut and regularly bowled at over 145 kilometres (90 miles) per hour, but he was guilty of overstepping the mark on a number of occasions, despite not being called by the umpire. <br/><br/>Brief scores: Pakistan 240 vs Australia 312/1 (David Warner batting 151, Joe Burns 97, Marnus Labuschagne batting 55)Agencies <br/><br/><br/><b>England take control</b> <br/><br/>England took control of the ongoing first Test against New Zealand after keeping the hosts to 144/4 in their first innings at the Bay Oval on Friday. At Stumps on Day 2, New Zealand were still trailing by 209 runs in reply to England's first innings score of 353. <br/><br/>Brief scores: England 353 all out (Ben Stokes 91, Joe Denly 74; Tim Southee 4/88) vs New Zealand 144/4 (Kane Williamson 51, Henry Nicholls 26*; Sam Curran 2/28)</p>
