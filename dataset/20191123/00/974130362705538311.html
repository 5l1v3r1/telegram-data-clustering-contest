      <h1>Incredible JJ Hanrahan Pass Hands Munster Dramatic Racing Draw</h1>

      <p>Munster have secured a dramatic draw in their Champions Cup game against Racing 92, with an Andrew Conway try and JJ Hanrahan conversion earning the two points.</p>
      <p>Racing played some scintillating rugby in the opening period, with Finn Russell pulling off a <a href="https://www.balls.ie/rugby/watch-munster-racing-try-420677">sublime piece of skill</a> to score their opening try.</p>
      <p>Munster managed to stay within touching distance despite not playing all that well and they entered the final ten minutes only a converted try behind.</p>
      <p>It would take a moment of magic to unlock a stubborn Racing defence, with Hanrahan producing a stunning looping pass to find Andrew Conway on the wing.</p>

      <p>Hanrahan would go on to expertly slot the resulting conversion, getting the home side back on level terms.</p>
      <p>Munster would actually have an opportunity to go on and win the game as they applied the pressure late on. They went through the phases, eventually getting to within five metres of the  opposition line.</p>
      <p>As the Racing defence remained unmoved, Hanrahan had a drop at goal from inside the 22. He didn't catch it well, with the ball ultimately moving well away from the target.</p>
      <p>Consdering where they found themselves in the closing stages, a draw is certainly not a bad result for Munster. It keeps their chances of topping the pool alive, with games against Saracens yet to come.</p>
