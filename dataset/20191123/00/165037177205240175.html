        <b>Goal-scorers Anthony Ujah and Sebastian Andersson say mid-table FC Union are happy forging a reputation as Bundesliga giant-killers after adding Borussia Moenchengladbach to their growing list of big name victims.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Having already stunned Borussia Dortmund and Freiburg</b> at their Alten Foersterei stadium in only their first season in Germany's top flight, <b>Union also shocked Gladbach 2-0 on Saturday in Berlin</b>. It is the second time this season Union have beaten the Bundesliga's leading side after also pulling off a 3-1 win in late August over Dortmund, who then topped the table.</p>
      <p>"I think so now, <b>we have showed the big teams that we can win here</b>," said Andersson Swedish forward. "We're in a good mood, we won't think too much about it, <b>but we want to keep it going</b>."</p>
      <p>Nigeria striker Ujah gave the hosts the lead in the 15th minutes with a well-taken header before Andersson also headed home deep into added time to give Union a fourth straight win. Between them, Andersson and Ujah now have eight league goals this season. <b>Ujah agreed that Union are making a habit of raising their game at home</b>, but warned that beating Gladbach will count for nothing when they travel to fourth-placed Schalke on Friday.</p>

      <p>"<b>We're playing well and we want to make it hard</b> for any opponent to beat us here," said the 29-year-old. "It feels good and we want to keep it going as long as possible, but <b>we are just looking at each game as it comes</b>."</p>
      <p>After their away game in Gelsenkirchen, <b>mid-table Union face two teams in the bottom three</b> when they host Cologne before facing Paderborn away.</p>
      <p>"<b>We are really happy with 16 points after 12 games </b>and we've beaten the leaders, but it doesn't mean it will be any easier to beat Cologne or Paderborn," warned Ujah.</p>
