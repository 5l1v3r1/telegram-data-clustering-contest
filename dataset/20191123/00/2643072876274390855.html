      <p>The Chairman of Air Peace, Allen Onyema, has dismissed reports of his indictment for financial scam, fraud and money laundering by the United States Government.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that Onyema was c<a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/23/us-charge-air-peace-boss-allen-onyema-with-20m-fraud/"><u>harged with bank fraud and money laundering for moving more than $20 million from Nigeria</u></a> through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of aeroplanes.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Friday, the US State Department of Justice said Onyema’s Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has also been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p><i>“Onyema allegedly leveraged his status as a prominent business leader and airline executive while using falsified documents to commit fraud. We will diligently protect the integrity of our banking system from being corrupted by criminals, even when they disguise themselves in a cloak of international business,”</i> U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak, said.</p>
      <p>Robert J. Murphy, the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division, said: <i>“Allen Onyema’s status as a wealthy businessman turned out to be a fraud. He corrupted the U.S. banking system, but his trail of deceit and trickery came to a skidding halt. DEA would like to thank the many law enforcement partners and the subsequent prosecution by the U.S. Attorney’s Office who aided in making this investigation a success.”</i></p>
      <p>Speaking to Daily Trust, Onyema denied ever laundering money in his life.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“I can confirm to you that all allegations are false and are in no way in line with my character as a person and as a businessman whose only aim has been to build Nigeria and improve wellbeing.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“As the press statement clearly stated, these are indictments that only contains charges. I am innocent of all charges and the US government will find NO dirt on me because I have never conducted business with any illegalities.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Rest assured that I also have my lawyers on this and these mere allegations will be refuted.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I never laundered money in my life, neither have I committed bank fraud anywhere in the world. Every Kobo I transferred to the US for aircraft purchase went through the Central Bank of Nigeria LC regime and all were used for the same purpose. The American companies that received the funds are still in business. I never took a penny from any US bank or Nigerian bank. I am willing to defend my innocence in the US courts.”</i>
