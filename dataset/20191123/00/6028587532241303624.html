      <h1>Investors Should Support Extinction Rebellion And Here’s How They Can Do So</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Bob Eccles</a></address>
      <p>The U.K.-originating climate activist group <a href="https://rebellion.earth/">Extinction Rebellion</a> (XR) has caused a substantial amount of disruption. Its tactics include blocking traffic, grounding flights, and gluing themselves to public buildings and to each other. This has created inconvenience for law-abiding British citizens and annoyance to the British government. As a result, almost 3,000 XR activists have been arrested in London in the mass actions of April and October this year, with hundreds more arrests around the world as XR groups spring up in 70 countries from Australia to the U.S. One of its founders, Roger Hallam, recently spent over a month in jail and has spoken about this in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da2kkILHOVk">video</a>. A number of prominent members of XR have had their phones and laptops confiscated by police.</p>

      <p>Yes, XR is causing disruption. It is their job. This movement is seeking to create a still-insufficient sense of urgency amongst all of us about the threat of climate change to human society. In order to do so, I believe that XR needs investors. Investors also need XR if they are going to be able to earn the returns they need for their beneficiaries—assuming they’re still around.</p>
      <p>The goal of The Paris Agreement is to keep the Earth’s average temperature from rising 1.5-2.0° C above pre-industrial levels. Current models predict that the temperature will rise by 3.0-4.0°C by 2100. Should this happen, this will be a nightmare world, perhaps supporting, at best, one billion people, compared to the 7.6 billion we have today, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/18/climate-crisis-heat-is-on-global-heating-four-degrees-2100-change-way-we-live">Johan Rockstrom</a>, a noted climate scientist. 2100 is 81 years away; about the life expectancy of a child born in <a href="https://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/life_tables/situation_trends_text/en/">Europe</a> or <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/274513/life-expectancy-in-north-america/">North America</a> today.</p>
      <p>Lending credence to these concerns, in October the U.S. Army issued a <a href="https://climateandsecurity.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/implications-of-climate-change-for-us-army_army-war-college_2019.pdf">repor</a>t saying that dealing with climate change could actually lead to its own collapse. And this month more than <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biz088/5610806">11,000 scientist signatories</a> from around the world stated, “clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency.”</p>

      <p>Yes, there is debate and uncertainty about this. But citing a variety of scientific sources, the NGO <a href="https://planb.earth/climate-science-in-a-page/">Plan B</a> briefly summarizes both the horrors and probability of a 4°C warming scenario, including the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>’s (IPCC) own <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf">2014</a> conclusions that it’s more likely than not “without additional mitigation efforts.” Let’s remember global emissions rose in 2017 and 2018! “To put in perspective, how many of us would choose to buckle our grandchildren to an airplane seat if we knew there was as much as a 1 in 20 chance of the plane crashing?" said Professor Veerabhadran Ramanathan in a <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-window-is-closing-to-avoid-dangerous-global-warming/">statement</a>. "With climate change that can pose existential threats, we have already put them in that plane."</p>
      <p>The issue that XR is addressing is that 2100 is both distant yet very near. Investors can play a critical role in bringing the future into the present by raising the level of awareness in the corporate community. How can they do this?</p>
      <p>Good guidance comes from XR’s three demands of the U.K. government:</p>
      <p>·     <b>01-Tell the Truth: </b>“Government must tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency, working with other institutions to communicate the urgency for change.”</p>
      <p>·     <b>02-Act Now: </b>“Government must act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025.”</p>
      <p>·     <b>03-Beyond Politics: </b>“Government must create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens’ Assembly on climate and ecological justice.”</p>

      <p>Investors are not governments so the specifics must be adapted and this will vary on one’s role in the investment community. Most critical are the portfolio managers (PMs) in asset owners and asset managers. They must first do their homework and decide if they believe the climate emergency is real. It would be shameful to not take a position on this and many have not. But if a PM believes that there is a very real threat to life on earth as we know it, he or she should:</p>
      <p>·     <b>Tell the Truth </b>by raising this issue with their portfolio companies, asking them for their stance on the climate emergency and XR. A fundamental aspect of being a PM is risk analysis. There is no greater long-term risk than climate change and fiduciary duty should require that it be incorporated into investment decisions.</p>
      <p>·     <b>Act now </b>by engaging with portfolio companies to work with them to do as much as they can to help halt biodiversity loss and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  by around 50 percent by 2030 to net zero by 2050. (These targets come from the 2018 <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/download/#chapter">report</a> of the IPCC for what is needed to keep temperatures rising by more than 1.5°C.)  In many cases, short-term earnings will have to be sacrificed for long-term corporate sustainability and investor returns.</p>
      <p>·     <b>Beyond politics </b>means having the discussion with executives in portfolio companies based on science, not on anyone’s political views. This is not about politics, it is about humanity’s survival.</p>

      <p>XR is a movement that needs <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world">3.5 percent</a> of the population to be actively engaged in it, along with significant support from the broader population, if it is to succeed. PMs are in a key role to expand participation. Imagine if every PM were having this conversation with their portfolio companies. Doing so will be as constructively disruptive as actions in the streets, which will remain necessary. While it won’t get the same degree of media attention, it will be a powerful way of taking XR inside the business community. Without it, XR cannot succeed. Without XR, the business community as we know it is finished—along with most of the rest of us.</p>
      <p>Of course, most people aren’t PMs but many of us are individual investors. We can follow these same guidelines in our own investment decisions, raising them with those who advise us on these decisions, and making our views known to those who are ultimately managing OUR money, such as pension funds.</p>
      <p>Finally, we are all also citizens and need to decide whether we support XR or not. Don’t decide this by default. Study the issue and study them and decide. I’ve done both and I’ve <a href="https://rebellion.earth/act-now/join-us/">joined</a>.</p>
