      <p>The right back has been promoted by head coach  Frank Vercauteren after being overlooked for a very long time.</p>
      <p>Adjei recently recovered from injured and featured for the Purple and Whites in a friendly during the international break.</p>
      <p>He was given 30 minutes of game time and he gave a good account of himself.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old last played for the first team in September 2017 during when he was named in the starting line-up in the 2-1 win at Waasland-Beveren.</p>
      <p>Last season, he did not come close to the First Team.</p>
