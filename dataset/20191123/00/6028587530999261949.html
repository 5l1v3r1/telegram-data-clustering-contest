      <h1>CDC Report Suggests Antibacterial Resistance Could Undo Almost A Century Of Progress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Nicole Fisher</a></address>
      <p>In 1928 a Scottish researcher returned to his lab after a two-week vacation to discover a mold had developed on an accidentally contaminated culture plate. Upon examining and testing the mold, <a href="https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/alexander-fleming">Sir Alexander Fleming</a> went on to receive credit for the discovery of penicillin – the first naturally occurring antibiotic drug. His bacteria killing discovery is now the most widely used antibiotic in the world, responsible for adding 20 years to human life expectancy, saving millions of lives, and changing the course of medicine.But since penicillin saved the first life in 1942 the development and use of antibiotics has changed radically. And the germs that modern-day antibiotics have been designed to fight, are becoming ever more resistant to the antibiotics. In fact, almost 3 million antibiotic resistant infections occur each year in the U.S. alone, resulting in more than 35,000 deaths. </p>
      <p>Globally, <a href="https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/IACG_final_report_EN.pdf?ua=1">according to the United Nations</a>, drug-resistant infections – or superbugs - result in about 700,000 deaths per year. And these numbers are expected to continue to rise as new strains emerge and old solutions go woefully neglected by national leadership. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019">World Health Organization</a>, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one the globe’s top 10 public health threats. Noting that the ability to prevent infections via AMR is threatening to “send us back in time.” </p>
      <p>Thus, for the first time in six years (and the second time in history), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf">released a report</a> on antibiotic resistance threats in America. As expected, the statistics are quite shocking – proving that this global health crisis is in no way someone else’s problem, but instead, a domestic problem on the verge of threatening almost a century worth of progress. </p>

        <b>The Threat On Many Fronts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Antimicrobial resistance can be difficult to understand given that it includes agents that are antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal, and antiprotozoal. However, the vast majority target bacterial infections. These collective drugs fight diseases in not only human beings, but also animals and plants. Meaning, that as humans we are exposed to antimicrobials in many different ways, including animals, plants, food, water, and the environment. Each encounter adding to the likelihood resistance can build in existing germs. </p>
      <p>Given that we encounter them in our everyday lives, it’s important to understand just how great the threat of developing resistance is to our health, and why there are so few solutions.</p>
      <p>- Everyone is at risk. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/threats-report/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf">new CDC report</a> antibiotic resistance spreads easily thanks to globalization, and the constant movement of goods, animals and people. The report stresses that a resistance threat anywhere is a threat at home.</p>
      <p>- <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00270-4/fulltext">The Lancet Infectious Diseases</a> contends that 40-50% of post-surgery bugs are already drug-resistant. </p>
      <p>- The economics are upside-down. The less drugs people take, the better the drug works. Further, it takes on average, <a href="https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/SECURING%20NEW%20DRUGS%20FOR%20FUTURE%20GENERATIONS%20FINAL%20WEB_0.pdf">23 years after the preclinical research stage</a> for an antimicrobial to turn a profit. Thus, antimicrobial R&amp;D is not cost-effective. </p>
      <p>- According to <a href="https://workingtofightamr.org/">Working To Fight AMR</a>, scientists have developed only “one truly novel antibiotic since 1984, and just 1% of medicines in development globally address bacterial infections.”</p>
      <p>- <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/05/ascientificroadmapforantibioticdiscovery.pdf">Pew Charitable Trusts</a> asserts that antibiotic discovery peaked in the 1950s, and that nearly all antibiotics created over the last 30 years are simply variations on already existing drugs.  </p>
      <p>- Back in 2010, almost five times as many Americans died from multi-drug resistant superbugs than in car accidents (approximately <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/reestimating-annual-deaths-due-to-multidrugresistant-organism-infections/C9B09A787FCCA1EA992AF45066F3FF7C">160,000</a> and <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/811630">33,000</a> respectively).</p>
      <p>- Due to a growing number of AMR germs, it is estimated that by 2050, drug resistance could be responsible for as many as 10 million deaths worldwide each year – a number higher than estimates of cancer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Challenges And Opportunities</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/despite-looming-resistance-crisis-novartis-ducks-out-antibiotics-research">closing of antimicrobial pipelines</a> and <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/big-pharma-backs-off-superbug-why-5-drugmakers-bailed-on-antibiotic-research.html">reduction in antibiotic research</a> poses a global dilemma for public health experts. At present, payment structures illustrate just how low antibiotics are on the health care priority list. And yet, without antibiotics everyday procedures like C-sections and hip replacements would see drastic increases in infection and death rates. But hope is not lost – either domestically or globally. </p>
      <p>For example, in the last several months the bipartisan <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s1712/text/is">DISARM Act</a> (Developing an Innovative Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms Act of 2019) was introduced in the Senate as a means of increasing payments for use of effective antibiotics. Additionally, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/fiscal-year-fy-2020-medicare-hospital-inpatient-prospective-payment-system-ipps-and-long-term-acute-0">CMS issued a final rule</a> to increase Medicare payments to hospitals for using advanced antibiotics (thought to be a great weapon against AMR). In tandem, it is hoped that in the U.S. hospitals will become better stewards of antibiotic use with better financial incentivization – and further, that biotech companies will subsequently be prompted to resume R&amp;D in the space.</p>
      <p>In September at the United Nations General Assembly, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2019-speeches/remarks-one-year-anniversary-antimicrobial-resistance-challenge.html">HHS Secretary Alex Azar remarked</a> that on behalf of the United States government, the U.S. was thankful that at the one-year mark of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/intl-activities/amr-challenge.html">CDC’s AMR Challenge</a> (which includes a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/index.html">One Health</a> approach) almost 35 countries have joined the collective fight to establish responsible antibiotic use, improve infection control, and partner to improve sanitation. Out of the more then 350 commitments to the movement, multinational organizations such as McDonalds and Yum! Brands are working to decrease the use of antibiotics in their meet and food production.</p>
      <p>Another portfolio of public-private partnerships has also gotten a big boost in recent years as the <a href="https://www.phe.gov/about/barda/Pages/default.aspx">Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority</a> (BARDA) within HHS has provided technical, scientific, and financial support of over $1 billion to fight AMR. The partnerships include a series of new antibiotics that are in clinical development around the world – including countries like the U.S., U.K., and Germany.</p>
      <p>Despite the commitments of governments, particularly the United States, to improve the current state of antibiotic R&amp;D and proper usage, mismatched incentives, significant lags in research, and continual misuse of current antibiotics means that we are in an uphill battle. We are literally in a fight to ensure that a century worth of progress isn’t lost. And that is going to take a lot more than is currently given, <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/drug-resistant-infections">including speeding up development and delivery</a> of new or improved antibiotic treatments and diagnostics, accelerating clinical assessments, facilitating more public-private partnerships around the globe, and literally putting the money were the problem is – before it’s too late.</p>
