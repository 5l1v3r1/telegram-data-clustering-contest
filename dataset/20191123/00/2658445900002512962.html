      <p>Calabar, Nigerian number one leisure destination, is gradually getting in the mood for the season. The yuletide  is around the corner.  In Calabar, everybody is preparing for the season.  The city has made it a duty to put up a show for everybody. This it has been doing in the last 15 years. It has become a culture to host  people from all parts of the country, and inbound tourists at the end of every year.</p>
      <p>Although residents of Lagos would say ‘ain’t no party like the Lagos party,’  everybody has accepted that ‘Calabar rocks’ thanks to Carnival Calabar. The carnival is a street show which everybody loves and looks forward to. Those who cannot watch it live, follow the fiesta through the television. The viewership through cable television and via the social media runs into millions.</p>
      <p>To put up this carnival, like the organisers say, takes a year’s planning.</p>

      <p>The final stage of this planning is the carnival dry run, a kind of rehearsal used to test every aspect of the show to make it prime for the D-day, December 27.</p>
      <p>There are three dry runs that ushers in the main event. Two are held in the month of November and the final dry run is in the month of December, about two weeks before the main show.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, the second dry run was held. Almost all the participating groups in Carnival Calabar were part of it excluding international groups.</p>
      <p>On hand to flag off the second dry run was the deputy governor of the state, Professor Evarah Esu, who represented Governor Ben Ayade. Former first lady of the state, Pastor Onari Duke, the speaker of the state house of assembly Mr. Eteng Jonah-William were part of the dry run.</p>
      <p>Just like the revelers would do, at the main carnival, the dry run involved dancing on the 12 kilometer stretch.</p>
      <p>Professor Esu who did led the carnival train enthusiastically showed off some trending dance moves that would leave some youths envious.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The theme for this year’s carnival is ‘Humanity.’ Speaking on the theme in an earlier message, Professor Esu said: “”This year’s theme is humanity; I hope that the band leaders are doing their best to give full interpretation to the theme.</p>
      <p>“For us, the theme is about humanity and kindness to people. We should be tolerant of one other and also treat every human being as a human being irrespective of any affiliation.</p>
      <p>“If you decide to treat people badly, you too will be treated badly; so, what we are emphasising on is the need for everyone to be treated equally.</p>
      <p>“As we come out for every celebration of the Carnival, we will continue to play our path in ensuring that the Carnival continues to grow bigger, better and bolder.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mr Gabe Onah, Chairman of Calabar Carnival Commission, said that the theme was also designed to reach out and touch the people towards kindness and unity.</p>
      <p>Onah said that the Bikers’ Carnival was also flagged off earlier with a view to excite tourists along the 12 kilometres Carnival route.</p>
      <p>Onah said that Carnival Calabar has become a platform to taste how cultural events are planned in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Calabar Carnival has become the best platform for cultural diplomacy. The first dry run witnessed the attendance of Bangladesh and Belize diplomats, offering partnership in power production and distribution and support for our cocoa processing.</p>
      <p>“For the next dry run, we are expecting Vietnam to come and partner with the state rice seedlings to see how they can bring farmers to promote the next level for our farming.</p>
      <p>“The dancing and display we see in the streets is a means to an end. The job behind Calabar Carnival is huge and that is why we are saying that we must begin to change as we move,” he said.</p>
      <p>Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Mr Eteng Jonah-Williams, said that the assembly will make adequate budgetary provision for the Carnival Commission to enable them organised a colourful event.</p>
      <p>Jonah-Williams said that the assembly was suggesting on having “The Cross River House of Assembly Band” to add colour to the event.</p>
      <p>The participants were colourfully dressed in their various bands costumes, while security was mounted along the routes to ensure a hitch free event.</p>
