      <p>A pair of New England Patriots currently lead their positions in <a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/Baltimore-Ravens-Quarterback-Lamar-Jackson-Leads-Pro-Bowl-Voting-By-Fans.aspx">AFC Pro Bowl</a> fan voting.Matthew Slater, who has seven selections on his résumé, is one. The rookie whose punts have been tracked down by New England’s longtime captain of all things special teams is the other.</p>
      <p>Jake Bailey.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday afternoon, Bailey stood with a conference-leading 15,895 votes at punter. And as of Wednesday morning, the Stanford product also stood with his second <a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/AFC-and-NFC-Players-of-the-Week---Week-11-----------------------.aspx">AFC Special Teams Player of the Week</a> honor.</p>
      <p>Fitting timing.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles, having acquired No. 167 and No. 246 overall in April for the rights to No. 163 overall, faced New England’s eventual draft pick last Sunday.</p>
      <p>At Lincoln Financial Field, Bailey punted eight times. Those punts traveled a total of 381 yards. They traveled an average of 47.6 yards per in high winds for a player whose four-year rookie pact is worth $2.81 million with a $290,000 signing bonus.</p>
      <p>A player who succeeded Ryan Allen, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/08/20/rookie-punter-jake-bailey-brings-ryan-allens-patriots-tenure-to-an-end/#406ae3d65e06">longest-tenured Patriots punter</a> since Bill Belichick became head coach.</p>
      <p>“He’s done a good job of, I would say, adapting to the conditions,” Belichick said of Bailey in his <a href="https://www.patriots.com/video/bill-belichick-11-17-it-was-a-really-good-team-victory">postgame press conference</a>. “He’s still got a long way to go. I’m sure he’ll learn a lot more as the season goes along. But between the holding, the kickoffs and the punting in various conditions and certainly situational football which came up today – the end-of-the-game punts and backed-up punts and plus 50-punts and the kickoffs and so forth – there were a lot of situations. But he’s a great kid. He works hard. He’s really played well for us this entire season, and he’s been so valuable to this team and he proved it out there today.”</p>
      <p>Six punts fell inside the Philadelphia 20-yard line on Sunday. Five exceeded 50 yards.</p>
      <p>Bailey’s final one went for 54. It sent the Eagles’ offense, down by seven points with under a minute remaining, back onto the field with only a dozen yards in the rearview mirror.</p>
      <p>“Jake is a rookie, and the way he’s been punting the ball all year is awesome,” Patriots safety Devin McCourty <a href="https://www.patriots.com/news/new-england-patriots-postgame-quotes-11-17">told reporters</a> afterward.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, he’s done such a great job all year,” quarterback Tom Brady said Monday on <a href="https://weei.radio.com/media/audio-channel/ghs-tom-brady-his-frustration-patriots-offense-11-18-19">WEEI’s Greg Hill Show</a>. “Came in and battled through training camp, and just has been really an exceptional player for our team. Kicking the ball so well.”</p>

      <p>Bailey has punted 56 times thus far into his rookie campaign with New England. Opposing returners have combined to amass just 98 return yards. Those marks rank third-most and 23rd-most, respectively.</p>
      <p>It’s been a symbiotic relationship between the right leg and the coverage. Only the Tennessee Titans’ Brett Kern has seen more punts fall inside the 20 this fall. And only Kern as seen more punts work their way out of bounds.</p>
      <p>“I think field position is huge, and I believe I’m on a team that really values field position greatly,” Bailey told Steve Burton during his recent appearance on <a href="https://www.patriots.com/video/one-on-one-with-jake-bailey">Patriots All-Access</a>. “And that’s a reason why we keep around a lot of the special-teamers that we do, and they’ve been helping me out so much. So it shows that they value it tremendously.”</p>
      <p>The Patriots have closed in for 15 fair catches while downing an additional eight punts.</p>
      <p>Bailey has also served as New England’s holder since the start of the season, and as the kickoff specialist since all-time franchise scoring leader Stephen Gostkowski went to injured reserve in early October.</p>
      <p>Coverage has been outkicked in one sense. In another, it’s been right there in lockstep.</p>
