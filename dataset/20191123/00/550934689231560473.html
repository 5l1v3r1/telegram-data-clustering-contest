      <h4>National Democratic Party supporters have come together in Hanover to protest against journalists, but they were vastly outnumbered by counterdemonstrators. There were no serious clashes between the groups, police said.</h4>
      <p>More than 7,000 people took to the streets of Hanover on Saturday as part of a demonstration to protect press freedom and against threats to journalists.</p>
      <p>The march came in response to a rally organized by the extreme-right <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-police-investigate-extreme-right-npd-video-showing-protection-patrol-on-trains/a-44717751">National Democratic Party</a> (NPD) against journalists. Only around 120 people attended the NPD rally, according to the police.</p>
      <p>The counterdemonstration in the northern German state of Lower Saxony was welcomed by German Foreign Minister <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/heiko-maas-against-unilateral-removal-of-nuclear-weapons-from-germany/a-51362754">Heiko Maas</a>. He tweeted: "One can see what applies throughout Germany: The neo-Nazis and fear makers, who hound journalists, are in the minority. Thank you to everyone who is protesting peacefully today against this unworthy parade."</p>

      <p>"Say it loud and clear: far-right agitation against journalists ... and press freedom are an attack on our democracy," Weil said.</p>

        <b>Four arrests but few incidents</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police concerns over possible outbreaks of violence between the two groups were thus far allayed, though four arrests were made.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Hanover police banned the right-wing extremist group from demonstrating, but late Friday the Higher Administrative Court overturned the initial decision, deciding the NPD had the right to protest.</p>
      <p>The NPD had promoted their march by posting a picture online of a broadcast journalist who has done in-depth reporting about far-right movements in Germany.</p>

            <figcaption><b>Stephan Weil, premier of Lower Saxony <br/></b>The 60-year-old leads a coalition of the SPD and the Christian Democrats in his northern state. In the Bundesrat — the council of Germany's 16 states and upper house of parliament — he serves on the Committee on Foreign Affairs and is deputy chairman of the Committee on European Affairs. Many in the SPD have long seen him as a possible new hope to lead the party forward.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Manuela Schwesig, premier of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania<br/></b>Schwesig, born and raised in the former East Germany, is the first woman to lead the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The 45-year-old previously served as minister of family affairs under Chancellor Angela Merkel, a role she used to push for equal opportunities for women and better state childcare facilities. She serves on the Bundesrat's Committee on Foreign Affairs.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Olaf Scholz, finance minister and vice chancellor<br/></b>Scholz, 60, is seen by some of his fellow party members as a technocrat and is considered to belong to the SPD's conservative wing. As finance minister under Merkel, he has been committed to curbing public spending and keeping a lid on new debt. He also served as federal minister of labor and social affairs in Merkel's Cabinet from 2007 to 2009.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Malu Dreyer, premier of Rhineland-Palatinate<br/></b>A reasonably popular figure in the SPD, Dreyer was voted in as deputy party chairwoman in 2017 with 97.5% backing. Despite repeatedly stating she would not want to leave her western state for Berlin, she is still seen as a possible replacement for Nahles. The 58-year-old has served as premier of Rhineland-Palatinate since 2013 and is the first woman to hold the office.</figcaption>

In that role, he is responsible for foreign affairs, defense and human rights policy. He is well respected within the party and could be tapped as interim SPD leader in the Bundestag.</figcaption>

He is a deputy chair of the SPD's parliamentary group, overseeing budgetary affairs, finance and Europe. As secretary-general of the Party of European Socialists, he is also considered well connected at the European level.</figcaption>

            <figcaption><b>Martin Schulz, ex-SPD leader<br/></b>The former president of the European Parliament has been suggested as another possible challenger. The 63-year-old ran as the SPD's candidate for chancellor in 2017 but lost to Merkel. He subsequently stepped down as SPD leader. He has already said he doesn't want the job back, but Germany's Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported last week that he was keen to lead the SPD parliamentary group.</figcaption>
