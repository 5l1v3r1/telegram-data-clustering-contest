      <p>LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) - A man who threatened to bomb a northwestern Indiana courthouse, prompting the building’s evacuation, has been sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
      <p>A special judge sentenced 48-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-battering/">Michael Battering</a> on Friday after detailing the lengthy criminal history he had amassed before he threatened to bomb the Tippecanoe County Courthouse in Lafayette.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-battering/">Battering</a> pleaded guilty last month to intimidation and false informing. The Journal &amp; Courier reports he also pleaded guilty to fraud for using a stolen credit card to buy the cellphone he used to make the threat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-battering/">Battering</a> claimed he was high on meth and heroin when he called in the April 11 bomb threat, spurring the courthouse’s evacuation. Police found no bombs in the building.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/michael-battering/">Battering</a> told the court he’s “seriously sorry for upsetting everybody’s lives that day.”</p>
