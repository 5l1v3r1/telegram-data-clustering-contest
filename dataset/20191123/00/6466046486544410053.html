      <p>Hamburg - The <b>Elbe deepening project </b>that will dig the way for fully-loaded mega-ships to access the Port of Hamburg goes one step further with the building of two new underwater storage areas.</p>
      <p>A total of around <b>1,200,000 tons of underwater construction </b>stones were built into the “Medemrinne” and “Neufelder Sand” underwater deposit areas between March and October. “The biggest challenge of the project was to handle the multiple parallel handling of all ships involved in the project as well as the related pre-carriages and on-carriages,” explains the project team in a press release.</p>
      <p>The <b>stone mixtures </b>were required for the completion of respective central dams within the UDAs in the Elbe estuary funnel, so that the sediment quantities excavated later could be stored there and not washed back into the Elbe or the North Sea.</p>
      <p>From March to September 2019, the <b>more than 1 million tons of underwater construction stones</b> arrived in more than 40 ship arrivals from Norway and were delivered to the two underwater construction sites in two independent logistics cycles, each with three construction site ships</p>
