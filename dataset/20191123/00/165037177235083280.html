        <b>Late goals from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna ensured Jose Mourinho endured a nervy finale on his first game in charge of Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jose Mourinho</b> felt fatigue and emotions in his <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> team were reasons for <b>West Ham's late fightback </b>as he enjoyed a <b>3-2 Premier League win </b>at London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Goals from <b>Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane </b>had Spurs cruising in former Manchester United and Chelsea boss <b>Mourinho's first game in charge</b> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But substitute<b> Michail Antonio </b>gave the Hammers hope before<b> Declan Rice had a second goal ruled out for offside, Angelo Ogbonna </b>then scoring from a corner in the sixth minute of added time.</p>
      <p>Spurs <b>moved up to sixth in the table</b> by virtue of their first away win in the league in 13 attempts with Mourinho satisfied by what he saw from his new side after <b>replacing Mauricio Pochettino.</b></p>
      <p><b>"I was really happy for one," </b>Mourinho said to BT Sport. "Obviously I was very, very happy. We were playing well, bringing to the game things we had tried in training".</p>
      <p>"We spoke a lot about it. I was really happy. And we had [the chance to make it] 4-0 and kill the game".</p>
      <p>"We are lucky I have so many years in the Premier League that I told the players at half-time, 'Even if we are 3-0 in the 85th minute<b> the game will still be open'. </b>I think they understood that".</p>
      <p>"But for the last 20 minutes, of course,<b> fatigue, people coming from national teams, </b>all the emotions of losing the manager, another one comes, start working with me".</p>
      <p>"Clearly fatigue in the last 20 minutes and also <b>a reaction from a very good team</b> and very good players. The coach tried different things, they were being more direct, putting the ball in our box and <b>creating pressure".</b></p>

      <p>"It was not easy, but<b> I liked very, very much our first 60 minutes. </b>Not just happy with the work, but also enjoying".</p>
      <p>"The most important thing in the end was not to win 3-0 or 4-0 or play wonderfully, no matter how, the three points were most important for us. Maybe also <b>the mental barrier of so many months without an away win </b>was important".</p>
      <p>"The boys are happy and that's what I really wanted. <b>I wanted them to be back to happiness </b>and there's nothing better than winning a football match, let me tell you."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/b-ali-203578">Dele Alli </a>lost form in the latter period of Pochettino's era but the England midfielder, who has<b> slipped out of favour for the Three Lions</b>,Â helped to create the second Spurs goal with a fine piece of improvised individual skill.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy with everyone but if you ask me if <b>I'm happy with Dele</b>, then yes," Mourinho said. "I spent a few minutes with him in training and in social life, outside the pitch".</p>
      <p><b>"The best Dele has to be back.</b> He's too good not to be in the national team<b>, he's too good not to be an important player for Spurs,</b> he's too good not to be one of the best players in the world".</p>
      <p>"He has to start from now, hopefully, without injuries, hopefully with some stability, also from a tactical point of view.<b> He's a fantastic player. I'm happy he's here."</b></p>
