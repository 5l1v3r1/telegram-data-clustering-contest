      <p>Deontay Wilder is ultra-confident he’s going to knock out Luis Ortiz again to regain his heavyweight title on Saturday night on Fox PPV. Ortiz feels sure he’s going to get his revenge from their first fight 20 months ago and score his own stoppage victory.

He’s definitely a bad old man, that’s for sure.”</p>
      <p>Ortiz would rather <i>put</i> Wilder to sleep, for sure. But Ortiz is also 40 years old, and oftentimes, when a boxer gets knocked out by an opponent, they get knocked out even quicker in the rematch.</p>

      <p>As you wait for the bouts to begin at 9 p.m. ET, here’s my recent Forbes boxing coverage.</p>
