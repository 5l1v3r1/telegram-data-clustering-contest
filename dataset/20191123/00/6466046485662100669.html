      <p>Washington - Samsung heavy industries has <b>agreed to pay more than $75 million in criminal penalties</b> to resolve a U.S. investigation of a scheme to pay millions of dollars in bribes to officials in Brazil, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday.</p>
      <p>Samsung Heavy has <b>admitted to paying about $20 million to a Brazilian intermediary </b>between 2007 and 2013 knowing that parts of it would be paid as bribes to officials in Brazilâ€™s state-run oil company Petrobras for a contract which facilitated the sale of a drill ship by Samsung Heavy, the Justice Department said in a statement. Samsung Heavy will pay at least half of the total fine to the U.S. government under a deferred prosecution agreement filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, it said.</p>
