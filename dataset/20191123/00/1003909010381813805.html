      <p>The Grey Cup is a time for fans from coast to coast to meet fellow CFLers and on Friday morning die-hards of three-down football had a chance to ask the CFL commissioner questions about the league they love.</p>
      <p>Several hundred people lined the hallways of the Boyce Theatre in Calgary for a chance to ask Randy Ambrosie some burning questions about the state of the league.</p>
      <p>The commish started off the forum by applauding Calgary’s hospitality as this year’s host city, highlighting some memorable moments from the past season including the rise of new quarterbacks who took the league by storm and the potential of finally having the Montreal Alouettes ownership situation resolved.</p>
      <p>“We hope to have some really good news for fans in a few weeks regarding the Alouettes ownership,” said Ambrosie.</p>
      <p>One topic for fans at the forum was how to get younger fans interested in CFL football.</p>
      <p>“CFL is a great product but we need younger fans, by marketing it better to high school kids and kids in general and make it a bit more fun,” said Eskimos fan Danny Povaschuk.</p>
      <p>A few Calgary fans said that the Stampeders have done a good job of bringing in some touch football leagues into the city to help but suggested the league could do more.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think every kid is an athlete and I think a video game would open the league up to more of a fan base and it’s a way to get it out to more fans from around the world,” mentioned Calgary native Joe Prado. </p>
      <p>Another thing top fans questioned heading into Sunday’s big game was the quality of McMahon Stadium compared to other stadiums around the league. McMahon is one of the oldest stadiums and some wonder if it’s really suitable to host such a prestigious event like the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>“We have been to recent Grey Cups and the experience at all those stadiums is more modern facilities and it’s a lot easier to get around the concourse so it’s just a much better experience overall,” Prado added </p>
      <p>“Every city has to go through a stage where their stadiums are shiny and new and then they are not and I know council here is working on it but it is not easy to get funding for a new multimillion-dollar stadium,” said Winnipegger Ken Howell.</p>
      <p>Something most fans shared with the commissioner was how they despised the league’s triple-header games on Saturday, noting nine straight hours of football just isn’t realistic for the average football fan.</p>
      <p>Ambrosie ended the open forum by hinting to the fact the league was collaborating with USports in an effort to have Vanier Cup played in the same city as the Grey Cup by as early as 2020, something quickly met by applause to a room full of football fans.</p>
