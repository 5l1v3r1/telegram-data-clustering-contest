      <h2>Leah Watts, 28, is allergic to gluten, dairy, e-numbers and nine types of medication but suffered two serious allergic reactions while staying in Queen's Hospital in Romford</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:50:40+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:50</time> by <a rel="author">Tiffany Lo, Louise Lazell</a></address>
      <p>A woman in hospital after an allergic reaction was forced to endure two more attacks - because staff kept giving her the wrong food.</p>
      <p>Leah Watts, 28, of Doddinghurst in Brentwood, Essex, was rushed to Queen's Hospital in Romford on Tuesday when she suffered an reaction from her lunch during work.</p>
      <p>Her lips started to swell and a purple rash came up from her chest onto her face shortly after having the meal.</p>
      <p>Leah said she always carries a list of her allergies including gluten, dairy, e-numbers and nine types of medication.</p>
      <p>After having a secondary reaction to the allergy she was transferred to a hospital ward.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.essexlive.news/news/essex-news/woman-thought-die-nurses-food-3559992">Essex Live</a> : "I started getting hives again all over my chest and face and my lips started to swell and I was struggling to breathe.</p>

        <figcaption>She claimed the nurse 'turned the buzzer off' when she desperately called for a doctor</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"My mum ran and got some help and they take you through to a cubical in the Majors Light unit where a doctor came and injected me."</p>
      <p>After her medication, Leah's reaction started to calm back down and she gave the doctor a copy of her allergies for her files.</p>
      <p>That evening, the dinner lady came around - but Leah went hungry after being told they 'don't cater for allergies'.</p>
      <p>But just a few hours later, Leah began reacting again and had to have more medication.</p>
      <p>During the course of the next few days Leah claims she was forced to give hospital staff a list of her allergies twice more after it 'disappeared'.</p>

        <figcaption>Her lips swelled and a purple rash came up from her chest to her face</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And the pharmacist looked in her file on Thursday for the list of allergens, they were again not there.</p>
      <p>Leah was told she would be able to go home after lunch.</p>
      <p>"I had a ham salad and fruit pot. I ate one slice of ham and two mouth fulls of the fruit pot and then my face swelled up and my rash came up and I couldn't breathe," she said.</p>
      <p>She pressed the nurse alarm and urged to call the doctor, explaining that she was struggling to breathe.</p>
      <p>While waiting for the doctor, Leah buzzed another four times and each time she claimed the nurse 'just turned her buzzer off'.</p>
      <p>"I thought I was going to die," Leah said. "They were just leaving me and leaving me.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I am well enough to do my own but I couldn't do it, I couldn't even get out of bed.</p>
      <p>"When they arrived, she was absolutely horrified by the state I was in, my mum burst into tears.</p>
      <p>"My oxygen levels had gone from 100% to 72%."</p>
      <p>When they investigated what had happened, they found out that Leah had reacted to the syrup in the fruit pot which contained e-numbers.</p>
      <p>Leah's mum then requested to have a meeting with the ward manager, pharmacist and a nurse.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old explained they were told in the meeting that the nurse who had ignored her was an agency nurse and wouldn't be used again.</p>

      <p>She added that the manager commented on the nurses who didn't use the epipens, saying it was a "training issue".</p>
      <p>Leah then had to be readmitted for further monitoring.</p>
      <p>"I didn't want to be there because everything was just going from bad to worse," Leah said.</p>
      <p>For the rest of Thursday and Friday, Leah stayed in a ward where she was put on a saline drip.</p>
      <p>But just two days after the food-mishap, which caused Leah's reaction, it happened again.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 16, at 10am, a nurse came around to administer Leah's morning medication, some piriton, steroids and lactalose.</p>
      <p>Leah said: "Before I took it, I said 'can you check the ingredients please, I have an allergy to e-numbers' and she looked at the bottle and said 'yes its fine, it just contains sugar.'"</p>
      <p>Just 15 minutes after taking the lactalose, Leah said she came up in a rash and her face and lips began swelling.</p>
      <p>The lactalose contained e-numbers.</p>
      <p>"One nurse said he would get sacked if he administered the epipen as it was not prescribed and he couldn't find my drug chart to check," she said.</p>
      <p>"He just walked away.</p>
      <p>"One lady saw me because I was gasping for air and vomiting and said he was getting help. She went and got the ward matron who asked to see my tongue.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't even stick my tongue out."</p>
      <p>Leah said the matron took the cap off the epipen and put it in Leah's hand to inject herself, because she said she couldn't.</p>
      <p>"I was so scared they were give me something else I was frightened at that point," she continued.</p>
      <p>"A hospital is supposed to be somewhere safe and I had been in there two days and had two serious reactions."</p>
      <p>Kathryn Halford, Chief Nurse and deputy Chief Executive, said: “We’re extremely sorry and disappointed to hear about Leah’s experience.</p>
      <p>“Our Patient Advice and Liaison Service is there to support our patients and resolve any issues, so we would encourage Leah to get in touch as soon as possible so we can look into this further for her.</p>
      <p>"It’s really important that our patients raise their concerns with us so we can learn from them, and ensure the same doesn’t happen again.”</p>
