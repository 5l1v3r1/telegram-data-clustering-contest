      <h1>The Impact Of Shoptalk’s Bold Stance On Retail’s Female Leadership</h1>

      <p>In 2016, Retail Dive conducted a <a href="https://www.retaildive.com/news/why-retail-is-short-on-women-leadersand-what-retailers-can-do-about-it/416456/">deep analysis</a> to learn why there were so few female executives in the retail industry. Their findings were disheartening, to say the least. One study showed that 43% of the general public believed that women were underrepresented in all industries because they were held to higher standards; another 43% said that businesses were “not ready” to hire women leaders. Consider that in the business world women drive <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/diversity-inclusion/blog/top-10-things-everyone-know-women-consumers/">70-80% of all consumer purchasing</a> through a combination of their buying power and influence, yet women only hold 5.6% of CEO positions at retail companies in the S&amp;P 500. </p>
      <p>The analysis also stated that when it comes to purchasing power, women have a multiplier effect because they are often the caregivers for children or the elderly and therefore make purchasing decisions for people who live in their households or for extended family.</p>
      <p>Today, the landscape is looking a little brighter, with reports of a <a href="https://www.retail-week.com/retail-100/20-rise-in-female-leaders-in-the-retail-100-2019/7032185.article">20% increase in female leadership</a> in the Retail 100. However, the industry still has a long way to go and <a href="http://www.shoptalk.com/">Shoptalk</a> hopes to speed progress by drawing a line in the sand. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Shoptalk’s Big Announcement</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week, Shoptalk announced that 100% of its 2020 speakers will be women, sending a loud message to the retail industry. </p>
      <p>“100% puts a stake in the ground to say the industry needs to shift and now is the time to do it,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherwalton/2019/11/14/shoptalk-drops-the-hammer-by-announcing-100-of-shoptalk-2020-speakers-will-be-women/#5a9c63b6a218">said Shoptalk’s Chief Global Content Officer</a>, Zia Daniell Wiger. </p>
      <p>The event company already had sixty male speakers confirmed for 2020, when leaders made the decision to host an all-female program. The organizers reached out to those male executives and asked them to nominate a female from their company to speak in their place. To date, Shoptalk’s<a href="https://shoptalk.com/speakers"> 2020 lineup</a> includes female leaders from companies including Alibaba, Levi’s, Macy’s, and DSW.</p>
      <p>While gender diversity is certainly important in any industry, retail in particular might see a more significant impact. Here’s why:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Women Consumers Drive The Retail Industry</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since female consumers account for 70-80% of all spending in the United States and therefore have traditionally held the most buying power in the retail industry, tapping into the mindset of this influential demographic only makes business sense. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLyyYhw4Lec&amp;t=22s">2020 Shoptalk speaker</a>, Lihi Pinto Fryman, is a prime example of this. A few years back, she was a consumer looking for a particular red dress online, but was having trouble finding it. That’s when it occurred to her that searching by picture would be much more efficient than trying to explain the dress in a keyword search. She decided to put this idea to work and four years later, she is the co-founder and CMO of <a href="http://www.syte.ai/">Syte</a>, a technology company that provides visual search to some of the world’s largest retailers - enabling millions of dollars in commerce.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Shoptalk’s Statement Make An Impact?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some might say that Shoptalk’s women-only policy for 2020 is a little extreme. But <a href="https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/no-men-need-apply-shoptalk-conference-takes-all-female-route-marketers-brief/2214906">according to</a> the event’s Founder and President, Simran Rekhi Aggarwal, “Extreme problems require extreme solutions.”</p>
      <p>Shoptalk is the retail industry’s foremost conference, drawing over <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2019/03/14/shoptalk-2019-whats-next-for-retail/#46920dde4503">8,000 attendees</a>, 600 exhibitors, and top tier media. The early press coverage and social media conversations about their announcement has already made an impact by re-opening an important dialogue, which hopefully will continue. </p>
      <p>“I think every single industry can benefit from diversity, whether that be age, race or gender,” says Fryman. “At Syte, 50% of our workforce is female and that diversity allows a more complete view of a given problem or situation, sheds light on new angles, and keeps things interesting. And, above anything else, there are some very, very intelligent and thought provoking individuals out there that deserve to be heard.”</p>
      <p>At the very least, this bold statement about female leadership should cause managers, boards, and C-suite executives to think more holistically when it comes time for hiring, promoting, or electing. Given the profound impact that the small percentage of female leaders have already had on retail, Shoptalk did the industry a solid. </p>
