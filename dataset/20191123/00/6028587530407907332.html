      <p>Black Friday originated in America and has been the busiest shopping day of the year since 2005. The rest of the world has quickly caught on, and now Black Friday it is a global phenomenon.  This year, Black Friday officially lands on the 29th of November. However, Amazon and many others have stretched the period so it covers two Fridays—Friday November 22 to Friday November 29— so the shopping frenzy has started earlier and will last eight whole days!</p>
      <p>If you’ve been thinking about buying a VR headset for yourself or a loved one, now is the perfect time to get shopping. I’ve had a look around and gathered together a list of some of the best VR deals out there. So, what are you waiting for?!</p>
