      <p>As we’ve seen with Amazon, if you want the best deals on certain products you have to go directly to the company that makes them. That rule holds true for Google products, too. Google has discounted its latest phones, smart home tech and new gaming platform Stadia for Black Friday. Deals are available from November 24th, five days before Black Friday officially kicks off, but the Pixel-maker has given us an early look at what will be on offer. </p>
      <p>Whilst Walmart and Target offer increasingly large <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/17/20-best-black-friday-2019-phone--tech-deals-so-far/#359ddd7340da">“free” gift cards</a> with mobile phone purchases (which means you can get <i>a lot </i>of extra Black Friday tech for free), they come with lengthy contract plans - some of which are upwards of 34 months. Buying directly from manufacturers means you get good discounts on unlocked devices, which are better deals in my opinion. Here's the best of what's on offer at Google.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Phones</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/10/23/google-shouldve-been-braver-with-the-pixel-4/#82efe88372d7">read my thoughts on the XL here</a>) are a straight <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_4">$200 off</a> for unlocked devices (deal goes live November 24th). The other benefit of buying directly from the manufacturer is that there are trade-in deals available too. Google is offering (roughly) maximum $475 trade-in for your old phone - but you’ll only get that for the latest devices. A more realistic trade-in, the Pixel 2 XL, will yield $145 off, so you could feasibly get the Pixel 4 for $454. </p>
      <p>There’s also <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_3a">$100 off </a>this year’s Pixel 3A too, which is the budget -<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2019/11/16/why-you-should-wait-for-the-pixel-4a/#55c09e814598"> but very capable </a>- option. Google is still selling the Pixel 3 but as far as I can see, there’s no discount for last year’s device. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tech</b>
      </p>
      <p>Google has discounted virtually all of its latest smart home and gaming tech. The recently released game streaming service, Stadia, has <a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia">$80 off </a>for the starter kit. The Nest doorbell is also <a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia">$80 off,</a> whilst the impressive Nest Hub Max is <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub_max">$30 off</a> (the original Nest Hub has a better <a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_nest_hub">$80 off,</a> but the new device is more impressive). </p>
      <p>You can pick up the Nest thermostat for <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen">$70 off </a>and there are <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen">bundle options</a> available for outdoor Nest Cams, although details haven’t been released yet. </p>
      <p>Google typically offers some bundle options for devices that match up like the Nest Cam and Nest Hub, but I can’t see anything available yet. That may change when these deals go live or when Black Friday officially starts.</p>
