      <p>LAS VEGAS (AP) - A man who entered restricted areas at McCarran International Airport charged and assaulted officers without provocation before being shot and wounded by a police sergeant, a senior police official said Saturday.</p>
      <p>Police identified the man shot Thursday as 32-year-old <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jordan-henry/">Jordan Henry</a> and said he remained hospitalized in critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Police didn’t release a hometown for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jordan-henry/">Henry</a> but said he arrived on a Nov. 17 flight from Indianapolis and that he had a record of arrests in Indiana and Georgia.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jordan-henry/">Henry</a> was booked into jail in absentia on charges of two types of battery and of trespass. It wasn’t known whether he has an attorney who could comment on the allegations.</p>
      <p>Police body-camera video excerpts shown to reporters Saturday appeared to show that the first officer to encounter a man in a baggage-handling area used non-confrontational language before reaching for the man’s arm.</p>

      <p>The video then showed the man quickly pull away and turn toward another officer who was next visible on the ground next to a police vehicle.</p>
      <p>Officers chased the man on foot to another part of the airport until a second encounter when another officer was knocked to the ground before the man was shot by the sergeant, video shows.</p>
      <p>Assistant Sheriff Charles Hank said one injured officer had a broken nose, a broken finger and an orbital fracture, and Hank later said the man in the video was apparently holding an unopened soda can when first encountered by police.</p>
      <p>“He was very violent, very aggressive, in a rage, just extremely hostile, without any provocation from what we could see,” Hank said.</p>

        <p>Officers’ multiple attempts to use a stun gun to stop the man failed, Hank said.</p>
        <p>Hank said police first encountered <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/jordan-henry/">Henry</a> after officers responded to an airport employee’s report of a man going through a security door but then didn’t immediately find anybody in the immediate vicinity.</p>
