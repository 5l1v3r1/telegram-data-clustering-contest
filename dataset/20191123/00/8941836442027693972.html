      <p>CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - JaVaughn Craig threw three touchdowns and ran for two more and Austin Peay beat Eastern Illinois 35-7 for the Ohio Valley Conference championship on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Austin Peay (9-3, 7-1) owns the tiebreaker over Southeast Missouri State (9-3, 7-1) by virtue of its 28-24 win over the Redhawks on Oct. 12. Its only their second conference title, the last coming in 1977. The Governors - ranked No. 19 in FCS - set a single-season record for wins.</p>
      <p>Craig threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Baniko Harley with 4:51 left in the first quarter for the game’s first score. Darshon McCullough’s 47-yard TD run eight seconds into the second tied it up. Craig followed up with a 5-yard scoring run after a 5-play, 76-yard drive less than two minutes later. Then, his 19-yard touchdown run 68 seconds before halftime made it 21-7.</p>
