      <p>Health care will be a dominant campaign issue leading up to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections; the Democratic primary debates have made that clear. Yet, at least for another year, the most meaningful health care policy reforms will be coming out of state capitals.Health care costs for state governments, particularly Medicaid spending, are growing faster than all other categories of state spending. This is the case in the 36 states that have expanded their Medicaid programs in accordance with Obamacare, as well as the <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/status-of-state-medicaid-expansion-decisions-interactive-map/">14 states that have declined</a> to adopt Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. </p>
      <p>The share of total state spending consumed by Medicaid has risen by more than 36% over the past decade. Today nearly 29% of all state spending is consumed by Medicaid, up from 21.1% in <a href="https://higherlogicdownload.s3.amazonaws.com/NASBO/9d2d2db1-c943-4f1b-b750-0fca152d64c2/UploadedImages/SER%20Archive/Fiscal%202009%20State%20Expenditure%20Report.pdf">FY 2009</a>. The unsustainable trajectory of Medicaid spending is crowding out scarce taxpayer resources needed for education, transportation, other budgetary priorities, making it imperative for state lawmakers to find ways to reduce health care costs (while growth in state Medicaid spending has outpaced other budget categories in recent years, that changed in <a href="https://www.nasbo.org/reports-data/state-expenditure-report">Fiscal Year 2019</a>, when transportation spending saw the greatest growth rate).</p>

      <p>One of those 14 states that has declined to impose Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, Tennessee, is now seeking federal approval to implement the <a href="https://www.axios.com/tennessee-medicaid-block-grants-trump-33f8a27b-550b-49db-b206-ec8298ba20df.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=organic">nation’s first Medicaid block grant</a> in hopes to keep some of the billions in savings achieved through the Volunteer State’s successfully administered waiver of TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program. However, in order to address the increased direct costs to patients in the form of higher deductibles and co-pays, Tennessee legislators are busy cooking up complementary health care cost-cutting reforms to be taken up when state lawmakers return to Nashville in January for the 2020 legislative session.</p>
      <p>Representative Robin Smith (R-Tenn.) chairs the Insurance Committee in the Tennessee House of Representatives. The way she sees it, passage of Obamacare a decade ago and the experience that followed has proven that expanding access to health insurance does not guarantee access to affordable, quality care. That is why Representative Smith is making it her goal to have Tennessee lead the nation in the effort to tackle the root of the problem: rising costs.</p>
      <p>“First, health insurance is not health care. Health insurance is a financial product used to purchase health care at a contracted rate based on a large number of lives insured with the aim to prevent financial ruin – not practice medicine,” Representative Smith said. “Yet, in various policy arenas, the greatest energies are aimed almost exclusively on the contracted rates of care where buying power is leveraged via commercial health insurance, or government-run/funded health insurance programs like Medicare or Medicaid.”</p>
      <p>With this understanding, Chairman Smith and her colleagues in the Tennessee Legislature, working with Governor Bill Lee (R), are working on a legislative package for 2020 that will seek to expand access to health care through reforms designed to reduce the cost of care. Representative Smith and her colleagues will seek to do this not by simply throwing more people onto a traditionally structured government-run insurance plan where there is no ability to incentivize patients to make healthy choices or spend taxpayer dollars wisely. Federally, the Medicaid program is already approaching financial insolvency and will benefit from reforms that bend the health care cost curve by permitting increased market competition and consumer choice. </p>
      <p>“If leaders will work to bend the cost curve down of health care services, all payers – commercial insurance, government insurance, those without insurance and the self-insured – will benefit,” Chairman Smith added.</p>
      <p>One of the first steps state lawmakers can take to bend the health care cost curve is to reform or eliminate Certificate Of Need (CON) laws, which permit existing health institutions, such as hospitals, to essentially veto the application to the state for a competing entity to expand, make care-improving capital investments, or enter a market.</p>
      <p>“Certificate of need (CON) laws require competitors’ stamp of approval before providers can offer more health care services, such as opening a new hospital or new medical service,” <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/470316-cancer-therapy-dispute-highlights-need-to-repeal-con-laws">writes</a> Linsdsay Killen, vice president at the Michigan-based Mackinac Center, &amp; Naomi Lopez, director of health care policy at the Goldwater Institute, an Arizona-based think tank. “These <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/con-certificate-of-need-state-laws.aspx">decades-old laws</a>, established at a time when medical services were paid for by funding facilities rather than for services provided, long have been abandoned by most states. But these laws persist in Michigan and other states largely because they protect existing hospitals from new competitors.”</p>
      <p>According to Jordan Roberts — a health care policy analyst at the John Locke Foundation, a Raleigh-based think tank – sixteen states have fully repealed Certificate of Need laws “because of the demonstrated costs to patients and state-sanctioned benefits to incumbent facilities.” </p>
      <p>In 2016, Tennessee lawmakers first made limited reforms in its Certificate of Need laws. In the 2020 legislative session, additional CON reforms are expected to be introduced in state legislatures, including Tennessee’s. A working group of Tennessee Senators and Representatives has been meeting for six months, during which time they have discussed potential reforms to outdated state laws that protect market share for institutions and serve as unnecessary barriers for competition (competition that, if permitted, would ultimately bring down costs for consumers).</p>
      <p>In 2019, the Tennessee <a href="http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/apps/BillInfo/Default.aspx?BillNumber=HB0419">Right to Shop Act</a> was passed to increase medical price transparency. This was passed in Tennessee prior to President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/11/15/trump-administration-announces-historic-price-transparency-and-lower-healthcare-costs-for-all-americans.html">Executive Order</a> calling for transparency in medical pricing. The Tennessee pricing transparency bill, sponsored by Representative Smith, establishes that the insurance companies must publish certain prices of services for patients in advance of care. Representative Smith’s bill permits consumers to shop around and find the best value. </p>
      <p>The Tennessee House of Representatives also held a hearing this past year on a problem commonly referred to as “surprise billing,” looking at ways to address that issue. This issue is being debated in Washington, but it’s hard for many to see a productive solution to this problem coming out of this Congress. Solutions considered at the state level include some type of dispute resolution process between the insurance companies and the out-of-network providers who delivered care to the patient. Work is underway in Nashville to introduce legislation next year that seeks to protect patients from collections agencies and massive medical debt.</p>
      <p>Governor Bill Lee’s Medicaid block grant proposal, the first of its kind, is important, but it is likely to draw outsized attention relative to other meaningful reforms. </p>
      <p>“While the block grant waiver request in Tennessee is getting most of the news coverage, the health care delivery system for the 1.4 million patients in this population will not make the greatest impact on the cost of health care<i> </i>for the remaining 5.6 million citizens,” Chairman Smith said. “Price transparency, empowering patients and not just the insurance companies with information before care is delivered and increasing access and affordability through competition are priorities in Tennessee to put patients first and to spur innovation.”</p>
      <p>State legislatures have and are expected to continue taking advantage of Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-promoting-healthcare-choice-competition-across-united-states/">actions</a> that allow states to expand access to <a href="https://thefga.org/research/short-term-health-insurance-plans/">short-term plans</a> and <a href="https://thefga.org/research/association-health-plans-small-business/">association health plans</a> (AHPs), allowing small businesses to offer their employees health insurance at more affordable rates than those found in the individual and small group market. AHPs have the potential to help as many as <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-01/54915-New_Rules_for_AHPs_STPs.pdf">four million</a> Americans, who could see premiums up to <a href="https://thefga.org/research/association-health-plans-small-business/">$10,000 lower</a> annually than those on the individual market.</p>
      <p>Divided government in Washington makes state capitals the most feasible venue, at least in the near term, for testing out cost-cutting health care reforms and policy innovations. The way many policy experts and advocates see it, that’s optimal. </p>
      <p>“Democrats and Republicans have been debating health care reform for decades in Washington,” John Hood, chairman of the John Locke Foundation, <a href="https://www.robesonian.com/opinion/129010/states-should-lead-on-health-care">writes</a>. “It’s the wrong location. And which national plan to adopt is the wrong question.”</p>
      <p>For an example of how the U.S. could have a health care system in which costly regulations and mandates do not span a diverse continent, Hood points across the pond to the European nations that Bernie Sanders alludes too so frequently: </p>
      <p>“Why should America have a single approach to financing health care? In addition to its dubious constitutionality, such a policy prevents different states from pursuing different strategies in response to different circumstances and the preferences of their citizens,” Hood writes. “After all, ‘Europe’ has no single-payer plan. Separate European countries, most with populations comparable to American states, have adopted their own systems. Some have, indeed, set up government monopolies. Others use a mix of public and private providers.”</p>
      <p>Hood is joined by other policy experts who see value in moving the venue for health care reform from Washington to the states. </p>
      <p>“Perhaps it is time to look at more sensible approaches that decentralize power, moving it away from Washington through the states to individuals so we can get a properly functioning market working in our health sector, as the new <a href="https://galen.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c80eb2149ef4fa70ce2c72ef1&amp;id=c33966a4d6&amp;e=d075fbbf4f">Republican Study Committee plan</a> envisions, and as the Health Policy Consensus Group recommends with <a href="https://galen.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c80eb2149ef4fa70ce2c72ef1&amp;id=72cd5ef55e&amp;e=d075fbbf4f">Health Care Choices</a>,” Galen Institute president Grace-Marie Turner <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gracemarieturner/2019/11/02/theres-no-choice-but-to-move-on-with-health-reform/#7d31432a50dc">writes</a>. </p>
      <p>2020 presidential candidates, their campaign surrogates, and pundits will be talking about health care policy for the next year. While the campaign trail and halls of Congress will continue to feature a lot of talk about health care policy — as the hard work of Representative Smith and her colleagues (along with their counterparts in other state legislatures) demonstrates — the action on health care policy in the coming year will occur in state capitals, not Washington.</p>
