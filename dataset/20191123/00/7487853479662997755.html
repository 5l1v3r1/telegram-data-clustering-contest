      <h1>Frank Lampard Explains Why His Spell at Manchester City Helped Open Door to Managerial Career</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/12955694" target="_blank">Ben Carter</a></address>
      <p>​Frank Lampard claims that his one-season spell at Manchester City at the end of his playing career helped him to pave his way in management.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea boss is only in his second season as a head coach, but Lampard's side head into matchday 13 as the most in-form team in Europe's top five leagues - winning their last six games in a row in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Lampard, who actually scored against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">Chelsea</a> when he was on the books at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-city">Manchester City</a> as a player, returns to Etihad Stadium for the first time this weekend.</p>

      <p>And speaking ahead of the game, Lampard praised his time in the north-west for helping him transition into life as a manager.</p>
      <p>"The year in Manchester, in terms of what I'm doing here now, was perfect for me because it opened my eyes to another club, another structure, another dressing-room, another coaching philosophy, another idea," Lampard said, quoted by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7716389/Frank-Lampard-believes-one-season-Manchester-City-convinced-manager.html">The Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>"And then at New York [Red Bulls], again that continued and that starts to shape what you're thinking next.</p>
      <p>"At the time I was trying to look around me more and see things from a different side, which was less as a player and more about how I'd work with people around me.</p>
      <p>"I can't look back on my career now with any negative feelings even about leaving Chelsea now. I just look back with a thankful feeling that I had such a long career at great places."</p>
      <p>Lampard's managerial career started last season with Championship side <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/derby">Derby County</a>, where The Rams went on to reach the play-off final but ultimately fell short against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/aston-villa">Aston Villa</a>.</p>

      <p>Since taking over at Chelsea, who will be under a transfer ban until next summer, Lampard has lost five of his 19 games across all competitions - including the UEFA Super Cup against <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/liverpool">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>But the Blues have been one of the surprise packages in the Premier League this season and they could move four points clear of Manchester City this weekend.</p>
