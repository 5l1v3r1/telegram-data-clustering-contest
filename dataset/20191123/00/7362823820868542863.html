      <p>Authorities confirmed Friday that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/human-remains-found-on-missouri-farm-where-brothers-went-missing-police">human remains</a> found in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/missouri">Missouri</a> and Nebraska are those of two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> brothers who were last seen visiting a Missouri farm in July.</p>
      <p>The remains of Nicholas Diemel, 35, were found in Caldwell County, Mo, and those of Justin Diemel, 24, were recovered in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/nebraska">Lincoln, Neb</a>., the Caldwell County Sheriff's Office said. The identifications were made through dental records.</p>
      <p>Garland "Joey" Nelson is charged with first-degree murder in the death of the brothers. He owns the Caldwell County farm where the remains of Nicholas Diemel were found earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Nelson also faces two counts of abandonment of a corpse, two counts of tampering with physical evidence in a felony prosecution, two counts of armed criminal action, one count of first-degree tampering with a motor vehicle and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
      <p>A rancher in Nebraska reported last week that he'd found human remains mixed with dirt in a plastic tub inside a trailer he recently purchased in Missouri, <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article237682354.html">The Kansas City Star</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The brothers, from Shawano County, Wisc., disappeared during a trip related to their cattle business where they were supposed to meet Nelson, who allegedly owed them $250,000.</p>
      <p>Investigators found the brothers' rental truck on July 22 in Holt, Mo., a town 35 miles west of Braymer, where Nelson's farm is located. It was left running with the lights on.</p>
      <p>Blood found on Nelson's clothing was confirmed to be from Nicholas Diemel, <a href="https://fox4kc.com/2019/11/22/remains-found-in-caldwell-county-and-nebraska-identified-as-murdered-wisconsin-brothers/">WDAF-TV</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors allege Nelson shot the brothers and then abandoned their vehicle. He admitted to taking their cell phones and throwing them away, according to the news station.</p>
      <p>Nelson allegedly placed each man in a 55-gallon metal barrel in a barn on his property, court documents said. He then allegedly moved the bodies and set them on fire and hid the remains.</p>
      <p>The investigation into the brothers' deaths is ongoing, the Caldwell County Sheriff’s Office said.</p>
