      <p>In major European football league matches played on Saturday, spectators and viewers around the world including in Nigeria were treated to all sorts of experience – good, bad and ugly.</p>
      <p>For example, in the widely followed English Premier League, table toppers – Liverpool – fought a resilient Crystal Palace team to walk away 2-1 winners at the end of 90 minutes to keep their title hopes alive.</p>
      <p>Goals from Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino delivered the maximum points for Jurgen Klopp’ side after Wilfried Zaha had scored an equaliser late in the second half.</p>
      <p>In other parts of England, Leicester City where Nigeria’s Wilfred Ndidi is an integral member of the team, thrashed Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2-0 courtesy of goals from Ayoze Perez and Jamie Vardy.</p>
      <p>But it was a different story for Arsenal Football Club of London as their troubles on the pitch continued on Saturday after they were held to a draw at home by Southampton.</p>
      <p>The result could have been worse for Unai Emery’s side had the visitors converted all their chances inside the 18-yard box.</p>
      <p>It took the artistry of Alexandre Lacazette late in extra-time to score the equalising goal for Arsenal and grab a point for them.</p>
      <p>Following the team’s poor performance in recent times, Emery had come under intense pressure with many of the fans already losing faith in him and his ability to deliver long-awaited success after the departure of Arsene Wenger last season.</p>
      <p>In Spain and Italy, Barcelona and Juventus both ground out important wins away from home against Laganes and Atalanta respectively despite strong resistance from their opponents.</p>
      <p>Goals from Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 win over the host team while a double from Gonzalo Higuain and one from Paulo Dybala saw Juventus come from behind to emerge victorious.</p>
      <p>Most top sides in Europe’s biggest football leagues were all busy on Saturday as a result of the resumption of the Champions League and Europa League between Tuesday and Thursday. </p>
