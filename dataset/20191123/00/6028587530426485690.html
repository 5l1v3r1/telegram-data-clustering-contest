      <p>Good morning, after pretty much a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2019/11/22/destiny-2-is-still-down-but-a-fix-is-incoming/">full day offline</a>, <i>Destiny 2</i> is back in business. Late last night, Bungie announced that servers were back online and all the various errors players were getting (weasel, stork) were banished.Fans were perplexed when yesterday turned into a total wash for the game, with <i>Destiny 2 </i>being unexpectedly offline for something like 15+ hours in total, one of the longest outages I have seen for the game that wasn’t planned for cross save prep or something like that. Stranger still, the outage also affected <i>Destiny 1</i>, and players couldn’t get into any game in the series.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, not really all that much is happening in <i>Destiny 2 </i>right now. We are in the final few weeks of the season, and most of the major events have passed, with this past week being the (rather lackluster) arrival of the Undying Mind. The only thing planned for Friday really was the usual arrival of Xur, which was delayed because of the issue, but I suppose there could have been worse times for the game to decide to totally crap out.</p>
      <p>It’s still not exactly clear what happened here to cause a problem of this scale. Bungie is usually pretty transparent about stuff like this, so I would expect them to have some sort of overview in a future TWAB once they investigate it fully. All Bungie Help said yesterday night was that they “identified the core issue” that was messing everything up, which prompted them to issue downtime to fix it.</p>

      <p>I joked yesterday that I demanded 10 Ascendant Shards for this outage, but this isn’t <i>Fortnite </i>and we usually don’t get rewards for downtime, so no, I’m not expecting any recompense. I wasn’t even planning on playing<i> Destiny 2</i> yesterday, I was <i>Borderlands </i>Mayhem 4 boss farming all day.</p>
      <p>Given that the end of the season is nigh, we should probably start hearing about what Bungie has planned for the next season, which should start in mid-December, either this week or certainly the next, as it’s getting perilously close. I have <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/11/21/here-are-my-moderate-expectations-for-destiny-2s-season-of-the-dawn/">listed my own thoughts</a> about what I’m expecting from the next season, which frankly, is not all that much, based on what you get when you extract the Season of the Undying stuff from the Shadowkeep stuff that was released this season. Trials is probably the biggest question mark, as it’s not clear if that activity is ready to return yet. I’m leaning toward yes, but we’ll see.</p>
      <p>Anyway, strange day yesterday, and hopefully we don’t see another one of those for a while. Log in, do what you gotta do.</p>
