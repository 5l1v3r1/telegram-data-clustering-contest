        <b>In a game where the final 10 minutes really judged the result, Liverpool came away from Selhurst Park victorious and Crystal Palace once again fail to get any points from the game.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A very exciting game saw<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/liverpool/"> Liverpool</a> come away with the three points and <b>keep their gap at the top of the Premier League table.</b> Roy Hodgson's team needed a win today to pick up points and <b>take them further up the table than 13th.</b></p>
      <p>The home side got the game underway and they sure did come out fighting!<b> They knew that they had to be at their best</b> against league leaders Liverpool. No real shots were had until the 16th minute, when <b>Townsend snuck the ball in for Ayew</b>, but his shot went just wide of the post. They really did look a threat to the Reds from the get go! </p>
      <p><b>Tomkins came closest to getting on the scoresheet</b> as a free kick on the right wing was passed in for him and he just managed to get his head on it, but<b> his shot hit the crossbar! </b></p>
      <p>Liverpool weren't at their best and although they had some shots,<b> they couldn't make anything count.</b></p>
      <p>The first goal came in the 42nd minute. <b>Tomkins</b> put the home side in the lead after a <b>headed the ball in the back of the net </b>after a cross in from a free kick. However, the goal was <b>disallowed by VAR </b>after it was checked and not allowed as <b>Lovren went down </b>in the box before the ball hit the back of the net! Disappointing for Palace, as this did not affect the goal at all, now<b> more controversy regarding VAR</b> in the Premier League! </p>
      <p>The referee blew the whistle for half time and <b>Hodgson went into the break happy</b> with what his team have produced, they looked threatening and would have been disappointed with the disallowed goal. <b>Liverpool needed to up their game</b> a little if they were going to take home the three points!</p>

      <p>And that they did, as their first goal came just after the break. It was <b>a rather unlucky goal</b> for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a> to concede, as <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-mane-138826">Mane</a> had a shot at goal, the keeper got a hand to it but it <b>bounced off the far post </b>and to the near post, then rolled into the back of the net. This set the scoring underway and <b>put the Reds in the lead! </b></p>
      <p>Palace reacted well to going behind and<b> fought hard to get themselves back in the game</b>. After a few substitutions from both sides, their equaliser finally came in the 81st minute. A lot of good play and passes in the box saw <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/w-zaha-70052/">Zaha</a> receive the ball, he controlled it brilliantly and <b>confidently put it just before the far post </b>and into the back of the net. It was all to play for after this, in the last ten minutes! <b>Selhurst Park</b> was buzzing.</p>
      <p>However, <b>Liverpool were not finished there</b> and<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/r-firmino-95323/"> Firmino</a> sealed the win for the away side. A <b>scuffle at the near post </b>with the ball, as it was crossed in from the corner and <b>Crystal Palace tried to clear it</b>, only for Firmino to get to it first and poke it into the back of the net.<b> </b>This made the <b>last ten minutes very interesting.</b></p>
      <p>There was <b>a big rush after this for Palace to get a goal,</b> but with Klopp also bringing Firmino off and replacing him with Gomez,<b> a defensive change</b>, the game finished <b>1-2. </b></p>
      <p>A game that was principally based on <b>action in the last ten minutes</b>. Palace will go away disappointed as they definitely deserved to get something out of the game and you can see how deflated the players were as they fell to the ground in disappointment. <b>Liverpool's unbeaten streak continues</b> and Palace fail to win anymore points. </p>
