      <p>Diawara totaled 21 points and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-perry/">Perry</a> added 20 as the Hatters shot 49% from the field (20-41) while limiting Monmouth to 21-of-54 shooting (39%). Diawara was 8 of 11 from the floor while <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rob-perry/">Perry</a> made 6 of 11, draining 3 of 6 from deep.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/stetson/">Stetson</a> (3-3) had a 31-14 advantage at the break.
