      <h1>Celtics guard Walker discharged from hospital</h1>

      <p>Kemba Walker has been discharged from hospital and will be assessed again on Saturday after suffering "concussion-like symptoms" in Boston Celtics' defeat to the Denver Nuggets.</p>
      <p>The three-time All-Star point guard was wheeled off on a stretcher at the Pepsi Center following a collision with his team-mate Semi Ojeleye on Friday.</p>
      <p>Walker was treated for more than eight minutes on court after ploughing into Ojeleye's midriff head first.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old underwent tests at Denver Hospital, but was allowed to rejoin his team-mates before they returned to Boston.</p>
      <p>Walker will face further checks ahead of an NBA meeting with the Sacramento Kings at TD Garden on Monday.</p>
      <p>Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said after his side's 96-92 loss: "It's tough on both teams to see that.</p>
      <p>"And it was good to get at least early reports of good news from our standpoint.</p>
      <p>"But the head injury thing is super scary, and - so you're always thinking about it, and you still have to play the last 27 minutes, which is not a fun part of it, but I thought our guys and Denver competed really hard the rest of the game."</p>
