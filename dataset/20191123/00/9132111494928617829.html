      <p>Ghanaians on social media have been thrown into a public divide following a video purporting to unmask the identity of ace investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas.</p>
      <p>The video captures a well-built man with braided hair being confronted by another for attempting to claim the latter’s entitled land.</p>
      <p>The visibly upset looking man is heard shouting the journalist’s name questioning his authenticity.</p>
      <p>“He said he’s Anas Aremeyaw. He’s coming to claim. Today I’ve got Anas. Somebody has title, you’re coming to claim that you’re Anas Aremeyaw Anas,” he’s heard yelling.</p>
      <p>Although several people including media personality, Nana Aba Anamoah have refuted claims that the man in the said video is investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas, the debate refuses to die down.</p>
      <p>www.ghanaweb.com brings you a transcript of the conversation in the said video which is in Hausa.</p>
      <p><b>Man in white:</b> Do you know me?</p>
      <p><b>Alleged Anas:</b> Listen, will it be okay for you if I am killed?</p>
      <p>After man in white announced “listen everyone this is Anas Aremeyaw so record I and him.”</p>
      <p><b>Alleged Anas:</b> You want people to kill me. I am talking to you but you don’t want to listen.</p>
      <p><b>Man in the background:</b> He is not Anas.</p>
      <p><b>Alleged Anas:</b> I am still pleading but you don’t want to listen.</p>
      <p><b>Man in brown:</b> So you don’t want to be killed.</p>
      <p><b>Man in background:</b> Massa, it is not a fight.</p>
      <p><b>Man in white:</b> What you are doing is wrong.</p>
      <p><b>Another man in background:</b> No one is going to touch him so don’t pretend like you are separating a fight.</p>
