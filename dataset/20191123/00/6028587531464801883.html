      <p><i>Destiny </i>and <i>Destiny 2 </i>remain down Friday evening after an entire day of server issues and outages.The servers went down early this morning a little after 7 am ET and players have been reporting issues logging into the game ever since. Players across all platforms, from PC to Stadia to consoles have faced issues with the game Friday.</p>
      <p>There is good news, however!</p>
      <p>Bungie has identified the problem and <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1198032135304564736">taken the games offline completely</a> in an effort to implement a fix. They have not shared what the problem is, however–it could be a DDOS attack or something else entirely.</p>
      <p>Bungie says that it will slowly add players into queues in order to not overload the servers once the game is back online. They’re targeting 7 pm PT.</p>
      <p>Bungie’s support Twitter reported that they’d identified the problem just about an hour ago:</p>
      <p>They tweeted the 7 pm PT target time half an hour later:</p>
      <p>We’ll keep a close eye on the status of <i>Destiny </i>and <i>Destiny 2 </i>this evening and see if they actually do come back online, or whether the problem extends indefinitely. Cross your fingers.</p>
