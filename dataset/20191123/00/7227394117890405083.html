      <h1>Visionox introduces a foldable clamshell smartphone and rollable OLED panel</h1>

      <p>During the First World Conference on Display Industry in China, Visionox showcased two new interesting products - a foldable clamshell smartphone and a rollable OLED panel hinting at even more interesting designs in the next one or two years. And just a quick reminder - this is the company that supplies the futuristic panel for the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_mix_alpha-9893.php">Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha</a>.</p>
      <p>The foldable clamshell prototype that was shown on site looks a lot like the new <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_2019-9630.php">Motorola Razr 2019</a> but when you look closely, the design looks more polished and resembles a normal handset from 2019. The AMOLED display used for the prototype is 6.47" big with on-cell technology. It folds inwards in the middle but more importantly, Visionox promises that there will be no crease in the middle when the technology reaches a final product.</p>

      <p>And as for the rollable AMOLED, Visionox showcased a flexible panel that can be rolled within a 7mm radius. Furthermore, the panel features on-cell display technology and self-lamination. However, this particular prototype is still far from being implemented into a final product, hence why the company showcased only the display itself without being slapped on an actual handset.</p>
