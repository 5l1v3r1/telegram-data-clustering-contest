      <h1>Maiden Test century &amp;#039;a dream come true&amp;#039; for Labuschagne</h1>

      <p>Marnus Labuschagne said scoring his first Test century was a dream come true, although the Australia batsman's celebration was not as he envisaged on day three against Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne struck a magnificent career-best 185 on his home ground after David Warner was dismissed for 154 on another dominant day for Tim Paine's side at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>Pakistan closed on 64-3 in their second innings, trailing by 276 and facing a heavy defeat in the first match of the series in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Labuschagne was on cloud nine after reaching three figures for the first time in the longest format.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's a dream come true. It was set up by the boys at the start and I was able to capitalise on that.</p>
      <p>"It's a privilege to play with this hat on and ... if I can score runs along the way, that's great."</p>
      <p>The South Africa-born 25-year-old spoke of his relief at bringing up his hundred, hence his reaction to reaching the landmark.</p>
      <p>"You don't want to drift, you try and stay in the moment, but you can't help but think 'imagine if you get your first Test century, home ground...' said Labuschagne.</p>
      <p>"It was amazing. Leading up to when I got it, I was sort of thinking 'stay patient, they are going to come, you'll get your shot'. I said to myself if it's up there and it's full I'm going to have a crack at it. </p>
      <p>"It was greedy, I tried to go too square and got a thick edge through the gully region and then it was just looking back to see it just trickle along the ground and I thought 'thank you'. </p>
      <p>"You always think as a kid, how am I going to celebrate a hundred? That was nothing like I thought, my emotion took over, it was very exciting and a dream come true."</p>
