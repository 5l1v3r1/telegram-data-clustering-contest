      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) - Temple coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-mckie/">Aaron McKie</a> might want to think about bringing his team out to California more often.</p>
      <p>The Owls made their first trip to California in 14 years a successful one as they rallied in the second half for a 70-61 victory over Southern California on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“It’s really nice to come back and get a win,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-mckie/">McKie</a>, who spent two years with the Lakers before moving into the coaching ranks.</p>
      <p>Josh Pierre-Louis led Temple (4-0) with 15 points while Quinton Rose and Justyn Hamilton each added 12.</p>
      <p>The Trojans trailed 31-30 at halftime but scored the first eight points of the second half to take their largest lead. But the Owls would respond with a 26-8 run over the next eight minutes to take control.</p>

      <p>Temple was 10 of 18 from the field, including four 3-pointers as it held a 55-44 advantage with 8:45 remaining. De’Vondre Perry scored eight points during the run while Nate Pierre-Louis and Quinton Rose had five each.</p>
      <p>“We were able to get pressure and take them out of rhythm. We started to get out in transition and get easy baskets,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-mckie/">McKie</a> said.</p>
      <p>USC got within 66-61 with 48 seconds remaining but could not draw closer. Onyeka Okongwu led the Trojans (5-1) with 17 points and Ethan Anderson added 12.</p>
      <p>“We shot a low percentage (38.6%). We have to play better offensively, shoot the ball and move the ball,” coach Andy Enfield said. “No one stepped up. We weren’t sharp in a lot of areas.”</p>

        <p>Temple led by as many as nine in the first half and was up 29-22 with 3:01 remaining on Josh Pierre-Louis’ layup before the Trojans scored eight straight points. Isaiah Mobley’s layup with 16 seconds remaining gave USC its first lead (31-30) but the Owls would take the lead into the locker room at halftime after Pierre-Louis got a steal under the Temple basket and made a layup at the buzzer.</p>
        <p>KEY STAT</p>
        <p>USC had been dominating on the boards early in the season and had a size advantage over Temple, but the Owls had a 42-38 rebounding advantage. Nate Pierre-Louis had 10 rebounds for Temple, all on the defensive end.</p>
        <p>“We’re tough. We’re from Broad Street. This is what we’re going to do,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-mckie/">McKie</a> said.</p>
        <p>The Trojans came in averaging 14.6 offensive rebounds per game but were held to six.</p>
        <p>“We have too much size and athleticism to only have six offensive rebounds,” Enfield said.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p>Temple: The Owls came into the game second in the nation in steals (12.3 per game). They had eight against USC, which was a huge reason why they scored 21 points off turnovers.</p>
        <p>“We don’t necessarily look to get steals. We want to certainly apply pressure and its been happening,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/aaron-mckie/">McKie</a> said. “I feel if we keep people in front of us we will be solid.”</p>
        <p>USC: Nick Rakocevic came in with three straight double-doubles in points and rebounds but struggled. The senior center was held to six points, going 2 of 7 from the field, and six rebounds.</p>
