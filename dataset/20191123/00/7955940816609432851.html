      <h2>Council says the parking bye laws must be changed first</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Meara</a></address>
      <p>Owners of electric cars (EVs) should have two hours to charge their vehicles at Kildare County Council operated car parks.</p>
      <p>This, Cllr Bill Clear told a Naas Municipal District meeting, would be in the interests of addressing climate change and “we should try to encourage it.”</p>
      <p>As already reported Sallins woman Emma Priest received two parking tickets for charing her car at two Naas car parks without buying a ticket. Although Kildare County Council have since waived their fines.</p>
      <p>At the same time insisting that an offence was committed and that fines would be issued in the future to car owners who have not bought a ticket to park.</p>
      <p>Cllr Clear has sought to have the bye-laws which govern how the pay parking system operates reviewed.</p>
      <p>“It is now past the mid term point of the current bye-laws, “ he said. He also stated there are a number of other parking issues to be addressed in Naas.</p>
      <p>Free parking is allowed outside Super Valu store at Fairgreen at times when school buses are not using the parking bay.</p>
      <p>Cllr Clear also said that a similar regime applies at Sallins Road - but once people see that they can park there sometimes the area becomes congested.</p>
      <p>“At times people are parked there and the buses can’t pull in,” he added.</p>
      <p>He also said that parking charges in some areas, like victoria Terrace, are excessive.</p>
      <p>However KCC says a review of any parking bye-law should not take place unless “there are significant amendments proposed such as extending enforcement days, times and significantly extending the area of enforcement.”</p>
      <p>The council also suggested that a review should not start for at least five years “since the commencement of its enforcement.”</p>
      <p>The meeting was also told that any review of any parking bye-law may also incor unnecessary significant costs.</p>
