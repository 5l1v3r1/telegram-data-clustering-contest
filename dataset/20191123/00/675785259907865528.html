      <p>"He was one of the first actors I knew I had to work with as soon as I got my first film off the ground. He will be missed. I can’t believe all three of my friends in this picture are now gone."</p>
      <p>Pollard was born in Passaic, New Jersey in 1939 to Polish parents, with his father working 60 hours a week as a bartender to support the family.</p>

      <p>He gained a reputation for playing youthful roles, as his 'baby face' looks allowed him to play teenagers when he was well into his twenties.</p>
      <p>This included starring in the a 1966 episode of Star Trek, called Miri, in which he played the teenage leader of an all-child planet.</p>
      <p>Pollard won a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles for his performance in Bonnie and Clyde and a year later, his popularity was such that he jokingly entered the race to become President of the United States.</p>
