      <p><i>Jahangir claimed to be the ‘second richest person’ in Bengaluru and women fell for it</i> <br/><br/>The Halasuru Police arrested a man who posed as a rich businessman and cheated and raped several women. <br/><br/>Claiming to be the son of a MLA, Jahangir alias Karthik Reddy alias Karthik alias Kiran Reddy, a 30-year-old MBA graduate, used to tell his victims that he was the second richest person in Bengaluru and owned hotels, hospitals, jewellery stores and media houses. Jahangir is a resident of Srirangam in Tamil Nadu. <br/><br/>He would take his victims in high end cars and make them book expensive hotel rooms with their credit cards. He would then rape them there. Jahangir would make the women buy him expensive gifts and then flee. <br/><br/>Cases against him have been registered in various police stations in Bengaluru and Tamil Nadu. The police recovered a car with a Tamil Nadu registration, mobile phones and other valuables. <br/><br/><br/>He was active since 2017 and would target victims who were alone near malls and strike up a conversation with them. Jahangir would promise them jobs at his firms and assume an alias every time. <br/><br/>“He told one of his victims that his father was a MLA and his mother a doctor. In one instance, Jahangir met a victim at a hotel on MG Road and took her to Kadubisanahalli and raped her. He promised another woman that he would make her a model-cum-actress and sexually assaulted her,” said a police officer. <br/><br/><br/>Police suspect that there may be more victims. Jahangir has two cases registered against him in Chennai. Cases of rape (IPC 376), cheating (IPC 420) along with other sections have been registered against him.</p>
