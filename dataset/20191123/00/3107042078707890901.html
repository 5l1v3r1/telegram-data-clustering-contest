      <p>The New Zealand Deerstalkers Association (NZDA) is demanding answers over the scheduling of some West Coast 1080 drops, saying fawns could starve if the poison drops go ahead.</p>
      <p>The NZDA, the country's leading hunting organisation, said yesterday it had become aware of several applications from Ospri and the Department of Conservation to use aerial 1080 in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>A 1080 drop is scheduled to begin today in the Kahurangi area, and it was understood another operation is due to begin soon in the Landsborough valley in South Westland.</p>
      <p>The NZDA is condemning the planned poisoning.</p>
      <p>NZDA national president Trevor Chappell said the timing was unacceptable.</p>
      <p>"These drops coincide with late spring when deer are giving birth to their fawns and that means not only are the mothers at risk of dying a painful death if they eat the 1080, the orphaned fawns will be left to starve to death," he said.</p>
      <p>"This is just not on. This is a major animal welfare issue for deer and if these government organisations want to be seen as humane, they should not be conducting mass poisoning campaigns at this time of year."</p>
      <p>In previous years, mass poisoning operations had finished by this time, he said.</p>
      <p>The tahr cull was halted from November to prevent orphaned kids starving to death in the mountains.</p>
      <p>Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage told RNZ there was a crisis for native species due to the mega mast this year.</p>
      <p>The alternatives to fawns dying was birds being killed, she said.</p>
      <p>It was spending $250,000 on deer repellent in the Cobb Valley and Kahurangi.</p>
      <p>When asked if the drops could wait, she pointed out the huge number of rats which washed up on Westport beach.</p>
      <p>They had to use fine weather windows, she said.</p>
      <p>Game Animal Council chairman Don Hammond said it supported efforts to protect native birds.</p>
      <p>"We are not promoting 1080 but understand the need."</p>
      <p>It was working with Doc regarding deer repellent.</p>
