        <b>Arsenal manager Unai Emery and his players were booed off despite Alexandre Lacazette's 96th-minute equaliser denying Southampton a first win at the Gunners since 1987 in a pulsating 2-2 draw at the Emirates on Saturday.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Emery</b>'s chances of remaining in charge<b> fade with every passing week </b>as a point at home to a side languishing in the relegation zone does little to<b> further his side's chances of achieving a top-four finish.</b></p>
      <p>The Spaniard has<b> received a vote of confidence</b> from the board of a club that does not often fire managers, but <b>many fans had already lost faith in him </b>before this setback.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-lacazette-81110/">Lacazette</a>'s goal, his second of the match, at least <b>avoided an embarrassing defeat</b>, but<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/"> Arsenal</a> <b>have won just two of their last 11 </b>Premier League games and slip down to <b>seventh in the table</b> behind Wolves and Burnley.</p>
      <p>Despite their lowly status,<b> Southampton were the better side </b>and peppered the Arsenal goal with 21 shots to the home side's 12.</p>
      <p><b>Stuart Armstrong</b> flashed an early Southampton opportunity narrowly wide but Arsenal didn't heed the warning and were <b>caught out by a ninth-minute free-kick.</b></p>
      <p>Nathan Redmond, the man fouled, was still on the ground when <b>Ryan Bertrand played it quickly to Danny Ings</b>, who strode into space on the leftbefore unleashing a low drive that went past goalkeeper<b> Bernd Leno</b> and in off a post.</p>
      <p>That prompted boos from some home fans but the mood was in no way lightened by Southampton's <b>James Ward-Prowse</b> firing the game's next chance straight at Leno.</p>

      <p><b>Lacazette changed the narrative with an equaliser</b> in the 18th minute. Mesut Ozil's cross from the left found <b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang </b>in space in the box and although Bertrand blocked his shot the rebound fell to the France striker to fire home on the turn.</p>
      <p><b>The second half was frantic from the start</b> as Leno had to make a save from team-mate <b>Lucas Torreira</b>, who poked the ball towards his own goal in the act of dispossessing the lively <b>Michael Obafemi.</b></p>
      <p>Southampton then<b> survived a VAR check</b> for a penalty when Armstrong stuck up a hand to stop the ball smashing him in the face.</p>
      <p>Arsenal's club record signing <b>Nicolas Pepe started on the bench </b>for the third straight game, but looked lively after being introduced at half-time and hit the bar with an acrobatic back-post effort that reared up off the turf.</p>
      <p>But<b> it was the visitors who continued to pose the greater threat</b> and they were awarded a penalty when <b>Kieran Tierney pushed Ings over</b> to stop him reaching a dangerous <b>Obafemi </b>cross. Ward-Prowse's first effort was saved by Leno, but he made it 2-1 on the rebound.</p>
      <p><b>Joe Willock</b> then prevented Saints replacement<b> Moussa Djenepo</b> from wrapping up victory with a block of a goalbound shot, with Djenepo firing wide from just seven yards out during seven minutes of added time.</p>
      <p>Those misses <b>proved to be costly </b>as Arsenal substitute <b>Gabriel Martinelli found Lacazette unmarked</b> at the back post for a smart finish and an undeserved equaliser with virtually the last kick of the game.</p>
