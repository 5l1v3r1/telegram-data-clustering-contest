      <p>Foundation for the Education of Needy Children in Fiji has received a donation of $13,000 from Burger King at its flagship restaurant in Martintar, Nadi.</p>
      <p>While accepting the donation, FENC Fiji financial controller Priya Lata says the donation and continued support from Burger King will go a long way in assisting them to make education accessible to the poorest of the poor children of Fiji while enabling them to break the cycle of poverty and become resourceful citizens of Fiji.</p>
      <p>She says the $8,000 donation which was received from Burger King in June this year was used to assist 75 children living at the Koroipita settlement in Lautoka.</p>
      <p>Lata adds the money from the current donation will be used to purchase school supplies for children who are listed with them for the 2020 school term.</p>
      <p>She revealed that Burger King is the largest annual committed donor for 2019. </p>
      <p>Burger King General Manager Akash Narsey says they are proud to have been able to collect the money that FENC Fiji will use to assist children of impoverished backgrounds for their educational needs.</p>
      <p>He says education is a key element in escaping poverty which is what initially drove them to partner with FENC Fiji.</p>
      <p>Narsey thanked the people of Fiji and all those who have contributed to their donation boxes in Burger King restaurants for their generous support.</p>
      <p>Burger King has been working closely with the Foundation for the Education of Needy Children in Fiji since 2016 to support the educational needs of deprived children across the country and has contributed almost $70,000 so far.</p>
