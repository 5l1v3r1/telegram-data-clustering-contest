      <h1>Jose Mourinho Might Be Seen as the Unchangeable One – But His New Spurs Side Look Different</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/10361186" target="_blank">Ben Haines</a></address>
      <p><b>From the London Stadium –</b>Jose Mourinho brought up a lot of talking points in his opening press conference as Spurs manager this week, but the main one wasn't about his Champions League record; or the softness of the pillows at his new hotel – it was that despite the humble nod to Mauricio Pochettino's style, his Tottenham side will be different. </p>
      <p>If you want to break things down tactically after his first match – a 3-2 win over West Ham at the London Stadium – you could look at the fact that Spurs moved to three at the back when in possession, with Serge Aurier playing further forward and Ben Davies making up a three-man defence.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, you could look at the swagger that Spurs rediscovered going forward. They played with confidence, creating chances far more frequently, and had a real injection of energy thanks to Son on one wing, Lucas on the other, some much-needed pace coursing through the team. There was no reemergence of the 'press from the front mentality' that made Tottenham the side they were three years ago, but instead they showed off a more measured and considered shape.</p>

      <p>They weren’t afraid to be more direct when under pressure. It would be unfair to say that Spurs were shackled by Pochettino's intention to play out from the back, but it never felt like that the ability to lift the ball long was off the table when under pressure against West Ham. A number of times, when faced with awkward situations under pressure in their own half, the ball was clipped toward Harry Kane some 40 yards away. The success rate of the long ball wasn't high, but it gave the defence room to breathe. </p>
      <p>Eric Dier was restored to the team in front of the defence, too. That wasn't surprising to see, Mourinho being a long-time admirer of the central midfielder, but in truth Dier didn’t have a stormer of an afternoon. He was physical and covered a decent amount of ground, but his passing – perhaps the reason he was being left out under Pochettino – was again a little off.</p>
      <p>Most notably, Dele Alli was different. He was thrust further forward in a position which he suits best and – not coincidentally – which suits <i>him </i>best; stretching the defensive line by playing off the shoulder of the last man, then suddenly dropping in slightly deeper toward midfield to create space between the lines. </p>
      <p>He found himself with five yards of space at least four times in the first half alone, playing delicate passes through to set up a teammate – most notably to set up Son for the opener.</p>

      <p>West Ham rallied late on and got a well deserved consolation goal from Antonio who – if fully fit – could have had an even bigger impact on the game. Things then got a little bit more uncomfortable when Ogbonna brought the Irons back to within one, with a lack of confidence at the back still lingering from those times all of, erm, days ago when Pochettino was in charge. </p>
      <p>In truth, West Ham were probably a perfect first game. Struggling for form, without their first choice goalkeeper and with a very subdued atmosphere in the stands, they struggled to gain a foothold in the game as Rice and Noble were overrun in midfield; Cresswell and Fredericks unable to help them as Son and Lucas pinned them back. </p>
      <p>But even still, credit must go to the Tottenham front line, who took their chances and never looked more than a well-timed pass or run away from scoring again.</p>

      <p>It will be interesting to see what Mourinho does with the Tottenham defence in the coming weeks, and which players cement a place in his front four. We’ll find out what home comforts he’ll keep hold of and what he might look to refurbish when Spurs face Olympiakos in the Champions League on Tuesday night. </p>
      <p>One thing that <i>is</i> for certain is that if Mourinho can keep winning, the Tottenham fans will be infinitely more likely to get behind whatever changes there are.</p>
