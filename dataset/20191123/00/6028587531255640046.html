      <p>Consumers, especially younger ones, are losing trust in paid influencers and looking instead to organic grassroots communities where their like-minded peers are sharing content and commentary about brands and products they actually love. Savvy retailers and brands are evolving their influencer marketing to meet consumers’ changing expectations and looking for more authentic engagement models that tap the true voice of consumers to unearth new insights they can use to develop new products and boost engagement and sales.We recently had the opportunity to connect with Amber Atherton, CEO at Zyper, a community marketing platform that connects brands with the top 1% of their superfans. As backlash against traditional influencer models continues to grow, brands are turning to solutions like Zyper. We sat down with Amber ahead of her “Social Media Influencers in 2019: Evolving or Over?” presentation at Salesforce Dreamforce 2019 to discuss the state of influencer marketing and what retailers and brands should consider when building more authentic engagement and community-based brand advocacy programs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Greg Petro: There has been a lot of controversy lately over the effectiveness of influencers and how fraud is becoming a billion-dollar problem for the retail industry. Why have consumers become disengaged from influencers?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Amber Atherton:</b> After years of influencers buying fake followers, hiring click farms and promoting products that they don’t even use, consumers feel that they can’t trust much of what influencers say. People can easily see whether an influencer honestly cares about a brand or product, and they’re asking, “Why should I listen to this person who’s just promoting things for the money?”</p>
      <p>Instead, consumers are looking to engage with authentic people whose authentic product recommendations they can trust. What we’re seeing is today’s consumers, particularly Gen Zers, gravitating toward more grassroots communities, where people share information and original content about the brands and products they love with others they have a close relationship and something in common with. This is opening up new opportunities for brands to connect with existing customers who genuinely love their products by building strong online brand communities.</p>
      <p>Brands are now looking for ways to spark more meaningful conversations with their fans, while also tapping into the voice of those customers to unearth new product and purchase insights that can boost sales and drive new category product development.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Greg Petro: If Gen Z consumers are no longer turning to influencers for product recommendations, what is the biggest influence for them today?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Amber Atherton:</b> Gen Zers are influenced by authentic content provided by people they trust, and they are looking to members of the small, tight-knit online communities they’re part of for information about products. These groups enable them to engage with each other, and with brands and products they love, in a meaningful way, and brands have a great opportunity to build these communities and deepen their relationships with their customers through them.</p>
      <p>However, <i>where</i> Gen Zers engage online is different than other generations. More and more, Gen Z conversations are happening through dark one-to-one social channels, such as email, text, instant messaging, and even Fortnite and Twitch.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Greg Petro: How can retailers and brands change their social media strategy to effectively engage with consumers?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Amber Atherton:</b> Brands need to focus on fostering these communities of people who love their products. First, they need to identify their existing customers who are already telling their brand story online and partner with the right ones. These brand “superfans” are creating user-generated content and then sharing it with others in their niche communities across Instagram, Facebook, video game platforms and on dark social channels.</p>
      <p>Brands need to find those superfans, and then make sure they understand who those individuals’ followers are and what demographics they represent. Engagement, follower-to-following ratio, geotags, aesthetics and hashtags are some of the metrics brands should look at to ensure they’re reaching out to the right potential partners. Then, they should invite those fans to have some kind of official relationship with the brand.</p>
      <p>But they shouldn’t offer financial rewards. Membership within most niche groups is not transactional, but built around a common interest or pastime, like a sport or hobby. Brands that get creative with rewards for their content-generating partners stand a better chance of deepening their relationships with them.</p>
      <p>Brands should also be hands-off when it comes to trying to control their superfans’ creative content. Companies can make suggestions, but they shouldn’t try to steer their fans toward creating posts that aren’t original and true to those individuals’ unique voices.</p>
      <p>And, finally, brands should plan to be in it for the long haul. A brand community’s value compounds over time, so companies need to think long term when partnering with their authentic advocates to drive engagement.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Greg Petro: Which retailers and brands are doing it right?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Amber Atherton:</b> Savvy brands are paying attention to how consumer perceptions of influencers are changing, and they’re looking to engage with their customers in authentic ways that inspire deeper trust. The really smart brands are also looking to their existing fans for feedback and ideas that drive new product development and sales. Peloton and Cheetos are two brands that are using particularly unique, creative and fun ways to build communities that drive engagement and long-term loyalty.</p>
      <p>Peloton’s community now includes more than 1 million members, who not only interact with their peers on a screen as they work out, but also through the brand’s social media channels—where they can segment themselves into even more niche communities based on their interests, occupations or other hobbies. The brand leverages its community members’ individual fitness stories to drive deeper engagement in an authentic way, creating original content highlighting peoples’ achievements. Peloton also encourages community members to engage closely with their fitness instructors, many of whom create and share their own original content across social media in order to inspire their students. These kinds of community-building efforts strengthen the brand’s connection with its fans in a very personal way that encourages long-term loyalty.</p>
      <p>Cheetos is another brand that’s getting it right by leveraging its fans’ content on Instagram and through other platforms. Interestingly, Cheetos has really tapped into the beauty community—which wouldn’t seem like the most logical fit for the brand—by encouraging bloggers and makeup artists to post Cheetos-inspired nail, makeup and hair looks on Instagram. The brand also collaborated with fans during New York Fashion Week in September to share and elevate their Cheetos-inspired outfits. The brand even curates fans’ photos of meals they’ve made that creatively incorporate Cheetos, adding its own caption and tagging the person on Instagram. These are all great, creative and fun ways to build the Cheetos brand community.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The evolution in the influencers space underscores the importance of deep customer understanding. As so many brands and retailers profess their commitment to placing the customer at the center of all they do, they need make good on this promise by listening to the voice of the customer to inform the end-to-end customer experience, from communications to the actual product to the purchase and ownership experience. Gen Zers in particular place huge emphasis and value on authenticity. We will watch this space with interest to see whether and how brands and their influencers can adapt and pass the new consumers’ authenticity sniff test.</p>
