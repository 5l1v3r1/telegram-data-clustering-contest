      <p>The Volta River Authority (VRA) in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a comprehensive action plan to mitigate the impact of climate change on its operations.<br/><br/>The initiative christened “Corporate Climate-Smart Actions” included VRA renewable energy development programme, community development projects, waste management and reporting on carbon footprint.<br/><br/>Dr Daniel Benefor, Senior Programmes Officer in charge of Climate Change, EPA, announced this in Accra to mark this year's Safety Week.<br/><br/>The event was on the theme," Ensuring Environmental Sustainability: a Key Requirements of Our Braise Strategy".<br/><br/>He said, “these actions were necessary because of the devastating effects of climate change on water resources, energy suppliers, crop production and food security”.<br/><br/>Touching on the renewable energy programme, Dr Obenefor said VRA intended to install a 2.5 megawatts Navrongo solar power plant and 17 megawatts Upper West regional solar powerpoint.<br/><br/>On community projects, he said the Authority had set out a framework for guiding the process of support for the development of all communities impacted by the operations of VRA.<br/><br/>Focusing on solid waste management, VRA had established the Akosombo PET bottles processing centre in collaboration with COLIBA Recycling Services Limited.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Volta basin, prolonged dry seasons had replaced shorter dry spells and the number of ‘hot days’ and ‘hot nights’ had increased significantly in all seasons due to climate change.<br/><br/>Also in the last century, human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation have caused a jump in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in extra trapped heat and higher global temperatures.<br/><br/>In 2016, Ghana emitted 42 million tonnes of greenhouses gases and would rise to 74 million tonnes by 2030.<br/><br/>The energy sector accounts for 36 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions, while electricity generation contributes 12 per cent of the emissions.<br/><br/>Mr Benefor urged staff of VRA to participate fully in the overall actions and adhere to the solid waste segregation programme to ensure environmental sustainability.<br/><br/>He encouraged them to set an example by switching off the air conditioners, lights or the computers and practice energy-efficient appliances to reduce the impact of climate change.<br/><br/>Mr Emmanuel Antwi-Darkwa, Chief Executive Officer, VRA, said the Authority had adhered to strict safety measures as aligned to global standards to ensure worker’s safety.<br/><br/>He said VRA was committed to operationalizing excellence as far as environmental sustainability was concerned and would continue to create the needed working environment to build confidence and increase productivity.<br/><br/>“Our Corporate Social Responsibility is geared towards environmental sustainability and we have instituted programmes on sanitation and ecological issues to mitigate the impact on the environment on which we operate,” he added.<br/>He said the Authority’s environmental performance had improved because of the proactive measures put in place, urging all to be environmentally vigilance to protect the earth from further destruction.
