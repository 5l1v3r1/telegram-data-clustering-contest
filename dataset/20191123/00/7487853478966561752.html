      <h1>Harry Kane Has Showed He's the Perfect Striker to Lead José Mourinho's Revival</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.90min.com/users/15213509" target="_blank">Max Cooper</a></address>
      <p>​It's good having him back, isn't it? </p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's sudden sacking caused ripples in Europe, but Tottenham Hotspur's subsequent appointment of José Mourinho sent veritable shockwaves throughout the footballing world. </p>
      <p>Spurs fans had not recovered from their beloved manager's dismissal when news broke that Daniel Levy had hired one of the most controversial, but successful coaches in history. </p>
      <p>Mourinho's arrival split opinion within the Lilywhites' fanbase, as the ex-Chelsea hero had promised to never cross the divide from west to north London, and his most recent venture in Manchester ended painfully for both parties. </p>
      <p>Not to mention, Mourinho is Mourinho. He splits opinion just about everywhere he goes and anywhere he doesn't. </p>

      <p>The Portuguese mastermind's stock has fallen significantly in recent years, and his time at Spurs may be his final roll of the dice in the <a href="https://www.90min.com/leagues/premier-league">​Premier League</a>, as he attempts to salvage his diminishing reputation.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's eventual Old Trafford departure stemmed from a disconnect between players and staff, and the coach was accused of not understanding the mentality and needs of the modern-day footballer. </p>
      <p>This fractured relationship was epitomised in his handling of star midfielder <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/paul-pogba">​Paul Pogba</a>, who he stripped of captaincy and publicly criticised for his lack of commitment to the cause. </p>
      <p>His lack of empathy for the new generation was the beginning of the end of his time in Manchester, and even older heads such as Nemanja Matic failed to bridge the ever-widening gap, which eventually caused the definitive split.</p>
      <p>But there will always be players who respond to Mourinho's methods. </p>
      <p>When we try to pinpoint a 'Mourinho type', we have to cast our minds back to his first spell at <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/chelsea">​Chelsea</a>, when he assembled a group of men who were willing to run through brick walls for a boss willing to hide in washing baskets for his followers. </p>

      <p>Strong personalities such as Didier Drogba, John Terry, Michael Essien, current Blues coach Frank Lampard and latterly <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/diego-costa">​Diego Costa</a> spring to mind as Mourinho's trusted disciples, all men who responded with defiance when their leader threw down the gauntlet. </p>
      <p>The lack of these figures was cost Mourinho at Man Utd, but he may not need to look far for his battle-hardened warrior in North London. In <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/harry-kane">​Harry Kane</a>, the Portuguese taskmaster possesses one of the most old-fashioned and professional footballers in the game, and he must inspire the Spurs captain to transcend his message to the rest of his squad. </p>
      <p>Kane is the epitome of a 'Mourinho type': down to earth, hard-working, loyal and an elite footballer. </p>
      <p>The talismanic striker has had to graft his way to the top of the Premier League scoring charts, putting in the hard yards in the lower leagues with Leyton Orient, Millwall, <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/norwich">​Norwich</a> and <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leicester">​Leicester City</a>. </p>
      <p>Kane boasts bags of natural talent, but it's his grit and desire to always improve which sets him apart from the rest of the top-tier forwards. The home-grown forward's heart, commitment and genuine love for the club are traits that Mourinho must tap into, and if he is able to win over 'one of their own', then the rest of the Spurs troops may also fall in line. </p>
      <p>But we shouldn't brush over what Kane can bring to Mourinho's side on the field, too. </p>

      <p>The Spurs number ten has all the bullish attributes that his new manager craves - and then some. Mourinho's robust style requires a strong forward who can hold up the ball, relieve the pressure on the typically resolute defence and then dominate proceedings in both boxes from set-pieces. </p>
      <p>Kane can do all of the above, and his winning goal over <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/west-ham">​West Ham</a> on Saturday afternoon typified the role that a 'Mourinho type' must perform. The 26-year-old met a curling cross from wide, and with a vicious, towering and commanding header, he put the game beyond their London rivals, handing the new boss his first win in the Tottenham dugout. </p>
      <p>A sign of things to come, perhaps. </p>
      <p>It wasn't all plain sailing for the visitors however, who had to dig in to secure their 3-2 win on Saturday afternoon. The Hammers grew in confidence during the final 15 minutes, and - very uncharacteristically for a Mourinho side - Spurs conceded two late goals to set up a nervy finale. </p>
      <p>When called upon however, Kane did the dirty work which Mourinho demands. The strapping striker held possession, delayed releasing the ball and forced his marker to concede a needless free kick time after time, running down the clock at key moments throughout the match. </p>

      <p>Basically, he is the master of winning niggly fouls to give his teammates a much-needed breather - straight from the José playbook. </p>
      <p>Kane was one of a handful of Spurs players who put in their best performance for a considerable amount of time in the Lilywhite shirt, and Mourinho will need his star striker to lead from the front as the focal point and heartbeat of this refreshed group. </p>
      <p>The road is long until we see the true nature of this new era in north London, and the problems within the club have not been expelled with the sacking of Pochettino. But Spurs certainly did not lack in entertainment value, and if Mourinho can keep Kane onside, then we may finally see the rebirth of José's golden years.</p>
