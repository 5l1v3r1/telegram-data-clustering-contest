      <h1>How To Successfully Navigate Global Expansion</h1>

      <p>Successful entrepreneurs don’t always start out with a rock-solid business model (or even a polished product). They must, however, identify a market that’s large enough to allow for sustained growth. After all, investors ultimately want to see a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobdeutsch/2018/12/12/rethinking-thinking-about-the-meaning-of-roi/">return on their investment</a>. Just remember that no matter how great your product or service is, VCs will pass on you if the potential market for your offering is limited.</p>
      <p>Maybe your goal isn’t to be a venture-backed company — not every entrepreneur needs to raise capital to get where she wants to go. Even so, you’ll need sustained demand if you hope to be profitable. </p>

      <h3>Brave New World</h3>
      <p>If you’re based in the U.S., there’s a good chance that you’ll find some customers, no matter what you’re selling. But there are also emerging and developed markets all over the globe, and tapping into them can prove beneficial for a number of reasons. </p>
      <p>Going global makes sense when you’re looking to balance a fluctuating sales cycle that’s based on seasonal demand. It could also give you the opportunity to make your supply chain more efficient or to capitalize on new technologies or international corporate expertise. </p>
      <p>International expansion is far from a risk-free endeavor, though. Language and cultural barriers, varying legal standards, and perhaps wildly different customer expectations are just a few of the obstacles you’ll likely have to navigate if you head overseas. Think carefully about your reasons for expanding, and only make the move if it supports your long-term objectives.</p>
      <p>If you do decide to proceed, here are a few things to keep in mind: </p>
      <h4>1. Prioritize local customers. </h4>
      <p>As you expand your operations to a new location, all of your teams — from marketing to product development — should be focused on addressing your new local market. IKEA, the do-it-yourself home furnishing retailer, provides a great example of how brands should approach international expansion. When the company <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/warrenshoulberg/2018/07/30/put-another-stamp-on-the-ikea-passport/#139d0d9b3f7c">opened up shop in India</a>, it had to account for the fact that the South Asian country didn’t have the same DIY tradition that exists in Europe and the U.S. As a result, IKEA’s Indian outlets will offer on-site assembly services — a necessary departure from its strategy for North American stores. </p>
      <p>Like IKEA, you’ll need to make sure you have a deep understanding of the culture you’ll be integrating into and be prepared to make strategic changes to address cultural differences across countries — and even within them. “Just as you expect differences in residents of California, the Midwest, and New York, you need to understand the nuances between Vancouver and Calgary [for example],” <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/8211-expand-business-internationally.html">explains</a> Josh Robinson, vice president of franchising and development for Pearle Vision, an optical brand. “You also might need a local person’s perspective to understand how the culture and even taste could affect the market for some consumer goods and services outside the U.S.” </p>
      <h4>2. Keep legal issues in mind.</h4>
      <p>Your product may be patented in the U.S., but that economic moat disappears once you leave the States. When Gaston Frydlewski founded elastic shoelace company Hickies in New York in 2011, he quickly identified a global audience for his product — <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/195022281-hickies-scaling-global">and the need to protect his design</a>. He couldn’t afford a full-time intellectual property lawyer at the time, so he spent several hours on the phone with the United States Trademark and Patent Office, read legal books, and reviewed patents to write his own. It was a long process, but it paid off. Today, Hickies has secured more than 70 patents worldwide, which prevents competitors from poaching its design and underselling the company.   </p>
      <p>This DIY approach worked for Frydlewski, but it isn’t the only option. Provided your company can afford it, hiring a lawyer with international market expertise can help you navigate new territory. If your business can’t swing the costs of an in-house legal expert, <a href="https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/reasons-for-outsourcing-legal-services-43262">you can outsource to get the legal services</a> you need when you actually need them.</p>
      <p>There are other legal issues you should keep in mind in addition to protecting your idea. For example, your HR team may need legal advice if you plan to hire local workers in your new markets. Bottom line: Don’t go abroad without keeping legal concerns in view at every stage.</p>
      <h4>3. Recognize that roles must evolve.</h4>
      <p>As your company scales across the globe, existing roles and functions will have to evolve to keep up with that growth. For example, finance departments in global organizations must be equipped to take on a more strategic role. “By shifting their focus from managing the details of financial operations and supplier payment processing to delivering more strategic advice to the business, they can better support [your] organization’s growth ambitions,” <a href="http://elitebusinessmagazine.co.uk/global/item/what-s-holding-you-back-from-going-global">says</a> Chen Amit, CEO of Tipalti, a global payables automation platform provider.</p>
      <p>As you expand globally, you’ll likely be hiring new team members and perhaps even starting entirely new international divisions. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to scaling a team. But the path to success lies in planning your team’s growth <i>before</i> you start adding new roles and updating job descriptions. Should you increase the capacity of an established department or build an entirely new one? Are you in need of someone with niche expertise to fill a skills gap in your organization? Update your current job descriptions and create new roles accordingly.</p>
      <p>As the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2019/07/16/three-things-every-startup-should-consider-when-expanding-internationally/">leader of an international business</a>, your focus will be pulled in many different directions. Surround yourself with experts, and empower them to help you. Ultimately, your ability to adapt will be the reason you succeed.</p>
