      <p>Justice Minister Andrew Little has announced prisoners serving less than three years in jail will have their voting rights restored.</p>
      <p>Mr Little said the government plans to make the change to the Electoral Amendment Bill before the 2020 general election.</p>
      <p>The law change will affect 1900 prisoners and means the law will return to how it was before a National-led government removed voting rights from all prisoners in 2010.</p>

      <p>A Waitangi Tribunal report found that law change disproportionally impacted MƒÅori prisoners and a High Court declaration stated the current law is inconsistent with the right to vote in the Bill of Rights Act.</p>
      <p>Mr Little said the three-year jail sentence threshold means prisoners will be able to vote on the government that will be in power when they are released.</p>
      <p>"It is right that someone who is going to be released back into the community during a Parliamentary term should have the right to have a say on who leads them during their time of freedom," Mr Little said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mr Little said the law change will also address concerns that prisoners are not re-enrolling to vote once they leave prison.</p>
      <p>"The Waitangi Tribunal noted this means the law is effectively acting as a permanent ban on voting for prisoners. To address this, the law will also be changed so that longer-term prisoners will be enrolled on release.</p>
      <p>"This will ensure people sentenced to three years or more in prison can re-engage with the democratic process as easily as possible."</p>
