      <p>More than 70 drivers had too much to drink when they got behind the wheel during Christchurch’s annual Cup and Show week.</p>
      <p>About 1800 drivers went through checkpoints set up by police to target drink drivers across the city last week, acting road policing manager Senior Sergeant Vaughn Lapslie said.</p>
      <p>A team of eight officers from Christchurch’s impairment prevention team and about six officers who travelled from the Nelson and Tasman region carried out the operation.</p>
      <p>Senior Sergeant Lapslie said about 35 drivers were over the 400mcg limit which requires them to attend a court date and about 36 were over the 250mcg limit, receiving an instant fine and demerit points.</p>
      <p>“That is 71 drivers on our roads that were too drunk to drive. One is probably too many.</p>
      <p>“It is a big week for Christchurch and it is disappointing that people did not make other plans and arrangements. It’s not like the week snuck up on us, there is the opportunity to make better plans,” he said.</p>
