      <h1>Sandra Smith challenges Dem lawmaker's claim impeachment hearings showed 'incredibly convincing testimony'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T00:54:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 00:54</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>On Friday's edition of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/the-story">"The Story,"</a> Sandra Smith challenged a Democrat lawmaker's claim that this week's public hearings in the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump impeachment inquiry</a> showcased "incredibly convincing testimony of bribery"</p>
      <p>Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, responded affirmatively when Smith asked if she had heard concrete evidence of impeachable offenses on Trump's behalf.</p>
      <p>"These are people of extraordinary credibility," said Dean, who singled out testimony by former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and ex-National Security Council staffer Fiona Hill. "We heard from most of these folks incredibly convincing, credible testimony of bribery by a president -- of a president who had a 'shadow' foreign policy."</p>

      <p>However, Smith replied that lawmakers who were in the hearing pointed out there was no discussion explicitly of "bribery."</p>
      <p>"Even a moderate Republican like Congressman [Will] Hurd [R-Texas] ... has hinted that he would be a 'no' on impeachment," said Smith, noting Hurd is retiring after this term and does not have anything to "prove" to Trump.</p>
      <p>"What exactly was it that you heard ... that you are basing impeaching the president [on]?" she asked.</p>
      <p>Dean, whose committee would be tasked with drafting articles of impeachment against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">Trump</a>, said she rejected claims by critics the remarks presented by witnesses amounted to hearsay.</p>

      <p>"[H]earsay evidence is credible, but we don't need just hearsay," she said. "We had first-hand folks who were in on the phone call, and you had the testimony -- Dr. Hill's testimony was without any kind of scrutiny."</p>
      <p>"Where I stand is for our Constitution and for our democracy," she later added.</p>
      <p>When asked if she is prepared to vote to impeach Trump should articles be put before the full House of Representatives, Dean demurred.</p>
      <p>"Why would anybody prejudge a vote when you don't even have the articles in front of you?" Dean said, calling impeachment an "extraordinary remedy" and a "last resort."</p>

      <p>Dean also said that Trump's insistence that he wants a Senate trial if impeached was "puzzling."</p>
      <p>"He looks forward to a trial, he wants to bring forward witnesses, which is absolutely puzzling to me -- I sit on Judiciary," she said. "He had the opportunity to bring forward witnesses, he had the opportunity to bring forward any kind of exculpatory information and witnesses -- and in fact, he blocked subpoenas -- lawful subpoenas -- so he's obstructed Congress from doing such oversight."</p>
