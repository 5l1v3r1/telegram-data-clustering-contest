      <p>Good news for Queenslanders this morning, that the State of Fire Emergency Declaration has been revoked fully across the state.</p>
      <p>It was scaled back considerably earlier this week, with 36 of the 42 local government areas on November 20.</p>
      <p>Though today, the declaration has been lifted from the remaining six areas, thanks to easing conditions.</p>
      <p>However, we’re being warned that a number of <b><a href="https://www.ruralfire.qld.gov.au/BushFire_Safety/Neighbourhood-Safer-Places/lgas/List%20Documents/2019-11-22-FireBanSER.pdf">local fire bans</a></b> remain in place, including here on the Gold Coast.</p>
      <p>Acting Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (QFES) Commissioner Mike Wassing says now’s not the time to be complacent.</p>
      <p>“Over the last few weeks our state has been in the grips of some very severe and challenging fire weather and while the threat has eased, it has not passed.</p>
      <p>“Although the State of Fire Emergency Declaration has been revoked, QFES has made the decision to impose local fire bans across large parts of the state.</p>
      <p>“This decision is not made lightly but it is vital we continue to work together and do everything we can to protect Queensland communities during this ongoing bushfire season.</p>
      <p>“Under a local fire ban all open fires are prohibited and all Permits to Light Fire previously issued are cancelled.</p>
      <p>“Residents should make themselves aware of what restrictions are in place for their area by speaking with their local fire wardens and visiting the Rural Fire Service website,” Mr Wassing said.</p>
      <p>Mr Wassing has also thanked the Queensland community for their support during these tough few months.</p>
      <p>“While conditions have eased slightly, and the bushfire danger has fallen as a result, we still have significant blazes that continue to burn.</p>
      <p>“I want to thank the community for heeding the conditions in the Declaration and urge everyone to continue to abide by local fire bans.</p>
      <p>“Now is not the time to be complacent – conditions are still dry and there isn’t significant rainfall expected in Queensland in the immediate future,” Mr Wassing said.</p>
