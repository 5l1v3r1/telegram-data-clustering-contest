      <h1>This Week In XR: Ubiquity 6 Makes The Smartphone Spatial, Why IAPPA Is A VR Showcase, Magic Leap’s New Games</h1>

      <p>We just spent two long days of checking out 70 VR attractions offered for sale at the world’s largest amusement park conference and expo, IAAPA, which is best described as a milea of moon bounces, punctuated by cotton candy machines. The most original location based VR (LBVR) we saw at IAAPA was Barron Games’ VR Foosball Table, with runner up going to underwater VR, which will soon monetize a swimming pool near you. Otherwise, the best LBVR at IAPPA this year was the best VR last year: Hologate, VR Studios, and VRsenal, none of whom put you on a motion platform and blow wind in your face. We’ll drop all the details in the next couple of day but, in the meantime, here a look at VR Foosball.</p>
      <p>We’re excited that our demand for more AAA titles from Magic Leap One was immediately fulfilled by two top shelf titles from Weta Workshop and Resolution Games, who have already delivered the best two spatial titles for the Magic Leap One, <i>Dr. Grodbort’s Invaders</i> and <i>Angry Birds</i>, respectively.</p>
      <p><b>Weta Workshop launches new Dr. Grordbort’s game for Magic Leap One. </b>Dr. Grordbort’s Boosters is all about controlling a rocket with your hands. The experience was built from a game jam the group held at the Weta studio in Wellington, New Zealand to explore the Magic Leap One SDK. Learn more about the game on <a href="https://www.magicleap.com/news/partner-stories/weta-launches-rocket-game-on-magic-leap-world">Magic Leap’s blog here</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Creators of first Magic Leap game announce new detective game on the way. </b>The game, <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/glimt">Glimt</a>, is stated as “coming soon” and will build on all the lessons Resolution Games learned from their previous Magic Leap One and VR titles: Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs, Bait! and Acron: Attack of the Squirrels! \</p>
      <p><a href="https://ubiquity6.com/"><b>Ubiquity6</b></a><b> launches Display.land for scanning and sharing augmented realities.</b> The company’s new app uses the smartphone’s camera and graphics processing power to scan a recreate real world spaces. The photogrammetry and its location is synced to the cloud allowing different user’s scans to be stitched together. In other words, with the Display.land app, Ubiquity 6 is building a network of 3D places. Users can also add augmentations such as annotations, artwork, or games to their scans. The app is available on iOS and Android at <a href="https://display.land/">Display.land</a>.</p>

      <p><b>Vader Immortal Final Episode 3 released this week. </b>If ILMxLab’s first person VR triology isn’t the best VR content every created for a home system, it’s damn close.

      <p><b>Oculus Link beta begins. </b>Owners of the Oculus Quest can now connect their headsets to a PC via an Oculus approved USB-C cable that will effectively turn their standalone headset into a PCVR headset. In theory, this means any PCVR title playable on a Rift-S will now be playable on the Oculus Quest when linked to a VR ready PC. Learn more about what cables will work on the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/play-rift-content-on-quest-with-oculus-link-available-now-in-beta/">Oculus blog post here</a>.</p>
