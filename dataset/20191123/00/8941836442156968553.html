      <p>WATFORD, England (AP) - Watford returned to the bottom of the Premier League after losing 3-0 at home to Burnley on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Chris Wood’s snap finish, Ashley Barnes’ penalty and James Tarkowski’s late strike condemned Watford to a club-record 11th straight home league match without a win.</p>
      <p>Burnley moved into sixth place.</p>
      <p>Barnes’ penalty was awarded after a VAR check, with Jose Holebas adjudged to have brought the 30-year-old striker down in the area.</p>
