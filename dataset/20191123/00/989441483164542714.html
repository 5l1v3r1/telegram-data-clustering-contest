      <p>Part I</p>
      <p>Merera Gudina has been involved in Ethiopian Politics for nearly fifty years now.</p>
      <p>As a young man, he was a member of All Ethiopian Socialist Movement (Meison in Amharic) and was imprisoned for seven years.</p>
      <p>In the post Colonel Mengistu Hailemariam era, Merara immersed himself in ethnic based politics and has emerged as a leader in that political tradition.</p>
      <p>He is the chairman of Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC). Some known him as a wise politician with unwavering stand for the cause of Ethiopia even while leading an ethnic based political movement.</p>
      <p>For others, Merera has become a perplexing political figure to say the least. From the interviews he had at different times, it has become clear that he is more into ethnic politics.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Nahoo TV, he is clearer as to where he stands in Ethiopian politics. The way forward, for him, is to democratize existing ethnic federalism.</p>
      <p>He even went to the extent of saying that Addis Ababa should not he in a collision course with Oromo region. In essence, what he said is that Addis Ababa is at the mercy of Oromo region.</p>
