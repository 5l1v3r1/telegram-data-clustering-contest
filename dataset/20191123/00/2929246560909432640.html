      <p>Mushfiqur Rahim's 70-ball stay helped Bangladesh push the game into the third day, but with them trailing by 89 runs still, another innings defeat doesn't look far away.</p>

      <p>Resuming at an overnight score of 174/3, Virat Kohli, along with his deputy Ajinkya Rahane, extended the home team's first innings lead into three figures, before the latter was dismissed to the left arm-spin of Taijul Islam, immediately after completing a stroke-filled fifty.</p>
      <p>The skipper meanwhile marched his way onwards to his 27th Test century, and in doing so went past Ricky Ponting's tally of 19 Test hundreds as captain leaving him trailing only Graeme Smith who leads the count with 25. He celebrated the milestone two overs later, hitting four boundaries off Abu Jayed - each towards a different part of the ground to showcase his range, and India eventually headed for lunch in a strong position of 289/4.</p>

      <p>The post-lunch session was perhaps the only phase of the game where the visitors managed to show some spark, as they managed to bag five wickets in a span of 11.1 overs before India declared at 347/9. Jadeja (12) misjudged the line and movement and shouldered arms to an incoming delivery from Abu Jayed that hit the top of off, while Kohli middled one off Ebadat Hossain straight to Taijul Islam at long leg.</p>
      <p>Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma fell in a space of ten balls, while Wriddhiman Saha remained unbeaten on 17. Ebadat and Al-Amin Hossain bagged three wickets each for the visitors.</p>

      <p>Ishant then returned to cast a repeat of the first innings, removing opener Shadman Islam and skipper Mominul Islam, both for ducks in his first two overs. Bangladesh stood at 7/2 at tea, and slipped further to a precarious 13/4. Mahmudullah joined Mushfiqur Rahim, and the two experienced men showed some grit and intent in the same brief, adding 69 runs in 11.5 overs, before the former limped off the field having pulled a hamstring.</p>
      <p>Mushfiqur though continued his merry ways against India and registered his second fifty of the series. Ashwin was deprived of his first wicket of the Test, courtesy a dropped chance off Mehidy Hasan by Ajinkya Rahane in the first slip. It didn't cost India much, as Kohli pouched one in the same position off Ishant two overs later, to give the pacer his fourth scalp.</p>
      <p>Umesh returned for his final spell of the day and struck with his third ball, inducing an edge off Taijul which Rahane clung on to. That marked the end of second day's play at the Eden Gardens with Bangladesh stood at 152/6, with Rahim unbeaten on 59.</p>
