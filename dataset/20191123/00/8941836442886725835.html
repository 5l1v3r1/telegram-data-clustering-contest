      <p>BERLIN (AP) - German authorities have again deported a Lebanese man who was convicted of drug dealing and deported earlier this year but then returned to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/germany/">Germany</a>.</p>
      <p>The German news agency dpa reported that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibrahim-miri/">Ibrahim Miri</a> was handed over to Lebanese authorities on Saturday in Beirut.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibrahim-miri/">Miri</a> was earlier deported to Lebanon in July and was banned from re-entering Europe’s visa-free Schengen travel area, which includes <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/germany/">Germany</a>. However, he somehow reappeared in the German city of Bremen last month, applied for asylum and was arrested. After his asylum application was rejected, he tried to appeal but a Bremen administrative court on Friday rejected <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibrahim-miri/">Miri</a>’s appeal.</p>

        <p>His case has made headlines in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/germany/">Germany</a>, with some alleging that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/ibrahim-miri/">Miri</a>’s ability to return to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/germany/">Germany</a> showed the country’s allegedly lax handling of asylum requests by criminals.</p>
