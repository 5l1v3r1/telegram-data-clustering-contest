      <p>The perception that the Heath House supportive housing project is bad for its neighbourhood hasn’t scared away at least one developer.</p>
      <p>Applications to rezone and develop land at 320 Mills Road were submitted to the City of Kelowna yesterday, Nov. 20 in the hopes of building a three storey, 18-unit rental housing project roughly 250 metres away from Heath House.</p>
      <p>In the past, there have been numerous complaints about crime and drug dealing in that neighbourhood since the housing for the homeless was opened last winter.</p>
      <p>No name is attached to the new applications, which were submitted by an architectural design firm.</p>
      <p>“It is the developer’s intent to maintain the building as a rental property, with a focus on student tenants,” a letter from the architect states, noting it’s only a six-minute walk to catch a bus to UBCO.</p>
      <p>Along with the zoning application, there are requests for variances in parking, bike storage, height and open space requirements.</p>
