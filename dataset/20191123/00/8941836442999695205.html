      <p>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) - Norwich climbed off the bottom of the English Premier League by beating Everton 2-0 for its first away win of the season, piling the pressure back on home manager Marco Silva on Saturday.</p>
      <p>After a goalless 10 hours and 20 minutes on the road, Norwich scored through Todd Cantwell - his first goal since the team’s last league success, at home to Manchester City in September - and added an injury-time effort from Dennis Srbeny.</p>
      <p>The win lifted Daniel Farke’s side to within a point of escaping the bottom three and left Everton just four points above the relegation zone, after a sixth defeat in nine league games.</p>
      <p>Silva is looking over his shoulder as seven of Everton’s next nine matches are against tough opponents - second-placed Leicester (twice), Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City.</p>
