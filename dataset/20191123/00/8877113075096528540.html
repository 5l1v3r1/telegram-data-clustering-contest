      <p>Authorities say a hot tub display at an East Texas state fair in September is the likely source of contamination which led to a Legionnaires' disease outbreak that's killed one person and sickened seven others.</p>
      <p>Officials in Tyler have closed the convention center where the state fair took place.</p>
      <p>The Tyler Morning Telegraph reports officials plan to remediate the convention center's plumbing system.</p>
      <p>This is the second outbreak linked to a state fair in the U.S. this year. Officials in North Carolina say four people have died and nearly 100 were hospitalized after contamination also linked to a hot tub display at a September state fair.</p>
