      <p>“I’m feeling good. Everything is going well here. I’m delighted with how things are going for me,” he told footballmadeinghana.com.</p>
      <p>”I’m working hard to return to the national team. I know the competition there isn’t easy. But I think I’m in the best of shape currently.</p>
      <p>“It’s the decision of the coach so I don’t want to say anything about it. I want to come back to the national team as we work hard to bring back the love.”</p>
