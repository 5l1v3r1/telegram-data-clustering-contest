      <p>Overseas news publications are naming the man convicted of Grace Millane's murder, despite his name still being suppressed.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old man was found guilty of killing the 21-year-old backpacker last night, in a unanimous decision by the jury.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/grace-was-our-sunshine-and-she-will-be-missed-forever">
            <b>Grace 'will be missed forever'</b>
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>He cannot yet be named for legal reasons, which have been strictly adhered to by New Zealand media, who can be prosecuted if they don't comply with the court's order.</p>
      <p>However, for at least the second time, major overseas publications are flouting the suppression, using the man's name in their stories.</p>
      <p>Despite repeated warnings after the man's first appearance in December last year, dozens of publications repeatedly breached the suppression order.</p>
      <p>In July, Google suspended its trending emails in New Zealand and apologised to Justice Minister Andrew Little after a mass email went to 10,000 subscribers naming the killer.</p>
      <p>Following that, Little began work with the UK, Australia and Canada to see what more could be done to ensure suppression orders were obeyed.</p>
      <p>At that time, there were fears in the legal community the continuous publication of the 27-year-old's name and details would compromise the trial.</p>
      <p>Concerns were also raised by New Zealand Bar Association vice-president Jonathan Eaton QC, who said the breaches were not only endangering a fair trial but potentially any future trial.</p>
      <p>"The publicity about the accused undermines the prospect of finding an impartial jury," he said.</p>
      <p>It is possible for sites to geographically block those outside certain areas from accessing their content, but previously that has largely failed - given some search sites still list headlines in searches.</p>
      <p>Grace Millane was strangled to death on the eve of her 22nd birthday by her Tinder date in his downtown Auckland apartment on December 1 last year.</p>
      <p>He then went about trying to cover it up and dumped her body in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges.</p>
      <p>The Crown argued it was murder, the defence said it was an accident.</p>
      <p>After hearing from 39 witnesses over three weeks, the jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict last night.</p>
      <p>The killer will return to court on February 21 at 9am to be sentenced.</p>
