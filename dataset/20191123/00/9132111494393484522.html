      <p>Member of Parliament for Ahafo Ano South East Constituency, Francis Manu-Adabor, has called on government to declare the country as a land title zone to generate more revenue.</p>
      <p>According to him, the expansion of land titles should not be limited to the Greater Accra region and Ashanti region but to other regions to increase revenue as most Ghanaians are ready to register their lands.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the floor of parliament on Friday, November 22, the MP said, ‘The lands commission in Accra, Kumasi and Tema where we have the land title going on. It is time for us to expand this land title to cover the whole country because Mr Speaker, once these three towns are doing land title, the other parts of the country should too. And when the land title gets to where we are working these, the people will have to bring their documents back and start with the land title process. If we get all these maps it will be easier for us to extend the land title services to all the regions in the country.”</p>
      <p>“We get a lot of revenue from these three cities because of land title and ones we want to get more revenue. I think it’s time for us to declare the country as a land title zone so that people will register their land for the revenue to increase.”</p>
      <p>He also added that government could prevent Ghanaians from dodging tax payment as most of the buildings are not mapped.</p>
      <p>He added that this could be avoided if every building is captured on the map so that tax network will be expanded for more revenue generation.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Speaker there are so many people in the country whose building are not mapped so they dodge all taxes in the country, if we produce maps covering the country, every small area with a building hiding anywhere will be captured on the map so the tax network will be expanded and all these people will be brought to the tax new so we can get more revenue for the country.” He said</p>
