      <p>AURORA, Colo. (AP) - Prosecutors will not file charges against police who were involved in a fatal confrontation with a man in suburban Denver.</p>
      <p>District Attorney Dave Young says he could not find indisputable evidence that Aurora officers or others used “unjustified” force when confronting 23-year-old Elijah McClain on Aug. 24.</p>
      <p>Sentinel Colorado reports police received a call about a person wearing a ski mask and waving his arms as he walked down a street. Officers say McClain refused to stop and fought back when they tried to take him into custody.</p>
      <p>He suffered cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital and was declared brain dead. A forensic pathologist working for the Adams County coroner’s office could not determine exactly what led to McClain’s death.</p>
