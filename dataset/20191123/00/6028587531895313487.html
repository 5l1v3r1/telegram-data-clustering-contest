      <p>Isaiah Wynn’s NFL odometer includes 82 downs.His next are expected to arrive Sunday as the New England Patriots host the Dallas Cowboys for a 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.</p>
      <p>“Really good player. Everybody liked him coming out of school,” Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett said of the Georgia product during his <a href="https://www.patriots.com/audio/cowboys-hc-jason-garrett-11-20-they-ve-been-incredible-at-taking-the-ball-away">midweek conference call</a> with the New England media. “They took him in the first round for a reason, because he’s a talented guy, and you can see that when you watch his tape both at the college level and then when you see the snaps he’s played in the NFL.”</p>
      <p>The snaps have been fleeting for Wynn. The 23-year-old left tackle, drafted No. 23 overall by New England an April ago, suffered a torn Achilles on his ninth preseason snap as a rookie after arriving with a repaired torn labrum. He’d <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/08/17/patriots-left-tackle-isaiah-wynns-preseason-start-said-all-it-needed-to/">return</a> to start New England’s initial two games this fall, allowing a single quarterback hit, only to exit against the Miami Dolphins a dozen snaps in.</p>
      <p>The Patriots then placed Wynn on injured reserve <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/09/17/with-isaiah-wynn-on-injured-reserve-patriots-wait-out-the-unknown-at-left-tackle/#751539ec67e1">due to turf toe</a> on Sept. 17. The former first-team All-SEC selection and Senior Bowl standout resumed practicing after six weeks.</p>
      <p>Wynn then resumed his place on the 53-man roster after eight weeks, having been activated by New England on Tuesday as undrafted wideout Gunner Olszewski out of Bemidji State went to IR.</p>
      <p>Wynn has not been listed on the injury report since then. He’s practiced in full.</p>
      <p>“Right now, what we’re seeing is a guy that’s really completely healthy, that’s stronger than he’s been, that we thought was a good player when we went into the season,” Patriots offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia <a href="https://www.patriots.com/audio/dante-scarnecchia-11-22-i-have-to-do-better">told reporters</a> on Friday. “We think that much more of him now, and we think we got a guy that’s completely healthy. None of us can predict the future, but we all want the best for this kid. He’s really a good guy.”</p>
      <p>In Wynn’s absence, the well-traveled Marshall Newhouse <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/09/11/marshall-newhouse-provides-patriots-with-starting-insurance-at-tackle/#4be1241053ce">started</a> eight games for the Patriots at left tackle. Newhouse had originally signed as former Texas Christian teammate Marcus Cannon worked back from a shoulder injury at right tackle.</p>
      <p>Now, Wynn is back on the other side.</p>
      <p>“Isaiah always works hard,” head coach Bill Belichick said during his <a href="https://www.patriots.com/video/bill-belichick-on-status-of-sanu-and-dorsett-i-m-not-going-to-ouija-board-it-for">press conference</a> Friday. “He did a lot of scout-team work to get his timing back and all that, so working against the defense. Yeah, he works hard. He’s always ready to go.”</p>
      <p>Wynn would go as the sixth offensive lineman selected in 2018 behind Notre Dame’s Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey, UCLA’s Kolton Miller, Arkansas’ Frank Ragnow and Ohio State’s Billy Price. At 6-foot-2 and 310 pounds, the measurements said guard while the quick feet and technique said tackle.</p>
      <p>But the latter outweighs the former. Even if the towering Trent Brown <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverthomas/2019/03/12/in-the-end-left-tackle-trent-brown-and-the-patriots-both-walk-away-winners/#6dffb1934174">departed for the Oakland Raiders</a> on a four-year, $66 million pact in March. Even if Wynn has been healthy for roughly six quarters of a four-year, $11.4 million rookie deal featuring a $6.4 million signing bonus and an option for 2022.</p>
      <p>“Good football players play,” Scarnecchia added of Wynn. “They figure out ways. This guy knows how to play. That’s why we drafted him.”</p>
      <p>And that’s why Dallas is preparing to face him.</p>
      <p>“He plays the game with a competitive spirit and he’s a good player,” said the Cowboys’ Garrett. “He’s going to be a good player for a long time.”</p>
