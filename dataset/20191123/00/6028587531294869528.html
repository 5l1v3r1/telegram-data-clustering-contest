      <p>Conferences are not usually described as emotional, inspiring or thought provoking. But not all conferences are the largest Indigenous tourism conference in the world, either.Bringing together travel professionals, business owners, artists, creatives and culinary experts from across Canada, the 8<sup>th</sup> annual <a href="https://indigenoustourismconference.com/">International Indigenous Tourism Conference</a> (IITC) was held on the traditional and unceded territory of the Syilx Nation in beautiful <a href="https://www.tourismkelowna.com/">Kelowna, British Columbia.</a></p>
      <p>Jointly hosted by <a href="https://indigenoustourism.ca/corporate/">The Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada</a> (ITAC) and <a href="https://www.indigenousbc.com/">Indigenous Tourism BC</a> (ITBC) the conference spanned three days and included local cultural tours, rousing key note speaker addresses, music, dance, an awards ceremony and plenty of exciting news from the world’s largest growing travel market.</p>
      <p>Indigenous owned, operated and led travel companies are a booming industry offering authentic experiences and education with the latest travel trends showing visitors want more mindful tours and activities that offer a transformative travel experience.</p>
      <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/indigenous-tourism-sector-in-canada-exceeding-all-growth-targets-873771683.html">Indigenous tourism has seen phenomenal growth</a> and acceleration beyond overall tourism activity.

      <p>ITAC exists to champion and empower Indigenous people to own, operate, and excel in tourism roles and enterprises in 10 provinces and 3 territories across Canada.</p>
      <p>These businesses include restaurants, hotels, art galleries, cultural experiences, tours and more. During the course of the conference delegates and guests were treated to a range of performances and were led on cultural tours to community centers and businesses to listen and learn.</p>
      <p>Two outstanding performances that led to a standing ovation included a boot tapping musical fiddle show from <a href="https://doublethetrouble.net/">Double The Trouble</a>. These twin 15-year-old Cree and French- Metis boys delivered an energetic performance of traditional and modern songs.</p>
      <p>Another favorite performance during the event was by <a href="http://www.piqsiq.com/discover.html">PIQSIQ</a>. Sisters Kayley Inuksuk Mackay and Tiffany Kuliktana Ayalik are Inuit throat singers, and members of the Juno Award winning band, Quantum Tangle.</p>
      <p>Their performance was haunting and totally thrilled the crowd.</p>
