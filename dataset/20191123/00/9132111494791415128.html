      <p>Former President John Dramani Mahama has been hailed by NDC MP for Tamale North Alhassan Suhuyini as ‘Infrastructure King’.</p>
      <p>According to the lawmaker, Mr Mahama’s unprecedented record in the area of infrastructure puts him in a pole position of returning to power in 2020.</p>
      <p>“We have the infrastructure king coming back,” Alhassan Suhuyini said on TV3’s New Day on Friday, November 22.</p>
      <p>“His record is unprecedented.”</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the current government has proven that talk is cheap as no record of any physical structure is in its name.</p>
      <p>He challenged President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo to name any infrastructure project he has put up since assuming the presidency in 2017.</p>
      <p>For him, former president Mahama will win the 2020 elections to continue with his many projects, some of which have stalled since he left office.</p>
      <p>Mr Mahama is credited for a number of roads as well as projects including the E-blocks for new and existing senior high schools.</p>
