        <b>Question: If the UK leaves the EU, what changes can I expect when shopping online from a UK retailer?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Answer: EU consumer law will not apply to UK sales, including online sales, after it leaves  the EU. </p>
      <p>Therefore, your current consumer rights as provided for under EU consumer law will no longer be available.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are in a dispute with a UK-based trader, you may not be able to avail of the European Consumer Centre network or the European Small Claims Procedure. </p>
      <p>However, consumers in Ireland can take individual action through the Irish courts if they have purchased online from UK traders who do business in the EU. </p>
      <p>You should also be aware that following Brexit, you may have to pay certain taxes and duties when buying from the UK. </p>
      <p>You may have to pay customs duty, excise duty and VAT. These charges are calculated according to the value of the item and can include the transport costs. </p>
      <p>You can find detailed information about your consumer rights and Brexit on the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission website, ccpc.ie and on your consumer rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit on the europa.eu website.</p>
