      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 23 ― After Ninja and Shroud moved to Mixer, Jeremy “Disguised Toast” Wang is also leaving Twitch, this time in an exclusivity deal with Facebook Gaming.</p>
      <p>Facebook's livestreaming service for video game content, Facebook Gaming, has recruited <i>Hearthstone</i> and <i>Teamfight</i> <i>Tactics</i> player Jeremy Wang.</p>
      <p>Better known by his online handle Disguised Toast, Wang said that he was given a US$20,000 (RM83,438) budget to make an announcement video, but decided to donate it to St Jude's Childrens Hospital instead.</p>
      <p>Similarly, audience donations for his first month aboard Facebook Gaming will be going the same way.</p>
      <p>His move away from Amazon's well-established Twitch TV follows those by a number of other popular streamers, but is the first high-profile coup by Facebook Gaming.</p>
      <p>In October, Michael Grzesiek (aka shroud) followed Twitch's biggest streamer, Tyler Blevins (aka Ninja) in joining Microsoft platform Mixer.</p>
      <p>Ninja had announced an exclusivity deal in August.</p>
      <p>Jack Dunlop (aka CouRage) also left Twitch but as part of an exclusivity deal with Google's YouTube.</p>
      <p>Blevins, Grzesiek and Dunlop all specialised in first-person action games over the course of their time on Twitch, with Ninja and CouRage best associated with <i>Fortnite</i>, shroud with <i>Apex</i> <i>Legends</i>.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Wang is known for his preference for digital card game <i>Hearthstone</i> and subsequently a <i>League</i> <i>of</i> <i>Legends</i> spin-off <i>Teamfight</i> <i>Tactics</i>, part of an emerging and fast-growing Autochess or Auto Battler genre which combines elements from digital card games and multiplayer online battle arenas like <i>League of Legends</i> and <i>Dota</i> <i>2</i>.</p>
      <p>Facebook Gaming launched in March 2019. ― AFP-Relaxnews</p>
