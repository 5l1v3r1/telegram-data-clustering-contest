      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 23 ― Thanks to Google's Duplex technology, as of this week the Google Assistant can now navigate the web to book movie tickets online.</p>
      <p>Though users have been able to order movie tickets via the Google Assistant since last year, a new Duplex integration allows for the voice assistant to reserve seats, too.</p>
      <p>Already with Google's Duplex technology, the Assistant could book restaurant reservations over the phone on the owner's behalf; however, reserving a movie online requires more technical knowhow than making a call.</p>
      <p>Essentially, the Assistant can now navigate the web and guide users through the reservation process (on Chrome) which can be initiated by a user saying something like “Hey Google, showtimes for [movie title] in Phoenix this weekend.” The Assistant will automatically input any information necessary to book the movie as long as it's already saved to the browser.</p>
      <p>The Google Assistant can make movie reservations for over 70 theatres and ticketing services including AMC, Fandango, and MovieTickets.com. ― AFP-Relaxnews</p>
