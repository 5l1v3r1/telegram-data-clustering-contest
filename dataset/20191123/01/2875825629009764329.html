      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/freddie-mercury">Freddie Mercury</a> had one last request of his close friends as he lay in bed just days before his final breath.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 24 it will the 28th anniversary of Freddie's untimely death and as he was confined to bed, refusing to take his painkillers, he asked for one last favour.</p>
      <p>The Queen frontman was surrounded by his dearest friends and he told that he wished to see his famed art collection, one last time before he passed away.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Express Online, Freddie's best friend and PA Peter Freestone, recalled the final days of the acclaimed singer.</p>
      <p>Living with Freddie at One Garden Lodge for the final 12 years of his life, Freestone witnessed the legendary frontman become a frail victim of AIDS.</p>

      <p>Peter recalls that Freddie wanted to be brought downstairs in his West Kensington mansion one final time, to fulfill a dying wish.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the request, Peter said: "Freddie was downstairs in Garden Lodge on the 20th November, as he wanted to see some of his artworks for one last time..</p>
      <p>"Terry carried him down the stairs, but he walked around the sitting room and Japanese room, with one of us supporting him.</p>

      <p>"He commented on how and when he had acquired a few of the pieces [in his home]. Of course there was a quiet atmosphere in the house during those last days, but Freddie remained the Freddie we knew until the end."</p>
      <p>Terry Giddings was Freddie's bodyguard and chauffeur and he helped him get to the collection of art and antiques, that brought the singer such pleasure.</p>
      <p>Peter said the house was full paintings and lying syign in bed did not stop Freddie from expanding his collections.</p>
      <p>The singer was allegedly addicted to auctions and Elton John has recently recalled seeing Freddie before he died and that he was still buying artwork with just days left of his life.</p>
      <p>Elton said: "Freddie loved collecting Japanese art and collecting it at auction. So while he was dying he was still buying things at auction.</p>
      <p>"He would be surrounded on a bed and there’d be medicine all around him. Medicine cabinets and pills and auction catalogues.</p>

      <p>“It was astonishing. I thought, ‘This is amazing. This man has such a love of life. He’s not thinking about dying whatsoever. He’s still thinking about art’.</p>
      <p>"He showed no fear to me about dying. No fear or sadness."</p>
      <p>Freddie bequeathed the house to the love of his life, Mary Austin, and she has kept it exactly how it was before he died.</p>
