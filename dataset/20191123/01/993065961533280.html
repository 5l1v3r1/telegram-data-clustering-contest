      <p>BACK IN THE DAY</p>
      <p>BT Rannafast Cup final: Omagh CBS 3-13 St Patrick's, Armagh 1-10</p>
      <p>The Irish News, Monday November 23 2009: BT Rannafast Cup final: Omagh CBS 3-13 St Patrick's, Armagh 1-10</p>
      <p>CBS take Rannafast: Tyrone continues to rule the top grade of colleges' football on Saturday the BT Rannafast Cup shifted west from Dungannon to Omagh CBS after an enthralling final win against St Patrick's, Armagh.</p>
      <p>Ace forward Collie McRory and centre-back Tomas McCarron are already in the MacRory Cup squad. and Omagh joint-coach Ciaran Donnelly expects more to be added.</p>
      <p>The decisive score of the match was certainly Collie McRory's goal 17 minutes into the game.</p>
      <p>Armagh needed to show something for the first half when the stiff breeze assisted their efforts, but instead McRory's strike left them with a huge hill to climb after the break, trailing 1-4 to 0-5.</p>
      <p>Worse was to come five minutes into the second half when midfielder Stephen Kelly charged down the centre and planted a terrific shot in the bottom corner of the Armagh net.</p>
      <p>St Patrick's hit back with three points, two for Niall Patterson and another for Daniel McQuaid. However, the elements were against them and, as soon as Omagh re-asserted themselves with several points, there was only going to be one outcome. Philip Kelly fired in an Armagh goal near the end, but it was not going to rally his troops</p>
      <p>Omagh: R Brolly; J Gallagher, B Garrity, Colm O'Neill; M McCann, T McCarron, B O'Neill (0-1); S Kelly (1-1), B Donaghy; C McConnell, R Bradley (0-7), D Ball (0-1); C McClean, C McRory (1-2), Cormac O'Neill (0-1).</p>
      <p>Subs: T McGrath (1-0) for McClean.</p>
