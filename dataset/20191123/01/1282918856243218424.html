      <p>Al Pacino is all set to feature in Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele's upcoming Amazon Prime series called <i>Hunters</i>. The makers of the film dropped the trailer of the show featuring the veteran <i>Godfather</i> actor as the head of the pack of vigilantes who hunt down the Jews in the 1970s. Al Pacino will play the role of Meyer Offerman, the head of Nazi hunters in 1977 New York City who discover that hundreds of escaped Nazis are living in America.</p>
      <h4>Take a look at the teaser trailer of the series:</h4>

      <p>The trailer has Al Pacino's voiceover bringing a foreboding and sinister feel to the mission that he talks about. His speech continues with scenes from the series where the characters follow clues and hunt down the Nazi suspects one by one. Al Pacino's baritone voice in an authoritative tone is spine-chilling as he says, “The time to act is now, before everything we hold near to us is destroyed. This is not murder — it is mitzvah. Welcome to the hunt.”</p>
