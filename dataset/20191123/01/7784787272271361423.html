      <h3>This time last year, Chayce Jones and Ned McHenry were hours away from being selected by Adelaide in the first-round of the National Draft.</h3>
      <p>On Saturday morning, the teenage pair finished first and second in the Crows’ 2km time-trial to make an early statement this pre-season, under the watch of new senior coach Matthew Nicks.</p>
      <p>Defender Jake Kelly finished behind Jones and McHenry, with ruckman Reilly O’Brien and half-back Brodie Smith rounding out the top five.</p>

      <p>While McHenry is yet to make his debut, Jones received his first taste of league football in Round 1 and finished his maiden season with eight senior games under his belt.</p>
      <p>Jones, who the Crows selected at Pick 9 last November before taking McHenry at Pick 16, relishes the competition with the small forward who could fill the void left by departed star Eddie Betts in the coming years.</p>
      <p>“We’ve run a couple of times together, it’s probably about even now,” Jones told reporters in North Adelaide on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It’s good competition and it makes you better out of it all.”</p>

      <p>After arriving from Tasmania weighing in at 77kg, Jones has added a few kilograms in his first 12 months at the club and will continue to focus on building his frame over the summer.</p>
      <p>He finished the season with career-high 18 disposals, seven marks four tackles and two goals against the Western Bulldogs and is now eyeing more time in the middle in 2020.</p>
      <p>“It’s nice to keep (my time) relatively similar to last year while putting on a few kilos,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I definitely want to push myself to get in the (midfield) so it’s all about putting your foot forward in the pre-season.”</p>
