      <p>NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Piyush-Goyal">Piyush Goyal</a> told Parliament on Friday that reform momentum towards self-certification, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/labour-laws">labour laws</a> and environment clearance will boost <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/wealth/invest">investment</a> and production.</p>
      <p>“Recently, several short-term and long-term measures have been announced to boost investment, production and demand,” Goyal said in a written reply to a question in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> on the steps the government proposes to take to review investments, production and demand.</p>
      <p>He said while global growth is forecast at 3% for 2019, its lowest level since 2008-09 as per the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Economic-Outlook">World Economic Outlook</a> of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Monetary-Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, India continues to grow faster than the rest of the world. “The government has been continuously taking measures to boost investment, production and demand through its initiatives such as Make in India, Startup India, Ease of Doing Business, Business Reform Action Plan, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy and sectoral schemes/programmes. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Foreign-Direct-Investment">Foreign Direct Investment</a> (FDI) policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively,” said Goyal.</p>
      <p>He said corporate tax rate has been cut to 22% for domestic companies and 15% for new domestic manufacturing companies; drive initiated for GST refund to micro, small and medium enterprises within 30 days, ban lifted on purchase of new vehicles in ministries and departments, and tax benefits provided to boost demand of vehicles.</p>
      <p>The government has made upfront released Rs 70,000 crore to state-run banks and made additional provision for lending and liquidity of Rs 5 lakh crore to increase credit flow to industries, said Goyal. To bolster consumption and demand, the commerce and industry minister said, banks have cut interest rates, a move that would lead to lower equated monthly instalments for home, auto and other loans.</p>
