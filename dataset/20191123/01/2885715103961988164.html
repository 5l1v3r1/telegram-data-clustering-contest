      <p>These days anybody can mistake Kolkata for a pink city.</p>

      <p>In tune with the pink ball debut here, all famous buildings of the city have been lit up in the same colour, apart from the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Even municipal corporation parks, Maidan tents as well as ferries on Hooghly river have been lit up in pink.</p>
      <p>But, how can the city of foodies remain behind when it comes to sweets?</p>
      <p>Keeping the excitement in mind, many sweet shops have been selling pink and cricket ball-shaped sweets in Kolkata.</p>
      <p>“We cash in all the festival and opportunities in Kolkata. Since it’s also a unique occasion, we decided to prepare pink sweets. People have been buying it in good numbers,” said Shankar Das, a sweet shop owner in Kolkata.</p>
      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sourav-ganguly/">Sourav Ganguly</a>, the president of Board of Control for Cricket in India, too was left amazed by the sight of pink sweets in Kolkata. He too shared some photos of these pink sweets on his Twitter handle on Friday.</p>
      <p>“Sweets go pink in Kolkata,” Ganguly captioned the picture of a pink sandesh.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, tight security arrangements have been made near the stadium.</p>
      <p>Around 3,000 policemen have been deployed at the stadium. The Anti-rowdy Squad of the Detective Department has been maintaining vigil and conducting drives against ticket black marketeers for the last two days. They have arrested 12 people in the last two days and seized several tickets too.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, six black marketeers were arrested with 40 tickets. All of them were taken to Maidan police station.</p>
      <p>A day before, police had arrested another six persons and seized 38 tickets from their possession.</p>
      <p>Transport Department has also arranged 25 additional buses for ferrying cricket buffs to different parts of the city and Howrah from Eden Gardens after the day’s match. The buses have been parked at Esplanade stand and will start leaving from 8 pm. The police have been asked to inform the audience about the location of the buses once they step out of the stadium after the day’s match gets over by 8 pm. The buses will be available till 10pm.</p>
