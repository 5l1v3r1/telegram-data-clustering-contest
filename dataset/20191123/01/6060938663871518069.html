      <p>NEW DELHI: Ashok Aram has been CEO for Deutsche Bank’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (MENA) markets since November 2015. Additionally, in November 2018, he was appointed head of private and commercial banking (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/international">international</a>). In July 2019, he became a member of the bank’s group management committee. In an interview with TOI, he explains why India is important for the bank, despite its efforts to conserve capital.</p>

        <b>What kind of growth do you expect in India?</b>
      </p>
      <p>India is at a phase where even without much effort, the economy would grow at 4-5% just because of the input-output factors and the fact that demographics are favourable. If you look at economic history, you saw this happen in East Asia 15-20 years ago and in China about 15 years ago where the middle class expands, urbanisation happens and more labour comes into the workforce.</p>
      <p>If you’re sitting in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Europe-today">Europe today</a>, you’re almost envious of this. In addition to the baseline growth of 5%, whenever you have a period of good forward-looking policy changes, structural stages, fluidity of all factors — labour technology capital — you get another 200-300 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) of growth, which is probably, give or take a little, where India is today. If you then add another layer to that, which is a globally supportive environment where energy prices are moderate, and you have good growth happening in your key export markets, growth can be higher.</p>
      <p>As far as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Deutsche-Bank">Deutsche Bank</a> is concerned, we believe that as long as you do not go overboard, you can have a very steady and sustainable business here for years to come. These trends have at least 20 years left in them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will the group’s cost cutting measures impact India?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even if Deutsche Bank itself is going through a fundamental transformation and is rationalising costs, in India, we are growing in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/retail-banking">retail banking</a>. Our retail presence in India also fits in very well with our corporate advisory, transactional banking and wealth management strategy in the country.</p>
      <p>And of course, clients need support in areas such as foreign exchange and trade. So our global markets business also fits nicely into this portfolio, which makes me very optimistic about Deutsche Bank in India.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What kind of capital is DB willing to commit?</b>
      </p>
      <p>In spite of all our capital-bolstering efforts, we put 500 million euros (about Rs 4,000 crore) of fresh capital into our India business earlier this year, which is a demonstration of our commitment to growing the India franchise. How many other foreign banks have done that? I personally believe that as the economy here grows and our India business does too, when Deutsche Bank India comes and makes another proposal for additional capital, they should have no problem.</p>
      <p>The constraint, in my view, is not capital. For a retail banking business like Deutsche Bank’s, it is not even funding. I think the real constraint has been with our spend on technology. How much in technology dollars can you deploy? And how much technology dollars can you divert into your growth plans? That, I would argue, is the number one constraint. But we are working on changing this. We have already announced our intent to invest 13 billion euros in technology by the year 2022. In India, our retail business is partnering with fintechs to digitise some of our processes, products and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/services">services</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Has there been any pullback from retail?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We are fully committed to our retail business in India and are, in fact, looking at ways to grow it. Our definition of retail is not mortgages and auto loans. We are not a pure play mass <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/commercial-bank">commercial bank</a>. Though we run a mortgage and personal loan book, they are for existing customers.</p>
      <p>On the lending side, 95% of our balance sheet is to businesses. Retail banking for us is largely MSME and affluent individual clients. From a customer’s perspective, the most appealing thing about Deutsche Bank is the access we provide to Europe and to global capital. Clients that value the insight we offer are the ones who need it the most to take their businesses to the next level.</p>
      <p>The top companies in India have gone deep into globalisation. It is the next level of companies — ones with an annual turnover of Rs 250-500 crore — to whom what we offer would make complete sense. Because this is the segment which will value this insight the most.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which are the businesses that DB will focus on in India?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deutsche Bank in India has a presence in corporate banking, global markets, private banking, retail banking and even niche corporate finance. These are businesses that we are strongly committed to and will continue to grow. The full spectrum of services that we offer in India, we do only in about six or seven countries in the world. Apart from India, all of them are in Europe.</p>
