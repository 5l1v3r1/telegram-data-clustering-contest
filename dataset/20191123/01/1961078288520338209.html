      <h1>Fiona Hill and the American Idea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:41:01+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:41</time> by <a rel="author">Roger Cohen</a></address>
      <p>For a naturalized American, raised in Britain, I found <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/21/us/politics/fiona-hill-opening-statement-ukraine.html?module=inline">Fiona Hill’s testimony at impeachment hearings</a> this week to be a powerful reminder of what makes America great and of how President Trump has taken a sledgehammer to “its role as a beacon of hope in the world.”</p>
      <p>That is how Hill’s father, Alfred, a coal miner from the age of 14, always viewed the United States. He wanted to emigrate from County Durham in northern England, but an ailing mother who “had been crippled from hard labor” kept him from seeking the new opportunity his daughter found. American possibility contrasted for Hill with British prejudice. A “very distinctive working-class accent” would have “impeded my professional advancement” in the England of the 1980s and ’90s, she told the House Intelligence Committee. That same accent cut through bloviating Republicans like a knife.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/us/politics/who-is-fiona-hill.html?module=inline">Hill rose in her adopted country</a> to serve three presidents as an expert on Russia and the former Soviet republics, including Ukraine. She was the top Russia and Europe expert on Trump’s National Security Council until she quit in July. It was devastating to hear her lambaste, without naming them, the shameless Republicans who have embraced a “fictional narrative” propagated “by the Russian security services themselves” under which Ukraine, not Russia, attacked American democratic institutions in 2016. “It is beyond dispute,” she declared, that Russia was the foreign power that “systematically” did this.</p>
      <p>Moscow succeeded, Hill suggested. “Our nation is being torn apart. Truth is questioned. Our highly professional and expert career foreign service is being undermined.” Russia aims at nothing less than destroying Americans’ faith in their democracy. American support for Ukraine, under attack from Russia, has been “politicized,” a succinct summation of Trump’s reduction of a major European country, struggling to emerge from the mind-bending legacy of the Soviet imperium, to a potential source of dirt on a political opponent. If this is not abuse of power, what is?</p>
      <p>Never before have I felt such overwhelming disgust at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/opinion/donald-trump-russia-putin.html?module=inline">Trump’s weird, unexplained, unquestioning, total embrace of Vladimir Putin</a>, in effect an act of presidential connivance in an attack on the United States. The cri de coeur of Hill, for whom America was hope, was shattering.</p>
      <p>Trump is Putin’s stooge. The American president’s contempt for Ukraine’s fate is quintessentially Russian, for, in the mythology of Greater Russia, Ukraine as an independent state is a mere illusion (hence Putin helps himself to Crimea). Never before have I felt with such acuity — except perhaps during the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/opinion/marie-yovanovitch-impeachment.html?module=inline">earlier testimony of Marie Yovanovitch</a>, the former American ambassador to Ukraine — how the public service of dedicated patriots is under attack from Trump’s diplomacy as an exercise in narcissism. In these two cases, of course, it’s narcissism compounded by misogyny.</p>
      <p>For me, Hill’s words went deeper still. My own encounter with British prejudice was different, that of a Jew, the son of South African immigrants, with the anti-Semitism that cast me as a “yid” in my first year or two at high school. The prejudice that, for immigrants bent above all on assimilation, was best met with silence when “Don’t be so Jewish!” was wielded to mean don’t be so stingy, or someone was referred to as looking Jewish, “with her great conk of a nose.” American citizenship — the miraculous, ever renewed gathering-in of strangers made equal before the law — was also liberation from all that. It was belonging, as opposed to not quite belonging.</p>
      <p>So when <a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1197599228039700481">Hill spoke of the United States as a “country of immigrants”</a> and said that “this is what for me really does make America great,” and said, “This is the essence of America. It’s why I wanted to be here, and why I wanted to stay here,” and said, “This is my country and the country that I serve” — when she said all that in her no-nonsense north England accent, I could not help feeling again in all its force the American idea as release from class prejudice, as release from bigotry, as liberation from the tyranny of who came first and who came last. Europeans ask, where do you come from? Americans ask, what can you do for us?</p>
      <p>This is the very revolutionary American idea under attack from Trump and his Republican enablers and the Fox News fabulists. Make America Great Again is, in fact, Deny What America Is. It’s a frontal attack on the rule of law, the foundation of democracy. For Trump, the law has always been something to be finessed or circumvented.</p>
      <p>Over the past week, it’s been impossible to ignore the parallels between the United States and Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responds to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-indicted.html?module=inline">indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust</a> with cries of “attempted coup” and “my blood has been spilled.” This parallels Trump’s response to the impeachment inquiry as “witch hunt” and “lynching” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/us/politics/trump-deep-state-impeachment.html?module=inline">and “deep state” conspiracy.</a></p>
      <p>The flailing of giant egos possessed of an infallibility syndrome against the beautiful idea that nobody is above the law poses a decisive test for American and Israeli democracy. Alfred Hill, his daughter said, “always wanted someone in the family to make it to the United States.” Fiona Hill could not have given a more powerful or important expression of why. Her truth made Republicans squirm, because no “beacon of hope” can survive their craven sellout.</p>
