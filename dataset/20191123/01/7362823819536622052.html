      <h1>Warren told pro-school-choice activist she sent her kids to public school, campaign says otherwise</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:33:22+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:33</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wulfsohn</a></address>
      <p>On Thursday, Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, D-Mass., told a school choice activist in Atlanta that she had sent both of her children to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education">public school</a>. On Friday, her campaign told a different story.</p>
      <p>In a video that was originally uploaded on social media, Sarah Carpenter of the Powerful Parent Network challenged Warren's opposition to charter schools, at one point saying: "We are going to have the same choice that you had for your kids because I read that your children went to private schools."</p>
      <p>"My children went to public schools," Warren told Carpenter.</p>
      <p>However, a yearbook obtained by <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/video-warren-confronted-by-school-choice-activist-over-sending-son-to-private-school/">The Washington Free Beacon</a> showed Warren's son Alex attended Kirby Hall School during the 1986-1987 school year. The online publication reported that the school currently charges nearly $15,000 per year for tuition, up from $4,700 in 1995, the earliest year for which records are available.</p>

      <p>"Elizabeth's daughter went to public school. Her son went to public school until 5th grade," a Warren aide told Fox News. "Elizabeth wants every kid to get a great education regardless of where they live, which is why her plan makes a historic investment in our public schools. Every public school should be a great school. Her plan does not affect funding for existing non-profit charter schools, but she believes we should not put public dollars behind a further expansion of charters until they are subject to the same accountability requirements as public schools."</p>
      <p>Warren's rally in Atlanta on Thursday night was disrupted by a large group of school choice activists.</p>
      <p>“Fighters I want to talk about tonight are black women,” Warren began, drawing applause and cheers. “As a white woman, I will never fully understand the discrimination, the pain, the harm that black Americans have experienced just because of the color of their skin."</p>

      <p>Suddenly some protesters began chanting: “Our children, our choice!" as Warren tried to speak over them.</p>
      <p>Warren supporters then tried to drown out the protesters by chanting "Warren!" "Warren!"</p>
      <p>The protesters then countered with “Dream big, our choice!”</p>
      <p>“All right, so let’s talk a little,” Warren said, attempting to engage with the dissenters.</p>
      <p>But the protesters continued chanting, first "We want to be heard!” and then back to “Our children, our choice!”</p>
