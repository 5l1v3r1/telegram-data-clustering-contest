      <p>TERENCE Donnelly, executive chairman of the north's largest family-owned new and used vehicle dealership the Donnelly Group, has received the lifetime achievement award at the Mid Ulster Business Excellence Awards at Corick House.</p>
      <p>From humble beginnings in 1947 in Caledon on the border of counties Armagh and Tyrone, he has overseen a remarkable growth in the company, which sells more than 15,000 vehicles a year from its nine locations, and employs more than 700 people staff.</p>
      <p>Terence was nominated for the accolade by members of the Donnelly Group team, who were present on the night to support him.</p>
      <p>Group managing director Dave Sheeran said: “Terence's award is hugely deserved. Since joining his father in the family business in 1969, he has led the Donnelly Group through its expansion, with a simple business ethos of ‘keeping the customer central to everything we do'.”</p>
      <p>“Terence has always been an innovator, placing Donnelly Group at the centre of change in an ever evolving industry.</p>
      <p>“In 2010 he was one of the founding members of the Northern Ireland e-Car consortium which provided the charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, which will be the biggest growth sector in the industry in the coming years.”</p>
      <p>Terence has received numerous accolades over the years, having previously been nominated for an Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the year award, and is a recipient of the Volkswagen Diamond pin - the highest individual award from Volkswagen celebrating service to the brand.</p>
      <p>He also received a personal thanks from Nobel Peace Prize award-winner Desmond Tutu for the provision of 50 vehicles for an African charity.</p>
      <p>Over the years Terence has advocated Donnelly Group support for a range of partnerships with GAA, rugby and football clubs, Clogher Valley Show, Omagh Show, and has provided financial support for charities such as the Michaela Foundation, Macmillan, Special Olympics and Air Ambulance NI.</p>
      <p>This year in memory of his father Peter Donnelly, the Donnelly Group Foundation has been established, to co-ordinate all of the community-based projects across the north.</p>
