      <p><b>ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDSÂ (AP)</b> - Jarron Cumberland scored 23 points, including the game-winner with eight seconds left as Cincinnati rallied to defeat Illinois State 66-65 in the U.S. Virgin Islands Paradise Jam on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Chris Vogt had 13 points and 13 rebounds for Cincinnati (3-1). Tre Scott added 14 points and Keith Williams 12 for Cincinnati.</p>
      <p>Dedric Boyd scored 18 points for the Redbirds (2-2), Zach Copeland added 12 points.</p>
      <p>Illinois State slowly widened a 33-30 halftime lead to 10 points midway through the second half when Boyd buried a jumper to make it 57-47. Cincinnati, which was 21 of 28 at the foul line to the Redbirds' 5 of 9, used free throws to nibble away at the lead.</p>
      <p>Cumberland hit a 3 that cut the gap to 63-60 with just under three minutes to go, and Williams drove for a layup, making it a one-point game, 63-62.</p>
      <p>With 34 seconds remaining, Williams fed to Scott for a dunk and the Cincinnati lead, 64-63. Illinois State answered with a dunk, but Cumberland scored the winner with a layup and Illinois State missed a 3-point try with two seconds left.</p>
      <p>Cincinnati plays UNLV at home next Saturday. Illinois State plays Illinois-Springfield at home next Friday.</p>
