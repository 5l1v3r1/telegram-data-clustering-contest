        <figcaption>Hurling (Irish: Iománaíocht/Iomáint) is an outdoor team game of ancient Gaelic and Irish origin, administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). The game has prehistoric origins, has been played for over 3,000 years,and is considered to be the world's fastest field sport.One of Ireland's native Gaelic games, it shares a number of features with Gaelic football, such as the field and goals, number of players, and much terminology. There is a similar game for women called camogie (camógaíocht). It shares a common Gaelic root with the sport of shinty (camanachd) which is played predominantly in Scotland.</figcaption>

      <p>In the wake of recent criticisms surrounding the ‘Winner on the Day' approach to Ulster Club Championship games, the GAA's Ulster Council has moved to clarify the position.</p>
      <p>Colm McGuinness, manager of Eoghan Ruadh Dungannon, who lost the Ulster Club IHC final last weekend on penalties, was among those who hit out earlier this week, insisting it was a totally unacceptable method of settling drawn games.</p>
      <p>But yesterday the Ulster Council pointed out that the GAA's Official Guide stipulated a winner had to be found on the day.</p>
      <p>Their statement read as follows: ``In recent weeks, a number of commentators have queried why Ulster GAA have used 'Winner on the Day' in the Ulster Club Championship.</p>
      <p>``To date, three of our 2019 Provincial Club Championship games have proceeded to penalties when the teams finished level after extra time.</p>
      <p>``These included the Ulster Intermediate Hurling Club Final between Naomh Eanna and Eoghan Ruadh, Dungannon on Sunday 18th November.</p>
      <p>``Ulster GAA wish to clarify that we have no discretion in this matter as the Official Guide T.O. 2019 Part 2 Rule 3.6 (b) states that all games in the Provincial Club Championships shall be decided by 'Winner on the Day'.</p>
      <p>``It should be noted that Club Championship games in other provinces, most recently Leinster, have also been subject to this process.''</p>
