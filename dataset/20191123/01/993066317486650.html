      <p>Woman's Hour - BBC Radio 4</p>
      <p>WOMAN'S Hour is always my go-to for a strong mix of news and features and the odd light recipe.</p>
      <p>The weekend 'Best of...' version is a pick 'n' mix that offers a little of everything - from gold diggers to the Catholic Church and women priests, to how to make chilli tofu... if that's your thing.</p>
      <p>Take intriguing questions - there are none more intriguing that those asked at the water cooler and that is where you might discover that you are paid less than a male colleague doing the same job.</p>
      <p>That's what happened to Kay Collins who found out a man doing the same job as her was on £22,000 while she was only on £16,000. She won her case, but lost her job, she told Woman's Hour.</p>
      <p>It is 25 years since the Church of England first admitted women into priesthood but Catholics are still waiting even though the Church is struggling to find enough men to do the job.</p>
      <p>Miriam Dunigan believes passionately in the cause.</p>
      <p>She told Woman's Hour how that passion stemmed from her own childhood in north London where she attended a convent school.</p>
      <p>She was just 12 years old when she asked the nuns could Jesus come back as a girl. She was told off for being blasphemous.</p>
      <p>On another occasion when the priest did not show up to say Mass, she asked the head nun if she might do it... and was told very firmly that could not happen.</p>
      <p>Soline Humbert is a woman who has a calling to the priesthood, even if it is not recognised by the powers that be.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the Pope has said no to women priests but Soline has faith in a changing world.</p>
      <p>"Doors that are firmly shut have a way sometimes of springing open," she said softly but firmly.</p>
      <p>Miriam believes it is demeaning that people like Soline - "a beautiful priest" - cannot feel that vocation.</p>
      <p>But they are forward-thinking women. Perhaps married men will be accepted as priests first, but for women, the tide will turn and the old order will change, they believe.</p>
      <p>"I'm hoping, like the Berlin Wall, it's going to crumble in the end," said Miriam.</p>
