      <h2>Both Ferrari drivers are to blame for their Interlagos crash</h2>

      <p>That is the view of outspoken 1997 world champion Jacques Villeneuve, after team boss Mattia Binotto said of the incident: “It’s not for me to blame them”.</p>
      <p>Villeneuve, however, told Sky Italia: “Vettel and Leclerc are allowed to fight among themselves, but they should not abuse this freedom.</p>
      <p>“In my opinion, they are both to blame. Leclerc was too aggressive, and Vettel should not have immediately slammed the door when overtaking his teammate.</p>
      <p>“They both made a mistake,” Villeneuve insisted.</p>
      <p>“It was unnecessary, as they were fighting for third place at most. I think they just wanted to show everyone that they are the better one.”</p>
      <p>Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper reports that Binotto will meet with Ferrari CEO Louis Camilleri at Maranello on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The report said they will discuss potential penalties for repeat incidents, including driver fines and other “disciplinary measures”.</p>
      <p>Former Ferrari driver Rubens Barrichello, who was at Interlagos last Sunday, told Bild newspaper: “It was a misunderstanding between the two drivers and a sad day for Ferrari.”</p>
      <p>As for 2020, both Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc are staying put, but Sky Deutschland commentator Sascha Roos says Ferrari needs to plan ahead.</p>
      <p>“I think they would be well advised to set a deadline,” he said. “For example, after the first four races of the season, a number 1 driver is made.”</p>
