      <p>DO YOU know a movie buff aged between five and 19? Education charity Into Film has launched its new competition The Big Review of The Year, a search for Northern Ireland's top young movie reviewer.</p>
      <p>Sean Kelly from Into Film said: "2019 has been another incredible year for film with so many wonderful new stories making their way to the screen. We want to encourage children and young people across Northern Ireland to get writing and enter a review of any film they've seen this year in our competition.</p>
      <p>"Writing movie reviews is a great way for children to develop literacy skills, to learn to express themselves creatively and to think analytically about what they've seen."</p>
      <p>"We're hoping to discover the next Mark Kermode," he added.</p>
      <p>Film reviews can come from schools or individuals and can be any film that the young person has watched this year, whether it's a current release or an old classic, seen in a cinema or on DVD or streamed at home. Prizes include tablets, TVs, DVD bundles and family cinema passes.</p>
      <p>To enter, email peter.murray@intofilm.org or post entries to Into Film, The Big Film Review 2019, 521 Scottish Provident Building, Donegal Sq West, Belfast BT1 6JH. The deadline for school entries is December 20 and for individual entries it is January 5.</p>
