      <p>RARE documents and previously unknown information about an ancient burial ground in rural Co Derry have been unearthed.</p>
      <p>The discovery was made by a group of people researching the history of an area known as the Loup, which stretches from near Magherafelt to the shores of Lough Neagh.</p>
      <p>Inspired by the restoration of the local St Patrick's Chapel, the group formed the Loup and District Historical Society with the aim of recording and detailing the area's local history.</p>
      <p>And less than a year after they were established, they are set to launch their first book.</p>
      <p>Around the Loup records the history of the area as well as the wider Ardtrea parish from the earliest times to the mid 1900s.</p>
      <p>It draws on oral history, historical documents and artefacts, which local families shared, with all the historical records of events and activities in the area collated into the new publication.</p>
      <p>During the research, two original letters written in 1847 at the height of the Famine in Ireland were discovered.</p>
      <p>The letters came from the rectors of Magherafelt and Moneymore, who were the chairmen of the their local soup committees, and who describe the deprivation in the area.</p>
      <p>The book also looks at the importance of the Port of Ballyronan in the 1800s, the Plantation and sporting activities in the area including a report on cock-fighting.</p>
      <p>There are also details of the area in penal times and how Mass had to be said on 'mass rocks' and how one such service led to a famous riot at the Loup.</p>
      <p>Another chapter looks at emigration with a rare 1854 application form to become an American citizen included.</p>
      <p>And there are also fascinating details about a newly commissioned geophysical survey of Old Ballyeglish Graveyard, which has raised the possibility of an ancient burial ground.</p>
      <p>Sean Corey, who is a member of the historical society, said: "We got together to mark the renovation of the chapel and soon after someone suggested doing a book.</p>
      <p>"It really just mushroomed from there and from what we had planned, which was an A4 type book, has blossomed into a 360 page book.</p>
      <p>"There were a number of fascinating discoveries we made including two letters describing the Famine in the area in great detail.</p>
      <p>"We also have come across a lot of artefacts and facts from the chapel as well as all the information from local families who shared stories, poems and songs."</p>
      <p>The book will be launched tonight at Patrick's Loup GAC clubrooms with an exhibition of historical items related to the book also taking place prior to the event.</p>
      <p>Copies and original documentation and historical artefacts will go on display, including a six-foot crocodile which had been stuffed and brought home from overseas missions and a 100-year-old altar box used in the West Indies for saying Mass.</p>
      <p>There is also a WWII gas mask and rare books utilised in the research of Around the Loup and a full list of Penal Laws.</p>
      <p>Dr Roddy Hegarty, director of the Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiaich Memorial Library and Archive is due to speak at the event, which begins at 7pm.</p>
      <p>The book will be available to purchase at the event priced at £20.</p>
