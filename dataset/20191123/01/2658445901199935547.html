      <p>The family is God’s delight.     When God delights in you and you delight in Him, He makes your life and your home a delightful place. If it is joy you need, He gives it to you. If it is money that is in short supply, God releases it. If it is peace that is required, He brings peace. Everything it takes for your family to succeed is made available. When God delights in your family, everyone against your family progress is silenced and you enjoy all-round security and speedy answers to your prayers.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, when your delight is in Him, your life will always be on the increase (Psalm 18:19); God will promote you and you will enjoy abundance in every area of your life. God’s Word says: <b><i>Thou shalt no more be termed forsaken; neither shall thy land anymore be termed desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lord <u>DELIGHTETH</u> in thee, and thy land shall be married </i>(Isaiah 62:4). </b>This is God Word’s for you right now.</p>
      <p>Every successful home is a threat to satan’s kingdom, which is why he would do anything to destroy it.  Unfortunately, he gains entrance to many homes often through the woman. Remember, he gained access into the first home through Eve, and history always repeats itself. God’s Word says:<b> <i>But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ </i>(2 Corinthians 11:3).</b></p>
      <p>For this reason, men should protect their wives spiritually, to ensure that they do not engage in private discussions with hell, which can send them out of their “garden”.  Once the woman is effectively shielded from satan, he will have difficulty in trying to penetrate the home.</p>
      <p>Women are more susceptible to the attacks of satan, because of their roles in the home.  She is usually more at home than the man; so, she is more available to satan. He creeps in on her and tells her, “What makes you different from the man? Are you a slave? Have you forgotten that you too are educated as he (husband) is? Have you forgotten your placement in your office? There is no Jew nor Greek, male or female; the same Lord is rich over all.” If unguarded, the woman would be tempted to agree with him.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Somehow, satan is able to easily secure the attention of women, particularly when they are idle.  He barrages them with all sorts of negative information, which in turn makes them unhappy. He often arrests them by painting a deadly picture of calamity and woe, which they readily accept. But unfortunately, some women claim that it was God that revealed such information to them, not recognizing that it came through “the prince of the power of the air.”</p>
      <p>Woman, please learn to prove the source of the information that comes to you.  Find things out for yourself from the Word of God, because nothing anybody says can make the Word of no effect.  The destruction many families have experienced today came from information that had satanic sources.</p>
      <p>Man, it is time to awake and chase satan out of your garden! Until you say, “Get thee behind this family, satan”, he will keep hanging around. As man’s eternal enemy, satan has vowed to pull down the family unit.  God’s Word says: <b><i>How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up? (</i>Deuteronomy 32:30).</b> He wants to stop you from destroying his kingdom.</p>
      <p>In the covenant, one can deal with 1,000, two, especially in marriage, are empowered to put 10,000 to flight!  Satan knows this and wants to keep his kingdom; so, he launches attacks on the family, to prevent them from destroying his kingdom.  Since one family can destroy 10,000 demons, Satan aims at destroying the 10,000 capacity destroyers.  If he succeeds, he has preserved more demons to run errands for him.</p>
      <p>Another reason the devil wants to gain entrance into families is found in I Peter 3:7; <b><i>Likewise, ye husband, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</i></b></p>
      <p>When a man and his wife are at variance with each other, their prayers are hindered, and they are disconnected from God.  They may pray all the time, but there will be no response from heaven.  Heaven will be shut, making it impossible for them to enjoy the harvest of whatever seed they may have sown.</p>
      <p>The man, who opens up his home to malice or discord, has blocked his access to God’s blessing.  Satan knows this, so he does all he can to see that there is rancour and strife between a man and his wife.  Anytime you sense any animosity rising within you against your spouse, know that satan is seeking an entrance.  Therefore, resist him steadfastly in the faith.  Tell yourself that since you have no intention of having another home, you will not give satan a foothold in your family!</p>
      <p>In case you are not yet born again, this is another opportunity for you to do so today. If you want to overcome satanic loopholes in your family this year, don’t miss this golden opportunity. You can become born again by confessing your sins and accepting Jesus as your Saviour and Lord. If you are ready for this new birth experience, please say this prayer:<b><i> Dear Lord Jesus Christ, I come to You today. I am a sinner. Forgive me my sins and cleanse me with Your Blood. I accept You as my Lord and personal Saviour. Make me a child of God today. Thank You for delivering me from sin and satan to serve the living God and thank You for accepting me into Your Kingdom.</i></b></p>
      <p>Congratulations! If you prayed this simple prayer of faith with me, you are born again and now a child of God. He loves you and will never leave you. Read your Bible daily; obey God’s Word and seek Christian fellowship (John 14:21). With this, you are guaranteed all-round rest and peace in Jesus’ name!
