      <p>Sniper has been banned, but not this.</p>
      <p>Like an unsolved arithmetic, I have no answer to it. It’s there in my head.</p>
      <p>It has become my nightmare. Deep in my thoughts, there it is, seated in confidence!</p>
      <p>We are entangled!</p>
      <p>There’s absolutely no way out.</p>
      <p>What have I not done in this life?</p>
      <p>How unfair can life be?</p>
      <p>I act like it is all okay just to meet up with the life, but here I am, in the middle of nowhere fizzling away.</p>
      <p>I feel like God has blown me away like the beans shaft.</p>
      <p>I am dying inside.</p>
      <p>Yes, I have dreams, BIG DREAMS, but they remain mere dreams, as life has conditioned them to remain so, they never wake up.</p>
      <p>My mates are already in school, I’m here ‘jambing’ JAMB; Still being posted by post UME.</p>
      <p>My mates are done and dusted, graduation and matriculation pictures flirting on my timeline. And you say I should hold on? Hold on for what?</p>
      <p>It is too late for me already!</p>
      <p>My nudes leaked</p>
      <p>My reputation destroyed</p>
      <p>My dreams chattered</p>
      <p>No one cares</p>
      <p>I’m a disappointment to my family.</p>
      <p>And you say I should continue living? Live for what? When I can’t even raise my head in public.</p>
      <p>I feel like the worst person in this world!</p>
      <p>I am a good person, Oh yes I am!</p>
      <p>I have helped people, I do charity;</p>
      <p>But I can’t even get back the good I’ve done! Everyone plays dumb and oblivious of my condition.</p>
      <p>I feel useless, there’s no hope for me in this life!</p>
      <p>Too much bad luck! So unfortunate!</p>
      <p>Lemme just die! There’s nothing to live for!</p>
      <p>Ladies who are not even as beautiful as I am are getting married</p>
      <p>My guys, who are less intelligent than I are getting jobs. But me? What do I get? NOTHING!</p>
      <p>What do you expect?</p>
      <p>No, tell me!</p>
      <p>They keep giving me useless hopes, “HOPE IN THE LORD”.</p>
      <p>Which hope? Has God not been aware of my situation? =Ø Þ What did He do?</p>
      <p>‘Have faith’, they say.</p>
      <p>Shut up! Don’t ever speak about faith to me!</p>
      <p>Don’t tell me about the Bible because there’s nothing I have not heard!</p>
      <p>It is ten months into the New Year, ooops, the “Old-New year”. December is already by the corner, and boom! There comes 2020! What do I have to show for this year? Nothing!</p>
      <p>I can no longer condone this bugbear when sadness is spilling from my back pockets. And poverty running down my veins. I take full responsibility for my incapacitatedness, so allow me surcease this tragedy called ‘LIFE’.</p>
      <p>I have had enough!</p>
