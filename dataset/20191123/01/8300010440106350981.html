      <p>Bad weather can greatly affect travel in the 1,200-mile stretch facing the storm's path Wednesday, when travel is already expected to take four times as long without bad weather, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2019/11/aaa-more-than-55-million-travelers-taking-to-the-roads-and-skies-this-thanksgiving/">according to AAA</a>.<br/><br/>A worst case scenario could bring widespread and heavy snow to some of the Midwest.<br/><br/>Busy travel hub Chicago has the potential to be in the middle of the worst or may completely avoid it. Either way, <a href="https://abc7.com/travel/thanksgiving-travel-rush-likely-to-shatter-records/5694761/">ripple-effect airline delays</a> may increase as storms strengthen.<br/><br/><a href="https://abc7.com/travel/thanksgiving-travel-rush-likely-to-shatter-records/5694761/"><b>RELATED: TSA says 26M passengers expected for 'record-breaking' Thanksgiving holiday travel</b></a><br/><br/>That same storm will then move toward parts of California and the Southwest, and then to the South Central states by the end of the week.</p>
