      <p>The <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> 246 card, which is heavily rumored to be headlined by Conor McGregor's return fight against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/donald-cowboy-cerrone">Donald Cerrone</a>, is slowly yet steadily shaping up to be a solid event to kick off the new year.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/22/20978133/aleksei-oleinik-vs-maurice-greene-in-the-works-for-ufc-246">per</a> MMAFighting, the promotion is planning to have a heavyweight fight between <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/3-best-fights-of-aleksei-oleinik-ss">Aleksei Oleinik</a> (57-13-1) and Maurice Greene (8-3) at the show.</p>
      <p>Oleinik last fought in July 2019 and lost to Walt Harris via KO. The 42-year-old veteran suffered two consecutive losses this year and is on the lookout for a big win that can get his UFC career back on track.</p>
      <p>Oleinik will face former Ultimate Fighter Contender Maurice Greene, who is coming off a TKO loss against Sergei Pavlovich.</p>
      <p>Both the heavyweights need to get back into the winner's column and that serves as the perfect hook to build this fight up.</p>
      <p>UFC 246 will also see Maycee Barber take on Roxanne Modafferi in a Women's Flyweight contest. Nasrat Haqparast and Drew Dober will meet inside the Octagon for a Lightweight bout while Grant Dawson and Chas Skelly are slated to face each other in a Featherweight fight.</p>
      <p>The UFC is currently negotiating the highly-anticipated showdown between Donald Cerrone and Conor McGregor and an official announcement regarding the same should increase the hype surrounding the event, which is scheduled to take place on January 18th at the T-Mobile Arena.</p>
