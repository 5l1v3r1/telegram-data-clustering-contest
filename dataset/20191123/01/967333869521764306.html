      <h1>UK Farm Helper Ends Up Covered in Manure After Losing Footing</h1>
      <h2>Molly Wise, a resident of Chelmsford, Essex, recently learned that it’s not all fun and games when working on the farm - especially when you’re transporting manure in a wheelbarrow.</h2>

      <p>Cellphone footage, which was filmed by Linda Wise, shows her daughter Molly getting off to a struggling start during her first attempt to push the manure-filled wheelbarrow to the designated location; however, disaster strikes for the farm hand when she loses her footing and winds up face down, with loads of manure all over her upper body.</p>
      <p>It’s safe to say this will be a memory to look back on for the pair, and maybe a lesson for the future.</p>
