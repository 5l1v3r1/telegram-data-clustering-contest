      <p>Surely I can't be the only one?</p>
      <p>I'm really hoping I haven't caught a dose of the Bah Humbug this year and hope some others might be feeling the same.</p>
      <p>With December edging ever closer, it's not surprising that Christmas has begun to sneak its way into everyday life.</p>
      <p>From the erection of Christmas trees in some enthusiastic homes and the playing of familiar festive tunes in shops, to the arrival of the man in the big red suit at shopping centres, December 25 is most certainly on its way.</p>
      <p>Of course, the one fail safe way of knowing that Christmas is just around the corner is the arrival of festive adverts on tv.</p>
      <p>Every year in the middle of November, each of them make an appearance, attempting to tug on the heart strings and win the coveted title of best Christmas advert.</p>
      <p>But to be honest, I'm not that impressed so far.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, everyone was holding their breaths in anticipation of the new John Lewis ad which introduced us to accident-prone dragon, Edgar who feared his fire breathing would spoil Christmas.</p>
      <p>Like many others, I was excited to see the ad but have been left feeling deflated because I don't particularly like it.</p>
      <p>It didn't leave me feeling Christmasy or warm and fuzzy and I didn't really feel for Edgar - sorry.</p>
      <p>And, to be honest, I don't think it's a great year for Christmas ads generally.</p>
      <p>The Walkers advert featuring Mariah Carey is just a head melt.</p>
      <p>Too much diva and not enough festivity for me.</p>
      <p>The M&amp;S ad featuring people dancing around in scarily bad Christmas jumpers to Jump Around by House of Pain is just lost on me while the Sainsburys ad telling the tale of the origins of Father Christmas and how he was helped to find his true calling with the help of Mary Ann Sainsbury is just a bit long-winded.</p>
      <p>If I did have to pick one, it would be the offering from Dog's Trust, even though I am not an animal person at all.</p>
      <p>The ad introduces us to a dog fashioned out of cork, who steals a family's heart on Christmas day. However, when the festivities are over, with the rest of the rubbish, he is chucked out and abandoned.</p>
      <p>He then turns into a real dog before he is rescued by Dog's Trust as `Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas' sang by Sam Smith plays.</p>
      <p>I found this advert really touching and liked that it had a real message - think about the gifts you buy before you buy them.</p>
      <p>That said, whether this year's ads will have any influence on shoppers remains to be seen.</p>
      <p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>Fans of nineties sitcom, Fraiser are celebrating the news that the show is to get a reboot.</p>
      <p>The Emmy-award winning comedy, about Seattle-based radio psychiatrist Dr Frasier Crane, could be back on our screens next Summer.</p>
      <p>However, the star of show, Kelsey Grammar has warned that the new series will be a departure from what viewers were familiar with suggestions Fraiser could be in a different job and may be living in Chicago.</p>
      <p>And, we're told our favourite doctor could still be searching for love.</p>
      <p>Sounds good Kelsey.</p>
      <p>Us loyal fans are on board.</p>
