      <p>ISTANBUL (AP) — A car bomb exploded in a northern Syrian town along the border with Turkey on Saturday killing at least 3 people, Turkey’s Defense Ministry said.</p>
      <p>The ministry said more than 20 people were injured in the explosion in an industrial zone of Tal Abyad. Turkish troops and Turkey-backed fighters captured the city from Kurdish-led fighters in October.</p>
      <p>The ministry blamed Syrian Kurdish fighters for the attack.</p>
      <p>Two other car bombs have hit Tal Abyad this month, killing at least 21 people.</p>
      <p>Turkey is seeking to expand its areas of influence in Syria’s north, pushing Kurdish fighters away from its borders. Ankara views those Kurdish fighters as terrorists for their links to a Kurdish insurgency inside Turkey.</p>
      <p>The same Kurdish fighters were the United States’ main partner in combating the Islamic State group in Syria.</p>
