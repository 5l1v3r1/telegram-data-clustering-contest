      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa likely to enter 2020 NFL Draft despite hip injury, report says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:01:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's future was thrown into uncertainty when he suffered a <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/tua-tagovailoa-hip-injury-alabama-season/1xchsqsp61s481rdol2xfvjeis">season-ending hip dislocation</a> against Mississippi State last week.A report Friday tried to offer clarity.<a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/tua-tagovailoa-likely-to-enter-the-2020-nfl-draft/">According to</a>Pro Football Network NFL Draft analyst Tony Pauline,Tagovailoa intends to enter the 2020 draft rather than return to college for his senior year.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was a Heisman Trophy candidate and almost certainly a first-round draft pick until he was carted off the field in Starkville. He <a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/tua-tagovailoa-injury-update-hip-surgery/zwns6ztxt1m81n2o72pyzr5yl">underwent surgery Monday</a>to repair the injury. Pauline reported that Tagovailoa won't return to Alabama to try to get his draft stock back up.</p>

        <b>AL-KHATEEB: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/nick-saban-mistake-tua-tagovalioa-play-alabama-punishment-enough/3pdsx88dj7ww1baktxycyu7vf">Don't blame Nick Saban for Tua's injury</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>If Tagovailoa does slide down the draft board in April, he won't receive any insurance money to make up for the lost earnings, according to a<a href="https://www.actionnetwork.com/ncaaf/tua-tagovailoa-injury-alabama-nfl-draft-fall-insurance-loss-of-value">report</a> from The Action Network's Darren Rovell.</p>
      <p>Alabama's insurance policy for Tagovailoa covers only "permanent total disability," which means if Tagovailoa had suffered an injury that would have prevented him from pursuing a professional career entirely, Rovell reported. Because Tagovailoa is expected to recover from the hip injury, the coveragedoesn't apply.</p>
      <p>In addition to total disability insurance, some schools insure high-profile players with "loss-of-value" policies, which would apply to Tagovailoa. Additionally, players can pay for loss-of-value insurance themselves, but Tagovailoa had not done so.</p>
      <p>“I could not imagine a better partner than The University of Alabama throughout this situation," Tagovailoa's father, Galu Tagovailoa, said in a statement to The Action Network. “We had numerous discussions regarding insurance coverage, and we have been very comfortable with how Alabama has worked with our family at every turn."</p>
      <p>Alabama, Rovell reported, hasn't taken out a loss-of-value policy for any player "in recent memory."</p>
