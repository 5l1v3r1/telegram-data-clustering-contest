      <p>BELFAST city centre is primed for further growth and investment in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) market, according to a Centra franchise owner.</p>
      <p>Ricky and Vicky Leathem have invested £1.5 million across their four stores since starting the business in 2007.</p>
      <p>And having recently switched their banking to Danske Bank, they say they now able to facilitate further growth in the retail market, with the bank providing working capital requirements and a £150,000 loan to refurbish their new Bradbury Place store.</p>
      <p>Ricky Leathem said: “Belfast city centre has an opportunity to grow its FMCG market in line with a number of new office spaces coming to market. There are more people working and living in the centre and that is one of the main reasons we opened a new store at Bradbury Place.</p>
      <p>“Our new store differs from our other three as it has a sit in area and a different retail offering. We created 17 new jobs when we opened a few weeks ago and that number will increase as the store becomes busier. I always have an eye on potential sites for new stores. If it makes sense as a business decision, we'll consider it.”</p>
      <p>He added: “The challenge is that the price of food is always rising and there is still so much uncertainty over Brexit. The FMCG market is reliant on strong economic growth – the more money consumers have to spend, the more retailers benefit.”</p>
      <p>Michelle Wilson, business manager at Danske Bank, said: “Ricky and Vicky are ambitious owners with a wealth of experience in the retail market. By closely following consumer trends, they have adapted their offering to meet the demands of an ever-changing sector.</p>
      <p>“We are proud to support locally-owned family businesses and provide them with the right resources to grow.”</p>
