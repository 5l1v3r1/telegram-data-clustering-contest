      <h2>In this week's Blood Red, Paul Gorst says Liverpool fans are living through the FSG grand vision here and now</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T01:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/paul-gorst/" target="_blank">Paul Gorst</a></address>
      <p>There's not a part of Liverpool Football Club that isn't poised for the next step right now.</p>
      <p>On the pitch, things have rarely been as good in the Premier League era. The European champions currently have an eight-point lead at the summit having won 11 of their first dozen games of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-premier-league-man-city-17234311">Vanquishing Manchester City at Anfield</a> before the international break meant Jurgen Klopp's Champions League holders have now lost just one of their last 50 games, domestically. An astonishing run of form.</p>
      <p>Within the next month, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> will have the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/meet-two-south-american-giants-17297592">chance to become world champions</a> when they head to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/echo-visited-qatari-labour-camp-17292766">Qatar for the FIFA Club World Cup</a>. It is the only title that has eluded the club in all its glorious, trophy-laden history. <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-champions-league-final-tottenham-16366372">Klopp's European kings</a> will be heavy favourites when they enter at the semi-final stage.</p>
      <p>Their playing squad is the envy of virtually all of Europe, with a host of big-name, international superstars tied down to lengthy deals at Anfield, surely making ambitious raids from some of Europe's predators a prohibitive idea.</p>
      <p>Top stars like Alisson Becker, Virgil van Dijk, Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino all appear settled and content with Liverpool life. A world-class spine that is unlikely to be adversely altered any time soon.</p>
      <p>A nine-point gap between the leaders and champions Manchester City makes for happy reading for Liverpool fans as they prepare for a period that will see their team play 12 games before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>A first league title since 1990 remains firmly in sight and it is the Reds' to lose at the minute.</p>
      <p>Away from the football, the club's is thriving and well situated to make giant strides elsewhere. A brand new, five-year kit contract with Nike will be officially announced before the end of the season following Liverpool's victory in the High Court over New Balance.</p>

      <p>Designs on next season's kit were drawn up and finalised before the October court case as the world's biggest sportswear company spent nearly £6m on fabric for the would-be strips of 2020/21.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have already received pre-orders from around 8,000 stores and the company have also reserved factory space for 2.9m units with training designs agreed between the parties.</p>
      <p>That far exceeded their initial promise of around 6,000 stores and Liverpool were keen to secure a deal that centred around wider distribution across the globe.</p>
      <p>The agreement with the American brand will place Liverpool in a new realm when it comes to profiting on its on-field success of both the club and the players.</p>
      <p>Over the next five years, the Reds' visibility and brand on a global scale will reach levels never before seen at Anfield. It was a key reason why Liverpool were keen to get in-league with Nike.</p>
      <p>Expansive and ambitious designs for the Reds' new £50million training base in Kirkby continue at pace. Liverpool remain on schedule and within budget to open the complex before the start of next season.</p>
      <p>Klopp and his players will report to the base in July for pre-season after the club have waved an emotional goodbye to their current training ground, the iconic Melwood in West Derby.</p>
      <p>Liverpool, privately, feel the new training ground - one that will incorporate all age groups on the same site for the first time - will be an elite facility to rival any other in European football.</p>
      <p>While the move from Melwood will be a bittersweet affair, there are no plans, however, to relocate from Anfield as club owners Fenway Sport Group continue to work behind the scenes to expand one of world football's true cathedrals.</p>
      <p>Even with the Main Stand's legacy moving Anfield's capacity to just over 54,000, the Reds are still some way behind where they would like to be, capacity-wise.</p>
      <p>Public consultation is underway with 5000 leaflets being distributed to residents who live around the area to gather feedback on the proposed expansion on the Reds' stadium.</p>
      <p>The first consultation will take place on Friday November 29 with a web portal with further information to be published online prior to the event.</p>
      <p>FSG have are plotting to push Anfield's capacity through the 60,000 barrier and plans are now firmly underway to start that process.</p>
      <p>Matchday income, aided by the Main Stand since it was unveiled in September 2016, have nearly doubled to £81m over the years between 2011 and 2018. It has helped the club become more competitive on the pitch, but plans are afoot for that figure to crash through the £100m mark.</p>
      <p>It may have taken <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/liverpool-fsg-transfers-spending-klopp-17296550">the best part of 10 years</a>, but Liverpool fans are living through the FSG grand vision here and now.</p>
