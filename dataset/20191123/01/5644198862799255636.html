      <p>LA PAZ: Bolivia's interim government on Friday (Nov 22) filed a lawsuit accusing Evo Morales of "sedition and terrorism" after the ex-president called on supporters to maintain blockades in the crisis-hit country.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Arturo Murillo filed the complaint with federal prosecutors in La Paz, which has been choked by road blocks for weeks, causing food and fuel shortages in the capital.</p>

      <p>"We are seeking the maximum penalty for sedition and terrorism," Murillo told reporters after launching legal action against Morales.</p>
      <p>If Morales - who fled to Mexico after resigning on Nov 10 - were charged and convicted, he would face a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail.</p>
      <p>The legal action against Morales - who was Bolivia's first indigenous president -Â comes as Congress debates when to hold new elections that are seen as crucial to quelling weeks of unrest that erupted after the disputed October 20 ballot.</p>
      <p>Morales, who had been seeking a fourth term, claimed he won the vote, but opposition groups said it was rigged.</p>
      <p>A poll audit by the Washington-based Organization of American States, found irregularities in the results.</p>
      <p>At least 32 people have been killed in violence since the election, including 17 in clashes with security forces as anti-government protesters block main roads.</p>

        <b>"LET US GOVERN"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Morales has accused Bolivian security forces of engaging in "genocide" against his indigenous supporters, and called for action by the international community.</p>
      <p>The legal action comes after Murillo played a telephone recording to journalists on Wednesday, allegedly of Morales issuing instructions to a leader of the opposition movement in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>"Don't let food into the cities, we're going to block, really encircle (the cities)," says the voice Murillo attributed to Morales.</p>
      <p>Bolivia has lodged a formal protest to Mexico over Morales' remarks, saying they "contravened" his political asylum status, the foreign ministry said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Morales, who claims to have been a victim of a coup after losing the support of the security forces, tweeted Thursday that the caretaker government's efforts to prosecute him were a "farce."</p>
      <p>Attorney General Juan Lanchipa said Friday he would ask the foreign ministry to "inform Mexican authorities of the beginning of the investigation" involving Morales.</p>
      <p>Interim President Jeanine Anez on Friday called on anti-government protesters to "let us govern" and lift the road blocks around La Paz.</p>
      <p>Her remarks come a day after police tear gassed indigenous protesters who marched on the city with the coffins of five of the eight people killed in clashes at a key fuel plant Tuesday.</p>
