      <p>A reader details how six weeks off with an injured leg led to him playing Sonic Mania, Cuphead, Celeste, and Return Of The Obra Dinn.</p>
      <p>It’s been a strange time for me, given I ruptured my Achilles tendon and have been off work for six weeks. I bought some games. It was time to try Sonic Mania, which I struggled with due to dying, running out of continues and… needing to restart from the beginning? But I persevered and remembered that’s how things used to go, watching traps move and learning patterns of attack. I set multitudes of enslaved animals free and enjoyed it then on those terms.</p>
      <p>Cuphead. A lot’s been said about Cuphead already but the impression I’m left with after an arduous few weeks’ play and finally sinking the Devil, is it’s simply the most well-realised and executed expression of any developer’s vision ever coded. I’d like to shake their white-gloved hands; throughout its duration I was stupefied by character and level design. Thank you.</p>

      <p>Next I played Celeste. To say I persevered with this isn’t being fair, as I did enjoy the puzzle elements and found it satisfying plotting Madeline’s progression along each of the spike-lined screens. Coming after Cuphead, though, in my recovery from injury, I don’t think it made the impact it otherwise likely would have. You die thousands of times, yet it felt like a Jet Set Willy I might possibly complete, and the dialogue, pacing, and music helped set its ‘quietly determined’ tone. I didn’t ruin that by spending too much time on the masochistic extra levels.</p>
      <p>I’ve told my boss to expect me back on Monday. That doesn’t give me long to finish Return Of The Obra Dinn. For a few days there I didn’t boot it up, as I’d no idea what was going on and had turned up all these death scenes that made no sense whatsoever, getting more and more lost in the timeline.</p>
      <p>I then made some intuitions and determined the fates of a few of the crew. I’m utterly struck by the visuals so am content to, if entirely stuck, wander the decks of this ghost ship, viewing the horrors aboard. But now I am hooked. How to solve the mystery here is not at all clear, making for a true challenge. Not one I am sure to accomplish, though if I do I’ll be rewarded.</p>
