        <b>New Indie</b>
      </p>
      <p>Don’t feel bad if you missed one of 2018’s best films on the big screen: with its four-hour running time (two parts at two hours each) and city-by-city distribution schedule, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bread-Factory-Blu-ray-Tyne-Daly/dp/B07SN8V7MY/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“A Bread Factory”</b></a> (Grasshopper Film) traveled under many viewers’ radars. Now that it’s finally on Blu-ray, however, you can carve out the time for this delicately brilliant comedy-drama about a small town in upstate New York and the community arts center operating out of the titular building. Writer-director Patrick Wang uses his real estate to tie together various plots and storylines among the town’s citizens and the visiting artists, and he gets the most out of an exceptional ensemble that includes Tyne Daly, Glynnis O’Connor and Janeane Garofalo. (The latter plays an exasperated film director in one of the funniest Q&amp;A scenes I’ve ever seen.) Get this one for your collection, and don’t be put off by the length — you’ll want to savor it more than once.</p>
      <p>Also available: The Shia LaBeouf-issance of 2019 includes his charming turn in the rambling road comedy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peanut-Butter-Falcon-Blu-ray/dp/B07Y9BGNSP?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“The Peanut Butter Falcon”</b></a> (Lionsgate); if you like “Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,” then check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ophelia-Blu-ray-Daisy-Ridley/dp/B07W6CBJG1/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Ophelia”</b></a> (IFC/Shout Factory), based on the YA novel that gives Hamlet’s <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/ophelia-film-review-daisy-ridley-naomi-watts/">beloved</a> (played here by Daisy Ridley) an even break; believe the hype — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Farewell-Blu-ray-Lulu-Wang/dp/B07VRFVFHP/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“The Farewell”</b></a> (Lionsgate) is one of the year’s best films; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/After-Wedding-Blu-Ray-Blu-ray/dp/B07YTCDZF8/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“After the Wedding”</b></a> (Sony Pictures Home Entertainment), an acclaimed remake of Susanne Bier’s film, features a memorable clash between Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If you’re going to make a docudrama about a legendary surrealist, why not make it an animated film? Festival smash <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bu%C3%B1uel-Labyrinth-Turtles-Blu-ray-Jorge/dp/B07XN1JDBN/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles”</b></a> (Shout Factory/GKIDS) follows the life of legendary Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, reeling from the financial disaster of the scandalous “L’Age d’Or” and moving on to make the documentary “Las Hurdes,” about some of Spain’s poorest peasants.

        <b>New Documentary</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corporate-Coup-dEtat-Chris-Hedges/dp/B07XLQ18Z3/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“The Corporate Coup d’État”</b></a> (First Run Features) is the kind of horror movie I watch through splayed fingers, an examination of where we are and how we got here. The film follows the decades-long path of how corporations and billionaires took over the political process and crushed the American workforce, and while it’s not a tale for the faint of heart, it’s essential viewing for voters and anyone else who cares about how we dig ourselves out of this hole.</p>
      <p>Also available: The Ganga-Longoba people of Cuba have a long-awaited reunion with their relatives in Sierra Leone in the one-of-a-kind <a href="https://www.amazon.com/They-Are-We-Joe-Allie/dp/B07Y4HY545/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“They Are We”</b></a> (Icarus Films); one of this year’s most talked-about docs, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FRONTLINE-Sama-DVD-n/dp/B07XW7G4T8/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“For Sama”</b></a> (PBS) gives viewers a painfully intimate look at five years of the conflict in Syria; visit Park Slope’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Coop-Thomas-Boothe/dp/B07XR966T2/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Food Coop”</b></a> (Bullfrog Films), one of many such collective grocery stores that are gaining in popularity around the country; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scared-Revolution-Umar-Bin-Hassan/dp/B07Y1ZSVGK/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Scared of Revolution”</b></a> (Film Movement) profiles poet Umar Bin Hassan, who became a key influence on subsequent generations of hip-hop artists.</p>

        <b>New Grindhouse</b>
      </p>
      <p>So here’s a movie that never really got a fighting chance: 2011’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thing-Blu-ray-Mary-Elizabeth-Winstead/dp/B07VTHFRPY/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“The Thing”</b></a> (Mill Creek Entertainment), a prequel to the John Carpenter cult hit (which was, itself, a remake). So vaguely marketed that people weren’t sure if it was a remake or what — and this contemporary habit of giving multiple movies the exact same title (e.g. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shaft-Collection-Shafts-Score-Africa/dp/B000KG4BD6?tag=alonsoduralde-20">“Shaft,”</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shaft-Blu-ray-Samuel-L-Jackson/dp/6317815208/?tag=alonsoduralde-20">“Shaft”</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shaft-Blu-ray-Digital-Combo-Pack/dp/B07RX2JZRW/?tag=alonsoduralde-20">“Shaft”</a>) didn’t help — audiences mostly stayed away, assuming that the Carpenter movie is unassailable. And while it absolutely is, that doesn’t mean that this prequel doesn’t offer its own share of frozen chills and entertainingly hard-bitten performances (particularly from Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Try watching this one on its own terms, and you might be pleasantly surprised.</p>
      <p>Also available: Don’t let the subtitles fool you — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quake-Wave-Blu-ray-Kristoffer-Joner/dp/B07X5FQFHF/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“The Wave” &amp; “The Quake”</b></a> (Magnolia Home Entertainment) are thrilling natural-disaster thrillers that Irwin Allen would have loved; if Tarantino’s latest has clued you in to the greatness of Sharon Tate, check her out in the horror-comedy classic <a href="https://www.wbshop.com/products/the-fearless-vampire-killers-bd"><b>“The Fearless Vampire Killers”</b></a> (Warner Archive Collection); <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dry-Blood-Blu-Ray-Clint-Carney/dp/B07L6SNPBQ/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Dry Blood”</b></a> (Epic Pictures) asks, What if you’re suffering from drug withdrawal AND there are ghosts and a plot to kill you?; genre title <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tattoo-Revenge-Diana-Lein/dp/B07WLBQPG3/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Tattoo of Revenge”</b></a> (Breaking Glass) comes from an unlikely source: Mexican auteur Julián Hernández, best known for dreamy arthouse films like “A Thousand Clouds of Peace.”</p>
      <p>Before the recent big-screen remake came the genuinely creepy made-for-TV movie <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Afraid-Dark-Bluray-Blu-ray/dp/B07Y1VXB47/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark”</b></a> (Warner Archive Collection); legendary stinker <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eegah-Blu-Ray-Arch-Hall-Jr/dp/B07YTCP78B/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Eegah!”</b></a> (The Film Detective) never looked better — it got a 4K restoration — and this new edition features interviews with Joel Hodgson and the film’s star, Arch Hall, Jr.; and speaking of 4K, if you’ve got the souped-up home entertainment system, you can enjoy the sharp new releases of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Soldier-artisan-Blu-ray-Emmerich/dp/B07Y98NLM8/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Universal Soldier”</b></a> (Lionsgate) and Dario Argento’s original, superior <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Suspiria-4K-Ultra-HD-Blu-ray/dp/B07XQRHW61/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Suspiria”</b></a> (Synapse Films).</p>
      <p>Logan Miller (“Escape Room,” “Take Me to the River”) stars in Blumhouse’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Prey-Logan-Miller/dp/B07X4BNR8N/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Prey”</b></a> (Cinedigm); a lady disappears from the back seat of a cab in <a href="https://epic-pictures.com/merchandise/the-fare-blu-ray"><b>“The Fare”</b></a> (DREAD), and that’s just the beginning of a chilling, wild ride; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hitch-Hike-Blu-ray-Robert-Gribbin/dp/B07X5G2VPB/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Hitchhike to Hell”</b></a> (Arrow Video) follows a creepy killer with an eye for nubile young women looking for rides.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/47-Meters-Down-Uncaged-Blu-ray/dp/B07Y9D3XLY/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“47 Meters Down: Uncaged”</b></a> (Lionsgate) assembles new sharks and new chums in a film that will test your claustrophobia; Peter Cushing’s antique store is the focal point for four tales of terror in the 1974 all-star anthology <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Grave-Blu-ray-Robin-Clarke/dp/B07Y1XYKBK/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“From Beyond the Grave”</b></a> (Warner Archive Collection); Gary Oldman and Emily Mortimer set sail on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Blu-ray-Gary-Oldman/dp/B07W8LJNQQ/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Mary”</b></a> (RLJE Films) which is, unfortunately for them, a quite haunted ship.</p>
      <p>Indie film legend Bob Shaye directs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ambition-Blu-ray-Katherine-Hughes/dp/B07W6CF53G/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Ambition”</b></a> (Scream Factory), about a musician losing her grip as her rivals begin to get killed off; noir meets sci-fi in cult favorite <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yesterday-Was-Blu-ray-Kipleigh-Brown/dp/B07TKNFR7H/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Yesterday Was a Lie”</b></a> (IndiePix Films), celebrating its 10th anniversary; Sammo Hung directs Jackie Chan in the martial arts extravaganza <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-Nice-Blu-ray-Karen-McLymont/dp/B07Y1XYKCJ/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Mr. Nice Guy”</b></a> (Warner Archive Collection), featured here in the “Extended Cut.”</p>

      <p>
        <b>New Classic</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Criterion Collection offers up two of Bette Davis’ finest screen performances: in 1942’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Now-Voyager-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B07WFXGNY1/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Now, Voyager”</b></a> — one of the greatest melodramas Hollywood ever made — she blossoms from neurotic shut-in to glamorous woman of the world, falling in love along the way with Paul Henreid. (This is the movie where he famously lights two cigarettes and hands her one — sexy stuff, no matter what you feel about smoking.) And of course, her portrayal of aging Broadway legend Margo Channing in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-About-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B07WDS19YB/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“All About Eve”</b></a> is the stuff legends are made of. (And if you’re worried about how Disney is going to be handling the Fox library, all the more reason to have a physical copy of this classic in your permanent library.)</p>
      <p>Also available: Hard to find for many years, Mark Rappaport’s provocative, essential documentaries <a href="https://www.gartenbergmedia.com/dvd-distribution-and-sales/experimental-narratives-avant-garde-shorts/from-the-journals-of-jean-seberg"><b>“From the Journals of Jean Seberg”</b></a> and <a href="https://www.gartenbergmedia.com/dvd-distribution-and-sales/experimental-narratives-avant-garde-shorts/rock-hudsons-home-movies"><b>“Rock Hudson’s Home Movies”</b></a> (both Gartenberg Media) are now available on region-free DVDs, and the former is must viewing now that the biopic “Seberg” is hitting theaters; Roger Vadim takes a crack at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liaisons-Dangereuses-Blu-ray-Jeanne-Moreau/dp/B07XQXW25B/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Les Liaisons Dangereuses”</b></a> (Kino Classics), featuring a delicious early performance from Jeanne Moreau; he gets better with age, but Frank Langella was already pretty great when he was young, playing a very sexy, very dangerous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Blu-ray-Frank-Langella/dp/B07WNZR4X1/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Dracula”</b></a> (Scream Factory).</p>

      <p>Walter Matthau and director Don Siegel pack a lethal punch in the heist flick <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charley-Varrick-Special-Blu-ray-Matthau/dp/B07X5FPP7N/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Charley Varrick”</b></a> (Kino Lorber Studio Classics); it’s time for a 40-year reunion with The Ramones and the kids at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rock-Roll-High-School-Blu-ray/dp/B07W47FRXK/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Rock ‘n’ Roll High School”</b></a> (Shout Factory), with a steelbook edition that features a new 4K scan of the cult epic; one of the very few films to present a same-sex relationship in any kind of light, let alone a positive one, in 1951, the French import <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Olivia-Blu-ray-Edwige-Feuill%C3%A8re/dp/B07Y9B1MWZ/?tag=alonsoduralde-20"><b>“Olivia”</b></a> (Icarus Films) occupies a singular space in LGBTQ cinema history.</p>
