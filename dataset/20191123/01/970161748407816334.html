      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/miley-cyrus/">Miley Cyrus</a> and Cody Simpson may have been at the centre of split rumours recently, but the pair are reportedly very much still together.</p>
      <p>So much so, that insiders have described the pair’s relationship as ‘very easy’ and insisted that the pair are happy spending periods away from each other and living ‘separate lives’.</p>
      <p>A source told <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/">People</a> magazine: ‘Miley and Cody have their separate lives. Cody had to stay in LA but has visited Miley in Tennessee (where she is recovering from vocal surgery).’</p>
      <p>‘They have a very easy relationship,’ the source added. ‘They see each other when they can and when they are apart, things are good too. This works for both of them.’</p>
      <p>That might explain why there hasn’t been as many PDA-posts from the couple on Instagram, lately.</p>

      <p>The Wrecking Ball singer and Cody had initially paraded their new romance on social media, after getting together shortly after her split from ex Kaitlynn Carter, but found themselves <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-month-hot-heavy-dating-11179089/">hit by split claims following their lack of activity on social media. </a></p>

      <p>Insiders claimed earlier this month that the pair’s relationship had ‘cooled off’ and Miley and Cody were taking a ‘break’, as Miley had decided to ‘focus on herself’.</p>
      <p>Sources alleged that Miley’s loved-up posts with Cody had been all part of a plan to get a rise out of her ex husband Liam Hemsworth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/11/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-split-less-year-marriage-love-officially-dead-10551978/">Miley and Liam announced their decision to separate in August</a> after a decade of dating on and off and just eight months of marriage.</p>
      <p>However, reports shut down such claims and insisted Miley and Cody were still very much together – her working commitments had meant they haven’t been able to see each other as much in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>‘They are very happy together. She has a new house in LA and when she’s in town, she has been spending most nights there,’ a source said.</p>
      <p>‘She was out of town and they definitely missed each other. They reunited and you could see how happy they were to be back together again. It’s clear they are very into each other.’</p>
