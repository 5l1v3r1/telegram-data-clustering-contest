      <p>Liam Gallagher has piled on to his feud with brother Noel, branding him a ‘big bully’.</p>
      <p>So that Oasis reunion isn’t on the way anytime soon…</p>
      <p>It all kicked off between the Wonderwall singers when Noel, 52, appeared on Radio X with Zane Lowe, where he was asked <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/liam-gallaghers-twitter-account-dont-oasis-reunion-according-noel-11173452/">about the praise Liam had heaped on him</a>.</p>
      <p>Not mincing his words, he told the host: ‘That doesn’t mean s**t to me. Because he’s on Twitter probably right now saying the exact opposite so it doesn’t mean anything.</p>
      <p>‘In here on camera, playing to the gallery, fine, good. But when it f**king matters, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/liam-gallagher-tells-noels-wife-grow-hits-back-social-media-claims-11184193/">he’s abusing my wife and my kids</a>.</p>
      <p>‘It’s like no, no, no, you don’t get to f**king do both. Either be a c*** and own it or don’t be a c***.’</p>

      <p>‘When I eventually see him, he’ll realise it’s not f**king banter.’</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, Liam, 47, wasn’t too impressed with his brother’s rant, and promptly let rip.</p>
      <p>Responding to a fan’s post of the video on Twitter, the Beady Eye star hit back: ‘Noel Kevin Keegan Gallagher is the funniest thing I’ve seen or heard in over a decade the gift that keeps on giving LG x.</p>
      <p>‘I’m scared I’m seriously upping my security so many people out there wanting to cause me harm HELP ME</p>
      <p>‘There all BIG BULLYS (sic).’</p>

      <p>Noel previously lifted the lid on his relationship with his former bandmate, admitting that every message he shares on social media is a ‘nail in the coffin’ of a potential revival of the Lyla singers.</p>
      <p>In a candid chat with the Big Issue, he admitted: ‘It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it.</p>
      <p>‘He’d put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together. But every tweet he sends out it’s another nail in the coffin of that idea.’</p>

      <p>Addressing his brother directly, he added: ‘If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are f**king more of a moron than you look.’</p>
      <p>Can’t we all just get along?</p>
