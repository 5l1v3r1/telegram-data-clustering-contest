      <p>In the aftermath of a Naxal attack on policemen in Jharkhand, the Election Commission on Friday appointed former IPS officer M K Das as special police observer for the assembly polls in the state, according to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora.</p>
      <p>He said Das will reach Jharkhand on Saturday to take up his new responsibility.</p>
      <p>"Former IPS officer M K Das has been appointed as special police observer for Jharkhand," Arora told PTI.</p>
      <p>Three police personnel, including a sub-inspector, were killed in a Naxal attack in Latehar district of Jharkhand on Friday. The attack by armed insurgents happened about 8:30 pm when the police party was on patrol duty.</p>
      <p>Deputy Election Commissioner Sudeep Jain said Das, a former director general of Manipur Police, was deployed as a special observer for Tripura and Mizoram in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p>
