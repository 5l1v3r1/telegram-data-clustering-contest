      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-friday-headphones-deals-how-and-where-to-find-the-biggest-bargains">Black Friday</a> might be days away but the sales have started now. </p>
      <p>These Marshall Monitor <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-best-wireless-headphones-you-can-buy-right-now">wireless</a> <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/black-friday-headphones-deals-how-and-where-to-find-the-biggest-bargains">headphones</a> should be a consideration for any rock fan looking for a new pair of bluetooth headphones.  </p>
      <p>Marshall pretty much invented the modern rock sound back in the 60s, working directly with artists like <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-who-albums-ranked-from-worst-to-best">The Who</a>'s Pete Townshend or a young <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/john-mayall-s-bluesbreakers-and-the-making-of-the-beano">Eric Clapton</a>. Since then, their amps and cabs (aka speakers) have been the first port of call for every rock act worth their salt. The logo and black leatherette-with-gold look is iconic. </p>
      <p>But they haven't lasted more than 50 years based on looks alone. </p>

      <p>These Marshall Monitor over-ears are designed with the same stellar attention to detail as seen in Marshall's stage audio equipment, and they possess impressive sound capabilities: full-bodied, with deep lows, mids that shine and crystal highs. They're comfortable, give you 30 hours of performance and look the bollocks (technical term).</p>
