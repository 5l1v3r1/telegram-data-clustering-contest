      <p>If you're someone who is looking to shed those extra kilos, you'd be aware about certain fad diets that are doing rounds in the health and nutrition circuit lately. While most of these fad diets are said to show quick results, they tend to lose their essence with time and fail to provide the body with long-term benefits. To lose weight in an effective and efficient way, it gets imperative to eat a healthy and balanced diet along with following a dedicated work-out regimen. A combination of these two could help you go a long way in achieving your weight loss goals. </p>
      <p>To help you with the diet part, we bring to you an easy-to-make weight-loss-friendly recipe that is a perfect combo of taste and health. Wondering what it is? It's the 4-ingredient apple salad for weight loss. Apple is that one juicy and crunchy versatile fruit that you need to include in your diet today for its healthful benefits. According to the book, 'Healing Foods' by DK Publishing House, "Apples are high in fibre that boost metabolic levels, help improve heart health and even regulate body's blood sugar levels by regulating the release of sugar. The pectin fibre present in apples and antioxidant polyphenols reduce levels of unhealthy LDL cholesterol."</p>

      <p>Another healthy addition to this salad is that of <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/weight-loss-7-reasons-why-walnuts-must-be-included-in-diet-to-lose-extra-kilos-2047304">walnuts</a> and pine nuts, both of which are brimming with nutrition. Walnuts are an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acid or polyunsaturated fatty acid. Other than this, its high protein and fibre content helps facilitate weight loss. When it comes to <a href="https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/8-health-benefits-of-pine-nuts-chilgoza-the-nutty-winter-treat-1621360">pine nuts</a>, they are considered great for dieters; thanks to the presence of Pinolenic Acid. It is known to help stimulate the intestine to produce a particular hormone that signals the brain to turn off the 'hungry mode'. However, one must practice moderation as excess of anything could turn out to be bad for overall health.</p>
