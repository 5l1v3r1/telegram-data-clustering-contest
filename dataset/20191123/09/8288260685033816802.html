      <p>A school where pupils were forced to ‘hide under tables’ after has broken its silence after the lockdown caused panic.</p>
      <p>Stuart Bathurst Catholic High School and Sixth Form, off Wood Green Road, was locked down TWICE after reports of three intruders were announced on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police said no-one was located at the school at around lunchtime and were reviewing CCTV.</p>
      <p>No-one was hurt during the incident.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the school stated there was reports of three intruders – with the school being placed on lockdown twice.</p>
      <p>A statement from the school added: "In order to keep our students safe at all times Stuart Bathurst Catholic High School had to initiate two lockdown procedures. This followed reports of an intruder on site. The intruder had entered our site following a police incident in the local area and immediately left site.</p>
      <p>"Police were informed and attended quickly. The school initiated a lock down procedure as police informed us at this stage that there may be a second intruder on site.</p>
      <p>"The second intruder was apprehended by police immediately as she had been contained within our double layered security fencing. She had not gained full access to the school at any stage. We were given the all clear by policed and members of staff checked the area thoroughly to ensure there was no additional risks.</p>
      <p>"The second lockdown was initiated when there was a third intruder spotted on the roof of one of our buildings. Police once again attended site but the intruder had already left. At no stage were any of our young people put at risk and the school believes that this particular incident was not directed at students or staff.</p>
      <p>"Parents were kept informed according to National Safeguarding Procedures but due to the upsetting nature of the morning the school decided that it would be prudent to allow parents to collect their children early."</p>
      <p>A parent, who wished to remain anonymous, took to social media to ask what had happened shortly after the alert.</p>
      <p>They said: "No one knows what is going on. We can't get through to the school."</p>
      <p>While another added: "What's happening? Please can we have an update? Can we fetch our children?"</p>
      <p>Other parents at the school spoke of their worry after receiving the text, which alerted them to a lockdown.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: "Police were called to Stuart Bathurst School just after 12.15pm today after a man was seen on the roof.</p>
      <p>"The school initiated the lockdown procedure as a precaution and all pupils are safe. At no time was there any danger to anyone at the school.</p>
      <p>"No-one has been located, but officers are viewing CCTV."</p>
