      <p>Eastern Cape police are searching for five suspects following a business robbery in Joubertina at around 1:30 on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Captain Gerda Swart says it is alleged that two men arrived at a hospital pretending to be ill.</p>
      <p>She says they overpowered the security guard and tied him up, before going to the reception area where they overpowered the cashier and staff on duty.</p>
      <p>Swart says three more suspects then arrived, and they broke into the pharmacy and took an unknown amount of items, as well as cellphones and cash belonging to the staff.</p>
      <p>Swart says the suspects took the keys of two vehicles belonging to the Department of Health and fled the scene.</p>
      <p>Both vehicles were later found abandoned about 15 km outside Joubertina, in the direction of Port Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the nearest police station.</p>
      <p>The Eastern Cape Health Department has strongly condemned the robbery of a hospital.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Siswe Kupelo says when you have armed men coming into a public health facility to rob, it clearly shows that you have a problem at a societal level.</p>
      <p>"We can have as many security guards at hospitals, but if criminals have no shame to attack and rob their own institutions, it is a problem that must be addressed outside of the Department", he said.</p>
      <p>Kupelo says on Thursday night, criminals also robbed a clinic in Libode at gunpoint and stole a state vehicle.<br/><br/>He says the police were alerted but the car has not yet been recovered.</p>
