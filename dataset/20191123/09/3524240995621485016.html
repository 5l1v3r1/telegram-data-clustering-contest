      <p>American model Slick Woods has revealed via an Instagram post that she’s currently undergoing chemotherapy for stage three melanoma cancer.</p>
      <p>Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes.</p>
      <p>The cancer typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye, experts say.</p>

      <p>The 23-year-old bisexual model who is also an avid marijuana user, is mother to one-year-old son, Saphir, born to Ivorian-Canadian model, Adonis Bosso.</p>
      <p>She warns fans and supporters on Instagram not to treat her “like a victim.”</p>
      <p>Born Simone Thompson but given the alias “Slick Woods” by her friends, the model was raised by her grandmother while her mother served out a long prison term. Her mother was released February this year.</p>
      <p>Kanye West is credited with helping to launch Slick Woods’s career.</p>
      <p>She describes herself as “modern day Gia [Carangi] without the drugs.”</p>
      <p>In the Instagram post, Sleek sticks out her tongue, with her friends around her, and captioned it, “How I feel about chemotherapy, shout out to everyone that gotta go through it #AtLeastImAlreadyBald.”</p>
      <p>She said she was currently fighting for her life.</p>
