      <h1>Land values resilient as hotspots tempt buyers</h1>
      <h2>Farmland remains scarce and prices stable in Angus and Aberdeenshire – for now.</h2>

      <p>However, a leading land specialist has predicted the likelihood of a significant turnaround in land values and availability if post-Brexit agricultural support policies prove unpalatable to the farming industry.</p>
      <p>Savills rural director Rory Galloway outlined recent rural market trends to property professionals in Aberdeen, pointing to hotspots this summer such as class 2 arable land in Fife which sold at £16,000/acre and a block of bare grade 3(1) land in Angus making in excess of £14,000 at a competitive closing date.</p>
      <p>Mr Galloway said there was significant demand in specific hotspots, driven by the top quartile of farmers for whom expansion is the principal driver for purchase.</p>
      <p>He added: “However, buyers no longer hunger after additional acres at any cost.”</p>
      <p>Pointing out that the Scottish Government is still to reveal how farmers are to be supported post-2024, Mr Galloway said no matter what came “down the line”, he anticipated there would be a proportion of farmers who will not have the appetite for a fundamental change in policy, and that, in turn, would feed the supply chain.</p>
      <p>He added: “It is our expectation therefore that if supply increases significantly, the values of arable and grassland may come under pressure and we are likely to see land values soften.”</p>
      <p>Mr Galloway said only 21,000 acres of farmland were marketed publicly in Scotland in the first nine months of 2019, a decrease of 49% on last year.</p>
      <p>On average, prime arable acres are trading at £7,940/acre, an increase of 3.8% on 2018, while across Britain this quality of land saw values decrease by 0.5%.</p>
      <p>The Scottish estates market has also seen a reduction in supply, although there are currently 12 estates on the open market with a total asking price of £59 million.</p>
