      <h1>Aren't Hors d'Oeuvres Just Appetizers? Not Exactly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:40:03+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:40</time> by <a rel="author">Susannah Chen</a></address>
      <p>Finger foods, starters, appetizers, hors d'oeuvres. These terms are often used interchangeably, especially as we approach another season of holiday entertaining. But I've come to wonder: is there a difference between appetizers and hors d'oeuvres? Although both are meant to foster an appetite and they're <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appetizer">listed as the same thing</a> in Wikipedia, there is a subtle difference between the two courses.</p>
      <p>The French term <i>hors d'oeuvre</i> (pronounced "or-derves"), which literally means "out of work" but translates to "outside the meal," is a one-bite item that's either stationary or passed and served separate from or prior to a meal. An hors d'oeuvre is typically <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Finger-Food-Recipes-32763515">finger food</a> and might refer to, among other items, canapés, crudités, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/How-Chefs-Make-Deviled-Eggs-43397124">deviled eggs</a>, and bruschetta.</p>
      <p>Appetizers, on the other hand, appear as the first courses when seated at the table. They're often slightly larger and composed in a way that complements the entrée and dessert courses to follow. Which do you prefer — or is it all the same to you?</p>
