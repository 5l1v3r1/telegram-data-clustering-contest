      </p>
      <p>Arhaan Khan made more headlines than the others who have been evicted from Bigg Boss 13 so far, primarily because he then said that<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-would-you-like-to-see-arhaan-khan-back-on-the-show/5dd66ff287fb571eff7e437a"> he would love to return to the House and propose to Rashami Desai.</a>Â However, Arhaan did not create any impact and there has hardly been anyone rooting for his comeback.<br/><br/>Well, someone out there feels that whether Arhaan returns to Bigg Boss 13 or not, he will definitely propose to the Dil Se Dil Tak star. The man in question is the Nach Baliye 9 winner Arhaan's buddy Prince Narula, whose wedding in fact was the occasion where Rashami first met Arhaan. The two exchanged numbers, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>

      <p>Prince Narula adds that Arhaan is a very nice boy. We quickly asked him his take on a starlet Amrita's claims that Arhaan is fake and his real name is Mazhar Shaikh. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-arhaan-khan-s-identity-dubious-actress-amrita-dhanoa-claims-he-is-mazhar-shaikh-whom-she-was-about-to-marry/5dcc5f4087fb571eff7e3d52">Amrita Dhanoa had also told us in that BREAKING STORY</a> of our's that Rashami is being fooled by Arhaan. Prince Narula said, "I know nothing like that. To me, he has always been Arhaan."</p>
