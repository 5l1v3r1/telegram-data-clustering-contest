      <h1>Arsenal predicted line-up for Premier League fixture against Southampton</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal take on Southampton at the Emirates in the Premier League on Saturday, hoping to pick up their first win in the league since October 5</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:30:08+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is set to continue with a back three in Arsenal's Premier League clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday - but there isn't a place for Granit Xhaka in the starting XI.</p>
      <p>The Gunners played with three centre backs in their last three matches before the international break - a 1-1 Europa League draw with Vitoria and a 2-0 defeat to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in the league.</p>
      <p>But there were moments of promise in both those games defensively which has tempted under pressure Emery to avoid tinkering again.</p>
      <p>Rob Holding, David Luiz and Calum Chambers, all of which started versus the Foxes, are likely to be the trio entrusted to keep away the out of form Saints from Bernd Leno.</p>

      <p>Emery will probably hold Xhaka back from making his first appearance since his infamous bust-up with Arsenal fans during their draw with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month.</p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder took badly to Gunners supporters sarcastically cheering him as he was being substituted - as he gestured, cupped his ears, told fans to "f*** off", ripped off his shirt and stormed down the tunnel.</p>
      <p>Emery had opened up the possibility of a return, but that may-well come from the bench.</p>
      <p>“He has come back better, his mindset now is to help us, and to be closer to playing when we need him," Emery said at his press conference.</p>

      <p>“I spoke to him this morning and we had a very good conversation. He was training very well before the international break and he trained very well today.</p>
      <p>“My objective hasn't changed. I want him to come back, with him helping us and convincing every supporter of his commitment to us. His performances are going to be better and we are going to be proud of him in an  <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>  shirt. He will have a long future with us - that is my objective and I am going to work for that.</p>
      <p>“He feels that Arsenal are his team now. He wants to come back, to have the confidence of our supporters. We are going to decide when, but I think little by little we can help him to come back and to connect again with us and with our supporters.</p>
      <p>“I want to give him confidence, ensure that he is comfortable and can connect with our supporters perform well and be strong with them.”</p>
      <p>Dani Ceballos has been ruled out with a thigh injury but Sead Kolasinac will undergo a late fitness test to check whether he is fit to start.</p>
      <p>Lucas Torreira, Matteo Guendouzi and Mesut Ozil will run the midfield at the Emirates, with Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang leading the line.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Arsenal predicted XI:</b>
        <i>Leno, Holding, Luiz, Chambers, Bellerin, Torreira, Ozil, Guendouzi, Kolasinac, Lacazette, Aubameyang</i>
