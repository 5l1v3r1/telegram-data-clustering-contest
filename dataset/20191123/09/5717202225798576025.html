      <p>Paul Merson has explained his main problem with Jose Mourinho’s appointment as Tottenham manager is that he can only be a short-term fix.</p>
      <p>Spurs dismissed Mauricio Pochettino from his position during the international break, which came as a major surprise to many after a successful five-year spell.</p>
      <p>But his team have made a poor start to the campaign and unfortunately he was unable to win silverware during his time in charge.</p>
      <p>The North London club have turned to serial winner Mourinho to try turn the team’s season around and ultimately win trophies.</p>
      <p>Spurs currently sit 14th in the Premier League table and travel to West Ham on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Pundit Merson isn’t fully convinced with Mourinho’s arrival, as history suggests he won’t be a long-term option.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt he (Mourinho) is still a very good manager. But I still cannot believe that he is the new Tottenham boss,” <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/paul-merson-column-jose-mourinho-20938245">Merson wrote in the Daily Star.</a></p>
      <p>“I cannot see the plan behind this, it is simply a quick fix. Spurs have panicked because they are worried they won’t qualify for the Champions League next season.</p>
      <p>“There is no project, there is no plan – it’s simply get us in the Champions League because we have to balance the books. I just don’t know where this is going with Mourinho.”</p>

        <b>TBR’s View:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho may not be in it for the long run at Spurs, but he’s going to bring major experience to a group of players that just can’t quite get over the line to win trophies.</p>
      <p>Surely fans will be thrilled if he can win a couple of pieces of silverware during a brief stint in charge.</p>
      <p>It’s likely to be a big change from life under Pochettino, but the squad has looked lacklustre since losing the Champions League final last summer and the new appointment should re-energise everyone.</p>
