      <p>Former England batting coach Mark Ramprakash fears England risk wasting Jofra Archer’s natural talent if he is restricted to the role of enforcer in their new-look bowling attack.</p>
      <p>New Zealand assumed control of the first Test in Maunganui after a patient batting display saw them reach 394/6 at the close with an unbeaten 119 from BJ Watling anchoring their innings.</p>
      <p>The hosts established a 41-run after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-root/">Joe Root</a>’s side had wasted a commanding position earlier in the match having been 277/4 at one stage, before a familiar collapse.</p>
      <p>Archer, who shot to prominence during the summer following his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/world-cup/">World Cup</a> and Ashes heroics, remained wicketless from 30 overs on his first Test appearance abroad, failing to disrupt New Zealand’s batsmen with a barrage of short-pitched bowling.</p>
      <p>‘We have to be very careful with our expectations just because he has great natural ability and great natural pace,’ said Ramprakash reflecting on Archer’s toils.</p>

      <p>‘It doesn’t mean that at his very young age he’s going to turn up and get five wickets every time.</p>

      <p>‘We have to be very patient and understand he’s a young man who is learning even though he has great success at one-day tournaments.</p>
      <p>‘He had a tough day of Test cricket today he will have learned a lot about how to bowl in those conditions. How to physically understand his body and he’ll feel it in the morning.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got to be honest, he’s been used in the wrong way he’s not someone who just comes in and bowls loads of bouncers.</p>
      <p>‘I think he’s better than that. I want to see more balls at a fuller length. The great West Indian bowlers of the past, yes they’ve played the chin music but they’ve followed that up with really fast, accurate bowling.</p>
      <p>‘I think he’s better than what he showed today but I wonder if he’s being asked to play a role that’s not getting the best out of him.’</p>
