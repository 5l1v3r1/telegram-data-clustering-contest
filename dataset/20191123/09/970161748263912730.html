      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has revealed that he has already spoken to Dele Alli about improving his form for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>Alli made a swift impact after signing from MK Dons in 2015 with 32 goals in his first two seasons at Spurs.</p>
      <p>But the 23-year-old’s form has dipped, which prompted a pep talk from Mourinho after he replaced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> as Tottenham manager earlier this week.</p>
      <p>‘I have spoken with him and asked if he was Dele or Dele’s brother,’ said Mourinho.</p>

      <p>‘He told me he was Dele. ‘OK,’ I said, ‘play like Dele’. He is potentially a fantastic player.</p>
      <p>‘I have to create a tactical situation he is happy with, give him the right dynamics and prepare him physically because he has had important injuries and he is not on the top of his form.</p>

      <p>‘I cannot expect him to go to West Ham, if he plays, and be man of the match.</p>
      <p>‘But he needs to go through a process to bring the real Dele back because the real Dele is the one who has impressed us all.’</p>
