      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:17:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Game of Thrones actor Kristofer Hivju has revealed the cast of the epic fantasy series did shoot an alternate climax.</p>
      <p>The actor, who played Tormund Giantsbane, the leader of the Free Folk, in the HBO show, the other ending was filmed “mostly for fun”.</p>
      <p>“Well, we shot an alternative ending. That was mostly for fun but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that,” Hivju told Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>When prodded to disclose the details, the 40-year-old Norwegian actor didn’t spill the beans but teased that “it was fun”.</p>
      <p>Hivju said, like many GOT fans, even he was shocked by the ending.</p>
      <p>“The funny thing is after season seven I had my theories, fans ahead theirs’, everybody the cast had their theories so there were thousands of theories.</p>
      <p>“To choose one path would be difficult to say but there were many things I didn’t see coming; there was the element of surprise which I liked,” he added.</p>
      <p>In contrast, some of Hivju’s co-stars Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Maisie Williams had previously said the finale of the show won’t have multiple endings to avoid spoilers.</p>
      <p>However, in 2017, HBO programming president Casey Bloys had said the team had taken the measure to shoot multiple climaxes to keep the potential hackers guessing till the end</p>
