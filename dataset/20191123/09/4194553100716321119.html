      <h1>Stats show Liverpool’s offensive play has improved on last season – and Fabinho is making the difference</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:39:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Here is a scary thought for the rest of the Premier League: Liverpool have got better since last season.</p>
      <p>According to an interesting article in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-could-finally-be-liverpools-year-for-real-this-time/">FiveThirtyEight.com</a>, it is pointed out that the Reds’ key performance metrics in an attacking sense are much improved this season compared to last.</p>
      <p>Measured per 90 minutes, ball recoveries are up by 2.9, chances created are up by 1.7 and shots are up by 1.5. Alongside that, possession being won back in the final third has increased by 1.7 instances per 90 minutes, with key passes up by 0.6.</p>
      <p>Those increases can be reasonably put down to the form of Fabinho. Taking the stats out of the equation for a second, a simple ‘eye test’ – watching the Reds’ games – shows that Fabinho has been especially proactive in winning the ball back high up the pitch.</p>
      <p>His aggressive tackles and clean recoveries mean the ball is won back higher up the pitch, closer to the opponent’s goal. That, in turn, means that more chances are created, and therefore more goals can be scored.</p>
      <p>Most people would have noticed the Reds’ improvement this season – and, in particular, the good form of Fabinho – and the stats seem to back that up.</p>
