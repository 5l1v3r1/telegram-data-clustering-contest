      <h1>4 out of 5 teens inactive and not getting enough exercise: WHO</h1>

      <p>Kids as young as 2 are getting hooked to gadgets and it is not surprising to see more kids developing an unhealthy obsession with the screen. Needless to say, getting dehooked from the screen is the need of the hour. According to newer reports, this habit is also pushing 90% of adolescents and teens to become 'inactive'.</p>
      <p>According to a recently released report by the World Health Organisation, 4 out of 5 teens globally are not getting enough physical activity and exercise, which is crucial for their health. The report further went on to state that children aged between the ages of 11-17 failed to register even one hour of physical activity on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Findings of the study</b>
      </p>
      <p>The report on global teen trends centered around physical activity surveyed kids aged between 11-17. In the first of its kind published report, a study was conducted on around 1.6 million students out of 146 countries between the years 2001-2015.</p>
      <p>Researchers involved in the study surveyed kids on a range of parameters-involving questions like how much physical activity they get during their schooling hours, on their own and the type of activities they indulged in.</p>
      <p>The study's findings drew shocking results. According to WHO suggestions, teens should be indulging in a minimum of one-hour activity every day, which includes a form of incidental movement, walking, engaging in household chores and proper workouts and formal exercises. Teens involved in the study failed to register the same.</p>
      <p>Exercise is not just important for adults but for teens. Regular bouts of workout and exercise can be helpful in fighting the risk of obesity, improve heart and respiratory function, boost mental health, brain function and also improve concentration powers. It also helps a big deal in preventing disorders and keeping fertility levels in the toe.</p>
      <p>The study observed that while there was no one specific cause of the staggering statistics, a big cause of concern was the unhealthy obsession with the screens from a young age. The rise in electronic dependency, poor infrastructure and insecurity were also big challenges keeping kids away from the playground.</p>
      <p>The most staggering rates of inactivity were observed in Asian countries. South Korea registered the highest rate of inactivity, with as many as 97% of the teens not meeting guideline requirements.</p>
      <p>The study also observed that there was a stark difference between genders. While 85% of girls and 78% of the boys failed to get the minimum required activity, boys in western countries and girls in south Asian countries were able to get the most exercise. Girls, in particular, were more active in just 4 countries surveyed in the study. India lagged behind on the data, with teens getting less exposure to exercise as compared to their peers. Traditional beliefs and skewed 'physical activity promotion amongst boys' were the biggest cause of concern for the gender gap, with the biggest gap observed in the United States and Ireland.</p>
      <p>Asserting the need for parents and educators to make exercise a priority and push kids to engage in physical activity, researchers said that the participation needs to be equal so that health goals are met with before 2030:</p>
      <p>“The boy-girl differences in inactivity show us we need to think carefully and innovatively about what girls and boys enjoy and want to participate in,”</p>
