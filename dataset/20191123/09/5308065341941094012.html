      <p>A small hotel located in Japan’s Fukuoka prefecture offers a special promo for budget travellers.</p>
      <p>Regular overnight accommodation at the Asahi Ryokan hotel costs US$27 (S$36), but it can cost only one dollar if the guest agrees to livestream their entire stay at the hotel.</p>
      <p>Tetsuya Inoue (27) manages the Asahi Ryokan hotel. He came up with the idea of livestreaming his guests as he was brainstorming on improvements for his business model.</p>
      <p>He shared that he got the idea from a British traveller who live-streamed his stay in the hotel.</p>

      <p>A video camera is set up in just one room in the hotel, and the audio is disabled so guests can still have private conversations.</p>
      <p>Tetsuya explained that guests may also opt to turn off the lights in the room, and the bathroom is off limits as well.</p>
      <p>Guests are also prohibited from performing “lewd acts” and sharing their personal information like passport and credit card numbers while being livestreamed.</p>

      <p>He only started offering the promo last month, and four guests have already agreed to his terms.</p>
      <p>“Young people nowadays don’t care much about the privacy. Some of them say it’s OK to be [watched] for just one day,” Tetsuya shared in an interview with <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/livestream-hotel-room-japan-intl-hnk/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>He streams and uploads the content on the hotel’s official YouTube channel, One Dollar Hotel.</p>
      <p>During streams, strangers all over the world gather together in the chat box to watch what the guests are doing, most of the time they’re just sleeping.</p>
      <p>Tetsuya can begin monetizing his channel for ad revenue once it reaches more than 4,000 view hours.</p>
      <p>One Dollar Hotel is located in 2-6-2, Kiyokawa, Fukuokashhi, Fukuoka-Prefecture, a city known for its seaside culture./TISG</p>
