      <p>Doha: The National Museum of Qatar (NMoQ) has added one more weekend attraction with yesterday’s launch of Baraha Souq, an artisan market located right in the museum’s Baraha courtyard.</p>
      <p>It was a vibrant Friday evening as visitors flocked to the various stalls offering a wide array of locally made products including artworks, handicraft, jewellery, organic and halal cosmetics, farm to table and organic food, healthy drinks and local date products, among others.</p>
      <p>Baraha Souq is operated by IN-Q Enterprises, the commercial arm of Qatar Museums, in partnership with Torba Markets, founders of the successful Torba Farmers’ Market in Education City. </p>
      <p>“There are about 20 vendors today but we are going to have 50 pretty soon and a lot of improvements to come as more cultural events, live music and many other things bring life to the market,” Laurent Cartier, Head of Business Development at IN-Q Enterprises, told <i>The Peninsula</i>.</p>

      <p>Initially, the market is open every second Friday and Saturday, increasing in frequency in the coming months. It will be open from 2pm to 7pm on Fridays and from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays.</p>
      <p>“We are starting with twice a month but the plan is to hold it every week. This is really a community gathering because in addition to what you can find in the stalls, it will be nice to hang around to enjoy the different events being planned,” said Cartier, adding among the events will be traditional shows related to Qatari history and culture. </p>
      <p>Vendors are also excited of having the market located right in the centre of NMoQ, which has already proved a major crowd puller with 132,000 visitors the first month of its opening. </p>
      <p>“It’s great. It’s at the centre of Doha and it’s a very popular museum attracting a diverse crowd of locals, residents and tourists so it’s really a vibrant place,” American Umm Hashim of Handwoven in Qatar told The Peninsula.</p>
      <p>Umm Hashim, who weaves natural materials, is representing a small group of hand weavers and spinners in Doha who come from diverse backgrounds.</p>

      <p>“I weave different natural materials such as cotton, wool and silk and one lady is a spinner who makes yarn out of materials from the animal souq like camel, sheep or goat wool, so we make locally made products,” she said, adding they also source materials from other countries such as Turkey, Japan, Canada and the US.</p>
      <p>Using a Japan made freestyle looms of varying sizes, she weaves beautiful scarves and garments that can be incorporated to dresses as sleeves or accents, while some of the weavers make rugs, towels, or baby blankets. Baraha Souq supports artisans and food makers in Qatar by providing them the chance to bring their products closer to a wider audience. It is open today from 9am to 7pm.</p>
