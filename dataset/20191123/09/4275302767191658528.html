      <h2>A Fife burger van owner was left shocked when Brit Award winner Tom Walker proposed to her live on the radio.</h2>

      <p>Hayley Wilkins went into a daze when the singer-songwriter popped the question on behalf of her partner Steve Craig.</p>
      <p>She had been preparing food in her van in Glenrothes when she heard the surprise message on Kingdom FM’s breakfast show, hosted by Dave Connor and Vanessa Motion.</p>
      <p>Regular listener Steve had heard the singer was to be a guest on the show and asked the presenters if they would get him to propose for him.</p>
      <p>Tom, who is currently promoting his new single Better Half of Me – written after he became engaged to his own partner – was only too happy to oblige and said: “Hayley, I love you dearly, and I would be very happy if you would make me the happiest man alive and you would marry me.</p>
      <p>“Lots of love, your favourite person Steve.”</p>

      <p>The musician jokingly accused Steve of taking the shy way out however, and Dave and Vanessa got him on the phone to repeat the proposal himself.</p>
      <p>Steve and Hayley met when he began buying breakfast from her van outside his work at Fife Autocentre in Eastfield Industrial Estate, Glenrothes.</p>
      <p>Romance soon blossomed and the pair are now expecting a baby in February.</p>
      <p>Steve admitted to feeling very nervous while waiting for Hayley’s answer, which thankfully, was a yes.</p>
      <p>Hayley said: “I’m shocked. The girl who works with me said her partner wanted her to have the radio on in the van.</p>
      <p>“They’ve scammed me!”</p>
