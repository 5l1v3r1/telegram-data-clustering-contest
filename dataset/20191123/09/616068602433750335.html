      <p>As of 6 p.m. today, the downtown Safeway will officially be closed.</p>
      <p>It was announced earlier this year the Vernon grocery store will be closing with a Fresh Co. taking its place next year.</p>
      <p>"Beginning this fall, they will close for a four to five month period for renovations and construction, then reopen as FreshCo stores," said Violet MacLeod, communications representative from Sobeys in a release.</p>
      <p>"We’re committed to ensuring these conversions do not impact our pharmacy customers. We will continue to operate temporary pharmacy locations while renovations and construction are underway.”</p>
      <p>A temporary pharmacy has been set up next to the 30th Avenue building which is located near apartment complexes with a high senior population.</p>
      <p>Not unlike tributes to a fallen friend, people have been taking to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/VernonCommunityForum/">Vernon &amp; Area Community Forum</a> page to express their feelings about the closure.</p>
      <p>“Thinking about all my downtown Safeway friends today as they go off to their last day at work. Today marks the end of an era for them and for those of us who live in the core. We are all losing a family, a safe place, a friendly second home and a beacon it was so much more than just a grocery store this was a place where we went to see our friends and neighbours. I send love to my Safeway family on their last day. I encourage everyone to stop by and say goodbye,” said Dawn Tucker.</p>
      <p>Another post read: It will be missed by many but not forgotten for sure.. They were a bonus to the neighbourhood in service, and staff...and caring. Best to them all.</p>
      <p>The store, which has been in that location for 54 years, held an event in October to honour staff and thank customers for decades of service.</p>
