      <h1>Vicky Pattison shocks followers with unrecognisable throwback photo</h1>
      <h2>The Geordie Shore star has succumbed to the ongoing current trend of sharing a snap from the start of the decade</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:56:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:56</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>Vicky Pattison had fans doing a double take as she shared a jaw dropping throwback photo from the start of the decade on social media.</p>
      <p>Fans and followers of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/vicky-pattison">the 32-year-old reality star</a> couldn’t believe how different she looked - not least because she has since ditched peroxide.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> on Friday, Vicky (who celebrated her birthday earlier in the month) declared she felt compelled to participate in a 10 year challenge <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/gallery/10-year-challenge-photos-celebrities-13863646">(where social media users share selfies from 10 years ago)</a> to mark her current age.</p>
      <p>And the Geordie Shore star explained that her decision to ditch the bleach blonde look from the start of the decade had been inspired by her desire to resemble a more famous fellow Geordie lass.</p>

      <p>“In honour of my 32nd year... here’s a little 10 year challenge for your amusement... 21/22ish to 32,” she began as she shared a snap of herself with long blonde hair, and wearing a lace corset.</p>
      <p>“This was in my underwear as outer wear phase... Height of sophistication at the time, trust me,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“I dyed my hair shortly after this picture was taken to try and look like @cherylofficial .. I mean, I looked like nowt like Chezza but I think we’ll all agree it’s better than the blonde,” she went on.</p>

      <p>“I look at this comparison with great fondness actually- I might be a little bit older, a little bit wiser and have a few more wrinkles but I like the woman I’m becoming, crows feet and all!!” she added.</p>
      <p>Fans were left shocked and in awe of the throwback snaps, with one follower writing: “I can’t see you as the same person.”</p>
      <p>Another commented: “The first pic isn't bad just different.”</p>

      <p>While others were divided on which image they preferred, with one follower writing: “Blonde hair suits you,” while another wrote: “You look so much better now!”</p>
      <p>Vicky’s fortunes have certainly changed over the past decade having gone from obscurity to reality stardom after starring on Geordie Shore between 2011 and 2014, Ex on the Beach in 2014, and I’m A Celeb in 2015.</p>
      <p>She was then a host of I’m A Celeb: Extra Camp in 2016, but was dropped after one series.</p>
      <p>More recently, and perhaps more akin to Cheryl Tweedy, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/vicky-pattison-admits-arrest-after-18333114">Vicky admitted she had been arrested after getting into a fight with other women in a nightclub</a> during a candid conversation about her life experiences.</p>
