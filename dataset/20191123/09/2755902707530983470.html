      <p>Trevor Ncube a member of President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s Advisory Council (PAC) has seemingly warned that another coup may be imminent. Ncube who is the owner of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) and one of the Presidential Advisors posted a cryptic social media post in which he seems to warn that there will be another coup in Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p>Writing on micro-blogging site Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/TrevorNcube/status/1197917641626865667">Ncube said</a>,</p>
      <aside>“Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.” Winston Churchill #quote<br/>A coup begets a coup, another coup begets a coup etc<br/>What goes around comes around and goes around etc, etc</aside>

      <p>The presidential advisor did not elaborate further on his cryptic tweet but posted another one a few minutes later in which he argued that people should only be loyal to their countries and not to their political parties or presidents. Said Ncube,</p>
      <aside>“Patriotism is supporting your country ALL the time, and your government when it deserves it.” Mark Twain #Quote<br/>Your political party is not your country. Your President is not your country.<br/>Focus!!</aside>

      <p>It’s curious to note though, that a military intelligence directorate linked website, <a href="http://spotlight-z.com/">Spotlight Zimbabwe</a>, has been claiming, that President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s removal was imminent for the better part of this year.   While some of the claims seem spurious and fantastic, the website accurately predicted the military coup against former President Robert Mugabe back in 2017.  According to the reports, the military is unhappy with the way the economy has deteriorated under Mnangagwa.</p>
      <p>Ncube was a rabid critic of former President Robert Mugabe and his policies. However, he seems to have had a change of heart after Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s right-hand man and alleged chief enforcer over many years came into power in November 2017.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Mnangagwa deposed his former mentor via a military coup, a great betrayal that Mugabe never forgave him for. The former President died a bitter man and refused to be buried at the National Heroes Acre because he did not wish to give Mnangagwa a chance to pontificate over his body.</p>
