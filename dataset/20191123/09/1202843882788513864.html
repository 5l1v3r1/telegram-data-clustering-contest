      <p>Doha: Indonesia’s stunning nature, rich culture and beautiful people are encapsulated in 40 photographs featured at “The Land of Hope” exhibition which opened on Thursday at Katara Cultural Village.</p>
      <p>Presented by Katara and the Indonesian Embassy, the exhibition is the first solo international show of Indonesian travel photographer Josua Alessandro.</p>
      <p>“I took these 40 images during my ten years of adventure to different places in Indonesia. I really hope that this exhibition can provide a fresh perspective and new information about Indonesia. We have so many cultures, languages and beautiful landscapes. I hope our Qatari brothers and sisters can come and enjoy the exhibition,” Alessandro told The Peninsula at the opening night.</p>
      <p>“This is my third exhibition and first internationally. My first two exhibitions were both in Jakarta, Indonesia,” he said.</p>
      <p>A festival performer with her ostentatious headdress on, mountains enveloped by mist as the early morning sun rises and the spectacle of a royal wedding are some of the images on show at the exhibition.</p>
      <p>The artist reveals his great skill and talent capturing on lens the emotion of an elaborately dressed character of a theatrical play with his makeup on, the beauty of the Indonesian village in the dark of the night or simply the lines on the face of an old woman. “The uniqueness of the Indonesian people has always attracted me. I try to present all of Indonesia’s riches and beauty of nature and uniqueness in this photo exhibition and I hope they can at least represent my stories of Indonesia,  a rich country that is brimming with hope for the future,” said the artist.</p>
      <p>The exhibition launch was attended by Indonesian Ambassador, Muhammad Basri Sidehabi, and Katara General Manager, Dr. Khalid bin Ibrahim Al Sulaiti, along with ambassadors of other diplomatic missions, members of the Indonesian community and art enthusiasts.</p>
      <p>“This is the first time for an Indonesian photo exhibition here and the aim is to introduce Indonesia, how beautiful our culture  and the scenery are. I hope many tourists and visitors come to Indonesia,” said Sidehabi.</p>
      <p>“Art galleries are a wonderful window to learn about different parts of the world. We have here pictures of several places in Indonesia, which is characterised by beauty and diversity of nature. This is an opportunity for all visitors to see the world through images,” said Al Sulaiti.</p>
      <p>“We in Katara look forward to having these exhibitions and activities a bridge of communication between peoples,” he said, adding that “anyone can get to know a country through information, but the arts, with its various tributaries, bring human feelings and open horizons to increase ties at different levels,” added Al Sulaiti. The exhibition is open to the public until December 4 from 10am to 10pm at Katara Building 22.</p>
