      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Ajit Pawar, who earlier Saturday <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/in-massive-twist-devendra-fadnavis-takes-oath-as-maharashtra-cm-ajit-pawar-deputy-cm-3853881/">took oath as the Deputy Chief Minister</a> of Maharashtra, has been removed by his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as the leader of its legislative party. A new NCP legislative party leader will be elected at 4 PM today, his uncle and NCP chief Sharad Pawar announced.</p>
      <p>Devendra Fadnavis took oath as two-term Chief Minister of Maharashtra earlier today in a stunning turn of events.</p>
      <p>According to reports, Ajit Pawar allegedly submitted a letter of support from all 54 NCP MLAs to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari leading to swearing-in ceremony taking place. Several NCP leaders, including Sharad Pawar, have said that a list of MLAs taken for attendance was misused by Ajit Pawar as the letter of support of the NCP MLAs.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a joint press conference with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, the NCP chief said, “Parties had their MLAs list signed by all MLAs, a similar list of NCP was with Ajit Pawar, as he is CLP of NCP. I assume that he has submitted the same list. I am not sure about this but I suspect that this may be the case. We will discuss with the Governor.”</p>
      <p>“Today, a new NCP legislative party leader will be elected here at 4 PM,” he added. He also said that according to his sources, 10-11 NCP MLAs were taken to Raj Bhavan; of those, three MLAs were present at the press conference.</p>

      <p>Sharad Pawar has already announced that Ajit Pawar’s decision <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/maharashtra-political-twist-ajit-took-personal-decision-to-support-bjp-alleges-ncp-chief-sharad-pawar-3853998/">was his personal</a> and not that of the NCP.</p>

      <p>This was reaffirmed by his daughter and Baramati Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule who <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/maharashtra-party-family-split-says-ncp-leader-supriya-sule-on-whatsapp-amid-dramatic-rift-with-cousin-ajit-3854129/">updated her WhatsApp status</a> with the message, “Party and family split.”</p>
