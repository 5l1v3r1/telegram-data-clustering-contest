      <p>Russi Taylor, the voice actor behind The Simpson’s Martin Prince passed away earlier this year, and the final episode of her voicing the character is set to air on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Simpsons’ executive producer Matt Selman confirmed that the final episode will air on Sunday, telling fans: ‘This Sunday’s episode of @TheSimpsons features the last vocal appearance of the wonderful, hilarious Russi Taylor as Martin Prince.</p>
      <p>‘It turned out to be an epic farewell, one Russi would have loved.’</p>
      <p>Despite it being the last episode voiced by Russi, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/simpsons-replace-martin-prince-voice-actors-death-11079046/">the character of Martin will live on, and will be voiced by Grey DeLisle-Griffin,</a> who is best known for voicing Daphne in Scooby Doo and Vicky on Nickelodeon’s The Fairly OddParents.</p>
      <p>As well as her role as Martin Prince, Russi also was the voice of Minnie Mouse in several Mickey Mouse movies, and Huey, Dewey, Louie and Webby in DuckTales.</p>

      <p>According to Entertainment Weekly: ‘The Simpsons face various Thanksgiving nightmares, including the first Thanksgiving, an A.I. mishap and a dangerous space mission complicated by a sentient cranberry sauce. ‘</p>
      <p>Matt Selman added: ‘Russi’s Martin goes out in memorable style.’</p>
      <p>Martin Prince has been a staple of Springfield’s cast of characters, being a bit of an overachiever and Nelson Muntz’s favourite target to bully.</p>
      <p>As well as Martin, Russi was also the voice behind several other characters including twins Sherri and Terri, Uter Zorker and Dr. Hibbert’s daughter.</p>
