      <h1>David Tennant unrecognisable as necrophiliac serial killer Dennis Nilsen for ITV</h1>
      <h2>The Scottish actor will be playing the notorious killer who murdered at least 12 men in the 1970s and '80s</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:26:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:26</time> by <a rel="author">Mirror .co.uk</a></address>
      <p>David Tennant has eerily transformed into notorious serial killer Dennis Nilsen for a new ITV drama that will spotlight the demented murderer.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/david-tennant">The 48-year-old Scottish actor</a> looks disturbingly similar to the Scottish serial killer who murdered at least 12 men in London between 1978 and 1983.</p>
      <p>David’s transformation is for a three part drama titled Des that will chronicle the trial of Dennis Nilsen following his murderous actions - who was jailed for life in 1983, and later died behind bars in 2018 aged 72.</p>
      <p>The show will co-star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/line-of-duty">Line Of Duty</a> actor Jason Watkins as mass murderer biographer Brian Masters, and further Line Of Duty star Daniel Mays as Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay.</p>

      <p>The mini-series is written by Luke Neal and developed by Luke and Broadchurch director Lewis Arnold.</p>
      <p>“This starts with Nilsen's arrest and is looking at him through the eyes of the police officer trying to identify those he killed and deliver justice,” ITV head of drama Polly Hill said.</p>
      <p>“David Tennant is going to be brilliant as Nilsen and, with Daniel and Jason, this has an incredible cast,” she added.</p>

      <p>“Dennis Nilsen's crimes shocked the nation in the early 1980s,” executive producer Kim Varvell stated.</p>
      <p>“Our programme focuses on the emotional impact of those terrible crimes, both on those who came into contact with Nilsen himself, and also on the victims' families,” she continued.</p>
      <p>“We're thrilled to be working with Luke and Lewis on this project, as well as the incredible cast,” she added.</p>

      <p>Dennis was convinced of six counts of murder and two of attempted murder in 1983 after killing a string of gay and homeless men in London.</p>
      <p>The killer would pick up victims in bars before taking them back to his flat, plying them with alcohol and then killing them.</p>
      <p>He was revealed to strangle or drown his victims, before bathing them, dressing them, and keeping their bodies for extended periods.</p>

      <p>He would then dismember the bodies, and burn them or flush body parts down the drain - with blockage caused by body parts ultimately leading to his crimes being uncovered after other people in his apartment block summons a plumber to investigate why the drains were blocked, leading to the discovery of a drain filled with human flesh and bones.</p>
      <p>After being arrested under suspicion of murder by police, Dennis is said to have confessed to killing 15 men between 1978 and 1983.</p>
