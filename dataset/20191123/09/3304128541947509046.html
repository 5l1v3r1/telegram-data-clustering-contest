      <p>A viral video that has circulated on social media regarding a female cashier who was mercilessly assaulted by a male supervisor, with nobody coming to her rescue from EastMatt Kitengela branch has angered netizens.</p>
      <p>In the video, the male supervisor was in a confrontation with the cashier, prompting him to slap her severally and dragging her from her seat while brutally beating her up.</p>
      <p>There is no one captured coming to her rescue until the beatings get worse, that a few employees jumped in and came to the lady’s aid.</p>

      <p>According to social and human rights activists, the video was a representation of what female colleagues go through at their places of work, with very few stipulated laws to protect them.</p>
      <p>As the pressure mounted, the supermarket has issued a notice stating that the captured behavior was prohibited at the work premises, adding that the Supervisor had been suspended following the incident.</p>
      <p>‘We as EastMatt condemn and do not stand for such heinous acts of disrespect against out staff more so women. the individual in question acted solely and has since been suspended with a report officially being filed at Kajiado County Police,” read the statement.</p>
      <p>The statement also made it clear that the matter was being handled accordingly with the management as well as the authorities that had been indulged.</p>

      <p>Additionally, the brutally abused cashier is getting adequate medical attention with the supermarket management working to create a conducive environment to protect its staff against such circumstances.</p>
      <p>However, Kenyans on social media are up in arms to ensure the supervisor is completely expelled and even reprimanded stating that if he goes unpunished, a culture will be created and tolerated that supports violence against women.</p>
