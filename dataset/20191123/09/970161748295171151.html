      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/romelu-lukaku/">Romelu Lukaku</a> has revealed that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/">Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</a>’s decision to play him on the right wing convinced him to leave <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international was sold to Inter for £74 million this summer, while Solskjaer was open to selling the striker despite being unable to sign a replacement.</p>
      <p>Lukaku told Solskjaer that he wanted to leave Old Trafford in late April and admits being played on the right side of United’s attack in the 2-1 win over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> earlier that month was the tipping point in his desire to leave.</p>
      <p>But despite being played out of position, Lukaku has no ill-feeling towards Solskjaer or United’s hierarchy as they did not stand in his way when he pushed for a transfer.</p>

      <p>‘It was after the game against West Ham at home, Solskjaer decided to put me on the right wing, very wide,’ Lukaku told Corriere dello Sport.</p>

      <p>‘The experience in Manchester made me head stronger because not everything went as I had expected. I didn’t win what I was hoping for, my performance was not entirely positive and I didn’t even feel 100 per cent wanted.</p>
      <p>‘Not so much from the technical staff or from my teammates, but from the people around.</p>
      <p>‘So after the match against Chelsea, on April 28, the coach called me for a meeting and I told him what I thought and that I wanted to leave.</p>
      <p>‘He read in my face that I didn’t want to stay any longer and he replied that he didn’t want to hold anyone against it.</p>
      <p>‘He understood my point of view and assured me that he would do everything possible to satisfy me.</p>

      <p>‘He earned my respect and, until I left Manchester, there was no problem with him.</p>
      <p>‘Even the management helped me. I also spoke with Ed Woodward and Matt Judge and everyone understood why I wanted to leave.</p>
      <p>‘It was a frank and honest conversation. There was no war, but the decision was shared.</p>
      <p>‘This is why the leaders of United and Solskjaer will have my eternal respect.’</p>
