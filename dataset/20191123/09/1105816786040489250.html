      <h1>Govt questions PML-N’s silence on Nawaz’s illness</h1>

      <p><b>SIALKOT: </b>Another close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan has cast doubt on illness of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and said Nawaz’s party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), has not shared any update on his health since his exit to London on a special governmental permission.</p>
      <p>“The PML-N leaders and activists repeatedly stated that the former premier’s condition is critical, but they are unable to inform the public about any recent developments,” Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan said on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“It has been several days since former premier travelled to London for treatment but there hasn’t been a single report on his health. Nawaz Sharif’s health is linked to palaces. When he arrives at a palace, he recovers,” she said.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Imran Khan, whose government allowed the convicted former PM to fly abroad on recommendation of a governmental medical board, on Friday also said “the body language of Nawaz Sharif betrayed his medical condition”.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old Sharif family patriarch was flown to London in a Qatar Airways air ambulance earlier this week after the Lahore High Court scrapped a condition set by the government to allow him to travel abroad for treatment of his condition which was initially diagnosed as ITP, a bleeding disorder.</p>
      <p>“Contrary to his medical reports which reportedly suggested his heart, lungs and platelets were in a critical condition, he suddenly seems to be in good health as he boarded the plane for London,” Imran had said while speaking at the launch of work on seven mega development projects in Mianwali.</p>
      <p>Dr Firdous also said the government will launch a crackdown on profiteers to control prices of essential items in the country. She said the government is currently facing two challenges – unemployment and inflation – which can only be resolved by wealth creation and job opportunities.</p>
      <p>She reiterated the premier’s commitment to provide relief to the masses and to promote industrial activity in the country. She said the government is committed to extend those facilities to the rural population that are available to those in urban areas.</p>
      <p>The SAPM said the government is evolving a revolutionary national education promotional policy for a uniform educational curriculum and for ensuring easy access to the quality education.</p>
      <p>She said the government has focused on promotion of quality technical education, besides ensuring early launch of technical education in all women colleges with the collaboration of Technical Education &amp; Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) across Punjab.</p>
      <p>She said promotion of female students’ skill development has now become vital, adding that students would be provided advanced technology-based opportunities. She said there would also be job portals in the new national education policy, besides ensuring easy admission of students. “Women empowerment could also help utilise the talent of the women.”</p>
      <p>The SAPM said promotion of industries in the country is the PM’s goal, adding that the government is making hectic efforts to overcome unemployment and price hike. She said the government is taking effective measures to eliminate the role of middlemen to controlling price-hike. “The government would soon launch a nation-wide vigorous drive against the profiteering.”</p>
      <p>Dr Firdous said the Indian government has already snatched all fundamental rights of the oppressed people in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). “India is engaged in state terrorism in the held valley where larger scale human rights violations, custodial killings and genocide of innocent Kashmiris continue,” she said.</p>
      <p>Dr Firdous also distributed appointment letters to newly appointed teachers at Degree College Marakiwal-Sialkot in a special ceremony. She also distributed health cards among deserving people.</p>
