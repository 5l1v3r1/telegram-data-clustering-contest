      <p>A van driver has been rescued by firefighters after becoming engulfed in a river.</p>
      <p>It happened on Exeter Road in Kingsteignton on Saturday morning just after 6am.</p>
      <p>The driver called 999 from the van as water rose to the windows and threatened to overcome him and the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Firefighters used flood rescue suits to get him out.</p>
      <p>Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said: “Fire control received a call from a member of the public reporting that their van had gone into a river and they were inside the van with water going up to the windows.</p>
      <p>“Fire Control quickly mobilised two fire engines from Newton Abbot and a Special Rescue Team from Exmouth whilst advising the caller to escape from their vehicle as they reported it was beginning to lift.</p>
      <p>“Upon arrival, the crews from Newton Abbot stood down the oncoming rescue team and were able to rescue the caller from their van with no injuries. Crews used flood rescue suits and lighting, the person within the vehicle did not require any medical treatment.”</p>
      <p>A weather warning is in force across the region due to heavy rain.</p>
