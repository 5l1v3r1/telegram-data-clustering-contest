      <p>Foreign ministers from the Group of 20 major economies gathered for their last meeting in the Japanese city of Nagoya before moving the presidency to Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia is preparing to host the next G20 summit in November 2020.<br/><br/>Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan has arrived in Nagoya to represent the Kingdom at the meeting, which is the last to be held under Japanese chairmanship.<br/><br/>On the sidelines of the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting, the Saudi minister held a number of bilateral meetings with his counterparts and officials from other countries. Among the officials he met was Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.<br/><br/>During these meetings, the top Saudi diplomat discussed issues of mutual interest, ways of enhancing cooperation and developing bilateral relations.<br/><br/>The two-day event — the last of the eight ministerial G20 meetings to be chaired by Japan this year — was attended by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and US Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.<br/><br/>Attending foreign ministers discussed free trade, sustainable development, and ways to best assist rapidly growing economies in Africa.<br/><br/>The G20 meeting in Nagoya will likely see the foreign ministers briefly explain their official positions on issues rather than seek a consensus on any particular hot topic issue.<br/><br/>The plenary session on Saturday will provide a good opportunity for participants to discuss controversial reform proposals being put forward by the World Trade Organization.<br/><br/>The Japanese Foreign Minister stressed that all the topics discussed tackled very important challenges faced by the international community, noting that his country has begun actively to address these issues.</p>
