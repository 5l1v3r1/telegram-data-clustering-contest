      <p>The BJP on Saturday angrily defended a stunning power grab in Maharashtra that saw Devendra Fadnavis form a government with help from a rebel opposition leader from the NCP.</p>
      <p>Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said at a press conference that before the October state election, Devendra Fadnavis had been the chief ministerial candidate of an erstwhile alliance between the BJP and the Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>The BJP's votes helped the Shiv Sena to a large extent, and the coalition's victory was both a moral and electoral win for the BJP, Prasad said.</p>
      <p>The senior BJP leader also tore into Opposition parties NCP and Congress: he asked them why they indulged in "match-fixing" to grab power when they had admitted that the mandate was for them to sit in Opposition.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress were working to form a governing coalition before Saturday morning's stunning developments.</p>
      <p>In fact, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said last night that all three parties wanted Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena chief, to be chief minister.</p>
      <p>Today, Pawar senior said his party had had no hand in his nephew Ajit Pawar's decision to jump ship.</p>
