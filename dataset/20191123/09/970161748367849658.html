      <p>A granddad accused of dropping his 18-month-old granddaughter from the window of a cruise ship to her death, said no punishment could be worse than the grief of losing her.</p>
      <p>Salvatore Anello is facing negligent homicide charges after granddaughter, Chloe Wiegand, fell from his arms out of an 11th story window on a Royal Caribbean Cruise Ship.</p>
      <p>The tragic incident occurred at 4.30pm on July 7, while the ship was docked in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
      <p>Anello was arrested and charged after he said he placed Chloe near an open window he thought was closed.</p>
      <p>He could receive three years behind bars if convicted, according to reports, but for him nothing compares to the pain of losing his ‘best friend’.</p>
      <p>‘They can’t do anything worse to me than has already happened,’ he told <a href="https://www.today.com/news/grandfather-charged-granddaughter-s-cruise-ship-death-speaks-out-t167939">NBC News</a> on Wednesday, following a court appearance in the Puerto Rican capital.</p>

      <p>Lawyers for the family, from Indiana, US, said little Chloe had asked her maternal granddad to lift her up so she could bang on the glass in a children’s play area.</p>

      <p>But he said he didn’t know there wasn’t any glass and the little girl tragically fell 115 feet onto the concrete dock below, when he raised her up.</p>
      <p>Chloe’s parents, Kimberly, 36, and Alan Wiegand, 41, defended Anello in an NBC interview, saying he was not to blame for what they called a horrific accident.</p>
      <p>The pair said they blame the cruise ship firm for leaving the sliding window open in an 11 story-high children’s play area and to lose their ‘baby this way is just unfathomable’.</p>
      <p>They claim that the company’s oversight to ensure proper safety measures ‘cost our child her life’, adding that Anello was inconsolable following the incident.</p>

      <p>‘He was extremely hysterical,’ Kimberly said. ‘The thing that he has repeatedly told us is, “I believed that there was glass.”</p>
      <p>‘He will cry over and over and over. At no point ever, ever has Sam ever put our kids in danger.</p>
      <p>‘(He’s) very, very distraught. You can barely look at him without him crying. She was his best friend’.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage of the incident will be used in court and Michael Winkleman, representing the family, said what he has seen in the video is ‘pretty consistent with what my client has told me’.</p>

      <p>‘I think a lot of people don’t understand the unique configuration of the ship because it has this window that sort of has this curvature with this railing that goes across it,’ Mr Winkleman told ABC News.</p>
      <p>‘So I think some people maybe thought he was dangling her out the window, but I think it’s very clear from the video that it’s not the case’.</p>

      <p>An eyewitness to the horrific tragedy told Telemundo PR how they’d heard Kimberly’s piercing scream after learning what had happened.</p>
      <p>They said: ‘I looked because of the mother’s cry.</p>
      <p>‘That tonality, a scream of pain of that nature, does not compare with any other scream.’</p>
      <p>Royal Caribbean spokeswoman Melissa Charbonneau told ABC News: ‘This was a tragic incident.</p>
      <p>‘Out of respect for the family’s privacy during this very sad time, and because the government has chosen to charge Mr. Salvatore Anello with negligent homicide in a matter now before the courts, we have no further comment.’</p>
