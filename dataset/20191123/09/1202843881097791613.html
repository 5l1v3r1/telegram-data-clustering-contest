      <p>Tiago Bezerra scored a double as Al Khor fought back from a goal down to beat Al Gharafa 3-1 at the Al Wakrah Stadium in the third round match of Ooredoo Cup yesterday.</p>
      <p>Al Gharafa opened the scoring in the 36th minute through Abdulghani Muneer before  Bezerra struck once in each half  (45+2 and 58) as Helal Mohammed sealed the win with a third goal in the 89th minute.</p>
      <p>Yesterday’s win, Al Khor’s second in the tournament, sent them to the top of the table on goal difference in Group B.</p>
      <p>Al Khor have collected seven points, same as Qatar SC, but the Knights have scored two more goals than Qatar SC’s seven  from three matches.</p>
      <p>They had earlier beaten Al Duhail 7-0 in the previous round following a one-all draw against Al Arabi in the opening match of the 12-team tournament.</p>
      <p>Al Gharafa remained on one point from three games following their second consecutive defeat.</p>
      <p>Al Gharafa were off to a great start when Muneer stepped up with a brilliant 25-yard free-kick which he whipped around the wall and into the far corner of the goal.</p>
      <p>Al Khor responded well and levelled the scores during the first-half injury time. Bezerra leapt high to meet a cross at the back post and firmly headed home, beating goalkeeper Osama Kamel.</p>
      <p>Bezerra scored his second goal with a beautifully-executed free-kick that completely stunned the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Al Gharafa were trying hard for an equaliser but struggled to get back on level terms.  Late into the game, Helal curled in a left-footed free-kick from 25 yards to take the game completely away from Al Gharafa as Al Khor emerged victorious again.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Qatar SC also managed to stay unbeaten in Group B following a one-all draw against Al Arabi at the Al Ahli Stadium.</p>
      <p>Kayke Rodriguez scored in the 55th minute as Qatar SC took the lead before Al Arabi levelled through Abdulla Marafy’s goal in the 83rd minute.</p>
      <p>The third match of the day saw Al Sailiya and Al Duhail settling in for a 2-2 draw at the Al Ahli Stadium.</p>
      <p>Serigne Mbodji (77) and Meshaal Al Shammari (82 penalty) scored for Al Sailiya, while Paolo Edmilson (73) and Ahmed Yasser (88) were on target for Al Duhail.</p>
