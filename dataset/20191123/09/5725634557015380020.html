      <p>This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Carl Icahn's 13F portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Icahn's regulatory <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/921669/000156761919021527/0001567619-19-021527-index.htm">13F Form</a> filed on 11/14/2019. Please visit our <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/1653452-tracking-carl-icahns-portfolio-q2-2013-update">Tracking Carl Icahn's Portfolio series</a> to get an idea of his investment philosophy and our <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4287255-tracking-carl-icahns-portfolio-q2-2019-update">previous update</a> for the fund's moves during Q2 2019.</p>
      <p>This quarter, Icahn's 13F portfolio value decreased ~3% from $26.52B to $25.69B. The number of holdings increased from 16 to 18. The portfolio is very concentrated with the largest five positions accounting for ~75% of the entire holdings: Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IEP">IEP</a>), CVR Energy (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVI">CVI</a>), Herbalife (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLF">HLF</a>), Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CZR">CZR</a>), and Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNG">LNG</a>).</p>
      <p>Carl Icahn is best known for building sizable stakes in businesses and then pushing for changes to increase shareholder value.

      <p>Note: Icahn's 13F filing is a consolidated report and so should not be viewed as a single portfolio. Specifically, Icahn Enterprises holds several of the businesses and the entities in turn hold Icahn Enterprises.

      <p>
        <b>New Stakes</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>HP Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ">HPQ</a>) and Cloudera (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLDR">CLDR</a>):</b> These are the two new stakes this quarter. The 4.63% HPQ stake was established at prices between $17.75 and $21.50 and the stock currently trades at $19.94. Icahn owns ~4.24% of the business. The 1.89% of the portfolio position in CLDR was purchased at a cost basis of ~$5.41. The stock is currently at $9.44. His ownership interest is 19.59%.</p>
      <p>Note 1: On August 12th, it was announced that Carl Icahn had reached an agreement with management at Cloudera: in exchange to keeping his ownership interest capped at ~20%, he gets to nominate two directors to the company's board. Previously, he stated that the Hortonworks (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HDP">HDP</a>) merger had not gone well. That along with the fact that it had an interim-CEO made it a perfect time for him to enter in an activist role. Also, Cloudera was trading at ~1.5x revenue which was very attractive. The stock was trading at $6.85 at the time.</p>
      <p>Note 2: Earlier this month, Xerox (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XRX">XRX</a>) offered $22 per share ($17 cash and 0.137 Xerox for each HP) to buy HP. HP rejected the offer and in response Xerox threatened a hostile bid, if it did not reconsider it by the 25th. Icahn has commented that the combination is a no-brainer. He owns 4.24% of HP and 10.6% of Xerox.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stake Disposals</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>None</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stake Decreases</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Cheniere Energy:</b> LNG is a large (top five) 4.81% portfolio position. The bulk of it was purchased in Q3 2015 at prices between $47.50 and $70.50. Q4 2015 saw a ~15% increase at prices between $36 and $54. There was an about turn in Q2 2018: ~28% reduction at ~$65. The stock currently trades at $60.84. There was a ~16% trimming over the last three quarters.</p>
      <p>Note: Icahn's ownership stake in the business is ~7.2%.</p>
      <p><b>Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX">FCX</a>):</b> FCX is a 1.27% of the portfolio stake established in Q3 2015 at prices between $7.50 and $18.50. Q4 2016 saw a ~12% trimming at prices between $9.50 and $16.50. Q3 2017 saw another ~16% selling at prices between $11.89 and $15.55 and that was followed with a one-third reduction in Q1 2018 at prices between $17 and $20. The stock currently trades at $11.35. Last three quarters have seen another ~23% selling at prices between $8.70 and $14.20.</p>
      <p><b>Occidental Petroleum (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXY">OXY</a>):</b> OXY is a large 4.56% of the portfolio position established last quarter at ~$52 per share. The stock currently trades well below that at $39.58. This quarter saw a ~23% selling at prices between $42 and $53.</p>
      <p>Note: Regarding the sale of stock this quarter, Icahn said he believes he may not be able to win a proxy battle. He also said he may sell more as he thinks it is extremely dangerous to hold the stock. Previously, Icahn was opposed to the merger with Anadarko (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APC">APC</a>) calling it expensive and risky. He was <a href="https://carlicahn.com/open-letter-to-occidental-petroleum-stockholders/">getting ready</a> to fight for shareholder rights through board seats at the company.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stake Increases</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Icahn Enterprises:</b> IEP position has seen consistent increases over the years. The position size increased from ~98M shares to ~102M shares in 2013, to ~109M shares in 2014, to ~117M shares in 2015, to ~130M shares in 2016, to ~158M shares in 2017, 175.4M in 2018, and 190.85M as of Q3 2019. The stock currently trades at ~$63. The increase this year was at ~$68.50 per share.</p>
      <p>Note: IEP Book Value per share is ~$27 per share.</p>
      <p><b>Caesar's Entertainment</b>: The position was disclosed in a regulatory filing in March which showed it owning 66.05M shares of Caesars Entertainment (~10% of the business). This included ~5.8M shares in convertible bonds. Total outlay was $646M for a cost-basis of $9.78 per share. The position was since increased to ~120M shares of beneficial ownership (17.55% of business, majority through equity swaps and convertible bonds). The stock is now at $13.</p>
      <p>Note: Icahn pushed for a sale of the company and in April Anthony Rodio who previously ran Icahn's Tropicana Entertainment was appointed CEO in a deal with the company. In June Eldorado Resorts (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ERI">ERI</a>) agreed to buy the company in a cash-and-stock deal ($8.40 cash and 0.0899 ERI shares for each share of CZR held).</p>
      <p><b>Hertz Global Holdings (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HTZ">HTZ</a>):</b> HTZ is a 2.26% of the portfolio position. It was established in Q3 2014 at a cost basis of ~$105. In Q4 2014, the stake was increased by just over one-third at prices between $72 and $95. Q4 2015 saw another ~23% increase at prices between $51 and $74. Q4 2016 saw another ~125% increase at prices between $21 and $40. The stock currently trades at $15.61. There was a ~17% selling in Q1 2019 at ~$19.45. This quarter saw a ~73% stake increase as a result of a rights offering at $12.95 per share.</p>
      <p>Note 1: Icahn owns around 31% of the business. The total outlay so far is $1.77B and so its overall cost basis is $42.24.</p>
      <p>Note 2: The prices quoted above are adjusted for the Herc Holdings (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HRI">HRI</a>) spinoff in Q2 2016.</p>
      <p><b>Conduent Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNDT">CNDT</a>)</b>: The small ~1% portfolio stake came about as a result of Conduent's spinoff from Xerox that closed in January 2017. Terms called for Xerox shareholders to receive Conduent shares in the ratio 1:5. Icahn owned 99M shares of Xerox for which he received 19.8M shares of Conduent. CNDT started trading at ~$15 and currently goes for $6.37. Last quarter saw a ~60% stake increase at around $9 per share. That was followed with a ~21% increase this quarter at ~$6.50 per share. Their ownership interest is at ~18% of the business.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kept Steady</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>CVR Energy Inc.:</b> CVI is a large (top tree) ~12% of the 13F portfolio position first purchased in Q4 2011. The bulk of the current position (71.2M shares: ~71% of the whole business) was purchased through a $30 per share tender offer in H1 2012. The stock currently trades at $45.29.</p>
      <p>Note 1: Two MLPs were carved out since the 2012 tender: CVR Refining, the refining portion, and CVR Partners (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UAN">UAN</a>), the nitrogen fertilizer unit. CVR Energy had majority ownership stake in both. In August 2015, CVR Partners agreed to merge with Rentech Nitrogen. Q2 2018 saw a tender offer whereby new CVR Energy shares were exchanged for CVRR at a valuation of $24.26 per common unit (0.6335 shares of CVI for one CVRR). ~22M new shares were issued.</p>
      <p>Note 2: Icahn disclosed that CVI stock including dividends was up ~62% as of EOY2016 from the tender offer at $30. CVI stock was trading at $25.39 at the time. So, his adjusted cost basis was $15.67 as of that date.</p>

Q2 2018 saw the position sold down by ~25% at $52.50 per share. The stock currently trades at $44.87.</p>
      <p>Note 1: Icahn controls ~24% of the business. In March 2018, Icahn disclosed that his profit on HLF was ~$1B. The stock was trading at ~$46 at the time.</p>
      <p>Note 2: The prices quoted above are adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock-split done in April 2018.</p>
      <p><b>Newell Brands (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWL">NWL</a>):</b> NWL is a ~3% of the portfolio position established in Q1 2018 at a cost basis of $27.40 per share. The stock is now well below that at $19. Q2 2018 saw a ~10% stake increase at prices between $23 and $28 and that was followed with a ~15% increase next quarter at prices between $20.50 and $28. Q4 2018 also saw a ~6% stake increase. Overall, its cost basis is $26.40.</p>
      <p>Note: In April last year, rival activist Starboard Value came to an <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/04fe77b2-46f7-11e8-8ee8-cae73aab7ccb">agreement</a> with Carl Icahn whereby they now together control Newell's board.</p>
      <p><b>Xerox Corporation:</b> XRX is a 2.73% of the portfolio position established in Q4 2015 at prices between $24 and $32. The stock is now at ~$39. There was a ~5% trimming in Q1 2018. Icahn controls 10.60% of the business.</p>
      <p>Note 2: In December 2017, Icahn launched a proxy battle nominating four new board members in an effort to stop the Xerox-Fujifilm (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FUJIF">OTCPK:FUJIF</a>) deal announced earlier. In early May, Xerox scrapped the deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with Icahn and Darwin Deason (another activist alongside Icahn). Earlier this month, following Xerox's offer to acquire HP, Icahn said a merger with HP was a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>Note 3: Icahn's activism earned him three board seats in 2016. Xerox spun-off Conduent and that transaction closed in January 2017. That was followed with a 1:4 stock-split in June. The prices quoted above are adjusted for these two transactions.</p>

Regular-way trading started in early March 2016 with WBT at $13.41. It currently trades at $16.79 compared to Icahn's overall cost-basis of $16.52. There was a ~5% trimming in Q4 2017.</p>
