      <p>The Mets aren’t just looking at new-school candidates for their vacant pitching coach position. A source confirmed they also interviewed Gil Patterson, who has spent the last four seasons coaching in the A’s organization.</p>
      <p>Before his time with Oakland, Patterson, 64, was the Yankees’ minor league pitching coordinator and aided in the development of some of their young pitchers, including Luis Severino.</p>
      <p>Also under consideration are ex-Met Jeremy Hefner, now the assistant pitching coach for the Twins, as well as Queens native Steve Karsay, who played for over a decade in the majors and was the Brewers bullpen coach last season. Chris Fetter, the University of Michigan pitching coach who was a possibility for the Yankees’ pitching coach job that went to Matt Blake, has also interviewed.</p>
      <p>In addition to looking for a pitching coach to fill out Carlos Beltran’s staff, the Mets still need a bench coach, with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/mets-interview-hensley-meulens-for-bench-coach-job/">Hensley Meulens</a>, Jerry Narron and Fredi Gonzalez all candidates.</p>
