      <h1>'Find a club' - Player told to leave Aston Villa in January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa transfer news includes goalkeeper advised to leave AVFC in January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Lovre Kalinic has been told to leave Aston Villa in the January transfer window by Croatia coach Marjan Mrmic.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper has dropped well down <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith’s</a> pecking order and is expected to secure a move away from the club when the window re-opens.</p>
      <p>Joining in January of this year, Kalinic cost <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> £7m from Belgian club Gent but soon lost his place in the side to Jed Steer.</p>
      <p>Steer went on to become a hero in the play-off push which saw Smith’s side win promotion back to the Premier League, while Kalinic has been frozen out.</p>

      <p>The summer arrival of Tom Heaton all but ended any hope Kalinic had of breaking back into the head coach’s plans.</p>
      <p>And Mrmic, Croatia’s goalkeeping coach, says the 29-year-old needs to find a new club to boost his international credentials.</p>
      <p>Talking to Sportske Novosti <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/manager-tells-aston-villa-player-told-find-club-within-month-boost-national-team-hopes/">(via Sport Witness),</a> he said: “They definitely miss it [playing regularly]. After the injury, Kalinic did not play. He did well in training, but [playing in] the match carries its own weight.</p>
      <p>“It is up to Kalinic to find a club within a month and to get minutes. It could probably be a loan. I talked to him, told him not to defend too long, recommended that he go further, he needs that because of his status in the national team. He is on track to realise this.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> tried to offload Kalinic in the summer and it was believed <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/latest-lovre-kalinics-aston-villa-16852454">clubs from Europe were chasing his signature in the final days of the transfer window.</a></p>
      <p>But that interest never materialised and Villa are expected to try to move him on again in January.</p>
      <p>Asked if the stopper's wages could damage his chances of securing a departure, Mrmic said: “I am not going into the financial part, he may have to give up a little on this issue, though it is up to him to decide.”</p>
