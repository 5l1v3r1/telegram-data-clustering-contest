      <p>Resort politics -- a popular euphemism for instances of political parties moving their legislators to hotels in an attempt to avoid poaching -- is set to begin in Maharashtra after the Bharatiya Janata Party pulled a stunner with Devendra Fadnavis taking oath as the chief minister Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>Just last evening, the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and Congress looked set to come together and form government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>However, Saturday morning had a surprise in store with NCP's Ajit Pawar, who is the nephew of party chief Sharad Pawar, apparently breaking ranks and lending support to Devendra Fadnavis. Ajit Pawar took oath along with Fadnavis as the deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>His uncle Sharad Pawar says he had no idea about his nephew's move while Supriya Sule, Sharad's daughter and Ajit's cousin, announced a "split" within the NCP and the Pawar family.</p>
      <p>As things stand, Devendra Fadnavis is the chief minister of Maharashtra and Ajit Pawar his deputy. Fadnavis will now have to prove majority on the floor of the Maharashtra assembly. The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress are confident Fadnavis will lose the floor test.</p>

      <p>And to that end, the parties have begun sequestering their MLAs from Maharashtra. The Congress, India Today TV has learnt, is planning to move its MLAs out of the state. While the party was earlier considering moving the MLAs to Madhya Pradesh, it has now decided to move them to Rajasthan's Jaipur. Both the states are ruled by the Congress.</p>
      <p>The NCP, sources told India Today TV, too is planning to move its MLAs to a 'safe' location. However, it remains to be seen how many MLAs are with Sharad Pawar and how many with Ajit.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, MLAs of the Shiv Sena are currently at a hotel in Mumbai where they are waiting for their party chief Uddhav Thackeray, who until last evening was set be the chief minister of Maharashtra, to come address them.</p>
      <p>Will Devendra Fadnavis be able to prove he has the support of the Maharashtra assembly?</p>
      <p>We will know soon.</p>
