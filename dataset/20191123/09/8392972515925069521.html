      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> were reduced to tears as Paul revealed the full horror of Kel's abuse in Friday's episodes (November 22).</p>
      <p>He finally opened up to his family after mum Bernie and sister Gemma found topless photos of him as a child, and other boys' pictures, in Kel's flat.</p>
      <p>They had broken in suspecting the security guard was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-daniel-crushed-after-robbery/">behind the burglary at Daniel's flat</a>, while everyone was at Sinead's funeral.</p>

      </p>
      <p>First they found Daniel's laptop and then the incriminating images.</p>
      <p>Bernie was beside herself as the penny dropped and, when she confronted Paul about it, was sickened by the full details.</p>
      <p>Paul recalled how the grooming began when he and Kel went away together without her and Gemma.</p>
      <p>He tearfully revealed that Kel gave him lager and asked him to model for pictures with his top off.</p>
      <p>Paul noted how his then-stepfather figure would always say thank you after he'd abused him, and heartbreakingly spoke of how he loved him and felt special at the time.</p>
      <p>The factory worker then turned on his mother, blaming her for not noticing what was going on under her roof.</p>

      <p>At the end of the episode, Bernie went to the police station declaring she wanted to report the historic abuse of her son.</p>
      <p>Emotional viewers praised actor Peter Ash's handling of the scenes.</p>
      <p>One wrote on Twitter: "Peter Ash has made this heartbreaking, what an actor."</p>
      <p>A second said: "That monologue from Paul there was some outstanding, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking acting."</p>
      <p>A third echoed with: "Paul is breaking my heart, well performed."</p>
      <p>Next week Kel is arrested, after being confronted by Bernie.</p>
