      <p>Brazil's so-called Buffalo Soldiers, riding giant animals were snapped by photographer Fernando Camara during a patrol on the island of Marajo.</p>
      <p>The local police force use these animals as the island, located in the Amazon estuary, has a large population of domesticated and feral water buffalo â€“ over 450,000 heads.</p>
      <blockquote>"It has become a bit of a tourist attraction", Camara said. "But it was started with the objectives of reinforcing safety and maintaining the culture of the local population".</blockquote>
