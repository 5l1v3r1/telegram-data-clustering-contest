      <h4>EXW Wallet’s Nomination</h4>
      <p>The EXW Wallet’s payment services have been nominated for the “Best Crypto Payment Service Provider” award at the Next Block Guru Awards 2019. The prominent services for which the EXW Wallet earned this nomination include its innovative payment and crypto trade solution that can earn its users daily bonuses, their crypto-based POS system, their unique crypto credit card, their long term car rental, and their real estate clouds program.</p>
      <h4>EXW Bonus Wallet</h4>
      <p>Starting with the EXW Wallet, it allows anyone to trade between BTC/ETH and fiat currencies and especially their own EXW token. Anyone can purchase the EXW token and use it as a cryptocurrency or they can store it in the EXW Bonus Wallet. When deposited in the Bonus wallet, the EXW Exchange awards bonuses to token users for simply holding the EXW token.</p>
      <h4>EXW POS System</h4>
      <p>The EXW POS System is a visionary approach towards supporting the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general. The POS System will integrate seamlessly into the existing infrastructure, just like old-fashioned fiat currency-based POS systems. However, the EXW POS will use cryptocurrencies as it’s only meant to transfer value and pay for goods and services. The POS is meant to manifest blockchain technology at the very core of today’s established retail stores.</p>
      <h4>EXW Crypto Credit Card</h4>
      <p>The EXW’s Credit Card will be built upon its special cloud platform called EXW Cloud Payment. Yet the card will be still connected to a separate bank account. The hybrid mechanism for combining traditional banking methods and modern cryptocurrency-based credit solutions are one of a kind.</p>
      <h4>EXW Car Program</h4>
      <p>Another service offered is the EXW Car Program. This program allows its users to rent their dream cars on a long-term basis without overdrawing their bank accounts. Through purchasing and hold the EXW Token in their bonus wallets, users can redirect their bonuses to pay for the monthly rent of their dream car.</p>
      <h4>EXW Flight Program</h4>
      <p>The EXW Flight Program will allow its users to book flights anywhere in the world using their cryptocurrency. The program is still in progress and will be launched towards the end of 2019.</p>
      <h4>EXW Real Estate Cloud</h4>
      <p>Through the EXW Real Estate Cloud users of the EXW Token can easily make real estate investments and profit from rising prices and valuations. Using the EXW Wallet and Exchange, EXW Token users will be able to take advantage of this program to make near risk-free real estate investments across the world.</p>
      <p>The EXW Wallet is a creative take on the hardships of the cryptocurrency industry. That’s why the company’s vision is to maximize adoption and manifest cryptocurrencies into people’s daily lives through specifically targeted areas like retail stores with the EXW POS, EXW credit cards, the EXW car program, the upcoming EXW flight program, and the EXW Real Estate Cloud.
