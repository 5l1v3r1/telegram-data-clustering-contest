      <h1>Peter Grant claims Celtic star James Forrest and Ryan Fraser 'can't play' back-to-back matches</h1>
      <h2>The Scotland assistant coach has revealed the injury problems that he claims helped derail Alex McLeish's Scotland.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:31:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Alloa boss Peter Grant has claimed that James Forrest and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-fraser">Ryan Fraser</a> 's bodies didn't allow them to play both games of a double header when he was Scotland assistant manager under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alex-mcleish">Alex McLeish</a> .</p>
      <p>Grant and his boss were sacked in the weeks following a catastrophic 3-0 qualifying loss in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>And the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> midfielder has rounded on the mentality of the players in failing to push themselves for the national cause.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football">Scotsman</a> , Grant said: "Mentally we've never been over the edge.</p>
      <p>He continued: "Guys like Ryan Fraser and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/james-forrest">James Forrest</a> can't play two matches together. You don't get the same performance from then (each time). Their bodies don't allow it.</p>

      <p>Forrest will point to evidence from as recently as last week's international break, where he played both matches as a rebuttal of these claims.</p>
      <p>Sports science also comes in for the Grant treatment.</p>
      <p>He admits it has made strides for conditioning and diet but claims that it can foster a culture of excuse making and mental weakness.</p>
      <p>He said: "Now academies have a thousand kids and the coaches will be like, 'He's had his ten minutes, you go on for five.'</p>
      <p>Listen, good things have come out of sports science. Diet is excellent and players look like athletes. But they don't have the mentality. Young guys will say, 'Oh, I've had a hard day.'</p>
      <p>"I will be like, 'Eh? I do what you do and I'm 54!'</p>
