      <p>Belgian Laurent Simons is on the verge of bagging a degree in electrical engineering from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands at the age of nine.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that Simons, who desires to make artificial organs, will in December become one of the world’s youngest graduates.</p>
      <p>It was learned that the nine-year-old completed the aforementioned course in just nine months instead of the usual three years.</p>
      <p>“I’m currently studying electrical engineering. It’s about designing circuits and things like that. So chips, actually,” AFP quoted him as saying in the Dutch capital Amsterdam.</p>
      <p>“I really like karting. And I like playing with my dog and watching Netflix,” he added.</p>
      <p>And excited Sjoerd Hulshof, programme director for electrical engineering at the university, said Laurent’s qualities were extraordinary.</p>
      <p>“Laurent’s qualities are all simply extraordinary,” Hulshof told AFP, adding that he is “the quickest student we’ve ever seen. And he’s not just hyper-intelligent, but very nice.”</p>
      <p>Laurent was raised in Ostend by his grandparents until the start of 2019, as his parents, Alexander and Lydia, were “busy with work” in the Netherlands, according to AFP.</p>
      <p>He started school at the age of four, and completed primary in a year and a half.</p>
      <p>Come to think of it, it has taken him just five years to go through primary and secondary school and university.</p>
