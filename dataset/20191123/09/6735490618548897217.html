      <p>Daniel Craig stopped by <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/">Global</a>‘s <a href="https://www.globaltv.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/">“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert”</a> on Friday night to talk about his new film “Knives Out”, but the conversation soon turned to his other, far more familiar onscreen persona.</p>
      <p>Set to be released in spring 2020, “No Time to Die” will mark Craig’s fifth outing as Bond, James Bond, and he spoke with host Stephen Colbert about his latest mission on Her Majesty’s Secret Service.</p>
      <p>In the 25th 007 movie, Craig faces off against mysterious villain Safin, played by Oscar-winning “Bohemian Rhapsody” star Rami Malek, who revealed during a previous visit to “The Late Show” that he and Craig had shared a kiss while rehearsing a challenging scene.</p>

      <p>To break the tension, Malek told Colbert, Craig “grabbed me and picked me up and — I can’t tell who initiated the next moment, if it was him or I. But a kiss transpired between the two of us.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m going to say that Daniel initiated it… I took a moment, caught my breath and I looked out and said, ‘So, does this make me a Bond girl?’”</p>

      <p>On Friday’s “Late Show”, Craig confirmed to Colbert that he did indeed give Malek a kiss.</p>
      <p>“How lucky we are to have him,” Craig said of his co-star. “I kiss all my leading men. I think it just breaks the ice.”</p>
      <p>Colbert also pressed Craig to confirm that “No Time to Die” will indeed be his final Bond film. “Are you done with Bond?” he asked.</p>
