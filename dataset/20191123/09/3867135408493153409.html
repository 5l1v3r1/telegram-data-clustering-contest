      <p>In 2000, in a setback for Al Gore, the Florida Supreme Court refused to order Miami-Dade County officials to resume hand-counting its election-day ballots.

      <p>In 2001, the U.N. war crimes tribunal said it would try former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for genocide in Bosnia, linking him for the first time in court to the murders of thousands of non-Serbs and the displacement of a quarter million people.

One Direction won three honors at the American Music Awards, including artist of the year; Katy Perry, absent because of her world tour, also won three awards.</p>
      <p>One year ago: Black Friday shoppers were evacuated from a northwestern Indiana Meijer (MY’-ur) store, and a bomb squad was summoned, after a customer mistook a toy grenade for a real one.
