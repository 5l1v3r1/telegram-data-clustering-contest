      <p>A plane was forced to make an emergency landing in Los Angeles after fire appeared to blow from its right engine.</p>
      <p>The Philippines Airlines flight was heading to Manila when it was forced to turn around after taking off from Los Angeles International Airport.</p>
      <p>The airline said the plane experienced a "technical problem in one of its engines shortly after take-off."</p>
      <p>There were 342 passengers and 18 crew members on board the Boeing 777 plane, the airline company said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/philippine-airlines/pal-statement-on-pr-113-lax-mnl-flight/10158737717478306/">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>One father posted a video from inside the plane on social media showing flames coming out of the right engine. He had been filming his daughter's reaction to taking off.</p>
      <p>Other social media users recorded the plane from the ground.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen fire come out of an aeroplane before," said Andrew Ames, who recorded the plane from the ground.</p>
      <p>The airline said they appreciated the "calmness and patience" of the passengers who they said were being rebooked onto other flights.</p>
