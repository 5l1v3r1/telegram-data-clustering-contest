      <p>(Bloomberg) — Poland’s Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki pledged to stick to a plan to balance the country’s budget next year even as economic growth looks set to slow.</p>
      <p>“The Polish economy is amazingly resilient to a slowdown in the West,” Morawiecki said in an interview on radio station RMF FM. The plan to balance the 2020 state budget for the first time in the nation’s post-communist history “is still valid,” he said.</p>
      <p>The government this week dropped its plan to remove a cap on social security contributions, aiming to boost the budget by 5 billion zloty ($1.3 billion).Morawiecki didn’t name any alternative revenue sources in the interview.His cabinet “will try to defend domestic households” from energy price increases; the government is now awaiting a proposal from the state’s energy regulator and “will seek to work out an appropriate calculation mechanism.”The government plans to “gradually increase the minimum wage” in coming years.</p>
