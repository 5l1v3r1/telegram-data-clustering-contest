      <p>Ghanaian dancehall King, Shatta Wale has descended heavily on Ghanaian blogger, Ameyaw Debrah for personally discrediting his Grammy award nomination.</p>
      <p>Wale who is known for his outburst went vulgar on the celebrity blogger for attempting to discredit him over his technical Grammy award nomination.</p>
      <p>Following the release of the nominations list for the 62nd Grammy Awards, a lot of media personalities have tried to discredit the ‘My Level’ hitmaker as a nominee after Beyonce’s Lion King: the Gift album which he was featured on was nominated.</p>

      <p>With this, many have argued that Shatta Wale cannot be regarded as a nominee since the ‘Already’ track was not nominated; whilst others are of the view that since the album which contains the track has been nominated, Wale automatically qualifies as a nominee.</p>
      <p>In a response to all the ongoing debate, a fumed Shatta Wale in a self-recorded video asked media houses and personalities in Ghana to stop the ‘foolery’ as they are always interested in painting a certain picture of how artists should look like making a particular reference to how Ameyaw Debrah.</p>
      <p>According to Wale, the blogger asked UK based Ghanaian Grammy winner Fuse ODG how he felt for winning a Grammy’s with Ed-Sheeran without been given a plaque whiles the former was given a plague; a disrespect to the entertainment industry and a backbiting attitude.</p>
