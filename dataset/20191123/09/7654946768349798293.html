      <h1>Kyrie Irving to miss 3-game road trip, won’t face Knicks or Celtics</h1>

      <p>Kyrie Irving is going to miss the Nets’ entire three-game road trip, a salivating slate that begins against the Knicks on Sunday at the Garden, and continues against the All-Star guard’s two former teams, the Cavaliers and the Celtics.</p>
      <p>When Irving wasn’t present on the Nets’ bench during <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/22/nets-bottle-up-kings-as-defense-comes-up-big-again/">Friday’s 116-97 win over Sacramento</a>, fans began to wonder why. But he was in the building, and after having his shoulder evaluated, it has been determined that he’ll sit out the upcoming trip.</p>
      <p>Irving will be reassessed once the Nets return to Brooklyn. They host the Celtics in a rematch on Nov. 29.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s concerned about one thing — getting back to being as close to 100 percent as possible. It’s as simple as that,” coach Kenny Atkinson said of Irving before Friday’s game.</p>
      <p>Irving suffered a shoulder impingement during the game at Utah on Nov. 12, and played two days later at Denver, with Atkinson admitting that outing aggravated the injury. A specialist told The Post at the time the guard’s injury would require from several days to a couple of weeks of rest. The Black Friday game against the Celtics at Barclays Center would be exactly two weeks of rest following the game against the Nuggets.</p>
      <p>Atkinson has been on record saying he would prefer Irving have some practice time before returning to the court.</p>
      <p>The Nets aren’t practicing Saturday, aren’t allowed to practice Tuesday after a back-to-back, and are unlikely to practice on Thanksgiving after flying back from Boston before a noon matinee Friday.</p>
      <p>They could conceivably concoct a suitable workout for Irving if his shoulder improves enough.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say ‘have to’ [practice]. We’d like to see some evidence, not just with Kyrie. That’s with Spencer [Dinwiddie], that’s with anybody,” Atkinson said. “We definitely don’t want to throw him out there without observing where he is.</p>
      <p>“But luckily with the staff we have, our whole staff is ex-players, we can create a practice on an off day. We obviously have the facilities and we have the personnel to be able to evaluate in a three-on-three or a four-on-four if we have to.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Friday marked the Nets’ first wire-to-wire victory of the season and most lopsided win of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>The Nets shot 50.6 percent (41-of-81) from the field, their second-best mark this season.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Nets outrebounded the Kings 48-33, with the plus-15 rebounding differential matching their highest of the season.</p>
