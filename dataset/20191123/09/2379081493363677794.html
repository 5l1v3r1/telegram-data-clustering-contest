      <h1>Swimming Goes Pro With League Backed by Ukrainian Billionaire</h1>

      <p>(Bloomberg) — Konstantin Grigorishin speaks for a lot of weary swim parents when he recalls his son Ivan’s debut in the sport as a small child.</p>
      <p>The all-day meets were a “huge stress,” the Ukrainian energy billionaire said in a telephone interview. Swimmers “had to wait for hours and hours before they got to start. It wasn’t exciting or entertaining for them. I decided to organize something that was more fun.”</p>
      <p>More than a decade after starting kids’ swim camps and competitions in Moscow, Grigorishin founded the professional International Swimming League in October.</p>
      <p>The team competition for top-level swimmers is based on a traditional U.S. sports league, with two divisions, a regular season, and playoffs. Touting gender equality and a strict no-doping policy, the ISL has attracted 100 Olympic swimmers — close to half its total roster — across eight teams.</p>
      <p>Exposure Needed</p>
      <p>“I’d like to create a permanent audience for swimming,” Grigorishin said. “It’s the most popular Olympic sport on TV. To be a professional sport you have to be on screens every weekend for five or six months a year.”</p>
      <p>The inaugural U.S. clubs are based in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., with European teams in London, Hungary, Italy and France. The league is in talks to add a Japanese team for next year’s competition, which will start in September after the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>The London Aquatics Centre, a 2012 Olympic venue, will host the four European clubs this weekend to determine which two advance to the finals in Las Vegas Dec. 20-21 against the two California-based teams, the Cali Condors and the LA Current.</p>
      <p>The first-year investment of $25 million is expected to double next year with 27 matches and 10 clubs. More than $4 million in prize money and appearance fees for clubs and athletes will be awarded in the 2019 season. U.S. swimmer Caeleb Dressel, 23, of the Cali Condors — holder of the 100-meter butterfly long-course world record — leads the prize money with $19,700 so far this season.</p>
      <p>FINA Sued</p>
      <p>Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu, the first swimmer to earn $1 million in career prize money, will be one of the featured athletes this weekend. She was instrumental in getting the league set up after calling for a professional swimmers’ union in 2017. Hosszu, 30, and two U.S. athletes sued FINA, the sport’s governing body, in 2018 on antitrust grounds after it warned swimmers who joined the ISL that they risked being banned from the Olympics.</p>
      <p>FINA said in January that swimmers are free to participate in independent competitions and events. It’s also indicated it will recognize world records set at most ISL events, including when Australia’s Minna Atherton, 19, of the London Roar was the first woman to go under 55 seconds for the 100-meter backstroke in October.</p>
      <p>“We have been fighting for this kind of change for some years and now we are in the middle of a revolution in our sport,” Hosszu said in an interview with law firm Withers Worldwide in June. She’s the captain and co-owner of Budapest-based Team Iron.</p>
      <p>“The tensions between commercial entities, professional leagues and associations with control over access to key sporting events, such as the Olympics, are still at a high,” Susannah Bottriell and Elsa Haj Houssain of Squire Patton Boggs wrote in February after FINA’s reversal.</p>
      <p>Many new leagues still face an uphill battle against more entrenched sports. The Arena Football League, a U.S. indoor competition, ceased operations last month, citing financial constraints and litigation. A professional lacrosse league has struggled in the U.S., as has the women’s professional basketball league, the WNBA.</p>
      <p>Spectator-Friendly</p>
      <p>The ISL is hoping its two-hour sessions over two days, with four teams competing, will be both spectator- and media-friendly. Winning is more important than times; athletes get nine points for first place, down to one for eighth. Swimmers also have points deducted for going slower than a set time that’s within about 10% of the world record for that event.</p>
      <p>The matches are shown in the U.S. on ESPN 3, on Eurosport in 62 countries, and elsewhere. The BBC plans to live-stream this weekend’s events. The ISL sold out the Eppley Recreation Center — on the University of Maryland campus in College Park — last weekend, at more than 1,000 tickets a day. London has sold about 1,600 tickets each day plus VIP packages. The league is offering 3,800 tickets a day in Las Vegas for the finals.</p>
      <p>The London Roar’s Adam Peaty, 24, who holds the long-course world records in 50- and 100-meter breaststroke, will be a focus for the home crowd this weekend, along with Florent Manaudou, 29, of France and Chad Le Clos, 27, who both won gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. South African Le Clos is co-captain of Grigorishin’s Energy Standard team.</p>
      <p>The competition is held in the 25-meter short-course format, as opposed to 50 meters of the Olympics. Still, the shortage of venues with large spectator sections is potentially limiting to growth.</p>
      <p>“We are looking for bigger venues, especially in the U.S.,” Grigorishin said, including at convention centers or basketball arenas. Pop-up pools are expensive, though, and take 10 days to install, including getting sufficient water supply. “I’m sure there’s a technical solution,” he said.</p>
      <p>Grigorishin says he swims now for general fitness after a back injury forced him to stop running. And his son? He went on to compete for six-time NCAA champion University of California, Berkeley.</p>
