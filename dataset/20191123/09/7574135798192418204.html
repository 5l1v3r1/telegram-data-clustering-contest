      <p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/failure-member-calls-for-pledgemusic-ceo-to-be-brought-to-justice-reveals-new-research/">we posted</a> about a Facebook post made by Ken Williams of the band Failure about PledgeMusic, the money bands are owed, PledgeMusic’s former CEO Dominic Pandiscia, and an alleged connection to Primary Wave.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/pledgemusic-former-ceo-primary-wave-deny-financial-misconduct-failure-ken-andrews-1203414175/">Variety</a></i> reached out to Pandiscia — “who is working as a consultant for Gaither Music, a gospel and Christian label that partnered with Primary Wave earlier this year” — and he said this:</p>
      <blockquote>“The allegations made against me by Ken Andrews are patently untrue and fabricated. It is irresponsible for any publication to print such inflammatory rhetoric without fact-checking or providing opportunity for comment. Had they done so, it would have cleared up the errors and falsehoods. This leaves me no choice but to explore options for legal action for libel and slander.”</blockquote>
      <p><i><a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/pledgemusic-former-ceo-primary-wave-deny-financial-misconduct-failure-ken-andrews-1203414175/">Variety</a></i> also reached to Primary Wave:</p>
      <blockquote>A Primary Wave representative denied all allegations against the company made in the post.</blockquote>

      <blockquote>Andrews also alleged that under Pandiscia’s watch, Pledge essentially used the money artists had paid to fund their campaigns on company expenses, such as salaries and office space. That accusation has been leveled speculatively by certain individuals against Pandiscia in the past, but others, including former Pledge employees, have claimed to Variety that the company’s board of directors is the actual culprit in that situation; another source said the company actually moved to less-expensive offices during Pandiscia’s tenure. To date no one has commented on the record about the matter.</blockquote>
