      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> was confronted by a furious doctor last night who accused him of lying about NHS funding.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on a BBC Question Time leaders’ special, a junior doctor in the audience told the Tory leader that people are dying as a result of cuts.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I’m a junior doctor in A&amp;E in the NHS and over the past nine years since you’ve been in power, I’ve seen that waiting lists are getting longer, people are on trolleys for hours and hours in A&amp;E.</p>
      <p>‘It’s not just inconvenient, people are dying.</p>
      <p>‘I think you’re lying to us, every year you promise more money for the NHS but the reality is, people who work in the NHS and use it, know that that money isn’t getting through.</p>

      <p>‘Why should we trust that you’re going to get this £26 billion for the NHS when we’ve got years of cuts and people are dying?’</p>
      <p>The Conservatives have said they intend to ‘get Brexit done so we can invest in our NHS, schools, and the police’.</p>

      <p>Ministers have announced their hopes for a £13.8 billion increase in spending across all departments by 2021 and a £33.9 billion boost for the health budget by 2023-24.</p>
      <p>Addressing the issue on Question Time, Mr Johnson claimed that he knew the ‘massive demands’ the health service faced and steered the topic back to Brexit.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Yes, of course, I understand things have been tough in the NHS but I’ve talked to hundreds of doctors and nurses, I know the massive demands that the NHS faces.</p>
      <p>‘We can only meet that demand if we have a dynamic economy, and we won’t get the economy moving until we get Brexit done.’</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time the prime minister has been confronted by angry members of the public about the state of the NHS.</p>

      <p>In September, the father of a sick baby <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/18/angry-dad-girl-almost-died-confronts-boris-nhs-destruction-10765587/">challenged the politician</a> during a hospital visit, claiming Britain’s public health service was being ‘destroyed’.</p>

      <p>The dad, identified as local Labour activist Omar Salem, told Mr Johnson there were not enough doctors and nurses and said his seven-day old daughter ‘nearly died yesterday’.</p>
      <p>The Conservative leader also received a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/boris-johnson-heckled-visits-flood-victims-south-yorkshire-11089792/">frosty reception</a> from flood victims in Stainforth this month, who told him his visit was ‘too little too late’.</p>
