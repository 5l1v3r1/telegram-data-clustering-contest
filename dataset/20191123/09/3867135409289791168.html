      <h2>Marysville Pilchuck suffers its first loss of the year, 56-21, to the Abes in a quarterfinal game.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/joshua-horton/" target="_blank">Joshua Horton</a></address>
      <p>TACOMA — After a lopsided loss to Lincoln on Saturday, the members of the Marysville Pilchuck High School football team weren’t dwelling on the season-ending defeat.</p>
      <p>Rather, they focused on the legacy the 2019 Tomahawks left behind.</p>
      <p>Marysville Pilchuck couldn’t overcome’s Lincoln’s collection of NCAA Division-I prospects and fell in the Class 3A state quarterfinals, 56-21, at the Lincoln Bowl in Tacoma. The loss was the first of the season for the Tomahawks (11-1).</p>
      <p>“There’s no way that loss can define what we did this year,” senior tailback Jordan Justice said. “I mean, we made school history going 11-0. No other team in school history has gone 11-0. It’ll always be a mark on the school and this game doesn’t define this season. I mean, it was a tough loss but we played hard. They were just a good team.”</p>
      <p>Lincoln’s roster includes four of the top 55 seniors in the state, according to 247Sports.</p>
      <p>What this year’s collection of Marysville Pilchuck players can hang their helmets on — especially the seniors — is the turn around they engineered over the past three years. After three consecutive Wesco 3A North championships from 2012-2014, the Tomahawks (11-1) did not post a winning record for three years before eventually breaking through with a 7-3 mark last season.</p>
      <p>A dominant regular season in 2019, in which the Tomahawks won all nine games by an average of 30 points and scored a <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/sports/3a-state-football-mp-earns-dramatic-ot-win-over-prairie/">dramatic overtime win over Prairie in the first round of the state playoffs</a>, cemented the 2019 M-P squad as one of the most successful in school history.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to say (what their legacy is), but gosh I’ll miss them,” Tomahawks head coach Brandon Carson said. “They’ve set us forward quite a ways. Just the group of people that they are. They’re good people, they’re good students, they’re good athletes and I love them to death and I’ll miss them.”</p>
      <p>The Tomahawks will graduate a number of key players, including Justice, an all-conference running back, all-conference wide receiver and defensive back Dillon Kuk, all-conference offensive lineman Justin Albee, and quarterback Jake Elwood. But Marysville Pilchuck also returns a considerable amount of talent, including Dylan Carson, a 1,000-yard rusher, and Jay Gray in the backfield, and Nate Elwood on the offensive line.</p>
      <p>Things got off to a poor start for the Tomahawks on Saturday. Lincoln’s first play from scrimmage was Caden Filer’s 56-yard touchdown pass to Julien Simon that put the Abes up 7-0 just 22 seconds into the game.</p>
      <p>Marysville Pilchuck went three-and-out on its first possession, and although Justice intercepted a deep pass from Filer on the Abes’ next possession, Lincoln’s Jeddiah Hayes intercepted a tipped ball at the line of scrimmage and returned the ball 56 yards for a touchdown to put the Abes up 14-0 with 8:04 in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>Simon, rated a four-star athlete by 247sports for the Class of 2021, caught another touchdown pass on a long catch-and-run, this one a 49-yarder, to put Lincoln up 21-0.</p>
      <p>The Tomahawks did not roll over, though.</p>
      <p>Justice scored from 24 yards out to put the Tomahawks on the board just before the first quarter ended. After a turnover forced by Marysville Pilchuck’s defense, Justice broke off a 53-yard run on the first play of the drive to cut the Abes’ lead to 21-14.</p>
      <p>The two teams traded scores before Simon caught his third touchdown pass of the game with 1:01 remaining in the half to put the Abes up 35-21.</p>
      <p>An unfortunate sequence put the Tomahawks back even further. A three-and-out followed by an inadvertent kneel down by Marysville Pilchuck’s punter at the Tomahawks’ 13-yard line gave Lincoln another chance to strike before halftime.</p>
      <p>The Abes cashed in with 6.1 seconds remaining in the second quarter. Josiah Snow-Marshal just barely kept his feet in bounds and snagged a 13-yard touchdown pass from Filer in the back of the end zone, giving Lincoln a 42-21 advantage going into halftime.</p>
      <p>Despite the disappointing final score, Brandon Carson was happy with his team’s effort.</p>
      <p>“I knew we’d play hard,” the coach said. “A lot of things had to go our way. This (Lincoln) is a really good team and we were going to fight until the end. I knew that from the get-go and that’s what we did. We just ran into a pretty good team.”</p>
      <p>The Abes (10-2) advanced to the state semifinals for the first time in school history. They will face No. 2 Eastside Catholic in the semifinals.</p>
