      <h1>Michail Antonio scores twice in run-out ahead of possible West Ham return against Spurs</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers winger hasn't played since late August after tearing his hamstring for a third time</h2>

      <p>Michail Antonio completed a behind-closed-doors run out last week as he prepares for a potential return from injury in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Hammers winger scored twice in the internal club game as the senior players not on international duty competed against Dmitri Halajko's high-flying U23 youngsters to keep their fitness levels up.</p>
      <p>Antonio has been out injured since late August having torn his hamstring in the seventh minute of the 2-0 Carabao Ccup victory over Newport County and had to undergo surgery in the aftermath once the swelling had died down.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has been ruled out for the past nine games and has been sorely missed, especially in the last six outings, as his teammates have struggled and have dropped down the table like a stone.</p>
      <p>Antonio is set to be in the matchday squad for the visit of Spurs to London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime as Jose Mourinho takes charge of Tottenham for the first time since replacing Mauricio Pochettino at the helm earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Antonio, speaking in an interview in the games matchday programme, said: "I'm feeling good.</p>

      <p>"I've been training with the boys. I played against the U23s last week in a behind closed doors game and it well.</p>
      <p>"I got two goals: the second was a cut back to the edge of the box, I let it roll through my legs and...top bins, 25 yards. Beautiful!"</p>

      <p>Both Antonio and skipper Mark Noble are expected to be fit for the lunchtime kick off later but there is an injury doubt over Jack Wilshere.</p>
      <p>The midfielder had returned to training following a spell on the sidelines with a groin problem but suffered a new issue earlier this week with his stomach, with manager Manuel Pellegrini admitting on Thursday that Wilshere is a doubt.</p>
      <p><b>Football.London</b> understands that Wilshere is likely to be left out of the squad for the game against Spurs, who sacked Pochettino on Tuesday after just three Premier League wins all season.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini has overseen just three top flight wins too and none in their last six games as his team have dropped from fifth in the standings to 16th.</p>
