        <b>Hull City manager Grant McCann has outlined that his club are unlikely to offer Shamrock Rovers defender Lee Grace a deal after the 26-year-old’s trial.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grace spent the past week on trial at the KCOM and despite impressing many, it doesn’t look as though it was enough to convince Hull to invest in his services.</p>
      <p>The Tipperary native had a brilliant season at the heart of the Shamrock Rovers defence proving to be a key figure in their <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/shamrock-rovers-win-fai-cup-against-dundalk/">FAI Cup</a> victory as well as their second placed finish in the league.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/lee-grace-hull-city-shamrock-3569253">Speaking at Hull City’s weekly press conference on Friday,</a> McCann outlined that he felt Grace performed well during his time at the club but that he is currently “pleased” with the options he has at centre-back.</p>
      <p>“Myself and Cliff know that league, especially Cliff. We got him over and we had him in for three or four days. He did well.</p>
      <p>“He’s gone away on holiday with his family now because his season has just finished. Whether we do something or not, we’re not sure.</p>
      <p>“We’re pleased with the four centre-backs we’ve got. In fact, we’re pleased with the six centre-backs we’ve got including the two out on loan as well. In that area we’re well stocked.</p>
      <p>“There’s no real time limit on (making a decision). He can’t play until January even if we did sign him. We’re really pleased with what we’ve got at centre-back.”</p>

      <p>Grace has spent the last two and a half years with The Hoops after joining them from Galway United <a href="https://www.extratime.ie/articles/23975/hull-city-boss-grant-mccann-confirms-club-are-unlikely-to-offer-a-deal-to-shamrock-rovers-lee-grace/">midway through the 2017 season.</a></p>
      <p>His stand out performances this season alongside his defensive partner Roberto Lopes earned the 26-year-old a deserved spot in the PFAI Team of the Season.</p>
      <p>“There’s some really good quality over there,” added McCann. “People do underestimate it, both leagues really. You’ve seen in the Irish League, players like Gavin Whyte (at Cardiff) and Stuart Dallas (of Leeds).</p>
      <p>“There’s hidden gems over there if you know the leagues.</p>
      <p>“We also took Kieran Sadlier from Cork when we were at Doncaster and he’s lighting it up for them this season. He’s their leading scorer. We know the league, it’s about getting the right ones.”</p>

      <p>The Hull City boss also denied any interest from the club in Grace’s Rovers teammate Jack Byrne.</p>
      <p>“Nothing in that,” he said. “No real interest from us on that. We’re pleased with what we’ve got in terms of midfield.”</p>
