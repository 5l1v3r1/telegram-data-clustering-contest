      <h1>A Gift to Donald Trump? Iran's Fuel Price Hike Is Costing It Dearly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Stratfor Worldview</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>Tehran didn’t anticipate that there would be such a large and firm public backlash.</p>
      <p>Widespread protests gripped Iran for a third straight day following a government-mandated fuel price increase of 50 percent and fuel rationing program introduced Nov. 15. Demonstrators protesting the price hikes have burned and looted more than 100 banks and shops across the country, barricaded highways and massed in the Grand Bazaar, a major cultural center in Tehran. Thus far, the government has responded by shutting down the country's internet and instituting violent crackdowns. </p>
      <p>Despite these protests, the largest and most widespread since the United States pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran and instituted a campaign of economic sanctions against the country, it's unlikely that the current round of demonstrations will threaten the continuity of the Iranian government. But the eventual fallout from the protests and the government's response could prove a seminal moment for Iran's post-sanctions strategy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>A Desperate Measure for a Desperate Time</b>
      </p>
      <p>The government's decision to boost fuel prices shows the degree of strain U.S. sanctions have put on the Iranian economy. Already, Iranian efforts to manage the large-scale protests in Lebanon and Iraq through its proxies and political influence have stretched its resources, and Tehran certainly anticipated that instituting the first fuel price increase since 2015 had the potential to spark protests. After all, when Tehran introduced a fuel rationing plan in 2007, riots followed. A 2017 proposal to increase fuel prices drew such opposition that it was not implemented. So given that its hands are already full in dealing with regional protest movements and the strong previous resistance to fuel price increases, it follows that Iran wouldn't have introduced the hike this week unless it was an absolute necessity. </p>
