      <h1>The rugby morning headlines as hurt Joe Schmidt reveals he may never return to rugby and Welsh region suffer heartbreak</h1>
      <h2>The latest rugby news from Wales and around the world on Saturday, November 23</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T09:59:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 09:59</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Doel</a></address>
      <p>Here are your rugby headlines on the morning of Saturday, November 23</p>
      <h4>Schmidt could walk away</h4>
      <p>Former Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has revealed he may never return to rugby coaching.</p>
      <p>Schmidt stepped down after Ireland's Rugby World Cup failure, bringing to an end a largely successful six-year reign.</p>
      <p>He announced he was leaving the Irish job prior to the World Cup to spend more time with his family and help look after his son who has epilepsy.</p>
      <p>But there's no doubt the manner of the bruising 46-14 World Cup quarter-final defeat to New Zealand and the pressure of being in charge of the national team have taken their toll.</p>
      <p>In an interview <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/11/22/joe-schmidt-considering-life-away-pressures-coaching-following/">with the Telegraph</a> to promote his new book, Schmidt revealed he had not taken a day off in more than six years and barely slept in Japan.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, I'm not sure I'll ever go back to coaching," he said.</p>
      <p>"I just don't know. I want to give myself a bit of distance. I'm emotionally attached. I do take it home with me. I do feel a sense of responsibility to the people who support us, the people who came out to Japan, the people whose hopes we maybe inspired. To let them down was… really tough."</p>
      <h4>England Six Nations blow</h4>
      <p>England have suffered a potential Six Nations blow after winger Joe Cokanasiga was ruled out for months with an unspecified knee injury he picked up at the World Cup.</p>
      <p>His club Bath released a vague statement, saying: “In order to provide Joe the best possible management plan and rehabilitation process, Bath Rugby’s medical department are enlisting the services of world-leading specialists to ensure expert opinion is considered to deliver an optimal path to recovery.</p>
      <p>“The club’s priority is to maximise his chances to perform at the very highest level.”</p>
      <p>Director of rugby Stuart Hooper added: “Joe is a phenomenal talent and a powerful athlete, and we must manage him very carefully in the coming months to allow for the issues he came back from Japan with to be resolved.”</p>

      <h4>Scarlets suffer heartbreak</h4>
      <p>The Scarlets were downed in heartbreaking fashion at the Stade Felix Mayol, losing 17-16 to Toulon in the European Challenge Cup.</p>
      <p>A 90th minute conversion from centre Anthony Belleau saw the hosts creep ahead by a point, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat in the last play.</p>
      <p>It was a remarkable performance from the Scarlets, who played the entire second half with 14 men following the sending off of Tevita Ratuva late in the opening period.</p>

      <h4>Greenwood loves Dan Biggar</h4>
      <p>TV pundit, Telegraph columnist and World Cup winner Will Greenwood has named Dan Biggar as one of his 10 standout players in the European Champions Cup so far this season.</p>
      <p>Biggar was at the heart of Northampton's opening weekend win over Lyon, stepping back into the breach just a fortnight after the Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>And, picking his top stars in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-union/2019/11/22/ten-standout-players-first-round-look-europe-weekend/">the Telegraph</a> , Greenwood wrote: "I had to pick out Biggar. I admire this lad immensely. Totally committed. A little 'wordy' with refs occasionally, perhaps one too many throws of the arms, but I live in a glass house so will not throw stones.</p>
      <p>"Truly brilliant goal-kicker, excellent reader of the game when defending and scrambling, so good in the air. And lovely distribution."</p>
