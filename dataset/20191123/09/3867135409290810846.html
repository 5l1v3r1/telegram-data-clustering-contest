      <p><b>What: </b>An oddity among plants, x Fatshedera lizei is a rare hybrid between Fatsia japonica and Hedera helix (English ivy), hence its nickname “botanical wonder.” This evergreen cannot decide whether to be a vine (like one parent) or a shrub (like the other). Branches sprout up but fall over after a while and crawl across the ground. These thin pliable branches can easily be tied and trained onto a support. Fatshedera produces shiny, dark green leaves of about 8 inches wide. In spring, the new growth is covered with a fine layer of rusty brown hairs, and if the plant is really flourishing, it will produce small clusters of white flowers in the fall. Don’t worry about seedlings, as this hybrid is completely sterile. This type of hybrid rarely occurs in nature, x Fatshedera was found in 1910 at a nursery in France. (The multiplication sign preceding the genus names indicates that it is a bigeneric hybrid.)</p>
      <p><b>Where:</b> This unusual evergreen plant prefers rich well-drained soil, but will tolerate sandy sites and clay if drainage is adequate.</p>
      <p><b>Size: </b>Fatshedera can grow to be 10 feet long when mature because one of the hybrid’s parents is a vine.</p>
      <p><b>Care: </b>Regular summer watering encourages full lush growth and bold leaves, but it will tolerate only occasional watering during dry weather. The best foliage is in open to deep shade with protection from hot sun. It requires little pruning to maintain its rambling open habit.</p>
