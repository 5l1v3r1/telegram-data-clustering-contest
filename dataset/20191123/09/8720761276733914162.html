      <p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/~Jeff+Archambeault">Jeff Archambeault</a> (Slashdot reader #41,488) writes: <i>Amateur Radio and computing worlds mourn the death of another pioneer. <br/><br/>From Phil Karn, KA9Q on the the 44Net mailing list:<br/><br/><i>I have very sad news. My good friend, <a href="https://photos.smugmug.com/photos/i-qRxpLrc/1/X4/i-qRxpLrc-X4.jpg">Brian Kantor</a>, WB6CYT suddenly passed away this week at his home in San Diego, California. Brian retired only two years ago after 47 years of service on the staff at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). Way back in the mid 1980s, Brian and I founded AMPRnet, the TCP/IP over amateur radio network. He continued to manage it until his passing. <br/><br/>Brian recently created and served as chair and CEO of <a href="https://www.ampr.org/">Amateur Radio Digital Communications (ARDC)</a>, a charitable foundation funded by the sale of unused AMPRnet IPv4 addresses. ARDC promotes STEM education and amateur radio digital development through scholarships and by funding the development of open source hardware and software. <br/><br/>Brian will be sorely missed and impossible to replace. Memorial arrangements will be announced when known.</i> </i><br/>Brian Rogers, N1URO, author of URONode packet software added:<br/><br/><i><i>Brian was an interesting yet friendly character unlike anything you'd imagine for someone of his status. He invented things such as eMail (smtp) and usenet (nntp) along with half of the VPN services of ipip. In doing so, he not only helped the amateur community world wide but also the general public globally. <br/><br/>One would think that he wouldn't be an approachable type of person however nothing could be farther from the truth. He was very approachable and would try to offer anyone a hand if he could. <br/><br/>The world has no idea who they're going to miss as someone of his statue is simply irreplace-able!</i></i></p>
