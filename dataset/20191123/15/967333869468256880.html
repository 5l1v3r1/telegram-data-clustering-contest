      <p>On Saturday, Taapsee Pannu addressed a session titled "Women in Lead" at the eight-day long International Film Festival of India (IFFI) going on in Panjim, Goa. </p>
      <p>The 32-year-old Bollywood-newbie appeared in her first commercial Hindi film titled "Chashme Baddoor" in 2013 directed by top comedy director David Dhawan. </p>
      <p>Even though the movie only managed to pull off a mediocre box office collection of $8.5 million (INR 59 crores), Taapsee's work was highly appreciated. That is when the actress was convinced of her potential in the movie business.</p>
      <p>"I realised that in commercial Hindi movies, the competition is fierce. My contemporaries are not only talented; they are also drop dead gorgeous. I was appreciated for Chashme Baddoor, but I wanted to do something more to leave an impact", Taapsee said.</p>
      <blockquote>The actress, who said she is very "black and white" in choices, soon shifted her line of work to feature in movies where she could act as a female protagonist and shone in movies like "Pink" and "Badla" (Revenge), while sharing screen time with the megastar of the millennium, Amitabh Bachchan. </blockquote>
      <p>The actress further played small, but significant parts in movies like "Mission Mangal" where Bollywood biggies including <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911021077205727-bollywood-megastar-akshay-kumar-gears-up-with-jet-suit-at-gravity-lab/">Akshay Kumar</a> and Vidya Balan were the main leads. </p>
      <p>According to media reports, Taapsee, who advocates pay parity in the film industry, receives a little less than one million dollars per movie.</p>
      <blockquote>The young actress believes female actresses in India still have to compromise on their fees if the male lead is a bigger star. "When it comes to pay-scale equality, we still have a long way to go", the actress added. </blockquote>
      <p>Talking about dream projects, Taapsee clearly said she is looking for a film where she could play a <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201910061076973226-i-think-i-am-a-great-superhero---priyanka-chopra-on-indian-marvel-superhero-film/">"superheroine".</a></p>
      <p>"I don't have a surname to protect. I am not answerable to a family, or a 20 year-long career. I have an edge, being an outsider, like I don't have that lineage to protect", the actress said at IFFI.</p>
      <p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of IFFI, which is considered the Asian-equivilant of the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
