        <b>Thousands rallied in Paris on Saturday to seek an end to gender violence and femicide in a country where at least 116 women have been killed by current or former partners this year, sparking national outrage.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The march began near the French capital's main opera house, with several protesters holding up placards bearing the image of a relative or friend killed in gender violence.</p>
      <p>"Break the silence, not women," read one sign. "Down with the patriarchy," read another.</p>
      <p>About 30 marches have been organised throughout France. They involve nearly 70 organisations, political parties, unions and associations.</p>
      <p>"We think this will be a historic march," Caroline De Haas, one of the organisers, said, adding that "the level of awareness is moving at breakneck speed."</p>
      <p>Central Paris was awash in a sea of purple -- the colour of the protesters.</p>
      <p>"We can no longer count the number of cases where femicides could have been avoided," the organisers said on Facebook Saturday.</p>
      <p>"With this march, we will make the public authorities take appropriate measures."</p>
      <p>The government is expected to announce about 40 measures on Monday to tackle the scourge.</p>
      <p>A total of 116 women have been murdered in France so far this year by their husband, partner or ex-partner, according to an AFP investigation.</p>
      <p>The group "Femicides by companions or ex" meanwhile puts the toll at 137.</p>
      <p>"In 32 femicides, it's Christmas," read one sign at the march.</p>
      <p>It shows the scale of the problem as 121 were killed in France last year, according to official figures.</p>
      <p>One woman is killed in France every three days by their partner or ex-partner, while marital violence affects 220,000 Frenchwomen every year.</p>
      <p>"Our system is not working to protect these women," Justice Minister Nicole Belloubet recently said.</p>
      <p>The killings in France are part of a global scourge that shows no signs of abating, with 87,000 women and girls killed in 2017 according to the UN -- over half of them killed either by their spouse, partner or own family.</p>
