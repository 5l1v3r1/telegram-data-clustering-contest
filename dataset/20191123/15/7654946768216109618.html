      <p>S’mores, skeet and schmoozing keep a political party together in the face of impeachment, President Trump has found.</p>
      <p>The White House is using weekends at Camp David to woo Republicans — and enforce party discipline — as the House Democrats try to kick him out of office, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and other top administration officials have hosted 40 House Republicans at the rustic presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains since the House impeachment effort began.</p>
      <p>The coveted invite is “the envy of the conference,” one member <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-opens-up-camp-david-as-an-adult-playground-to-woo-gop-lawmakers-during-impeachment/2019/11/22/ec6e7810-0c6f-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">told the Washington Post.</a></p>

      <p>“Who would want to go there?” he asked Mulvaney when the aide, a former congressman, broached the idea.</p>
