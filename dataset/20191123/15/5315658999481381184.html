      <h1>Breach of suppression order in Millane case</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:47:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Police" target="_blank">New Zealand Police</a></address>
      <p>"Breach of suppression order"</p>
      <p>Please attribute to Detective Inspector Scott Beard:</p>
      <p>Police have been made aware today that the defendant in the Grace Millane homicide has been named on social media accounts in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Although the homicide trial concluded yesterday, a suppression order which prevents naming the defendant remains in place and will do so until lifted by the court.</p>
      <p>While we appreciate the public feeling around this case, we do want to remind the public that it is an offence to breach a court order such as a name suppression - this includes naming someone on social media.</p>
      <p>ENDS</p>
