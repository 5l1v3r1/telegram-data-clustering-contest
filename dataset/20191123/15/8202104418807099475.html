      <h1>Cuthand: Hockey team important to Indigenous people</h1>

      <p>The people of Beardy's have welcomed hockey fans from the opposing teams to their arena and their reserve. Now this opportunity is gone.</p>

      <h3>For 25 years, the people of Beardy’s First Nation had a AAA midget hockey team that was a source of pride and entertainment. The team also proved to be a valuable hockey mill, turning out players for the junior, university and professional ranks.</h3>
      <p>Sadly, the team is in its last year. The Saskatchewan Hockey Association conducted a review of the league and <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/beardys-okemasis-cree-nation-devastated-after-vote-to-move-hockey-teams-from-community">dropped Beardy’s from the league</a>. The only other team affected was the Notre Dame Argos, but they have another midget team, so the damage is minimized.</p>
      <p>For Beardy’s and Indigenous hockey, the decision is devastating. The Beardy’s Blackhawks are the only First Nations-based AAA midget team in Canada. The team is a safe haven for young hockey players across the province.</p>
      <p>One example that was pointed out to me was a talented player from Black Lake, a Dene community in the province’s northeast corner, south of the Northwest Territories border. It’s doubtful that this young hockey player would have been given a chance on any other team. He had lots of raw talent, but because of his isolation, he was short of actual game experience.</p>
      <p>Indigenous players who have played on mainstream teams have been the targets of racism both on the ice and in the dressing room. Our people have a hard time when they are a small minority and subject to the will and racism of the majority.</p>
      <p>When my kids were in minor hockey in Saskatoon, we witnessed racism on the ice from rival players. <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/feature/life-hockey-and-lessons-learned">Some of the Aboriginal players on the team were talented and stood out.</a> Several times in the post-game handshake, some white kid would beak off at our guys and a fight might break out. Sometimes they would just skate away, but every so often they had enough.</p>
      <p>While I could see that the parents got after their kids, racism is a learned behaviour. Children pick up their parents’ bad habits at the dinner table, in the living room and at the arena.</p>
      <p>Every spring we would put together an all-native team to compete in the Western Canadian Native Hockey Championships tournament held in Saskatoon. We had a stress-free dressing room and the team pulled together, playing teams from the prairie provinces plus B.C. and the Northwest Territories. The competition was fierce and the best we could ever do was a silver and a bronze.</p>
      <p>The point I want to make is that our people enjoy each other’s company; it’s a safe harbour from the racial tension that occurs so often throughout society, whether it be a job site, the classroom or in sports.</p>
      <p>In the past, the old boarding schools turned out talented players, but only <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/saskatchewan/canada-150-fred-sasakamoose">Fred Sasakamoose made it to the NHL.</a> Today there are <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/sports/hockey/hockey-tournament-pays-homage-to-famed-indigenous-player-fred-sasakamoose">numerous Aboriginal players throughout the league and the number is growing steadily.</a></p>
      <p>This year the Beardy’s Blackhawks have been invited to the Mac’s AAA tournament held annually in Calgary. This is an international tournament that attracts teams from across Canada, the United States and Europe. In the SHA AAA midget league, the top five teams are selected to attend the tournament.</p>
      <p>In the past, the Blackhawks have made the cut and attended the tournament with as many parents attending as possible. One year they faced off against the Swiss national team and beat them. The parents were amazed that a bunch of reserve kids could hold their own against an international team, and the pride was obvious.</p>
      <p>The Blackhawks have been involved in reconciliation for 25 years. The team has played across the province and in the Mac’s tournament, and in the process they have been good ambassadors for our people.</p>
      <p>The people of Beardy’s have welcomed fans from the opposing teams to their arena and their reserve. Many people who had never set foot on a reserve because of fear or lack of opportunity have benefited from the experience of meeting our people on their home turf.</p>
      <p>Now this opportunity is gone. Next season the rink will be quiet and the AAA level midget players will either be with other teams or not playing the game they love.</p>
