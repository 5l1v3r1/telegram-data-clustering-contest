      <p>I remember liking this when I was younger, and now I’m watching it again as an adult – it’s super cool. It’s an animated show about a 12-year-old kid who’s the last of his kind; he has to master each of the elements to take down the Fire Nation, who are the villains. He travels on a bison, and there’s a blind girl called Toph who can feel vibrations, so she knows where she’s going – she’s probably my favourite. It’s a nice watch: they drop in so many little life gems that when I was younger I probably didn’t really take in.</p>
      <h3>2. Album<br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/03/michael-kiwanuka-kiwanuka-review">Michael Kiwanuka – Kiwanuka</a></h3>

      <p>Michael is very, very talented, and I’ve loved all his music prior to this record. He was already on such a level before, and he’s levelled up again: this album sounds like an evolved Michael. I love the sound, how raw it is, the production, the writing. The videos have been really cool. I think it’s an important record and will do really well. My favourite song on there would probably be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivvs_qL6t_c">You Ain’t the Problem</a> – I like the melody, the backing vocals. It’s a really well-put-together song.</p>

      <h3>3. Book<br/>Simbi and the Satyr of the Dark Jungle (1955) by Amos Tutuola</h3>
      <p>I’m about to start reading this. I’m from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria">Nigeria</a> – my cousin went there, went into a book store, and she found a book that had my name on it and sent me a picture of it. So I researched it, and it turns out it’s about a girl in the 50s, trying to become a singer and live her dream. I only knew that she had my name, Simbi, so I don’t know what it’s about really, but I thought it would be a cool read.</p>
      <h3>4. Gig<br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/11/new-band-of-the-week-khruangbin-no-70">Khruangbin</a></h3>

      <p>I played a show the other day in Chile, and Khruangbin were on after me. I’ve been a fan for a while, but this was the first time I got to see them live and I was blown away. They’re a three-piece band from Texas – guy on guitar, girl on bass, another guy on drums – and I was super impressed by the chemistry between them, and how simple but effective their show was. They make alternative music with elements of soul, indie and jazz, very instrumental. It was incredible. They’re playing London in December so I’m going to go see them again when I get home.</p>
      <h3>5. App<br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/aug/27/luis-von-ahn-ceo-duolingo-interview">Duolingo</a></h3>

      <p>I don’t really download apps or games to be honest, but I’m trying to learn German so I’ve been on Duolingo every day, trying to take in as much as possible. It’s a sick app – it breaks it down and teaches you the basics. It’s cool that you can learn a language just like that. I really love Berlin and often find myself going out there if I’ve got a weekend off, so I figured I might as well try and learn a bit of the language. German’s really difficult, but I’m trying, so let’s see how that goes.</p>

      <p>I’m in Brazil right now, and I went to this really nice Japanese restaurant in São Paulo. I had it the first night I got here – a bunch of us went out and got some food. Japanese is becoming one of my favourite cuisines: the food just tastes really fresh and healthy. The restaurant had a really nice vibe: very modern, low lighting. The miso soup was banging. Everything was great, but that miso soup – whatever they put in that, they need to keep putting it in there.</p>
