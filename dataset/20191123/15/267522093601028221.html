      <p>It was only announced a few months ago, but it's already clear the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 is one of the best smartwatches in the world right now, but if you still need persuading to buy one, now is the time to give in.</p>
      <p>John Lewis currently has a mega Black Friday deal right now, offering a useful £30 off the premium smartwatch.</p>

      <p>There is so much to like about the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2. The design is sleek, futuristic, and streamlined, and comes in 44mm and 40mm sizes. </p>
      <p>Of course, the Samsung Galaxy Watch can do everything you'd expect a smartwatch to do, from receiving notifications and calls right on your wrist, to fitness tracking.</p>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active2 is capable of Blood Pressure Monitoring (like the original), but the second generation is also able to take an ECG reading. </p>
      <p>This really is the smartwatch to beat if you're using an Android phone.</p>
