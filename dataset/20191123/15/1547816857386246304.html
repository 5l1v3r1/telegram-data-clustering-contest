        <b>Avid viewers of Bigg Boss 13 believe that Salman Khan is biased towards Shehnaaz Gill in the house and favours her a lot. So we spoke to her father Santokh Singh Sukh who had a slightly different viewpoint towards it</b>
      </p>
      <p>In each season of Bigg Boss, the audiences pick 1-2 contestants and call them as Salman Khan’s favourite on the basis of whom he supports amongst the inmates. This time, Shehnaaz Gill is being touted as Bhai ki favourite contestant whom he supports a lot in comparison to the rest.</p>
      <p>The social media has been abuzz about how the star is biased towards Shehnaaz, however, her father doesn’t agree that Salman is purposely favouring his daughter.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to SpotboyE.com, Santokh Singh Sukh says, "Shehnaaz fans will definitely praise the fact that Salman likes her whereas the ones who are not her fans will call it as biased behaviour. Shehnaaz is very innocent and that has won Salman's heart. I remember when she walked on Bigg Boss 13 stage, no script was given to her. Her song was being played and she spontaneously broke into a dance which impressed him. And I think that's why he sides my daughter as she is extremely entertaining.” </p>

      <p>Talking about Shehnaaz calling herself Punjab Ki Katrina, her father says, "When she was in school, she used to call herself as Katrina Kaif. She was very active in dance and drama on-stage since then and people used to say she looks like Katrina. So, she started saying ‘Main Punjab Ki Katrina Kaif Hoon’.”</p>
