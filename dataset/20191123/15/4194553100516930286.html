      <h1>(Video) ‘If that was Salah or Mane…’ Some Reds claim Harry Kane’s ludicrous Spurs dive proves media hypocrisy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:16:26+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Harry Kane dived as Jose Mourinho got his first win as the new Tottenham boss this afternoon, as Spurs beat West Ham United 2-3 at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>The England forward has a history of throwing himself to the ground easily, though many Reds supporters were quick to point out that had it been one of Sadio Mane or Mo Salah, the reaction from the media and the wider public might have been a little different.</p>
      <p>The clip below shows an example of Kane jumping up in the air to exaggerate the contact, courtesy of BT Sport’s footage.</p>
      <blockquote>Hilarious dive by Kane here. Basically gets hugged from behind and falls on his ass. Literally makes no sense but 🤷‍♂️😂 <a href="https://t.co/s4IAWL9lW1">pic.twitter.com/s4IAWL9lW1<br/></a>— D-Gooner (@goonerderrick) <a href="https://twitter.com/goonerderrick/status/1198251452365516801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>This is how some Reds fans – and a few West Ham ones too – took to Twitter to make a similar point.</p>
      <blockquote>Harry Kane diving whilst simultaneously trying to give Snodgrass a Stone Cold Stunner will get zero attention on MOTD tonight.<br/>If it was Salah or Mané, Alan Shearer would be “what IS he doing? That’s dangerous cheating!!”<br/>— Biggies MaIIs VOTE LABOUR (@MoMoneyMoSaIah) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoMoneyMoSaIah/status/1198250459435327488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Harry Kane needs to stop getting so much protection from referees and the media. If salah or zaha was rolling around the way he did today they would’ve been slaughtered<br/>— TB (@WhuTommy) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhuTommy/status/1198255428364316672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>If that fall from harry Kane was Salah, the streets would have been lit by now and a whole 1 hour reserved for his discussion!!!<br/>— HASSANNOOR IBRAHIM HARUN 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 (@hassannur06) <a href="https://twitter.com/hassannur06/status/1198249857942786049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>People say Salah dive, and Harry Kane doesn't. People also say Trump is innocent. <a href="https://t.co/MnVN2vjIEC">pic.twitter.com/MnVN2vjIEC<br/></a>— That Firmino Smile (@MichiganLfc) <a href="https://twitter.com/MichiganLfc/status/1198244518623137792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Hopefully, the Reds get the job done at Crystal Palace without any controversy this afternoon. Otherwise, this topic is going to be dragged up once again.</p>
