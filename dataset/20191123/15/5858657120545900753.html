      <p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A major Michigan liquor distributor is taking heat for delays in getting booze to customers.</p>
      <p>Republic National Distributing acknowledges the problems and says it may take many more days to fix things. Joe Gigliotti says there’s no liquor shortage — it’s all in the warehouse.</p>
      <p>The distributor consolidated operations in Livonia, causing problems for months. Gigliotti told state regulators Friday that it “seemed to overload the system.”</p>
      <p>Liquor Control Commission Chairman Pat Gagliardi says the problems show what can happen when a distributor has a large share of the market. Some retailers have driven to the warehouse to get their liquor.</p>
      <p>The commission has logged more than 800 complaints in November. Steve Soka of Franklin Liquor &amp; Deli in Southfield says the holidays are a critical time to sell liquor.</p>
