      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> would be a "perfect" signing for new Tottenham Hotspur boss Jose Mourinho, says former Spurs striker Darren Bent.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> ace has already been linked with a move to Mourinho's former club Manchester United because of his impressive performances in the Premier League so far this season.</p>
      <p>And Bent thinks Mourinho "would love" having McGinn in his ranks at Tottenham, having replaced Mauricio Pochettino, because of the Scotland international's attacking threat and work-rate.</p>
      <p>“I get it, the temptation is hard, you never know, someone like Mourinho, McGinn would be perfect for Mourinho," Bent told Football Insider.</p>
      <p>"He’s the type of player that creates and he works really, really hard.</p>
      <p>“Mourinho would love someone like him, that McGinn, Mourinho would love him.”</p>
