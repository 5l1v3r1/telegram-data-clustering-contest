      <h1>Kodak Black appeals against 4-year weapons sentence after being ‘drugged’ in jail</h1>
      <h2>Rapper Kodak Black was sentenced to 46-months in prison on federal gun charges last week</h2>

      <p>Kodak Black has launched an appeal against his nearly four-year sentence for weapons offences after being “drugged” in jail.</p>
      <p>The rapper was sentenced to 46-months in prison on federal gun charges last week.</p>
      <p>While in custody awaiting his sentencing, he was reportedly involved in a jail fight that resulted in an officer being hospitalised after having his testicles grabbed, but the rapper has claimed he was drugged leading up to the altercation.</p>
      <p>Now the 22-year-old is appealing his nearly four-year sentence, after previously filing a motion to be relocated in a facility that offers the Residential Drug Abuse Program - a voluntary program for prisoners with a history of substance abuse.</p>

      <p>The Assistant United States Attorney Bruce Brown reportedly claimed that Kodak would benefit from this program during his sentencing last week. If approved, the Florida rapper would spend a portion of his sentence in rehab.</p>
      <p>Kodak’s legal team appealed his sentence yesterday with a document reading: "Notice is hereby given that the Defendant, Bill K. Kapri, takes and enters this, his Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to review the Orders, Judgment and Sentence entered on November 13, 2019.”</p>
      <p>Black was sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison after pleading guilty to weapons charges stemming from his arrest just before a scheduled concert performance at the Rolling Loud hip-hop festival in May.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old rapper admitted in August that he falsified information on federal forms to buy four firearms from a Miami-area gun shop on two separate occasions.</p>

      <p>Black was able to obtain three of the weapons: a 9mm handgun, a .380-calibre handgun and a semi-automatic Mini Draco weapon.</p>
      <p>Police said one of the guns was found at the scene of a March shooting in Pompano Beach, although he has not been charged in that case.</p>
      <p>Black also faces drug, weapons and sexual assault charges in other states that remain pending.</p>
      <p>US District Judge Federico Moreno could have sentenced Black to the maximum of 10 years, and prosecutors wanted eight years in part because Black allegedly was involved in a jail fight that injured a corrections officer.</p>
      <p>“I think it's time for us to give some tough love in this case,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Brown. “I just don't see how and when he’s taken these things seriously.”</p>

      <p>But Moreno noted that Black has given money anonymously to charitable causes and could continue to do so behind bars.</p>
      <p>“My suggestion would be you continue to be generous,” the judge said.</p>
      <p>Shortly after sentencing the star posted a selfie clad in his prison uniform on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Seeming to suggest he was still in control, the rapper captioned the post: “Hold It Down While I’m On Lock. Calling Shots From The Box #Literally.”</p>
      <p>The “Calling My Spirit” artist is planing on earning his degree while behind bars.</p>
      <p>Black is a Florida native who was born to Haitian American parents as Dieuson Octave and who now goes by the legal name of Bill Kapri.</p>
      <p>“I have made some decisions I’m not proud of making,” Black said in court. “I do take full responsibility for my mishap.”</p>
      <p>Black's better-known singles include Skrt, Zeze, Roll in Peace, Tunnel Vision, and No Flockin.</p>
