      <h1>New Faces New Places: Electrician ready to upgrade your house with home automation</h1>

      <p>"It's also really efficient. When I drive away from my house the geolocation notices that I've left and turns all the lights that are on a smart switch off, so I don't have to spend precious minutes running around turning off every switch."</p>

      <h3>Anne-Marie Howie had her doubters when she decided to open up shop as an independent electrician, but after more than a decade working for others she decided it was time to do things her way.</h3>
      <p>“I found that I really did miss doing my own thing, my own way, and making my customers happy while not answering to someone else,” she said.</p>
      <p>“This way, I know I’m doing higher quality work, using better materials … I was at the mercy of whatever (my previous employers) chose and a lot of the time I was just like, ‘No, this isn’t quality product.’ And I am the type of person that if I can’t point at something and be proud to say ‘I did that,’ then I may as well not even do it.”</p>
      <p>The journeyman electrician has been so busy she has taken on an apprentice to help manage the workload. At the same time, being her own boss allows her freedom away from the job.</p>
      <p>“Being able to have that flexibility to spend time with my daughter, or once a month going to this parent and talk group … it’s important to me,” she said.</p>
      <p>Howie has the skills to work on any task expected from an electrician, but she specializes in home automation — from self-opening and self-closing blinds to lights that automatically switch off once the cellphone GPS recognizes the owner has left the house.</p>
      <p>“It’s a niche, and honestly just a lot of fun,” Howie said.</p>
      <p>“It’s also really efficient. When I drive away from my house the geolocation notices that I’ve left and turns all the lights that are on a smart switch off, so I don’t have to spend precious minutes running around turning off every switch.”</p>
      <p>Opting to automate also gives homeowners peace of mind when away from home. Switches can be flicked on and off using an app. Mobile notifications and a video feed are available whenever someone rings the doorbell. Lights can be set to turn on and off at random intervals while homeowners are on vacation.</p>
      <p>Howie experiments with all the newest tech at her own home, utilizing Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa. She lives in a space where, with only her voice, she can do everything from change the colour of the lighting in her home to starting and stopping movies. She even has a schedule to help get her daughter organized and off to school with as few interruptions as possible.</p>
      <p>“It turns her light on every morning and then 10 minutes before daycare time it tells her to put on her shoes and also turns off the TV,” Howie said with a laugh.</p>
      <p>“Now, instead of her slowly walking to the door, staring at the TV, it just turns off and she goes to get ready.”</p>
      <p>Any kind of electrical job — big or small, home automation or simply installing new lights or outlets — can be booked by phoning or emailing Howie, or by using her Essential Power Facebook page and choosing a date and time.</p>
      <p>“Our motto is ‘We light up your life,’ and that’s exactly what we are here to do,” Howie said.</p>
      <p>“After 13 years of being in the trade I still love what I do and I just want to continue on making people’s renovation dreams come true.”</p>
