        <b>LaLiga</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Result:</b> Leganes 1-2 FC Barcelona</p>
      <p><b>Date:</b> 23 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Estadio Municipal de Butarque</p>
      <p>A star-studded FC Barcelona side produced a less than convincing display after rallying from behind to defeat struggling Leganes on Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde went for a very attacking line-up as Messi was joined in the attack by Luis Suarez, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele, while there was a first start for Senegal international Moussa Wague.</p>
      <p>However, it was the home side who got the game's first goal thanks to Youssef En-Nesyri, who collected a pass from Roque Mesa before rifling the ball into the top corner, leaving Marc-Andre ter Stegen with no chance.</p>
      <p>The Catalan giants upped the tempo in search of an equaliser, but there met by Leganes shot-stopper Ivan Cuellar, who produced a couple superb saves to keep out Suarez on two occasions after the 25-minute mark.</p>
      <p>Leganes, meanwhile, did not sit back though as they went in search of another goal, although En-Nesyri and Mesa went close in the final seven minutes of the first half.</p>
      <p>Barca came out firing in the second half and were rewarded with the equaliser when Messi's free-kick found Suarez, who nodded past Cuellar from six-yards out.</p>
      <p>With the visitors chasing the game, Ernesto Valverde surprisingly took of Griezmann for Arturo Vidal, while Sergio Busquets made way for Ivan Rakitic with 30 minutes remaining in the contest.</p>
      <p>Leganes managed to carve out a couple openings against the run of play, with Silva going closest with a header that sailed inches wide of the upright while Perez produced a vital block at the other end to deny Rakitic on 71 minutes.</p>
      <p>The comeback was completed with 10 minutes remaining in the second half when Vidal found the back of the net with a neat finish from close-range, with the Video Assistant Referee approving the goal.</p>
      <p>Barcelona will hope that Real Madrid fail to beat Real Sociedad by three goals if they want to maintain top spot in LaLiga this evening.</p>
