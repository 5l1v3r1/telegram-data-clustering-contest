      <p>The annual Handbags for Hope project is back in Keremeos, looking for donations from the community to help women in need. </p>
      <p>Organized by the ladies of the Keremeos Royal Purple, the campaign is looking for new or gently used large purses and/or toiletries, all of which will be donated to needy women in Keremeos, Ollala, Cawston and Hedley. </p>
      <p>Last year, they packed 43 handbags full of items for distribution. </p>
      <p>Donations can be dropped off at the Valley First Credit Union in Keremeos until Nov. 29.</p>
