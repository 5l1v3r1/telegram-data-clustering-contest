          </p>
          <p>With both Barcelona and Real Madrid being in topsy-turvy form in the ongoing edition of La Liga with inconsistency riddling both the sides, this season of the league looks to be wide open one. What it also does is make each encounter extremely pivotal for both the sides with the slightest of slip ups proving to be calamitous given the extremely close contested title fight both find themselves embroiled in at the moment.</p>
          <p>Level on 25 points after 13 gameweeks, Real Madrid ended up capitalising on Barcelona’s defeat to Levante with a 4-0 routing of Eibar to go into the break just short of Barcelona by the barest of margins with only goal difference separating the two outfits. Although the side have won only three of their previous five encounters, what works in their favour is the fact that they have managed to squirm their way to four draws, managing to scrape and scram the bare minimum from those matches.</p>

                <p>When they go out in pursuit of top spot today, Real Madrid know that things will be far from easy as they strive to register their second win on the bounce. They are up against a ruthless, exceptional and relentless attacking unit in the form of Real Sociedad, a side which will come hot out of the blocks in this one.</p>
                <p>Currently in fifth place, Real Sociedad missed a pristine chance to move level on points with Real Madrid the last time around as they drew 1-1 with Leganes in a performance which the side haven’t been associated with in this edition of the league. They’ll be looking to overturn it come today and try to obliterated a vulnerable Real Madrid side which has fallen down infront of succulent attacking displays. </p>

                              <b>Real Madrid </b>

                            <h3>Top Scorer</h3>
                            <p>
                              <b>Real Madrid </b>
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Karim Benzema: 9 Goals, 3 Assists</li>
                            </ul>

                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>RM Vs RS Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Real Sociedad’s Alex Remiro is opted by us to represent our side in this unit of our Dream 11 setup. His side have gone onto concede 14 times and when they play at Real Madrid’s home today, the likelihood of them conceding is way too way with the side set to be battered and rattled by a hoard of shots.</p>
                            <p>And what lead us their shot stopper’s way despite the side set to miss out on a cleansheet today is the fact that he will be coming across a carnage, one that will allow him to show his resolve and amass some good save points. </p>
                            <h3>RM Vs RS Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>With these two sides being two of the best attacking units in the league, having tallied up a stellar and stunning 46 goals in between them, there s a very bleak proposition of either being restrained from scoring. We expect this to be an extradonaire goal scoring encounter, seeing us pick out defensive picks solely on their attacking acumen.</p>
                            <p>It leads us towards a trivalent from Real Madrid with us brining in their fullback Dani Carvajal and CBs Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane. Ramos in particular is someone we envision manoeuvring his way to a goal or assist today with the player’s affinity to adamantly keep moving up the park paying rewards for him in terms of goal scoring opportunities.</p>
                            <h3>RM Vs RS Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Ever since sealing his dream move to Real Madrid, things have gone downward for Real Madrid’s Eden Hazard. The player was set to regale everyone in his electric performances, ones which have been well documented to see him become the player he is today but the player has failed to live upto his moniker completely.</p>
                            <p>He’s started reviving his season though in the last couple of matches with glimpses of his brilliance coming to the fore and with us well aware of what he’s capable of, the player is reposed faith by us for this one. Elsewhere from the opposition we have opted for a trio of picks given the way these three have moved in tandem to revel us in resplendent performances, ones which have infringed defences to make for a gripping narrative.</p>
                            <p>It sees us earmark Portu, Mikel Merino and Igor Zubeldia from the home side for this mending encounter.</p>
                            <h3>RM Vs RS Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>Real Madrid’s leading goal scorer with the 7 goals and 2 assists is the first player to be brought into our side with Rodrygo Goes being his partner for the day for this encounter. From the opposition meanwhile we get in their leading goal scorer as well with us venturing in with Willian Jose, someone who se five goals were enough to point us towards his selection for the day.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Goes will be our side’s captain for this imminent tie whilst Benzema is being made the vice-captain.</p>
