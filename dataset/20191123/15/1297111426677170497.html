      <h2>The Regina Pats haven't given up on top prospects Ty Smilanic and Daniil Gushchin, both of whom are expected to be high picks in the 2020 NHL draft.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:00:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/gregharderlp" target="_blank">Greg Harder</a></address>
      <p>The Regina Pats are staying the course despite another setback in their pursuit of blue-chip forward Ty Smilanic.</p>
      <p>The Quinnipiac University Bobcats announced Wednesday that Smilanic has committed to their program in Hamden, Conn., for the 2020-21 season. That’s an obvious blow to the Pats, who hold Smilanic’s WHL rights and still hope to recruit him.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old Denver product is currently in his final season with the U.S. national development program.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s great news but it’s still not out of the question (that he comes to Regina),” said Pats GM John Paddock, who exchanged text messages with Smilanic’s agent after hearing the news about Quinnipiac. “He said it was (the player’s) choice. At this point he’s committed to go there. With young kids, that can change. An NHL team can change that plan if they really feel it’s beneficial.”</p>
      <p>It’s not a surprise that the NCAA is a preferred route for Smilanic, who was headed for the University of Denver prior to being de-committed last year.</p>
      <p>Regina was always at a disadvantage given the inherent pressure for top American prospects to remain south of the border.</p>
      <p>However, the Pats felt good about their discussions with the family after picking Smilanic in the third round of the 2017 bantam draft. They <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/smilanic-departs-after-great-experience-with-pats">were even more optimistic when he attended training camp just four months later</a>.</p>
      <p>Although he considered signing at the time, Smilanic ultimately decided to explore his options.</p>
      <p>When he made a subsequent two-year commitment to Team USA, the Pats knew their best chance of recruiting Smilanic would come next fall.</p>
      <p>Despite his intention to play at Quinnipiac, there’s still a chance — likely a remote one — that he’ll be drafted by an NHL team that’s prepared to send him in their direction.</p>
      <p>“That’s the final step,” said Paddock, a former NHL GM who’s hopeful but skeptical about a third-party intervention. “NHL organizations are sort of non-committal. If they really feel that things are not good in one place or another, I think they would expedite that (move), but they seem to want to remain neutral … unless there’s really a red flag somewhere.”</p>
      <p>Regina has nothing to lose by remaining patient with Smilanic, who’s a top prospect for the 2020 NHL draft. He hasn’t played much this season due to mono, recording two goals and two assists in just two games.</p>
      <p>The Pats are also in a wait-and-see mode with forward Daniil Gushchin, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-add-highly-touted-russian-sniper-daniil-gushchin-in-chl-import-draft">who was taken seventh overall in the 2019 CHL import draft</a>. He’s in his second season with the USHL’s Muskegon Lumberjacks, recording eight goals and 15 points in 13 games after a slow start.</p>
      <p>Paddock met with Gushchin’s agent this fall. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/hockey/regina-pats/regina-pats-not-giving-up-on-top-russian-prospect-daniil-gushchin">Their correspondence suggested that the Russian sniper wasn’t ready to make the move right now, but the door could be open down the road</a>.</p>
      <p>Gushchin is expected to be a high pick in the 2020 draft — Central Scouting rates him a ‘B’ prospect (Rounds 2-3). Smilanic received an ‘A’ grade (first round).</p>
      <p>In both cases, the Pats will stay in touch with the hope that something changes after the draft.</p>
      <p>“We’re not changing (Smilanic’s) mind right now; we might not be able to change his mind, period,” admitted Paddock, who nonetheless maintains that the best and shortest route to the NHL is through Regina. “If (he’s drafted by) a team that, in their mind, it’s better for him to get into this kind of environment, then they can say that. But it remains to be seen.”</p>
