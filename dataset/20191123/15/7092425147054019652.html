      <p>A dog owner has tragically died after being infected with a rare bacterial disease as a result of his pet licking him.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old developed gangrene and broke out in blisters following contact with the dog's saliva which had a deadly bacteria called Capnocytophaga canimorus present.</p>
      <p>Extremely rare, the bacteria is more commonly transmitted through bites, however, in some cases it can also be passed on by a lick.</p>
      <p>As a result, the man spent over two weeks in hospital fighting a string of different health conditions including pneumonia, gangrene and a fever of 41C.</p>
      <p>When he first went to hospital he only had flu-like symptoms for three days, a fever and difficulty with breathing.</p>
      <p>In the first four days his condition rapidly decreased, beginning with a rash on his face and nerve pains in his legs.</p>
      <p>By the time the man started medical treatment he already had severe sepsis according to doctors. He required intensive care in an effort to save his life.</p>
      <p>As his condition got worse, the infection spread to his kidneys and resulted in his liver shutting down with blood clotting in his blood vessels, starting to rot his skin away.</p>
      <p>The conditions then led to cardiac arrest but the man was later resuscitated only to be put on life support thereafter.</p>
      <p>Scans of his brain revealed he had a massive build up of fluid in his brain, causing major damage to the organ.</p>
      <p>While this was happening, as well as multiple organs failing, doctors and his family thought it best to end his suffering and stop the the life support machine keeping him alive.</p>
      <p>Sadly, the man died 16 days after being admitted to hospital. His case was reported in a <a href="https://www.ejcrim.com/index.php/EJCRIM/article/view/1268">medical journal</a>Â by doctors from the Rote Kreuz Krankenhausin in Bremen, Germany.</p>
