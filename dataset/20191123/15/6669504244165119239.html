      <p>LONDON - Britain’s Prince Andrew continues to face many hurdles despite his decision to step down from royal duties because of his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old prince who is Queen Elizabeth II’s son is struggling to stay at the helm of his Pitch&amp;Palace charity, with some British media reports indicating he has already stepped down.</p>
      <p>A number of the charity’s corporate backers including Barclays have stopped supporting the project.</p>
      <p>Andrew faces continued scrutiny expected to intensify when a BBC interview with his primary accuser is broadcast.</p>
      <p>The broadcast with Virginia Giuffre is set for Dec. 2. She says she had sex with Andrew three times, starting when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Andrew denies the accusation. Epstein died in prison in August in what was ruled a suicide.</p>
