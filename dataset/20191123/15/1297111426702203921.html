      <h1>Rob Vanstone: Winnipeg Blue Bombers' Zach Collaros has silenced the skeptics</h1>
      <h2>After being widely written off, Zach Collaros has written quite a comeback story with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</h2>

      <p>Not that long ago, much of the discussion about <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/saskatchewan-roughriders-wish-the-best-for-zach-collaros-except-on-sunday">Zach Collaros</a> focused on grey matter, not the Grey Cup.</p>
      <p>The oft-concussed quarterback was urged to retire from football by alleged experts who opined that he was too susceptible to brain injuries.</p>
      <p>He was the porcelain passer — a label that was attached by this skeptical scribe — and any return to the gridiron was guaranteed to be abbreviated, with possible long-term consequences.</p>
      <p>So there he is, back on the field, preparing to start at quarterback for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in Sunday’s CFL championship game.</p>
      <p>If Collaros’s passes are as accurate as my predictions regarding his future, some lucky fan in Section Q, Row 23 of Calgary’s McMahon Stadium will take home a genuine, game-used Grey Cup football.</p>
      <p>Seldom, if ever, have I been so wrong about a quarterback.</p>
      <p>And, once upon a time, I believed in Joe (747) Adams.</p>
      <p>Following the 2018 season, which Collaros spent with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, I suggested that it was time for the Green and White to find a different quarterback.</p>
      <p>Groom a young passer.</p>
      <p>Bring back Kevin Glenn.</p>
      <p>Sign anyone named Kevin or Glenn.</p>
      <p>Jon Ryan’s in town? Punt on first down!</p>
      <p>It was as simple as ABC — Anyone But Collaros.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the Roughriders re-signed Collaros on Day 1 of the free-agency period, following an unsuccessful attempt to woo Bo Levi Mitchell away from the Calgary Stampeders.</p>
      <p>And there was outrage!</p>
      <p>How could the Roughriders do such a thing?!</p>
      <p>Yes, Saskatchewan did sport a 10-4 record in games started by Collaros, but those victories were primarily defence-driven. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/rob-vanstone-zach-collaros-demonstrates-that-statistics-can-be-deceiving">I did the math. The numbers would never lie.</a></p>
      <p>The “I told you so” chorus was in robust voice after Collaros was again concussed, only three plays into the Roughriders’ regular-season opener.</p>
      <p>Surely, that would be it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-cannot-allow-oft-concussed-zach-collaros-to-play-again">No right-thinking doctor would allow Collaros to continue playing</a> — not with his history of concussions.</p>
      <p>Monetary incentives aside, why would he even want to play again? There were, of course, the next 60 or 70 years to consider.</p>
      <p>The Roughriders found a successor to Collaros in the name of <a href="https://leaderpost.com/sports/football/cfl/saskatchewan-roughriders/rob-vanstone-saskatchewan-roughriders-quarterback-cody-fajardo-didnt-let-anyone-down">Cody Fajardo</a>, who quickly emerged as a franchise quarterback. Collaros was rendered expendable.</p>
      <p>The Toronto Argonauts actually surrendered (donated?) a conditional fourth-round draft pick while acquiring Collaros from Saskatchewan on July 31.</p>
      <p>As an Argonaut, the pride of Steubenville, Ohio became American Idle.</p>
      <p>He never played a down for the downtrodden Boatmen.</p>
      <p>Even so, there was a market for the 31-year-old quarterback’s services. Shortly before the Oct. 9 trade deadline, he was again on the move, to Winnipeg.</p>
      <p>Again, there was skepticism, and outright fear. What if the Blue Bombers actually used him? Consider the risks!</p>
      <p>The word “dangerous” does indeed apply. It describes the Bombers’ downfield passing attack with Collaros at the controls.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg has won all three of its games with Collaros behind centre.</p>
      <p>The first two victories were at the expense of the perennially powerful Stampeders, who fell 35-14 to the visiting Blue Bombers in the West semi-final.</p>
      <p>Then came last Sunday’s division final at Mosaic Stadium, where Collaros threw for 267 yards to help Winnipeg win 20-13.</p>
      <p>Along the way, he had completions for gains of 63 (by Darvin Adams), 42 (Nic Demski), 34 (Drew Wolitarsky) and 26 (a touchdown by Kenny Lawler, who caught the ball 10 yards deep in the end zone).</p>
      <p>Collaros also demonstrated impressive arm strength with 4 1/2 minutes left. He launched a rocket toward Adams, who was slightly overthrown on a pass that travelled 51 yards beyond the line of scrimmage.</p>
      <p>It must have been especially sweet for Collaros to punch a Grey Cup ticket in Regina, of all places.</p>
      <p>In keeping with his reputation as a guarded interviewee, Collaros never made a big deal (or even a small deal) about helping to bounce his former team from the playoffs.</p>
      <p>After dealing with a legion of naysayers and faux physicians — I know a guy who knows a guy whose disinherited second cousin once worked at a walk-in clinic — Collaros had every reason to thumb his nose at everyone who had dissed and dismissed him, only to be proven so dreadfully wrong.</p>
      <p>It was all of us, as it turned out, who needed our heads examined.</p>
