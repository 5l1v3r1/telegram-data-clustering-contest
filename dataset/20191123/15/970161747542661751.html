      <h1>Mourinho breathes new life into Spurs as reinvigorated Alli runs riot</h1>

      <p>After a whirlwind week that started with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> but will end with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a>, there was a palpable sense of relief among the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> players at the London Stadium that the focus had shifted back to on-field matters.</p>
      <p>For a club so prone to upheavel during the early years of Daniel Levy’s tenure, Pochettino’s reign brought a welcomed calmness for players and supporters alike but that script was ripped up this week as the club turned to Mourinho, a manager that guarantees drama above and before anything else.</p>
      <p>The manner of Mourinho’s exit from <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and indeed Chelsea before that means there’s valid question marks over his capabilities but there was enough evidence on display against West Ham to suggest he retains some of the man-management that once made him the most coveted manager in world football</p>

      <p>Mourinho was only afforded three training sessions with the group before his side’s trip to the London Stadium, meaning any tactical changes would be tweaks rather than grand overhauls. Even then, there’s simply not been enough time for him to imprint his tactical vision on a Spurs side that have heard the same voices for the last five-and-a-half seasons.</p>

      <p>But even small changes can make a difference and the evidence of that was all too apparent in Deli Alli’s performance. Alli’s been a shadow of his former self in the last 18 months as he moved deeper into midfield, further away from goal and further still from the player that made him one of the most exciting talents in world football.</p>
      <p>As Spurs fans pored over every piece of footage from Mourinho’s first 72 hours at the club, there was evidence of a marked difference in his approach to certain players. His first encounter with Heung-Min Son, for example, was soft and friendly. There was an arm around the shoulder for the South Korean, who was one of the few players who didn’t allow his performance level to dip too far below the required standard in Pochettino’s final days at the club.</p>

      <p>That was in stark contrast to Mourinho’s approach to Alli. A clip circulated of Mourinho boisteriously slapping Alli on the chest in training and it was clear from his first press conference that the Portuguese was already working on getting inside the midfielder’s head.</p>

      <p>‘I asked him if he was Dele or Dele’s brother,’ said Mourinho. ‘He told me he was Dele. ‘OK,’ I said. ‘”Play like Dele.”‘</p>
      <p>It didn’t take long at the London Stadium to realise Mourinho’s words had had the desired effect. Setting-up in his favoured 4-2-3-1 formation, Alli was given a role behind Harry Kane with genuine pace in Lucas Moura and Son on the flanks.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was finding pockets of space behind West Ham’s midfield and in front of a defence that was dropping ever deeper to protect the vulnerable Roberto. In a first half of few chances, one eventually came in the 36th minute when Alli picked the ball up on the half-turn and played in Son down the left channel. The forward neatly created space with a couple of stepovers before firing a left-footed strike through Roberto.</p>

      <p>Toby Alderweireld won a one-on-one tussle with Sebastian Haller on the halfway line in the moments before the opener and Mourinho’s reaction the Belgian’s strength was telling, as he swung towards his backroom staff and applauded the defender relentlessly.</p>
      <p>The Hammers haven’t won a league game since beating Manchester United in September and they needed to score first if they were to get a result against their London rivals. Heads dropped after Son’s opener and with that came more space.</p>

      <p>Spurs doubled their advantage shortly before half-time when Son turned provider for Moura when the Brazilian tapped home the forward’s fizzing cross from the left past a helpless Roberto. But the move was instigated by Alli with a sublime piece of skill on the touchline. The ball looked destined to go out of play before Alli executed a moment of creative brilliance to play Son in. It was emblematic of Alli’s performance and a signal that he’s started a journey of rediscovery.</p>

      <p>Spurs’ half-time advantage would have pleased Mourinho, especially as his side didn’t need to be anywhere approaching their best to earn it. Manuel Pellegrini introduced the fit-again Michail Antonio at half-time but the Hammers found themselves three behind within moments as Harry Kane headed in Serge Aurier’s cross.</p>
      <p>The dissent among the home fans started immediately, with some leaving for the exit doors in the 50th minute. There was ironic cheers for goalkeeper Roberto when he managed to collect the ball, who is clinging onto his place even in the absence of first choice Lukasz Fabiański.</p>
      <p>Kane’s third gave Spurs an invitiation to sit-in and if there was a criticism of Mourinho on his first game in charge it’s that he allowed his side to slip into a passive state. West Ham rarely threatened but they found a goal through Antonio’s endeavours as the forward powered a fine effort past Paulo Gazzaniga 17 minutes from time.</p>

      <p>The Hammers thought they’d reduced the deficit to a single goal in the 89th minute but Declan Rice’s close-range finish would correctly ruled out by VAR as replays showed he was offside. Pellegrini’s side eventually found a second when Angelo Ogbonna tapped in in the 96th minute but there was barely enough time left on the clock for the restart.</p>
      <p>It meant Spurs held on to the win, which is their first league victory on the road since they beat Fulham in January. As important was Mourinho tasting victory on his first game in charge as Spurs boss as the Portuguese bids to win heart and minds in north London. Despite rumblings of dissent, Pochettino never lost the dressing room and he retains huge swathes of support from fans.</p>
      <p>But nothing mattered more today to Spurs than the result. Their appointment of Mourinho was based on their desperation to climb the table. The three points mean they’ve climbed from 14th to 6th, above rivals Manchester United and Arsenal, albeit having played a game more.</p>
      <p>At full-time the 3,000-strong away support sung Alli’s name with extra zest and there were huge cheers as Mourinho made his way over to applaud. It’s been a difficult week for supporters who have found themselves so indebted to Pochettino but in that moment the Argentine’s era was over and Mourinho’s had begun.</p>
