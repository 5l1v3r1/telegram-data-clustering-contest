      <p>Well-maintained and modern, this four-bed semi at 9 Meadowlands Broomfield in Midleton is getting viewings not just from trading-up buyers but also from young couples who want to skip the smaller first-house stage.</p>
      <p>Clare O’Sullivan of Sherry FitzGerald O’Donovan says the €285,000 asking price is making it attractive to both types of buyers and that the first-time buyers who are looking at it like the idea of getting the space they need now rather than having to move again later.</p>
      <p>Noting that there aren’t huge numbers of four bed semis available in Midleton she says that this one offers close to 1,300sq ft of accommodation and is both well finished and tastefully decorated.</p>
      <p>“It’s in the Meadowlands development which was built in the early 2000s and has matured beautifully,” she says adding that it’s within a five-minute drive from the town centre and the train station and also offers easy access to the N25.</p>
