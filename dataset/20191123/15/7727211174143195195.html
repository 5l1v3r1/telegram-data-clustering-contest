      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:05:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/chris-wright/" target="_blank">Chris Wright</a></address>
      <p>Stoney Mountain (16-1) stormed home late to grab the Grade Three Betfair Best Odds On ITV Races Stayers' Handicap Hurdle at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/haydock-racecourse">Haydock Park</a> .</p>
      <p>Trained Henry Daly and owned by triple Grand National winner Trevor Hemmings, the six-year-old came from the back as long-time leader Acey Milan (7-1) and Tedham (5-1 favourite) battled on the run to the line.</p>
      <p>Under Tom O'Brien, Stoney Mountain, loomed up alongside the duo and eventually went on to beat Acey Milan by two-and-a-half lengths, with Tedham a further half length back in third. Ask Ben (10-1) was a neck back in fourth.</p>
      <p>Stoney Mountain - a winner at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree">Aintree</a> last month - relished the better ground at Haydock and looks to have a big future either over hurdles or fences.</p>
      <p>The last two winners of this race - Sam Spinner and Paisley Park - have gone on to Grade One glory over hurdles with last year's hero landing the Stayers' Hurdle at the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheltenham-festival">Cheltenham Festival</a> in March. And while it is early to think that Stoney Mountain can follow in their hoofprints, he is certainly a horse who can get better.</p>
      <p>Whether that is over the smaller obstacles or fences will be left to connections.</p>
      <p>Winning trainer Daly said: "I did think he would go well on the ground when after the first race I saw Sam Twiston-Davies and he said it was good, good to soft. That really helped and didn't do us any harm.</p>
      <p>"He loved the trip. He ran here over three miles last year and got a bit stuck in the ground. But he is a very straightforward horse, owned and bred by Trevor (Hemmings).</p>
      <p>"Knowing Mr Hemmnigs he will (now) be saying fences, fences, fences and we will have to discuss it. BUt he is obviously a really tough little horse and he loves racing and how good he is will be as much in his head as well as anything else."</p>

      <p>An <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton FC</a> fan teamed up with a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool FC</a> supporter as the well-backed Bold Plan (11-4 favourite) came with a late charge to grab a cosy success n the Betfair Exchange Handicap Hurdle.</p>
      <p>Welsh trainer Evan Williams - who has been a blue since childhood - and Reds fan, Irish jockey Robbie Power, combined to score on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>It was also a first winner at Haydock for Power - who famously won the Grand National aboard Gordon Elliott's Silver Birch in 2007.</p>
      <p>The five-year-old, who had only won one of his previous five starts over hurdles, was always travelling well at the rear of the field.</p>
      <p>But he moved through on the turn for home, and despite being well off the leading pack initially, he came through to score by two and a half-lengths from Whoshotthesheriff (5-1). The Donald McCain-trained Fin And Game (14-1) stayed on to be third a further four-and-a-half lengths adrift.</p>
      <p>Power said: "I had a lovely position coming round the back but I was hampered by a horse coming back to me. I had to switch around and they got away from me a little bit. But fair play to Evan (Williams), he gave me a lot of confidence and said ride him whatever way you feel is best - not to be in any rush.</p>
      <p>"He stays well but over that 2m3f he has a turn of foot and plenty of gears. He would jump a fence in time but we will see what the handicapper does and he could win another one."</p>

      <p>Keeper Hill landed a 18-1 shock success in the the Racing Only Bettor Betfair Podcast Graduation Chase.</p>
      <p>Warren Greatrex's talented eight-year-old has had his fair share of issues over recent seasons, hence he went off the rank outsider of the five runners in the extended 2m5f handicap chase.</p>
      <p>But he showed he still has ability and promise over fences when landing a battling half-length success, under Adiran Heskin, over Midnight Shadow (15-8) to leave his trainer shocked but delighted.</p>
      <p>A Grade Two Novices' Chase winner at Doncaster almost two years ago, Keeper Hill has had injury problems and issues with his jumping since.</p>
      <p>He went back over hurdles last season, winning at Warwick and finishing third in the Gaskells Handicap Hurdle at the Randox Health <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/grand-national">Grand National</a> meeting at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/aintree-racecourse">Aintree Racecourse</a> in April.</p>
      <p>Following wind surgery, Greatrex has now sent him back chasing and on his first start of the season he was rewarded with a fine victory at Haydock.</p>
      <p>Greatrex is delighted to have the eight-year-old back and firing and will look at all options for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>He said: "He won a Grade Two, then ran at Musselburgh and had a bad fall, he fell again and then he pulled up in Scotland at the Ayr meeting so we had his back operated on that summer. Last year we went back over hurdles and he did well, But he is a chaser.</p>
      <p>"He has been in really good form at home. We did his wind in the summer and we came here basically in a small field to give him some confidence. But he is seriously talented horse. Adrian (Heskin) said he was cruising all the way. He said at the moment he still hasn't got a lot of confidence in his jumping but that was perfect. He has won off 146, probably wrong at the weights, so he is out of handicaps now. Over three miles he will be even better.</p>
      <p>"I am chuffed to bits. When he came over the alst he pricked his ears. He is a very talented horse. It is great for the whole team and they have worked tirelessly to get this horse back, He is still fairly young, still unexposed so the sky's the limit I would say,</p>
      <p>"I am in shock to be honest. I was perfectly happy if he had a safe trip round and came back and we were good to go to war. But I knew from three out he would win, as he stays very well. But we will go back and speak and make a plan. The way I was thinking is probably out know, which is good."</p>

      <p>Thebannerkingrebel bounced back from his fall at Wetherby last time out to run out an impressive winner of the Listed Read Paul Nicholls Exclusively At Betfair Newton Novices' Hurdle.</p>
      <p>Sent off the 5-4 favourite, the Jamie Snowden-trained six-year-old made it three wins from four starts over obstacles and connections are already eyeing a return to Haydock in the new year en route to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/cheltenham-festival">Cheltenham Festival</a> .</p>
      <p>Under Jamie Snowden, Thebannerkingrebel wasn't always foot perfect again and got away with a mistake at the last to run out a comfortable five-length winner over the Paul Nicholls-trained Calva d'Auge (6-1).</p>
      <p>He looks a promising novice hurdler and trainer Snowden is eyeing the Grade Two Rossington Main Novices' Hurdle - run as the Supremie Novices' Hurdle Trial - back at the Merseyside track in January before a possible crack at the Grade One real thing at Cheltenham in March.</p>
      <p>Snowden said: "It was real shame (at Wetherby) but in fairness it has probably done him no harm as he was a bit careful over a couple of hurdles. He was taking a few liberties over a few at Wetherby and I think he has learned from that and has jumped cleanly - apart from kicking the last out of the ground. But on the whole he has made a better shape over his hurdles and he has quickened away in the manner of a good horse. He has a serious engine. He is a bit of freak really. He has got gears, can go a good gallop and can quicken off it and he is very good.</p>
      <p>"He ended up being in the vets for six months and I said to Chips we have to got to forget about this horse. But finally he came right. He missed a whole year off the track and we then ran him in the Aintree Bumper - the Grade Two - and he just got beaten there. He was mad keen and pulled Gavin's arms out from the word go and he just got beaten by Mcfabulous.</p>
      <p>"Then we gave him a couple of easy runs over hurdles at Warwick and Newton Abbot and at Wetherby he looked the winner jumping the last and then he came here today.</p>
      <p>"He is a very good horse. There is the Rossington Main back here, I know that is a fair way away but that it where my eyes are on. How we get there remains to be seen. And that is a nice springboard into Cheltenham. You have got to think about the Supreme. I haven't seen a horse who has done that over hurdles this season. Obviously we have Pacify and him and hopefully both of them will follow the same path."</p>
