          <p>During the 13th match of the ongoing second season of Mzansi Super League between Paarl Rocks and Jozi Stars in Paarl, Jozi Stars all-rounder Chris Gayle was seen pleading to the umpire after beating Paarl Rocks opening batsman Henry David.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the sixth delivery of the first over when Gayle found David wanting in front of the stumps after he missed a flick. Opening the bowling for his team, Gayle had nearly tasted success in the first over but it wasn’t to be as the umpire ruled the decision in the batsman’s favour.</p>

                <p>Gayle appealed in such a manner that even the umpire was seen laughing at the Universe Boss. The 40-year old cricketer made a baby-like face but even that didn’t work for him.</p>
                <p>Chasing a 130-run target, Rocks sealed the chase in the 17th over. Batsman James Vince, who came in to bat at No. 5 in the sixth over, top-scored for the hosts with 43 (28) with the help of four fours and a six. In the only over that Gayle bowled, he gave away only five runs.</p>

                      <p>It was Stars captain Temba Bavuma who won the toss and chose to bat. A below par batting performance saw the visitors scoring 129/3 in 20 overs. Having opened the batting with Ryan Rickelton (30), Reeza Hendricks top-scored for his team with 40 (34) with the help of three fours.</p>
                      <p>Having won two out of the four matches that they’ve played so far, Paarl are currently at No. 3 at the points table. On the other hand, Jozi Stars are reeling at the bottom on the back of losing five matches on the trot.</p>
