      <p>Jose Mourinho revelled in returning to his "natural habitat" of a Premier League dugout after his Tottenham side earned a 3-2 derby victory at West Ham to give him a winning start.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed as Mauricio Pochettino's successor this week and oversaw Spurs' first away Premier League win since January.</p>
      <p>Goals from Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane set up a triumph more comfortable than a scoreline affected by late consolations from Michail Antonio and Angelo Ogbonna suggested, though Declan Rice also had a goal ruled out by VAR.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United almost a year ago, while he was seemingly overlooked by big clubs including Juventus.</p>
      <p>"The most difficult moments in the 11 months were when I didn't have a pre-season and was looking at other clubs and managers doing it," Mourinho told reporters.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes I was at football games and I was thinking 'what am I doing here', in the [directors'] box or the [television] studio. Today I was where I belong, my natural habitat."</p>

      <p>Mourinho explained the approach he has taken at Tottenham since taking over from Pochettino, who led the team to last season's Champions League final.</p>
      <p>"I tried to give the players comfort, especially in this moment where [there was] a little bit of emotion around it and tried to give them comfort by asking of them things that they can give," the former Chelsea and Manchester United manager added.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes we complicate things and ask things of the players that they're not ready to give. I try to ask the boys, Dele [Alli], of course Harry, Son, Lucas, Harry Winks, Eric [Dier], I tried to give them exactly what the easiest job is for them, adapted to their qualities and I think Dele feels very comfortable in this role, with freedom but following principles and things that we do in training.</p>
      <p>"So I think they're fine. We have a game in two days [against Olympiacos on Tuesday]. I think we can go and win that match at home and qualify in the Champions League and I think the mood becomes high for the boys."</p>

      <p>Pressure is growing on West Ham boss Manuel Pellegrini after a sixth loss in seven Premier League games, with backup goalkeeper Roberto Jimenez continuing to struggle deputising for Lukasz Fabianski.</p>
      <p>"We need to win the next games, the media asks the same question," said Pellegrini, whose side are away to in-form Chelsea next weekend.</p>
      <p>"We must win the next game and then we will see what happens. These are not the results we expected, especially at home. It is a tight Premier League this season but we need to improve in all of our play."</p>
      <p>Asked about Roberto's poor form, the goalkeeper conceding three times for the third league game in a row, Pellegrini added: "I do not want to talk about the goalkeeper."</p>
