      <h1>Residents have their say on plans for huge development where 805 homes and a new school could be built</h1>
      <h2>Work is needed to due to the 'high demand' for housing in Nottinghamshire</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:55:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Pridmore, Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>Plans to build more than 800 homes on a large area of rural land near Hucknall have received a mixed response from residents.</p>
      <p>Planning consultant Pegasus Group is currently preparing a planning application on behalf of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-county-council">Nottinghamshire County Council</a> for the the Top Wighay Farm site in Linby near <a href="http://www.nottighampost.com/all-about/hucknall">Hucknall</a>.</p>
      <p>Proposals include creating 805 homes, land for employment purposes, a local centre, a new primary school and associated infrastructure, as well as new areas of 'multi-purpose green space'.</p>
      <p>The county council, which owns the site, said there is a 'high demand' for housing in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> and building new homes there would meet the needs of 'existing and future residents.</p>
      <p>The site has been formally allocated for residential and employment development by <a href="http://www.nottinghampos.com/all-about/gedling-borough-council">Gedling Borough Council</a>, the planning authority for that area.</p>

      <p>A public exhibition was held on Tuesday, November 19 for people living nearby to find out more and give their feedback.</p>
      <p>The scheme has received some backlash, with concerns around traffic congestion, flooding, pressure on services and one resident described the site as "a quality of life issue".</p>
      <p>For others, the positive impact on local businesses is welcomed as well as addressing the housing need.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Live visited Wighay Road opposite the land, to ask what some residents thought in wake of the public exhibition.</p>
      <p>Robert Cooper, 64, said: "I'm really worried about the traffic congestion.</p>
      <p>"Even when I'm setting off for work in the middle of the night I can be waiting five minutes to get out of our drive.</p>
      <p>"Another major concern is flooding. Cars don't slow down so throughout the day the water moves towards the houses.</p>
      <p>"I've lived here for about 23 years and there was never any flooding, but as soon as the last development was built along this road it became an issue - and now this new development is just going to make that worse."</p>

      <p>Alison Madge, 57, who owns a beauty salon on Wighay Road, said: "Obviously from a business perspective I say bring it on - because business did improve when the last development was built.</p>
      <p>"But do I completely understand why [residents] worried about this.</p>
      <p>"This road is shocking for congestion and I can't see that this development is going to help that situation - especially when the building work is going on.</p>
      <p>"I haven't had much information from the council about this either. It's been mostly through word of mouth from my customers."</p>
      <p>Caroline Tutin, 37, who lives on the last development that was built, said: "To be honest, we are very much pro-housing in this house.</p>
      <p>"I understand some residents are worried because the view from their houses would just have been fields before our development was put up - and this new one is going to restrict that even further.</p>
      <p>"But it's a fact that we do need housing in this country and we were told about the possibility of this development when we moved in to our house around three years ago, and it definitely didn't put us off."</p>

      <p>Paul Smith, 67, a resident of more than 40 years said: "For me this is a quality of life issue.</p>
      <p>"The view from my house was lovely, but now I've got this total eyesore of the recent development and now they want to make it even worse.</p>
      <p>"I have to keep my blinds shut because otherwise I've got bright headlights shining through my window.</p>
      <p>"What annoys me is that there are old pits in Gedling that they could be building on but instead, Gedling gifted itself a country park on one of those sites and so instead they're trying to build as far away from Gedling as they can.</p>
      <p>"It's a lousy proposal and it's also going to put huge pressure on local health services round here - it's just terrible and I couldn't be more against it."</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire County Council’s corporate director for place, Adrian Smith said: “We were delighted that so many local people attended the event which provided us with the opportunity to share the proposed plans.</p>
      <p>"The development will be a new village with green spaces, cycleways, and walkways built in from the beginning together with a primary school, local playing field, and provision for changing rooms and a village hall.</p>
      <p>"There are also plans for shops, medical facilities, and more to make this a real community.</p>
      <p>"The plans also allocate space for prestige office buildings, including a new building for the county council, which will support employment in the area.</p>
      <p>"We appreciate and welcome the views of residents to help us ensure the development would meet the needs of local people.</p>
      <p>"For anyone who was unable to attend the event they can view the plans and make their comments online before the deadline of December, 6.</p>
      <p>"Once all comments have been reviewed a planning application will be submitted to Gedling Borough Council in early 2020 who will then undertake their own consultation.”</p>
