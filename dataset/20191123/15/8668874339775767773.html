      <h1>Saracens cruise to comfortable Champions Cup win at subdued Allianz Park</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/saracens-vs-ospreys-live-heineken-champions-cup">Saracens overwhelmed the </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> 44-3 but their first home match since the salary cap scandal broke was played amid a subdued atmosphere at Allianz Park.</p>
      <p>It was a return to winning ways for the Champions Cup holders after they launched their defence with a frustrating defeat at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> and their performance was a vast improvement on the opener six days earlier.</p>
      <p>Elliot Daly’ Saracens debut was full of creative devilry and the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/england">England</a> full-back, playing his first match since the World Cup final on November 2, set-up two tries for lightning-fast wing Rotimi Segun.</p>
      <p>Mako Vunipola and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/george-kruis/">George Kruis</a> also returned to action after helping Eddie Jones’ squad reach the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> showpiece and the tight five trio made substantial contributions to a superb bonus-point victory.</p>
      <p>Singleton went over for Saracens’ first try and was eventually replaced by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/jamie-george/">Jamie George</a>, while captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/brad-barritt/">Brad Barritt</a> made a successful comeback after six weeks out because of concussion.</p>

      <p>The Ospreys were missing their <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> stars and Mark McCall’s men ruthlessly dismantled weakened opposition who fought manfully but lacked the firepower to cause any real damage.</p>
      <p>Saracens have now won two of their three matches since being docked 35 points in the Gallager Premiership and fined £5.36million for breaching salary cap regulations and this victory keeps them in the hunt for a European quarter-final.</p>
      <p>Daly’s first meaningful act in a <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> jersey was to land a long-range penalty that sailed well beyond the target and although Ospreys had made a solid start, they fell further behind when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/manu-vunipola/">Manu Vunipola</a> was also successful from the kicking tee. And another of Jones’ World Cup squad was among the points when Singleton was driven over from an attacking line-out.</p>

      <p>James Hook landed a penalty for Ospreys to eat into the deficit but their response was short-lived as a scrum move continued by an instinctive volley from half-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/tom-whiteley/">Tom Whiteley</a> found Daly who drew the last defender to send Segun screaming over.</p>
      <p>A dummy and charge from <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/mako-vunipola/">Mako Vunipola</a> sent the Ospreys backwards and when play swept to the opposite wing Segun was present to supply <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/alex-lewington/">Alex Lewington</a> with the scoring pass.</p>

      <p>The outstanding Daly combined with Segun once against for the try that secured the bonus point as he slipped the ball out of the tackle for the jet-heeled wing to score in the right corner.</p>
      <p>The Ospreys continued to wilt before Saracens’ power and when they were shoved backwards at a five-metre scrum they were breached for a fifth time with referee Mathieu Raynal awarding a penalty try.</p>
      <p>And when waves of black shirts renewed the attack, it was replacement prop <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/richard-barrington/">Richard Barrington</a> who barrelled over to complete the rout.</p>
