      <h1>Hot chocolate as thieves brazenly steal truck-load of the sweet stuff</h1>

      <p>Thieves brazenly stole a truck-load of chocolate from a factory in Austria.</p>
      <p>They made off with a 20,000-tonne consignment after posing as the delivery firm chosen to transport it to Belgium.</p>
      <p>The chocolate came from the Milka factory in Bludenz, western Austria, and was worth around €50,000, reported AFP.</p>
      <p>The delivery of the chocolate was outsourced multiple times. One transport company hired a fake transportation company over the internet from the Czech Republic to complete the delivery, Austrian police inspector Stefan Eder told Euronews.</p>
      <p>Eder said the truck had stolen number plates on it. He added that this was a difficult case since it was not limited to just Austria.</p>
      <p>Milka was founded in Germany and 1901 and its biggest markets are in Europe. It belongs to the American company Mondelez International.</p>
      <p>Euronews has reached out to the company for comment but they had not responded at the time of publication.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the company generated more than $1.5 billion [roughly €1.3 billion] of revenues, according to its parent company.</p>
