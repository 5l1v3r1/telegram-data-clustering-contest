      <h1>Neil Harris tips Cardiff City 'maverick' to shine under him but questions team mindset after sloppy defending at Charlton</h1>
      <h2>The Bluebirds came back from 2-0 down to earn a draw against Charlton at The Valley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:29:26+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Glen Williams</a></address>
      <p>Neil Harris believes he can coax the very best out of Lee Tomlin after the playmaker produced another touch of magic to snatch a draw for Cardiff City away at Charlton Athletic.</p>
      <p>The Bluebirds showed great character to come back from two goals down to earn a point at The Valley and it was Tomlin's introduction from the bench which proved a masterstroke.</p>
      <p>Fans have been calling for Tomlin to have greater and more consistent opportunities this season and once again he put his hand up for selection against Stoke City on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Harris said that Tomlin 'showed his class' when he rifled home City's second of the afternoon and when asked if he is the type of player who could really shine under his tutelage, he replied: "Without a shadow of a doubt.</p>
      <p>"I like goalscorers and players who have got some ability.</p>
      <p>"Every player has to work hard in my changing room and have to have discipline, but you have to have some mavericks and match-winners.</p>
      <p>"That's Tomlin and the wide players, like Josh Murphy, who will have his chances, too.</p>
      <p>"Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, Junior Hoilett, they are your mavericks, you need goals from them."</p>
      <p>Harris, in his first game since taking charge of the Bluebirds, was, however, disappointed with his team at the other end.</p>
      <p>City were carved open by two counter attacks in the first half with ease, much to the displeasure of the travelling Cardiff City supporters.</p>
      <p>The manager shared their disappointment after the match, questioning whether his side's mindset needs to change in order to stop leaking goals on the road.</p>

      <p>"I wouldn't say concerned," he said, "I would say I was disappointed with the goals today.</p>
      <p>"We defend as a team and attack as a team. So we'll have to look at the mindset of the group, why haven't we been keeping clean sheets over the course of the season?</p>
      <p>"Is it an individual mindset or a group mindset?</p>
      <p>"We gave the ball away and have been countered on and not defended properly, that's the mindset that has got to change straight away."</p>
      <p>It is certainly something that needs to be put right quickly if the Bluebirds are to begin a charge up the table anytime soon.</p>
