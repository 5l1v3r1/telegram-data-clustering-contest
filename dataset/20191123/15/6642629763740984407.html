      <p>At least 36 people, including seven children, have been killed by landslides triggered by unusually heavy rains in northwestern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/kenya.html">Kenya</a>, a local official said.</p>
      <p>The downpour began on Friday in West Pokot County, which borders <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/uganda.html">Uganda</a>, and worsened overnight, causing flooding and mudslides that swept away four bridges and left the worst-affected village, Muino, unaccessible by road.</p>

      <p>"We can confirm that the number of those dead has sadly reached 36. Some people who we thought were lost have been found dead," Samuel Poghisio, a senator from the county, told Reuters news agency by phone.</p>
      <p>"More people are marooned and the entire village is at risk of being wiped out by the floods," the county's governor, John Lonyangapuo, told Reuters as he waited for a helicopter to transport him to survey the damage.</p>
      <p>He added that rescue efforts were under way in the area, where more than 500 vehicles were stuck on roads damaged by the landslides.</p>
      <p>Rescue efforts have been delayed because roads have been cut and bridges closed after streams turned into raging torrents.</p>
      <p>"Massive landslides reported in various areas of West Pokot County following heavy downpour," Kenya Red Cross said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/KenyaRedCross/status/1198116686458740736">message</a>, adding that its emergency response teams had been deployed to help.</p>
      <p>Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said in a statement that he had deployed rescue personnel from various agencies including the army and the police to try to stop the "further loss of lives".</p>
      <h3>Regional effect</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/landslide.html">landslide</a> came amid weeks of destructive rains and flooding across East <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/africa.html">Africa</a>.</p>
      <p>Downpours have displaced tens of thousands in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Somalia.html">Somalia</a> and submerged whole towns in <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-sudan.html">South Sudan</a>, while dozens of people have been killed in flash floods and landslides in parts of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Ethiopia.html">Ethiopia</a> and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/Tanzania.html">Tanzania</a>.</p>
      <p>In South Sudan alone, close to a million people have been affected amid growing fears of disease and starvation.</p>
      <p>Floods hit East Africa regularly, but scientists say they have recently been exacerbated by a powerful climate phenomenon in the Indian Ocean stronger than any seen in years.</p>
      <p>The extreme <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/categories/weather.html">weather</a> is blamed on the Indian Ocean Dipole - a climate system defined by the difference in sea surface temperature between western and eastern areas of the ocean.</p>
      <p>The ocean off East Africa is currently far warmer than usual, resulting in higher evaporation causing rain over the continent.</p>
      <p>In April 2018, landslides in Kenya killed 100 people and displaced thousands.</p>
