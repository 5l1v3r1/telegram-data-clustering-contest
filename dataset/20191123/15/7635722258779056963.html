        <b>Lostintranslation is the new favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup after winning the Betfair Chase at Haydock under the ride of Robbie Power.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Colin Tizzard's charge pulled clear in a battle to overcome defending champion Bristol De Mai by one-and-a-half lengths at the finish line.</p>
      <p>Nigel Twiston Davies' grey had been bidding to win the Grade One for the third successive year.</p>
      <p>Frodon was a further 24 lengths behind Bristol De Mai with Ballyoptic in fourth.</p>

      <p>It's a fourth win for Tizzard in the opening Grade One of the British National Hunt season and first since Cue Card's success in 2016.</p>

      <p>"I got there way too soon after he travelled so well into the race. Bristol De Mai is a very good horse round here so that was a brilliant performance to beat him," Power told Racing TV.</p>
      <p>"We're dreaming of the Gold Cup now. He was a very good novice last season but didn't know how he'd fare in the big boys' league. He's proven how good he is, roll on the King George!"</p>
