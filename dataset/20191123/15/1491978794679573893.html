      <p>Figures for BBC special far lower than for Johnson-Corbyn single combat format on ITV</p>

      <p>More than 4 million people watched a BBC Question Time audience grill political leaders on their general election policies, a slump in the number of viewers who saw Boris Johnson’s head-to-head debate with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> earlier this week.</p>
      <p>A peak audience of 4.6 million watched Johnson, Corbyn, Jo Swinson and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> battle a barrage of hostile questioning from an audience in Sheffield during the two-hour programme on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The average number of viewers throughout the show was 4.23 million, representing a significant drop from the 6.7 million who switched on for ITV’s leaders’ debate on Tuesday, in which Johnson and Corbyn faced each other. However, the figures are higher than Question Time’s normal audience of about 2-2.5 million.</p>
      <p>The special <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/question-time">Question Time</a> episode also drew nearly double that figure, and significantly more than the 2.4 million average audience of the popular Graham Norton chat show that was aired later in the evening.</p>
      <p>Fiona Bruce chaired a bruising night of live questioning from audience members on Friday, during which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/22/jeremy-corbyn-labour-neutral-second-brexit-vote">Corbyn revealed he would take a “neutral stance”</a> should there be a future Brexit referendum if Labour wins the election. The Labour leader was also confronted with questions about his party’s record on antisemitism and nationalisation plans.</p>
      <p>Johnson was wounded after questioning on his trustworthiness, and was also accused of fomenting racism with the inflammatory language he used in his newspaper columns, including one in which he described Muslim women wearing burqas as looking like “letter boxes”.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrat leader Swinson faced a torrid time as she was questioned about her voting record in the coalition government, as well as her party’s pledge to revoke Brexit.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Scottish National party leader and Scottish first minister Sturgeon confirmed she could support a Corbyn government in exchange for an independence referendum.</p>
      <p>A BBC spokeswoman said: “We’re delighted 4.2 million (with a peak of 4.6 million) people tuned into the Question Time Leaders’ Debate Special on Friday night. It is the first in a series of programmes which will culminate in a head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> in December.</p>
      <p>“We think it was a quality programme which put the audience in charge and will have proved genuinely informative for our viewers.”</p>
