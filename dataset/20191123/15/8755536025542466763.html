      <p>The SOSU by SJ founder was flooded with supportive messages after sharing the troll’s nasty DM.</p>
      <p>Taking to her Instagram Story today, Sue told her 276k followers: “Lots of people are messaging me about that message last night, but it really doesn’t bother me.”</p>
      <p>“That’s just light compared to what you would receive some days.”</p>
