      <p>The footage shows one police car at the scene. As the vehicle passes by a black car is clearly visible having collided with a stone wall at the front of a house.</p>
      <p>The damaged car has come to rest at the entrance to the driveway, with large garden stones scattered underneath. It has clearly mounted the pavement before impact.</p>
      <p>Police say they are unable to give any details of what happened or whether anyone was injured.</p>
      <p>The weekend has seen a number of police call-outs for police, many caused by the heavy rain.</p>
      <p>Weather warnings are in place for the next five days and there have been several crashes on the major roads of Devon and Cornwall.</p>
