      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:47:50+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho guided Tottenham to victory over West Ham in his first match in charge of the north London club, following Mauricio Pochettino's sacking on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese shuffled the pack, bringing in English duo Eric Dier and Dele Alli, and watched on as his side stormed into a three-goal lead, with Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Harry Kane all getting on the scoresheet.</p>
      <p>The Hammers battled back in the final fifteen minutes in east London, with Michail Antonio reducing the deficit before Angelo Ogbonna made it 3-2 with the final kick of the game.</p>
      <p>The win sees <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> move up to eighth, eight points behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in fourth.</p>
      <p>Mourinho spoke to the press following the match at London Stadium; here is everything the Portuguese had to say about his new team and their performance.</p>

      <h3>On the importance of winning</h3>
      <p>It was very very important. 11 months without music in the away dressing room, without a smile or happiness. They did it. I am very happy for them and with them. If someone only saw the result they'd have thought it was very difficult for us.</p>
      <p>But it was probably closer to a 4-0 than 3-1. I think my players paid the price of a very difficult week. International break, change of manager, new guy, different training sessions.</p>
      <h3>On Dele Alli</h3>
      <p>I think Dele was like the team, brilliant for 60-65 minutes and then he paid also the price of the tiredness so he went a little bit down.</p>
      <p>I think it was the old Dele Alli, the Dele Alli of a couple of years ago who impressed not just for England but all. He did everything I asked him to do.</p>
      <h3>On Dele Alli's skill for goal</h3>
      <p>It was just in front of me. The piece of skill was amazing, but what for me is more amazing is the mental thing in relation that.</p>
      <p>You only do that if you are focused, committed, ultra confident, if not you give up when you have bad feeling, sadness, you don't do that piece of skill.</p>
      <p>It is amazing, but it only comes when from an emotional point of view everything is positive. Fantastic, I am really happy.</p>
      <h3>On missing football management</h3>
      <p>The most difficult moments in the 11 months were when I didn't have a pre-season and was looking at other clubs and managers doing it.</p>
      <p>Sometimes I was at football games and I was thinking what am I doing here, in the box or the studio. Today I was were I belong, my natural habitat.</p>
      <h3>On the dressing room</h3>
      <p>Yesterday I felt they weren't sure if I didn't like the music in the dressing room and it was very low.</p>
      <p>But the dressing room is their home during the week. The music after a game is something you have to value. To win is hard. You have to value it.</p>
      <h3>On simplifying things at Spurs</h3>
      <p>I tried to give the players comfort and especially in this moment where a little bit of emotion around it and trying to give them comfort by asking of them things that they can give.</p>

      <p>Sometimes we complicate things and ask things of the players that they're not ready to give. I try to ask the boys, Dele, of course Harry, Son, Lucas, Harry Winks, Eric, I tried to give them exactly what the easiest job is for them, adapted to their qualities and I think Dele feels very comfortable in this role, with freedom but following principles and things that we do in training.</p>
      <p>So I think they're fine. We have a game in two days. I think we can go and win that match at home and qualify in the Champions League and I think the mood becomes high for the boys.</p>
