      <h1>Zimbabwean president to rename 10 streets after himself</h1>

      <p>Zimbabwean president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has made known his decision to rename 10 roads in eight urban centres after himself.</p>
      <p>According to South African newspaper, <i><a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/africa/2019-11-22-me-me-me-me-me-me-me-and-me-mnangagwa-names-eight-streets-after-himself/">TimesLIVE</a></i>, the decision was the fallout of a cabinet meeting on Thursday, which announced several roads in the country would be named after the nation’s heroes.</p>
      <p>However, the number of streets that would be named after the sitting president has been causing raised eyebrows.</p>
      <p>Former deputy prime minister in the inclusive government of 2009 to 2013, Prof. Arthur Mutambara, told <i>TimesLIVE</i> that the renaming of the roads after Mnangagwa was meant to cover up his shortcomings.</p>
      <p>“An incompetent Mnangagwa wants to immortalise himself. All the other name changes are to cover up this wicked ambition. Whether he fails or prevails, he wants immortality.</p>
      <p>“Zimbabweans will be calling his name in eight cities every day, forever. That is the ‘big idea’ while the country degenerates into unprecedented political and economic mayhem,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet Committee on Place Names said the renaming of more than 89 streets countrywide was both a reflection of the country’s values and “a social engagement tool that fosters understanding, peace and unity in diversity,” reports UK’s <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/22/mnangagwa-street-fidel-castro-road-zimbabwes-president-ditches/"><i>Telegraph</i></a>.</p>
