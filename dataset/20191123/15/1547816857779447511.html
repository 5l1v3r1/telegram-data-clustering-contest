      <p>Kim Kardashian, of course, gets the best, her engagement ring too was quite unique. However, her massive rock was stolen when robbers barged into her room in Paris in 2016. She had informed the media that the ring which was given by Kanye West has been stolen. But! The ring made a comeback in her recent photoshoot promoting her new fragrance line. How, we wonder! But the mystery has been solved as Kim has herself given an explanation.</p>
      <p>To ET! Online, Kim was quoted saying, "I borrowed all jewelry from Lorraine Schwartz. It was nice to borrow it all and nice to give it back to her. That was a really fun shoot and because it was diamonds, I thought this was the perfect way to bring it back and wear them again." A 20-carat emerald cut diamond ring given by Kanye West was taken away by the thieves and in the photoshoot of KKW fragrance Diamonds Collection, fans spotted the same ring on her finger.

      <p>Kim further went on to say, "She always knows the cut and everything that I really wanted. So when I want to wear something, I'll borrow it from her for the day. There is a replica around. A little fake that I'll borrow from her sometimes that she made. A really nice one. It looks really nice." Okay then!</p>
