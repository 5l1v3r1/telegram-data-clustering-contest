      <p>The Ipro Amber 5S (3G) and Ipro Amber 5S pro (4G) smart phones are to provide customers the opportunity to enjoy faster internet coverage.</p>

      <p>As leaders within the industry, he said, MTN understands the importance of providing affordable smartphones to its customers, adding “we have been doing our best to partner Original Equipment Manufacturing companies who buy into our vision.</p>
      <p>He said that in spite of the progress made at improving smartphone penetration, there is still room for improvement and that is why, MTN continue to invest in partnerships aimed at giving desired result of having close to 100 per cent penetration in the near future.</p>
      <p>The two phones are 4G and 3G entry level smartphones that run on the Android Go Operating System.</p>
      <p>With a 5inch screen, the MTN IPro Amber 5s/ ipro Amber 5s Pro phones come well equipped with pre-installed apps such as WhatsApp, Google Maps, Facebook, YouTube, and many more.</p>
      <p>The adaptability of the device makes it easier than ever to connect with others wherever you go.</p>
      <p>The phones come at a retail price of GH¢275.00 and GH¢255.00 for the 4G and 3G respectively.</p>
