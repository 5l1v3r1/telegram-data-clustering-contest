      <p>After last week’s insane elbow knockout (see it <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/16/20967922/highlights-watch-insane-elbow-flying-knee-knockouts-from-lfa-and-one-championship-action-video-mma">HERE</a>) that made its way around the MMA community, Legacy Fighting Alliance (LFA) produced yet another memorable finish during last night’s (Fri., Nov. 22, 2019) LFA 79 event in Broomfield, Colorado.</p>
      <p>As part of the UFC Fight Pass-aired main card, a 140-pound catchweight bout was contested between 23-year-old Colorado native Youssef Zalal and struggling veteran Jaime Hernandez, who was coming off a TKO loss to Hunter Azure back in February.</p>
      <p>After a few minutes of action to start the first round, Halal put space between himself and Hernandez in order to launch a devastating jumping switch knee that connected flush on Hernandez’s chin. The elder fighter immediately fell to the canvas as the referee rushed in for the decisive knockout stoppage.</p>
      <p>Check out the jumping knee finish above courtesy of UFC Fight Pass. The slow-motion version can be seen below:</p>

      <p>With this performance, Halal gets back in the LFA win column after dropping back-to-back decisions to the likes of Matt Jones and Jose Mariscal earlier this year. Halal is usually seen submitting opponents inside of the cage, but this was a nice change on a weekend desperate for memorable MMA action.</p>
      <p>The young “Moroccan Devil” now has an overall record of 4-2 in LFA competition and looks to be one of the promotion’s best prospects heading into 2020.</p>
