        <b>ST Andrews University students have been targeted in a series of “violent attacks” over the past month – with a 14-year-old among five people who have been arrested.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cops have urged vigilance among the town’s student population amid four alleged incidents between October 13 and November 21.</p>

      <p>It comes as officers step up patrols in the area to ensure there is a “visible police presence”.</p>
      <p>Police say the alleged incidents have caused "concern" among students in the town.</p>
      <p>It is believed that all of the “attacks” were linked – and were allegedly carried out by the same group of people.</p>
      <p>Four men and a woman, aged between 14 and 21, have been nicked in connection with three of the alleged incidents.</p>
      <p>And cops are still probing an assault on South Street from October 13.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Matt Spencer, of the Community Policing team in St Andrews, said: "Thankfully nobody has been seriously injured in any of these incidents but understandably they have caused concern among the student population.</p>
      <p>"We want to ensure students in St Andrews continue to feel safe while they live and study in the town.</p>
      <p>“We are liaising with a number of partners, including the university, student association and local elected members.</p>
      <p>"Students should be able to go about their lives without any fear of crime but I would urge people to be vigilant.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who has any concerns can contact police by calling 101 or 999 in an emergency.</p>
      <p>“Students can also seek advice from appropriate services at the university.</p>
      <p>"As a result of these incidents, which will not be tolerated by the police, we have increased patrols in key areas and have drawn on additional resources from outwith the area to ensure a visible police presence.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful for the support of the local community while we carry out this work.”</p>
