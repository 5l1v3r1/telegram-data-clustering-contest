      <p>The way we speak about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> is changing – if you ask your parents if they know what ghosting is they’re likely to refer you to Derek Acorah or Yvette Fielding.</p>
      <p>It might seem like the landscape of love is changing for the worse, but in reality we’re just more inventive at defining the crushing blows that are part and parcel of trying to get someone to fancy you and/or have sex with you.</p>
      <p>There were always dumpings, there were always fights over the bill, and there were always moments where you got too drunk out of nervousness and ended up throwing up on your date (or was that just me?).</p>
      <p>Nowadays, however, we like to give things punchy names to soften the blows. And the people at dating site Plenty of Fish have compiled a handy little list of the ones we’ll need to know in the new year.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Nice to know how we’ll be getting hurt, you know? Forewarning is forearming.</p>
      <h3>Fleabagging</h3>
      <p>A la PWB, this trend relates to consistently dating people that are wrong for you.</p>
      <p>According to Plenty of Fish, it’s more common with women, with 63% admitting to Fleabagging compared to just 38% of men.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there is truth in the old adage that women love bad boys. Or at least just bad for them boys?</p>
      <h3>Dial Toning</h3>
      <p>Different to ghosting, this is when someone gives you their number to text them but when you do, you never hear back.</p>
      <p>Ghosting requires there to have been some sort of textual contact previously, whereas this can be the result of an IRL chance meeting.</p>
      <p>You might have thought you’d be home and dry because they gave you their number, but alas they’ve woken up in the morning and decided they fancied you more under the sodium light of the street outside the chicken shop.</p>

      <h3>Cause-playing</h3>
      <p>47% of singles have experienced this phenomenon, with singles in their early 40s are the most guilty of doing it.</p>
      <p>It refers to getting back in touch with an ex after you’ve broken up to ask for a favour, usually something charity-related like donating to your just giving page.</p>
      <p>If you’ve ever had ‘hey, I’m playing a gig/running a marathon/doing a stand-up show, could you come along/donate?’ then you’ve probably been victim.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <h3>Eclipsing</h3>
      <p>We’ve all seen it; when our friend gets a new partner and suddenly takes up a new-found interest in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu or watching Rick and Morty.</p>
      <p>‘You’ve never been into that before,’ you say, and they shrug and look at their new beau’s Pickle Rick t-shirt with a fondness that makes you uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Eclipsing is when someone starts adopting the same interests and hobbies as the person they are dating. Hopefully it’s something more wholesome, like baking or donating money to their long-suffering pals.</p>
      <h3>Exoskeleton-ing</h3>
      <p>When the ex of your current partner keeps reaching out to you, this is known as exoskeleton-ing.</p>
      <p>Over a fifth of singles (22%) have had their partner’s ex come to haunt them via social media or other means but only 6% of singles admit to having being this ex themselves. Who’s lying?</p>
      <h3>Yellow Carding</h3>
      <p>This one is actually a good thing. It’s when you call someone out for their poor dating etiquette (potentially doing anything else on this list).</p>
      <p>Red carding would mean you dump them altogether, which is potentially a better option, but we’ll stay out of it.</p>
      <h3>Glamboozled</h3>
      <p>Getting fully done up for a date, only to have your plans fall through at the last minute is the worst. You’ve just been glamboozled.</p>
      <p>A troubling 54% of daters have experienced this. Just think of all the wasted foundation and eyeshadow. A sin.</p>
      <p>On the upside, you can always just call your mates and waste your makeup by sweating it off in the club instead.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <h3>Typecasting</h3>
      <p>Exclusively dating people based on Myers-Briggs Type or ‘Love Language’ compatibility is typecasting.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you might also have the phrase ‘no geminis’ on your dating profile, which would make you a typecaster – and correct.</p>
      <p>Doesn’t extend to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/flatshares-tory-voters-need-not-apply/">politely telling potential flatmates that they might not be a great fit as they’re a Tory</a>.</p>
