      <h3>City council begins debating Saskatoon’s first two-year budget on Monday. Here are some of the highlights.</h3>
      <p>
        <b>LOW BLOW</b>
      </p>
      <p>The proposed property tax increases of 3.23 per cent for 2020 and 3.54 per cent in 2021 would be the lowest in a decade. Traditionally, the administration has proposed a budget and tax increase and council has chipped away at it to bring the tax hike down or up, depending on politicians’ priorities.</p>
      <p>City hall has been embracing a more transparent process where the budget is composed and approved throughout the year. In other words, it’s not clear how much room there is for changes. Council may have little appetite to embrace more spending, given the mayor and councillors face an election in less than a year. Last year, council spent 16 hours over two days deliberating on the budget, three hours more than in 2017.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LATE REQUEST</b>
      </p>
      <p>Council’s resolve to keep the property tax increases at their proposed level will be tested early Monday. Saskatoon police Chief Troy Cooper announced this month he intended to seek an additional eight officers to monitor a planned supervised drug consumption site in the Pleasant Hill neighbourhood.</p>
      <p>The extra officers are expected to cost taxpayers $828,800 more in 2020 and $807,600 more in 2021. The extra spending would boost the property tax increase by 0.34 per cent in 2020 and by 0.32 per cent in 2021. Without the extra officers, the budget includes 66.8 new full-time employees in 2020 and 40.5 new full-timers in 2021.</p>
      <p>The city’s budget document points out city hall is trending down in terms of the number of full-time employees per 1,000 residents.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LIBRARY LOAN</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the biggest decisions council faces this year is whether or not to approve borrowing $87.5 million for a new downtown library. The Saskatoon Public Library is run by a board appointed by city council and has its own power to tax properties. The library’s portion amounts to about six per cent of the total property tax bill. But the library’s budget must be approved by council and any debt it accrues is considered part of the city’s overall debt.</p>
      <p>Coun. Troy Davies has said he plans to trigger a vote to convince the library board to come back with a cheaper plan for a smaller building.</p>
      <p>Leadership at TCU Place, a city-owned facility that is run by a board, has asked for “special consideration” at budget talks for a new downtown convention centre to replace the 1968 facility.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CARBON CONUNDRUM</b>
      </p>
      <p>City council’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions will face a big test. How and whether to fund city hall’s controversial low-emissions community plan will be considered at budget talks.</p>
      <p>The plan is estimated to cost $19 billion, but result in total savings of $33.6 billion. The goal is to reduce Saskatoon carbon emissions by 80 per cent from 2014 levels by 2050. The plan includes 40 initiatives like switching to an electric bus fleet and providing incentives for more energy-efficient buildings and renewable energy. City hall’s part of the plan is estimated to cost $6.1 billion.</p>
      <p>Council will decide between seven options on how to fund the plan. They include a dedicated property tax increase, reinvesting savings realized by implementing the plan and using an expected refund of the federal carbon tax. Other options involve using part of a one-time $14.1-million federal gas tax payout, diverting money from a reserve fund and borrowing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WASTING AWAY </b>
      </p>
      <p>Council already appears to have made the decision to move forward with an organic waste curbside collection program for single-family homes by the year 2023. Two components in this year’s budget will help make the program a reality.</p>
      <p>Council approved earlier this year a one per cent property tax increase over the next four years to pay for the program’s operating cost. Council also appears to favour using $10 million of the one-time $14.1-million federal gas tax payment to buy the green carts.</p>
      <p>A final decision on the carts purchase will be made next week. It’s worth noting, though, that the division on council over waste runs deep. A year ago, council approved a switch to a user-fee utility model for trash collection, only to reverse the decision a couple of weeks later when Coun. Darren Hill changed his mind. Coun. Bev Dubois said in August she wanted a vote on lowering the property tax increase for the organics program. She later changed her mind and withdrew the motion.</p>
