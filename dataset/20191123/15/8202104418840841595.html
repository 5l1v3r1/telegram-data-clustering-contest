      <h3>A Saskatchewan First Nation is not backing away from its demand that the provincial government reopen consultations on a proposed diamond mine east of Prince Albert, even as the environment minister signalled that is not going to happen.</h3>
      <p>James Smith Cree Nation has <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/james-smith-cree-nation-considering-options-after-sask-government-greenlights-diamond-mine">long been concerned</a> about the potential effects of building an open-pit mine in the Fort à la Corne forest, fears that did not change when the provincial government <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/government-grants-environmental-approval-for-prince-albert-area-diamond-mine">greenlit the project last October</a>.</p>
      <p>The band has maintained that the “accommodations” included with the environmental approval are insufficient, and earlier this month renewed its call for the Ministry of Environment to come back to the table with a better deal.</p>
      <p>In an interview this week, Environment Minister Dustin Duncan gave no indication that is in the cards. He said the approval process is complete, and the First Nation should engage with the project’s <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/rio-tinto-exercises-diamond-mine-options-early">new proponent, Rio Tinto Exploration Canada Inc</a>.</p>
      <p>“They have a long track record and, I think, a pretty good track record in terms of community engagement,” Duncan said of the Anglo-Australian mining giant, which recently exercised its options to buy a 60 per cent stake in the project for $75 million.</p>
      <p>“From the regulator’s perspective, our work was to go through the process of signing off on this project no different than we would on any other project — and so from that standpoint, that’s been done,” Duncan continued.</p>
      <p>“Conditions have been attached to the project moving forward. And as a regulator, that’s really where our interest lies.”</p>
      <p>Winston McLean, a consultant who has been speaking for the First Nation on issues related to the proposed Star-Orion South project, said this week that he remains confident the province will change its tune and reopen discussions with the First Nation.</p>
      <p>Accommodations under the approval process include reserving a portion of the forest for band members’ use, community and environmental programs and a requirement that they be funded to the tune of $161,250 for each year of the mine’s life.</p>
      <p>While additional impact benefit agreements are typically signed between a community and a company once the decision to bring a project into production has been made, McLean said the province knows the First Nation is “talking about more than jobs.”</p>
      <p>“In this era of reconciliation it’s ironic that the accommodations the province is leaving us only seem to further the historic agenda of shoving Indians to the side so development can take place,” McLean said.</p>
      <p>“There are some interesting things that can be done, good things, such as finding ways to save sacred medicines, in the forest and use it as an opportunity to reclaim knowledge and culture that has been lost,” he added.</p>
      <p>Rio Tinto, which is continuing development of the site before making a final decision, has said it will continue to engage with First Nations groups and “work collaboratively with the local communities while we continue with exploration work.”</p>
      <p>Duncan also advocated that course, saying James Smith Cree Nation and Rio Tinto have expressed that they will be talking to each other, and that at this point negotiations are “really between the company and (the First Nation).”</p>
      <p>Shaun Spelliscy, the managing director of the exploration company Gem Oil Inc. who staked claims in the Star kimberlite field later sold to the project’s original proponent, Star Diamond Corp., said he doesn’t “see anything but a win-win” should the mine be developed.</p>
      <p>“If a mining development is to proceed in the provincial forest (Rio Tinto) is probably the best fit with James Smith based on what they’ve done in Mongolia and India as regards to training and mobilizing a local Indigenous workforce,” Spelliscy said.</p>
      <p>“The benefits are immense to have a company with as much international experience as (Rio Tinto) in charge of organizing things. For anything to work, both sides have to realize good faith, and sometimes even compromise, need to be part of the equation.”</p>
      <p>If it proceeds,<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/star-diamond-corp-shaves-510m-from-cost-of-building-mine-near-prince-albert"> the mine is expected to cost $1.4 billion to build</a>, employ 700 people continuously over its 38-year life and generate billions of dollars in corporate and municipal taxes, as well as royalties.</p>
