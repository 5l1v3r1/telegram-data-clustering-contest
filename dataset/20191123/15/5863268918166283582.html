      <p>KARACHI (Dunya News) – Police’s negligence has put the murder case of Nimrita Kumari – a final-year student of Bibi Aseefa Dental College – in limbo, Dunya News reported on Saturday.</p>
      <p>According to details, the police wrote a letter to the interior ministry on October 16 – one month after the killing – and forwarded fingerprints collected from 11 points for identification.</p>
      <p>The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) declared all samples unidentifiable owing to substandard quality. The Nadra has returned the samples to the police whereas the final report is likely to be issued next week.</p>
      <p>It is pertinent here to mention that Nimrita Kumari’s dead body was found from her college’s hostel room on September 16.  </p>
