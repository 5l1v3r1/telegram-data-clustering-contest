      <h1>Dolly Parton Explains Her Recent Focus On Christian Music: ‘I’ve Just Felt Like God Was Calling Me’</h1>

      <p>Dolly Parton has been nominated for dozens of Grammys over the years, but her nomination for the 2020 awards is indicative of a recent shift in her music toward faith-based music.</p>
      <p>Her collaboration with Australian duo For King &amp; Country, “God Only Knows”, received a nomination for Best Contemporary Christian Performance, and she opened up to <a href="https://people.com/country/dolly-parton-making-christian-music/"><i>People</i></a> about why she’s focusing on Christianity in her new music.</p>
      <p>“I’ve done so many things,” Parton tells the magazine. “And I see that I am in a position to help. People look at me like someone they’ve always known, like a mother or sister. If I say something good, people might listen.”</p>

      <p>She adds: “I’ve just felt like God was calling me into that. I’ve always felt like my music was more my ministry than a job. I just feel that this day and time, we need more people that are in a position to help to try to do something, if they can, to brighten the world a little bit. That’s what I’m hoping to do now.”</p>
      <p>Another recent collaboration is the track “Faith” with the DJ duo known as Galantis, which she says “came to me out of the heavens.”</p>
      <p>According to Parton, the pair “sent the song to see if I’d be interested, and I just loved it. So I did it. Now it’s out and people are really responding to it. It’s more of a dance song, as you know. But it’s a very spiritual message. It’s like God saying, ‘Have a little faith in me.’ So I was proud to be part of that whole thing.”</p>

      <p>In fact, the 73-year-old music icon believes she sees the hand of the Almighty at work in the way things have unfolded for her recently.</p>
      <p>“I felt really blessed because I had decided just in the last few months that I was going to try to do more faith-based things or at least more uplifting music,” she says.</p>
      <p>“Then right out of the blue came King &amp; Country and their ‘God Only Knows’. And then the Zach Williams song, ‘There Was Jesus’. All three of those just came and I went, ‘Well, that must be an answer.’ I’ve got three faith-based songs out now, which I feel very good about,” adds Parton. “Whether you believe in God or not, we need to believe in something bigger and better than what’s going on because we’re not doing too hot. We need to try to do a little better.”</p>
