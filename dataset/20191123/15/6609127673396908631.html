      <p>She has already hinted that her dress will be made by designer galialahav after posting on June 20 that the designer had "made the dress of my dreams".</p>
      <p>The ESPN reporter has cooed over her soon-to-be hubby since he signed for Rangers back in February.</p>

      <p>American beauty Held has since posted several snaps of herself and her man in Scotland, dawning a<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4448462/rangers-wag-brittany-held-blue-bikini-matt-polster/"> royal blue bikini on a recent trip to California.</a></p>
      <p>She also teased fans with a Drummond Castle 'engagement photo shoot' where she styled a white dress and posed romantically with her beau.</p>
      <p>Her captions are a clear sign she is a lady in-love, often referencing fairy-tales as she posts beautiful photos of the happy couple kissing.</p>

      <p>However, the dreic Scottish weather wasn't quite what her maid-of-honour had planned for the Bachelorette party as Brittany posted bikini-clad pics of her and her sister at Encore Beach Club, Los Angeles with a white feather bikini and praised the "rowdy-ass women" inn her life.</p>

        <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/celebrity/4429986/rangers-wag-brittany-held-bikini/">We shared pics of her back in June as she posted more racy snaps of her toned figure as she took some timeout to chill out on the beach in her native America.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Not one to get too carried away with the high-life, the reporter has often also shared snaps of her dining at casual-pizza parlour Paesano's and <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3934800/rangers-wag-brittany-held-louden-tavern-dundee-pub/">enjoyed pre-match pre-drinks in the Louden Tavern on Glasgow's Copland Road.</a></p>
      <p>The stunning duo have hinted they will marry on New Years Day, as she announced the 90 day countdown on October 4th.</p>
