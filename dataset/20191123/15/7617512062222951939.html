      <p>Ice-making activities will resume at the Alberni Valley Multiplex in Port Alberni after an ammonia leak shut down the rink three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Technical Safety B.C. issued a certificate of inspection to the City of Port Alberni that will allow the arena’s chiller to be placed back into service. The city is required to monitor the system to confirm the integrity of the repair. This will be done by ammonia and brine testing, combined with testing of the repaired welds.</p>
      <p>“As we’ve learned in B.C., even small leaks can quickly become very dangerous if the cause is not understood and effectively managed. All ammonia leaks must be reported to Technical Safety B.C. within 24 hours of occurrence, as per the Safety Standards Act,” says an update from Technical Safety B.C.</p>
      <p>In 2017, an ammonia leak at a rink in Fernie claimed the lives of three men. — Times Colonist</p>
