      <p>It was a sad day for residents and indigene of Obuda in Uratta Community, Aba South Local Government Area of Abia State as a commercial train passing through the community knocked down and ran over the body of a woman suspected to be pregnant.</p>
      <p>The incident which happened along the rail line that passed through the Obuda community left them in shock because according to some members of the community it was the first time such a thing is happening.</p>
      <p>The woman whose house is some kilometres to the scene of the incident was said to be heading for the city center to shop for what the family would eat this weekend.</p>
      <p>Sources within the accident area told our reporter that the husband of the deceased and her relations hurriedly came and evacuated her body to avoid the railway Police from taking custody of her remains, which may either cost the family more money before it could be released for burial.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness who gave his name as Mark told our reporter that it was a shocking watching the body of a young woman in early or mid forties being dragged and decapitated by the moving train.</p>
      <p>Mark blamed the accident on the commercial motorcyclist whom many accused of overspeeding,recekless and dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>“I was not that far from the accident scene. I was coming from the other end of Uratta road off Port Harcourt road.</p>

      <p>“Keke and other bikes parked on both sides of the road when they noticed that the train was close. Suddenly, this guy emerged from nowhere and before you could say Jack, the train was on the woman.</p>
      <p>“People on the other were saying that they overhead the woman hitting on the guy to stop. But it was too late. It was out of fear that she jumped out of the bike, but it was too late for any miracle to happen. The train dismembered her legs and ripped open her skull from the back.</p>
      <p>“Early Caller to the scene managed to lift up her decapitated body to see if there could be anyone that knows her.</p>
      <p>“We learnt that the husband is a butcher. She was said to have told someone that she was going to buy what the family will need for the weekend, but never knew that she was not going to return alive.</p>
      <p>“The Okada man ran away, but I think people know him. It was alleged that he (commercial motorcyclist) was listening to music or radio using a headphone. It hasn’t been long when the husband and the relatives of the woman came to remove her body before policemen from railway came. You know that if the railway police evacuate the body, they will find it hard to secure her body for burial,“ Mark stated</p>
      <p>Another road user who gave his name as Gilbert bemoaned reckless driving of motorists and motorcyclists after road rehabilitation the federal government.</p>
      <p>Gilbert and others, however, called on the railway authorities to ensure that they keep a personnel that will monitor traffic compliance by the motorists.</p>
      <p>“If they (Railway) had their flagman here or their crossbar, it would not have happened. The truth is that the okada man was reckless. Every other person would have done what that woman did. If it was a case of a car and okada, the impact would not have been much.”</p>
