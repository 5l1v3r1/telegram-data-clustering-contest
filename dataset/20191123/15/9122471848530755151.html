      <h1>Ryan Day Has Strong Message For Ohio State Fans Before Kickoff</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:25:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Two of the best teams in college football will battle this afternoon, when Ohio State hosts Penn State with the Big Ten East on the line. With kickoff approaching fairly soon, head coach Ryan Day shared a message to the fans that will be in attendance.</p>
      <p>Day had large shoes to fill this season as the head coach of the Buckeyes. Replacing a legendary coach like Urban Meyer isn’t an easy task by any means.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is a few wins away from solidifying its spot in the College Football Playoff. But first, the Big Ten powerhouse has to defend home field today against Penn State.</p>
      <p>In order to ensure that Penn State’s offense will have trouble communicating at the line of scrimmage, Day fired up the fans before the game.</p>
      <p>During the program’s Skull Session, Day said “This place has to be a living hell today.”</p>
      <p>He wasn’t done pumping up the fans at St. John Arena, as he also said “Every time their offense touches the football, it has to be louder than the Horseshoe has been.”</p>

      <p>That’s quite the message from the head coach of the Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>Home-field advantage has played a major role in this rivalry over the past few seasons. Ohio State has won the last three rivalry games at home.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out soon enough if the crowd at Ohio Stadium can disrupt Penn State this afternoon.</p>
