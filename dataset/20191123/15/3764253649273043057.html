      <p>Barcelona tried to restored parity before the half time break, but the duo of Kenneth Omeruo and Roberto Rosales were superb for Leganes at the back as the first half ended 1-0.</p>
      <p>Lionel Messi provided the assist that helped Luis Suarez restored parity for Barcelona in the 53rd minute of play.</p>
      <p>The Argentine would have double the lead for Barcelona five minutes later when he was set up by De Jong, but his shot was blocked.</p>
      <p>Arturo Vidal netted the winner for Barcelona in the 79th minute for the Catalans to record a 2-1 win and maintain their position at the top of the League standings.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Lionel Messi made a striking confession after revealing <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1268151-lionel-messi-life-contract-barcelona.html">he does not want a life contract</a> at Camp Nou despite his desire to remain at Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old's future at the club remains uncertain when club President Josep Bartomeu revealed that their captain has a clause in his contract which enables him to leave at the end of the season.</p>
