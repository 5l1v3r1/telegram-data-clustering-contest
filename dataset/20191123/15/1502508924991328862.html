      <p>The Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine on Saturday night filed a petition in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/supreme-court">Supreme Court </a>seeking quashing of the Maharashtra governor's decision to swear-in BJP's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>as chief minister and demanded an immediate floor test to avoid "further horse trading".</p>
      <p>The three parties also sought a direction to the governor to invite them to form government under the leadership of Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray saying they have the support of more than 144 MLAs.</p>
      <p>The petitioners alleged that the governor has acted in a "partisan manner" and has allowed himself to be a "pawn in the BJP's illegal usurpation of power".</p>
      <p>The parties further prayed for an "immediate floor test within 24 hours so as to avoid further horse trading and illegal maneuvers to somehow cobble up a majority from the MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi)".</p>
      <p>Their lawyer Sunil Fernandes said the petition has been filed with registry and a formal listing of the plea for hearing is awaited.</p>
