      <p>Kim Kardashian West said she cried “the whole way home” because of hurtful online memes that mocked the floral glove and gown ensemble she wore to the 2013 Met Gala.</p>
      <p>The Givenchy floral maternity gown was just one of several past looks the reality star and aspiring lawyer reviewed in a video for Vogue, from Juicy Couture sweatsuits to recent sleek looks she said were styled by her husband, Kanye West.</p>
      <p>However, the gown stood out as Kardashian West’s walk on the gala’s red carpet was mocked by Twitter users, some writing that it resembled to a busy floral couch print.</p>
      <p>“I was crying, like, the whole way home because I just couldn’t believe it,” Kardashian West said. “There were all these memes about me and this couch.”</p>
      <p>She noted that even the late actor <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/robin-williams-tweets-about-kim-kardashians-dress-2013-5">Robin Williams poked fun at the look on Twitter</a>, saying she looked like Mrs. Doubtfire. Williams seemed to be pulling from gossip blogger Perez Hilton’s fashion blog, which took aim at the reality star in a post entitled “<a href="http://perezhilton.com/cocoperez/2013-05-07-mrs-doubtfire-kim-kardashian-who-wore-it-better#.UYpqayu4GaM">Mrs. Doubtfire Vs. Kim Kardashian: Who Wore It Better???</a>“</p>

      <p>“It was like this whole thing, so I just cried,” Kardashian West said.</p>
      <p>The “Punk: Chaos to Couture” -themed gala came just weeks before Kardashian West gave birth to her and rapper Kanye’s first child, North.</p>
      <p>“I was very pregnant, very puffy, and bloated and I was like, “Oh god, of course the first time I go I’m gonna be huge,” she said.</p>
      <p>Kardashian West said the couple only appeared together because Kanye was performing, and she was his plus one.</p>
      <p>“That was okay with me because I never really dreamed I would be at the Met Ball,” she said. “I know no one really probably wanted me there at the time.”</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Kardashian West said none of the online backlash mattered, because fashion heavyweights Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen “loved” the look.</p>
      <p>“I just remember [Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen] came up to me and loved my outfit and my gloves,” she said. “So none of the critics mattered because the Olsen twins approved.”</p>
