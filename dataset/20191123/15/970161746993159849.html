      <p>Dan Osborne is making the most of his time without wife <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> while she takes part in I’m A Celebrity, as he took his children to the launch of the Christmas Grotto at Shrek’s Adventure in London.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old wrapped up warm for the weather in a tracksuit ensemble, as he was seen hand in hand with their little ones, Ella, five, and Mia, 17 months, and six-year-old Teddy, who he shares with ex Megan Tomlin.</p>
      <p>And the family seemed to be having the best day together as they prepared for the festive season, posing alongside Santa Claus, while Dan even wore some Shrek ears.</p>
      <p>We are also totally not jealous of Ella’s amazing rainbow face paint.</p>
      <p>Dan recently revealed he has plans to fly out to Australia to support his wife during her stint on the ITV reality series.</p>

      <p>‘I’ll be going out there though, not to go into the jungle but to support Jac,’ he told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10400532/dan-osborne-flying-australia-jacqueline-jossa-tearful-meltdown/">The Sun.</a></p>
      <p>And when asked about the prospect of facing a possible bushtucker trial, he replied: ‘Yeah, yeah, but I’d do it. I guess it depends on what it is.’</p>

      <p>Jacqueline also previously revealed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-didnt-tell-young-kids-heading-jungle-stint-11081701/">that she did not tell her children</a> that she was going to be entering the jungle, and it was going to be ‘really hard’ leaving them behind.</p>
      <p>‘This is definitely the longest I have ever been away from them and that is going to be really hard,’ she admitted.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t know how to face even telling them. In the end, I thought the best idea was to say, “Mummy is going away for work”, and I would see them soon.</p>

      <p>‘My family is so close-knit and I will miss them all terribly.’</p>
      <p>The former EastEnders star also said that one of the main reasons for signing up for the show was to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-insists-not-doormat-hits-back-dan-osborne-speculation-11081589/">dispel a misconception about her relationship with Dan</a> – and she wants us all to know that she is not a ‘pushover’, as some may think.</p>

      <p>‘I think people think I am a pushover or a doormat,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>‘I also think some people pity me. I want to show I am fine, I am up for a laugh and that I will for it and try my best.’</p>
