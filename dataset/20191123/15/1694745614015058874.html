      <h1>Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci Wage War in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman</h1>

      <p>This is not a drill, folks: Netflix's latest drama features a combination of talents that may in fact blow your mind. Academy Award winners <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Robert-De-Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Al-Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, and Joe Pesci star in the streamer's upcoming film <b>The Irishman</b>, directed by the one and only <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Martin-Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>. The film, which uses digital effects and makeup to de-age the actors to a dark witchcraft-like degree, follows De Niro as Frank "The Irishman" Sheeran, a World War II veteran and labor union leader who allegedly became a hitman for the Bufalino crime family and played a role in the disappearance of union activist Jimmy Hoffa. Pacino stars as the notoriously mob-connected union boss Hoffa, with a supporting cast that includes <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Anna-Paquin">Anna Paquin</a>, Bobby Cannavale, Ray Romano, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Harvey Keitel.</p>
      <p>Described as "an epic saga of organized crime in post-war America," <b>The Irishman</b> will catch your attention with its moody cinematography (thanks to the Oscar-nominated Rodrigo Prieto, who also shot Scorsese's <b>The Wolf of Wall Street</b> and Ang Lee's <b>Brokeback Mountain</b>) and intriguing gangster drama, but it's the VFX magic at work that will really catch your eye. Considering that De Niro's de-aged skin has the best postfacial glow we've ever seen, we can confirm that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Disney-Lion-King-Remake-Animated-45521891">not all CGI trickery is necessarily evil</a>. Check out the official trailer above, and look out for when <b>The Irishman</b> hits select theaters on Nov. 1 and premieres on Netflix Nov. 27.</p>
