      <h1>Dele Alli opens up on his talk with Jose Mourinho before impressive performance vs West Ham</h1>
      <h2>Mourinho got off to the perfect start as Tottenham beat West Ham 3-2 on Saturday in his first match</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:15:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Elliott Jackson</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur star Dele Alli has revealed that Jose Mourinho made a joke about him playing "like his brother" after he was appointed as the club's new manager.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach replaced Mauricio Pochettino this week after he was sacked after five years in charge of Spurs.</p>
      <p>Mourinho enjoyed the perfect start to management as he watched his side race into a 3-0 lead away at West Ham in his first match.</p>
      <p>The final score ended 3-2 but the win secured a first league away victory since late January for Spurs, who have struggled on the road in 2019.</p>
      <p>Alli was central to all good things about Tottenham's play, setting up the first goal for Heung-Min Son before showcasing an audacious bit of skill in the build-up for Lucas Moura to double their advantage.</p>
      <p>Playing in a more tailored number ten role behind Harry Kane, Alli looked back to his best after being afforded the license to express himself by Mourinho.</p>
      <p>However, after the match, Alli confirmed that reports detailing a discussion between the pair where Mourinho asked the Englishman if he was his brother or the real Dele Alli were true, in a bid to spur on Alli after his dip in form over the last 18 months.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, he made a joke about it but a lot of people have been talking about that for a few years so it's nothing new," Alli told BT Sport after the full-time whistle against West Ham.</p>
      <p>"Like I said, I think I've performed well this season despite the results. I haven't been playing that bad but I have to just keep getting better.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people have asked me or said 'when am I going to find my old form?' but I don't want to find that old form, I want to get better than that, improve and reach my full potential."</p>
      <p>He added: "You never know, people might think I played bad today, people might think I played good but, for me, we won, so I'm happy."</p>
