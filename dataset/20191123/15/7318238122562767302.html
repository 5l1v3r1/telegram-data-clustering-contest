      <p>Ukrainians are lighting candles in memory of the millions of people who died in Soviet Ukraine during the Holodomor of 1932-33.</p>
      <h3>What is Holodomor?</h3>
      <p>It was a famine that most historians consider was provoked by the repressive policies of Soviet policies.</p>
      <p>It hit peasants in Soviet Ukraine and some regions of Soviet Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>Joseph Stalin’s so-called “collectivisation” programme forced peasants to give up their land and property.</p>
      <p>The wealthiest were deported and collective farms were formed to take over the running of the land.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>This policy led to agriculture production drops and food shortages. Food requisitions by the state from collective farms and households followed, which led to people starving.</p>
      <p>Besides the famine of 1932-33, Ukrainians also suffered from other famines between 1921 and 1923 as well as 1946-1947. The term “Holodomor” often referred to those periods too.</p>
      <p>Holodomor is a term derived from two Ukrainian words: “holod” (hunger) and “mor” (extermination).</p>
      <h3>How many people died?</h3>
      <p>Historians cannot fully agree on this.</p>
      <p>Estimates range from almost two million to as many as ten million, but most scholars, both Ukrainian and international, put the figure between around 3 and 3.9 million deaths in Ukraine, with between 5.5 and 8 million people estimated to have perished across the USSR as a whole.</p>
      <h3>Was it a genocide?</h3>
      <p>This question divides researchers too. Many historians believe the Holodomor was a genocide against Ukraine as a nation due to the number of political decrees aimed specifically at Ukrainian peasants.</p>
      <p>Letters exchanged between communist party leaders reveal that at the time they were worried about Ukrainian peasants rebelling against the agricultural policy.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>After crop confiscations, special raids were organised to retrieve any hidden food supplies in households, while a travel ban was also put in place for Ukrainians, preventing them from searching for food elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Other scholars argue that mass-famine was a result of political decisions, but was directed at peasants in general rather than Ukrainians specifically.</p>
      <p>According to some of them, since a lot of Ukrainians lived in villages and worked on a very fertile ‘black soil’ they suffered most.</p>
      <p>Some of the historians even accuse the West of helping to provoke the mass famine by causing the price of grain crops to drop.</p>
      <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of politicising this question on multiple occasions. It insists it to be a common tragedy as other regions in the Soviet Union suffered too.</p>
      <p>This position was publicly shared by the former president of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich, ousted from power in 2014.</p>

      <p>The country’s law, however, recognises Holodomor as an act of genocide and has criminalised its denial since 2006, although no prosecutions for this crime have ever taken place.</p>
      <p>A recent survey by the Ukrainian sociological group Rating reveals that 82% of Ukrainians think that Holodomor was an act of genocide against the Ukrainian people. 11% of Ukrainian nationals don’t support this idea, while 7% are undecided.</p>
      <p>Abroad, more than 20 countries recognise Holodomor as an act of genocide against Ukrainians, among them Spain, Italy, Poland, Hungary, USA, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Mexico and Colombia.</p>
      <p>In a resolution in 2008, the European Parliament called Holodomor "an appalling crime against the Ukrainian people, and against humanity".</p>
      <h3>What were the peasants eating in the starving villages?</h3>
      <p>Food aid was sometimes sent from other regions but was often returned by the authorities.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>To survive, peasants were collecting frozen or rotten potatoes and onions left on the fields after harvesting.</p>
      <p>They were also catching and cooking mice, squirrels, cats, dogs, frogs, lizards and turtles.</p>
      <p>Pancakes and soups were made from nettle, orache, other kinds of weeds and flowers, cherry tree branches, ground apple and blackthorn wood, aspen and birch bark and old animal bones.</p>
      <p>There were thousands of cases of cannibalism, with little children often being victims.</p>
      <h3>Why is so little known about the tragedy of the Holodomor in the West?</h3>
      <p>After the first international reports, in 1933 the Soviet state denied foreign journalists access to the territories suffering from famine.</p>
      <p>Later, communist authorities drew the curtain over the question.</p>
      <p>It only started to be discussed again in the 1980s, notably after the Chernobyl disaster, which was covered-up by authorities.</p>
      <p>The Holodomor remains an open wound for Ukrainians.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The horrific testimonies from the period of mass starvation were passed within families from generation to generation, consequences of that experience still influencing society today.</p>
      <h3>How is the Holodomor remembered?</h3>
      <p>The Holodomor is remembered in Ukraine on the fourth Saturday of November every year.</p>
      <p>On this day many Ukrainians light candles at the windows of their homes.</p>
      <p>Both official and informal memorial events and prayer services are held across the country and by Ukrainians abroad.</p>
      <p>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyi, and other senior officials participate in Holodomor remembrance at the ‘National Museum of the Holodomor-Genocide’ in Kyiv.</p>
