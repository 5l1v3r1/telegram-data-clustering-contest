      <p>His crush on Guinevere (Elizabeth Lail) became something even more sinister when she became Joe's obsession.</p>
      <p>Viewers were hooked when they saw creepy Joe using social media and the internet to become close to her, even going so far as to remove any obstacle - including people - that stood in his way of getting to her.</p>
      <p>After a shocking series one finale, Joe is back and it looks as though he's got another woman in his sights.</p>
