      <p>The first trailer for the twelfth series of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> has dropped – taking fans on a whole new journey throughout all of time and space.</p>
      <p>The release of a ‘massive’ announcement regarding the new run of the show <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/doctor-teases-something-big-just-two-weeks-time-11074797/">has been teased for a few weeks.</a></p>
      <p>And the debut of the trailer on this day is no coincidence as the first-ever episode of the long-running sci-fi show first aired on November 23, 1963.</p>
      <p>The new run of episodes will mark Jodie Whittaker’s second stint in the TARDIS as the thirteenth reincarnation of The Doctor and see her reunited with her companions Yaz (Mandip Gill), Ryan (Tosin Cole) and Graham (Bradley Walsh).</p>
      <p>Showrunner Chris Chibnall (who was also responisble for penning crime drama Broadchurch) previously teased that<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/doctor-who-series-12-will-return-with-the-biggest-episode-the-show-has-ever-done-11188497/"> the new series will contain the ‘biggest episode’ in the show’s history</a>.</p>

      <p>The twelfth run of the show will arrive two years after the Broadchurch actress made her debut as the first female Doctor. Her first series piloting the TARDIS was a gargantuan success – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/08/doctor-whos-jodie-whittaker-lands-biggest-season-opener-for-show-in-decade-as-8-2-million-tune-in-8016221/">gaining the programme’s best ratings in over a decade</a>.</p>

      <p>Series star<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/doctor-whos-bradley-walsh-warns-fans-of-terrifying-new-monsters-ahead-of-series-12-11165580/"> Bradley Walsh also warned fans to expect some truly ‘terrifying’ monsters</a> when Doctor Who blasts back onto screens.</p>
      <p><b>Metro.co.uk</b> recently made a visit to Doctor Who’s base in Cardiff, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/you-have-to-feel-the-pressure-inside-doctor-who-series-12-from-old-monsters-to-juggernaut-shoots-11196363/">where the cast spoke about the ‘pressure’ of going bigger and better</a> in the new series.</p>
      <p>The run of episodes proves to be the most action-packed yet and The Doctor will also be joined by some very famous friends in the TARDIS too.</p>
      <p>It was announced that British acting legends<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/doctor-who-series-12-adds-lenny-henry-and-stephen-fry-as-guest-stars-and-it-almost-makes-up-for-no-christmas-special-11189758/"> Stephen Fry and Sir Lenny Henry had signed up for guest stints</a> on the BBC’s flagship fantasy show.</p>
      <p>The former QI host <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/doctor-series-12-stephen-fry-reveals-sweet-excitement-cast-guest-role-lenny-henry-just-excited-11196619/">has spoken about his ‘sweet excitement</a>’ he prepares to (maybe?) travel through space and time by Whittaker’s side.</p>
