      <h1>Basu denies nepotism charge</h1>
      <h2>‘If those who have studied under me are very good, I can’t do anything about it’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:29:41+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ayan-Acharya-6949/" target="_blank">Ayan Acharya</a></address>
      <p>A section of the Indian cricket’s fitness community has levelled allegations of nepotism at the national team’s former trainer Shanker Basu, who in turn refuted these claims. A group of trainers affiliated to the BCCI has accused Basu of backing his favourites — linked to a fitness centre he runs — for being appointed at the NCA.</p>
      <p>A trainer, who did not want to be named, said, “Most of the trainers in the current set-up are from the 2007-08 batch. Basu taught us and took our exams. He accredited us and now he’s saying all these theories don’t count.”</p>
      <p>Another trainer added: “I refuse to believe that despite being Australian Strength and Conditioning Association (ASCA) Level 2 certified coaches, we can’t get a job at the NCA. Those close to Basu are being preferred over people who have served for more than 10 years.”</p>
      <h3>Hits back</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile Basu has denied all the allegations and said: “I am the founder of Primal Patterns and I teach. That’s my primary job and if those who have studied under me are very good, I can’t do anything about it. So, if people I have taught get selected, one should question the panel and the process, not me... I recused myself from the panel and even asked my son to not apply for the job,” he said.</p>
      <p>“These courses, the CSCS, the ASCA, and UKSCA (United Kingdom Strength and Conditioning Association) have become popular in the last 10 years... I don’t certify people, I only help them study and nobody can stop me from doing that... the appointments in the Board are not my responsibility. I am happy to be a coach all my life,” Basu said.</p>
