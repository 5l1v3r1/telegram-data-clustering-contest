      <h1>What Roger Goodell Has Been Telling NFL Owners About Colin Kaepernick</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:23:05+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick has been out of the NFL for three seasons and it’s fair to say the league as a whole does not want him back. At least, the league’s owners don’t appear to want him back.</p>
      <p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is a different story, apparently.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/23/colin-kaepernick-had-quiet-ally-roger-goodell-his-nfl-tryout-still-unraveled/">The Washington Post is reporting</a> that Goodell has been an ally for Kaepernick, encouraging NFL owners to consider him.</p>
      <blockquote>While Kaepernick waited for an NFL team to call, according to multiple people familiar with his actions, the commissioner was encouraging teams to consider him.</blockquote>
      <p>Goodell can’t force NFL owners to sign Kaepernick, though (at least, not legally) and the QB has remained unsigned.</p>
      <p>“There’s not a month that’s passed where Roger hasn’t talked to some owner, somewhere, about, ‘Hey, there’s a quarterback out there that you could use,’” said University of California sociology professor Harry Edwards, a friend and unofficial adviser to Goodell, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/23/colin-kaepernick-had-quiet-ally-roger-goodell-his-nfl-tryout-still-unraveled/">told The Post.</a> “But he doesn’t hire anybody. He doesn’t draft anybody. He doesn’t sign anybody. He doesn’t put anybody on a roster. He serves at the sufferance of 32 owners, who themselves are at all kinds of disagreement about all kinds of issues.”</p>
      <p>Kaepernick worked out for NFL teams in Atlanta last weekend. He was originally set to work out at the Falcons’ facility in front of 25 or so teams. Kaepernick decided to move the workout to a local high school and opened it up to the media. Only seven teams had a presence at that workout, according to multiple reports.</p>
      <p>The quarterback has yet to receive any public interest following that workout, though two teams are interested in him, according to his attorney.</p>
      <p>“One who is legitimately in need of a quarterback who had a very poor showing on Sunday and has got an owner that I don’t think gives a sh-t,” <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/2-nfl-teams-reportedly-interested-colin-kaepernick">his attorney Mark Geragos said</a>.</p>
      <p>Some believe the Panthers are one of those teams. It’s unclear who the other would be.</p>

      <p>Kaepernick told the media following his workout that he’s been ready to play for three years and he’s been denied for three years. It doesn’t look like that is going to change anytime soon.</p>
