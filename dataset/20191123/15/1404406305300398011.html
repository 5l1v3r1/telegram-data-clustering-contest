      <p>Savage revealed she will be telling her side of the story via the platform Patreon and took to Instagram to post images that promoted her side of the story. Savage said, “<i>Things I am going to reveal that was [sworn] not to see the day of light — by NDA. I am risking my life for many others. This story is 18+, and only for a mature audience, I want to make sure my story is very detailed as I can remember. My first story, 'Where It All Started' is out now.”</i></p>
