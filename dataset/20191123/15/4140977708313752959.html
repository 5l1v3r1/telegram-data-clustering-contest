                <p>Arsenal’s Callum Chambers was penalised for a foul very close to Arsenal’s box. Southampton took their free kick very quickly and Danny Ings took advantage of an unaware defence and placed the ball to Leno’s right. The ball then ricocheted off the near post and into the goal.</p>

                            <p>However, Arsenal managed to pull the game back 10 minutes later. Kieran Tierney placed the ball in the penalty box to find Pierre- Emerick Aubameyang. The forward got the ball down and shot it only to hit Bertrand on the chest. While Arsenal were appealing for a handball, the ball landed on Lacazette’s feet who finished what Tierney and Aubameyang started.</p>
