      <p>A referent interview with Shigeru Miyamoto has been published by Japanese site The Nikkei. In the interview Miyamoto talks a little about the much-loved Mario series and says that he is now trying “to avoid casting Mario too rigidly, giving him freedom to explore different character scenarios.” This a change from the past, but we have seen hints of it with New Donk City in <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Super+Mario+Odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and to an extent <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Mario+Kart+Tour">Mario Kart Tour</a> which sees the characters racing in some real life locations such as Paris, etc. One of the reasons he has decided to do this is that he has “become more interested in creating greater opportunities for a larger audience to enjoy.”</p>
