      <h1>Alabama 5-Star QB Commit Has Insane Game In HS Playoffs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:18:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The Alabama Crimson Tide lost starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa to a dislocated hip – a season-ending injury for the Heisman Trophy candidate.</p>
      <p>With Tua out, the Tide must rely on backup quarterback Mac Jones over the final two weeks of the regular season. We don’t know if Tua will be back next season, but the Crimson Tide should have no trouble finding another star under center.</p>
      <p>Alabama currently holds a commit from the top dual-threat quarterback in the nation. Although he won’t be there until next season, the Crimson Tide have a bright future.</p>
      <p>Bryce Young, a five-star recruit, lit up the high school football world all season. However, when the playoffs rolled around, he decided to take it to the next level.</p>
      <p>The star quarterback threw for 520 yards and seven (yes, seven) touchdowns in the playoff semifinal on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Here’s just one of the seven touchdown passes.</p>

      <p>Young is the No. 21 player in the nation and the No. 3 player from the state of California in the 2020 class.</p>
      <p>Alabama’s run as a national power might not be coming to an end any time soon. Sorry for the fans who thought Nick Saban and company were falling out of their dynasty.</p>
      <p>Is Bryce Young the next great college football quarterback? We’ll find out.</p>
