      <p>A taxi driver has been shot and injured by a City of Cape Town Traffic Services officer, attached to the “Ghost Squad”.</p>
      <p>It is understood the incident took place on Friday after the taxi driver rammed the officer’s vehicle.</p>
      <p>According to City Safety and Security Executive Director Richard Bosman the officer tried to pull over a taxi driver on the N2 near Raapenberg Road, but the driver refused and rammed the officer's vehicle several times during a chase.</p>
      <p>“At the intersection of Washington and Jakes Gerwel, the driver jumped out of the van and ran towards Bonteheuwel. The suspect turned around and reached for something, and the officer drew his weapon and fired a shot, as he thought the suspect was reaching for a firearm,” Bosman says.</p>
