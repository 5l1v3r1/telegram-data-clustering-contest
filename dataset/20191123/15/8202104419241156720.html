      <h1>Review: Playhouse Creatures is an all-women story of survival</h1>

      <p>This show, starring five talented women, wouldn't wouldn't exist without the efforts of those it portrays. </p>
      <h3>There are no men in Greystone Theatre’s Playhouse Creatures. At the same time, they’re everywhere.</h3>
      <p>The play’s heroines are England’s Restoration actresses, an unlikely team of foul-mouthed urchins and well-mannered ladies united in fighting their way onto London’s biggest stages.</p>
      <p>It might as well be a tightrope. Men — cruel ex-lovers, the theatre owner and the king himself — are constantly trying to knock them off, delivering a reminder of who wasn’t and still isn’t welcome onstage.</p>
      <p>The show is set during the reign of King Charles II, who has generously permitted women to perform onstage — the catch being he tries to sleep with most of them.</p>
      <p>The play’s cast in fact were real people, though the play takes a few liberties with the history. Leading woman Nell Gwyn (Danova Dickson) is entranced by theatre’s glitz and glamour, climbing her way from vending oranges to the main stage. Despite the gorgeous costumes (courtesy of designer Beverley Kobelsky), there are ugly truths underneath — both in the actresses and their industry.</p>
      <p>Many of the leads are obsessed with status or revenge or reputation — except for the hilarious Doll Common (Janna Wigton), who serves as our <i>de facto </i>narrator and set of sober eyes.</p>

      <p>Each woman’s circumstances change incredibly quickly, which at times makes it hard to really get to know them. We burst through plateaus to huge shifts in tone and setting. The play is a dark comedy, but its emotional valleys are deeper than its peaks are high. That didn’t stop it from landing well-placed jokes on Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>Plays about theatre can be self-indulgent in the same way as films about cinema or, god forbid, books about journalism. Monologues dotting the play range from dull to incendiary. Highlights are a Scottish play excerpt from the seasoned Mrs. Betterton (a strong Bobbi-Lee Jones) and a heart-wrenching solo scene from Elizabeth Farley (Paige Francoeur) in the second act. The operatic transition music is, frankly, a bit much — there’s drama enough already.</p>
      <p>The play’s weakest points, ironically, are usually when the women on stage talk about men. The term “Playhouse Creatures” and the <a href="https://artsandscience.usask.ca/news/articles/3900/Greystone_Theatre_Playhouse_Creatures">advertisement</a> (which promises us a chance to “voyeuristically peek in” on their “dressing room antics”) are not-so-sly winks to the extremely depressing fact that the characters were viewed as sex objects rather than extremely talented people.</p>
      <p>But maybe “voyeur” is the right word. We’re peeking into a world we can’t really understand. We’re reminded, rudely and clearly, that this play about the past is still very applicable to the present. </p>
      <p>Maybe that’s the beauty of it. This show, starring five talented women, wouldn’t wouldn’t exist without the efforts of those it portrays.</p>
      <p><i>Playhouse Creatures </i>runs at the Greystone Theatre on the University of Saskatchewan campus until Nov. 30. Tickets are available online and at the door. The location is wheelchair accessible.</p>
