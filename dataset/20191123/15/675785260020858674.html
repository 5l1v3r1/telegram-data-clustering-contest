      <h1>M&amp;S unveil cheese advent calendar with a big cheddar Santa for Christmas Day</h1>
      <h2>You can now tuck into cheese every day in the countdown to Christmas thanks to Marks &amp; Spencer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:07:20+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>There's only one thing better than tucking into a chocolate treat every day in the lead up to Christmas, and that's eating cheese for 25 days straight.</p>
      <p>The dream has become reality thanks to the heroes at Marks &amp; Spencer who released a £15 cheesy countdown this week.</p>
      <p>The calendar includes 24 individually wrapped M&amp;S bite-size cheddars and a big special Santa cheese for Christmas day to mark the occasion in style.</p>
      <p>It's out now, available in selected stores only, meaning you can go through a few practice calendars to warm-up for the main event in December, because no one needs an excuse to eat more cheese.</p>

      <p>You will, however, need to make room to store the advent calendar in your fridge to ensure your daily treats stay fresh.</p>
      <p>The supermarket announced the release on social media, setting tongues wagging with its fans as the post got almost 5,000 comments on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> .</p>
      <p>One said: "This is not just any cheese advent calendar, it's an M&amp;S cheese advent calendar."</p>
      <p>Another tagged their friend to say: "If we don't have these and have a phone call every night to review each one then our friendship's just run its course."</p>

      <p>A third came up with the genius idea of pairing it with another calendar, commenting: "The ideal accompaniment for the gin calendar!"</p>
      <p>If cheese isn't really your thing, the supermarket has also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/shopping-deals/ms-selling-percy-pig-advent-20559263">released a Percy Pig advent calendar</a> , which is also on sale in stores now and costs £5.</p>
      <p>The treats have been transformed in the build up to December 25 with 24 milk chocolate oinkers to scoff down throughout the month.</p>
      <p>But fear not, the real reason we're all here is saved until the big, where a regular bag of Percy Pigs hides behind the final delicious door.</p>
      <p>And if you really want to complete the set, Colin the Caterpillar has undergone a festive make-over to turn himself into a must-have Christmas cake.</p>
      <p>Despite his yuletide transformation complete with Santa hat, Colin remains the same on the inside with the usual winning recipe, retailing for £10.</p>
