        <b>NICOLA Sturgeon has claimed Boris Johnson "does not deserve" to be Prime Minister.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The First Minister was speaking to voters while on the campaign trail making stops across the country ahead of the up coming election.</p>

        <figcaption>Nicola Sturgeon says Johnson doesn't deserve the role</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She branded the PM's actions, including illegally shutting down Parliament, as direct proof to why he shouldn't get to return to Number 10.</p>
      <p>Ms Sturgeon also accused the Johnson of 'pandering' to the Brexit party and pulling the conservative party to the far right.</p>
      <p>It comes after her appearance on a BBC Question Time special on Friday evening where she said could foresee a "less formal" confidence and supply arrangement with the Labour party if Jeremy Corbyn met her conditions on an independence referendum.</p>

      <p>The Scottish leader visited Leven in Fife today while campaigning and stopped at a hairdressing business to hear how staff are providing free trims for school children from low-income households.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of a campaign visit with SNP candidate Stephen Gethins, she said: "Boris Johnson simply doesn't deserve the chance to return to Downing Street as Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>"Everything he has done in his short time in the job - including his illegal shutting down of Parliament - shows that.</p>
      <p>"He is taking the Tories further and further to the right, pandering to the worst excesses of Nigel Farage and the Brexit party."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Gourock in Inverclyde, Richard Leonard will highlight the "tax cheat and wage cheat practices" of some multinational companies.</p>
      <p>He was to make the intervention outside an Amazon depot, as the party launches its Fair Tax Programme to make the City, big business and tax dodgers pay more of a fair share.</p>
      <p>Mr Leonard said: "For too long those corporations with the broadest shoulders and the deepest pockets have been allowed to exploit the taxpayer and their workers.</p>
      <p>"They use loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes while paying their workers poverty wages and at the same time companies like Amazon have been drawing on public money and claiming Regional Selective Assistance awards."</p>
      <p>The Scottish Conservatives will focus on plans to cut taxes for low and middle-income workers as Jackson Carlaw attends an event at the Orchard Park Hotel in Giffnock, East Renfrewshire.</p>
      <p>The party has also hit out at Ms Sturgeon's criticism of the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: "This is yet more high-handed preaching from a First Minister who seems to think she can tell Scots what to think, but never listens.</p>
      <p>"Nicola Sturgeon slams Boris Johnson, yet at the same time she is quite happy to usher Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10 - whose Labour party faces numerous accusations of anti-Semitism, and which has failed to respond properly to allegations of bullying in its ranks."</p>
      <p>A bicycle repair and recycling business in Stirling will host Patrick Harvie of the Scottish Greens, who will put forward plans to realign city and region deals around tackling the climate emergency, instead of focusing on road building.</p>
      <p>In St Andrews in Fife, Willie Rennie will focus on the party's anti-Brexit stance, declaring the party the "home of remain".</p>
      <p>An Amazon spokesman said: "We are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK - more than £18bn since 2010.</p>
      <p>"This investment helped contribute to a total tax contribution of £793m during 2018 – £220m in direct taxes and £573m in indirect taxes. This year we announced plans to create 2,000 new jobs in the UK, taking our total workforce to over 29,500.</p>
      <p>"We’re proud of our investment and contributions in the UK."</p>
