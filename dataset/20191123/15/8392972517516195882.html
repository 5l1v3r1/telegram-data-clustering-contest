      <h2>It comes in two different designs</h2>

      <p>Argos 'half' <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/christmas/">Christmas</a> trees are an absolute must for anyone with a naughty cat or dog who loves nothing more than to play with your brand new festive tree as soon as you get it through the front door.</p>
      <p>The high street chain's genius faux trees are on sale for less than £35, and you can choose from two designs.</p>
      <p>The trees are 6ft but the branches only start at 93cm, which means baubles, tinsel and fairy lights will be well out of the reach of pets and curious toddlers.</p>
      <p>The stand is included and the product weighs 6kg in total.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Two designs are available, including one that looks like it's been sprinkled with snow and a traditional green one.</p>
      <p>Oh, and you're in luck because they've both just been reduced, with the white tree now costing £33.75 (it was £45) and the green tree is now priced at £30.00.</p>
      <aside>Good quality, easy to put up and the dog and cats can't ruin it.</aside>
      <p>They've gone down a treat with Argos customers who have left more than 200 reviews raving about the festive product.</p>

      <p>One commented: "It is perfect! Good quality, easy to put up and the dog and cats can't ruin it. Doesn't take up much room which is a huge bonus plus it looks amazing. My husband was sceptical and thought it was pointless but has said "it was worth every penny".</p>
      <p>A second said it's been brilliant at keeping their pet dogs at bay.</p>

      <p>"We are really pleased with this tree. Didn't expect it to be as good. It looks great and so far both of our dogs have left it alone!"</p>
      <p>A third commented: "Gorgeous tree. Looks like an expensive designer one. Definitely buying another next year.. Don’t hesitate- buy it."</p>
