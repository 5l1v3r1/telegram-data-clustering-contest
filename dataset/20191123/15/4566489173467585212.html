      <h1>Suspect in Malta journalist's murder wants deal before talking: police sources</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T15:20:12+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 15:20</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>The main suspect in the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia wants a pardon before he tells all he knows about the killing, sources close to the investigation told AFP.</p>
      <p>Businessman Yorgen Fenech made the request -- for a pardon or some kind of immunity -- on Saturday, as police continued questioning him over his alleged involvement in the murder.</p>
      <p>Police sources said the businessman was later taken ill at the police headquarters and transferred to hospital for treatment. His condition is not known.</p>
      <p>The brazen 2017 assassination of Caruana Galizia, described by supporters as a "one-woman WikiLeaks", sparked outrage and protests in the Mediterranean island.</p>
      <p>The government repeatedly refused to open a public inquiry into the killing, but made a surprise U-turn in September.</p>
      <p>Fenech, who reportedly owns a company Caruana Galizia alleged of links to corruption, was detained on his yacht at dawn on Wednesday as he tried to sail away from Malta.</p>
      <p>Just a day earlier Prime Minister Joseph Muscat had promised to pardon a suspected middleman, Melvin Theuma, if he named the person who ordered the attack.</p>
      <p>Theuma was also hospitalised on Friday after complaining of pains, but was released a few hours later and taken back to the police headquarters for questioning.</p>
      <p>Investigators have described Fenech as "a person of interest" in the murder of Caruana Galizia, who used her blog Running Commentary to report on corruption in Malta.</p>
      <p>Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb blast near her home in the small village of Bidnija in northern Malta, on October 16, 2017. She was 53 years old.</p>
      <p>Three men already face trial for allegedly carrying out the killing, but the mastermind has not yet been identified.</p>
      <p>Fenech is now requesting a pardon or some form of arrangement to tell the police all he knows about the murder -- and possibly expose more people in connection with the case. The decision on whether to accept the request lies with Muscat.</p>
      <p>Fenech comes from a wealthy family with a sprawling business empire, from energy to hotels. A leaked Malta Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit (FIAU) report identified him as the owner of a company in Dubai called 17 Black.</p>
      <p>Caruana Galizia had written in her blog about 17 Black some eight months before her death, alleging it had connections to high-level Maltese politicians.</p>
      <p>On Friday, a police source said they were also questioning Fenech over possible links to money laundering and drugs.</p>
      <p>Muscat's offer of a pardon for Theuma is conditional on the information about the assassination being corroborated. So far, the information has satisfied investigators, sources told AFP.</p>
