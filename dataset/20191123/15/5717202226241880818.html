        <b>Toby Alderweireld has taken to Twitter to insist that Saturday’s win over West Ham United was just what Tottenham Hotspur needed, before paying tribute to the Spurs supporters.</b>

      <p>Jose Mourinho’s tenure has begun with a victory. Tottenham went into the game awaiting their first league win for almost two months. By half-time, it looked like that that run was about to end.</p>

      <p>Goals from Son Heung-min and Lucas Moura within the final 10 minutes of the first-half put Spurs 2-0 ahead. Harry Kane seemingly put the game beyond doubt four minutes after the break.</p>
      <p>However, West Ham would fight back and threaten to set up a tense finish. Michail Antonio came off the bench to get one back with 17 minutes remaining. The Hammers then had a goal disallowed for offside as stoppage-time loomed.</p>

      <p>They would get a second with seconds remaining. But the final whistle blew almost immediately after the restart, and Tottenham secured the three points.</p>
      <p>Mourinho may be disappointed that his side did not keep a clean sheet. But there were plenty of incredibly encouraging signs. A number of players were excellent, hinting that the Spurs squad are ready to respond to their new boss’ methods.</p>
      <p>And following the win, Alderweireld took to social media to express his delight about the win. He also sent a message to the fans.</p>
      <p>Here is Alderweireld’s message…</p>
