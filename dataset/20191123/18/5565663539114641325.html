      <p>It is with utter dismay that I read about Kasukuwere's comeback. There is nothing better that this man can bring to Zimbabwe. Maybe you are just writing to fuel a possible fallout between President Mnangagwa and Deputy President Chiwenga.<br/><br/>At the height of Zimbabwe's economic meltdown it's people like Kasukuwere who were involved in illicit foreign currency deal, depriving the masses of Zimbabwe and enriching themselves. He cannot even account for the vast wealth that he has amassed. Then you call him a Saviour. Is it because of his name.<br/><br/>Please write responsibly and stop promoting economic saboteurs to the throne.<br/><br/>ED is by far better than Kasikurwere because he's fighting corruption and making some economic reforms have been appreciated by the IMF though they will take time to impact positively on the socioeconomic livelihoods of Zimbabweans.<br/><br/>Thank you <br/><br/>Mafirakureva Chokwadi</p>
