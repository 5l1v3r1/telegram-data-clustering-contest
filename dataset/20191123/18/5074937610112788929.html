      <h1>SDA College of Education to create a resort on its campus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:19:43+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:19</time> by <a rel="author">Edmund Quaynor, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Asokore (E/R), Nov. 23, GNA - A marshy area on the campus of the SDA College of Education at Asokore near Koforidua would soon become a resort.</p>
      <p>The management of the College is collaborating with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and other agencies to turn the place into fish ponds and a birds watching site.</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by Mr Wisdom Blackson Agbanyo, Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the College at a media briefing at Asokore.</p>
      <p>He said the project is part of a plan to upgrade facilities at the college into a world class university college status.</p>
      <p>Professor William Kofi Koomson, the Rector of the College, said the classroom block of the College has been rehabilitated and provided with facilities to enhance study.</p>
      <p>He said tutors of the College have been trained under the Transforming Teacher Education and Learning Project(T-TEL) , a government of Ghana project with support from UK Aid to deliver on their mandate.</p>
      <p>Prof Koomson said the project also provided facilities for professional upgrading of the tutors and teaching staff.</p>
      <p>He said currently the College is building a new administration block which is expected to be completed next year.</p>
      <p>Prof Koomson said when the new administration block is completed, the old administration block would be converted into a hospital for the community.</p>
      <p>Prof Koomson said under the upgrading programme of the College, the former dining hall of the College has been rehabilitated and refurbished.</p>
      <p>He said the College has initiated plans to establish a poultry farm to produce dressed chicken and eggs for the cafeteria and a ten-acre cassava and plantain farm for the produce to be served at the cafeteria.</p>
      <p>He said the developments are being funded from internally generated funds of the College.</p>
