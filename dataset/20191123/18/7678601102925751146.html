      <h1>Ten Satpol PP officers fired after allegedly stealing Rp 32b from Bank DKI</h1>

      <p>Ten out of 12 Jakarta Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) personnel accused of stealing money from an ATM linked to city-owned lender Bank DKI have been terminated from the agency.</p>
      <p>They allegedly stole a total of Rp 32 billion (US$ 2.27 million) from the ATM as they continued to withdraw cash over the course of three months when they noticed their account balances remained unchanged after using the ATM.</p>
      <p>“Of the 12 personnel, 10 were non-permanent employees. They have been fired,” Jakarta Employment Agency’s head of control unit Wahyono said on Thursday, as quoted by <i>kompas.com</i>.</p>
      <p>The 10 personnel were officially terminated from their positions in the agency on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He said the remaining two officers were civil servants and that the decision whether to fire them would depend on an ongoing Jakarta Police investigation, in which the two officers were currently only witnesses.</p>
      <p>“If they are named as suspects, we will make them non-active temporarily. If the case then makes it way to the court and results in a certain verdict, then we can decide whether to fire them or not,” he added.</p>
      <p>Jakarta Police spokesperson Sr. Comr. Yusri Yunus said they had summoned 41 people for questioning but only 25 had appeared as of Friday.</p>
      <p>“Based on our initial investigation, there were allegedly 41 people who did it [illegally withdrew money from the ATM]. We have summoned all of them, but only 25 fulfilled our request for questioning,” Yusri said on Friday, as quoted by <i>kompas.com</i>.</p>
      <p>“Not all of them are Satpol PP officers,” he added.</p>
      <p>The police have yet to name the suspects since they are simultaneously probing a possible fault in the ATM system.</p>
      <p>Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan called on the police to thoroughly investigate the incident.</p>
      <p>“All crimes should be legally processed, no matter what,” Anies said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Previously, Satpol PP Agency head Arifin said the agency had opened its own internal investigation into the case and had questioned some of the alleged perpetrators.</p>
      <p>“Based on the information that I received from them, they withdrew money from the ATM but later realized that the balance in their accounts remained unchanged. So they did it again,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s possible that they were just confused, so that’s why they continued [to withdraw money] over and over again,” he added.</p>
      <p>The officers reportedly continued to withdraw cash between May and August of this year until the bank noticed the loss of about Rp 32 billion, according to <i>tempo.co</i>.</p>
      <p>Arifin questioned how Bank DKI’s security system allowed the incident to happen. He wondered why the bank had only reported the irregularities months after the event took place.</p>
      <p>“Why is [Bank DKI] making a fuss now? Also, I question their security system. [The officers] received their salaries through Bank DKI, so they withdrew cash but their balances remained unchanged,” he said.</p>
      <p>In response to the incident, Bank DKI corporate secretary Herry Djufraini said the case was not theft and had not affected other accounts.</p>
      <p>“When the case emerged, we immediately coordinated with the police,” he said in a statement made available to The Jakarta Post. (vla)</p>
