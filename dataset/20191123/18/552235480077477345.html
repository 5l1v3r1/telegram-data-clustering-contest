      <p>An <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/third-scottish-kids-overweight-due-20169539">overweight</a> football fan who hit rock bottom has turned his life around thanks to one of his favourite Scottish Premiership players.</p>
      <p>After going sober around 10 years ago, Graham Wilson, 42, turned to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/food-drink/former-mcdonalds-workers-reveal-customers-20723826">fast food</a> and his weight ballooned to 18 and a half stones.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/colin-weir-completes-partick-thistle-20925027">Partick Thistle</a> fan Graham watched his fitness and mental health plummet to an all time low.</p>
      <p>That was until one of his favourite players, Chris Erskine, offered to become his personal trainer.</p>
      <p>In just one year, Graham, from Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, has lost over five stones and says he's happier than ever after the midfielder helped get him in shape and restored his confidence.</p>

      <p>Project sales worker, Graham, told the Record: "I used to suffer problems with alcohol which I now share in my blog.</p>
      <p>"But when I first went sober, I was still dealing with low self-esteem and mental health problems.</p>
      <p>"I went from drinking pints to forget about my problems, to eating chocolate and crisps.</p>
      <p>"I felt so low, I hated myself and didn't want to set foot in a gym."</p>
      <p>A lifelong Thistle fan, Graham got chatting to a fellow member of Kris Doolan's testimonial committee.</p>

      <p>From there he was introduced to Chris, 32, who at the time played for the Jags.</p>
      <p>He'd also started offering personal training sessions.</p>
      <p>"At first I was so daunted at the thought of training with Chris," Graham added.</p>
      <p>" I was so embarrassed in how I looked and my lack of strength, allowing a player I admired to witness it.Â </p>
      <p>"But Chris was amazing from day one, I had to put my Patrick Thistle goggles aside and work hard.</p>
      <p>"In the end, our love of Thistle brought us together.</p>
      <p>"Now, we're good pals and go out socialising together.</p>
      <p>"He saved me from a dark place."</p>

      <p>One year later Graham has turned his life around but didn't realise how much weight he'd lost till a recent holiday.</p>
      <p>He said: "This time last year my wife Carol-Ann, 42, and I went to Mauritius on holiday and I couldn't even take my top off.</p>
      <p>"This year was different, I felt really confident and I lot of that is down to Chris.</p>
      <p>"He's now at Livingston, but starting this journey with a Partick Thistle hero makes it all that bit better.</p>
      <p>"To anyone scared of going to the gym, just start small and don't worry about what other people think."</p>
