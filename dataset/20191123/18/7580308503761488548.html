      <p>Gonzalo Higuain grabbed a second-half brace with Paulo Dybala adding a late third as Juventus rescued a 3-1 comeback win over Atalanta in the final quarter of an hour to stay top of Serie A on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Robin Gosens had nodded Atalanta ahead after 56 minutes as the Bergamo side chased their first Serie A win over Juventus since February 2001.</p>
      <p>But Higuain hit back with two goals in an eight-minute spell while Dybala marked his 200th Serie A appearance with the final goal two minutes into injury time.</p>
      <p>Maurizio Sarri’s side open up a four-point lead on second-placed Inter Milan, who travel to Torino later on Saturday, as Atalanta drop to sixth place after their fourth league game without a win.</p>
      <p>“We suffered, but in the final 20 minutes we gave everything we had to bring the game home,” said Sarri.</p>
      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo missed the trip to their northern rivals despite his four-goal spree for Portugal as he recovers from a slight knee problem ahead of Juventus’s Champions League game against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In the absence of the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, Argentine strike duo Dybala and Higuain ensured the eight-time reigning champions maintained their unbeaten run this season despite several controversial refereeing decisions.</p>
      <p>“I hope Cristiano will be back for the Champions League on Tuesday,” said Sarri. “We’re solving this knee problem that has been bothering him for a while.</p>
      <p>“Playing with a hint of pain will tire you out psychologically.</p>
      <p>“So far he has trained in the right way, so as not to overload his knee.”</p>
      <p>Higuain had pulled Juventus level after 74 minutes with a ball that took a deflection off Rafael Toloi to beat Pierluigi Gollini in the Atalanta goal.</p>
      <p>The Argentine completed his double when he picked up a cross from Juan Cuadrado on 82 where the Colombian put his hand on the ball during a sliding tackle at the start of the move.</p>
      <p>Then Dybala broke through the Atalanta defense to finish off for his fourth Serie A goal this season.</p>
      <p>“It was a great test of maturity in a difficult field, three fundamental points for the championship,” said Higuain, who has scored 11 goals in as many games against the Bergamo side.</p>
      <p>“There are still three days before the Champions League, we need to rest to give the best of ourselves.”</p>
      <p><b>‘Lottery’ </b><br/>Atalanta had their chances with Musa Barrow missing an early penalty.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old Gambian rattled the crossbar after 17 minutes following a penalty awarded for a Sami Khedira handball.</p>
      <p>“Atalanta had perhaps their best performance this season and deserved to win, until that unlucky equaliser, then everything changed,” said Atalanta coach Gian Piero Gasperini.</p>
      <p>“That was the turning point. In the end, the quality of Juve overturned the result”.</p>
      <p>Atalanta lost out on some refereeing decisions including a disputed Emre Can handball, which did not result in a penalty.</p>
      <p>“I saw the action again. There is so much confusion nowadays on handball,” said Gasperini.</p>
      <p>“Emre Can’s handball seemed very clear to me, but it was evaluated differently.</p>
      <p>“The penalty we were awarded was the kind of challenge I’d have been furious to see given against me.</p>
      <p>“The interpretations are completely different between players and referees, a common line is needed. If there is no clarity, it becomes a lottery.”</p>
      <p>Inter will be looking to make it a perfect seven league games on the road this season as they travel to Torino.</p>
      <p>Serie A runners-up Napoli, in seventh, desperately need a result at 14th-placed AC Milan, who are themselves floundering.</p>
