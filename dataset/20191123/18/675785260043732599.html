      <h1>Strictly star Kelvin Fletcher's incredible love story and plans for huge family</h1>
      <h2>The former Emmerdale star is one of the favourites to win the Glitterball and his biggest fan is his wife, Elizabeth, and their two children Marnie and Milo</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Ex-Emmerdale star Kelvin Fletcher has won an army of new fans with his Strictly dance floor moves.</p>
      <p>The hunky actor has consistently been close to the top of the leaderboard, wowing judges with the shapes he's been throwing with pro partner, Oti Mabuse.</p>
      <p>And Kelvin is making sure he's taking his training regime VERY seriously now he's one of the favourites to win the Glitterball trophy.</p>
      <p>His training day starts at 5am and he works with Oti for 12 hours a day to make sure he knows their routine perfectly.</p>
      <p>Kelvin has also increased his daily calories to a whopping 3,000 and always drinks four litres of water a day.</p>

      <p>He said: "I’m on my feet all day. It’s quite tiring, so I’ve always been quite pro carbs – I think they’re a great thing. I probably eat about 300-350g of carbs a day.</p>
      <p>"About 160g of protein, about 60-80g of fat, which I think is about 2,500-3,000 calories.</p>
      <p>"Carbs get a bad press, but they’re pretty important. I’ve stayed pretty lean, I’m about five kilos lighter than I was a couple of months ago.</p>
      <p>"Which is fine, I think – it helps with the dancing."</p>
      <p>After learning his routine every Monday, Kelvin makes sure he knows it off by heart by Tuesday lunch time.</p>

      <p>The rest of the week is then spent making sure every step is perfect.</p>
      <p>But all of this training is keeping Kelvin away from the love of life, wife Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>The couple have known each other since they were children and finally got together around 10 years ago.</p>
      <p>And almost exactly four years ago, on November 28, 2015, Kelvin and Elizabeth tied the knot at a stunning wedding at One Mayfair in London.</p>
      <p>But Kelvin always knew Elizabeth was the girl for him.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2019110980308/kelvin-fletcher-wife-liz-marsland-wedding-hello-exclusive/">Hello</a>: "I knew I wanted to marry Liz omn the day I met her."</p>
      <p>Their wedding venue was transformed into a magical wonderland and filled with white roses and candles.</p>
      <p>But nothing was as stunning for Kelvin as seeing his bride make her way up the aisle towards him.</p>
      <p>He said: "She took my breath away. She looked so beautiful."</p>
      <p>Elizabeth, who has been good pals with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> star Michelle Keegan, also reduced her friend to tears when she saw her in her gown.</p>
      <p>Michelle said: "I was sitting with friends and we burst into tears when we saw her."</p>
      <p>Kelvin finally popped the question because the couple wanted to start a family.</p>
      <p>Since their wedding, they have had daughter, Marnie, and son, Milo.</p>
      <p>But there are big plans for the Fletchers, with Kelvin admitting he would like at least five children.</p>
      <p>He said: "We didn't need a piece of paper to prove anything because we know we love each other."</p>
