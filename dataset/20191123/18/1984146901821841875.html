      <p>A quarter of women in the North East haven’t had their smear test done, shocking figures reveal.</p>
      <p>New<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nhs"> NHS </a>statistics published show that 682,600 women should have had the screening done as of 2018/19.</p>
      <p>But 170,650 hadn’t had the test.</p>
      <p>It means more than one in four (or 25%) eligible women have missed out on what could be a life-saving screening.</p>

      <p>Just 75% of women had been screened as of 2018/19 - far below the national target of 80%.</p>
      <p>The rate of women missing out their smear test was even higher among women aged between 25-49 (25.8%) compared with those aged between 50 and 64 (23.7%).</p>
      <p>Campaigners blasted funding cuts for cancer campaigns as “highly frustrating”, especially because the benefits can be “significant” in areas where low attendance is prevalent.</p>
      <p>And regional campaigners are urging women to get their smear tests done.</p>
      <p>‘Amber’s Law’ is a charity that raises the profile of cervical cancer following the tragic death of Amber Rose Cliff, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a>, at the age of 25.</p>
      <p>She died on January 8 2017 after repeatedly being refused a smear test and now her family raise awareness of the importance of screening.</p>
      <p>Following Amber’s death, her brother Josh and his family launched the Amber’s Law campaign, calling for reform to how cervical cancer screening for young women works.</p>

      <p>The campaign, which was backed by ChronicleLive, received national attention and a petition set up in Amber’s name has garnered more than 380,000 signatures to date.</p>
      <p>After setting up the campaign Josh said: "It’s amazing that people who are eligible for a smear test aren’t taking them.</p>
      <p>"We have been contacted by a lot of women whose smear test had been overdue then read about Amber.</p>
      <p>"After taking the test it revealed abnormal cells which were able to be treated. It shows why smear tests should not be overlooked."</p>
      <p>Amber's dad Darren, 54, of Sunderland, said: "It is hard for me to comprehend why women don't take up a smear test. It is five minutes or less and it can save a life. Life is so precious, I don't understand why they don't do it.</p>
      <p>"The NHS provide free smear test for the over 25s and it is so important to attend."</p>
      <p>All women aged between 25 and 64 are invited for regular smear tests, which aim to spot abnormalities that could develop into cervical cancer if undetected and left untreated.</p>
      <p>Those aged between 25 and 49 should have been screened within the past 3.5 years while those aged between 50 and 64 should have been screened within the past 5.5 years.</p>
      <p>Newcastle had the highest rate across the North East of women who’d missed out on screenings - at 32.1%, followed by Middlesbrough (31.5%) and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/hartlepool">Hartlepool</a> (26.6%).</p>

      <p>The tests are free on the NHS and usually take less than five minutes to complete.</p>
      <p>While there was a spike in screening following the death of high-profile media star Jade Goody in 2009, in recent years the rate of women having smear tests has been falling.</p>
      <p>Robert Music, chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: "We remain far below the 80% target and have a long way to go.</p>
      <p>"Among young women, it remains under two in three booking a potentially life-saving test and big variations across ages demonstrate the need for targeted activities to tackle the different barriers across the life course.</p>
      <p>"Funding for national Be Clear on Cancer campaigns has been cut and this is highly frustrating.</p>
      <p>"There are areas of the country where under half of the eligible population are being screened and we know the benefits of these campaigns can be significant."</p>
      <p>Across England, 15.2 million women aged between 25 and 64 should have had a smear test done as of 2018/19.</p>
      <p>But 4.3 million of these women had not - a rate of 28.1%.</p>
      <p>While that was a slight improvement from 28.6% the year before, it remains the second-highest rate on modern record.</p>
      <p>Comparable figures go back as far as 2010/11, when 24.9% of women missed out on the screening.</p>
