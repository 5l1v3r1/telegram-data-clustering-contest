        <b>Phillip Cocu believes his side’s analysis of Preston North End is what gave them the edge at Pride Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Martyn Waghorn’s goal in the first half proved decisive, turning the ball home at the far post after Curtis Davies had flicked on Tom Lawrence’s corner.</p>
      <p>Preston were not without their chances, Tom Barkhuizen having a goal ruled out for offside and Jordan Storey hitting the post.</p>
      <p>But despite having the better of the second half, North End were outclassed in the opening 45.</p>
      <p>Cocu believes that the opening exchanges was right up there with the best that that he has seen from his side.</p>
      <p>He said: “We knew it’d be a difficult game, three wins in a row, second in the table, everyone fit.</p>
      <p>“They played with the line up they use most of the time, they’re not an easy team to play.</p>
      <p>“But we really analysed well how they played and what they try to achieve in order to get into their favoured positions.</p>
      <p>“The back four and also the two holding midfielders were very important in that aspect today</p>
      <p>“It was one of the best 45 minutes I’ve seen from the team.</p>
      <p>“A great combination of a tactical execution of the game plan, loyalty in keeping doing what we wanted to do and showing everyone that we enjoy playing together as a team.</p>
      <p>“With the balls, the movements, the touches.</p>
      <p>“That’s what you want to see from the team.”</p>
      <p>With Preston’s resurgence in the second half, the Rams were under pressure for longer periods of the game.</p>
      <p>The County boss would have liked to have seen his side increase their lead and put North End out of the game as he thought anything less than a win would have saddened him.</p>
      <p>“We could have made it easier for us if we’d have scored another goal because then it breaks the opponent’s resistance.</p>
      <p>“You saw with the 1-0, around 72 minutes, we were getting back and couldn’t really place a real dangerous counter attack.</p>
      <p>“But the team recognises this better and better so you don’t force it, to go forward with it.</p>
      <p>“You just try to keep your organisation and if you don’t score the second done you make sure you keep a clean sheet.</p>
      <p>“This is a positive development.</p>
      <p>“Some players were really active on that part of the game in this game.</p>
      <p>“It would have been a shame to have a draw here when you play 60 minutes of great football.”</p>
