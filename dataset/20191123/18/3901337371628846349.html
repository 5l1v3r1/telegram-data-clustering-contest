      <p>Manchester City will be hoping to get their Premier League campaign back on track when they host Frank Lampard's in-form Chelsea this afternoon - Here's how they line up.</p>
      <p>
        <b>English Premier League</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Teams:</b> Manchester City v Chelsea</p>
      <p><b>Date</b>: 23 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue</b>: Etihad</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola's troops will be licking their wounds following a 3-1 loss to league leaders Liverpool before the international break.</p>
      <p>The defeat saw the defending champions drop nine points behind Jurgen Klopp's men after only 12 games played this season.</p>
      <p>One team who took advantage of City's slip up is Chelsea, who moved up to third spot with a 2-0 triumph over Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>Since the defeat to Liverpool a Stamford Bridge back in September, Lampard's have gone on to win six straight league encounters.</p>
      <p>City will be a man less as Bernardo Silva serves his one-game suspension for a controversial tweet about teammate Benjamin Mendy.</p>
      <p>The Citizens will have fond memories of this fixture last season as they ran out 6-0 winners, with Sergio Aguero starring with a hat-trick.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's how they line up:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Manchester City: </b>Ederson, Cancelo, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy, Rodrigo, David Silva, Mahrez, De Bruyne, Sterling, Aguero.</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea: </b>Kepa, Azpilicueta, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson, Kante, Jorginho, Kovacic, William, Pulisic, Abraham.</p>
