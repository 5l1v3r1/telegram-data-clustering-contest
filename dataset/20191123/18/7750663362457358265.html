      <h1>Rory McIlroy back in Dubai contention</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rory-mcilroy/"><b>Rory McIlroy</b></a> was delighted with his Dubai comeback after climbing to within two strokes of joint leaders John RahmÂ and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mike-lorenzo-vera/"><b>Mike Lorenzo-Vera</b></a> at the DP World Tour Championship.</h2>

      <p>McIlroy followed his opening 64 with a second-round 74, but hit back by posting five birdies and an eagle on the seventh hole in a bogey-free round of 65 on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"That's what life is all about," McIlroy told Sky Sports Main Event after moving to 13 under par.</p>

      <p>"It's learning from what you do and being of a present mind so that you can learn as you go.</p>
      <p>"I sort of figured out what I did wrong (on Friday) and I was able to rectify it somewhat and get myself back in the tournament.</p>
      <p>"I've got to play another really good round of golf to have a chance, but it would be awesome to win around here again and obviously cap off what has been a great 2019.</p>
      <p>"It is nice to come back to courses that you're familiar with all the time and that brings its own advantages compared to maybe some of the other guys in the field.</p>

      <p>"It's been a great year so far and this is my last event of the year. It would be wonderful going into the break to finish on a high."</p>
      <p>McIlroy, who is chasing a third victory at the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, headed into the weekend six shots off overnight leader Lorenzo-Vera.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman dropped a shot on the 18th after four birdies to finish with 69, while Rahm hit seven birdies and one bogey for a 66.</p>
      <p>Rahm, who would become the second Spaniard after Severiano Ballesteros to win the Race to Dubai title, said: "I'm really confident off the tee, I'm really confident with every part of my game right now.</p>

      <p>"I'm hitting a lot of greens and giving myself chances. Every time I hit one close I'm confident that I can make it.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people are playing good, hopefully I can keep this going for 18 more holes and be the last man standing."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tommy-fleetwood/"><b>Tommy Fleetwood</b></a> sits four shots back in fourth place on 11 under after three birdies and a bogey in a third-round 70.</p>
      <p>The Englishman, winner of the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa last week, is hoping to win a second Race to Dubai title in three years.</p>
      <p>Fleetwood needs to at least catch Rahm to have any chance of being crowned Europe's number one.</p>

      <p>"There's one tournament going on and then there's the Race to Dubai going on," he said. "I think it's just an extra challenge, that's all.</p>
      <p>"So far, I feel like I've done a great job of it.</p>
      <p>"I've been lucky enough that I've been doing this for three years in a row now coming to this event, so I'd like to keep that track record going and tick a few off."</p>
      <p>Belgium's Thomas Pieters is fifth after carding a second-successive 68, one ahead of Sweden's Marcus Kinhult, who also hit 68 on Saturday.</p>
