      <p>Boreham Wood threw away a two-goal advantage to draw 2-2 at Hartlepool in the Vanarama National League.</p>
      <p>The visitors took the lead from the penalty spot in the 26th minute, with Sorba Thomas stroking home.</p>
      <p>Wood doubled their advantage after the break, with Brentford loanee Justin Shaibu playing in Kabongo Tshimanga and he put away a second.</p>
      <p>Tyrone Marsh thought he had scored a third for the hosts six minutes later but his effort was ruled out for offside.</p>
      <p>Hartlepool, who had Dave Challinor in charge of a home game for the first time, pulled one back in the 70th minute when Ryan Donaldson teed-up Nicky Featherstone to slot the ball into the corner.</p>
      <p>Pools levelled from the spot with six minutes remaining after a foul in the box by Marsh, with substitute Gime Toure stepping up to score, but they could not find an unlikely winner.</p>
