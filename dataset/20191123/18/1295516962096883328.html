      <p>Marvel Comics is going all-in on its <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/x-men">X-Men</a> relaunch. Once the <i>House of X</i> and <i>Powers of X</i> miniseries wrapped up, the publisher unveiled its Dawn of X lineup including <i>X-Men</i>, <i>Excalibur</i>, <i>Mauraders</i>, <i>X-Force</i>, <i>New Mutants</i> and <i>Fallen Angels</i>.</p>
      <p>Each title tackles a different theme in the X-Men's new status quo, from their home base on the island of Krakoa to the smuggling of new pharmaceutical drugs across the world. Marvel isn't stopping there with its X-Men spinoffs, as we have titles for Wolverine, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/jonathan-hickman-promises-moira-x-series/">Moira MacTaggert</a> and X-Corp on the way.</p>

      <p>The reveal of an <i>X-Corp</i> comic came as a surprise after the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-stealth-announces-x-corp-series/">stealth announcement</a> inside the letters page of <i>Captain Marvel</i> #11. Artist Carmen Carnero penned a heartfelt goodbye to the readers of <i>Captain Marvel</i>, where she announced she was leaving the series to begin work on <i>X-Corp</i>. "Don't let Carmen out of your sights! Follow her into the pages of X-CORP, the latest in the wave of genre-defining X-Men books! Issue #1 is on sale February 2!" a note from editorial said.</p>
      <p>Little is known regarding <i>X-Corp</i>, aside from its debut on Feb. 2. However, a preview for next week's <i>New Mutants</i> #2 gives readers our first <i>X-Corp</i> namedrop after Sunspot tries to get the team out of a tricky situation.</p>

      <p><i>New Mutants</i> #1 concluded with the team becoming prisoners of the Shi'ar after they were betrayed by the <a href="https://screenrant.com/xmen-new-mutants-starjammers-comic/">Starjammers</a>. The whole point of the mission is so Sunspot can be reunited with his best friend, Cannonball, who is living with his family out in space. Sunspot wants Cannonball to see all the glories that Krakoa has to offer mutants. Before leaving Earth, Sunspot assembles his human lawyers to get his affairs in order, just in case he's gone too long.</p>
      <p>"I went to see my Earth lawyers to make sure all things X-Corp would be in good hands if this takes longer than I think it will," he says. Whatever <i>X-Corp</i> is shaping up to be, it is now clear that Sunspot will play a role in the ensemble series. If the "Corp" in the title is short for "Corporation," then Sunspot may be the person who is funding the team. After all, if the X-Men are now an independent nation, then they will need to establish an economy, which he can help them do.</p>
      <p><i>X-Corp</i> is just one of the many X-Men titles fans have to look forward to over the next few months. From solo titles like <i>Wolverine</i> to team-ups in <i>Giant-Size X-Men</i>, the future is looking bright for Marvel's Merry Mutants.</p>
