      <p>V.I.A. reader Richard Schell sent in the above photograph and a pretty great story to go with it.</p>
      <p>Schell lives in the Olympic Village and was running errands this past Thursday afternoon when he saw a police car stop in the middle of the road, blocking traffic with its flashing lights on.</p>
      <p>As he tells us, a man on a mobility scooter had broken down in the middle of 2nd Avenue.</p>
      <p>“He was stuck and immobile in the middle of the busy, busy traffic” said Schell, “I wanted to help push the scooter with them but traffic was so heavy and did not want to impede on their quick response.”</p>
      <p>VPD officers stopped traffic, then pushed the man safely to the other side of the street.</p>
      <p>He thought “Wow, this is incredible to see. The quick actions taken by the VPD to help this man was very nice to see when there is a lot of negative things they tend to on a daily basis.”</p>
