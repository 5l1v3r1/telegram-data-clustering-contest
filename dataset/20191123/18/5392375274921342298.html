      <h1>ColorOS 7 beta will reach Realme X2 Pro and XT in India soon</h1>

      <p>The first reports about ColorOS 7 arrival on the Realme X2 Pro and Realme XT emerged yesterday. According to these reports, both smartphones will get the new version of <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Oppo">Oppo’s</a> traditional skin on December 18 in China. Now, new reports indicate that users of these two devices will also receive the beta update pretty soon in India.</p>
      <p>The information is as official as it could be since it was shared by no one else than Realme’s India CEO Madhav Sheth. He made the announcement through a <a href="https://twitter.com/MadhavSheth1/status/1197827540892758016">twitter post</a> where he also will reveal the update timeline for ColorOS 7 (Realme Edition) on November 25. Worth noting that the Realme smartphones will reveal a custom version of ColorOS 7. According to the CEO, this version will be closer to vanilla Android.</p>

      <p>Oppo took the wraps off ColorOS 7 earlier this week and the update will start to roll out for Realme phones on November 25 and Realme devices from February 2020. Interestingly enough, this schedule only applies to the Chinese market. Other markets should follow a different timeline. For instance, Realme smartphones in India should start to receive it before the end of this year.</p>
      <p>We expect to hear more about the update’s arrival in India next week. Besides the new features, Realme fans are hoping that the referred update also brings Android 10 for some smartphones. If Realme decides to follow Xiaomi’s footsteps with MIUI, updating the ColorOS version doesn’t necessarily mean that a new Android version will reach all Realme devices.</p>
