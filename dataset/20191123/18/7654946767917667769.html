      <h1>Widow of NYPD officer Anthony Mosomillo heartbroken to learn killer’s gal pal granted parole</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:22:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:22</time> by <a rel="author">Larry Celona and Sara Dorn</a></address>
      <p>The state parole board is releasing a woman convicted in the line-of-duty assassination of an NYPD officer — but failed to tell the cop’s family in advance of the decision, the hero’s heartbroken widow told The Post.</p>
      <p>Margaret Mosomillo said she had always been given a heads-up in the past when Betsy Ramos was being considered for release, and each time spoke out in opposition to it.</p>
      <p>But Mosomillo, whose husband, Anthony, was <a href="https://nypost.com/1999/03/02/so-where-are-the-tears-for-this-brave-hero">fatally shot in Brooklyn in 1998</a>, said she never received similar notice this time.</p>
      <p>Neither did the Police Benevolent Association nor Anthony Mosomillo’s brother, Salvatore.</p>
      <p>“This is a disgrace,” Salvatore raged. “How could they let out a cop-killer? Basically back-dooring the family. Imagine what they could do to an average [civilian] victim’s family.”</p>
      <p>Salvatore, who has also spoken on his brother’s behalf before the board, said the family’s pain is still raw.</p>
      <p>“It was 21 years ago, but to me it’s like it just happened yesterday. They’re talking about giving her a second chance. Where is my brother’s second chance?” My family is still suffering 21 years later. That’s not going to stop,” he said.</p>
      <p>Added the widow, “I feel victimized all over again.”</p>
      <p>Ramos was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in Anthony Mosomillo’s death in an East Flatbush apartment.</p>
      <p>She was convicted of helping wrest the gun from the holster of Mosomillo’s partner during a deadly scuffle.</p>
      <p>The cops had been there to arrest Ramos’ boyfriend, paroled drug dealer Jose Serrano, for failing to show up on drug charges.</p>
      <p>But Serrano opened fire — and moments later the mortally-injured Mosomillo, 36, shot him dead as a final act of police duty.</p>
      <p>Ramos won her freedom Oct. 29, but Margaret Mosomillo said she only learned the news earlier this month. She immediately called the Office of Victims’ Assistance, asking, “Am I reading this right?”</p>
      <p>To her horror, she was.</p>
      <p>Parole officials say they notified Margaret by letter Sept. 20, along with the PBA attorney and Salvatore Mosomillo, now a retired NYPD officer.</p>
      <p>The Mosomillos don’t buy it.</p>
      <p>“It was three different addresses. Three different boroughs. No one got it,” Margaret said.</p>
      <p>“We got all the other letters,” Salvatore said. “Why didn’t we get this one?”</p>
      <p>Ramos could be sprung as early as Dec. 10, but a law-enforcement source said she will be immediately taken into custody on an outstanding federal warrant.</p>
      <p>“The con game that the Parole Board just ran on the Mosomillo family is an utter disgrace,” said the union’s president, Pat Lynch.</p>
      <p>“They are rolling out the red carpet for cop-killers and other vicious criminals at every turn, while our families live in fear of being victimized a second time.”</p>
      <p>Anthony Mosomillo left behind a then-2-year-old daughter, Francesca, now set to graduate from the Police Academy in December. He also left behind an older daughter, Marie, from a previous relationship.</p>
      <p>“My husband, Anthony, loved life. He loved his family. He loved doing things with his daughter . . . He loved being a cop,” his wife said.</p>
