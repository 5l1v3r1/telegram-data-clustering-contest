      <p>Onyema was accused of moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.</p>
      <p>Allen Onyema however says the allegations against him are false, adding that all transactions were carried out through the Central Bank of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The Air Peace CEO says his only aim has been to build Nigeria and improve the well-being of Nigerians.</p>
      <p>He said,</p>
      <blockquote>“As the press statement clearly stated, these are indictment that only contains charges. I am innocent of all charges and the US government will find no dirt on me because I have never conducted business with any illegalities.<br/><br/>“Be rest assured that I also have my lawyers on this and these mere allegations will be refuted. I never laundered money in my life, neither have I committed bank fraud anywhere in the world. Every Kobo I transferred to the US for aircraft purchase went through the Central Bank of Nigeria LC regime and all were used for the same purpose.<br/><br/>“The American companies that received the funds are still in business. I never took a penny from any US bank or Nigerian bank. I am willing to defend my innocence in the US courts,” he announced.</blockquote>
