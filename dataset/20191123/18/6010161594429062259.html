      <h1>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Apex Legends did the business in October – SuperData</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:05:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>The best-selling digital launch of 2019 is Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, according to estimates from SuperData.</p>
      <p>Considering <b>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</b> released at the end of the October reporting period, that’s a rather large feat.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/worldwide-digital-games-market/">According to SuperData figures</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.bluesnews.com/s/205885/october-digital-sales-charts">Blue</a>), the game sold an estimated 4.75 million digital units across console and PC. While that figure is down 11% from Black Ops 4 in 2018, the latter released on October 6, compared to Modern Warfare’s October 26 release.</p>
      <p>The game came in first place on the digital console charts and sixth on PC.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/12/call-duty-mobile-hit-148-million-downloads-first-month-besting-fornite-pugb-debuts/">And the juggernaut</a> that is <b>Call of Duty Mobile</b> generated an estimated $57 million in total revenue during its October launch. During the month, the game saw 116 million monthly active users, with iOS making up 82% of total spend.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the report, SuperData also states <b>Apex Legends</b> had its best month since the title’s release. The game generated $45 million from in-game spending in October across all platforms – up from $16 million in September.</p>
      <p>Looking over the digital chart for the month, <b>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</b> – which released on October 6 – came in fourth place on the console chart. October 25 release <b>The Outer Worlds</b> saw a nice debut landing at number nine on the digital PC chart.</p>
      <p>Mainstays <b>Fortnite</b> and <b>GTA 5</b> were both in the top 10 in digital sales on consoles for the month alongside second-placed <b>Destiny 2</b>.</p>
      <p>Destiny 2’s placement on the chart is likely attributed to the release of Shadowkeep and New Light which released on October 1.</p>
