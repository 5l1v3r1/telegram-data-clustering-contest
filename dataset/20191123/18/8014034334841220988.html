      <p>BOGOTA — Authorities in Colombia are maintaining a heightened police and military presence in the nation’s capital following two days of unrest.</p>
      <p>Gen. Luis Navarro said at a news conference Saturday that 7,000 officers remain dispersed around Bogota to “guarantee security.”</p>
      <p>President Iván Duque ordered a seldom-used curfew in Bogota Friday evening as the nation grapples with the aftermath of a mass protest.</p>
      <p>An estimated 250,000 Colombians took the streets around the nation Thursday in a protest that started off peacefully but ended in scattered clashes.</p>
      <p>Duque has promised to begin a “national conversation” aimed at including students, labour unions and other groups in drafting reforms.</p>
      <p>Over 330 people were caught violating Friday’s curfew and about 170 detained.</p>
