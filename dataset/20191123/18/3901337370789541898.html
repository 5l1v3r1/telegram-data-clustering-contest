      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has been vocal about the referees, but he felt the decision to send Gaston Sirino was the right one by Victor Gomes.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/mamelodi-sundowns/telkom-knockout-semi-final-report-golden-arrows-v-mamelodi-sundowns-23-november-2019/668039">Mixed Day For Sirino As Downs Secure TKO Final Spot</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Sirino had an eventful afternoon as he bagged Sundowns' second goal and was later shown a straight red card in the 2-1 win over Golden Arrows in the Telkom Knockout semi-final.</p>
      <p>While Mosimane did take issues with a couple of the linesman's calls, he felt Sirino deserved to be sent off for his late challenge on Matome Mathiane.</p>
      <p>"We have the experience of playing ten against eleven, last year I think we got three red cards from Gaston Sirino and we still managed to deal with it, because you don't have to change the tactics, all you have to do is to reduce one striker upfront, that's all and everything remains the same.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy if I'm wrong, if the goal they scored with a flick was not offside. I want to be wrong, I'm happy to be wrong but the linesman missed two offside decisions from where I was and if I'm wrong, I'm happy to be wrong and if I'm right I can be right.</p>
      <p>"Ja, [Gaston] Sirino was naughty, [Victor] Gomes [referee] was right to take him out."</p>
