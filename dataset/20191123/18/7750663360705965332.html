      <p>It had looked like the hosts would end their run of four straight defeats but they were eventually undone by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/patrick-bamford/"><b>Patrick Bamford</b></a>'s close-range finish, which was credited to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matt-pearson/"><b>Matt Pearson</b></a> as an own goal.</p>
      <p>Although Leeds dominated the early stages in terms of possession, it was Luton who had the first effort after 20 minutes, Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu firing over the bar from just outside the box.</p>
      <p>Midway through the half Bamford went closest for Leeds, as a quick visiting break saw his left-footed effort force <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-shea/"><b>James Shea</b></a> into an awkward save.</p>
      <p>The Hatters created another opportunity from a clever corner routine, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/izzy-brown/"><b>Izzy Brown</b></a> finding captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sonny-bradley/"><b>Sonny Bradley</b></a>, whose volley flew narrowly wide of the target.</p>
      <p>Leeds then began to take a real stranglehold on proceedings, with Bamford's close-range attempt hitting the upright, before Shea made a superb double save to keep out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kalvin-phillips/"><b>Kalvin Phillips</b></a>' 20-yard strike and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-harrison/"><b>Jack Harrison</b></a>'s follow-up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mateusz-klich/"><b>Mateusz Klich</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luke-ayling/"><b>Luke Ayling</b></a> both had efforts fly wide while, with 40 minutes gone, Bamford's header was too close to Shea, before the home keeper made an excellent save from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tyler-roberts/"><b>Tyler Roberts</b></a>' deflected effort.</p>
      <p>Moments before half-time Brown curled over for Luton but, in the second period, United had the lead after 50 minutes with a goal of real controversy.</p>
      <p>Brown appeared to be clipped when on the ball for Town, only for referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-brooks/"><b>John Brooks</b></a> to give nothing. Leeds counter-attacked with clinical precision and Bamford rifled past Shea at his near post.</p>
      <p>However, buoyed by the injustice, the Hatters were level after 54 minutes, as Brown sent over a terrific cross for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-collins/"><b>James Collins</b></a> to nod past <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kiko-casilla/"><b>Kiko Casilla</b></a> for his sixth of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-cornick/"><b>Harry Cornick</b></a>'s effort was saved by the keeper, before Luton thought they had the lead but Matty Pearson's goal was ruled out by a late linesman's flag.</p>
      <p>Bradley whizzed one over from the edge of the box yet Bamford should have made it 2-1 on 64 minutes, volleying waywardly from just eight yards out.</p>
      <p>Luton tried for a winner, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andrew-shinnie/"><b>Andrew Shinnie</b></a>'s low drive gathered by Casilla, but United kept on pushing in the closing stages, bringing on Tottenham's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-clarke/"><b>Jack Clarke</b></a> for his first league appearance of the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pablo-hernandez/"><b>Pablo Hernandez</b></a> tried to beat Shea from 18 yards, the Town stopper equal to his attempt once more, before he could watch <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stuart-dallas/"><b>Stuart Dallas</b></a>' ambitious long-distance strike fly over the bar.</p>
      <p>Shea denied Klich twice in the closing stages, as it looked like he would be the hero until Bamford pounced, with the help of Pearson.</p>
      <p>Town should have left with a point though, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dan-potts/"><b>Dan Potts</b></a> heading a gilt-edged chance wide with the last kick as Luton slumped to another loss.</p>
