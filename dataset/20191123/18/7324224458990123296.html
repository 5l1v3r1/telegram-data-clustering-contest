      <p>After an even and cagey opening, the visitors had slightly the better of the first period as Liam Agnew fired over the bar from 20 yards for the Heed in the 21st minute and Rob Evans made a brilliant 25th minute challenge to rob</p>
      <p>Michael Nelson in the home penalty area. Home goalkeeper Brendon Bunn saved easily as Greg Olley met Jordan Preston's 26th minute corner and Bunn made low save from Preston a minute later. As Halesowen began to test the visitors, Jamie Molyneux's 34th minute ball across goal was cleared.</p>
      <p>But it was Halesowen who really took the game to their higher league visitors after the interval to record a famous victory. Montel Gibson earned Halesowen's first corner in the 50th minute, but Ash Sammons delivered straight at goalkeeper Sam Guthrie. Sammons then hit over the bar as Halesowen earned another 56th minute corner kick. At the other end, James Bowen did well to head clear a 58th minute free-kick from Gateshead captain Scott Barrows.</p>
      <p>As Halesowen's belief grew, Guthrie did well to tip a low, dipping 20 yard shot from Sammons around the post for another home corner in the 64th minute. Bowen surged down the left four minutes later but crossed over the bar and Molyneux shot at Guthrie after 69 minutes. Sammons was a constant danger and he struck another low, raking drive after 73 minutes with the ball deflected away for a corner.</p>
      <p>Gateshead introduced leading striker Joshua Kayode late on and the Yeltz had an 80th minute let-off when Kayode robbed home goalkeeper Bunn but could only strike the side-netting with Bunn stranded well out of his goal. Bunn then made a good save at Kayode's feet after captain Paul McCone lost out four minutes later.</p>
      <p>But the Yeltz grabbed their 86th minute winner when a right-wing corner was headed back by Gibson at the far post for Cobourne to stab home from close range and send the Grove into raptures.</p>
