      <h1>Strictly leaderboard: Week 10 results after controversial Michelle Visage axing</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing is back this evening with everything to dance for, and we'll be bringing you the judges scores as they're announced</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:55:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Blackpool has come and gone, with the remaining six couples heading back to the dancefloor for tonight's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a>.</p>
      <p>Gracing us with a stellar vocal performance, Bruno Tonioli opened Week 10 with customary verve and flair.</p>
      <p>Last week left fans in shock after fan favourite - and expected finalist - Michelle Visage was given the boot after landing at the bottom of the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>It's a sign of how tight the competition now is that an impressive 32 could land Michelle and her pro partner Giovanni Pernice at the bottom, with the pair losing out in Sunday's dance off to Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard.</p>
      <p>It came as no surprise, though, to see Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse and Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden joined at the top of the leaderboard, both boasting a near perfect 39.</p>
      <p>Trailing behind were Emma Barton and Anton du Beke with 37 - Anton's first ever 10s- followed by Saffron and AJ with 35.</p>
      <p>Alex Scott and Neil Jones earned 34, and Chris Ramsey and Karen Hauer had just one point on Michelle and Giovanni with 33.</p>
      <p>We'll be bringing you the judges scores as they happen tonight...</p>

      <h3>Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard</h3>
      <p>Saffron and AJ danced a Samba to Walking on Sunshine by Take Me To Rio Collective.</p>
      <p>Craig -  5</p>
      <p>Motsi -  7</p>
      <p>Shirley -  7</p>
      <p>Bruno -  7</p>
      <p>Total: 26</p>
      <p>Saffron got a visit from her social media fans while in training!</p>

      <h3>Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden</h3>
      <p>Karim and Amy danced their Couple's Choice of Contemporary to Drops of Jupiter by With Confidence.</p>
      <p>Craig -  9</p>
      <p>Motsi -  9</p>
      <p>Shirley - 10</p>
      <p>Bruno -  10</p>
      <p>Total: 38</p>
      <p>No doubt Karim would have won a fair few votes by that sweet moment with his mum at the end.</p>
      <p>Craig seemed emotional as he claimed he desperately wanted to give Karim a 10.</p>
