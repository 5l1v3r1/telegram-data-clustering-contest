      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - The British Conservative Party’s lead over the opposition Labour Party has grown to its widest since 2017 with less than three weeks to go before the Dec. 12 election, a poll by Opinium for the Observer newspaper showed on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservatives now stands at 47%, up three points from last week, while Labour remained at 28%. The pro-European Liberal Democrats fell two points to 12%, while the Brexit Party fell to 3%.</p>
      <p>“The Brexit Party standing down in all Tory (Conservative)-held seats has given the Conservatives an even larger vote share and increased their lead over the Labour Party,” said Jack Tadman, research manager at Opinium.</p>
      <p>He added that there were still a large number of undecided voters who could narrow the Conservatives’ lead.</p>
      <p>The online poll of 2,003 people was conducted between Nov. 20 and Nov. 22, straddling the launch of Labour’s policy manifesto. The Conservatives are due to launch theirs on Sunday.</p>
