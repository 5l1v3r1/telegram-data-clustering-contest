      <p>League leaders <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/liverpool">Liverpool</a> visited Selhurst Park this evening to face Crystal Palace in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/epl">Premier League</a>. It's a venue not particularly liked by the visitors due to their history at the ground and the leaders were hoping to continue their unbeaten run.</p>
      <p>It was a tough game for the Reds, as the home team gave it their all but just fell short till the final few minutes. The first half saw an unmotivated display by Liverpool, who were looking disjointed post the international break, and not at all like their usual selves. Crystal Palace played with their hearts out against England's most dominant team and threatened the Liverpool defence on several occasions.</p>
      <p>It was Sadio Mane who scored the opener for the visitors just after the start of the second half. The Eagles did not bow out and continued to attack. They were rewarded for their efforts in the 82nd minute when some poor defending saw Wilfried Zaha find some open space in the box, and he finished past Alisson Becker. However, as has been the case so often this season, Liverpool found the winner through Roberto Firmino who found the back of the net in the 85th minute.</p>
      <p>This 1-2 win ensured that the Reds remain 8 points clear at the top of the table with 13 games done. Here are the three reasons why they won the game -</p>
      <h3>#1. VAR came to Liverpool's rescue yet again</h3>

      <p>Liverpool looked a shadow of themselves in the first half as Crystal Palace were the more threatening team for the first 45 minutes. James Tomkins nodded the ball in from a corner in the 42nd minute, and the home fans went ballistic. However, there seemed to be some controversy regarding the goal and VAR was called in to intervene.</p>
      <p>Upon inspection, VAR adjudged that Palace striker Ayew had pushed Dejan Lovren in the box, and it was deemed to be a foul. As a result, the goal was overruled and the score remained 0-0. Although not a very strong challenge, the push was intended to unsettle Lovren and VAR made the correct decision in this regard, as the Reds heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
      <p>It was a point of sorrow for the home team, who thought they deserved a goal for all the good work they had put in. It was not to be, however, and Liverpool went on to win the game eventually. VAR has helped the league leaders on several occasions this season, and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/jurgen-klopp">Jurgen Klopp</a> will be thankful for the system at the moment.</p>
