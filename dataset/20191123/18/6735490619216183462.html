      <p>“Without getting too deep… I think just honesty. I mean the lyrics, naturally, my style, are quite autobiographical anyway,” Tomlinson recently told Billboard’s “Pop Shop” podcast while talking about his new album.</p>
      <p>He added, “I’m always trying to humanize myself as much as possible and make myself relatable to fans, and I think with honesty, you can do that, you know what I mean?”</p>
