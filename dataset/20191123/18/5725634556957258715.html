      <p>Three companies entered the public market, including the first two semiconductor IPOs in two years, and all priced at the low end in another week marked by mark-downs. They were joined by five SPACs, the most SPACs in a week, ever. Chinese debt collector YX Asset Recovery (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YXR">YXR</a>) postponed then withdrew its $81 million US IPO, the first of the 4Q19's China wave to do so. Two Chinese issuers and one SPAC submitted initial filings.</p>
      <p>MegaChips spin-off SiTime (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SITM">SITM</a>), a fabless producer of silicon timing systems, raised $56 million at a $186 million market cap. Despite lumpy growth, SiTime was able to pique investor interest with its large share of the nascent silicon-based oscillator market, used in connected devices. After popping 44% in its debut, the company traded off slightly, finishing up 39%.</p>
      <p>In the first <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/66082/Don%E2%80%99t-call-it-a-comeback-Crypto-focused-IPOs-are-on-the-rise-as-Bitcoin-pri">pure-play public equity targeting Bitcoin</a>, Canaan (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAN">CAN</a>) raised $90 million at a $1.4 billion market value. It's the world's second largest producer of Bitcoin mining equipment with a 23% share, but its heavy exposure to Bitcoin and consequently volatile revenue and margins left investors wary. After dropping as much as 17% intraday on Friday, Canaan finished flat.</p>
      <p>Retail and office REIT Alpine Income Property Trust (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PINE">PINE</a>) raised $143 million at a $173 million market cap. Carved out of Consolidated-Tomoka (NYSE: <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTO">CTO</a>), Alpine Income offered a 4.2% yield, but the small and concentrated REIT garnered little interest from investors, finishing flat.</p>
      <p>Targeting the healthcare industry, Concord Health Partners' CHP Merger Corp. (CHPMU) raised $250 million and Avego and Metalmark Capital's Amplitude Healthcare Acquisition (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMHCU">AMHCU</a>) raised $100 million. Hennessy Capital's real estate tech SPAC PropTech Acquisition (PTACU) raised $150 million, and former Ooyala officers' software SPAC Software Acquisition Group (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAQNU">SAQNU</a>) raised $130 million. Led by a team from Shanghai, GreenVision Acquisition (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRNV">GRNV</a>) raised $50 million to acquire a healthcare business outside of China.</p>
