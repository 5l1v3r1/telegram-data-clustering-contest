      <h1>Meet 'Sexy Samaritan' student nurse who makes £2,500 a night stripping</h1>
      <h2>The undergraduate, who earns £2,500 a night, calls herself a 'Sexy Samaritan'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:40:18+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A student nurse has spoken out over how she found love stripping.</p>
      <p>The undergraduate, who earns £2,500 a night,  calls herself a 'Sexy Samaritan'.</p>
      <p>Ellen started pole dancing for some extra cash and found a new passion in life.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has a stripper alter ego called 'bunny' and says most men she spends time with just want a chat.</p>
      <p>She also met the love of her life, Si, while pole dancing at a strip club and is now a happily married stepmother-of-two.</p>
      <p>Ellen started her pole dancing career in Brighton when she moved there to start nurse training, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/student-nurse-earns-2500-night-20934471">reports Mirror Online.</a></p>

      <p>She was encouraged by her mum to look into stripping after she heard on the radio how medical students were stripping for extra cash.</p>
      <p>And Ellen says she gets treated better at the strip club than when she’s working in a hospital.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Documentary Girls on Girls she said: "I did want to help people. I’m from a family of nurses, but the reality is, it’s really hard and it is tiring.</p>
      <p>“It was also a new situation [moving to Brighton], I didn’t know anyone. I had no family here, no friends – I was really on my own.</p>
      <p>"It was only through dancing I have met all my friends which has really changed my life.”</p>
      <p>Ellen pays a house fee to perform at a strip club where the women take it in turns to dance on a pole.</p>
      <p>They perform to two songs; one in their underwear and one topless. However they are only paid for private lap dances.</p>
      <p>Ellen said: "When we’re not on the stage, we’ll be walking around the floor, talking to customers and trying to get them into private lap dances, where we get fully naked.</p>
      <p>“And that’s how we make our money. More often than not, I’m getting paid £400, £500 to sit with someone and just chat to them. We are like expensive counsellors, it’s brilliant.”</p>
      <p>Ellen, who admits she ‘gets a lot of stick’, said “People think that we are s****, we’ve got STIs and we sleep with people’s husbands and this is a last resort, but that is not the case at all.</p>
      <p>“We are doing this because we want money like any other job.”</p>
      <p>She also doesn’t mind baring her body to strangers as “at the end of the night, I’m going home to my husband."</p>
      <p>She continued: “People may not see me as a feminist because I’m a stripper, but we are just trying to better our lives. We are not s***s, we are not doing anything wrong.”</p>
      <p>Ellen will only stop dancing when she’s ready and no one will influence her decision - not even husband Si.</p>
      <p>He said: "I trust her 100 per cent, I met her doing it so I couldn’t really turn around and judge her or tell her to stop doing it.”</p>
      <p>For now, Ellen “absolutely loves it" and the confidence it gives her.</p>
      <p>She said: "And I’m going to be able to save, whereas if I was just a nurse I would not be able to do that."</p>
