      <p>If you are a Burtonian you will no doubt be hugely proud of your town.</p>
      <p>For Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, which has a population of 80,000, which sits next to the River Trent is most famous for being the brewing capital of the world.</p>
      <p>It is home to many a top firm too with the likes of Holland and Barrett, Waterstones and Clippers to name but a few.</p>
      <p>It also has a football club in Burton Albion FC that punches above its weight given their exploits in the Championship for two seasons and reaching the semi-final of the league cup.</p>
      <p>But Burtonians might be surprised to learn they are not alone as there are one or two other Burtons across the pond in America.</p>
      <p>We've compiled a list of what we believe to be every place named Burton in the USA to see how they compare to our town â€“ and some of them may surprise you.</p>
      <p>Some cities which share our name may be bigger, but can they beat our beer?</p>
      <p>So here are a few of the other Burtons in the world:</p>

      <h3>Places named Burton from around the world</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Burton, Michigan</h4>

          <p>Burton is the second largest city in Genessee County in the state of Michigan, with a population of 29,999 - a lot less than half of our Burton population.</p>
          <p>And just like our very own Burton, Burton, in Michigan is close to a place called Foremark.</p>
          <p>The City of Burton was originally organised as Burton Township, named after John Burton, a prominent local farmer. Burton Township had first been a part of Grand Blanc Township in 1835 then Flint Township in 1836.</p>
          <p>Just like East Midlands Airport, Burton Michigan boasts the Athelone Memorial Airport under 30 minutes away.</p>

          <p>Burton was created in 1836. A post office called Burton was established in 1840, and remained in operation until 1922.</p>
          <p>The township of Burton and Adams County contains five cemeteries: Burton, Independence, Kimmons, Newton and Tandy. This can be compared to our local Stapenhill Cemetery.</p>

          <p>Burton Township is the smallest in area in McHenry County, Illinois. As of the 2010 census, its population was 5,003 and it contained 1,758 housing units.</p>
          <p>The English first settled in Burton Township in 1836, and the name English Prairie was given it. Later settlers called the township Benton, but after learning that there was already a post office and township of Benton in Illinois, the name was changed to Burton on December 28, 1850</p>
          <p>It boasts Richardson Adventure Farm with the world's largest corn maze - a little bit like our National Forest Adventure Farm.</p>

          <p>It boasts the Burton Lake - a little bit smaller than our beloved River Trent.</p>

          <p>A post office called Burton was established in 1873, and remained in operation until 1935. The community has the name of Prior Burton, the original owner of the site.</p>
          <p>Running through Burton is the Salt Fork stream - not as impressive at the River Trent though. It is also closed to the town of Ivanhoe - a name connected closely to our neighbouring town of Ashby.</p>

          <p>One of the more similar towns to us, this Burton even has the Burton Wetlands and the Burton Wetlands Nature Reserve which can be compared to our Washlands. Its river is the East Branch Cuyahoga River.</p>

          <p>Port Royal Island, historically Port Royal, is an island located in Beaufort County, South Carolina. It is considered one of Sea Islands in the Lowcounty region.</p>
          <p>Burton's heyday was during the truck farming era in Beaufort County from 1900 to 1930. The 'centre' of Burton was where Broad River Boulevard crosses the abandoned Port Royal Railroad tracks and Route 21.</p>
          <p>Again, close to a water source of Salt Creek, Burton does boast some similarities to us and you may recognise some of its businesses such as Domino's, KFC and Enterprise Cars.</p>

          <h4>Burton, Georgia: The town that lies underwater</h4>

          </figure>
          <p>Did you know that there was a Burton in America that is now covered by a lake? Burton, Georgia, was once a mighty town famous for "gold-rushing", where many would flock to the town to hunt for the precious metal.</p>
          <p>A railway company went on to buy the whole town and decided to close the dam. Before long, the town of Burton became submerged underwater, and is now called Lake Burton.</p>
          <p>Back here in Burton-on-Trent, The Washlands might be known for flooding as the Trent bursts its banks now and then - but so far our town has never ended up underwater - not even in the big flood of 2000!</p>
