      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157052164917983&amp;set=a.46153017982&amp;type=3">In a post on Facebook</a> that has been shared hundreds of thousands of times, she said: "Saturday night I got home late and my dog didn't recognise me. Being a nanny, I thought I woke him up and he was having a night terror.</p>
      <p>"Sunday he was still acting weird.</p>
      <p>"I realised that I had been running my new diffuser and decided to turn it off. Sunday afternoon he was feeling better."</p>

      <p>However the next day, the dog sitter informed Marianne the dog had refused to come out from under the bed.</p>
      <p>When she returned home from work, her beloved pet once again seemed to not recognise her.</p>
      <p>She continued: "I took him to the emergency vet. It turns out that the tea tree oil I was using in the diffuser is toxic for dogs.</p>
      <p>"Thankfully the test showed that his liver was ok, but we weren't out of the woods yet. He was given fluids under his skin to get the toxins out.</p>
      <p>"The vet and the poison control are saying that they see these cases often now that the popularity of essential oil is growing.</p>
