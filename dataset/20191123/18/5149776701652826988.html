      <h1>'It's got to change' - Neal Ardley concerned as Notts County are beaten at Aldershot</h1>
      <h2>Magpies suffered back to back defeats for first time this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:26:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:26</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley delivered a withering assessment of Notts County's defeat at Aldershot as the anniversary of his first year in charge at Meadow Lane was one to forget.</p>
      <p>On the date he was appointed as Harry Kewell's successor last year, the Magpies failed to give him the celebration he was looking for as they were beaten 2-1 at the EBB Stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> were the masters of their own downfall as they gifted possession away in midfield which led to a counter attack that ended with Mohamed Bettamer crashing a header beyond Sam Slocombe.</p>
      <p>Kyle Wootton's seventh goal of the season put Notts back on level terms, but a poor pass from Ben Turner into the feet of Michael Doyle saw him lose possession to Alfy Whittingham who slipped the ball beyond Slocombe.</p>
      <p>Notts could not haul themselves level for a second time and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> was disappointed with his side's desire.</p>
      <p>"The mistakes are costing us but that’s not the bit that really gets to me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The rest of the game wasn’t intense enough and it’s got to change.</p>
      <p>“The one thing that bothers me more than anything is it looked like the opposition wanted it more – and that was the case last week, too.</p>
      <p>“Our levels have dropped. We’ve not had the spice and intensity we had earlier in the season, we haven’t won 50/50s and we’ve not done the nitty-gritty well enough in the last few matches.”</p>
      <p>With Notts having grown a reputation as being one of the best teams in the league, Ardley feels that Notts have become the side everybody wants to beat.</p>

      <p>And he says his side need to get used to dealing with the pressure of being a scalp.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the season, we tried to recruit players we thought could handle the pressure of playing for Notts County,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“People raise their game against us and if we let our levels drop like we have done the last two weeks, we get what we deserve – nothing.</p>
      <p>“We have to expect teams to be aggressive against us and need to stand up, win our 50/50s and do the nitty-gritty stuff properly.</p>
      <p>“Maybe teams are working us out but there are solutions to everything,” Ardley added.</p>
      <p>“For 90 per cent of the season, the players have got it right and we’ll work to solve the problems.</p>
      <p>“There’s a challenge on our hands. We’re a good team that is capable of getting in the play-offs but not unless we bring the side of the game that earns results when you don’t play well.”</p>
