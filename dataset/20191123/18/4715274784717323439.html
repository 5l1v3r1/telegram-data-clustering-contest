      <h1>Yes, dogs can eat some berries</h1>

      <p>Berries are very rich in nutrients which dogs can benefit from.  </p>
      <p>There are some berries which can be given to dogs.</p>
      <p>It is best given as is (crushed or cut in bite sizes depending on the size of the dog) or mixed with Yakult which is good for digestion.</p>
      <p>Naturipefarms.com, in “3 Types of berries dogs can eat!,” identified these berries as strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Please remove the leaves and the hard parts where the stem used to be attached before giving to your dog. </p>
      <p>Here is our suggested amount:</p>
      <p>1.     For small dogs – one strawberry or 3 blueberries per serving, maximum of three times a week</p>
      <p>2.     For medium-sized dogs – two strawberries or 5 blueberries per serving, maximum of three times a week</p>
      <p>3.     For large dogs – three-five strawberries or 7-10 blueberries  per serving, maximum of three times a week</p>
      <p>We have not found blackberries in the Philippines. Strawberries and blueberries can be bought in groceries. Strawberries can also be  found in the tiangge (flea market) or  vegetable stalls in front of the NHA building, Quezon Memorial Circle, Quezon City (weekends), in Sidcor Market, Centris (Sundays, 6 a.m. to 12 noon), or the flea market in Legaspi Village, Makati (Sundays, morning).</p>
      <p>“Pooch, Pup or Tail-wagger; some of the many names used for Man’s best friend. These loyal animals have been by man’s side for over 20,000 years. Over time, dogs have evolved into many shapes and sizes but will always hold a place in the heart of many families. Dogs are important members of a family, and their health is taken seriously so that can live a happy and healthy life.  A dog’s diet is restricted to nutrient rich kibble to maintain health..,” Naturipefarms.com said.</p>

        <b>Blueberries</b>
      </p>
      <p>These berries are lumped with other superfood because of its health benefits for humans.</p>
      <p>“You already know that blueberries are good for us. They’re one of those ‘superfoods’ we’re constantly told we should have more of in our diets,” Naturipefarms.com said.</p>
      <p>It is no surprise to know then that blueberries are also good for dogs, Naturipefarms.com said.</p>
      <p>Blueberries contain all the antioxidants, fiber and phytochemicals that will make your dogs as healthy as humans who have them in their diet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Strawberries</b>
      </p>
      <p>Strawberries contain a lot of vitamins and provide the same benefits that blueberries give.</p>
      <p>“Along with blueberries, strawberries are a nutritional powerhouse for both you and your dog. Like their blue cousins, strawberries are full of antioxidants. They also boast high fiber and a lot of vitamin C,” Naturipefarms.com said.</p>
      <p>“Here’s a bonus: Strawberries even contain an enzyme that can help whiten your dog’s teeth,” Naturipefarms.com said.</p>
      <p>“Keep a bag of frozen strawberries in your freezer to make smoothies for yourself, and you’ll also have a crunchy snack on hand for man’s best friend. Just don’t feed unlimited amounts, because even though the sugar in strawberries is natural sugar, too much can be bad news, Naturipefarms.com said.</p>
      <p>Do not give frozen berries during the cold months as your dog might develop cough and colds. It is best given in the summer months.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blackberries</b>
      </p>
      <p>These berries are as healthy as the blue and red ones.</p>
      <p>“Blackberries round out the holy trinity of healthy berries for your trusty mutt, along with strawberries and blueberries. Like those others, blackberries are loaded with antioxidants to fight free radicals in your dog, and also have plenty of fiber and vitamins, too,” Naturipefarms.com said.</p>

      <p>“These (berries) contain pits and/or chemicals that can be health hazards for your dog,” Naturipefarms.com said.</p>
