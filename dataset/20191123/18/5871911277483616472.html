      <h1>Zach LaVine unhappy about being pulled from game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:38:33+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tsd-staff/" target="_blank">TSD Staff</a></address>
      <p>No one can question Zach LaVine’s contributions on the offensive end of the floor during games, but his defensive efforts sometimes can be inadequate for the style of play the Bulls run.</p>
      <p>That was apparently the case in Friday’s game against the Heat, so Bulls head coach Jim Boylen pulled him during the first quarter of the game. Boylen said he identified what he believed to be multiple <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/bulls-guard-zach-la-vine-bristles-at-being-benched-singled-out-054956925.html">defensive mistakes</a>, so LaVine had to spend some early on time on the bench as a result.</p>
      <p>And LaVine really wasn’t happy about it.</p>
