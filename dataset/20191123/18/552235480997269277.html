      <p>Broxburn Athletic’s remarkable Scottish Cup campaign continues after they booked their place in the fourth round.</p>
      <p>Zander Miller netted the only goal of the game in the 84 th minute as they got the better of Highland League outfit Inverurie Loco Works.</p>
      <p>Cheered on by an impressive and vocal away following, Brian McNaughton’s men are last remaining East of Scotland side left in the competition and will be in tomorrow’s draw alongside the likes of Celtic, Rangers and the rest of the top flight clubs.</p>
      <p>Loco Works became the third side from a higher division that Broxburn have beaten in the Cup having already disposed of East Stirlingshire and Cowdenbeath prior to today’s victory.</p>
      <p>The fourth round draw will be made tomorrow evening on the BBC during Sportscene, which starts at 7.15pm.</p>
