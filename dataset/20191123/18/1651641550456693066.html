      <h1>Microsoft confirms the Windows 10 November 2019 update is not the new normal</h1>

      <p>Earlier this week, Microsoft released its second and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-1909november-2019-update-is-now-available-via-windows-10-update-assistant/">last</a> major Windows 10 update of 2019 to all Windows 10 users.  The <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-november-2019-update-now-available-for-download/">Windows 10 November 2019 Update</a> included performance improvements, enterprise features and quality improvements.</p>
      <p>At first glance, the mere 180KB that the update required appeared erroneous; but Microsoft explained that it’s the nature of the Enablement Package which makes it so small.  The minor update is essentially an “on switch”, which activates modified files from the May 2019 update.  Users are, therefore, required to install all previous cumulative updates.</p>
      <blockquote>“Before a device can be offered 19H2 by Windows Update, all “recommended” updates like monthly cumulative updates or Adobe Flash security updates must be installed. We are planning to improve this behavior in the coming months so other updates don’t have to be installed first.”- Microsoft</blockquote>
      <p>Inconveniences aside, the update didn’t really live up to expectations. While users were anticipating major improvements, many were disappointed when they discovered that it only delivers minor fixes.</p>
      <p>Microsoft has acknowledged the negative feedback that the pilot project has received from Insider users, and has since indicated that it will not be making another appearance; thereby suggesting that the company will, in future, revert to the old model of two major annual updates.</p>
      <blockquote>“There isn’t a formal plan in place to deliver future releases in the same way”- Microsoft.</blockquote>
      <p>Reports also state that the layout of the Windows 10 November 2019 update is an exception because Microsoft is adjusting the service schedule of its major updates to fit a new schedule.  In December, Windows 10 20H1 RTM candidate will be signed off, and users can expect an even earlier update.</p>
      <p>To <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-november-2019-update-now-available-for-download/">download</a> the Windows 10 November 2019 update, check for updates under Windows Update Settings.</p>
