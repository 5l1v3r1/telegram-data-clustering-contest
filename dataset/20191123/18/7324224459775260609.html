      <p>Bottom club Chorley made it back-to-back Vanarama National League victories with a 1-0 win over Torquay.</p>
      <p>The Magpies scored the only goal of the game in the 24th minute when Matt Challoner intercepted a pass and played the ball to Mark Ross, whose cross was headed past the goalkeeper by Marcus Carver.</p>
      <p>The hosts were given the chance to double their advantage from the penalty spot whenÂ Charles Vernam was brought down after 52 minutes.</p>
      <p>Vernam stepped up to take the spot-kick but Gulls goalkeeper Shaun MacDonald saved.</p>
      <p>Torquay dominated possession as time ticked away at Victory Park, but they were unable to find an equaliser that would have prevented a second successive defeat.</p>
