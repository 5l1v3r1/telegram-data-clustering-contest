      <p>Teenage tennis sensation Cori 'Coco' Gauff is heading to Auckland for the 2020 ASB Classic.</p>
      <p>The 15-year-old captured sporting headlines at Wimbledon in June, when she became the youngest player to ever qualify for the main draw, and beat idol and five-time champion Venus Williams in the first round. </p>
      <p>Gauff continued her run through to the second week, before she was eliminated in the fourth round. The world No.68 finished the season in fine form, with a third-round run at the US Open, followed by a first WTA title at the Generali Linz Ladies Open in Austria - becoming the youngest tour winner since 2004. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Tournament director Karl Budge has lauded the recruitment of such an exciting prospect. </p>
      <p>"Coco is probably the most-in-demand player on tour at the moment," Budge said.  </p>
      <p>"She was the front page of almost every global publication after her Wimbledon triumphs and set the sport alight.  </p>
      <p>"We have had some superstars come through Auckland early in their careers, however Coco may well be the best of them all."</p>
      <p>Gauff joins a stellar cast that includes former world No.1 Serena Williams, 2019 finalist and world No.5 Bianca Andreescu and defending champion Julia Georges.</p>
      <p>The American is looking forward to her first visit to one of the most popular tournaments of the year. </p>
      <p>"I can’t wait to start my season in Auckland," Gauff said. "2019 was such an incredible year and I achieved so many of the goals that I had set for myself. </p>
      <p>"Wimbledon was obviously a highlight, as was capturing my first WTA title. However I have a number of goals and things that I am working on in my game, and I can’t wait to start my 2020 year at the ASB Classic.</p>
      <p>“So many players talk about Auckland. I have not been before, so this will be cool to experience."</p>
      <p>The prodigious teen has also been named in the Time 100 Next 2019, a list that identifies rising stars who are set to shape the future - not just in sport, but in the world in general.</p>
