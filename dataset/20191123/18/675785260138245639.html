      <h1>David Haye makes Deontay Wilder vs Luis Ortiz rematch prediction</h1>
      <h2>Wilder takes on Ortiz for the second time in 18 months having stopped the Cuban last time out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:52:55+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:52</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>David Haye has predicted an explosive and early victory for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> in his rematch with Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>The heavyweights clash tonight for the second time, 18 months after Wilder clung on to his world title with a 10th round stoppage.</p>
      <p>The American had to weather the storm that night, but Haye expects his former sparring partner to make light work of the tricky Cuban this time around.</p>
      <p>"I expect Deontay Wilder v Luis Ortiz II to go a lot smoother than the first fight, where the champion was badly hurt in one of the rounds," <a href="https://betting.betfair.com/betting/boxing/david-haye/david-haye-exclusive-on-deontay-wilder-v-luis-ortiz-221119-746.html">he wrote in his Betfair column.</a></p>
      <p>"Wilder certainly won't overlook Ortiz but the Cuban is a year older this time and Wilder is that much more mature. He is really settling into his game and has been adding a few extra pounds to his massive 6ft 6inch frame.</p>

      <p>"This fight will be very explosive, very fast and I just can't see Ortiz getting anything near the success he enjoyed in the first bout back in March 2018.</p>
      <p>"It is much more likely Wilder is going to put on another one of his power displays. He will be patient for one or two rounds, using that long, rangy jab but when he gets that right hand off, Ortiz is going to hit the deck and hit it hard.</p>
      <p>"We saw that in his first fight against Ortiz. Wilder had a horrendous round that night where he was taking punishment but went back to his stool and re-grouped.</p>

      <p>"He then came out and began firing back, getting himself back into the contest before going on to score the knockout.</p>
      <p>"I like Wider and if I were to train an opponent of his, my advice would be simple - try not to get hit with that dangerous right hand. My prediction for this fight is Deontay Wilder to win inside the first three rounds of the contest."</p>
