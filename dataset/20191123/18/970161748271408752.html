      <h3>When is the Celebrity X Factor final?</h3>
      <p>The final is next week, Saturday 30 November on ITV at 7.10pm.</p>
      <h3>What does the winner of X Factor: Celebrity get?</h3>
      <p>Like the ‘regular’ version of X Factor, the celebrities will win a record deal with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a>’s label, Syco.</p>
      <p>They’ll also be releasing a single in the hopes of nabbing the Christmas Number One.</p>
      <h3>Who is still in X Factor: Celebrity?</h3>
      <p>The semi-finals will be airing tonight on ITV from 7:40pm.</p>
      <p>Competing for a spot in next week’s final are:</p>
      <h3>Simon's Groups</h3>
      <p>Try Star</p>
      <p>V5</p>
      <p>Max and Havey</p>
      <h3>Nicole's Overs</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/vinnie-jones/">Vinnie Jones</a>
      </p>
      <p>Jenny Ryan</p>
      <h3>Louis' Unders</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/megan-mckenna/">Megan McKenna</a>
      </p>
      <p>However, Simon went rogue, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/simon-cowell-changes-the-x-factor-celebrity-rules-live-on-air-as-love-islanders-voted-off-11072658/">changing the rules live on air</a> and announcing a wild card return for the final next week, so after tonight’s show, that list will be missing some names and adding another.</p>

      <p>A rep for Ladbrokes has said: ‘Simon may as well crown Megan the winner now because it’s going to take a miracle to beat her at this stage.’</p>
      <h3>Will there be a second series of X Factor: Celebrity?</h3>
      <p>There hasn’t been another series confirmed… yet.</p>
      <p>The X Factor’s next incarnation will be X Factor: The Band which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/simon-cowell-axes-x-factor-stars-series-rival-little-mix-talent-show-battle-11037149/">replaced his idea of an ‘all stars’ X Factor</a>.</p>
      <p>His new show will look to find the next big group and will clash with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/little-mix/">Little Mix</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/little-mix-launch-talent-show-rival-simon-cowells-x-factor-10898950/">The Search</a> on the BBC.</p>
      <p>Simon has admitted <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/simon-cowell-admits-launched-x-factor-band-get-ahead-little-mix-didnt-want-follow-show-11083255/">he didn’t want to ‘follow’ their similar show,</a> and has compared their <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/simon-cowell-compares-little-mix-rivalry-blue-versus-oasis-x-factor-clash-continues-11090451/">rivalry to Blur and Oasis</a>.</p>
