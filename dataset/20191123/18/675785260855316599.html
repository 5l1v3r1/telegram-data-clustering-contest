      <p>Their red hot dance floor chemistry has seen them shoot to the top of the Strictly leaderboard.</p>
      <p>But despite their sizzling moves, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden have both rubbished rumours they have fallen victim to the Strictly 'curse'.</p>
      <p>The CBBC star has claimed her is far "too busy" to even think about romancing Amy.</p>
      <p>He said: "I don't really know about any rumours. I'm too busy learning to do this waltz than to worry about stuff like that."</p>
      <p>Karim also has a secret girlfriend, who he has been dating for three years.</p>

      <p>He is coupled up with university student, Poppy Birtwhistle, and both are keen to keep their relationship out of the public eye.</p>
      <p>But Amy and Karim have developed such a close bond she's already invited him to her wedding to Ben Jones next year.</p>
      <p>Amy said: "Karim is coming to my wedding next July. I'm so excited."</p>
      <p>And Karim wants to make sure Amy's big day is extra special - and is planning a huge surprise.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm doing a speech but she doesn't know that."</p>
      <p>Karim has gushed about his new found friend for life, Amy.</p>
      <p>He said: "We tease each other constantly and it goes a bit far and she nags me a bit - bit it's all out of love."</p>
      <p>Because of the close bond he has developed with Amy, Karim has been certain to include Poppy in his training and make sure she feels comfortable with his dance partner.</p>
      <p>Amy is the only close friendship Karim has struck up since he has been dancing on Strictly.</p>
      <p>The presenter and comedian Chris Ramsey have developed an adorable bromance and regularly go for sauna sessions to help them recover from training.</p>
      <p>Karim said: "I go to the sauna and steam most nights with Chris. Itâ€™s nice. We rest our weary bones and our worries roll away."</p>
