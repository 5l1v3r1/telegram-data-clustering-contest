      <p>Arsenal manager, Unai Emery says supporters can be “angry and frustrated” with his side after their 2-2 draw at home to Southampton in a <a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Premier League</a> match.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that a Alexandre Lacazette double at the Emirates on Saturday saved the Gunners from defeat.</p>
      <p>Asked about the atmosphere at the Emirates, Emery said: “I understand the supporters are angry.</p>
      <p>“The players are feeling the same and my job is to find out how to improve and the key is to be with the supporters. Our target was to win but also to play well and we didn’t do that.”</p>
      <p>Stuart Armstrong shot narrowly wide from 20 yards to give Arsenal a wake-up call in the opening minute but matters got worse for the hosts moments later.</p>
      <p>A quick Ryan Bertrand free-kick released Danny Ings who scampered into the box unopposed and stroked the ball past the on-rushing Bernd Leno, beating the goalkeeper with a shot that struck the near post and rolled into the net.</p>
      <p>The Saints’ poise in attack was undermined by their haphazard defending and Lacazette powered an equaliser home, finding the bottom-left corner of the net from 12 yards after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s effort rebounded to him.</p>
      <p>Emery sent on Nicolas Pepe, who promptly went clean through on goal but hesitated, allowing Jan Bednarek to get back and cut out the danger, before Nathan Redmond blazed over the crossbar from 20 yards at the other end.</p>
      <p>The game hung in the balance until Tierney brought down Ings to present Ward-Prowse with the opportunity to restore Southampton’s lead from the penalty spot and he scored at the second attempt, sweeping the ball into the unguarded net with Leno on the floor after making an initial save.</p>
      <p>Arsenal squandered numerous injury-time chances before substitute Gabriel Martinelli burst down the left and crossed deep to Lacazette, who reliably arrowed home from six yards to salvage a point.</p>
      <p>Emery is struggling to get the best out of his team as they failed to collect maximum points once again in a league match.</p>
      <p>The London club at home again on Thursday when Eintracht Frankfurt visit in the Europa League, while Southampton have a week to recover before entertaining Watford in the Premier League.</p>
