        <b>After finally releasing the first set of proper patch notes in Chapter 2, Epic confirmed that daily challenges are making a comeback in Fortnite, and leakers may have already found them all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Epic removed the tradition daily challenges back in August 2019, which annoyed some players as it essentially meant there was less to do if you were a ‘free’ player.</p>
      <p>Without buying the Battle Pass, there were more limited challenges available each day. But Epic quickly rectified things by confirming that the limited-time missions which were replacing them would be available to all players, even those without the battle pass.</p>

      <p>Daily challenges are back though, in addition to the continuing limited-time missions, confirmed in the v11.20 patch notes, with three available to complete each day.</p>

      <p>Each challenge will reward you with XP, and as mentioned, you don’t need to be a Battle Pass owner to access them – simply check the newest challenges when you log in each day.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-end-date-has-been-extended/27880/">Season 1 of Chapter 2 now extended until early February</a>, so we can expect to see this list of varied challenges rotate over the next few months, hopefully giving you a chance to complete all of them.</p>
      <p>As with all leaks, it’s important to note that things could change in development.</p>
