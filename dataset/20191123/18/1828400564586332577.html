      <p><b>READ MORE:</b> <a href="https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sport/football/blackpool-fc/simon-grayson-on-blackpool-s-draw-with-ipswich-town-the-two-penalties-and-joe-nuttall-s-first-league-goal-1-10118842"><b>Simon Grayson's verdict on Blackpool's 2-2 draw with Ipswich Town</b></a></p>
      <p>Goals from Joe Nuttall and Jay Spearing helped Pool extend their unbeaten run in all competitions to seven games.</p>
      <p>Ipswich edged ahead early on through Gwion Edwards, only to be pegged back by Nuttall's first league goal for the club.</p>
      <p>Jay Spearing's penalty saw Pool briefly take the lead at the start of the second half before the Tractor Boys levelled through a penalty of their own, Luke Garbutt the man to score.</p>
      <p>Both sides had chances to win the game late on but Lambert felt his side were always the more likely to snatch the three points.</p>
      <p>"I think we were the better team and Blackpool will be happier with the point," Lambert told the <i>East Anglian Daily Times</i>.</p>
      <p>"They set up to hit us on the counter-attack and we dominated the ball. That's probably the first time a team has come here and defended as deep as that.</p>
      <p>"I was really happy with how we played. We dominated the ball, they defended with a lot of guys behind the ball and their front two guys were dropping behind the halfway line and tried to stop us from playing.</p>
      <p>"That's their prerogative, I don't have a problem with that.</p>
      <p>"All credit to the team, we did everything we could to try and get the result. I was happy with the way we kept going."</p>
      <p>Lambert was unhappy with the officiating for both of Blackpool's goals.</p>
      <p>Nuttall bagged the equaliser midway through the second half as Pool capitalised on Cole Skuse going down with a knock during the build-up.</p>
      <p>The Ipswich players were then left furious when Sullay Kaikai was tripped for Pool's penalty, which skipper Jay Spearing dispatched.</p>
      <p>Ipswich also had an opportunity to snatch the win after equalising from the penalty spot themselves when Jay Spearing was forced to clear off the line.</p>
      <p>"Unless the rule has changed, I think a head injury is meant to stop the game isn't it?" Lambert added. "It happens. The referee calls it the way he sees it. That's the way it is.</p>
      <p>"For their penalty, I think the linesman has said to the referee there's no contact, but the referee still gave it. That's what I've heard. So, yeah...but that's football.</p>
      <p>"I haven't seen that one (goalline incident) back yet. One thing is for sure though, we make it exciting and always keep going."</p>
