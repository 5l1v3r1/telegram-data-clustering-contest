      <h1>Somebody Dug Up Old Joe Burrow Tweets That The LSU QB May Wanna Delete From His Account (PIC)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:15:51+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Once again, a high profiled athlete forgot to do a clean sweep of his Twitter account and he is certainly going to pay for it.</p>
      <p>LSU Tigers QB Joe Burrow has likely become the most-coveted QB on most draft boards after Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa suffered a dislocated hip in his last start.</p>
      <p>Before we get to that point, however, the 22-year-old will need to address his tweets that were unearthed by social media users that show him not only ripping commissioner Roger Goodell, but also taking a shot at the late Stuart Scott, as well as telling NBA teams to stop choosing foreigners in the Draft.</p>

      <p>Yea, this is not a good look for Burrow. Address it as soon as possible and it goes away.</p>
