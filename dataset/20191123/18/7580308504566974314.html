      <p>Managerless Bayern Munich went second in the Bundesliga on Saturday with a 4-0 romp at Fortuna Duesseldorf as leaders Borussia Moenchengladbach suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at Union Berlin.</p>
      <p>Bayern’s interim coach Hansi Flick enjoyed his third straight win since Niko Kovac was sacked earlier this month as Munich moved to within a point of Gladbach.</p>
      <p>A top-of-the-table showdown beckons in a fortnight when Gladbach host Bayern at Borussia Park.RB Leipzig can draw level on 24 points with Bayern if they win at home to strugglers Cologne later on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>Bayern routed Dusseldorf with goals by Philippe Coutinho, Serge Gnabry, Benjamin Pavard and Coretin Tolisso, with Robert Lewandowski failing to score in a league game for the first time this season and ending his record 11-match run.</p>
      <p>However it was the Poland forward who forced a corner from which Pavard scored the opening goal after 11 minutes.</p>
      <p>His France team-mate Tolisso then doubled the lead in the 27th minute after Duesseldorf’s US international Zack Steffen surrendered possession.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry, who scored a hat-trick in Germany’s 6-1 thrashing of Northern Ireland in mid-week, continued his goal-scoring run when he was presented with a simple tap-in by Thomas Mueller seven minutes later.</p>
      <p>Lewandowski turned provider again with the 70th-minute cross which Coutinho swept into the net to complete the rout.</p>
      <p>In Berlin, Gladbach suffered their third defeat this season as they became the latest top six club to lose to Union.</p>
      <p>Having already beaten Dortmund and Freiburg this season at their Alten Foersterei stadium, Union took the lead with 15 minutes gone when Nigeria striker Anthony Ujah headed home a cross.</p>
      <p>Union ensured their fourth straight league win in stoppage time when winger Julian Ryerson floated in a cross, which deflected off a Gladbach defender to present Swedish striker Sebastian Andersson with an easy header to round off a fine win.</p>
      <p>Schalke climbed to fourth as striker Benito Raman and midfielder Amine Harit scored their goals in a 2-1 win at Werder Bremen, whose Japanese striker Yuya Osako grabbed a late consolation.</p>
      <p>Freiburg are third despite only drawing 1-1 at ninth-placed Leverkusen.</p>
      <p>The visitors took the lead after only five minutes when forward Lucas Hoeler headed home at the far post after slipping his marker.</p>
      <p>But France Under-21 striker Moussa Diaby levelled on his first start for Leverkusen since joining from Paris Saint-Germain when he slotted home from 20 metres out midway through the first half.</p>
      <p>Despite playing with 10 men for the entire second-half, mid-table Wolfsburg managed a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Their goals came from towering Dutch striker Wout Weghorst and Brazilian forward Joao Victor despite losing defender Marcel Tisserand at the end of the first-half for a second bookable offence.</p>
