        <b>Unai Emery says he understands why fans are angry and frustrated at him following Arsenal 2-2 draw to Southampton.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Emery was under pressure from fans before the match and things got even worse for the Spaniard when James Ward-Prowse put Southampton 2-1 up with 20 minutes left after Alexandre Lacazette had equalised for Arsenal.</p>
      <p>The French striker salvaged a point for the home side when he scored his second of the game in the 96th minute, but boos rang around the Emirates at full time nonetheless.</p>
      <p>“We are disappointed, we are frustrated and I understand the supporters,” Emery said after the match.</p>
      <p>“We did deserve more today. We lost a very good opportunity to connect with our supporters, they helped us but really we know here (at home) is the key.</p>
      <p>“The first half, we were drawing but how we were playing wasn’t enough. We started the second-half better, we changed and I think it was the best 20 minutes of the whole season.</p>
      <p>“We drew in the last minute but that’s not enough. Really, we and the fans can be disappointed and angry because of the result.”</p>
      <p>Such is the unpopularity of Emery among the fans that their team’s last gasp goal was barely celebrated, and the manager says he understands their feelings.</p>
      <p>“I understand. I understand the frustration and the anger,” he told the BBC.</p>
      <p>“It is normal after Southampton and after the last matches, and all I can say to them is we are going to find a solution.</p>
      <p>“The player’s attitudes are good and we are going to work maybe more harder to achieve the best performances in the next matches.</p>
      <p>“The supporters can be angry and frustrated with us, but we are to work and improve to change our situation.</p>
