      <p>MEXICO -- Tyler Perry is trying to help a couple that says they're being held captive in a hospital in Mexico.<br/><br/>The media mogul learned about Stephen Johnson and Tori Austin from a report on "Good Morning America."<br/><br/>Johnson went into diabetic shock while on a Carnival cruise, so he was rushed to a hospital in the Yucatan peninsula.<br/><br/>The bill came out to $14,000 and the hospital will not allow the couple to leave until the bill is paid in full.<br/><br/>"They locked the windows and so far we just can't leave until this $14,000 dollar bill is paid," Austin said.<br/><br/>When Perry heard about the couple's ordeal, he quickly jumped into action and told them that he would pay their hospital expenses.<br/><br/>After Perry made the offer, the hospital said Johnson still requires more care, so unfortunately the couple is still there.</p>
