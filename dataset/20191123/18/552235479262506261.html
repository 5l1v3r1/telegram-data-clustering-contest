      <p>Irvine Meadow and Glenafton will contest a fourth round replay at Loch Park next Saturday after playing out a dull goalless draw this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A couple of penalty claims for the hosts and one clear cut chance apiece was all fans had to get excited about on a chilly day in Irvine.</p>
      <p>Meadow's best opportunity came right at the death, a silky sequence of one touch passes teeing up Mark McLennan for a clear strike from 16 yards, but his side-footed effort was parried past the post by Glens' keeper Davie Wilson.</p>
      <p>On the balance of play however, given how little either goalie had to do over the course of the 90 minutes, a draw was probably a fair result.</p>
      <p>It was a scrappy affair from the first whistle and fairly uneventful until Meadow were screaming for a penalty in 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>Brendan Sharpe seemed to be caught by Craig Pettigrew's trailing leg in the box, but referee William Wilson thought otherwise and booked the Medda frontman for diving.</p>
      <p>Glenafton's forwards weren't getting much change out of the Dow defence and it took an audacious 40 yard lob attempt from Pettigrew that dropped just the wrong side of the crossbar to give them their first glimpse of goal.</p>
      <p>A driving run and shot from Dale Moore then forced Paddy O'Neil into his first notable save, the Dow keeper getting down well at his near post to turn the ball behind for a corner.</p>
      <p>Meadow had another, albeit slightly half-hearted, appeal for a spot kick waved away when the ball bounced off the turf and hit Craig Menzies' hand as the centre-half beat Sharpe to Jared Willet's near post cross.</p>
      <p>Sixty seconds later, Sharpe went down in the box with two Glens defenders in close proximity. Whistler Wilson again gave nothing, leading to the visitors pleading in vain for the striker to receive a second yellow card.</p>
      <p>That was as good as it got in the first half and the second half wasn't much better.</p>
      <p>Glenafton started well, forcing a succession of early corner kicks which were dealt with by the hosts.</p>
      <p>Pettigrew then flashed a header wide of the target before Dale Moore drilled a dangerous ball across the six yard line that was just begging to be prodded home.</p>
      <p>Both sides rang the changesÂ  but they failed to make much difference.</p>
      <p>Neil Slooves fired over the Glens' bar after the ball fell to him on the edge of the box.</p>
      <p>At the other end, Finlay Frye headed a golden chance over from a corner kick after ghosting in at the back post.</p>
      <p>Then, in stoppage time, McLennan missed his opportunity to snatch victory.</p>
      <p>It sets up another intriguing meeting between the sides in New Cumnock next week, where a winner will be decided one way or another.</p>
