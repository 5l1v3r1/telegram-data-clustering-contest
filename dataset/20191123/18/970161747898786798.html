      <p>Strictly Come Dancing 2019 has been full of shocks since before the show even made it to air.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/21/what-happened-to-jamie-laing-and-why-did-he-quit-strictly-come-dancing-10784716/">Jamie Laing’s injury</a> to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancing-fans-gutted-michelle-visage-eliminated-facing-saffron-barker-dance-off-11172457/">gutting exit</a> or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/will-bayley-forced-quit-strictly-come-dancing-horrific-leg-injury-10991576/">Will Bayley having to quit</a>, it’s hard to pick the biggest ‘omg’ moment – but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chris-ramsey/">Chris Ramsey</a> could pull off a big surprise.</p>
      <p>The comedian has been impressing fans and judges, outstaying some early favourites like Michelle Visage.</p>
      <p>Ahead of his next appearance on Strictly, here’s a look at Chris’ personal and professional life off the dance floor.</p>

      <h3>Who is Chris Ramsey’s wife Rosie?</h3>

      <p>Together Chris and Rosie co-host the Shagged, Married, Annoyed Podcast.</p>
      <p>In the podcast, the two chat all about life, relationships, arguments, annoyances, parenting, growing up and everything in between, as well as answering questions from the public and a secret celebrity.</p>

      <p>Chris has joked that the success of the podcast is what will help him from falling for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/28/strictly-curse-struck-just-10823988/">Strictly curse</a>.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Lorraine, he said: ‘Everyone says about the Strictly curse but me and my wife have been together for seven years, married for five years. We have a three-year-old son but, more importantly, the top podcast in the UK. If you think I’m jeopardising that!’</p>
      <h3>How has Chris been performing on Strictly?</h3>
      <p>Chris avoided being in the dance-off, is constantly improving and has won plenty of fans – not least for a certain appendage that caught plenty of viewers’ attention last week (and now has its own Twitter account).</p>
