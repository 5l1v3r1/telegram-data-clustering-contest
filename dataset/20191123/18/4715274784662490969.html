      <p>OPM has confidently thrived not only through timeless hits that resonate with listeners here and abroad, but also because it has become even more affecting due to the complementary visuals of music videos.  As such, here are some of the latest music videos from ABS-CBN Music that will either make you want to hug a pillow or cry your eyes out: <b>“Maaari Ba” by Wilbert Ross</b></p>

      <p>It’s Showtime’s mainstay Hashtag Wilbert Ross proves his singing talent in his song “Maaari Ba.” The singer’s painful plea for an ex-lover to confront him about their relationship’s collapse is perfectly captured in its music video, which is starred on by Wilbert himself and YouTube vlogger Zeinab Harake. Its release last week hit the number one spot on YouTube Philippines’ Trending Videos chart, garnering 4.4 million views as of writing.  Video link here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prh0RYJEm6Q <b>“Kung ‘Di Na Ako” by Agsunta</b></p>

      <p>Rising OPM band Agsunta delivers another heart-wrenching message in their latest single “Kung ‘Di Na Ako,” which talks about the process of giving up on a lover who has already fallen in love with somebody else. The music video adds an even more somber tone to the track, which shows the bittersweet reunion of a couple with a painful past as they reconnect many years after their break-up. Video link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSCJh0GvFEs <b>“Tama Na” by Cane City</b></p>

      <p>Cane City, an alternative rock band under DNA Music, punches a hard-hitting jab in the heart through their latest song “Tama Na.” The ballad tackles the excruciating decision that lovers make to conclude their relationship, which was seamlessly interpreted in the music video by presenting a couple who broke up and are with other people already but seem to still be in love with each other. Video link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqWABez5SM <b>“Diyan Ba Sa Langit” by Morissette and Jason Dy</b></p>

      <p>The powerful vocalists’ much-awaited collaboration is surely a treat from heaven, as they show off their impressive pipes by belting out the song’s poignant lyrics. Although the record voices doubts on a love broken by death, it also subtly drops a little hope for when the couple gets to meet again. Watch out for the release of “Diyan Ba Sa Langit’s” music video soon, but for the meantime, its teaser can be watched via this link: https://www.instagram.com/p/B44xBCShn5V/</p>
