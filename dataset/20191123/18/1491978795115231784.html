        <i>Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool were ‘ready to fight for the result’ after his Premier League leaders escaped Crystal Palace with a dramatic 2-1 victory on Saturday. 'Could we have played better? Yes. We are not out there to break records. We are out there to get the best result over the full season,' Klopp said.  </i>
