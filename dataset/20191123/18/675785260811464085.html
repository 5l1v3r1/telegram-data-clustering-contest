      <p>Customers were left to clean popcorn off seats with their hands when they arrived at a filthy cinema.</p>
      <p>Rubbish, abandoned empty cups and large amounts of popcorn were strewn across Star City's Vue Cinema in Birmingham on November 17.</p>
      <p>Film-goers tried to clean some of the mess away so they could settle down and take in the showing without being immediately affected by the squalor, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/we-cleared-popcorn-hands-disgust-17285540">Birmingham Live reported</a> .</p>
      <p>A Vue spokesperson later admitted that a rota blunder meant the screen had not been cleaned.</p>
      <p>A 26-year-old, who asked not to be named, described entering the room with his mother and brother.</p>
      <p>"There were no clean seats," he said.</p>

      <p>"We had to move the popcorn with our own hands. It was all up the stairs."</p>
      <p>The man and his family members had spent £15 to see the late showing of Daaka, a Punjabi film.</p>
      <p>But on arrival, they were greeted by popcorn strewn across the floor, seats and stairs.</p>
      <p>Empty bottles still filled the cup holders and litter was seen dumped on every row from the last viewers.</p>

      <p>"We got there about 11.30pm, went to the counter and was waiting 5-6 minutes, so we got our tickets from the machine," he added.</p>
      <p>"We went in about 11.40 - 11.45pm. It was a complete mess. I took pictures and I complained to one of the staff members in the cinema and he apologised. But he didn't say why it happened.</p>
      <p>"While I was at the cinema I emailed Vue. I've tried to phone them but it kept getting disconnected."</p>
      <p>Vue issued an apology for the mess and sent the family three complimentary tickets.</p>

      <p>A company spokesperson said: “The images taken at our Star City site clearly don’t meet our high standards of cleanliness.</p>
      <p>"Following a review of the cleaning rota and system in place screen 10 was unfortunately overlooked on this evening.</p>
      <p>"This would normally not occur and management have taken action to ensure this can’t happen again.</p>
      <p>"We would like to apologise to customers who were affected.”</p>
