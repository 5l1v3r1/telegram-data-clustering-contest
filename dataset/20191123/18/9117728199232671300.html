        <b>Former F1 team owner Eddie Jordan thinks Nico Rosberg wouldn't have won any more championships against <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> after his title in 2016, when the German famously beat the Brit to the title before suddenly announcing his retirement from the sport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rosberg battled his childhood friend Hamilton for several years when the duo teamed up at <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> in 2013. The Silver Arrows weren't fighting at the top of the grid in that first season, but once the turbo-hybrid era kicked up in 2014, they started to dominate. </p>

      <p>Hamilton was crowned champion in both 2014 and 2015, beating Rosberg to the punch, but their relationship came to a boiling point in 2016. In their most dominant year as a constructor, they often collided on-track, most famously when they took each other out at the start of the Spanish Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>After somewhat surprisingly taking the title at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Rosberg suddenly announced his retirement only a few days later. According to Jordan, this was a smart decision.</p>

      <p><i>"Nico is a clever one as he decided to retire as he would have never won another championship if Lewis continued the way he has just done,"</i> Jordan told <i>Gulf News</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"Having said that Lewis is in his own realm. He can dominate the way he wants.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Teaming up with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> since 2017 onwards, Hamilton has won all three championships convincingly, with the Finn coming closest to his British teammate in 2019 as he won four races.</p>
