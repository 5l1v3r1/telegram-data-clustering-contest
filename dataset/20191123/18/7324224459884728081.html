      <h2>In August an Ashley Chambers strike at the Tameside Stadium earned Kidderminster Harriers a solitary goal win over Curzon Ashton, inflicting a first defeat of the season on the ‘Nash’ who then embarked on a winless run that was only ended with successive victories over Telford and York City.</h2>

      <p>The FA Trophy contest saw Harriers in action for the first time in three weeks looking to end a three game barren run and an opportunity to progress in a competition that has seen them reach four finals, the last in 2007 when they were beaten 3-2 by Stevenage Borough.</p>
      <p>Curzon’s James Baillie found himself in unchartered territory with only Tom Palmer to beat but his hesitation in the visitors box saw the early opportunity cleared.</p>
      <p>Harriers dominated possession but were unable to force a meaningful opening until the 34th minute.</p>
      <p>Richard Peniket was fouled by Mohamud Ali some 25 yards from goal, Declan Weeks and Ashley Hemmings contrived to confuse the home defence before Ashley Chambers set up Hemmings and the visiting midfielder crashed a curling 20 yard left footed drive against the crossbar with Cam Mason beaten.</p>
      <p>On the stroke of half time the home side forged ahead with a wonder strike from Mike Calveley.</p>
      <p>Harriers had defended well and cleared the dangerous cross from Nicky Wroe some 30 yards from goal but Calveley raced forward and delivered a telling right footed effort that flew into the top right hand corner of Tom Palmer’s goal.</p>
      <p>The home side always looked more threatening despite Harriers possession and with 14 minutes remaining, Jake Baillie’s right wing cross was taken by Tom Palmer who collided with Cliff Moyo and Charlie Jolley was gifted with an opening goal with which to net Curzon’s second.</p>
      <p>Worse was to follow with 84 minutes played, Sean Miller carved open the Harriers defence and his precision pass to Connor Dimaio saw the striker round Palmer to fire Curzon into the first round of the FA Trophy.</p>
      <p>Ollie Shenton forced Mason into a save on 86 minutes, Harriers first shot on target, to leave the visitors nursing bruised pride and another free Saturday before Xmas.</p>
