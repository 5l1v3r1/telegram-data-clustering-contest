        <b>Preston North End manager Alex Neil says a poor first-half showing proved his side's undoing in the 1-0 defeat to Derby County at Pride Park.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Lilywhites were very much second best to their hosts for 45 minutes and could count themselves fortunate to have gone in at the interval only one-goal down.</p>
      <p>In fact Neil admitted being 1-0 down at the break had flattered his side and it was a relief to hear the half-time whistle.</p>
      <p>A double substitution at half-time and a change of approach led to a better second-half show from North End but it wasn't enough to get anything from the contest.</p>
      <p>Tom Barkhuizen did have the ball in the net when he got the last touch on a Ben Davies shot but he was flagged offside.</p>
      <p>Neil said: "We didn't do anything well in the first half across the pitch, I didn't think our kicking up to Jayden Stockley was good enough, we didn't feed him enough balls.</p>
      <p>"We didn't pick any second balls up, we didn't get tight enough. We were just really poor and to be fair to Derby, they were excellent.</p>
      <p>"The best thing in the first half was the half-time whistle for us because 1-0 flattered us in the first half.</p>
      <p>"For the second half we made two changes, altered the way we played and I thought we then controlled the game.</p>
      <p>"But I think Derby then sat back and tried to hit us on the counter. They didn't create too much to hurt us in the second half.</p>
      <p>"We probably had two opportunities and didn't get anything.</p>
      <p>"Tom Barkhuizen had the ball in the net and by all accounts it could quite easily have been given - he was in line-ish and it was difficult to say if he was offside or not.</p>
      <p>"Then Jordan Storey has a great chance when he hit the post. But it is the first half which has cost us."</p>
      <p>The half-time double change saw Paul Gallagher and Billy Bodin replace Darnell Fisher - on a yellow card - and centre-forward Stockley.</p>
      <p>Barkhuizen went up front, Daniel Johnson played as the No.10 and Gallagher played deeper next to Ben Pearson.</p>
      <p>Neil said: "Before the game I was sort of caught in between of how to play.</p>
      <p>"Jayden had played the last three games and done particularly well but we had a different way of playing before that and I was caught in between how to approach this one.</p>
      <p>"We can't blame that for the first-half performance, how you move the ball, how you compete dictates whether you will have a chance.</p>
      <p>"Formations weren't the be all and end all, albeit it did improve in the second half but by then we were chasing the game."</p>
      <p>Centre-half Davies came off after 72 minutes with an ankle injury and is an early doubt for Wednesday night's trip to Hull City.</p>
