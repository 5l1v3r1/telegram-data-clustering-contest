      <p>Police believe that French Montana was ‘intoxicated’ after he was rushed to the hospital, although sources close to the rapper have strongly denied this.</p>
      <p>French – real name Karim Kharbouch – was sent to hospital on Thursday after experiencing ‘cardiac issues’, but police suspect he may have been under the influence, according to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/22/french-montana-911-call-intoxicated-hospital/">TMZ.</a></p>
      <p>Police were said to have attended French’s Calabasas home after a neighbour reportedly called 911, believing a robbery was taking place.</p>
      <p>Officers subsequently stormed the house and handcuffed several people, with French said to be asleep in his bedroom.</p>
      <p>When the police woke him up he reportedly begun yelling at them, as he was unware of what was going on, before he ultimately collapsed. Officers subsequently called for an ambulance.</p>
      <p>Audio of a 911 call obtained by TMZ see officers talking about the 35-year-old, with the word ‘intoxicated’ heard toward the end.</p>

      <p>They said he ‘seemed out of it’ and was suffering from stomach pain, nausea and an elevated heart rate, which needed urgent medical attention.</p>
      <p>French was later taken to a nearby hospital and TMZ reported that he was suffering ‘scary cardiac issues and intense nausea’, but he was ‘awake and alert’ and was receiving treatment including IV fluids.</p>
      <p>Sources close to the rap star suspect that the cause of his health issues could be contaminated food, and they mentioned he had been travelling around Europe and the Middle East in the past few weeks.</p>
      <p>French had been to visit his native family back in his native Morocco, before returning to his home in Los Angeles.</p>
