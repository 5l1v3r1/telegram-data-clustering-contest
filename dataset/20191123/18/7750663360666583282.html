      <p>Waghorn diverted the ball in from close range in the first half and Derby could have had more goals against a strangely subdued Preston who created little.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/declan-rudd/"><b>Declan Rudd</b></a> kept them in the game with saves from Waghorn and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-lawrence/"><b>Tom Lawrence</b></a> with Preston's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-barkhuizen/"><b>Tom Barkhuizen</b></a> hitting the top of the bar in the second half.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/craig-forsyth/"><b>Craig Forsyth</b></a> returned to the Derby side a year after suffering a third serious knee injury in place of injured central defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matt-clarke/"><b>Matt Clarke</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/phillip-cocu/"><b>Phillip Cocu</b></a>'s side made a confident start with Lawrence firing narrowly wide from distance in the fifth minute.</p>
      <p>But Preston had a good chance four minutes later when a free kick set up  <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-johnson/"><b>Daniel Johnson</b></a> and, when his shot was blocked, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/patrick-bauer/"><b>Patrick Bauer</b></a> fired over from 10 yards.</p>
      <p>Derby had to make a change in the 15th minute when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/graeme-shinnie/"><b>Graeme Shinnie</b></a> appeared to suffer a hamstring injury and was replaced by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/george-evans/"><b>George Evans</b></a> but the home side went close twice in the space of two minutes.</p>
      <p>First <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/duane-holmes/"><b>Duane Holmes</b></a> rattled the bar with a volley before Lawrence broke away in the 19th minute and hit a low drive which Rudd turned behind.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jayden-stockley/"><b>Jayden Stockley</b></a> fired just wide but Derby almost broke through when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mason-bennett/"><b>Mason Bennett</b></a> was brought down just outside the box by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/darnell-fisher/"><b>Darnell Fisher</b></a> who was booked.</p>
      <p>Bennett limped off in the 28th minute and his replacement Waghorn had a great chance three minutes later when Holmes put him through but Rudd turned his shot over.</p>
      <p>But Waghorn was in the right place in the 33rd minute when a corner was headed on and he chested it past Rudd from six yards.</p>
      <p>Preston could have no complaints because they had been second best but Derby had a scare in stoppage time when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kelle-roos/"><b>Kelle Roos</b></a> dropped a free kick but the visitors could not take advantage.</p>
      <p>Derby had another chance in the 54th minute when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/krystian-bielik/"><b>Krystian Bielik</b></a>'s pass put Waghorn in but his shot was easily saved.</p>
      <p>Preston had the ball in the net three minutes later but the flag was up for offside and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jayden-bogle/"><b>Jayden Bogle</b></a> was close to adding a second with a shot that went just wide in the 64th minute.</p>
      <p>But Derby were dropping deeper and had a scare in the 77th minute when a free kick dropped to Barkhuizen who grazed the bar with a 15 yard shot.</p>
      <p>Preston dominated possession in the closing minutes but could not fashion a clear chance as Derby held on for a fifth successive Pride Park victory.</p>
