      <p>Alexandre Lacazette on Saturday, November 23, scored a late minute goal which saved Arsenal from an embarrassing Premier League home defeat against Southampton as it ended 2-2</p>
      <p>The Gunners knew before the match that they had the chance of going fifth on the Premier League standings if they win, but they were unable to beat their visitors.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery's men had the first chance to score in the 4th minute when Mesut Ozil located Aubameyang with a fine pass, but the Gabon international was unable to beat McCarthy.</p>
      <p>Southampton took the lead at the Emirates stadium in the 8th minute through Danny Ings who benefited from an assist by Ryan Bertrand.</p>

      <p>But the Gunners restored parity in the 18th minute through Alexandre Lacazette who scored a superb goal to the delight of all Arsenal fans.</p>
      <p>Arsenal were anxiously looking for the winner in the second half, but they were unable to get it and instead conceded a goal in the 71st minute through James Ward Prowse.</p>
      <p>Alexandre Lacazette eventually netted the late minute goal which gave Arsenal a point at the Emirates stadium against Southampton as the match ended 2-2.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Arsenal manager Unai Emery seems to be the next manager whose seat <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277415-unai-emery-arsenal-boss-faces-sack-mauricio-pochettino.html">in Premier League is threatened</a> after the disgraceful sack of Mauricio Pochettino's by Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The Argentine manager was relieved of his position on Tuesday, November 19, with Jose Mourinho taking over the affairs of the North London side in what signals his surprising yet sensational return to the Premier League.</p>
