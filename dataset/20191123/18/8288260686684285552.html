      <p>Garraway's husband Derek Draper has opened up about the moment his heart broke while watching her on I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Appearing with their two children Bill and Darcey, Derek heaped praise on Kate, 52.</p>
      <p>He told hosts "The only bit where I felt really upset for her was something people might not have noticed when there was some good news delivered about the food - Wagon Wheels I think it was.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s jumping in and hugging and she turned to hug someone but everyone was already hugging someone.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to dive through the television and give her a massive hug.”</p>
      <p>“It is hard watching her struggle with things but equally I know how much she likes a challenge so in a way I know deep down she’s having the time of her life,” he said.</p>

        <b>I'm A Celebrity airs tonight at 9pm on ITV.</b>
