        <i>When we were students, we only received several times of sex education at school and that was about it. Many children and adolescents do not have access to proper sex education, and it‚Äôs worse when parents refuse to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù with them. Youngsters would then turn to pornographic contents for the wrong information and assumptions about sex and their bodies.</i>

      <p>An announcement was made by the Deputy Education Minister, Teo Nie Ching, that <b>starting from 2021, students will learn about statutory rape and related issues, such as child grooming and sexual harassment</b>. These topics will be included in the Pendidikan Jasmani dan Kesihatan (PJK) syllabus and Physical Education textbooks for Form 5 and Year 6 students. Teo shared this piece of news at an event organized by the Women‚Äôs Aid Organisation (WAO) today (23 November), as reported on <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/11/23/statutory-rape-to-be-part-of-subjects-in-school-from-2021/">Free Malaysia Today</a>.</p>

      <p>She added that students need to be taught that any sexual activity involving girls who are under 16 is a crime, regardless of the presence of consent. Because the age of consent in Malaysia is 16 years old for both boys and girls, this type of activity is categorised as statutory rape under Malaysia‚Äôs Penal Code.</p>

      <blockquote>‚ÄúThe law is there, but if it‚Äôs not taught to the kids, then how would they know (about it)? We have to highlight certain laws to the kids. We cannot just presume that they know.‚Äù</blockquote>

        <i>As much as we are glad that effort is being put into school materials to educate the children, ultimately, it would be more effective if parents are open towards educating their children on this topic. Nothing is more important than teaching children to protect themselves with correct information than to risk having them being involved in illegal sexual activities.</i>
