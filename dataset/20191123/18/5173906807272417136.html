        <b>Americans Foo Fighters will perform on 21 June at the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival in the Bela Vista Park, the organization announced on 22 November.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dave Grohl's band is the first confirmation of the festival's poster, whose ninth edition is scheduled for 20, 21, 27 and 28 June in Lisbon.</p>
      <p>The return to Portugal will come at a time when the band will be celebrating 25 years of career, starting in late 1994, when Dave Grohl, then Nirvana drummer, recorded a series of songs that would be part, a year later, of Foo Fighters' first album.</p>
      <p>Last September Dave Grohl revealed that the band would be working on a new album, successor to 2017's "Concrete &amp; Gold", possibly to be released in 2020.</p>
      <p>Foo Fighters' relationship with the Portuguese public dates back to 1998, when they performed at Expo'98, in Lisbon, and at the Porto Coliseum. They then had two albums, "Foo Fighters" (1995) and "The Colour and the Shape" (1997).</p>
      <p>In these two decades, they have also gone through the festivals of Paredes de Coura and Alive (Oeiras). In 2004 they performed at the first edition of the Rock in Rio Lisboa festival.</p>
      <p>For the 2020 edition, the festival promises two weekends with 12 hours of daily entertainment in 14 venues, including concerts, dancing, games, a Ferris wheel and a roller coaster.</p>
