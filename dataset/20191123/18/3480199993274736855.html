      <p>Harrogate recovered from an early Chesterfield goal to claim a 3-1 home victory in the Vanarama National League.</p>
      <p>The struggling Spireites took the lead after 10 minutes when a shot from Liam Mandeville rebounded off the post and was tapped in by Mike Fondop-Talum.</p>
      <p>Harrogate then drew level eight minutes before half-time, with Josh Falkingham latching on to a ball from Jack Muldoon and chipping an effort into the right-hand corner.</p>
      <p>Muldoon provided another assist in the 65th minute, this time aiding Ryan Fallowfield as Harrogate began to take control of the game.</p>
      <p>Muldoon was again involved as the hosts claimed a third goal, rounding the keeper to score in his own right and seal the victory for Town.</p>
