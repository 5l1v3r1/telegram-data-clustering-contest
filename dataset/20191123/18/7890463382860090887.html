      <h1>ShockRods is making the player community a big part of game development</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/shockrods">ShockRods</a> is one of those games that takes two great ideas and fuses them into one: In this case, it’s the high-speed R/C action of Rocket League crossed with the frantic violence of Quake III. Developer Stainless Games says it’s relying on player feedback to hone that fighting edge and make ShockRods the game its community truly desires.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to our <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/shockrods/community-development">sister site The Loadout</a>, Stainless Games associate producer Sam Corser explained that it’s normal now for games to evolve over time, and that the studio is incorporating that into ShockRods’ development.</p>
      <p>“We’re trying to get the game out into the hands of people and we want them to tell us where they feel the game should evolve,” he said. “The community is really powerful – they know what they like and what they want – and we want our games to be fun.”</p>
      <p>Corser says the production team is thinking about ShockRods as an esport, at least internally. But the team believes that pushing the esports idea onto players would be a mistake.</p>
      <p>“If you deliberately try to make a game like that, they say ‘shove it, bud,'” Corser said. “Do we hope it becomes an esport? Why not. We treat it that way in the office.”</p>
      <p>Stainless Games has some of the brains behind the Carmageddon series working on ShockRods, and they’re undoubtedly folks who know a thing or two about making violence and cars work together nicely. The game has been developed with support from Green Man Gaming’s indie publishing program, and it’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/647640/ShockRods/">available on Steam</a>.</p>
