        <b>Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool struggled against Crystal Palace as they weren’t compact enough following his side’s narrow 2-1 win.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sadio Mane gave the league leaders the lead early in the second half before Wilfried Zaha equalised for Crystal Palace. A late penalty from Roberto Firmino though was enough to give Liverpool all three points.</p>
      <p>“They [Crystal Palace] worked hard, I can only imagine what Roy Hodgson is feeling like because they would have deserved a point today. But we won the game and it was deserved today as well,” Klopp said after the match.</p>
      <p>“We weren’t compact enough. Our distances between the full-backs and midfielders were too big. The set pieces were really dangerous and gave them the time to go there.</p>
      <p>“It was a tough job to do today and at the end of the day I am happy with the result and big parts of the performances as well.”</p>
      <p>It could’ve easily been a different result for Liverpool, with James Tomkins’s initial equaliser for Palace being harshly ruled out by VAR for a foul on Dejan Lovren.</p>
      <p>“I’m not surprised at all that it was tough,” Klopp added.</p>
      <p>“We knew at half time that we had to do better. We said we just have to make sure you are ready to fight right from the very start.</p>
      <p>Getting a result at Crystal Palace, we will never take it for granted.”</p>
