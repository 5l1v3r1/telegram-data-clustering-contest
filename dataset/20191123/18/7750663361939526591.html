      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexandre-lacazette/"><b>Alexandre Lacazette</b></a> rescued an injury-time point for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/arsenal/"><b>Arsenal</b></a> at home to struggling <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> – but the result will do little to ease the pressure on head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The Gunners boss was given public backing by the club’s hierarchy during the international break but he was reliant on a Lacazette brace to twice bring his side from behind to earn a 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>The south-coast side have not won a league game at Arsenal since 1987 but looked on course to end that run as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-ward-prowse/"><b>James Ward-Prowse</b></a> tapped home after having a penalty saved by Leno, cancelling out Lacazette’s first following <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-ings/"><b>Danny Ings</b></a>’ opener for the visitors.</p>

      <p>Arsenal are now winless in six games across all competitions and have celebrated victory in just two of their last 11 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ralph-hasenhuttl/"><b>Ralph Hasenhuttl</b></a>’s side, this would have been a much-needed morale boost but they have not won in the league since September 14.</p>
      <p>While bitter rivals Tottenham celebrated victory at West Ham earlier in the day having opted to sack <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> and replace him with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>, Arsenal put in another mediocre display.</p>
      <p>The club may have stuck by Emery but the jeers which greeted the full-time whistle suggests the majority of supporters may soon be calling for a change.</p>

      <p>Southampton had a great early chance as Stuart Armstrong robbed former Celtic team-mate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kieran-tierney/"><b>Kieran Tierney</b></a> of possession with a little over 30 seconds gone but he could only shot wide.</p>
      <p>The lead would belong to the visitors nine minutes later as they caught the Arsenal defence napping.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nathan-redmond/"><b>Nathan Redmond</b></a> was fouled by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/calum-chambers/"><b>Calum Chambers</b></a> and the recalled <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-bertrand/"><b>Ryan Bertrand</b></a> played a quick free-kick into Ings, who ran in on Leno’s goal and converted the opener off the inside of the post.</p>
      <p>Lacazette would equalise as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pierre-emerick-aubameyang/"><b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</b></a>’s shot was blocked into the path of his strike partner, who made no mistake in turning home his first goal since September 1.</p>

      <p>The rest of the half was a scrappy affair, Southampton already happy to start running down the clock while Arsenal still proved wasteful in possession as a smattering of jeers from the home fans greeted the half-time whistle.</p>
      <p>Emery responded by reverting to a back four and introducing club-record signing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolas-pepe/"><b>Nicolas Pepe</b></a> in place of Chambers.</p>
      <p>Saints goalkeeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-mccarthy/"><b>Alex McCarthy</b></a> was called into action soon after the restart to keep out Aubameyang after the ball had broken fortuitously into the path of the Arsenal skipper.</p>
      <p>Pepe then summed up his start to life in England as he was slipped through behind the Southampton defence and ran in one-on-one against McCarthy before attempting to square to a team-mate instead of take on the strike.</p>

      <p>The Ivory Coast forward did well to make contact with Tierney’s cross but his scissor kick came back off the woodwork.</p>
      <p>Emery’s side started to control proceedings but were lucky not to fall behind a second time as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sokratis-papastathopoulos/"><b>Sokratis Papastathopoulos</b></a> dallied and lost the ball to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cedric-soares/"><b>Cedric Soares</b></a> inside his own penalty area.</p>
      <p>The Portugal full-back’s cross evaded <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-obafemi/"><b>Michael Obafemi</b></a>, the young forward six yards out from an open goal but unable to make contact.</p>
      <p>Another error would see Southampton take the lead with 20 minutes remaining as Tierney pulled back on Ings following a ball back into the box, with referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stuart-atwell/"><b>Stuart Atwell</b></a> pointing to the spot.</p>

      <p>Ward-Prowse stepped up but saw his low penalty kept out by Leno, only to tuck away the rebound and celebrate in front of the travelling support.</p>
      <p>Emery turned to youngsters <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gabriel-martinelli/"><b>Gabriel Martinelli</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-willock/"><b>Joe Willock</b></a> and it was the latter who had a header well-saved by McCarthy.</p>
      <p>The England Under-21 international was then heavily involved at the other end as he raced back to clear <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/moussa-djenepo/"><b>Moussa Djenepo</b></a>’s goalbound shot off the line.</p>
      <p>A number of stoppages led to seven minutes of injury-time as Djenpo spurned a fine chance to seal the points and it proved to be costly as Lacazette thrashed home at the back-post to salvage a point which does little for Emery’s current standing.</p>
