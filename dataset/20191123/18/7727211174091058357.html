      <p>A motorcyclist was taken to hospital after a crash with a car this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A police patrol was returning to a south Liverpool station when it came across the collision, reported at around 3.13pm, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/speke">on Speke Boulevard.</a></p>
      <p>The road, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/traffic-and-travel">near the junction with Woodend Avenue,</a> was closed for a short period of time.</p>
      <p>It has now been reopened and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">a spillage of fuel cleared.</a></p>
      <p>The crash, which happened close to the Riverside Credit Union building, occurred between the motorbike and a Mazda car.</p>
      <p>The man suffered a leg injury, although it is not believed to be serious.</p>

      <p>Suggestions on social media that a police car was involved in the smash are understood to be wide of the mark.</p>
