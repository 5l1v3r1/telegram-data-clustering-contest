      <p>MILWAUKEE - A federal report shows that Wisconsin's job growth dropped dramatically in the first half of 2019, although economists say there's little cause for concern.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Department of Labor says the state had 2,945,000 nonfarm jobs through June, up 9,340 from the same period last year. That lagged well behind the year-over-year increases for every June since the recession ended a decade ago. From June 2017 to June 2018, Wisconsin added 27,000 jobs. The previous year, the state added 35,000.</p>
      <p>Dennis Winters, chief economist for the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, tells the Journal Sentinel that job growth has slowed nationally and in many other states. He says a key reason is that unemployment continues to be low, at 3.3% in Wisconsin in October and 3.6% nationally.</p>
      <p>Winters says many business owners would expand if they had the workforce.</p>
