      <p>Iconic props from Friends are set to be auctioned off – and could we be anymore excited about it?</p>
      <p>From Joey’s Hugsy penguin to the Central Perk sofa and the famous Turkey that Monica wore on her head (as if we could forget) – yes that’s right you could own them – but at a hefty price.</p>
      <p>The auction, <a href="http://propstore.com/Friends">organised by Prop Store</a>, will offer more than 100 items that span across all 10 seasons of the sitcom at auction houses based out of London, England and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/valencia/">Valencia</a>, California, next month.</p>
      <p>Hugsy and the wedding invitation are expected to fetch between $1,000 and $1,500 (£750-£1,150) with Chandler’s wood canoe potentially selling for $6,000 (£4,600).</p>
      <p>Brandon Alinger, COO of Prop Store, said: ‘Prop Store is thrilled to be working with Warner Bros to auction some incredible material from all 10 seasons of Friends.</p>
      <p>‘The series gave us so many laughs during its original run and continues to entertain and inspire fans around the world.</p>

      <p>Some items are being estimated to sell for prices as high as $8,000, for the famous orange Central Perk couch, or even $14,800 for Ross’s giant holiday armadillo costume.</p>

      <p>The best part about the auction is that the VHS of the spoof porn film made by Phoebe’s sister Ursula, Buffay the Vampire Layer, is also up for sale.</p>
      <p>Also, in case you need a costume to teach your son about Hannukah, the Armadillo costume Ross wore might be the one for you.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the auction will benefit The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organisation for LGBTQ+ young people.</p>
      <p>The news follows after the cast announced that they would be up for a reboot of Friends.</p>
      <p>The Hollywood Reporter has said that all six cast members – Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, David Schwimmer and Matthew Perry – are all set to be involved, but this is unconfirmed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sorry, this video isn't available any more.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The publication made it clear that a deal ‘is far from done and agreements with cast and creatives still need to be hammered out’.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Aniston previously whipped everybody into a frenzy after she joined Instagram – and made her first post <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/jennifer-aniston-finally-joins-instagram-reveals-full-friends-cast-reunion-dinner-10923143/">a picture of herself and her co-stars back together.</a></p>
      <p>The actress later confirmed to Ellen DeGeneres that on the show’s 25th anniversary <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/28/jennifer-aniston-working-something-friends-co-stars-not-reboot-10998823/">there might be something in the making.</a></p>

      <p>‘We would love for there to be something, but we don’t know what that something is. So we’re just trying,’ she said, adding: ‘We’re working on something.’</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/year-friends-start-date-first-episode-received-11065441/">Friends originally began in September 1994</a> and ran for 10 years, with the final ever episode airing on 6 May 2004.</p>
      <p>As it stands there are no plans for Friends to be spun off on to the big screen – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/jennifer-aniston-addresses-friends-movie-never-happened-despite-interest-cast-10912580/">and Jennifer Aniston recently spoke about why it’s unlikely to happen.</a></p>
