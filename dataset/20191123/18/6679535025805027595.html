      <h1>Car driver survives to tell the tale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:17:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Abhinay-Deshpande-13835/" target="_blank">Abhinay Deshpande</a></address>
      <p>Usually, on weekdays, scores of people can be seen waiting for autorickshaws and buses at the busy Biodiversity Junction, where the car crash-landed. However, Saturday being a weekly-off for most of the IT companies, only a few were waiting there. Otherwise, the number of casualties would have been high.</p>
      <p>Among the people who were waiting at the auto stand was Pasala Naga Venkata Satyaveni, 40, a home-maker and her younger daughter, P. Pranitha, 23, from Manikonda.</p>
      <p>While Satyaveni was killed after a speeding car fell on her from the Biodiversity Flyover, her daughter was traumatised by the accident and admitted to a nearby hospital.</p>
      <p>They were going to KPHB Colony in search of a house for rent. Surya Narayana, the victim’s husband, works at a private firm in Madhapur, and was facing difficulty in commuting from Manikonda.</p>
      <p>The couple migrated to Hyderabad from Tadepalligudem in West Godavari district and their two daughters are software engineers.</p>
      <p>K Kubra, 23, an engineering graduate from Anantapur, came to the State capital a week ago in search of a job. Apparently, she was returning to her hostel after attending a job interview.</p>
      <p>“Kubra, who was waiting at the auto stand, suffered multiple pelvic fractures and is undergoing treatment,” police said.</p>
      <p>Balu Naik, an auto-rickshaw driver who had a miraculous escape said, “after seeing the car hit me, I quickly reacted to save myself and started to run, but unfortunately the car tyre hit me with great force.” Mr. Naik’s left leg was fractured.</p>
      <p>Another auto driver Kranti Kumar said that the car crashed a few feet away from him before it went on to hit the victims. “It was a very unfortunate accident and I consider myself lucky,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, another eyewitness, Praveen , a private employee from Ramanthapur, said that it took them at least 15 minutes to pull out the accused driver, Kalvakuntla Krishnamilan Rao from the mangled car.</p>
      <p>“After pulling him out from the car, the man himself walked towards the ambulance,” he said.</p>
