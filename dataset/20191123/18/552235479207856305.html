      <h1>Neil Lennon makes Celtic and Rangers title race claim as he heaps praise on Hoops star for handling pressure</h1>
      <h2>The Celtic boss believes his side are in a proper title race for the first time in years but is delighted with how his players are performing.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:57:02+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:57</time> by <a rel="author">Scott McDermott, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/scott-mcdermott/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic moved three points clear in the Premiership to put the onus on rivals Rangers – and gaffer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> says he's relishing the Old Firm title race.</p>
      <p>The champions did their job with a convincing 4-0 victory over Livingston at Parkhead which gave them daylight at the top.</p>
      <p>Lennon admits he'll enjoy 24 hours at the summit before seeing how Gers get on at Hamilton this afternoon.</p>
      <p>But with both clubs neck-and-neck, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> boss knows his side face a real challenge to make it 9-in-a-row.</p>
      <p>He said: “Does it feel like a proper title race? At the minute, no question, yes.</p>
      <p>“Psychologically, that's a good win for us. We can enjoy our Sunday, we get 24 hours before seeing what <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers'</a> result brings before we move on to the next one.</p>

      <p>“We'll put this one to bed and it was a tough game under the circumstances.</p>
      <p>“But we dealt with it brilliantly. You've got to either relish this pressure or fear it.</p>
      <p>“So let's relish it. It's great. Maybe it's something new for some of the players but they're taking on the challenge – and I think the fans are enjoying it too.</p>
      <p>“There will be anxious moments as we go along, with dips and troughs. But we're in a strong position and playing brilliantly.”</p>
      <p>Lennon praised his side's attitude as they got revenge on Livi for beating them at Almondvale in October.</p>
      <p>A James Forrest double and strikes from skipper <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-brown">Scott Brown</a> and Odsonne Edouard sealed the win and afterwards, the manager said: “We were very powerful. Not just because of our fitness levels and the way we battled for second balls – but our football was superb.</p>
      <p>“It was a comprehensive win against a tough team to beat.</p>
      <p>“We were outstanding and when you come back from two weeks off you always worry that momentum will be lost.</p>
      <p>“But there was no sign of that at all. There were excellent individual performances but I could name all of them, really.</p>

      <p>“There wasn't one weakness out there and I'm thrilled with that.</p>
      <p>“Their attitude is first class, in terms of how we approached it. These games can bite you but our professionalism and intent was terrific.</p>
      <p>“We asked them to pile on the pressure in the second half with more goals.</p>
      <p>“I thought they'd declared at three but then got another one. They're giving me everything, including another clean sheet.</p>
      <p>“It's a great start to this block of games coming up.”</p>
      <p>Lennon was able to give Leigh Griffiths minutes from the bench as he replaced Edouard in the second half.</p>
      <p>And he's urged the striker to stay fresh and fit so he can make a contribution to their title tilt.</p>
      <p>He said: “You can see how popular Leigh is with the fans. He's still got a bit to do but he was sniffing out chances and his work rate was good.</p>
      <p>“It's a timely comeback from him with the volume of games we've got.</p>
      <p>"We just want him to stay fit and at that level because there's plenty more to come from him.”</p>
