      <h1>The free-agent advantage Gerrit Cole, other stars are missing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:49:08+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:49</time> by <a rel="author">Joel Sherman</a></address>
      <p>Will Smith and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/former-mets-target-yasmani-grandal-signs-73-million-deal-with-white-sox/">Yasmani Grandal</a> were not the best free agents. They are not Gerrit Cole or Stephen Strasburg or Anthony Rendon. They were the most distinct, though. That is why, well before Thanksgiving, they became the first free agents to receive multi-year deals to join new teams.</p>
      <p>Yes, Cole, Strasburg and Rendon are Scott Boras clients, and that often entails a drawn-out process through the offseason. But when it comes to Cole, there is a Strasburg and even a Zack Wheeler or others to consider at the next level if you miss out on the best available starter. If a third-base-hungry team fails on Rendon, there is Josh Donaldson still on the free-agent market, and then Mike Moustakas.</p>
      <p>There are legitimate alternatives.</p>
      <p>But the gap between Smith (Braves) and the next best lefty reliever on the free-agent market and, especially, Grandal (White Sox) and the next-best catcher were so significant that teams had to act — and now — or else lack a comfortable fallback position.</p>
      <p>This is how the free-agent market works now. Teams will pay for elite players with prime years still ahead of them — Cole and Rendon this offseason, Bryce Harper and Manny Machado last year. Or they will pay for what is rare in the marketplace, such as a lefty reliever who is effective against lefties and righties and has proven he can pitch in high leverage situations or a switch-hitting catcher who is excellent on both sides of the ball.</p>

      <p>I would never say there is no collusion, because MLB teams have been found to collude in the free-agent market previously. But I think what has left the union frustrated is a collusion of thought on how front offices assess players. More analytic clubs generally will no longer invest big money (especially for multiple years) on players in their 30s, players who are not elite and players who are not distinct.</p>
      <p>At the recent GM meetings, one AL executive used the righty-relief market as an example. This executive said he wanted to add a righty reliever. But from a pool of about 10 interesting guys — including Steve Cishek, Will Harris, Daniel Hudson, Joe Smith, Craig Stammen, etc. — that his team had ranked, there was not enough of a gap between members of the group and belief in their health to know which of them would be good for the next year to three. So why jump out and go to the top of the market rather than wait, because who financially falls to you might be better anyway?</p>
      <p>Say you are interested in Marcell Ozuna. He is a good player. But his age-28 season last year was not all that different from the age-28 season last year of Avisail Garcia. I would expect Ozuna, because of his pedigree, would command, say, three or four years at $15 million-ish annually. Garcia perhaps maxes out at two years at $20 million, likely not even that much. In this age, though, many teams would just as soon take Garcia, mitigate the financial and length-of-contract risks and have more disposable cash to invest elsewhere to make up for any difference in skill between Ozuna and Garcia.</p>
      <p>But what about when there is not a legit approximation of a player? That is when you get to Smith and Grandal landing strong contracts so quickly this offseason.</p>
      <p>Drew Pomeranz is probably the next-best lefty reliever on the free-agent market. And based on his 25 regular-season games (24 in relief) after being obtained on July 31 by the Brewers, he was strikeout-machine great at it. But there is no track record of relief excellence.</p>
      <p>As recently as 2018, the Red Sox let Nathan Eovaldi pitch six innings of relief in World Series Game 3 rather than turn to Pomeranz. Maybe Pomeranz is ready to go on an extended run of relief excellence. I fully expect him to receive a strong contract on promise — like, say, the three-year, $25 million that the Dodgers bestowed Joe Kelly last offseason believing (wrongly it turns out) that he had harnessed his stuff following an impressive postseason.</p>
      <p>But there is way more projection going on there than exists with Smith — albeit in a job, reliever, with a ton of volatility.</p>
      <p>And most of the rest of the lefty-relief market are guys like Luis Avilan and Jerry Blevins — pretty much left-on-left relievers — when the rules in 2020 probably are going to be that a reliever has to face at least three batters unless an inning finishes before that.</p>
      <p>Because of that, the Braves were willing to sign a player given the qualifying offer — thus losing a draft pick and $500,000 in international pool money. Atlanta bestowed Smith a three-year, $40 million pact.</p>
      <p>The free-agent gap is even wider between Grandal and the next-best free-agent catcher — whether you pick Jason Castro, Robinson Chirinos, Travis d’Arnaud or Stephen Vogt, all of whom are more co-catchers than starters. None has the two-way excellence of Grandal. The White Sox want to upgrade their hitting and pitching this offseason, and no one player was going to help more in that forum than Grandal.</p>
      <p>In fact, catching overall is maybe the worst in history, so two-way guys performing at a high level such, as Grandal and Philadelphia’s J.T. Realmuto, provide a substantial advantage. That is why the White Sox gave Grandal $73 million over four years — the $18.25 million average per year the fourth-largest ever for a catcher.</p>
      <p>Remember that Grandal and the Mets moved close last offseason on a four-year, $60 million deal. Grandal ultimately gambled on himself, assuring he would be above the $17.9 million qualifying offer from the Dodgers that he rejected. He received just one year, but at $18.25 million, had a superb 2019 and now gets four more years at $18.25 million annually — so $91.25 million over five years in all.</p>
      <p>The gamble paid off because Grandal was distinct in this market.</p>
