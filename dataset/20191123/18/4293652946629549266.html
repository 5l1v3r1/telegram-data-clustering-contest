      <p>Ibaka and point guard Kyle Lowry are <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/raptors-kyle-lowry-serge-ibaka-nearing-return-injury/">close to returning</a> to action, with head coach Nick Nurse saying the team is “shooting for” a Dec. 1 return.</p>
      <p>Ibaka (ankle) and Lowry (thumb) have been out since Nov. 8 when they both picked up injuries against the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
      <p>The Raptors (10-4) are aiming for their third straight win after defeating the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets in their previous two matchups.</p>
