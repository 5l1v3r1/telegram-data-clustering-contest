      <p>Indian skipper Virat Kohli on Saturday became the first Indian cricketer to score a century in a pink-ball Test match. Kohli’s innings of 136 runs helped India post a comprehensive lead against Bangladesh at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens. He also went on to equal former Australian cricketer Ricky Ponting’s record of scoring the highest number of international centuries as a captain. Both Kohli and Ponting have scored 41 centuries each while captaining their respective sides.</p>

      <p>Kohli’s brilliant knock coupled with half-centuries by Chesteshwar Pujara (55) and Ajinkya Rahane (51) helped India post a formidable total of 347-9 (declared) in response to Bangladesh’s first innings total of 106 all out.</p>

      <p>For Bangladesh, Al-Amin Hossain and Ebadot Hossain took three wickets each, while Abu Jayed and Taijul Islam scalped two and one wickets respectively.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh’s second innings didn’t start on a positive note as the Tigers lost four top-order batsmen in quick succession. Reduced to 13-4, Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah gave stability to the Bangladeshi innings until Mahmudullah was retired hurt at 39. Rahim was batting at 59 when the second day’s play ended with Bangladesh reduced to 152-6.</p>
      <p>Ishant Sharma was once again unplayable in the second innings as he picked up four wickets. The remaining two went to Umesh Yadav. Earlier, Ishant had <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/sports/ishant-sharma-becomes-first-indian-bowler-to-claim-five-wickets-with-pink-ball-as-bangladesh-bundled-out-for-106-in-kolkata-test/273357/">become the first</a> Indian bowler to claim five-wickets in a pink-ball Test.</p>
