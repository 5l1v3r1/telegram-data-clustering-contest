      <h1>Optimal Systems pledges support towards Ghana’s digitisation agenda</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:14:45+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:14</time> by <a rel="author">Iddi Yire, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov. 23, GNA - Optimal Systems, a German Firm with the primary focus of developing digital software solutions, has pledged its support towards helping Ghana achieve its digitisation agenda.</p>
      <p>Mr Robert Ilse, Chief Executive Officer of Optimal Systems, noted that the company has a wide range of solutions including business management process/workflow, quality management, contract management and administration and digital project records/Project management.</p>
      <p>He said over 30 years of experience in software development, their role in Ghana’s digitisation effort would be to introduce an information management system, a solution that will help manage data effectively and efficiently.</p>
      <p>Mr Ilse made these remarks in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) on the sidelines of an Information Technology (IT) Seminar on Digitisation.</p>
      <p>It was organised by Optimal Systems in collaboration with Pacific Resources Limited, with an objective of introducing a world-class digitisation software to Ghana, thereby, giving participants the opportunity to better manage information and create a paperless system.</p>
      <p>It was attended by representatives from institutions and agencies such as the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation, Fanel Limited, National Health Insurance Authority, Environmental Agency, Enterprise Life, Airteltigo, and the Ghana Chamber of Telecommunications.</p>
      <p>The rest are Ghana Prison Service, Ghana Immigration Service, National Petroleum Authority, Lands Commission, West Blue, Preferred Consultancy, IA Consult, National Information Technology Agency (NITA), Sea Gate, and the Social Security and National Insurance Trust.</p>
      <p>Mr Ilse described its software as the framework for functional, innovative solutions which master the wide variety of challenges of enterprise content management, and could be precisely adapted to the requirements of their clients</p>
      <p>He said Optimal Systems was well positioned to change the status quo, thus, helping companies and governments to get processes digital to be able to more efficient, to go paperless, and also ensure information is safely stored.</p>
      <p>He said for instance, its ‘Enaio document management solution’ manages information and documents in a single platform; the range of functions includes context-related archiving, search tools, and connections to specialist applications.</p>
      <p>Mr James Kofi Kutsoati, Director at Pacific Resources Limited, a consulting firm, said  Optimal Systems had solutions that would complement Ghana’s effort of going paperless, which implied issues of files being sent to archives, looking for documents, would be a thing of the past.</p>
      <p>He expressed the hope that some participants whose needs were in line what was being presented would sign on, and Pacific Resources was well positioned to facilitate the process.</p>
      <p>Mr Kutsoati reiterated that the partnership with Optimal Systems aimed at collaborating towards Ghana’s digitization effort, and they were committed to promote the technology designed by Optimal Systems.</p>
      <p>“They have a track record, they are in IT for about 30 years, and their solutions are durable, effective, secured, and easy to access”, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Evans Sowah, a representative of NITA, in interview with the GNA commended the Management of Pacific Resources and Optimal Systems for exposing them to such solutions.</p>
      <p>He said considering the robustness of the system, it would help Ghana move faster towards the paperless system.</p>
