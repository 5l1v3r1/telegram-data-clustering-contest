      <p>In a dramatic encounter bit sides were reduced to ten men with the Glassboys also having manager Ian Long sent to the stand.</p>
      <p>It was the visitors who opened the scoring after just ten minutes when Anthony Dwyer sent a thundering effort past the City keeper.</p>
      <p>James Wren pulled off a good save to deny David Norris before a massed brawl led to the hosts having Mark Fell dismissed and the Stourbridge manager ordered from the dugout.</p>
      <p>Lancasterâ€™s equaliser came midway through the second half when Rob Wilson scored from the spot but the visitors regained the lead six minutes later when Aaron Birch stabbed the ball home from close range.</p>
      <p>Moments later Tom Turton saw red after picking up a second booking but the Glassboys held on helped by Matt Williams missing the target for the hosts deep in injury time.</p>
