      <p>Kim Kardashian has finally spoken out over Caitlyn Jenner's stint in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>Jenner’s daughters Kylie and Kendall are still ignoring I’m A Celeb as they fail to show support.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn is one of 12 campmates on the ITV1 reality show, which also features Ian Wright, James Haskell and Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>The star is being paid £500,000 to appear on the series, which is hosted by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.</p>
      <p>None of Caitlyn's family have publicly discussed or supported her during her time on the ITV show - until now.</p>
      <p>Kim Kardashian has shared a clip of the Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete, telling her 62.4m followers on Twitter: "I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago!" in response to a tweet from the official I'm A Celebirty...account.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn is captured waking up the rest of the camp and impersonates her daughter Kylie's viral 'Rise and Shine' video.</p>
      <p>One follower replied to Kim's post: "At last the whole of the uk were wondering if poor Caitlyn was going to have any family support. The uk love her in I’m a celeb" while another said: "We have all been waiting for a Kardashian tweet about #ImACelebrity2019".</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user replied with: "Finally you have tweeted about #ImACelebrity2019 we all have been waiting."</p>
