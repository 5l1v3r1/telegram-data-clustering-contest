      <p>The Walking Dead’s former hero <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chandler-riggs/">Chandler Riggs</a> has been rushed to hospital after he was thrown off the back of a horse.</p>
      <p>Don’t worry – he’s doing okay.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the 20-year-old’s mum, Gina-Ann Riggs, shared a picture of her bambino looking slightly worse for wear as he threw his thumb up towards the camera from a hospital bed.</p>
      <p>In the caption, the concerned parent updated fans, and wrote: ‘The call every mom hopes she never gets… Thankfully, he’s going to be ok and thankfully I’m here with him!</p>
      <p>‘He was thrown off of his horse yesterday afternoon. Thank GOODNESS he was wearing a helmet. He has a pretty bad concussion and is in a lot of pain but no broken bones!’</p>

      <p>‘Oh, and I had missed his episode so I stayed off of social media until I finally watched it this morning. Thank you for all of the kind words!!’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to comment and sent their well wishes to the Carl Grimes star.</p>

      <p>Someone else shared a string of heart emojis and said: ‘Feel better soon Chandler sending so much prayers and love.’</p>
      <p>Chandler played a huge role in The Walking Dead, as viewers watched him grow up on screen in the character Carl Grimes.</p>
      <p>But despite his tragic death, it seems the young <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/30/walking-deads-chandler-riggs-wants-carl-return-rick-grimes-movies-10657212/">actor is hoping to return to the role in the upcoming Rick Grimes movies.</a></p>
      <p>Earlier this year, he was asked by TVGuide if he’d want to make a comeback in the highly anticipated trilogy.</p>
      <p>And pleasing us no end, he confessed: ‘I hope so. That would be amazing. It’d be so much fun to get to work with Andy again. That’d be great.’</p>
