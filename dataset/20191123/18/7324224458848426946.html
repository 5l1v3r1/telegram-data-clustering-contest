      <p>With only one place between the Pitmen and the Ravens in the league, it promised to be a hard fought encounter.</p>
      <p>The visitors had the best of the opening exchanges with Andy Wycherley making a sharp save from Kalern Thomas.</p>
      <p>Luke Shaw should have opened the scoring for Coalville when he dragged his shot well wide.</p>
      <p>Danny Glover had a chance for the Pitmen after being set up by Tom Elliott, but his effort went straight to Saul Deeney.</p>
      <p>Ben Bailey went close at the far post from a corner before Andre Brown forced a smart save from Deeney as the hosts looked to capatilise on a good spell of pressure.</p>
      <p>On 44 minutes an advantage was played down the right with Glover crossing for. Jack Hallahan to head home at the far post to give the hosts a half term lead.</p>
      <p>Hednesford continued to dominate in the second half with Andre Brown forcing a save from Deeney with a fierce shot from 25 yards out.</p>
      <p>Ben O'Hanlon provided a deep cross from the left for Brown who had an effort blocked at the far post.</p>
      <p>This should have acted a warning to the visitors as an almost identical cross was headed home by skipper Ben Bailey to double Hednesford's lead.</p>
      <p>The Pitmen continued to control the game, retaining possession of the ball for long periods of play and limiting the Ravens' chances.</p>
      <p>A late flurry from Coalville did see Tin Berridge pull a goal back with a low drive into the centre of the goal in injury time.</p>
      <p>The Pitmen held on and will go into the draw for the next round on Monday</p>
