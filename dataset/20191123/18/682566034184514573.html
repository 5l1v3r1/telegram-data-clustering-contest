      <p>Cape Town -<b> Chris Gayle</b> hopes to finish off his<b> Mzansi Super League (MSL) 2.0 </b>and<b> Jozi Stars</b> stint with some fireworks when they take on neighbours, <b>Tshwane Spartans</b>, at Wanderers Stadium tomorrow afternoon.</p>
      <p>Stars, the defending champions from last year, have lost all five of their matches so far as they head to a match that can help them maintain their mathematical chances of a spot in the knockout stages.</p>
      <p>Gayle, the West Indies legend nicknamed the “Universe Boss”, will be playing his final match before returning to the Caribbean islands on Monday.</p>
      <p>“I love coming to South Africa, though at the moment it has been disappointing, losing five games on the trot as defending champions. On a personal note, it has been hard not getting the runs we wanted and to give the fans something to cheer about,” said the 40-year-old master blaster batsman.</p>
      <p>“Life does have its ups and downs. We still have five games and we are going to be giving ourselves a chance back at home on Sunday. We’ve got to keep our heads up and see what the next games have got to offer.</p>
      <p>“You never know, some strange things have happened in this form of cricket, this is one of those moments where you have to be strong as individuals.”</p>
      <p>Gayle has great memories of Mzansi – on and off the field – dating back to 1998, as a teen where he was the leading run scorer in the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup tournament. That was the spark to a two-decade long journey in international cricket in the maroon Windies colours. </p>
      <p>“From a personal point of view, I always enjoyed coming to South Africa. I love this country so much. I started here 21 years ago when I was playing for the Under-19s. Separate from the recent results, I still get a lot of love here. I want to say thanks for all of the support over the years. I may have not gotten the runs, but still get a lot of good reception and love from the fans,” said Gayle.</p>
      <p>“There are also so many things to see in Johannesburg and Cape Town...when I am free, I get a chance to visit Sun City (in the North West Province), go to the bush on a Safari, which has been good. I will always look to keep coming here and look to invite friends and family to South Africa where I can showcase what I have experienced over the years.”  </p>
