      <p>On Nov. 23, 1984, Boston College quarterback Doug Flutie pulled off the "Miracle in Miami," throwing a Hail Mary touchdown pass that defeated the University of Miami 47-45 at the muddy Orange Bowl.</p>
      <p>With six seconds remaining, the Boston College quarterback took a snap near midfield, scrambled to his right and heaved a pass toward the end zone. </p>
      <p>Forty-eight yards downfield, Gerard Phelan outjumped the coverage and came up with the pass, snaring the ball despite four defenders in the end zone as Boston College defeated the defending national champions.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know Phelan was behind us,” Miami freshman safety Darrell Fullington told <a href="http://tenweeksofsummer.blogspot.com/2010/08/great-moments-in-american-sports-doug.html">ESPN</a> after the game. “I took my eye away from him for just one second to see where Flutie was, and it was too late. I looked back, and the ball was in the air, and Phelan was past me. I jumped as hard as I could, but ...”</p>
      <p>The pass helped Flutie win the Heisman Trophy in 1984.</p>
      <p>“It was a matter of who had the ball last, and with 28 seconds I thought if we could get it to the 50-yard line we’d have a 50-50 chance at a touchdown,” Flutie told the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/college/acc/university-of-miami/article237674824.html">Miami Herald</a> after the game. “It’s a real shot in the dark, but stranger things have happened.”</p>
      <p>Flutie passed for 472 yards and three touchdowns, including his miracle toss.</p>
