      <h1>Photo: Ohio State Fan’s Sign For Joe Burrow Is Going Viral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:25:23+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday morning, ESPN’s College GameDay broadcast from Columbus ahead of a huge match-up between Ohio State and Penn State.</p>
      <p>Each and every Saturday, fans bring their best signs to College GameDay. Every now and then one sign takes the cake and goes viral on social media.</p>
      <p>Today, that sign came from an Ohio State fan who had a message for former Buckeyes quarterback Joe Burrow. Ohio State fans are looking forward to seeing Burrow in the College Football Playoff – assuming both teams make it there.</p>
      <p>Except the fan used the wrong stadium – they pictured the Atlanta Falcons stadium instead of the New Orleans Saints stadium.</p>
      <p>Oops.</p>

      <p>Burrow transferred to LSU after losing the starting job to Justin Fields at Ohio State. It’s worked out for both quarterbacks, who are in the Heisman Trophy conversation for College Football Playoff caliber teams.</p>
      <p>LSU and Ohio State are both the favorites to win their respective conference. If that happens they will be the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the country and wouldn’t face each other until the title game.</p>
      <p>Will we see Burrow against his former team in the College Football Playoff national title game?</p>
