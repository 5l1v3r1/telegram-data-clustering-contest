      <h1>"Base" Porsche Taycan 4S Shines In Los Angeles</h1>
      <h2>A lovely shade of Frozen Blue Metallic certainly helps.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T18:10:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Porsche's maiden all-electric model, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan">Taycan</a>, arrived in its most expensive guises - the Turbo and Turbo S. With 670 and 750 horsepower, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/presenting-the-2020-porsche-taycan-turbo-and-turbo-s">Taycan Turbo and Turbo S</a> can hit 60 mph in 3.0 and 2.6 seconds respectively. Last month, Porsche introduced the least expensive member of the Taycan family, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/base-porsche-taycan-has-more-power-than-a-911-gt3">the 4S</a>, which still boasts 563 hp with an overboost function yielding a 0-60 mph time of just 3.8 seconds.</p>
      <p>At the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, Porsche revealed the 2020 Taycan 4S, giving us the chance to check it out in the metal.</p>

      <p>The example under the show lights is finished in a lovely color called Frozen Blue Metallic. Wearing options like 21-inch Taycan Exclusive Design Wheels with Carbon Fiber Aeroblades for $8,770, this particular Taycan would carry a pretty high sticker price. The wheels look great but if it was our money, we'd opt for the 21-inch Mission E Design Wheels available for a more reasonable $4,680.</p>
      <p>Inside, the Taycan holds a major advantage over its chief competitor, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-s">Tesla Model S</a>. Whereas Tesla's cabin feels somewhat spartan, the Taycan's interior feels like it came from the future. The driver looks at a beautiful piece of curved glass, which houses the digital gauge cluster. All of the controls are housed on touchscreens and the passenger even gets their own screen to control various functions of the car. The cloth seats on this particular model felt remarkably upscale and are an impressive alternative to leather.</p>

      <p>This might be the "entry-level Taycan," but at $103,800 it's not exactly cheap. Opting for the larger Performance battery Plus model bumps the price to $110,380 while increasing the range from 253 to 288 miles, giving the 4S the longest range available in the Taycan range. If you can live without the blistering performance of the Turbo and Turbo S, we think the 4S is the Taycan to get.</p>
