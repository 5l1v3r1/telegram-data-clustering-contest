      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g19599018/kate-middleton-most-controversial-moments/">Kate Middleton</a> just rewore one of her most amazing ensembles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g25618117/kate-middleton-style-before-royalty/">Duchess of Cambridge</a> sported her customized, green Beulah London ‘Yahvi’ dress during a reception she and her husband, Prince William, hosted for nominees and finalists for the Tusk Conservation Awards on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>"Earlier today, Catherine and I spent some time with the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TuskAwards?src=hashtag_click">#TuskAwards</a> nominees and finalists. Their bravery, single-minded determination, and commitment to African conservation is deeply deeply humbling," William wrote of the low-key reception in a post on the official <a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1197632859818938368">Kensington Palace Twitter</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29046344/kate-middleton-fashion-style-6-dollar-earrings/">Kate's dress</a> is one we've seen before. She wore the show-stopping dress in January of this year during a visit to Family Action—a charity focused on working directly with vulnerable children and families through more than 135 community-based services—to launch a new national support line in Lewisham, England.</p>

      <p>The green Beulah dress was customized for the duchess (he version doesn't have fluted cuffs and features ruched shoulder detailing). The fitted dress has a flowing, midi-length skirt and gorgeous button detailing. It's still available to shop, if you feel like splurging (it costs almost $700):</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a29243113/kate-middleton-new-asprey-clutch-birkenhead/">Kate paired</a> the dress with her Gianvito Rossi 85 heels in dark olive suede (which also retail for just shy of $700):</p>
