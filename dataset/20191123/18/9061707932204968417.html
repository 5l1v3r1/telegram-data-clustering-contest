      <p>This prolific Derby criminal smeared his face with his own faeces after being arrested for his latest series of offences.</p>
      <p>Derby Crown Court hear how Scott Liddall carried out the dirty protest after persistently being found in parts of the city centre he was banned from entering.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was handed the order after being convicted of stealing bikes around the city.</p>
      <p>On one occasion he was filmed being chased on two wheels from Midland Railway Station by a policeman on a bicycle.</p>
      <p>Now Liddall, who has 20 previous convictions for 89 offences, has been jailed for a total of 62 weeks for a raft of offences.</p>
      <h3>'A degree of notoriety'</h3>
      <p>Stuart Lody, prosecuting, said: “He is 39 years of age and he has an appalling record.</p>
      <p>“He is one of the most prolific bike thieves in the city of Derby who has achieved a degree of notoriety over the years as a result of his criminal record.</p>
      <p>“When he was arrested and the police attempted to interview him, instead of providing an explanation or simply exercising his legal right to refuse to answer questions, what he did was to smear his face with his own faeces in order to avoid being taken into the interview room.”</p>

      <p>In September 2018, police released a video of Liddall, then of Sidney Street.</p>
      <p>It showed him being approached by an officer on a bicycle at the Pride park entrance to Midland Railway Station.</p>
      <p>Liddall, now of no fixed address, fled on the bike down a footpath alongside the River Derwent before he was caught and stopped close to Bass’s Rec, next to Station Approach.</p>
      <p>On that occasion Liddall was jailed for 36 weeks and handed a criminal behaviour order.</p>
      <h3>Not allowed to touch a bike</h3>
      <p>Under its terms he was not even allowed to touch a bike for three years and was banned from entering certain parts of the city centre.</p>
      <p>But Mr Lody told the new hearing how he has breached that on three occasions in August and September of this year by being found in the city.</p>
      <p>And, on a separate occasion, he was also found to be in possession of a bike.</p>
      <p>Following the dirty protest Liddall pleaded guilty to breaching the order.</p>
      <p>Jailing him, Recorder Charles Falk said: “You have a horrific and prolific criminal record.</p>
      <p>“That order was put in place and you are well aware of its terms, you know exactly where you can and cannot go.”</p>
      <p>Ben Brown, for Liddall, said his client has been homeless since being released from his last prison sentence and has been sleeping in doorways.</p>
      <p>He said: “He struggles with his drug use and he struggles with his mental health.</p>
      <p>“These are not serious breaches, he did not cause serious harm or distress to anyone and he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.”</p>
