      <p>The Bees racked up a fifth win from their last six matches and dealt Royals boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mark-bowen/"><b>Mark Bowen</b></a> a first defeat since he took charge last month.</p>
      <p>Watkins' well-taken header was his 11th goal of the campaign and, if he stays in this sort of form, Brentford could yet mark their final season at Griffin Park with a genuine promotion push.</p>
      <p>Reading, unbeaten in their previous four outings, almost gifted the hosts an early lead when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-morrison/"><b>Michael Morrison</b></a>'s back-pass sold keeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rafael-cabral/"><b>Rafael Cabral</b></a> short.</p>
      <p>Watkins dived in to block Rafael's clearance and the ball cannoned back off the striker only to bounce inches wide.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rico-henry/"><b>Rico Henry</b></a>, who needed lengthy treatment for an elbow in the mouth early on, then raided down the left and pulled the ball back for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/said-benrahma/"><b>Said Benrahma</b></a>, who skewed his shot wide.</p>
      <p>Henry got in again after referee <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-coote/"><b>David Coote</b></a> played an advantage following a foul on Watkins, but his angled drive was blocked by Rafael.</p>
      <p>But Reading had the best chance of the first period on the half-hour mark when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/george-puscas/"><b>George Puscas</b></a> burst through on goal.</p>
      <p>The Romanian forward opted to go round <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-raya/"><b>David Raya</b></a> rather than shoot and the Bees keeper got down well to make the save.</p>
      <p>As half-time approached, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bryan-mbeumo/"><b>Bryan Mbeumo</b></a>'s deflected drive from the edge of the box was tipped round the past by Rafael.</p>
      <p>After the break Henry scampered clear down the left again and crossed for Watkins, who missed his kick in front of goal.</p>
      <p>But the breakthrough came on the hour with that man Henry in the thick of it again.</p>
      <p>The full-back laid the ball off to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mathias-jensen/"><b>Mathias Jensen</b></a>, who curled in an inviting cross which Watkins emphatically headed back across Rafael and inside the far post.</p>
      <p>Watkins was denied a second moments later when Rafael somehow kept him at bay two yards out following a goalmouth scramble.</p>
      <p>Reading chased an equaliser but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ovie-ejaria/"><b>Ovie Ejaria</b></a> blazed over and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andy-yiadom/"><b>Andy Yiadom</b></a> fired agonisingly wide as Brentford marched on.</p>
