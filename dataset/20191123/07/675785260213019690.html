      <h2>'Sexy Samaritan' Ellen, 24, from Brighton, started pole dancing and giving lap dances at a strip club for some extra cash - and loves it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:16:54+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:16</time> by <a rel="author">Amber Hicks, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A student nurse who strips on weekends to fund her studies has revealed how she can make up to £2,500 a night – but most men just want a chat.</p>
      <p>Ellen, whose stripper name and alter ego is ‘Bunny’, says she is more like a ‘Sexy Samaritan’ as a lot of punters treat her private lap dances as a therapy session.</p>
      <p>She also met the love of her life, Si, while pole dancing at a strip club and is now a happily married stepmother-of-two.</p>
      <p>The Botox-loving 24-year-old, who has had a boob job, lip filler and and wants her nose done, began her pole dancing career when she moved to Brighton to train to become a nurse.</p>
      <p>She was encouraged by her mum to look into getting paid to get her kit off after she heard on the radio how medical students were stripping for extra cash.</p>

      <p>And Ellen says she gets treated better at the strip club than when she’s working in a hospital.</p>
      <p>“I did want to help people. I’m from a family of nurses, but the reality is, it’s really hard and it is tiring,” she told BBC documentary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p07l6ffm/girls-on-girls-series-1-1-ellen">Girls on Girls</a> .</p>
      <p>“It was also a new situation [moving to Brighton], I didn’t know anyone. I had no family here, no friends – I was really on my own.</p>

      <p>"It was only through dancing I have met all my friends which has really changed my life.”</p>
      <p>Ellen pays a house fee to perform at a strip club where the women take it in turns to dance on a pole.</p>
      <p>They perform to two songs; one in their underwear and one topless. However they are only paid for private lap dances.</p>

      <p>“When we’re not on the stage, we’ll be walking around the floor, talking to customers and trying to get them into private lap dances, where we get fully naked,” Ellen explained.</p>
      <p>“And that’s how we make our money. More often than not, I’m getting paid £400, £500 to sit with someone and just chat to them. We are like expensive counsellors, it’s brilliant.”</p>
      <p>Ellen, who admits she ‘gets a lot of stick’, added: “People think that we are s****, we’ve got STIs and we sleep with people’s husbands and this is a last resort, but that is not the case at all.</p>

      <p>“We are doing this because we want money like any other job.”</p>
      <p>She also doesn’t mind baring her body to strangers as “at the end of the night, I’m going home to my husband."</p>
      <p>She continued: “People may not see me as a feminist because I’m a stripper, but we are just trying to better our lives. We are not s***s, we are not doing anything wrong.”</p>

      <p>Ellen will only stop dancing when she’s ready and no one will influence her decision - not even husband Si.</p>
      <p>“I trust her 100 per cent,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I met her doing it so I couldn’t really turn around and judge her or tell her to stop doing it.”</p>
      <p>For now, Ellen “absolutely loves it" and the confidence it gives her.</p>
      <p>"And I’m going to be able to save, whereas if I was just a nurse I would not be able to do that,” she added.</p>
