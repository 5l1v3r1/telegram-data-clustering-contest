      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Ramage</a></address>
      <p>St Mirren striker Jon Obika grew up in London in the shadow of his boyhood club’s stadium.</p>
      <p>Little did he know as a Spurs-supporting kid he would one day be starting in front of a sold-out White Hart Lane in a crunch UEFA Cup tie while still just 19-years-old.</p>
      <p>And despite going on several loan spells from the London giants, the affable 29-year-old will never forget the London roots that gave him his pathway into football.</p>
      <p>“I grew up around Tottenham in Edmonton. That’s where I’d call my hometown,” the confident forward told Express Sport.</p>
      <p>“I supported <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> as a kid. I almost started supporting Man United, but then when I signed for Tottenham I really had to support them!</p>
      <p>“In terms of experience I didn’t have much, like Sunday league football or anything like that. My parents were just always about education, education.</p>
      <p>“I was thankful that I got spotted and picked up. Our school was near the Tottenham stadium and every year six pupils were selected to go and get some training from the club’s development coaches.</p>
      <p>“They picked up two of us from there and I was delighted to get that opportunity.</p>

      <p>“I made my debut in Europe against NEC Nijmegen in Holland off the bench and then made my full debut at White Hart Lane against Shahktar Donetsk.</p>
      <p>“To go from school football to that in a short space of time was just incredible.</p>
      <p>“It was really weird, for some reason I just wasn’t nervous on my debut. It was more of an excitement. There were so many youngsters there and we all just wanted to get our chance. So when we got it it was more of an excitement feeling because you didn’t have time to think about anything else.</p>
      <p>“I found out on the day that I was playing so I really just felt like ‘come on, let’s do this’.</p>
      <p>Despite being just a teenager at the time and coming through the youth ranks alongside Harry Kane, Obika was tasked by then manager Harry Redknapp to lead the line against Ukraine giants Shahktar Donetsk as they looked to progress into the last-16 of the UEFA Cup.</p>
      <p>After losing the first leg 2-0, Spurs went on to draw 1-1 in front of a packed stadium. It was that match that opened Obika’s eyes to the level of the greatest players, as he lined up alongside now Real Madrid and Wales star <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/gareth-bale">Gareth Bale</a>.</p>
      <p>Obika said: “It was a massive game for the club. We had to win to get through but drew 1-1.</p>
      <p>“I just remember the crowd was amazing. It was a packed house.</p>
      <p>“In terms of atmosphere it was definitely the biggest game of my career. You just have to go back and think about it and it’s surreal.</p>
      <p>“We had Gareth Bale, Luka Modric, Jermaine Defoe, Dimitar Berbatov. There were some big, big players around Spurs at that point.</p>
      <p>“You knew the gap as a youngster because even though we used to win a lot of youth tournaments, you could see the difference because their basic skills were just on another level. They never did anything wrong.</p>
      <p>“I remember watching Bale over a two-year period where he was just scoring every game. He was so explosive and that’s when we started to think he was incredible and destined for the top.”</p>
      <p>Despite being involved in the Spurs senior squad, Obika found himself sent out on loan several times in his early career. That included spells at Yeovil Town, Millwall, Crystal Palace and Swindon Town.</p>
      <p>And while he wishes he had managed more games at White Hart Lane, he feels playing for other clubs helped him develop as a player and as a man.</p>
      <p>He said: “My first loan was for Yeovil. Myself and Andros Townsend went there.</p>
      <p>“We were both really healthy eaters so we always used to eat the salads and the pastas because that was the discipline drilled into us at the academy.</p>
      <p>“We got put into a hotel and all the food was just fried. I remember Andros snuck in an electric stove so we cook inside our rooms. I don’t think it was good for health and safety but it helped us a lot!</p>

      <p>“It was tough to settle there but it made you grow up a bit quicker. We learned about life there.</p>
      <p>“I did enjoy it there because we were bottom of the league and we had ten games left needing maximum points.</p>
      <p>“We were able to come out of that which was a big feat. It felt like we were in proper men’s football.”</p>
      <p>Obika eventually moved away from Tottenham in 2014 when he signed a permanent deal at Swindon Town.</p>
      <p>And he admits the stability of a long-term contract helped him settle down and focus on matters on the pitch.</p>
      <p>He explained: “The first time I was really settled was at Swindon. When I was around 23 I stepped away from Tottenham and got a three-year contract there, which helped me relax and focus on the football.</p>
      <p>“It meant I could look to the future with the club. We had goals to go up the leagues and there was always ambition to look ahead, not just at the current campaign.</p>
      <p>“I’ve only just started to look back on the play-off final I lost with Swindon because I didn’t even want to remember it. There was a lot of anger towards that game because we just didn’t perform.</p>
      <p>“Looking back though it will help because the next time I’m in a final, or going into a big game, you just have to learn from it and give it your all the next time.”</p>
      <p>Obika has bagged two goals for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> since joining on a two-year deal in the summer, his first a spectacular overhead kick at the Simple Digital Arena.</p>
      <p>And now he is fully focused on performing for the Buddies, and is convinced the similarities he sees between former boss Redknapp and current boss Jim Goodwin will help him shine in Paisley.</p>

      <p>He added: “From the first time I met the manager here I knew he was someone you could go and speak to a lot.</p>
      <p>“He’s very clear on his tactics which is very good for me. I just want to go out in every game and know exactly what is required of me.</p>
      <p>“Harry Redknapp on gameday tactically was so sharp. It was him, myself, Kevin Bond and Joe Jordan talking before games and they had a good connection.</p>
      <p>“I feel my role is to bring people in and also get in behind and score goals.</p>
      <p>“I need to bring everyone into play when I’m leading the line. But the gaffer also wants me to express myself. He wants me to run at players and try things.</p>
      <p>“That makes me feel comfortable going into every game.”</p>
