      <p>Reacting to the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/devendra-fadnavis-takes-oath-as-maharashtra-chief-minister-ncps-ajit-pawar-as-his-deputy-shiv-sena-congress-6132825/"><b>sudden twist in government formation in Maharashtra</b></a>, senior Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi Saturday said he thought the developments were “fake news”, but blamed the duration of negotiations between his party, NCP and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a>.</p>
      <p>“Candidly and personally speaking, our tripartite negotiations should not have gone on for more than 3 days… took too long. Window given was grabbed by fast movers. Pawarji tussi grt ho!” he tweeted this morning.</p>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis</a> was sworn in as Maharashtra Chief Minister for a second time and <b><a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/who-is-ajit-pawar-ncp-maharashtra-deputy-cm-6132876/">NCP leader Ajit Pawar</a> </b>as his deputy on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar said Ajit’s decision to join hands with the Fadnavis was personal. “Ajit Pawar’s decision to support the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> to form the Maharashtra government is his personal decision and not that of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nationalist-congress-party-ncp/">Nationalist Congress Party</a> (NCP). we place on record that we do not support or endorse this decision of his,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar had on Thursday night said there was a consensus among the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena that Uddhav Thackeray should lead the new government. A formal announcement on government formation and the power-sharing agreement between the three parties was awaited amid indications of a tussle between the Congress and NCP for the Assembly Speaker’s post.</p>
