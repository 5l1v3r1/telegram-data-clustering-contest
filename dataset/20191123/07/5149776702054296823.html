      <h1>Albert Adomah plotting another 'great' Nottingham Forest away performance on familiar territory</h1>
      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's Reds can put clear daylight between themselves at the Robins with a win at Ashton Gate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Albert Adomah is plotting a successful return to Bristol this weekend as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> look to steal a march on their play-off rivals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/albert-adomah">The ex-Bristol City star</a> spent three years at Ashton Gate earlier in his career, racking up more than a century of appearances, and returning to his old club is a challenge he is looking forward to, as long as his team continue their 'great' form away from the City Ground.</p>
      <p>City and Forest are <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-what-nottingham-3566446">locked together on 28 points in the Championship table</a>, with only goal difference separating the two clubs occupying the final two play-off berths.</p>
      <p>“Bristol City will be a tough challenge as they are doing well. We are on the same points so we have to be careful; there are <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/worries-lot-how-bristol-city-3566046">no easy games in the Championship</a>,” said winger Adomah.</p>
      <p>“We are in the top five at the moment and we can do well.”</p>

      <p>The two clubs were winners in big games before the international break, as Forest saw off Derby County and City won at Cardff.</p>
      <p>That was the Reds’ fourth home win in the league this term, but it’s their away form which has really impressed.</p>
      <p>Sabri Lamouchi has already masterminded wins at Fulham, Swansea, Stoke and Luton, and a fifth win at Ashton Gate would see the Reds notch more victories on the road than they did in the entirely of last term.</p>
      <p>“Our home and away performances have been great so I am sure if we do what we do best, we can beat them,” continued the 31-year-old.</p>

      <p>“<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-nottingham-forest-grabban-3564739">Bristol City are always up there</a> and they have a youthful team. Hopefully we can turn up and show them the challenges.</p>
      <p>“I had a great three seasons there and I was appreciated by the supporters, the downside was obviously getting relegated with them but it is a tremendous club.</p>
      <p>“Every time I have played against them I have had a good reception, it is a team that took to me and when I have played against them we have won or drawn so hopefully we can get the win.”</p>
