      <p>Colombian President Ivan Duque has ordered a curfew in the nation’s capital amid continuing unrest following a massive march.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands took to the streets a day earlier to send a strong message of rejection against Mr Duque’s conservative government.</p>
      <p>The president announced on Twitter that he has requested that Bogota’s mayor enforces a curfew beginning at 9pm in all of the city of 7 million after police pushed back thick crowds of protesters banging pots and pans in the storied Plaza Bolivar.</p>

      <p>While the protest started out peaceful, it ended with scattered clashes between protesters and police. Three people were killed in what authorities described as violent looting incidents overnight.</p>
      <p>Clashes continued in parts of Bogota and in the south-western city of Cali on Friday as volunteers wiped graffiti off historic buildings and swept up shattered glass.</p>
      <p>The upheaval comes as Latin America is experiencing a tide of discontent, with massive demonstrations in countries including Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador where citizens frustrated with their political leaders are taking to the streets.</p>

      <p>The minister said two individuals were killed in the port city of Buenaventura after police were attacked while responding to looting at a shopping centre. A third died in Candelaria after police said a group looting a supermarket shot at officers.</p>
      <p>The names and cause of death of those killed were not released.</p>
      <p>Mr Duque called a special meeting with his ministers on Friday but did not immediately respond to protesters’ demand for a meeting. In an address after the protest, the president said he had heard the day’s outcry and supported talks with all sectors.</p>
      <p>Protest organisers urged Mr Duque to establish a dialogue with indigenous, student and labour groups to discuss potential reforms and criticised him for not directly addressing demonstrator complaints in a late-night address.</p>
      <p>Recent polling indicates Mr Duque has a 26% approval rating 15 months into his administration as the nation grapples with implementing a complicated peace process with leftist rebels, ongoing violence between illegal armed groups and long-simmering tensions over issues like corruption and inequality.</p>
