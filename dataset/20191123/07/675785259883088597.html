      <h1>How Jose Mourinho fared in his first games in charge of previous clubs</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese will take charge of Tottenham for the first time since replacing Mauricio Pochettino when they go to West Ham in Saturday's early kick-off</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Guess who's back? Back again.</p>
      <p>You can't have missed the news the week, as Jose Mourinho makes his first return to Premier League football following his sacking by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> in December last year.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has replaced Mauricio Pochettino in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur hotseat following the Argentinean's somewhat surprise departure on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>And as the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and United boss returns to the English top-flight in a London derby at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> in Saturday's early kick-off, we thought we'd take a look back at how he fared in his first games in charge of his previous clubs.</p>
      <p>As you'd expect, they've been pretty eventful.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Benfica</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Boavista 1-0 Benfica - September 23, 2000</b>

      <p>The Lisbon giants somewhat surprisingly turned to assistant Mourinho to replace German boss Jupp Heynckes in 2000, giving the 37-year-old his first job as a No.1.</p>
      <p>He got off to an inauspicious start though, losing to an early Duda goal as his future Chelsea midfielder Maniche was sent off.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Leiria</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Leiria 2-2 Santa Clara - August 19, 2001</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>He was to last just three months at Benfica though, before returning the following season with unfashionable Leiria.</p>
      <p>They would start the 2001/02 campaign with a draw at home to Santa Clara, before eventually finishing seventh in the league despite Mourinho leaving halfway through the season.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Porto</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Porto 2-1 Maritimo - January 26, 2002</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>He caught the eye of Porto after impressing at Leiria, and began with a win after replacing Octavio Machado in the hotseat.</p>
      <p>Soon-to-be Tottenham flop Helder Postiga grabbed the winner in a 2-1 success.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Chelsea (first spell)</u>
      </h3>

      <p>After anointing himself as 'The Special One' Mourinho arrived in England with a bang as Chelsea served notice to Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United and the rest of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>It took Eidur Gudjohnsen just 14 minutes to grab the game's only goal.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Inter Milan</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Inter Milan 2-2 Roma (won 6-5 on penalties) - August 24, 2008</b>

      <p>Mario Balotelli was on target as Mourinho began life in Italy by picking up the Italian Super Cup on penalties in Milan.</p>
      <p>A week later he'd make his Serie A bow, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic striking in a 1-1 draw at Sampdoria.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Real Madrid</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Mallorca 0-0 Real Madrid - August 29, 2010</b>

      </figure>
      <p>The Portuguese had to settle for a point on his La Liga debut at Mallorca, who ground out a goalless draw.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's Madrid would go on to win 29 of the following 37 league games, but they missed out on the title to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> by four points.</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Chelsea (second spell)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Chelsea 2-0 Hull City - August 18, 2013</b>

      <p>Oscar and Frank Lampard were the goal heroes as Mourinho came back to Chelsea with a victory in 2013, when he was feted like a returning hero.</p>
      <p>The Blues would go on to finish third that season behind <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> .</p>
      <h3>
        <u>Manchester United</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Manchester United 2-1 Leicester - August 7, 2016</b>
      </p>

        <figcaption>Mourinho opened up for United at Wembley (Image: Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Mourinho was walking into the reigning FA Cup holders when he joined Manchester United in 2016, and one of his summer signings proved the difference against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> in the Community Shield.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic grabbed the winner with seven minutes remaining, with the Swede also scoring a week later as United beat <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> 3-1 in the Premier League.</p>
