      <h1>Menayese, Upson, Nichols: Bristol Rovers' expected team to face Shrewsbury Town</h1>
      <h2>The Gas are back in League One action</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>As much of a slog Tuesday night's encounter was at Bromley, for players, management, fans and neutral viewers alike, it achieved several vital aims for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a>.</p>
      <p>First and foremost was the victory over the National League side, in testing conditions, for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-january-transfer-window-3557778">safe passage into the second round</a> of the FA Cup which also extended the Gas' mini unbeaten run to five matches.</p>
      <p>Secondly, was the fact Jonson Clarke-Harris and Ollie Clarke emerged unscathed from the encounter as they continue their ascent to full fitness.</p>
      <p>Then there was the need for competitive football as last Saturday's postponed fixture against Sunderland due to international call-ups created a gap in the fixtures, one which Graham Coughlan didn't exactly relish previously with the cancelled game against Bury in early October.</p>
      <p>As a result of all that, Rovers travel to New Meadow in some form - certainly in terms of results - and with key players available and looking sharper. Here is how we think Rovers will line up ...</p>
      <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
      <p>It's tough to take for Jordi van Stappershoef but having stepped in for Anssi Jaakkola while he was away with Finland - who have qualified for Euro 2020 - <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-rovers-coach-injuries-menayeses-3567016">the Dutchman is likely to make way</a>, despite keeping back-to-back clean sheets.</p>
      <p>The dynamic at Rovers is that Jaakkola is No1 and Van Stappershoef his deputy, something goalkeepers are used to and until the Finn suffers a massive dip in form or injury, will remain.</p>
      <p>It's a great position for the club to be in: Jaakkola in tremendous form and among the most consistent keepers in the league while in the background the younger Van Stappershoef is building his experience and knowhow of English football.</p>

      <h3>Defence</h3>
      <p>Based on Graham Coughlan's comments at the start of the week and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-rovers-coach-injuries-menayeses-3567016">Joe Dunne providing further clarification</a> on Friday, Tom Davies isn't quite ready in terms of recovering from his knee injury.</p>
      <p>Tony Craig and Alfie Kilgour pick themselves which leaves one spot open, if Coughlan wants to start a back three.</p>
      <p>Given <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/shrewsbury-town-finding-momentum-demanding-3562997">Shrewsbury play a 3-4-3</a>, numbers dictate the Gas' 3-5-2 might be the best way to go in terms of matching them up.</p>
      <p>That's what he fielded against Bromley and Swindon in the EFL Trophy but in the previous two fixtures - the first game against Bromley and at Rochdale - the Gas had switched to a more conventional back four.</p>
      <p>Coughlan admitted that change in late October was a product of opposition teams figuring out his side out and what is especially pleasing now is the manager has options.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When Davies comes back that presents a real dilemma but <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-january-transfer-window-3557778">Rollin Menayese's performance at Hayes Lane</a> on Tuesday has certainly given him food for thought and, based on that display, maybe it's time to give the 21-year-old his first League One start.</p>
      <p>If that's seen as too much of a gamble, then Mark Little will be on the right side of the three. But the 31-year-old has that extra defensive security as a right wing-back, compared to the more offensive Alex Rodman, which is surely a consideration with Shrewsbury's width.</p>
      <p>On the left, Tareiq Holmes-Dennis is in contention and turning that area of the field into a three-way fight between him, Luke Leahy and Michael Kelly.</p>
      <p>But Leahy is the man in possession of the jersey and after this unit kept a clean sheet against Bromley, there doesn't seem to be a huge reason to change it.</p>
      <h3>Midfield</h3>
      <p>One alarming aspect of Rovers play against Bromley was their inability to keep the ball and dictate possession.</p>
      <p>There are mitigating circumstances considering the surface they were playing on and maybe it was part of Coughlan's gameplan - to invite the hosts onto them and then attack on the break, knowing the National League side wouldn't be as comfortable on the ball as a League One team.</p>
      <p>One thing's for sure, if they do adopt that tactic or fall into it against Shrewsbury, they'll likely be punished so they have to take greater care of the ball.</p>
      <p>Rovers best individual for retaining <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graham-coughlan-eager-see-bristol-3556987">any sense of control in midfield</a> is unquestionably Ed Upson who was a surprising omission from the starting XI against Bromley but could be one of the individuals who Joe Dunne was talking about in terms of those who have played through injury of late.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3496895.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JMP_Rochdale_v_Bristol_Rovers_JP_030.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The Gas simply play better when Upson is purring in the engine room with his passing and unless he is carrying a semi-serious injury, he should come back into the XI alongside Abu Ogogo, who's a must given his destructive play at the base of midfield.</p>
      <p>That then creates a choice for the manager between Ollie Clarke and Liam Sercombe. The captain has played with greater freedom in recent weeks - completing 90 minutes against Rochdale, Swindon and Bromley - but after recovering from a hamstring strain, a second game inside five days might be too much to bear, so Sercombe as starter could make more sense.</p>
      <p>This is all on the assumption Coughlan will play a three-man central midfield unit, for if he switches to a four that then brings Rodman into the conversation on the right and/or even Leahy on the left with Kelly or Holmes-Dennis tucked in behind.</p>
      <h3>Attack</h3>
      <p>Unless there were any complications with his calf post-Bromley, and neither he nor Dunne implied so on Friday, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-top-five-most-3559523">Jonson Clarke-Harris will lead the line</a> for Rovers and, once again, be their primary goal threat.</p>
      <p>As to who lines up alongside him, well that's a different matter altogether.</p>
      <p>Coughlan has rotated based on a variety of factors: form, performances in training, the relative strengths and weaknesses of the opponents on the day, even simple gut feeling.</p>
      <p>During Clarke-Harris departure, the only one of Rovers' other three forwards to produce anything near to any consistency was Victor Adeboyejo and even that was with some reservation.</p>
      <p>The issue with the Barnsley forward is that he doesn't really mesh with Clarke-Harris - they are two similar in their hold-up player and both function better with a smaller, nimbler runner of them.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>That's when Tyler Smith and Tom Nichols become the most viable options but neither, as we know, is playing well enough to definitively own the shirt.</p>
      <p>Smith has had patches where he's looked an excellent talent but has been curiously quiet in recent weeks and Nichols is burdened by a lack of confidence.</p>
      <p>That being said, if Clarke-Harris could pick the team he would unquestionably select Nichols for his tireless running and work off the ball, plus the two have a more developed understanding and chemistry than Smith or Adeboyejo with the Rovers No9.</p>
      <p>To that end, with Clarke-Harris approaching full fitness - or his own version of that concept - Coughlan may be thinking/hoping the 25-year-old can bring the best out of Nichols and lift him from this slump, both mental and professional.</p>
      <h4>Bristol Rovers (3-5-2): Anssi Jaakkola; Rollin Menayese, Tony Craig, Alfie Kilgour; Mark Little, Abu Ogogo, Ed Upson, Liam Sercombe, Luke Leahy; Jonson Clarke-Harris, Tom Nichols</h4>
