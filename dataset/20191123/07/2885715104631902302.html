      <p>After <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/david-warner/">David Warner</a> ruled the proceedings on Day 2 of the opening Test between Australia and Pakistan, it was Marnus Labuschagne’s turn to shine with the bat and inflict further damage on the visitors. The batsman went on to complete his maiden Test century, added 50 more to his tally but fell short by 15 runs from converting it into a double ton.</p>
      <p>However, the job was done and on the way back to the pavilion, the right-handed batsman was greeted with loud cheers from the supporters present at The Gabba. Resuming the innings from an overnight score of 55, Labuschagne went on to add another 130 runs to help Australia tighten their grip on the game.</p>

      <p>His innings was crafted with shots all around the park, which included twenty fours. He first constructed a brilliant partnership with Warner for the second-wicket adding 129 runs and another 110 with Matthew Wade for the fourth wicket.</p>

      <p>In response to Pakistan’s 240, the hosts posted a gigantic 580 on the board. Josh Hazlewood was the final Aussie batsman to be dismissed. For Pakistan, Yasir Shah stood out as the leading wicket-taker as he scalped four in the 48.4 overs he bowled.</p>
      <p>With two days remaining in the contest, the Pakistani batsmen have to pull up their socks and put up a brilliant show in order to save themselves from yet another humiliation.</p>
      <p>Pakistan went into the series after a 3-0 drubbing at home against an inexperienced Sri Lankan unit, and a similar fate continued in Australia, with the Men In Green succumbed to another clean sweep against the Aussies.</p>
