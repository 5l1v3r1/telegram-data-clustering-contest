      <h1>Sony To Make Crash Bandicoot Movie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:52:53+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>It looks like another video game icon from the 90s is getting the movie treatment. New reports indicate that Crash Bandicoot may also be making its way to the big screens.</p>
      <p>Sources to We Got This Covered say that Sony Pictures is currently working on an animated film based on the character. For now, the film will use the game’s basic plot. For the unfamiliar, this involves Crash thwarting the plans of Doctor Neo Cortex.</p>
      <p>Since the film is still in its very early stages of development, there’s naturally no release date for the film just yet. Unfortunately, that is all there is to the information available regarding the animated movie.</p>

      <p>But on that note, it’s nice to see that the Crash Bandicoot film is being made by the character’s original license holder. The character’s relatively recent revival was done by Activision, the publisher of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, and the kart racer Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</p>
      <p>For 90s gamers, this movie is bound to illicit excitement, or at the very least bring back some memories. Of course, there’s still the matter of if the character will look the way we remember it. Since <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198863/new-sonic-the-hedgehog-trailer-goes-live-showcases-more-true-to-source-character-design/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> was there to make that <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/185212/sonic-the-hedgehog-new-design/">mistake</a> first, hopefully this worry doesn’t come to pass.</p>
