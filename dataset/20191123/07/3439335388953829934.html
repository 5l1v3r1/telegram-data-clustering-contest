      <p>ANCHORAGE &gt;&gt; A 71-year-old Alaska man found with $400,000 in illegal drugs hidden in spoiled goat intestines at an airport has been arrested.</p>
      <p>Authorities say Cenen Placencia of Kodiak was arrested Wednesday at Anchorage’s international airport.</p>
      <p>An affidavit filed with charges say investigators with Alaska State Troopers searched a large fish box Placencia had checked as luggage.</p>
      <p>The affidavit says inside was loosely wrapped frozen meat, which was thawed and revealed packages containing about 740 grams of heroin and 389 grams of methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Troopers say Placencia was in custody at the Anchorage jail.</p>
      <p>Online court records didn’t list an attorney for Placencia.</p>
      <p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Christina Sherman says Placencia is scheduled to be arraigned on a charge of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances.</p>
