        <b>Kylie Jenner is a mother of one - Stormi Webster. She had kept her pregnancy under wraps and it seems, she is once again hiding from her fans that she is expecting. But Caitlyn Jenner's recent calculation about her grandchildren might have given away the big news!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott are a parent of a little girl Stormi. The couple had kept Kylie's pregnancy hidden for the longest time and it was only three days after she gave birth, they made the announcement. Now it seems Kylie is expecting her second child and is hiding from all. Fans are going crazy over this because of Caitlyn Jenner's recent revelation about the number of grandchildren she has. On 'I'm A Celebrity', she was asked how many grandchildren she has and Caitlyn said that the number would be 20 in December. </p>
      <p>When Caitlyn was asked on the show, how many grandchildren she has, she said, "20 in December…they call me Boom Boom." Now that left everyone confused as in total, she has 16 grandchildren so far - as per Google. Her son Brandon Jenner, and his girlfriend Cayley Stoker are expecting twins and that takes the total to 18. Mystery prevails over the remaining 2 to make the number 20. Caitlyn's count has got fans talking that Kylie is pregnant again and maybe she is expecting twins. A fan wrote on Twitter, "Is it just me or did Caitlin Jenner just say Kylies pregnant?#ImACeleb." It was a few months ago that rumours of her being pregnant had hit the headlines. However, with Travis and Kylie's split, the rumours died too. </p>
