      <p>I’d recommend using 5g of salt on your first go and increase it a little when you make this classic wholemeal loaf again, to work out what you prefer.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time</b>:  25 minutes, plus 2 hours proving time | <b>Cooking time</b>: 30-40 minutes</p>
      <h3>MAKES</h3>
      <p>One loaf</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>450g strong wholemeal bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>5-7g salt</li>
        <li>1 x 7g sachet dried yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
        <li>350ml water, at a temperature of around 40C</li>
        <li>Oil for brushing the tin</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li> Using an electric stand mixer with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour, salt, yeast and sugar.</li>
        <li>With the motor running on a low speed, slowly add the water and keep mixing until it is amalgamated – about four minutes. It is important to add the water slowly as different flours absorb different amounts of water, and you may find you need a bit less or a bit more.</li>
        <li>Remove the dough hook and cover the bowl with a tea towel. Leave the dough to rise at room temperature for about one hour.</li>
        <li>When the dough has risen and expanded by about half again, put the dough hook back on and mix the dough for five minutes on a medium speed.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. It should be shiny and a bit waxy on the outside – this tells you that the glutens are in line and will stretch with the developing gas from the yeast. Spread the dough out on the work surface, using your fingertips to push it out to make a square, and fold it in half and then into quarters. Spread it out again to a large square, and repeat the folding and spreading a couple of times.</li>
        <li>Brush a 900kg loaf tin with a thin layer of oil. Place the dough in the tin so that it is evenly spread. Put the whole thing in a plastic bag and leave to prove in a warm place for one hour. The dough is ready when it has risen about 2½cm above the edge of the tin. You can check by jabbing the dough with a finger – it should not spring back like it did at the just-kneaded stage.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 220C/200C fan/Gas 7.</li>
        <li>Put the tin in the oven and bake for about 30-40 minutes. The loaf is ready when it’s brown and risen on top, and will easily come out of the tin. I like to put the loaf back in the oven, out of its tin, for another five to 10 minutes to give it a really crispy crust.</li>
