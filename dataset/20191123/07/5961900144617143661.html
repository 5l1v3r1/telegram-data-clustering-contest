      <h1>David Tennant Will Play Serial Killer Dennis Nilsen In New Series &amp; We’re Already Conflicted</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:02:10+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:02</time> by <a rel="author">By Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke</a></address>
      <p>I think I speak for everyone when I say we all have a soft spot for <b>David Tennant</b>, the rather charming star of Dr Who, Broadchurch, Criminal: UK and more. The man is always a joy to watch, even when he’s the baddie in Jessica Jones or Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. But he’s just landed a role that may make him, er, difficult to like.</p>
      <p>Tennant will star in the upcoming true crime-based TV miniseries Des as Scottish serial killer <b>Dennis</b> <b>Nilsen</b>, who murdered at least 12 (and as many as 15) men and boys between 1978-1983.</p>
      <p>The upcoming show was announced by UK channel ITV yesterday — and followed up just a coupla hours later with a first-look image of the actor in character as Nilsen. Note the classic serial killer glasses.</p>

      <p>Des is based on the true crime book Killing for Company by <b>Brian</b> <b>Masters</b>, and according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/first-look-at-david-tennant-dennis-nilsen-1202792936/">Deadline</a> will mostly focus on Nilsen’s state of mind post-arrest.</p>

      <p>The series will also feature The Crown’s <b>Jason Watkins</b> as writer Masters and as a huge Line of Duty fan I’m personally keen to see <b>Daniel Mays</b> (from Season 3) as Detective Chief Inspector <b>Peter Jay</b>.</p>
      <p>The news that David Tennant will play a horrible serial killer follows on from the announcement that <b>Harrison Ford</b> has been tapped to play <b>Michael Peterson</b> in a TV show based on true crime doco The Staircase, so it’s clearly the trend for our faves to play morally murky people on telly.</p>
