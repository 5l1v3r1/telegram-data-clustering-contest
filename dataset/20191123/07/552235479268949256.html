      <p>A Hamilton man has started decorating his house with thousands of Christmas lights to raise money for charity.</p>
      <p>This is the eleventh year Iain Fleming has turned his home into a Winter Wonderland – and it’s all for a great cause.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-three has been working hard on this year’s display to ensure that the switch-on is bigger and better than ever.</p>
      <p>And this time round, Iain and his family have decided to raise money for a cause close to their hearts.</p>
      <p>Iain said: “This year we are doing the switch-on for the Les Hoey DreamMaker Foundation, which has helped a little girl who goes to my girl’s school. They are an amazing charity and we can’t wait to help them.”</p>
      <p>His three daughters Ellie (11), Hollie (8) and Lucy (4) have all been helping him prepare the house for yet another magical display, and are all really excited to see everything come together.</p>
      <p>Every November, Iain begins the process of covering his home from top to bottom in festive lights and decorations and raises money for charity at the same time.</p>
      <p>From inflatable snowmen to Santa on the roof, Iain really pushes the sleigh out every year and attracts crowds from far and wide over the festive period.</p>
      <p>Last year, the hotel manager lit his Forth Terrace home up with over 50,000 lights and also had X Factor runner-up Nicky McDonald go along to sing a few songs, and Santa Claus even stopped by to say hello.</p>
      <p>Iain said: “We are really looking forward to the big switch-on once again this year.</p>
      <p>“Last year’s switch-on was a roaring success and this year will be no different – maybe a few more lights!</p>
      <p>“Santa will make an appearance along with Mr Wiz the Les Hoey Mascot. Entertainment will start at around 5.15pm with DJ Stevie Lennon on the tunes.”</p>
      <p>The switch-on will take place on Sunday, November 24, at 6pm.</p>
      <p>There will be donation buckets outside Iain’s home for the Les Hoey MBE DreamMaker Foundation. leshoeymbedreammakerfoundation.org.</p>
