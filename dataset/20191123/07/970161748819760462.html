      <p>Caitlyn Jenner has already won over the nation on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here – and now I think we love her even more.</p>
      <p>On Friday night there were plenty of laughs as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebrity-viewers-left-hysterics-caitlyn-jenner-falls-window-11204588/">Caitlyn fell out the window on the Dingo Dollar Challenge,</a> and Kate Garraway offered to chew ‘Andrew’s meat’.</p>
      <p>The ITV presenter was then in fits of laughter as she gave<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-in-stitches-as-she-showers-andrew-maxwell-dressed-in-budgie-smugglers-11204178/"> Andrew a shower while he was wearing his budgie smugglers.</a></p>
      <p>It wasn’t all fun and giggles because tensions also rose in the camp over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-in-stitches-as-she-showers-andrew-maxwell-dressed-in-budgie-smugglers-11204178/">the lack of food – Ian Wright got hangry – again.</a></p>
      <p>So if you missed the jam-packed show last night, don’t panic as we have the low-down for you.</p>
      <p>Here were the highlights of Friday night’s I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <h3>Kate offers to chew Andrews ‘meat’</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Things got a little out of hand on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebritys-myles-stephenson-almost-kills-andrew-maxwell-chokes-camel-kate-offers-chew-meat-11204054/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here after Myles Stephenson almost ‘killed’ Andrew Maxwell with his cooking.</a></p>
      <p>As the outlaws in the jailhouse camp tucked into their evening meal of camel fillet, Andrew ate a large part of camel and started to choke as it got stuck in his throat.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway and Andy came to the rescue as they started to hit the comedian on the back, and eventually they managed to get the meat out</p>
      <p>‘Chew your food, mate you scared us,’ exclaimed Myles as Andrew thanked everyone.</p>

      <p>Kate continued: ‘You went bright red, I was like “oh my god”.’</p>
      <p>Andy then pleaded with Andrew ‘not to do that again’ while Cliff offered to chew his meat for him going forwards.</p>
      <p>Kate then joked: ‘I can chew your meat anytime you need.’</p>
      <p>The camp burst out laughing as Kate added:  ‘I didn’t mean it like that.’</p>
      <p>‘I can’t believe I nearly killed Andrew Maxwell,’ Myles added.</p>
      <p>Andrew responded: ‘You didn’t, I nearly killed me.’</p>
      <h3>Kate gives Andrew a shower – and it’s just too funny</h3>
      <p>Picture this – Kate Garraway pouring cold water on Andrew Maxwell while he’s dressed in budgie smugglers – and it’s safe to say Kate could not keep a straight face.</p>
      <p>As the campmates discussed having a shower, Andrew said he was happy to go first as he commented: ‘If you’re gonna wash under a bucket, do it glamour.’</p>

      <p>Andrew changed into his budgie smugglers and as Andy saw them he exclaimed ‘Oh my god, what on earth are they?’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It could have been a scene from a shampoo advert as Kate threw cold water over the comedian as she laughed: ‘Just when you think the Jungle couldn’t get anymore weird, I feel like I’ve gone over the rainbow and I’m in Wizard of Oz or something, it’s too weird.’</p>
      <h3>Tensions rise in the camp over the food (or lack of it)</h3>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> was voted to do the bushtucker trial on Friday night’s show and she chose <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> to do it with her – although they both ended up in the ‘bad camp’.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-a-celebrity-see-tensions-rise-as-jacqueline-jossa-and-myles-stephenson-snub-rival-camp-and-steal-food-11204275/">The duo won six stars for their evening meal – but they had to decide whether to have the food for their camp or the main camp – and they obviously chose their camp.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Myles was upbeat as he exclaimed: ‘Don’t worry we’ve got six stars and we’ve done it fair and square. We’ll be thinking of main camp whilst we’re eating though for sure.’</p>
      <p>They approached the jungle jail where the other campmates were snoozing and they snuck in.</p>
      <p>‘It’s mixed emotions. Smashed the Trial happiness, gutted to leave the others. It’s like being at the Soap Awards here, there’s so many of us,’ laughed Jacqueline.</p>

        <figcaption>It was a tough decision….as you can see (Picture: Rex Features)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Myles and Jacqueline explained that they used rock, paper, and scissors to decide the result.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile back in main camp, Roman Kemp had received a letter containing an announcement.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>He read: ‘Earlier Jacqueline chose Myles to join her in today’s Trial, the Snake Hotel where they won six stars. They were then told they must join the outlaws in the jail house.</p>
      <p>‘However they were given the opportunity of whether to feed the main camp or take the food with them.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline and Myles decided to take the food with them to the Jungle jailhouse. As a result you have just got rice and beans tonight.’</p>
      <h3>Campmates give Cliff a ‘lukewarm’ arrival</h3>
      <p>Some of the celebs in the main camp were a tad ‘disappointed’ at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/im-celebrity-campmates-disappointed-cliff-parisis-arrival-jungle-wanted-chocolate-instead-11204497/">Cliff Parisi’s arrival – as they were hoping for a treat instead.</a></p>
      <p>Even Declan Donnelly noticed the ‘lukewarm welcome’.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/who-is-im-a-celebritys-cliff-parisi-married-to-11202822/">Cliff entered the jungle as a late arrival</a> to the show with new fan-favourite and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-new-campmates-andy-whyment-and-cliff-parisi-pose-with-aussie-wildlife-ahead-of-jungle-debut-11183275/">fellow soap actor Andrew Whyment</a>.</p>

      <p>The actor is best known for appearing as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/who-did-cliff-parisi-play-in-eastenders-as-he-joins-im-a-celebrity-2019-cast-11195980/">Minty Peterson in EastEnders</a> for eight years from 2002 until 2010 as well as appearing on Casualty, Hollyoaks and Call the Midwife.</p>
      <p>It all began when James Haskell and Caitlyn Jenner went to see Kiosk Kev – and as they did they were greeted by a scroll asking them which outlaw they’d like to free for $100 from the Jungle Jailhouse – Andy or Cliff.</p>
      <p>James turned to Caitlyn and joked: ‘I tell you what, I’d rather a bag of crisps or chocolate bar if I’m completely honest with you.’</p>
