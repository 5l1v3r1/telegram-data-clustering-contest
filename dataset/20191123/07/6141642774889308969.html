      <p>The idea that dogs age seven years for every human year is a myth, scientists have claimed.</p>
      <p>University of California researchers said they have also found puppies are middle-aged by the time they are two, although dogs tend to age more slowly than humans in later life.</p>
      <p>By the time they get to three – and are possibly still getting away with things due to being considered young – dogs are closer in age to a 50-year-old human, according to the university’s research.</p>
      <p>The study looked at how dogs aged by focusing on the DNA methylation in 104 Labradors aged between four weeks and 16 years.</p>
      <p>The DNA contains marks that change over time as a cell matures, allowing scientists to track the animal’s biological age.</p>

      <p>After assessing the results, the researchers compared their findings to those from 300 humans.</p>
      <p>By the age of two, the Labrador DNA was equivalent to a human in their early 40s, rather than the 14-year-old, which the traditional formula would suggest.</p>
      <p>However, ageing slows in dogs over time, meaning that by the age of 10, a Labrador is similar to a person aged 68.</p>
      <p>This ties in with the long-held formula for calculating the age of dogs, which was developed on the assumption that most canines lived until around 10, while humans lived until around 70.</p>
      <p>“The expected lifespan of Labrador retrievers, 12 years, correctly translated to the worldwide lifetime expectancy of humans, 70 years,” the researchers said.</p>
      <p>But if anyone thinks this research makes puppies any less lovable, the scientists also observed similarities in the ageing process whereby eight-week-old puppies resembled nine-month-old babies.</p>
