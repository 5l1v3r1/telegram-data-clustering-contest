      <h1>Where to find the best Black Friday 2019 deals, including top offers from Amazon, John Lewis and Currys</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:58:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-reporters/" target="_blank">Telegraph Reporters</a></address>
      <p>Even though Black Friday 2019 officially starts next Friday, November 29, the retailers have got a jump-start this year. Yesterday, exactly a week before the official start date, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/2019/11/22/amazon-black-friday-2019-best-deals-uk-sale-today-offers/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/currys-pc-world-black-friday-deals-best-predictions-2019-sale/">Currys PC World</a> and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/john-lewis-black-friday-2019-deals-best-sale-predictions-headphones/">John Lewis</a> launched their Black Friday deals, and there some are serious savings to be made.</p>
      <p>So far, there are big discounts on TVs, tech, fashion and everything in between. Last year, customers saved £40 million on Amazon alone, and, from looking at the deals that have launched today, it is easy to see why. </p>
      <p>With so many deals already on offer, sale-loving shoppers are truly spoilt for choice this year. But before you start feeling overwhelmed by this choice, we have prepared the following guide on where to find the best Black Friday deals this year.</p>
      <h3>Where can I find the best Black Friday deals?</h3>
      <p>It's hardly surprising that <b>Amazon</b> leads the pack. The retail giant is practically synonymous with Black Friday as it not only brought Black Friday to the UK, but it offers the widest range of deals in the widest range of categories - including <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-tv-deals-black-friday-2019-uk-cyber-monday-sales/">TVs</a>, tech, mobile phones, appliances, laptops, tablets, consoles, smart devices and more.</p>
      <p>Both <b>John Lewis </b>and <b>Currys PC World</b> price-match many of their competitors' best deals, making Currys an easy one-stop-shop for tech and John Lewis a worthwhile destination for higher-end products.</p>
      <p><b>Argos</b> is a good go-to for smart tech and consoles, and last year's Black Friday sale marked their biggest-ever day for video gaming. It's also worth keeping an eye on other cross-category retailers, such as <b>Very </b>and <b>AO</b>, which work hard to beat Amazon's prices every year - especially for home appliances. </p>
      <p>Even British supermarkets have joined in on the hype. <b>Asda</b>, <b>Tesco</b>, <b>Morrisons</b>, <b>Sainsbury's</b>, <b>Aldi</b> and <b>Lidl</b> have all held their own events in the past, offering a wide range of deals on groceries, clothing, tech and homeware. In fact, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/did-black-friday-get-name-history-behind-biggest-sales-event/">Asda's Black Friday sale in 2013 resulted in chaos</a> as customers physically fought for televisions and gadgets. This has since led the supermarket, owned by American retailer Walmart, to offer promotions over a longer period instead. </p>
      <p>Last year, Tesco reduced the price of toys, TVs and mobile phones, while Morrisons offered discounts on perfume, wine and spirits. Sainsbury's also ran deals on their TU clothing range, so we can expect similar deals to appear in the 2019 sales. </p>
      <h3>Best Black Friday deals: Amazon</h3>
      <h4>Echo Dot (3rd Gen)</h4>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Charcoal/dp/B07PJV3JPR/ref=sr_1_1?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=AtcBLpffLP02-21">Was £49.99, now £22</a>

        <figcaption>Echo Dot (3rd Gen) </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>This smart speaker uses voice command (Alexa) to play music, answer questions, update you on the day's news and more. It has a sleek pebble-like design that will suit any room, and it's impressive 56 per cent discount makes it particularly good value for money. If you already have a pair of decent speakers, however, Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Input-White-audio-input-Bluetooth/dp/B07C7MSKPD?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Echo Input</a> (which allows any external speaker to become an Alexa-enabled device) at over half price today, at £14.99, down from £34.99.</p>

      <p>We're surprised that the Echo Show 8 is in the sales, and with such a significant discount, given that it is a brand new model. This 8-inch HD Smart Display connects to Alexa and allows you to view your photos, hear the day's news, set an alarm or listen to music, with its rich stereo sound.  If you're looking for even more of a bargain, try to Echo Show 5, also in today's sales, which is now just £49.99, down from £79.99.</p>

It also has a more powerful suction than the older model, and 150 per cent more brush bar power than the V6 Animal. Like all cordless Dyson products, however, the V8 is lightweight and easy to use - the days of tripping over the lead are over.</p>

      <p>This 55" television has excellent picture quality, due to the 4K Ultra HD screen definition that can optimise even non-4K content, including films and television shows. Complete with a Dolby Atmos sound system, you can expect a cinematic effect. Even better, this is a smart TV, meaning you can ask the in-built Google Assistant to turn up the volume or change the channel without having to scramble for the remote control. </p>

      <p>Invest in a new set of frying and saucepans from Tefal this Black Friday, and give your kitchen appliances a much-needed spruce in time for Christmas.  This 22-piece stainless steel set is both easy to use and easy to store, with removable handles (which attach with a simple click) on the pieces. If you take off the handles, the set can go in the oven (up to 175°C) and, after the hard work is done, the set can go straight in the dishwasher. </p>
