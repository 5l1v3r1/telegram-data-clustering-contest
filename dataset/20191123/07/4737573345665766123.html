      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) â€“ The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) Banqiao station in New Taipei City was filled with smoke on Saturday (Nov. 23) morning after train wheels overheated, causing terrified passengers to flee.</p>
      <p>According to a Facebook post shared by a train passenger, the incident occurred at around 11 a.m. A lot of smoke billowed up from underneath the train compartments.</p>
      <p>The man who posted about the incident said he heard a woman shouting hysterically from the platform, followed by passengers yelling, "I smell something burning!" and "Everyone out!" The train was delayed 22 minutes before setting off again.</p>
      <p>TRA apologized for the incident, saying the fifth compartment of the train had a slightly malfunctioning buffer, causing it to move when the train was braking. The smoke and burned smell were caused by over-heating of the train wheels, reported <a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/201911230075.aspx">CNA</a>.</p>
