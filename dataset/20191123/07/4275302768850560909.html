      <h2>A Dundee digital firm is playing a crucial role in Scottish beer firm BrewDog’s expansion in America.</h2>

      <p>City Quay-based mtc has worked with the Ellon-based craft brewer for several of its Equity for Punks crowdfunding campaigns in the UK.</p>
      <p>They have led to more than 100,000 people owning a stake in the firm and more than £70 million raised through the mtc built website.</p>
      <p>It has also developed the digital platform for its new funding campaign for BrewDog USA, which looks to raise more than $7m.</p>
      <p>BrewDog opened a 100,000 sq ft brewery in Columbus, Ohio in 2017 and last year opened a beer themed hotel on the 42-acre site.</p>
      <p>Director Alex McDonald said: “BrewDog USA came to us to give them the flexibility they needed to manage the rewards and referrals as part of the campaign.</p>
      <p>“We are supporting it round the clock from a technical point of view from Dundee.”</p>
      <p>mtc, which works with around 30 breweries, has also developed a new app for deliveries of BrewDog beers.</p>
      <p>“The Hop Drop app means that in London you can get beer delivered to you within 45 minutes of ordering,” Mr McDonald added.</p>
      <p>“It also allows people in bars to order from the comfort of their seats and their food and drinks will be brought to their tables.</p>
      <p>“It’s been rolled out in all of the BrewDog bars, including Dundee, Perth and St Andrews.</p>
      <p>“The other big thing for the app is push notification.</p>
      <p>“On Friday afternoons we put our messages promoting the delivery service and also letting people outwith London know what’s on tap at their local bars.”</p>
      <p>mtc was founded in Dundee 20 years ago and now has 120 staff with around 70 people based in the city. As well as offices in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, the firm employs around 30 overseas.</p>
      <p>mtc has launched more than 150 websites this year across several sectors and is set to grow further in 2020.</p>
