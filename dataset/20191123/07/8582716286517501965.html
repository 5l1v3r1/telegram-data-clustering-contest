      <p><b>KOBE — </b>A labor standard office has concluded that the 2017 suicide of an employee at a Mitsubishi Electric Corp unit was work-related, recognizing he did more than 100 hours of overtime per month while in a supervisory position, company officials said.</p>
      <p>The Oct 4 certification for the death of the engineer in his 40s at Melco Semiconductor Engineering Corp came as labor authorities have stepped up monitoring after finding that a slew of firms have promoted workers to supervisory positions to make them work longer hours.</p>
      <p>The Japanese labor law limits working hours of regular employees but the restrictions do not apply to workers in supervisory positions.</p>
      <p>The worker was on loan to another Mitsubishi Electric unit from April 2013 and became mentally ill after working extensively at a plant in Toyooka in Hyogo Prefecture.</p>
      <p>He killed himself in December 2017 after being transferred to work in Fukuoka, southwestern Japan, and his family filed for the certification of his death as work-related in July last year.</p>
      <p>In Fukuoka, the discretionary labor system was applied to him. It rewards workers based on fixed overtime work hours instead of actual hours worked.</p>
      <p>"We take seriously the fact that a worker at a related company has died. We will work on thoroughly implementing appropriate labor control," Mitsubishi Electric said in a statement Friday.</p>
      <p>The labor authorities awarded workers' compensation to five employees at Mitsubishi Electric between 2014 and 2017, of whom two had committed suicide.</p>
