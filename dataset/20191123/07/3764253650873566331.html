      <p>Nigeria's Super Sand Eagles on Friday night, November 22, began their campaign at the 2019 World Cup with an embarrassing 10-1 defeat against Portugal.</p>
      <p>Audu Adamu's side started the match impressively with the former Warri Wolves and Kwara United star Abu Azeez scoring the first goal for Nigeria.</p>
      <p>But the Super Sand Eagles lost concentration after scoring the first goal and they went on to concede fives goals in the second period.</p>
      <p>Nigeria came out aggressively in the third period looking for goals, but they were unable to stop high flying Portuguese side who added another five goals.</p>
