        <b>England were "flat" and got their tactics wrong as New Zealand gained the upper hand of the first Test on day three, says ex-batsman Mark Ramprakash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tourists only took two wickets as BJ Watling's unbeaten 119 helped New Zealand move from a 209-run deficit to a lead of 41 runs, finishing on 394-6.</p>
      <p>Ramprakash said England lacked a "spark" and were "predictable" by bowling too many short balls.</p>
      <p>But coach Chris Silverwood said it was not a flat showing "in the slightest".</p>

      <p>"It is a flat pitch," said Silverwood, who is taking charge of England in a Test for the first time.</p>
      <p>"We implemented plans and gave them time to work. We showed decent discipline with the ball but that is the game."</p>
      <p>All-rounder Ben Stokes and captain Joe Root were the only bowlers to take a wicket during the day's play with frontline bowlers Stuart Broad, Jofra Archer and Sam Curran all toiling without reward at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui.</p>
      <p>There were also two dropped catches, including Stokes' costly drop of Watling when he was on 31, and a number of misfields.</p>
      <p>Ramprakash, who was England's batting coach until earlier this year, told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07vvhv2">BBC Test Match Special's podcast:</a> "It was a flat day, you can't get away from that.</p>
      <p>"It has been an area England have struggled with for a number of years because of the number of introverted, quiet personalities they have - sometimes they lack a spark visually.</p>
      <p>"The pitch was benign but somehow you need several people to create a bit of spark.</p>
      <p>"We know the natural psyche of this team is if they are behind and concede a lead the batters don't react well to that because their natural game is to attack. It will be a big test for them."</p>
      <h3>'Root is misusing Archer'</h3>
      <p>Archer is making his first appearance in an overseas Test for England, having starred in this summer's Ashes, taking 22 wickets in four Tests.</p>
      <p>He was below his best on day three, with figures of 0-84 from 30 overs and at times repeatedly bowled bouncers on a flat pitch.</p>
      <p>Ramprakash said Archer is a "better bowler than the role he is being asked to do".</p>
      <p>"I don't agree with the way Jofra Archer is being asked to bowl," said Ramprakash, who played 52 Tests for England.</p>
      <p>"He has not been picked because he bowls five bouncers an over, that was not why he was selected for England.</p>
      <p>"Joe Root has a new toy and there has to be communication and some understanding of how to get the best out of him.</p>
      <p>"I don't mind the odd spell of short-pitched bowling but England overdid that."</p>
