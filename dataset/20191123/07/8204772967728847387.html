      <h1>Arachas set to change hands as Sovereign plots exit</h1>
      <h2>State’s largest independent general insurance broking group has over 250 employees</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:30:27+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/joe-brennan-7.3747169" target="_blank">Joe Brennan</a></address>
      <p>Dublin-based insurance provider <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Arachas+Corporate+Brokers">Arachas Corporate Brokers</a> is close to changing hands, a little over two years after UK private equity firm <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Sovereign+Capital">Sovereign Capital</a> Partners took a controlling stake when it backed a management buyout of the business.</p>
      <p>Sovereign is in advanced talks to sell its 54 per cent interest in Arachas, the largest independent general insurance broking group in the State, according to sources.</p>
      <p>However, they declined to reveal the identities of the final bidders in the process or give financial details.</p>
      <p>It is also unclear whether former chief executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Donal+Cronin">Donal Cronin</a> plans to sell his 23 per cent stake in Arachas as part of a transaction.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Arachas, which has more than 250 employees, declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Sovereign did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>The development comes four months after Arachas acquired Murray &amp; Spelman, an insurance and finance brokerage with offices in Galway and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Kildare">Kildare</a> that was chaired by former minister for finance Charlie McCreevey, for an undisclosed sum. The deal excluded Murray &amp; Spelman’s financial services arm.</p>
      <p>Arachas, whose name is Irish for insurance, was established a decade and a half ago through the merger of Cork-based broker Tyrrell Coakley with two Dublin-based peers, Hodgins Percival and Slattery Jermyn.</p>
      <p>The company made three acquisitions soon after the 2017 management buyout – including the purchases of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Kidd+Insurances">Kidd Insurances</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Capital+Cover+Group">Capital Cover Group</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Clover+Centre+Insurance">Clover Centre Insurance</a>. Insurance executive <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Conor+Brennan">Conor Brennan</a> left <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Zurich+Insurance">Zurich Insurance</a> early last year to take over as chief executive of Arachas.</p>
      <h3>Dominated</h3>
      <p>The insurance brokerage landscape is dominated by a few global companies, including <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Aon">Aon</a> and Dublin-headquartered <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Willis+Towers+Watson">Willis Towers Watson</a>, which were parties to abortive merger talks earlier this year, as well as Marsh &amp; McLennon, which acquired major rival Jardine <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Lloyd+Thompson">Lloyd Thompson</a> in April.</p>
      <p>Industry sources said Arachas’s business would be of interest to these groups or to another private equity buyer. Smaller domestic operators have been subject to a wave of consolidation in recent times.</p>
      <p>The most recent set of accounts for Arachas Corporate Brokers Ltd shows its turnover rose to €18.2 million in 2017 from €17.2 million a year earlier. These figures do not reflect growth from the flurry of deals after Sovereign took a controlling stake.</p>
      <p>Accounts for 2018 have not yet been filed with the Companies <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Registration">Registration</a> Office. However, group revenues are reported to be running well in excess of €30 million.</p>
