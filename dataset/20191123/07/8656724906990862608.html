      <p>Most people can’t afford the shinny new <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/apple-launches-new-iphone-xs-xs-max-xr-best-iphones-ever/">iPhone Xs</a> or Samsung Galaxy phones but would like to own one. A secondhand smartphone or refurbished smartphones are not just used devices. These reconditioned devices are offered for sale after being used or returned for a problem and should be subject to several technical tests before being put back on the market. It should be noted that there are some used devices that have no malfunction or technical issues especially if the original owner sold it off to upgrade to a newer model</p>
      <p>Secondhand smartphones are sometime passed off as new smartphones by some downtown smartphone dealers so one has to be very vigilant when buying a new smartphone especially online. Most of these phones are not certified reconditioned devices. Reconditioned smartphones are therefore used, or unsold devices that have reported malfunctions or imperfections and that after a certain process have been reset as if they were new. The reconditioning process includes not only the functionalities but also the aesthetic characteristics of the product.</p>

      <p>As you can easily guess, reconditioned phones differ from secondhand smartphones because the latter are proposed in the state of use in which they are found. Reconditioned smartphones look brand new: they are in fact sold in their purchase package with all the necessary accessories, also have been duly tested.</p>
      <h3>How secondhand smartphones are refurbished</h3>
      <p>A secondhand smartphone either be refurbished or sold as is and this reconditioning process concerns functionality and aesthetics. They will undergo several stages before they reach the shop window:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Aesthetics</b>: Damaged parts are repaired or replaced (scratches on the display or body, for example)</li>
        <li><b>Operation</b>: Main functions (power on, touchscreen, keyboard, audio) and components are checked and repaired if necessary</li>
        <li><b>Accessory check</b>: all accessories included in the purchase package are checked and repaired in case of imperfections or malfunction</li>
        <li><b>Reset</b>: Reset to clear all data and return the device to its initial state as when it left the factory. Sometimes devices are supplied with a software version that is more up to date than the one offered at the time of the smartphone’s release</li>
        <li><b>Cleaning</b>: The smartphone undergoes a sanitization process that covers all components</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Warranty issues</h3>
      <p>Most people don’t care about warranties, but reconditioned smartphones should have a 12-month warranty, but this is not true for secondhand smartphone. The warranty is not offered by the brand manufacturer but by the company that has taken on the reconditioning process. Before purchasing a reconditioned device, make sure that the warranty is present, check its duration and check who you should contact if you have any problems with the device.</p>
      <h3>Merits of buying a reconditioned or secondhand smartphone</h3>
      <p>Buying a secondhand or refurbished smartphone offers two main advantages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The ability to buy a high-end smartphone at a price significantly lower than the list price without giving up the warranty</li>
        <li>Save the environment: choosing a reconditioned smartphone avoids the emission of yet another WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Precautions to be taken before buying</h3>
      <p>Its obvious that a refurbished smartphone is cheaper than the new one, but don’t expect a <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/how-to-get-a-cheap-iphone-x/">iPhone X </a>for UGX 500,000 ($150). So beware of offers that look too good to be true, they could actually be scams. Just like when you buy a secondhand smartphone, be careful to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Product description</b>: is it accurate and correct?</li>
        <li><b>Reseller</b>: If you are buying online, check comments and reviews from other users for reliability</li>
        <li><b>Warranty</b>: make sure it’s present</li>
        <li><b>Pre-check before you leave</b>: Before you leave the shop, it’s good to set up the device with the store and pre-check that most features work and the phone has no functional issues.</li>
      </ul>
