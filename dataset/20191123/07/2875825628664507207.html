      <h2>The latest instalment of the Football Manager series has been released - but which tactics should you be using to deliver success?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Football Manager 2020 finally hit the shelves this week, giving football fans the chance to lead their team to glory.</p>
      <p>If you are a Spurs fan that hated the Jose Mourinho appointment, an <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fan unhappy with Unai Emery, or just a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> fan that wants to recreate the glory days of Alex Ferguson, Football Manager 2020 lets you do it. However, the tactics you use to do it are up to you.</p>
      <p>FM20 has a deep and customisable set of tactics options with a solid induction walkthrough that can familiarise those new to the game with the choices they have to make.</p>
      <p>To get the very best out of the game and achieve ultimate success, you’ll need to tweak these initial tactical frameworks to suit not only your team, but also some of the more overpowered aspects of the game’s match engine and simulation system.</p>

      <h3>Gegenpress - 4-1-4-1 DM Wide</h3>
      <p>This tactical style is best understood by watching any Jurgen Klopp side. The constant running and endless pressing style requires certain player archetypes to work well, but it can absolutely lead you to trophies.</p>
      <p>Using this tactic with the 4-1-4-1 DM Wide formation, effectively a 4-3-3, is usually preferable. It provides some cover at the back with the defensive midfielder and has the width to really stretch your opposition both vertically and horizontally.</p>
      <p>You can make a few tweaks to it, specifically changing the 'Carrilero' central midfielder. There are very few players with this as a natural, or even accomplished, role.</p>
      <p>An easy switch is to make this central midfielder a 'Ball Winning Midfielder' in games that you expect to be close and a 'Deep Lying Playmaker' in games that should be more comfortable for you to win.</p>
      <p>Within this tactic it is key to ensure your striker doesn’t get too isolated. A good way to do this is to set overlaps from both of your wing backs.</p>
      <p>With your wide forwards set as 'Inside Forwards' they can help somewhat, but the overlaps help to keep your attacking width and makes sure there is space for your striker to work in and your 'Box To Box Midfielde'r to run into.</p>
      <p>If you are behind and need to find a goal then pull your defensive midfielder off for either an attacking central midfielder (AMC) or second striker.</p>
      <p>If you add a AMC then setting your midfield duo to 'Ball Winning' and 'Box To Box' is key so that there is still a link between attack and defence.</p>

      <h3>Vertical Tiki-Taka - 5-2-1-2 WB</h3>
      <p>The Gegenpress is good, but the emphasis on high intensity running and pressing means it is tough to use in lower leagues or non-elite teams as the it is highly demanding physically.</p>
      <p>That’s where the Vertical Tiki-Taka comes in.</p>
      <p>This tactic is the natural evolution of Tiki-Taka that came to prominence with Pep Guardiola’s <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> side and the all-conquering Spanish teams. While it asks your players to dominate possession and press hard without the ball, it also emphasises moving the ball vertically up field rather than patiently waiting for openings by passing sideways.</p>
      <p>One of the best formations to use for this tactic is the 5-2-1-2 WB. It is perfect if you take over a team with good midfield depth and few wingers, as it packs the middle of the park and gives you a firm spine of the team.</p>
      <p>With one 'Cover' central defender and two 'Ball Playing' central defenders you have a strong back line that allows the wing backs to push on and provide width.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the midfield pivot of 'Box To Box' and 'Ball Winning' midfielders will keep you solid without the ball and dangerous with it.</p>
      <p>A narrow front three of an advanced AMC in the Advanced 'Playmaker' role and two strikers, one 'False Nine' and one 'Complete Striker', puts a lot of pressure on the opposition to play narrow in defence, opening up those spots for your wing backs to strike.</p>
      <p>The 'False Nine' can be a difficult role to fit a striker into, so changing these two to 'Deep Lying Forward' and 'Advanced Forward' can be more productive for most sides.</p>

      <h3>Fluid Counter-Attack - 4-4-2</h3>
      <p>While many players are tempted to jump into the hot seat at Barcelona, Manchester United, or Bayern Munich, there are plenty of teams in FM20 that can’t play free-flowing attacking football right away.</p>
      <p>If you are taking over a newly-promoted side or one that needs a steadying influence after poor performances, then having a defensive tactic up your sleeve is always handy.</p>
      <p>While the 4-4-2 formation may seem outdated in modern football, it is still in use in lower leagues and for a good reason: structure.</p>
      <p>The two banks of four, along with one centre back set to 'No-Nonsense' and a 'Ball Winning' midfielder, is tough to break down, while the wide midfielder on the left and winger on the right provide good cover for your full backs.</p>
      <p>Both the wide players and one centre midfielder are should be set to “support” so that when you have the ball there are options up the field to keep hold of it. The front two should have one 'Pressing Forward' and one 'Advanced Forward', but if that is a touch too defensive then changing to a 'Target Man' can help if you have a physical presence up front.</p>
