      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray tore into the BJP on Saturday for joining hands with a rebel NCP leader to form a government, describing the stunning development as a "surgical strike" on Maharashtra -- one, he said, that the people would avenge.</p>
      <p>He also dared the BJP to try and break his party.</p>
      <p>Uddhav Thackeray's comments came at a joint press conference with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), part of the three-party opposition alliance that's been working to form a government.</p>
      <p>The other party in the rival grouping, the Congress, did not send representatives to the press meet.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who spoke before Uddhav at the press meet, said a legislature party meeting of the Congress was under way at the time.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar has said his nephew Ajit Pawar's extraordinary decision to defect to a coalition led by the BJP didn't have the NCP's support.</p>
      <p>Pawar senior also warned his MLAs against breaking ranks, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sharad-pawar-maharashtra-shiv-sena-ncp-1621928-2019-11-23">pointing out that an anti-defection law was in place</a>.</p>
