      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | BBC pundit says recent run has been a 'reality check' for AVFC following the gut-wrenching, late defeat to Jurgen Klopp's men at Villa Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:47:25+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:47</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Mark Lawrenson has claimed Aston Villa still haven’t recovered from their result against Liverpool.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-liverpool-live-robertson-17188264">Dean Smith’s side were beaten 2-1 by the Reds at the start of the month</a> in the second of a three-match losing streak they are hoping to halt against Newcastle United on Monday.</p>
      <p>As they have on several occasions in the Premier League this season, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> took the lead before conceding game-changing goals late in the second-half, with Sadio Mane's winner coming in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Lawrenson says the past month has been a reality check for Villa – but nevertheless tipped them to get back to winning ways on Steve Bruce’s return to Villa Park.</p>

      <p>Predicting a 2-0 home win in his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50490801">BBC Sport</a> column, the Liverpool legend wrote: “Former Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce returns to Villa Park with his Newcastle on a good little run, after taking seven points from their past three games.</p>
      <p>“It was not long ago that you could say the same about Villa, who went on an identical run at the start of October, but they have lost their past three league games.</p>
      <p>“Villa have not really recovered from losing so late on against Liverpool, and the past few weeks have been a bit of reality check for them.</p>
      <p>“That is what life is like for a promoted team, with as many downs as ups, but I think Villa will be smiling again on Monday night.”</p>
