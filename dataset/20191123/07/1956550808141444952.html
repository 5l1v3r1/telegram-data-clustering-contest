And this month if you buy any burger and a house drink, you’ll get the whole thing for Dhs99. All burgers (apart from the mighty Beast) are included in the deal, so get your chops around that. Or if you’re dining with an equally peckish diner, opt for any burger meal and you’ll get one 6oz classic burger sandwich absolutely free. Pass us that ketchup, it’s going to get messy.<br/><i>Open Sat-Wed noon-midnight, Thu-Fri noon-2am. Burj Daman Building, DIFC (04 514 8838).</i><br/><br/><b>Fogo De Chão</b><br/>This cool Brazilian restaurant in DIFC has an awesome deal that carnivores will want to check out. Every day you can head to the lounge area and order up a picanha burger and two drinks for Dhs100. The burger, which is normally Dhs99 on its own, is topped with cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, chimichurri aioli and served on a brioche bun with fries.<br/><i>Dhs99. Daily 4pm-11pm. Central Park Tower, DIFC (04 3438867).</i><br/><br/><b>Pickl</b><br/>Love burgers? We’re with you on that. And if you buy two meals at Pickl. you’ll also get two free ice cream burgers to round it all off with. Now you just need to choose your main course (our advice – the spicy chicken is top).<br/><i>Prices vary. Valid Sun-Thu 11am-4pm. One JLT, JLT (04 584 6859).</i><br/><br/><b>Ribs &amp; Brews</b><br/>At this cool, industrial-themed ground-floor bar in Al Habtoor City, you’ll be able to spend an afternoon catching the footy (or other sport of your choosing), with some top grub – and you can save a few fils while you’re at it. From noon until 1am every Monday you can get your hands on the gigantic man cave burger with a pint of the black stuff for Dhs195.<br/><i>Open Sat-Tue noon-1am, Wed-Fri noon-2am. Hilton Dubai Al Habtoor City (04 435 5577).</i><br/><br/><b>The Blacksmith</b><br/>There’s no shortage of Deep South-inspired meateries in this city, but The Blacksmith is among the most authentic in town so if you’re mad about meat, this is the deal for you. Sample the belly-busting Texas Brisket Sandwich – a fresh potato roll layered with 14-hour smoked brisket and topped with pickles, onions and barbecue sauce, and a pint for just Dhs69. Lip-smackingly good, all for under Dhs100.<br/><i>Open Sun-Wed 5pm-2am, Thu-Sat 5pm-3am. Wyndham Dubai Marina, Dubai Marina (04 407 8873).</i></p>
