      <h1>OUCH: Elon Musk’s Net Worth Took A $1.1B Hit After Awks Unveiling Of “Bulletproof” Cybertruck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:44:21+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:44</time> by <a rel="author">By Josephine Rozenberg-Clarke</a></address>
      <p>You will have probably seen<b> Elon Musk </b>unveiling Tesla’s fancy new vehicle, the Cybertruck, all over the internet today. After all, some people are roasting the hell out of Tesla’s first foray into the pickup truck (or humble ute, in Aus) for looking like something straight out of a B-grade video game while others actually think it’s pretty sick.</p>
      <p>I’m neither a car person or an Elon Musk stan, so I’m pretty on the fence about it — but like everyone else, I couldn’t help but laugh when the demonstration of the Cybertruck’s supposedly indestructible windows resulted in the windows shattering just after Musk told the crowd at the unveiling: “It is literally bulletproof to a 9mm handgun.”</p>

      <p>After the steel ball thrown at the windows did their very obvious damage, Musk quipped: “It didn’t go through, that’s the plus side.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/11/22/elon-musk-net-worth-cybertruck/#7874d23573aa">Forbes</a> reports that the presentation, aside from embarrassing, was also damaging to Tesla’s share prices, with the publication reporting that as of November 22 they had tumbled by 6%.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t sound like much, but crunch those numbers and for Elon Musk’s personal net worth, that’s a USD$768 million drop (or an eye-watering AUD$1.1 billion). Yikes. It’s okay though, because he’s still worth an estimated USD$26 billion (AUD$38 billion) and is the 41st richest man on the planet.</p>
      <p>Dunno bout you, but I’d still be breathing easy if I was Elon Musk.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/elon-musk-net-worth-tesla-cybertruck">The Guardian</a> reminds us that it’s not the first time Tesla’s stocks have taken a dive after one of Elon Musk’s stunts — when he smoked a joint live on the Joe Rogan Podcast, they also dropped by 6%. Can’t a man live?</p>
