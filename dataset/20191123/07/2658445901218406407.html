      <p>It is indeed a worthy commendation and acknowledgement of exemplary services to his alma mater, that the Governing Council and the Senate of the University of Benin have  deemed it fit to confer the LLD (Honoris Causa) on Chief Richard Oma Ahonaruogho,  who is an alumnus of the university and a past president of the University of Benin  Alumni Association (Worldwide) during this year’s convocation ceremony.</p>
      <p>“Ritchie” as commonly referred to by family, friends, colleagues and associates, the  honoree, is a man of several parts, who at various times in his adult life has made indelible marks and impacts in the lives of several persons in different facets of life with whom he had interfaced. The word “enigmatic” appropriately captures the essence of his person and there is indeed a resonating and resounding applause that the conferment of Doctor of Law (Honoris Causa) on him by the university is in acknowledgment of his tireless  service to that citadel of learning, subsequent to his graduation and meritorious service  in several offices he held in the alumni association, culminating in establishment of  branches in Europe and America and approximately bestowing “Worldwide” as  appendage to the University of Benin Alumni Association (UBAA).</p>
      <p>Malvolio, the parody of puritan behavior in William Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night” reads  the following from a letter he finds: In my stars I am above thee; but be not afraid of  greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust  upon them. This is a classic exemplification from Shakespeare, the master of words,  explaining “Greatness” in different manifestations. Erkthecrux defines and explains greatness as an acquisition of status by the people who have contributed to an  organisation, group or purpose that is greater than themselves. It is defined as the deeds  of people that make their world a better place. To provide a purpose for those who have  no purpose, sustain it, mitigate it from damage and praise it in any way they can while  still maintaining their own dignity. Jesus Christ in the Book of Mark 10 : 42 – 43 said that  whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first  among you, must be slave to all.</p>
      <p>From the above classic and ecclesiastical definitions and explanations, greatness in simple terms, is serving others for the glory of God. It is tantamount to a genuine expression of humility. This is true greatness as the Saviour defined it – serving others to the glory of God. It is in a nutshell, selfless service. Selfless service is an acronym that appropriately describes Chief Richard Oma  Ahonaruogho, the celebrant. It is a truism and an incontrovertible fact that his life in all  aspects and ramifications is service to humanity, irrespective of race, nationality, tribe, religion or gender. According to Nelson Mandela, one of the Icons of this century, the word “Power” is not defined by how much control you have over others, but how much  control you have over yourself. It is not about the quantum of material acquisition. It is  about how many people you inspire. Purposefulness, self-confidence, boldness,  optimism, forgiveness, courage, determination, humility, self reflection and love are ten qualities of greatness inspired by the words of Nelson Mandela. This is further  corroborated by Booker T Washington, who explained that excellence is to do a common  thing in an uncommon way. These are qualities that necessarily define a man that lived  and left his footprints in the sands of time.</p>
      <p>In “Edunews”, a publication of the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN) on the  18th day of January, 2018 in a story captioned, “Lawyer Donates ICT Centre To Alma  Mater” it was reported as follows: To aid pupils in their academic work, a lawyer, Chief  Richard Oma Ahonaruogho has donated an ICT Centre to Victory High School, Ikeja,  Lagos. At the presentation ceremony, he stated, ‘It was a project done by my wife and I  to give the pupils a better atmosphere and equip them with ICT Skills. You cannot  underestimate the importance of ICT in our world today and it is important that the  pupils are not left behind.” The Philanthropist (Chief Richard Oma Ahonaruogho) also  gives scholarships to pupils and a N50,000 Endowment to the Best Graduating Pupil. He  has also promised to sponsor any pupil who gained admission to study Law at the  University of Benin up to Masters level. The School Principal, Mr. Jolayemi Odedele,  said, “Richard has always been supportive of the school. He has done a lot and is still  doing more. He made a promise to us to donate the ICT Centre to the School and he has fulfilled it.”</p>
      <p>Richard was the Labour Prefect of Victory High School in 1978/1979 academic sessions.  He later proceeded to the University of Benin (Uniben) as a student in the pioneer law  class of 1981. He was the founding Vice President of the Law Students Association  (LAWSA) and after graduating from Uniben was very active in the Nigerian Bar  Association, the African Bar Association and served as International Bar Association  (IBA) Country Representative from Nigeria from April 2000 to March, 2006 among  several other offices that he held in the legal profession, locally and globally.</p>
      <p>I met Richard as a fellow pioneer law student in the faculty of law of the University of  Benin in 1981 and we have since been close family friends and associates. In the course of our legal practice, we have both attended several local and international conferences and participated in bar association activities. Richard has an unusual zeal and sagacity and  fully committed to whatever he does. He is a loyal friend and most dependable person.</p>
      <p>His love for our alma mater, the University of Benin is unequalled by any alumnus that I  know. In an interview that Richard granted to ThisDay Newspapers on the 6th January, 2015 he  stated that Late Chief Olasupo Moroundiya, a most reputable legal practitioner had been the most influential person in his life: “My closeness to him gave me a greater insight into life and upon getting married, I had no hesitation to join the church at which he  worshiped, the First Baptist Church, Ikeja”. He further stated that he was encouraged  from childhood by his grandmother, Madam (Deaconess) Elizabeth Olugbo to become a  lawyer because of early.</p>
