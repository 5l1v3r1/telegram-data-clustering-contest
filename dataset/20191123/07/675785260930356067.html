      <h1>Voice of the Mirror: 'Rotten that super elite can buy access to Prime Minister'</h1>
      <h2>Members of the Leader’s Group - made of a handful of super rich donors - can pay to wine and dine in private with Boris Johnson and other ministers, but the Tories refuse to reveal who they are</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:47:30+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:47</time> by <a rel="author">Voice of the Mirror, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/voice-of-the-mirror/</a></address>
      <p>There is something rotten with a country that allows an elite few to buy access to the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Yet this is how the Tory Party operates. A handful of super-rich donors called the Leader’s Group can pay to wine and dine in private with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and other ministers.</p>
      <p>To add to the stench surrounding this arrangement, the party is refusing to say who was present at these exclusive events.</p>
      <p>What we do know is that Leader’s Group members worth a collective £45.7billion have given £130million to the Tories since 2010.</p>
      <p>Britain used to pride itself on being one of the least corrupt countries in the world.</p>
      <p>Now we have a political party bankrolled by billionaires that doctors campaign videos, bans journalists and withholds Parliamentary reports because they could be embarrassing.</p>

      <p>This is behaviour you expect in a failed state, not one of the world’s oldest democracies.</p>
      <p>A party in hock to fatcats will always put their needs before yours.</p>
      <p>A party of millionaires will never understand why kids go hungry.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives are corrupting our  politics and corroding our society.</p>
      <h3>Now or never</h3>

      <p>Prince Charles will today travel to the Solomon Islands to witness the impact of the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>Rising sea levels and changing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> is already threatening this Pacific paradise.</p>
      <p>But no part of the world is immune. Which is why the Prince is right to warn we may have just 10 years to save the planet.</p>
      <p>If carbon levels continue to rise, we will hit the tipping point where damage is irreversible.</p>
      <p>The time for real action has never been  more urgent.</p>

      <p>Scientists have come up with a formula for the perfect British chip.</p>
      <p>It should be 2.8 inches long, quarter of an inch thick and made from Maris Pipers.</p>
      <p>Anything else is just half-baked.</p>
