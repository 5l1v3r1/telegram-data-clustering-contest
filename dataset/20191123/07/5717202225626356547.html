      <h1>Jose Mourinho appointment could benefit Danny Rose at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Danny Rose has two players to compete for the left-back spot with him.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:15:39+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur defender Danny Rose could be handed a lifeline under Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>It has been a bit of a struggle for Rose this season. He has not been able to maintain a good run of form, coinciding with Tottenham’s poor performances as a team. But with Mourinho now at the helm, Rose could start to turn things around.</p>
      <h3>Rose struggles</h3>
      <p>Rose has not been able to show why he should be the regular starting left-back. Mauricio Pochettino was unsure whether to use him or Ben Davies with Ryan Sessegnon now coming into contention too.</p>
      <p>With two other left-backs competing for the starting spot, Rose needs to find his form to keep his place. If his form continues to dip, he might find his Tottenham playing days are coming to an end.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho previously wanted Rose</h3>

      <p>Back while Mourinho was at Manchester United, he wanted to sign Rose. He was unimpressed with Luke Shaw and thought that Rose fit the bill as a perfect left-back replacement.</p>
      <p>When Man United refused to sanction a £40m swoop for Rose, Mourinho reportedly responded furiously (<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-5233235/Mourinhos-fury-not-sealing-40m-deal-Danny-Rose.html">as per The Daily Mail</a>). But Mourinho has now been granted his wish to work with the England left-back.</p>
      <h3>New manager bounce</h3>
      <p>Both Tottenham and Rose could enjoy a new manager bounce. With fresh ideas and a revived state of mind, Tottenham could turn their league form around under a proven big-name boss.</p>
      <p>Mourinho could give Rose the chance to prove himself in the left-back position. This confidence-boost could, in turn, lead to Rose’s revival at Tottenham.</p>
