      <p>Elated with the film’s success, Ayushmann said: “While I have always believed in the concept of art for art sake, I do realise that for an industry to thrive and grow, it is necessary that the films do really well.</p>
      <p>“So, more than my personal milestones of <b>100 crore</b> hits, I’m happy that I could contribute towards the growth of my industry as well as present some really good films to audiences in the process.”</p>
      <p>Directed by Amar Kaushik, “<i>Bala</i>“, which also features Yami Gautam and Bhumi Pednekar, revolves around the issue of premature baldness.</p>
      <p>As film is doing so well, Ayushmann considers himself “fortunate”.</p>
      <p>“Every artiste wants their film to reach the maximum number of people, entertain them and leave them with a thought or a message to take home. I have been fortunate enough to find such brilliant scripts at the first place and backed them whole-heartedly,” he added.</p>
      <p>For Ayushmann, <i>“Bala”</i> has taken a very special place in his heart given the film’s positive messaging of self-love to society.</p>
      <p>He added: “I’m thrilled with the appreciation that the film has earned because I take a lot of time to hunt and curate the scripts that I feel is the best to convert into theatrical movies.”</p>
