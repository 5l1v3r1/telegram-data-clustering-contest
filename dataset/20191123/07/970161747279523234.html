      <h1>Frank Warren: Deontay Wilder taking enormous risk against Luis Ortiz</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:07:15+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/frank-warren/" target="_blank">Frank Warren</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tyson-fury/">Tyson Fury</a> isn’t going to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a>’s fight. The ball is well and truly in Wilder’s court, he’s got to deliver.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tyson-fury-deontay-wilder-luis-ortiz-rematch-ben-davison-11180119/">We’ve never considered Luis Ortiz as an opponent for Tyson</a>, but there’s no doubt he did well against Wilder last time out. However, I do think Wilder will stop him this time. Ortiz is a competitor, but I expect Wilder to do a job on him. That’s not to say it’s not a risky fight, because it is – especially because of the timing.</p>
      <p>They kept moaning to us about Fury <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/26/tyson-fury-rubbishes-deontay-wilder-prediction-will-pull-february-rematch-10986361/">having tune-up fights and going on WWE</a>, and then they turn around and schedule this fight for November? Why is he having this fight? Wilder is risking millions of dollars with this fight.</p>

      <p>Tyson has done all the promotional heavy lifting for their rematch. Basically all he’s done since their first fight is make the rematch more lucrative for him and Wilder. Tyson should be charging Wilder promotional fees at this stage. Wilder has built his profile off the back of Tyson. His rivalry with Tyson has been the making of him.</p>

      <p>There’s no such thing as a walkover in boxing, just ask <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anthony-joshua/">Anthony Joshua</a>. We’ve seen it time and time again. If Tyson had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/tyson-fury-confident-cuts-will-hold-wwe-debut-braun-strowman-11002955/">fought Otto Wallin in November and got the cut he did</a>, he wouldn’t have been able to fight on 22 February. If Wilder does get cut or injured, the rematch date will have to be moved.</p>
      <p>As far as the rematch goes, I don’t think Wilder is capable of changing to beat Tyson. He only has one game plan. When he catches you, you’re out – but that’s it. Wilder is the biggest heavyweight puncher in the last 20 years and it’s not like he’s a big lump. He’s loose and he moves quick. He gets leverage so quickly and it’s like a truck hitting you.</p>
      <p>We can expect the same Wilder again, but I do think in the rematch we’ll see the mental marks that Tyson has left on him. We won’t see it against Ortiz, but we will see it when he’s in the ring against Tyson again. Tyson trained to make weight for the first fight. He looks almost ripped now. There’s no ring rust, there’s no fitness concerns – Tyson is in peak condition. Training to make weight drains fighters, but Tyson won’t have to worry about that in the rematch.</p>

      <p>Best case scenario for Saturday night is Wilder knocks out Ortiz in a few rounds. Then we’ll have no concerns about the rematch going ahead. However, the best case scenario for Fury would be for Wilder to have a real tough war and just about come through it. But then the rematch in February would be at risk and no one wants that.</p>
      <p>Tyson <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/tyson-fury-wants-joshua-ruiz-jr-winner-february-deontay-wilder-loses-luiz-ortiz-11147782/">said he wanted to fight the winner of Anthony Joshua vs Andy Ruiz Jr in February if Wilder has to pull out</a>. From my perspective, that’s very unlikely. If Ruiz Jr wins then it’s more likely, but if AJ wins he won’t want anything to do with Tyson. I’ve said that from the beginning and anyone who has half a brain knows that. Fury would box his head off and probably stop him.</p>
      <p>Tyson has three more fights on his contract and his next two will be Wilder. After that, if Matchroom and AJ want to do the fight in the UK, that would be the biggest fight in the history of British boxing. I want Fury to retire as the undisputed champion and I really want him to retire from boxing on his own terms. Give Tyson the option between fighting Wilder and Joshua and he’d always chose AJ.</p>
      <p>Joshua has got to beat Ruiz Jr and then it can be 50/50 split. If he doesn’t beat Ruiz Jr, I still think we can make the fight before Fury retires. If all parties want it, really want it, then it should be straight forward and right down the middle for both fighters.</p>
