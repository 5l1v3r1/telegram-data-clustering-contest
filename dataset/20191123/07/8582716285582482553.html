      <p><b>NAGOYA — </b>Foreign ministers from the Group of 20 major economies on Saturday agreed that they will take the lead in reforming the World Trade Organization, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said, amid a U.S.-China tariff trade war.</p>
      <p>Motegi, the chairman of the two-day G20 foreign ministers gathering in Nagoya, also said at a press conference that ongoing negotiations on a sprawling Asia-Pacific free trade agreement should be concluded by all the original 16 member states even after India opted out.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the foreign ministers discussed reforms to the WTO, as Japan, the United States and other countries are pushing for the Geneva-based organization to improve its dispute settlement system -- a point touched on in a declaration issued by G20 leaders after a summit in Osaka in June.</p>
      <p>Against the backdrop of a tariff trade war between the United States and China, Motegi said during Saturday's gathering, "We should deepen discussions to make concrete efforts" to boost free and fair trade.</p>
      <p>In late June, G20 leaders agreed to promote free trade and committed to using "all policy tools" to support the global economy facing downside risks.</p>
      <p>Motegi also said that the 16-member Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, including Japan and China and India, is an important framework to galvanize free trade across the globe.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, RCEP leaders gave up attaining their goal to seal a pact by the end of the year. India, one of the participants in the trade talks, has been reluctant to lower its trade barriers as it claims to have suffered massive and chronic trade deficits with China for many years.</p>
      <p>The United States is not part of RCEP, which covers a third of the global economy and accounts for half of the world's population.</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did not participate in the G20 meeting, apparently reflecting Washington's lack of interest in multilateral economic and financial policy dialogue.</p>
      <p>In place of Pompeo, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan joined the G20, which represents about 80 percent of the world's economy.</p>
      <p>With U.S. President Donald Trump pursuing protectionist policies as part of an "America First" agenda, the absence of the foreign minister of the world's biggest economy has raised a question as to the significance of the G20 framework, foreign affairs experts say.</p>
      <p>The G-20 consists of 20 of the world's largest economies -- Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United States and the European Union.</p>
      <p>Established in 1999 as a forum on financial stability, this is only the fourth time that a foreign ministers' meeting has been held.</p>
      <p>In addition to G20 members, this year's meeting of foreign ministers was attended by nine other countries, among them Spain, the Netherlands and Thailand.</p>
      <p>The G20 foreign ministers meeting in Nagoya was the last of a series of ministerial gatherings hosted by Japan this year, with the group's rotating presidency next passing to Saudi Arabia.</p>
