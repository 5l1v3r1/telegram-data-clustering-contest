      <h1>The night that will add another edge to the Newcastle United vs Aston Villa rivalry</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce will be hoping to beat former side Aston Villa when he returns to Villa Park on Monday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>It will all come flooding back for Steve Bruce when the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> team bus pulls up outside Villa Park on Monday night. The 5-0 victory against Bristol City, the heat of the Second City derby, the play-off semi-final win against Middlesbrough when home fans invaded the pitch in delirious delight...</p>
      <p>Monday night marks the Magpies head coach's first trip to his old stomping ground since he was sacked by Villa 13 months ago - a day after his final game in charge against Preston North End. The memory of that night is still fresh in the 58-year-old's mind.</p>
      <p>That 3-3 draw sealed <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce's</a> fate with club chiefs following a run of one win in nine league games and before a ball was even kicked that night, a cabbage had been thrown at him by a Villa fan.</p>
      <p>It adds another dimension to an already feisty rivalry between Newcastle and Villa - more than a decade after the 'Who's your messiah? Ant or Dec' and 'Sob on the Tyne' banners were unfurled during the 1-0 defeat that relegated the Magpies at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>While Bruce looks back fondly on his time at Villa - his side were just one win away from promotion in 2018 - he understandably wants to beat his former employers.</p>
      <p>"My last game we were 2-0 up against Preston. Unfortunately, James Chester got sent-off just after half-time," the Newcastle head coach told ChronicleLive. "We then went 3-2 behind. We equalised and made it 3-3 and got a penalty with 10 seconds to go and Glenn Whelan missed.</p>
      <p>"If ever that summed up my time at Aston Villa, that night did but I would like to think when people have a look at it...they had not won away from home after being relegated from the Premier League for 14 months.</p>
      <p>"The club was in a mess and we nearly got there under difficult circumstances. It was very difficult in the end with the finances at the club and it nearly went bust. Without the new owners coming in so quickly, then Aston Villa might not even be Aston Villa. It's incredible.</p>
      <p>"It was a very, very good job. I enjoyed it immensly. A tough one under difficult circumstances and when you get the sack, always, always, you think it's unjust but, look, if [Mauricio] Pochettino can get the sack after what happened then we're all vulnerable because he's one of the most talented young coaches out there. He ended up getting sacked which is quite remarkable."</p>
