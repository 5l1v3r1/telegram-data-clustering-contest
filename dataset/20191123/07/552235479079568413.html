      <p>A Hamilton man who hounded his former partner in Wishaw has been put under supervision for a year.</p>
      <p>Christopher McCully, 37, of Mill Road, was also fined Â£100 at Hamilton Sheriff Court last week.</p>
      <p>He admitted engaging in a course of conduct that caused Laura Petrie fear or alarm between July 7 and 10.</p>
      <p>The court heard McCully sent Ms Petrie recorded messages which were abusive and threatening, and an abusive email.</p>
      <p>He went to Gair Crescent, Wishaw, on a number of occasions on July 10, banged on a door, demanded entry to a house, shouted, swore and made threats.</p>
      <p>McCully also admitted possession of cocaine in Gair Crescent that day, but a charge that he drove dangerously by reversing a car at speed through locked gates was dropped.</p>
