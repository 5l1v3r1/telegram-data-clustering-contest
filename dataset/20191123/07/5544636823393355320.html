      <p>Allen Onyema, the owner of Nigerian airline, Air Peace, has denied allegations of bank and money laundering leveled against him by the United State Justice Department.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that the US government announced the allegations against Onyema on Friday, accusing him of “moving more than $20 million from Nigeria through United States bank accounts in a scheme involving false documents based on the purchase of airplanes.”</p>
      <p>Also, according to a statement from the US Justice Department, Onyema’s Chief of Administration and Finance, Ejiroghene Eghagha, has been charged with bank fraud and committing aggravated identity theft in connection with the scheme.</p>
      <p>However, in a brief statement on Saturday, Onyema denied all the allegations, saying that all the money transfer for the purchase of aircraft passed through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p>
      <p>The Air Peace boss said that his lawyers were working on the allegations which would be refuted.</p>
      <p>“Thank you for reaching out to me. I can confirm to you that all allegations are false and are in no way in line with my character as a person and as a business man whose only aim has been to build Nigeria and improve well-being,” the statement read.</p>
      <p>“As the press statement clearly stated, these are indictments that only contain charges. I am innocent of all charges and the US government will find NO dirt on me because I have never conducted business with any illegalities.</p>
      <p>“Be rest assured that I also have my lawyers on this and these mere allegations will be refuted.</p>
      <p>“I never laundered money in my life, neither have I committed bank fraud anywhere in the world. Every Kobo I transferred to the US for aircraft purchase went through the Central Bank of Nigeria LC regime and all were used for the same purpose. The American companies that received the funds are still in business. I never took a penny from any US bank or Nigerian bank. I am willing to defend my innocence in the US courts.”</p>
