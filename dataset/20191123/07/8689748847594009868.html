      <p>” Ever since I joined the media, I have churned out a lot of talents. But I feel when I become a teacher, I will impact more young people and help them discover themselves and their potentials.”</p>
      <p>When asked why she want to take such a drastic decision, Nana Aba retorted that;</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you just get tired of doing the same thing over and over again. I am tired of living my life for people. I want to finally live for myself and mentor young people away from the camera…that’s why I want to do my PHD so that I can go back to the classroom and share the knowledge I’ve gathered all these years with the young ones.”</p>
      <p>Nana Aba also added that to be in the media has been a childhood dream. She explained that her father was a news reader and he literally forced all of them to watch the news and be updated with current affairs.</p>
      <p>” I would say I was born into the media. This is because my father was a news reader and he forced all of us to watch the news on daily basis. He also made sure I read a book each day to polish my English. So I would say watching my father read the news on daily basis made me fall in love with the media.”</p>
      <p>Nana Aba Anamoah has portrayed herself to be the fearless broadcast Journalist of our time who would not relent in defending the interest of others.<br/>This is reflected in her recent outburst about the incumbent NPP government’s failed promises. She received a lot of backlash from NPP cohorts who were unhappy with her comments. They however apologized after realising their anger was unfounded.</p>
