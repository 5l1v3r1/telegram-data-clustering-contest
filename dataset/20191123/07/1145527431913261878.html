      </p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance is intact, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said on Saturday, hours after his party's legislature unit leader Ajit Pawar joined hands with the BJP to form government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Malik also stated that his party had taken signatures from MLAs for attendance which were later misused.</p>
      <p>Malik said some MLAs were deluded into attending the ceremony in which Pawar took oath as deputy CM, along with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.</p>
      <p>"Many of those MLAs who were deluded into attending the oath taking ceremony met Sharad Pawar saheb and will be present in his Press conference here later today," Malik said.</p>
      <p>"The Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP MLAs are together," Malik told reporters.</p>
