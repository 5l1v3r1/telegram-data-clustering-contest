      <h3>Mark Lawrenson is backing Manchester City to ease to a 2-0 win against Chelsea FC at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</h3>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions suffered a 3-1 loss to league leaders Liverpool FC at Anfield in their last fixture before the international break.</p>
      <p>The Citizens are in fourth place in the Premier League table and nine points adrift of Liverpool FC in their bid to secure the title for the third successive season.</p>
      <p>Manchester City will take on an in-form Chelsea FC team that have won their last six Premier League fixtures under Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will start the Premier League clash a point ahead of title holders Manchester City ahead of their meeting in Saturday’s late kick-off.</p>
      <p>Manchester City were 6-0 winners against Chelsea FC in the last meeting between these two teams at The Etihad last term.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC defender Lawrenson doesn’t expect Manchester City to slump to a rare defeat at home against one of their top-four rivals.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea have won their past six Premier League games and are obviously going extremely well,” Lawrenson told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50490801">BBC Sport</a>.</p>
      <p>“But I would always back Manchester City when they are at home against another big club. They often seem to find an extra gear in them, and they very rarely lose them.</p>
      <p>“There won’t be a repeat of the scoreline from last season, when City won 6-0, but I am still expecting Pep Guardiola’s side to win.”</p>
      <p>Manchester City have won the Premier League title in the last two campaigns to exert their dominance on the English top flight.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are in third place and a point ahead of the defending champions after their 2-0 win against Crystal Palace last time out.</p>
