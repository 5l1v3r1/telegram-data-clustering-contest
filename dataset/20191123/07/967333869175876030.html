      <p>On Friday, model Tahlia Giumelli expressed her elation at the cancellation of a Victoria's Secret fashion show, criticising the show for its unrealistic beauty standards.</p>
      <p>The model, who is the girlfriend of rugby star Tom Burgess, shared a news article about the end of the show on her Instagram commenting “Oh, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201908081076499357-victorias-secret-wexner-epstein-misappropriated-vast-sums-money/">thank god, it's over now</a>”.</p>
      <blockquote>“This makes me so happy! Here's to seeing more attainable, real bodies in lingerie on catwalks rather than a fantasy", argued the lingerie model.</blockquote>
      <p>Giant fashion retailer L Brands, which is the parent company of Victoria's Secret,<a href="https://sputniknews.com/art_living/201911221077376053-victorias-secret-officially-cancels-fashion-show-for-first-time-in-25-years/"> on Thursday confirmed</a> the cancellation of the show. The show was used to promote the company’s products, according to the <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>The company said the decision came as a move to “evolve the marketing” of its brand products and argued that the Victoria's Secret show didn’t<a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201907041076142522-ex-victorias-secret-model-karlie-kloss-says-hard-close-ties-trump-family/"> have a direct impact on sales</a> of its products.</p>
