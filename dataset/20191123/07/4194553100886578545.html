      <h1>Reported Liverpool target Timo Werner is being transformed into the new Roberto Firmino</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:59:42+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Timo Werner says he is becoming a more rounded player under new coach Julian Nagelsmann at RB Leipzig, calling himself more of a â€˜false nineâ€™ in recent comments on his playing position.</p>
      <p>The Germany international has been linked with the Reds a number of times over the last couple of seasons and has a <a href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/2019/08/26/reds-target-timo-werner-signs-new-rb-leipzig-deal-but-his-release-clause-is-very-low/">release clause of just â‚¬30 million,</a> says Bundesliga journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/ManuelVeth/status/1165738710207328256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1165738710207328256&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.empireofthekop.com%2F2019%2F08%2F26%2Freds-target-timo-werner-signs-new-rb-leipzig-deal-but-his-release-clause-is-very-low%2F">Manuel Veth.</a></p>
      <p>As his comments in the tweet below show, cited originally in <a href="https://onefootball.com/en/news/timo-werner-on-robert-lewandowski-hes-in-a-category-that-belongs-to-messi-ronaldo-en-28023016?variable=20191123">One Football,</a> Werner says he has become more like Roberto Firmino since Nagelsmann moved from Hoffenheim, which could make him an even more interesting proposition for the Reds.</p>
      <blockquote>ðŸ‘€ | Timo Werner: "Nagelsmann has said that I wonâ€™t be playing as an out and out striker for him as such, but more of a false 9. It has encouraged me to improve &amp; develop myself, even when we come up against oppositions that sit deep. Heâ€˜s helped me to make better use of space. <a href="https://t.co/Zt9mkHo86o">pic.twitter.com/Zt9mkHo86o<br/></a>â€” LFC Transfer Room (@LFCTransferRoom) <a href="https://twitter.com/LFCTransferRoom/status/1198013266926153735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>Werner could become a long-term replacement for Firmino and if Leipzig are moulding him into a player of that similar kind, Jurgen Klopp is only going to become even more intrigued by the forward.</p>
      <p>At that price, and with an increasingly appropriate skillset for playing at Anfield, we canâ€™t see any reason why the Germany international wonâ€™t be considered a genuine target come next summer.</p>
