      <p>Carlton forward Tayla Harris won the Australian super welterweight title on Friday night after defeating Janay Harding at the Melbourne Pavilion.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old who stood up to online trolls this year when Channel 7 posted a photo of her classic kicking action online and then removed it due to negative comments has become one of the most identifiable figures in AFLW.</p>

      <p>Harris won the bout after being awarded a TKO against Harding during the fourth round of the fight to show her class in both sports.</p>
      <p>Harris has been a dual All-Australian in the AFLW and played in two grand finals in 2017 with the Brisbane Lions and last season with Carlton.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile gun footballer Erin Phillips became the first footballer for 50 years to be awarded the South Australian Sports Star of the Year after playing in her second premiership with the Crows.</p>
      <p>Phillips also won the AFLW MVP a second time but is recovering from a knee reconstruction after suffering the injury during the AFLW grand final at the Adelaide Oval.</p>
