      <p>Myles Stephenson became the first person to come up with a genius hack to help tackle an I'm A Celebrity Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner was prepared for what lay ahead by tying string around his sleeves, hoping it would prevent creepy crawlies infiltrating under his t-shirt.</p>
      <p>It certainly impressed host Ant McPartlin who applauded the idea and said it was the first time in 17 years of the show that someone had thought of the ingenious hack.                                                                                                                  </p>
      <p>The 28-year-old Rak-Su star had been chosen by former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa to help her with a trial at the Snake Hotel.</p>

      <p>While it was slithering snakes rather than thousands of insects that Myles ultimately faced, his actions were still enough for viewers at home to want them to succeed in the trial.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Jacqueline, 27, had previously dismissed her chances of succeeding: "I didn't think it was going to be me.  It's just so much pressure and I don't work well under pressure."</p>
      <p>She was given hope when a letter to the camp announced that she could pick another to help her, with Myles being her instant choice.</p>
      <p>This was Myles first Bushtucker Trial of the series and he was prepared.</p>
      <p>He said before they started: "We're going to aim for the stars and hope for the best."</p>
      <p>At Ol' Dingo Town, the pairing came good as Myles lay in a trunk of snakes while Jacqueline rushed around the snake-infested house for stars and keys, to free him.</p>

      <p>The ten-minute trial came down to the final seconds as Jacqueline freed Myles and they were heading to camp with a full set of stars and meals for all.</p>
      <p>After Myles joked that the snakes were all over him including one in his boxers, Declan Donnelly was quick to joke: "That's one vicious trouser snake."</p>
      <p>The twist in the tale was that Jacqueline and Myles were being sent to the outlaw camp and could decide whether to take the food with them or feed the main camp.</p>
      <p>A quick game of rock, paper, scissors saw them take the food, much to the consternation to the starving campmates at Snake Rock.</p>
