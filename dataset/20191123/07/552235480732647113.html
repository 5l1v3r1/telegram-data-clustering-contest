      <h1>Paul McGinn thanks St Mirren fans for continued backing and insists there's no need to panic</h1>
      <h2>The defender hopes the end of the season won't be as tough on the fans as the last campaign.</h2>

      <p>Experienced defender Paul McGinn hopes <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> fans don’t have to support them through dark days again this season.</p>
      <p>The Buddies faithful stuck by the club through thick and thin last year, never more so than in the nerve-wracking play-off final against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee-united-fc">Dundee United</a>.</p>
      <p>And while McGinn is grateful the Saints supporters are still backing them, he wants the team to step up so they don’t have to watch from behind their hands again at the end of this campaign.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s maybe the performances that are letting us away with it now,” he told Express Sport.</p>
      <p>“It can’t last though. They were brilliant with us last year and knew we were up against it. They got behind us and it was ideal.</p>
      <p>“Fingers crossed they can do that again but hopefully they won’t need to.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully they don’t need to dig in with us and can just come and enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“The performances have been there but we can’t keep saying the same thing. Until we get results then we need them to stick with us.”</p>
      <p>While McGinn struck the winning penalty in that all-important shoot-out with Dundee United to secure their Premiership status, he is hoping the Saints can avoid that situation happening again next summer.</p>
      <p>And even though the Buddies currently sit bottom of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Scottish Premiership</a> table he is confident the squad have enough to quality to quickly turn the tide, especially with two home games in the next four days.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s early doors and we were bottom much later than this last season. We are not panicking. We’d rather be further up the table, don’t get me wrong, but it’s just the fact we have been beaten and then not had a game for two weeks.</p>
      <p>“We have been pretty good at home this season. Only Rangers have beaten us. It seems like forever since we played at home. But I said at the start of the season I would like to make it a place where teams didn’t enjoy coming and so far that’s been the case.</p>
      <p>“Fingers crossed with these two games we can do the same.”</p>
      <p>McGinn doesn’t have to look very far for inspiration, given his brother John scored three goals in two games for Scotland over the international break.</p>
      <p>And he believes the former St Mirren star is a shining example to the rest of the club’s youngsters as to how far talent and hard work can take them.</p>
      <p>He added: “He can’t miss at the moment can he? When you are in that form he can shoot anywhere and it would probably deflect into the net, whereas we have a shot and it would deflect wide.</p>
      <p>“He has momentum behind him. That advanced position suits him down to the ground, he is a clever footballer. People think he is this hustle and bustle player but he is very clever.</p>
      <p>“He has the attributes and knows when to use his bum and when to stick that big head in.</p>
      <p>“John stayed at mine on Tuesday after the Kazakhstan game. He likes to see his wee nephew.</p>
      <p>“I caught him watching the game back and rewatching his goal. I’m sure he had recorded it on my Sky box. He doesn’t watch the bad games back, only the good ones!”</p>
