      <p>Things were smooth for the Shiv Sena till the Bharatiya Janta Party on Saturday pulled a stunner in Maharashtra politics. While Sena was busy canvassing support from the Congress-NCP alliance for form government in the state, a BJP leader said -- "Picture abhi baki hai" (the show is not over yet).</p>
      <p>The statement came from BJP leader Shaina NC just hours before the party's Devendra Fadnavis and NCP's Ajit Pawar took oath as the Maharashtra chief minister and deputy chief minister respectively. She was speaking to India Today TV's Shiv Aroor during a 5 pm debate on his show.</p>
      <p>When asked about the (then) ongoing negotiations between NCP and Congress and Uddhav Thackeray reluctant to be the chief minister, Shaina NC said that it is not over till it's over. "Hold your horses. Picture abhi baki hai. All we want is stability for Maharashtra."</p>
      <p>"They [people of Maharashtra] voted for the BJP as the number one party with 105 MLAs and other with 56, 55 and 54 MLA... Suddenly when you see a khichdi sarkar [by NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena] where you have people coming together only for the lust of power, I think it is doing disservice to the people of Maharashtra. I don't conceive this as the final length. I am hopeful there will be a stable government in Maharashtra... picture abhi baki hai," Shaina NC said.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When Shiv Sena was on the edge of signing pact with the Congress and the NCP, the BJP leader's statement came as a hint to the unprecedented move by the party today.</p>
      <p>The month-long political impasse ended dramatically with BJP's Devendra Fadnavis returning as chief minister of Maharashtra for a second term and NCP leader and party chief Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar taking oath as the deputy chief minister at the Raj Bhavan on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>"People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, following which the President's rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable government not a 'khichdi' government," Devendra Fadnavis said after swearing-in as the chief minister.</p>
      <p>The move came at a time when deliberations between Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena seemingly reached the final stage on Friday. Earlier, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had claimed that there was a consensus on Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister of the alliance government.</p>
