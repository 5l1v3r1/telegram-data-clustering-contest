      <p>It's going to cost more to get a planned outdoor ice rink operating thanks to an act of vandalism.</p>
      <p>Vandals damaged land preparations for an outdoor ice rink at the Silver Creek Community Park, which will delay the project and cost money to repair.</p>
      <p>This project was being undertaken through a donation from Mountainside Earthworks, who are currently completing the new Salmon River Parallel Trail, with materials donated from local area aggregate suppliers.</p>
      <p>Vandals drove an ATV on the prepared soil surface which acts as a base for the ice rink. The tire marks and ruts now have to be repaired before the project can proceed.</p>
      <p>“It is frustrating that someone would do damage like this, especially when we have a project that is being undertaken with community donations. Vandalism like this costs everyone,” says Ryan Nitchie, Team Leader of Community Services.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information regarding who might be responsible for the damage is asked to contact the Salmon Arm RCMP detachment at 250-832-6044.</p>
