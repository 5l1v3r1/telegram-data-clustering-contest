      <h1>Tamra Judge Slams Kelly Dodd Amid Their Explosive Feud – Says She ‘Likes To Destroy’ People</h1>

      <p>It sounds like the drama between Tamra Judge and Kelly Dodd is not even close to ending and that they still have bad things to say about one another. Tamra, in particular, slammed her Real Housewives of Orange County co-star and nemesis during a Q&amp;A session on Instagram, going as far as to say that she ‘likes to destroy’ others when she’s mad!!</p>
      <p>The beef between the two ladies has been in the center of attention whether on the show or off this whole season and it sounds like it will continue to be so!</p>
      <p>As you know, Kelly had a fallout with Tamra, as well as with Vicki Gunvalson and Shannon Beador and she’s been accused of all kinds of things by all of them.</p>
      <p>Now, during a QnA on her platform, Tamra answered a lot of questions about her personal life, revealing some details about her enemy on RHOC as well.</p>
      <p>When a follower wondered who her best friend on the series was, Tamra simply posted a pic of Shannon.</p>
      <p>But that was not all, as she also included the following caption alongside it: ‘And NO I did not talk s**t about Shannon! As we have all seen Kelly likes to destroy when she’s mad.’</p>
      <p>What she was referring to was the fact that Kelly told Shannon about Tamra supposedly gossiping about her.</p>
      <p>More precisely, Kelly stated that Tamra talked about Shannon gaining weight behind her back.</p>
      <p>Shannon was curious to learn if it was true or not so she confronted Tamra but the latter insisted that was not the case.</p>
      <p>Later on, Kelly was also mad with Tamra after finding out that she was the one to mention that ‘train’ rumor first, even though she believed it was Vicki, initially.</p>
      <p>‘I am completely shocked, disappointed, it makes me sick to my stomach that I even trusted this woman,’ she said after learning who it actually was.</p>
