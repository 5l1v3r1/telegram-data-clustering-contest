      <h1>Great news for Mo Salah and Liverpool as Egyptian avoids surgery on ongoing problem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T07:43:36+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 07:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool winger Mo Salah will <i>not</i> undergo surgery on his ongoing injury issue, Jurgen Klopp has confirmed, as per the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-make-decision-mohamed-salah-20938576">Daily Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>His initial injury was sustained by the shocking tackle from Hamza Choudhury in the game against Leicester City at Anfield. Six weeks later, and Salah is still struggling to shake it off.</p>
      <p>It was only exacerbated by the heavy challenge from Fernandinho in the fixture with Manchester City just before the international break which left him hobbling in the second half.</p>
      <p>According to the same report, Salah has been barely able to train in that time, though the Reds feel an operation will not be needed and rather that he will simply need to be managed and rested as much as possible.</p>
      <p>Salah completed a full training session yesterday and will need to be assessed ahead of this afternoon’s trip to Crystal Palace. Even if he came through that without a problem, Klopp may decide that with so many huge games to come, it might be wise not to risk him anyway.</p>
      <p>With a huge game against Napoli to come midweek, which would see the Reds make the Champions League knockout stages with a game to spare with a victory, keeping Salah on the bench at Selhurst Park seems the most likely outcome.</p>
