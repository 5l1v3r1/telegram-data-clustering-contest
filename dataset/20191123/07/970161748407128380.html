      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> has finally addressed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a>’s stint in the I’m A Celebrity jungle, and it turns out she’s loving her on it just as much as we are.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, the 39-year-old quote-tweeted a video showing the moment the Olympian – who was previously married to momager Kris Jenner – gave a motivational speech to the campmates.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old could be seen telling her co-stars: ‘Let’s go team. Not just another day, another day to excel, another day to be great.</p>
      <p>‘Rise and shine!’</p>
      <p>And Kim revealed she had gone the extra mile and set the audio as her alarm.</p>
      <p>‘I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago,’ she told her 62.3million followers.</p>

      <p>Not sure it’s going to catch on quite as much as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/18/kylie-jenner-cashing-viral-meme-releasing-rise-shine-merch-course-10939488/">Kylie Jenner’s Rise and Shine bop</a>, but you do you, hun.</p>

      <p>Kimmy’s tweet marks the first time any member of the famous family has spoken publicly about Caitlyn’s time in Australia, with fans wondering why they were staying so silent.</p>
      <p>But Cait has been <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-begins-spilling-family-secrets-opens-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-11185599/">spilling a fair few nuggets of information</a> about them all to her new best friends.</p>
      <p>In fact, she lifted the lid on her relationship with Kanye West, and took a second to praise Kim’s business sense.</p>

      <p>Lifting the lid on how the mum-of-four got the business bug, she recalled: ‘Kimberly never went to college. The minute she left high school she started businesses. She had her first business out of the closet.’</p>
      <p>‘Kimberly would go into the ladies’ closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet – they’re huge. Beverly Hills ladies. ‘They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberly has an eBay site… Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission.’</p>
      <p>She went on to reveal her thoughts about the Jesus Walks rapper and added: ‘I like Kanye. Kanye was very, very good to me.’</p>
      <p>However, Caitlyn might want to watch just how much tea she spills as she could <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-caitlyn-jenner-face-huge-fines-exposing-kardashian-family-secrets-11194080/">face ‘huge fines’ for exposing all the Kar-Jenner secrets</a>.</p>
