      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a>'s decision to play <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> in a more advanced role for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> "is working a trick", says Sky Sports pundit Charlie Nicholas.</p>
      <p>McGinn has been in great form for Villa in the Premier League this season, scoring three goals in the top flight.</p>
      <p>His form has prompted speculation about a move to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>And speaking ahead of Villa's Premier League clash with Steve Bruce's Newcastle United at Villa Park on Monday night (8pm), Nicholas said: "John McGinn is playing further forward and it is working a trick."</p>
      <p>Nicholas is also predicting a Villa win over their former manager.</p>
      <p>"Aston Villa need to nurture and control leads much better, and at times they leave themselves vulnerable," he added.</p>
      <p>"That being said, I have to admire the way Dean Smith goes about it.</p>
      <p>"Villa is also Bruce's old club and will sit in once again, but Villa will sneak it. There is enough about them to create enough chances."</p>
