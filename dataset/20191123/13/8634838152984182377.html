        <b>Mombasa Governor Ali Hassan Joho has been put on the spot after an image circulated on social media contrasted his lavish life and that of a section of Mombasa residents. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Economist David Ndii tweeted an image of Governor Joho relaxing in his home and that of an impoverished resident. </p>
      <p>"Kenyans don’t need and are not asking for private charity. They are demanding public services they pay taxes for, from public officials who they have elected and are also paid from their taxes," he argued.</p>

      <p>Irate Kenyans expressed their displeasure at the difficult life led by Mombasa residents while their leaders enjoyed the perks of their wealth. </p>
      <p>A Twitter user by the name Rafiki stated the Governor Joho had let down his constituents. </p>
      <p>"Joho has failed Mombasa in terms of real-time visible development. Look at insecurity, poor drainage and poor interior roads in most areas, undeveloped schools, etc. Hassan Joho should do something not just beautifying the city," Rafiki commented.</p>
      <p>While others bashed the governor for living in a lavish mansion while some of his constituents lived in shanties, others defended him. </p>
      <p>"So Joho should live in a '<i>kibanda</i>' until every resident is housed properly? You could literally post the same kind of comparison pic between every governor's home and the poorest of their constituents," a netizen argued. </p>

      <p>Others defended him, reiterating that the governor built his life from scratch and that no offence was intended in making comparisons, but the governor should put more effort to better the lives of his people.</p>
      <p>"For those who are not happy with this comparison, please we are not asking for houses like the one for Joho but we are asking for a decent living, better services and value for our taxes. Nothing more than that." Agoi George explained.</p>
      <p>The image angered Kenyans to the extent of others questioning the essence of quality grades yet they did not amount to better living.</p>

      <p>"On the flipside, Hassan Joho living a high-end life, you and your beautiful certificates and grades A you are wallowing in poverty," Evans weighed in.</p>
      <p>"Yo crazy! You don't know Joho's background, kith and kin! Joho didn't need the education to ply his life and trade. Nobody is demonising Joho's opulence, he's being reminded that leadership is much more than pictures, while your citizens are suffering lack of basic needs." Another Twitter user opined.</p>
