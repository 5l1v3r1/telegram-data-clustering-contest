      <h1>VIDEO: Our N1.1trn budget of olimpotic meristemasis is driven by complex metaphysical realism —Gov Ayade</h1>

      <p>The Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, has said that his N1.1trn 2020 budget estimate tagged, ‘Budget of olimpotic meristemasis,’ is “driven by complex metaphysical realism.”</p>
      <p>Ayade, who has a PhD in Environmental Microbiology, notes that “The budget will catalyse into existence a great opportunity for us all to put our hands and legs on the pedal and hit it off.”</p>
      <p>Suffice to say, in tissue biology, <i>olympic meristematic</i> (rather than ‘olimpotic meristemasis’ as Ayade calls it) cells give rise to various organs of a plant and are responsible for growth.</p>
      <p>“Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells, and leads to increase in length and thickness of the plant,” according to Wikipedia.</p>
