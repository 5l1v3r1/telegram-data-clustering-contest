      <h1>Talking Point: What Are You Playing This Weekend? - Issue 299</h1>
      <h2>Do you want to play a game of lucky hit?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/Quintumply" target="_blank">Stephen Tailby</a></address>
      <p>Next weekend will mark the 300th issue of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/what-are-you-playing">WAYP</a>, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. On the precipice of this impressive milestone, join us as we play some darn video games, won't you? With pretty much all this year's major releases available now ahead of the holidays, we're very interested to see what you're up to.</p>

      <p>One or two games require my attention this weekend as I ready up some more Mini Reviews. However, I'd also really like to put a bit of time into <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/tetris_effect">Tetris Effect</a>, a game I've recently remembered is amazing. Ideally I'd like to get through <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/control">Control</a> as well, but I said that last time and didn't even pop the disc in. Hopefully I get at least that far this weekend.</p>

      <p>The year is all but over in terms of releases, so I’ll be somewhat diving into my backlog this weekend. I plan on playing <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/simulacra">Simulacra</a> for review and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/fallout_new_vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> on my Xbox One.</p>
      <h3>Jacob Hull, Reviewer</h3>
      <p>This weekend I’m an Amazon Prime delivery man. Yep, <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/death_stranding">Death Stranding</a> for me. It’s an odd, self-indulgent game, but I keep coming back for more. With the Premier League back this weekend, I might also jump into some more <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/efootball_pes_2020">eFootball PES 2020</a>.</p>
      <h3>Jamie O'Neill, Reviewer</h3>
      <p>My 2015 Kickstarter order arrived in the week, but it still feels surreal that I own a disc in a box that contains <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shenmue_iii">Shenmue III</a>. I've been waiting until this weekend before opening it, so my plan is to take my time and savour playing this game.</p>
