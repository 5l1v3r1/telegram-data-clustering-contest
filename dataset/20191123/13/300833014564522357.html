      <h3>How to fix Galaxy Note 9 overheating issues</h3>
      <h4>Solution 1: Remove the case</h4>
      <p>If you own a case for your Galaxy Note 9 it is advisable to remove it if you noticed that your device is getting hot. Not all the cases are the quality ones. Some are made from poor materials and can heat up the phone. Once you remove the case, avoid using the phone until it cools off completely.</p>
      <h4>Solution 2: Restart your phone</h4>
      <p>This is the next thing for you to do. A restart can really do miracles. We always point out why – it is because it clears the apps and processes that keep running in the background. It also refreshes the memory that will automatically improve the performance of your device. That is why it is important to restart your phone every once in a while, especially if you noticed the heat.</p>
      <h4>Solution 3: Turn off GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and mobile data when not in use</h4>
      <p>We are dependent on all of the services phones are offering these days. But, the truth is we don’t need them all turned on all the time, right? So, when services such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, and mobile data are not in use, you should turn them off. These services will not only have an impact on the battery life of your phone. They can also raise the heat.</p>
      <h4>Solution 4: Update the apps</h4>
      <p>Another important thing is to keep all of your apps up to date. Developers are constantly improving the apps and every update brings new features, fixes, etc. After each update, the app is working better. What you need to do is head to Play Store and tap on the hamburger icon. Then click on My apps &amp; games, and then tap Update all. This is much easier than to update the apps one by one.</p>
      <h4>Solution 5: Update the software</h4>
      <p>Software updates also bring bug fixes, new features, and more. So whenever there is a fresh version, you should get it. Here are the steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings</li>
        <li>Tap Software updates</li>
        <li>Tap Check for updates</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If there is a new version, follow a few simple on-screen steps to download and install it.</p>
      <h4>Solution 6: Remove the apps you don’t use</h4>
      <p>We tend to keep hundreds of apps on our phones, the apps we don’t actually use. All of them can have an impact on the phone, its battery, performance, etc. So, you should remove the apps you don’t use any longer. You may prevent overheating, and you will also notice better performance and longer battery life.</p>
      <h4>Solution 7: Use the proper charger</h4>
      <p>Some users noticed their devices overheat when charging. You should make sure that you are using the original charger that came with your device. Also, do not keep your device connected to the charger longer that is needed. As soon as your phone is charged, remove the cable.</p>
      <h4>Solution 8: Factory data reset</h4>
      <p>If nothing else seems to be working, it is the time for factory data reset. Going for this option is a bit more complicated because a factory data reset deletes everything the user stores on its phone. So, the most important thing here is to back up all your files. After that, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Settings</li>
        <li>Now go to General Management</li>
        <li>Tap Reset &gt; Factory data reset &gt; Reset</li>
        <li>Next, tap Delete All</li>
        <li>Enter your PIN, pattern, or password if required</li>
        <li>Tap Confirm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let your device finish the process. Once it is done, follow on-screen steps to set it up from scratch.</p>
