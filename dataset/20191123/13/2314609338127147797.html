      <h1>Magmatic and Zoono see Ellis easy winner of Shares Race</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">John Collett</a></address>
      <p>Angie Ellis, of 80-20 Investments, has won the six-week Shares Race by a big margin of almost $13,000, mostly thanks to the outstanding performances Magmatic Resources and Zoono Group.</p>
      <p>Her original $10,000 investment in Magmatic, a gold and copper explorer, ended the competition worth $30,000 – by far the best-performing tip of all.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Her $10,000 investment in Zoono Group, an anti-microbial products company, was almost as good at $29,070 – the second-best performing stock.</p>
      <p>It was an emphatic win by the Melbourne accountant, who has won the Shares Race more times than any other competitor.</p>
      <p>Credit also goes to second-placed Varun Ratra, of the newsletter Eye between Bulls &amp; Bears, who ended the race with a portfolio value of $123,556. His selection of Oncosil Medical – the third-best performer – saw his original $10,000 investment in the medical device company grow to $27,692.</p>
      <p>Dan Silver, co-chief executive of share trading platform Stake, also picked Magmatic and also did well from his stock selection of Michael Hill, with his original $10,000 in the jewellery retailer ending the competition worth $12,105.</p>
      <p>However, Silver was let down by his tip of the worst-performing stock, Botanix Pharmaceuticals, with his original $10,000 in the cannabis pharmaceutical company dropping to just $4,458.</p>
