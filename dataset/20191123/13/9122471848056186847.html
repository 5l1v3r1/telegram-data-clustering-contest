      <h1>Tua Tagovailoa Has Message For Fans Before Today’s Alabama Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:58:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend, the Alabama Crimson Tide were dealt a crucial blow to their team as Tua Tagovailoa went down with a dislocated hip. We’re only a week removed from that injury, but the southpaw signal-caller is already back in Tuscaloosa.</p>
      <p>Alabama has a non-conference matchup today with Western Carolina. It should be a fairly easy test for Nick Saban’s squad.</p>
      <p>Before the Crimson Tide take the field against the Catamounts this afternoon, Tagovailoa went on social media to address the fans that will be present for the school’s senior day.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa shared the following message on his Twitter account:</p>
      <blockquote>“Back in ttown! Thank you all for the prayers and support! Join us tomorrow in support of our seniors and our last home game of the season!!! Roll Tide”</blockquote>
      <p>Clearly, the superstar quarterback will not let his injury affect his mindset this season.</p>
      <p>Even though Alabama will have to battle the rest of the year without him, Tagovailoa plans on supporting his teammates the rest of the way.</p>

      <p>Kickoff is at 12 p.m. ET from Bryant-Denny Stadium.</p>
      <p>We’ll get to see how Mac Jones looks as the full-time starter before Alabama takes on Auburn next Saturday in the Iron Bowl.</p>
      <p>As for Tagovailoa, it’ll be very interesting to see if he declares for the 2020 NFL Draft or stays in school for his senior year.</p>
