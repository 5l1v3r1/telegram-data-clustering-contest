      <p>Kenya’s interior minister says 29 people have been killed in mudslides, among 34 people overall who lost their lives Saturday amid flooding in the East Africa nation.</p>
      <p>Heavy rains unleashed overnight floods in western Kenya. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said 17 people died in a mudslide in the village of Takmal in the Pokot Central district, while 12 others lost their lives in mudslides in the villages of Parua and Tapach in Pokot South.</p>
      <p>West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said five other people died when their car was swept away on the road between Kitale and Lodwar after two rivers overflowed their banks.</p>

      <p>Authorities say heavy rains in western Kenya created overnight floods that have killed 17 people, including 12 people feared buried in a mudslide.</p>
      <p>In West Pokot county, local administrator Joel Bulal said Saturday that 12 people died in a mudslide in the village of Nyarkulian and four people are missing in the village of Parua.</p>
      <p>West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said five other people died when their car was swept away on the road between Kitale and Lodwar after two rivers overflowed their banks.</p>
      <p>More than 1 million people in East Africa have been affected by flooding after higher-than-normal rainfall.</p>
      <p>The International Rescue Committee said this month that many people had been reeling from an earlier severe drought. Now rains in parts of Somalia, South Sudan and Kenya are expected for four to six more weeks.</p>
      <p>Seventeen people died in Takmal in Pokot Central while 12 people lost their lives in Parua and Tapach villages in Pokot south,</p>
      <p>West Pokot County Commissioner Apollo Okello said five other people died when their car was swept away on the road between Kitale and Lodwar after two rivers overflowed their banks. The government deployed military and police helicopters to help the affected families.</p>
      <p>“While rescue and recovery efforts remain the priority, a full assessment into the extent of damage caused continues to be a challenge due to harsh weather conditions,” he said.</p>
