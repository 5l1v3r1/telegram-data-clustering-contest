      <p>Labour have won an extra point in the polls after Jeremy Corbyn’s appearance on Question Time last night.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/conservative-party/">Conservative Party</a> have maintained their 43 per cent lead from yesterday while the Lib Dems remain the third most at 15 points.</p>
      <p>Nigel Farage’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> Party are at four per cent, compared to the Greens at three and all other parties at five, based on an average of polls over the last seven days.</p>
      <p>It comes after Corbyn and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> were grilled by Fiona Bruce and a live audience on the BBC’s election special of Question Time.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader said he would <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-hell-remain-neutral-second-brexit-referendum-11204179/">remain ‘neutral’ in another EU referendum</a> on a ‘credible’ deal negotiated by his would-be government.</p>

        <figcaption>Today’s results come after Corbyn said he would ‘remain neutral’ on another EU referendum (Picture: BBC)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He added: ‘My role and the role of our government will be to ensure that that referendum is held in a fair atmosphere and we will abide by the result of it.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘And I will adopt, as prime minister, if I am at the time, a neutral stance so that I can credibly carry out the results of that to bring communities and country together rather than continuing an endless debate about the EU and Brexit.’</p>
      <p>When quizzed over his radical spending and taxation plans, he said only ‘the biggest businesses will be asked to pay a little more’ in corporation tax, but said the level would be lower than it was in 2010.</p>
      <p>Labour’s proposed £83 billion a year tax hike would include £8.8 billion from a new financial transaction tax, £24 billion from corporation tax, £14 billion on capital gains tax and dividends in line with income tax.</p>

      <p>The rest is expected to come from a second homes tax, a reversal of cuts to inheritance tax, more income tax for people on more than £80,000 and £125,000 , a tax evasion crackdown and VAT on private schools.</p>
      <p>But Institute for Fiscal Studies director warned it is ‘quite doubtful’ Labour would be able to raise the amount they are promising.</p>
      <p>Last night the Prime Minister refused to apologise to the audience when grilled on ‘racist rhetoric’ including his jibe in which he described Muslim women wearing the burqa as ‘letterboxes’.</p>
      <p>He refused to apologise for past comments in which he described black people as ‘flag-waving piccaninnies’ with ‘watermelon smiles’ and gay people as ‘tank-topped bum boys’.</p>

      <p>Johnson was laughed at when he tried to say you can always find things which ‘may look offensive’ out of context but he said he ‘never intended to cause hurt or pain’.</p>
      <p>The PM was also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/boris-johnson-confronted-furious-doctor-nhs-funding-lies-11205035/">confronted by a furious junior doctor</a> who asked why the public should trust that more money is going into the NHS when the service has faces years of cuts.</p>

      <p>Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson denied treating voters as ‘stupid’ over her plans to cancel Brexit altogether by revoking Article 50.</p>
      <p>Audience members tore into her party over changing its stance on fracking, nuclear weapons and backing student fees.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon said she wasn’t so sure that Corbyn wouldn’t allow another Scottish independence referendum in exchange for her political support.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Do you think he’s going to walk away from the chance to end austerity, to protect the NHS, stop Universal Credit, simply because he wants for a couple of years to prevent Scotland having the right to self-determination?</p>
      <p>‘I’m not sure he’s going to compromise the chance to have a Labour government for that issue.’</p>
