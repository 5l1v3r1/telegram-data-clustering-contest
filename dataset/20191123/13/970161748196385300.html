      <p>A man who won the hearts of the nation when he built a giant advent calendar for his wife has turned his romantic idea into a business.</p>
      <p>Ben Hewins <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/12/05/this-guy-made-a-huge-advent-calendar-for-his-wife-with-a-different-present-behind-every-door-6301858/">hit the headlines</a> when a Facebook post about his unique gift went viral.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-two felt under pressure to up his game after being showered with creative presents from his wife Zyleen, and spent days building a 7.5 ft advent calendar complete with 24 gifts.</p>
      <p>After a story in <a href="http://metro.co.uk/">Metro.co.uk</a>, news of his romantic gesture spread across the globe with many hailing the 39-year-old a ‘legend’.</p>
      <p>But Ben’s friends were less than impressed with his valiant efforts to impress his wife.</p>
      <p>Speaking to metro.co.uk he joked: ’They all kind of hate me now.</p>
      <p>‘They keep asking  – how am I meant to top that?’</p>

        <figcaption>After the story featured on Metro.co.uk, ben received messages from around the world asking him to make more (Picture: Ben Hewins)</figcaption>

      <p>Comments like this made Ben, from Illford, quickly realise he was onto something.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Within days of posting pictures of his creation,  people living as far as Australia asked him if  would be making any more – and took to ‘naming and shaming’ their other halves for their unimaginative gift-giving skills.</p>
      <p>Ben said: ’I did not expect the reaction at all.  I only put a couple of pictures on Facebook. A few days later it was on the news in America.</p>
      <p>‘We were overwhelmed with how far the story had travelled and particularly the comments mostly from wives and girlfriends asking why their other halfs had not made them a giant advent calendar.</p>
      <p>‘I had lots of requests from people all over the world asking me to produce a giant advent calendar for them.  It was pretty awesome.</p>
      <p>‘I guess it was those comments and suggestions that inspired us to create our calendars for everyone to enjoy.’</p>

        <figcaption>Ben and Zyleen realised there was a surprisingly high demand for life sized advent calendars and found a manufacturer to create more (Picture: Ben &amp; The Box)</figcaption>

      <p>After taking some time out to go travelling with their kids, Ben and Zyleen began looking into the possibility of making  a business out of giant advent calenders.</p>
      <p>The pair said they initially faced some set backs,  but eventually managed to secure a contract with  a local manufacturer this year – and Ben &amp; The Box was formed.</p>

      <p>Zyleen said: ‘We loved that the calendars could be filled with whatever you wanted. There are so many specific calendars out there like cheese, spirits, beauty, toys, but what if you want it all?’</p>
      <p>While the original calendar was 7ft and made out of wood, this wasn’t practical to reproduce on a large scale and the new calendars will be made out of cardboard in a slightly smaller size range.</p>
      <p>That being said they won’t be easy to hide – one size is 6ft, larger than the averaged size man, while the ‘small size’ towers over Ben and Zyleen’s young children at 4ft 5.</p>

      <p>The advent calendars are available in Ben’s original penguin design, but the range has been expanded for all occasions including New Years, weddings anniversaries and birthdays</p>
      <p>Ben said: ‘We just wanted to create something that will bring people joy and happiness.</p>
      <p>‘What you put in it does not have to be expensive. It can socks and a mug. I would be so excited to wake up to something like that.’</p>
      <p>Zyleen, who said she was ‘amazed’ by the original calendar gifted to her in 2016, added: ‘We had a young daughter and a baby at the time so the fact that he made it for me and not the kids was pretty special.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘The greatest thing about this gesture was that it was a gift that kept giving. I was amazed by the actual calendar but then i got to open a little door each day and recieve a thoughtful gift too.</p>
      <p>‘We are so pleased that we are now able to offer everyone the chance to feel this good’.</p>
