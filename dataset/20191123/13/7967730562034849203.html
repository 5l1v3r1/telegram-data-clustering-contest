      <h1>Activists for life: Tragedy made Peter and Natalie realise ordinary people can change laws</h1>

      <p>Yellow was 23 year-old Sarah Frazer's favourite colour. It was also the colour of a ribbon tied around the aerial of her family's car at her funeral after she died in February 2012. Sarah's car had broken down on the Hume Highway. She and the tow truck driver Geoff Clark who'd gone to her aid were killed by a distracted driver.</p>
      <p>After six years of campaigning, Sarahâ€™s Rule became NSW law in September. It requires drivers to slow down and move over at a car crash, when an emergency service vehicle has lights flashing or if someone has broken down. Her colour, yellow, has also become the colour of a road safety movement "slow down to survive" that's spreading across the world.</p>

      <p>Sarah's father, Peter, quit work to change the law and protect vulnerable road users.</p>
      <p>"We are tiny, we are exhausted and we lack funds," said Mr Frazer of the impact of the past six years. Now the face of road safety, Mr Frazer of Springwood is often the person others call in tears after a road crash.</p>
      <p>His experience has turned him from advocate to lifetime activist. "It is something I will do for the rest of my life. I have realised we can influence change within industry and the community."</p>
      <p>Around the world, dozens of laws or rules have been initiated by the families of victims, often accidental activists who started out trying to protect children. As well as Sarah's rule, there are laws honouring Megan, Dolly, Levi and Morgan, and other children who were bullied, kidnapped, murder or abused.</p>

      <p>Natalie Parker became an activist after the condition attached to a decision to give an embryo to a couple who couldn't have children was broken.</p>
      <p>She had asked that any child born from the donation know its true identity. Ms Parker discovered that the recipient, who had hidden her pregnancy, had given birth to a child - very likely the result of the donated embryo.</p>
      <p>Even though she was an early childhood teacher with no prior legal knowledge, Ms Parker of Sydney's Little Bay said she was motivated by a strong sense of what was right and wrong.</p>
      <p>"My children have a right to know that they have a genetic sibling, and my husband and I have the right to know the outcome of our donation," she said.</p>
      <p>Angry and grieving, she lobbied for amendments to NSW Assisted Reproductive Technology Act, which became law a year ago. They require that details of births, resulting from the donation of an embryo, sperm or ova, are listed on a registry.</p>
      <p>Her own case is now being investigated as a result of the changes she initiated. The Ministry of Health has initiated an inquiry into her case as a result of the amendment she championed, and now has the powers to ask NSW's births, deaths and marriages for information.</p>
      <p>Now lobbying for a federal law or changes to other state laws, Ms Parker's success has made her realise normal people can make a difference. "You can make a change. People who say it is out of our power, it actually isn't. You can be more proactive," she said.</p>
      <p>Sometimes the attention was distressing. After seeing her upset, her seven year old son asked: 'What's the name of the boy who is meant to be in our family who isn't really in our family?' "It just breaks my heart," said Ms Parker.</p>
      <p>"It is very healing to have something worthwhile come out of a tragedy," she said.</p>

      <p>Mr Frazer, his wife Judy and three surviving children met two days after Sarah died. They believed they could make a difference, and realised this was the time to prove it.</p>
      <p>"While we were in grief, in every shape and form, it was time to shape our fate and demonstrate our kindness, including to the driver. He didn't set out to kill two people, but it was a selfish act," said Mr Frazer. "He wasn't a bad person. It was his behaviour that was bad."</p>
      <p>They realised they wanted to change behaviour, not attack individuals.</p>
      <p>At her funeral, the Frazer family sent 23 yellow balloons sailing into the air, and tied a yellow ribbon around their car's aerial to display their sadness. "It was her colour, we had no intention other than that," he said.</p>
      <p>Within days, they noticed yellow ribbons on other cars in the Blue Mountains. A few months later, a fire department's water tanker - decorated with a yellow ribbon - was parked outside NSW's Parliament House when the <a href="http://www.sarahgroup.org.au/">Sarah Group</a> (Safer Australian Roads and Highways) presented a petition.</p>
      <p>"We realised that[the yellow ribbon] was a symbol that could breach a gap," said Mr Frazer.</p>
      <p>Every year in National Road Safety Week, another Sarah initiative, buildings across Australia from the Big Merino to Parkes' water tower, and the Opera House, have been illuminated in yellow. The movement is now spreading overseas to Asia and South America. Mr Frazer is advising international groups, including European Federation for Road Victims, and working with a road safety group in Brazil.</p>

      <p>Other laws that have been changed:</p>
      <p>Amber alerts, used around the world when a child is missing, started in Texas when nine-year-old <a href="https://amber.ny.gov/about">Amber Hagerman</a> was kidnapped and murdered. As a result, hundreds of children have been rescued.</p>
      <p>Dolly's Law was enacted in NSW last November after teenager Amy 'Dolly' Everett took her own life. Parents Tick and Kate Everett launched a social media campaign #DoItForDolly to prevent cyber bullying.</p>
      <p>Megan's Law (USA) requires authorities to alert communities when a known sex offender moves into the neighbourhood. It was enacted when a child of that name was murdered by a neighbour, a sex offender who had served time. A bill to create Daniel's Law, a similar initiative in the memory of child sex offender victim Daniel Morcombe, to create a publicly accessible website stalled in the Northern Territory, and has yet to be enacted.</p>
