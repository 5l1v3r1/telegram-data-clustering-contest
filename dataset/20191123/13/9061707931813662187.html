      <h2>He went to the doctors with a bad back and found out he had terminal cancer</h2>

      <p>The family of a Swadlincote man who travelled the world and won a gold medal thanks to his love of birds have paid tribute to their dad who was "everybody’s friend".</p>
      <p>Charles Adams, who was known by his nickname "Wacker" which he got as a lad, led a colourful life and was loved by many. He died following a two-month battle with leukaemia.</p>
      <p>Now his children have paid tribute to their dad who they say "was always happy and smiling". The tributes came as a memorial event has been organised in his honour.</p>
      <p>Son Mark, 55, said: "Dad was so many things.</p>
      <p>"He was such a family man and he used to foster children with mum. They would have newborns straight from the hospital, he was so caring.</p>
      <p>"Dad was everybody’s friend. He was known to most people as Wacker because when he was a lad he got into a bit of trouble, and someone called him a little Wacker.</p>
      <p>"He was always happy and smiling, never miserable and he would do anything for anyone."</p>
      <p>Mr Adams, who used to work at the old Hepworths pipeworks in Swadlincote, also had another big love in his life - caged birds. Canaries to be exact.</p>
      <p>Mark said: "We all grew up with him having birds, he worked hard at the pipeyards and he needed a hobby. The canaries were that hobby.</p>
      <p>"He had a purpose-made shed and aviary and would have anything up to 100 canaries at a time. He would breed them and use them at shows.</p>
      <p>"Most areas had their own society shows and dad was the president of the<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/watch-voice-star-kirby-frosts-3554339"> South Derbyshire Caged Bird Society</a> so we were all brought up going to shows. That would be our day out whether we liked it or not!"</p>

      <p>Mr Adams was a passionate and dedicated founding member of the Midlands Fife Canary Club and the North of England Fife Canary Club. He committed 50 years to the hobby, both in judging and showing fifes, and travelled the globe showing off his birds.</p>
      <p>Daughter Denise, 52, said: "He was not just well known locally but he was known across Europe as well. He would nip to Holland like we nip to Swad.</p>
      <p>"Everyone who knew dad knew what a massive part of his life the birds were and in 1983 his biggest achievement came when he won a gold medal in the world championships in Italy.</p>
      <p>"He was very passionate about it and while it did take up a lot of his time, he loved it."</p>

      <p>The 77-year-old became ill last year and went to the doctors with what he thought was a bad back, but after being diagnosed with leukaemia he died in hospital surrounded by family, leaving all those who knew him heartbroken, said the family.</p>
      <p>Denise, said: "Every Thursday dad used to have the great grandchildren. He thought the world of them. He would take them to McDonald's, to the park and play football with them. They called it the Thursday Club.</p>
      <p>"On the Saturday he was in the hospital. He only had a bad back, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/happy-healthy-toddler-turned-little-3550193">we never imagined he was so ill.</a></p>
      <p>"He was ill for two months but even in the hospital he was still asking about his birds, laughing with the nurses and giving us orders.</p>
      <p>"We knew he was poorly and it would be an uphill battle but it was really unexpected when he died.</p>

      <p>"He was such a big part of the family. He was the glue that held us together.</p>
      <p>"We saw him every day. Even if it was only for five minutes he would poke his head in."</p>
      <p>The family were inundated with condolences from people all over the world and now a memorial event is being held for Charles at Gresley Old Hall. It will include a bird show when the first Charles Adams Award will be presented in his honour.</p>
      <p>The event which will take place on Sunday, November 24, will include a minute's silence in honour of Mr Adams.</p>
      <p>During the event there will be judging of the birds in 28 categories, with friends of Mr Adams making the trip from Holland and Canada.</p>
      <p>Mark said his dad, who was also a handyman and a gardener, would be "honoured" by the tribute.</p>
      <p>He said: "Dad would have been honoured to have this year’s annual show dedicated to him and also his own award being presented. It is just a shame he won’t be there to see it. <br/><br/>"We are immensely proud of our dad and what a great man he was."</p>
      <p>Mr Adams leaves his partner Bet, three children, six grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren and extended foster family.</p>
