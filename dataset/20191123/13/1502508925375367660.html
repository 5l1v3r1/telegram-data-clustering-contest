      <p>Seven Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislators have pledged their support to party leader Sharad Pawar, hours after they reportedly "rebelled" and backed Ajit Pawar, Maharashtra’s new deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>Dilip Bankar and Manikrao Kokate, who represent Nashik district, tweeted separately to say they were kept in dark about Ajit’s swearing-in ceremony</p>
      <p>The MLAs said they were with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>and expressed solidarity <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar.</a> Earlier, five <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>MLAs Rajendra Shingne (Buldhana), Sandeep Kshirsagar (Beed), Sunil Shelke (Maval), Sunil Bhusara (Vikramgad), Narhari Zirwal (Dindori) and Sunil Tingre (Wadgaon-Sheri) returned to the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ncp">NCP </a>fold after attending the oath-taking ceremony.</p>
      <p>Parli MLA Dhananjay Munde, who also is said to have attended the function at Raj Bhavan, turned up at the ongoing meeting of NCP MLAs convened by the Pawar senior.</p>
      <p>"I have not gone against the party's position. I reached Raj Bhavan after Ajitdada Pawar told me so. Followed order as he is legislature party leader.</p>
      <p>"I had no clue what was going to happen there. I am with the party. I will never change the decision once taken," Kokate tweeted, tagging <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>and MP Supriya Sule.</p>
      <p>Kokate represents Sinnar seat. Bankar, the MLA from Niphad, seconded Kokate and said he had faith in Sharad Pawar's leadership.</p>
      <p>Bankar said he too had reached Raj Bhavan after being told to do so by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar </a>and was "clueless" about what was in store there.</p>
      <p>Earlier, at a press conference addressed by Sharad Pawar, Shingne said, "When I reached Raj Bhavan, I found 8 to 10 MLAs already there. None of us realised why we were brought there. After the swearing-in, we went to meet (Sharad) Pawar saheb," he said.</p>
      <p>"All this happened because of some misunderstanding since <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ajit-pawar">Ajit Pawar </a>had called us," he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sharad-pawar">Sharad Pawar </a>had said that Ajit, by virtue of being the NCP legislature party leader, possessed the list of all the 54 MLAs with names, signatures and constituencies for internal party use.</p>
      <p>"I presume he has submitted that list as a letter of support to the Governor. If this is true, the governor has been misled," he said.</p>
      <p>Pawar also said the MLAs who have defected stand to lose the membership of the Assembly, and when byelections are held, the Congress-NCP-Sena alliance will ensure that they are defeated.</p>
      <p>In the 288-member Assembly, the BJP has 105 MLAs, the Shiv Sena 56, the NCP 54 and the Congress 44. The halfway mark is 145.</p>
