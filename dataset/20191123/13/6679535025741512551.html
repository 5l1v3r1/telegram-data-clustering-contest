      <p>Chief Justice of India (CJI) Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde on Saturday arrived here on a two-day pilgrimage.</p>
      <p>This was his maiden visit to the temple town after his elevation to the top post. He was accompanied by his son Shrinivas and daughter Savitri.</p>
      <p>Mr. Justice Bobde was accorded a warm reception by TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal, and Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy.</p>
      <p>He would be taking part in the ‘Sahasra Deepalankara Seva’ in the evening and later offer prayers at the temple, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Justice Bobde would, however, be extended traditional temple honours when he visits the temple for the second time in the early hours of Sunday.</p>
      <p>Chief Justice of the A.P. High Court Justice J.K. Maheswari accompanied him to the temple town after receiving him at the Tirupati airport.</p>
