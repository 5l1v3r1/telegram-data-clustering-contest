      <p>A legal grow op has been approved for the Shuswap.</p>
      <p>While the area is no stranger to growing pot, this time it is above board with Columbia Shuswap Regional District (CSRD) directors adopting bylaws that will let the grower pursue a federally licensed cannabis production facility.</p>
      <p>The four-hectare grow op is proposed for the Notch Hill area of Electoral Area C.</p>
      <p>The official community plan and zoning amendments were a scaled-back version of the original application to the CSRD, which had called for eight hectares of property to be rezoned for cannabis production.</p>
      <p>As a result of comments received at a well-attended public hearing in September, the applicant opted to reduce the area zoned for cannabis production to four hectares.</p>
      <p>It was felt that reducing the size of the area to be rezoned would allow the CSRD to assess the success of the business in dealing with neighbourhood concerns regarding potential nuisance odours and water use before the board would make a decision on allowing more land to be used for cannabis production.</p>
      <p>Should the business wish to expand beyond the four hectares, another rezoning application would be required. This would include public consultation with area residents prior to any decision-making.</p>
      <p>“I commend the applicant for agreeing to reduce the size of this proposal after hearing from the residents. It suggests to me that they are willing to work on alleviating any concerns and be good neighbours going forward,” said Electoral Area C Director Paul Demenok.</p>
      <p>The reduction to four hectares will still allow the company to operate in existing buildings on the property, with some room for building expansion and the inclusion of infrastructure related to the cannabis production operation. </p>
      <p>The applicant can now move forward with an application to Health Canada for a Cannabis Production License.</p>
