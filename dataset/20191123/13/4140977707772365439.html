          <p>An unwanted match ban would see Bernardo Silva make way for De Bruyne against Chelsea on Saturday. De Bruyne along with Mahrez, Aguero and Sterling look lethal against any lineup on any given day. Chelsea on the other hand, have rejuvenated after the international break.

                            <h3>Predicted Line-up</h3>
                            <p><b>Manchester City:</b> Ederson, Walker, Stones, Fernandinho, Mendy, Rodr, David Silva, De Bruyne, Mahrez, Aguero and Sterling</p>
                            <p><b>Chelsea:</b> Kepa, James, Zouma, Tomori, Emerson, Kovacic, Kante, Willian, Mount, Pulisic and Abraham</p>
                            <h3>Match Details</h3>
                            <p>English Premier League 2019-20</p>
                            <p>Match: Manchester City vs Chelsea</p>
                            <p>Date and Time: 23rd November, Saturday 11:00 PM IST</p>
                            <p>Venue: Etihad Stadium, Manchester</p>
                            <h3>Pivotal Players</h3>
                            <p><b>Manchester City: </b>Mahrez, Aguero and Sterling</p>
                            <p><b>Chelsea:</b> Mount, Pulisic and Abraham</p>
                            <h3>MCI vs CHE Dream11 Goalkeeper</h3>
                            <p>Since there is no clarity if Ederson would start for City today it’s safer to have Kepa in the team. <b>Kepa </b>this season already has had 3 clean sheets for Chelsea and looks pretty confident with a formidable defensive unit.</p>
                            <h3>MCI vs CHE Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>This game is more about Chelsea defenders vs City forwards, with a lethal forward line City would be testing the strong Chelsea defenders. A flurry of goals is expected in this tie, since I predict the scoreline to be in favour of Man City its sensible to go with one Chelsea and two City defenders. <b>Azpilicueta </b>has already assisted two goals for Chelsea on the other hand<b> Stones and Fernandinho</b> have led the defensive units for the hosts this season.</p>
                            <h3>MCI vs CHE Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>In Spite of being in the starting line up De Bruyne has no been in a great form, due to which I have selected <b>D Silva and Rodr and Mahrez</b> whereas <b>Mount </b>with his brilliant performances is an automatic selection. The star studded forward line up is backed up by sheer elegance in the mid-field. D Silva Rodr and Mahrez have collectively scored 5 goals for City, whereas Mount has already netted the ball four times.</p>
                            <h3>MCI vs CHE Dream11 Forwards</h3>
                            <p>The forward line up is the centre of action for this tie. Sterling, Aguero and Abraham being obvious choices with their due to their performances this season; It would be a crime not having either of them in your dream 11.</p>
                            <h3>Captain and Vice Captain</h3>
                            <p>Since I am expecting a score line in favour of City and considering the current form <b>Aguero </b>would be my Vice Captain and <b>Sterling </b>would be the Captain of the team</p>
