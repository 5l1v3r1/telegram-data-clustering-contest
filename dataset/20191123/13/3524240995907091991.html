      <p>Mr Andrew Kumapayi, the Sector Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Anambra Command, who confirmed the death said 10 persons were involved in the accident.</p>

      <p>He said the deceased was a male, while five males and three females sustained injuries.</p>
      <p>“We got a distress call this morning that there was a crash involving two busses about 8.00 a.m. at Enugu-Agidi Junction.</p>
      <p>“One life was lost and nine persons, six males and three females sustained varying degrees of injuries and have been rushed to the hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>“The vehicles involved were a Toyota Hiace bus with registration number USL 463 XB, white in colour, and a Mitsubishi L300 bus marked XC 418 JJJ.</p>
      <p>“The Toyota Hiace bus overloaded with pepper wrongfully overtook a vehicle and ran into another bus head-on,’’ he said.</p>
