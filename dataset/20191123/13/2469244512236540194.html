      <h2>The Take 20 project aims to help some of the 18,000 unpaid carers living in Devon</h2>

      <p>People caring unpaid for loved ones are being offered free online learning to help support them in their daily lives- and ensure they take care of themselves too.</p>
      <p>There are approximately 18,000 people living in Devon who provide essential, unpaid care to family members or friends living with a disability or health condition, who could otherwise not manage alone.</p>
      <p>Take 20, is part of the Devon Digital Carers project, and offers carers bite-sized chunks of learning on topics such as dementia, preventing infections and preparing for a hospital admission.</p>
      <p>The program consists of 20 modules, designed to take no longer than 20 minutes, making it manageable for carers to complete alongside their daily roles.</p>

      <p>Local carer, Anna praised the idea, she said: "The length of the modules was excellent because it was short enough that a carer could fit it in to their caring responsibilities. I also liked the way the course remembered where you are up to so you could go out and it would remember what you'd done and then you could come back and resume. I think this will help a lot of people."</p>
      <p>Lead project manager, Emilie Wiggins, said: "Take 20 is a great way for those interested in taking the course to try it out at a pace that suits their demanding role, without the cost or commitment. We also hope that it will build their confidence by helping them to recognise their existing skills, and even help them to find paid work in the care sector in the future if they wanted to."</p>
      <p>The course doesn't provide a formal, accredited qualification, but aims to give carers a more in-depth knowledge to a range of issues that they may come across in their roles.</p>
