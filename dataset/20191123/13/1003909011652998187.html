      <h1>Chorney-Booth: Sidewalk Citizen's new restaurant blooms in Central Memorial Park</h1>

      <p>Running a restaurant in a park seems like a romantic notion: customers literally stroll in from the pathways and gaze at great space as they eat delicious food. Park life has its challenges though, especially when it comes to the tiny restaurant space in Central Memorial Park. Over the past decade, both the Boxwood Cafe and Provision restaurants opened in the building to great reviews, but for various reasons the spatial limitations and seasonal nature of the location proved difficult.</p>
      <p>Recognizing the issues that irritated its predecessors, Sidewalk Citizen has just opened a new full-service restaurant in the Central Memorial Park building. After giving the space some careful thought, owners Aviv Fried and Michal Lavi have created a beautiful restaurant that appears to be just the right fit.</p>
      <p>The backstory of Sidewalk Citizen, by far Calgary’s most lauded bread bakery, is already the stuff of local legend. Fried and Lavi moved to Calgary from Israel two decades ago — she was a young filmmaker and he was pursing a graduate degree in science. When Fried was offered a lucrative banking job in Toronto, he decided to shift the trajectory of his life, giving up the stresses of the financial sector for the simplicity of baking bread. He taught himself how to make the best sourdough bread imaginable, and about 10 years ago he started delivering loaves of bread by bike. In 2013, Sidewalk Citizen opened its deli counter in Sunnyside Market and in 2015 expanded with a counter-service restaurant inside the East Village’s Simmons Building, which is also home to its baking facilities.</p>

      <p>When word spread that Fried and Lavi would be starting something new in Central Memorial Park, many expected another counter service bakeshop with some sandwiches or pizza, but the couple had other things in mind. The new Sidewalk Citizen is a relaxed sit-down restaurant designed to nourish the community, both literally and metaphorically. Inviting and welcoming (the company is named after urban advocate Jane Jacobs and is largely guided by her example of community building), the space and the menu are designed to provoke conversation and connection.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to think what it meant to have a restaurant in the park,” Lavi says. “When this space became available, we really developed a vision for it.”</p>
      <p>First off, to solve the problem of the tiny space, with the help of design firm Studio North, the existing concrete patio pad was covered and fitted with two fireplaces so that it could be used year-round. Rather than putting up a tent, they erected a dramatic vaulted wooden grid covered with a layer of polycarbonate to let the light shine through. Lavi says it’s supposed to evoke the feeling of being in a snow globe, while still being warm and cosy enough to foster the growth of indoor fig and lemon trees. Combined with the original dining room, this gives Sidewalk Citizen about 90 seats, allowing Lavi and Fried the opportunity to hold community events and potentially expand their very popular Tzavta salon series that they’ve been running at their Simmons location.</p>

      <p>As for the food, chef Colin Metcalfe (who has been working with Sidewalk since almost the beginning) has created an eclectic menu that showcases both Lavi and Fried’s commitment to wholesome and sustainable food, as well as their roots in Israel. Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (as well as the gap hours in between), the menu is filled with vegetable-heavy dishes, lots of fish, and big flavours. There’s plenty of shareable mezze plates like slices of fried halloumi with honey and mint ($7.50), a plate of cucumber and raw barramundi ($11) that is so fresh it tastes more like a salad than ceviche, and larger format dishes like the formidable roasted kabocha squash with chermoula sauce and savoury granola ($17), pan roasted trout with a crispy skin, tahini yogurt and a cucumber and radish salad ($23) and a hummus plate with a soft boiled egg, warm chickpeas and toasted sourdough ($14).</p>
      <p>One other exciting development is that Sidewalk devotees can now enjoy an adult beverage with their meals. The new restaurant offers a handful of local beers, a small selection of wines that pair well with the food offerings, and hand crafted cocktails that reflect many of the flavours of the food. There’s also a nice list of cane sugar-sweetened house juices and mocktails, coffee, and tea.</p>
      <p>And, of course, because community is at the forefront of what Fried and Lavi do, they pay homage to local partners with everything from the paintings on the walls and plates to the spirits in the cocktails. A full list of farmers and producers is listed on the back of all of the menus, with shout-outs to local heroes like Highwood Crossing grains, Leffers Organics vegetables and Deepwater Farms fish.</p>
      <p>The new Sidewalk Citizen restaurant is located at 340 13th Ave. S.W. and can be reached at <a href="http://sidewalkcitizenbakery.com/">sidewalkcitizenbakery.com</a> or 403-263-2999. The restaurant is closed on Mondays, but is open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Tuesdays through Thursdays and Sundays and from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
