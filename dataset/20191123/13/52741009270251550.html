      <p>JAKARTA, Indonesia — A strong and shallow earthquake hit Indonesia’s easternmost Papua region on Saturday, but the epicenter was far from populated areas and there was no risk of a tsunami, officials said.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.1 quake struck at a depth of just 10 kilometres (6 miles). Shallow quakes tend to cause more damage than deeper ones.</p>
      <p>Rahmat Triyono, who heads the earthquake and tsunami centre at Indonesia’s Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency, said there was no risk of a tsunami from the quake and there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.</p>
      <p>He said most residents in the West Papua provincial capital of Manokwari did not feel the quake.</p>
      <p>With a population of around 877,000, West Papua is one of Indonesia's least populous provinces.</p>
      <p>Indonesia, home to more than 260 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions due to its location along the Pacific "Ring of Fire." A powerful Indian Ocean quake and tsunami in 2004 killed a total of 230,000 people in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia.</p>
