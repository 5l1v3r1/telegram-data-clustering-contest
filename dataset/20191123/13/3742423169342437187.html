      <h1>See If You Can Sing As High As Freddie Mercury</h1>

      <p>I thought the office was haunted. The piercing whine of a cat, or a baby, coming through the vents. A machine from the construction outside the window? Oh god, probably a dying mouse in the ceiling. I brought in our deputy editor Alice to listen with me. “I heard that!” she said. She went back to her office; I crept around the rooms of the office. Asked our creative producer Heather if she heard it too. She laughed. Yesterday we’d all been playing <a href="https://vole.wtf/high-notes/">Hit the High Notes</a>, the game where you see how high you can sing. She was trying to beat it.</p>
      <p>Hit the High Notes plays you a tone, and names the famous singer who can sing up to that tone. Then you try to sing it. In my real voice I tap out pretty quickly, only beating Frank Sinatra by a few notes. In a falsetto I can get further, until I’m rasping and squeaking like a mean-spirited Bjork impression. The only way I can match the real high singers is by cheating, and even then I can’t reach the top. Whitney Houston can sing higher than I can whistle.</p>
      <p>This web toy comes from <a href="https://vole.wtf/">VOLE.wtf</a>, a particularly slick and creative time-waster site. When you’re done wrecking your throat, try <a href="https://vole.wtf/high-notes/">kicking the soccer ball back</a> to some cruel British children, in a wonderfully nerve-wracking game. Or for a singing game that’s less like a hearing test and more like a night of very samey karaoke, try YouTube Music’s <a href="https://freddiemeter.withyoutube.com/">FreddieMeter</a>, and try to sing just like Freddie Mercury.</p>
