      <h1>'I fear something worse': Obama adviser on the danger of China and the need to stick by the US</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:15:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Anthony Galloway</a></address>
      <p>Barack Obama's ambassador to the United Nations has urged the Morrison government against "jumping ship" to Beijing in the growing tussle between Australia's security alliance with the United States and economic dependence on China.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive interview with <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> ahead of her visit to Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne this week, Samantha Power also said Australia and other countries needed to do more to condemn China's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.</p>

      <p>Ms Power, who was a senior adviser to President Obama during his first term and served as America's ambassador to the United Nations in the second term, warned any failure by Australia to push back against poor behaviour by China would lead to "more bullying and more intimidation".</p>
      <p>As a university student in 1989, Ms Power watched the "indelible images" of the Chinese Army crushing demonstrations on Tiananmen Square, saying it sparked her desire to pursue a career in human rights.</p>
      <p>At 23 years old, she moved to the Balkans to cover the Bosnian War as a foreign correspondent. She then became an academic and won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for her book <i>A Problem from Hell</i>, which detailed a century of America's inaction in stopping genocides in Armenia, the Holocaust, Rwanda and the Balkans.</p>
      <p>Recruited by Senator Obama to work with him in Congress, she was then made a senior director on the National Security Council.</p>
      <p>Ms Power says she is "very worried about China".</p>
      <p>"There's Hong Kong, and then there's the larger question of how China is going to throw its growing weight around," Ms Power said.</p>
      <p>She said over the Obama years she watched China go from a modest financial contributor to the UN to "becoming the number three financial contributor ... and now it's the number two contributor".</p>
      <p>"With that financial investment comes a much bigger willingness to try to leverage its contribution."</p>
      <p>Ms Power regularly took on China at the UN - including over forced returns of escaped North Koreans and its detention of political prisoners.</p>
      <p>But she also praised China for its handling of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, saying it could be a force for good.</p>
      <p>While she said traditional allies of the US were right to feel President Donald Trump was disengaged from the Asia-Pacific region, the former diplomat stressed "one piece of good news": the situation would be short-lived because the rest of the Republican Party was not supportive of the administration's foreign policy strategy.</p>
      <p>Australian defence and security experts are sceptical of Mr Trump's "America First" policy, which is in sharp contrast to Mr Obama's 2012 "pivot" to Asia. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has recognised Australia will encounter challenges as the US seeks to curb the rise of China but said "you can stand by your friends and you stand by your customers".</p>
      <p>Ms Power said she understood there may be a "temptation to hedge" in navigating the US-China relationship, given America's "current approach to the region and the world".</p>

      <p>Her call to stick with the US-Australia alliance follows a fresh demand by Mr Trump for allies South Korea and Japan to fork out billions of dollars in extra funding for American troops stationed in the two countries.</p>
      <p>"It feels like we're all in the pre-phase of something larger, and my fear has been of something worse," Ms Power said.</p>
      <p>"That's where it's trending this week - of course, with very little US leadership in the face of what China is tempted to do in Hong Kong, but also European governments and others not really united in sending a strong message.</p>
      <p>"We can't forget that democracies have to band together. This is not the time to just jump ship entirely," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Power said it was important Australia remained a "model democracy" in Asia, and this required standing up for free speech on university campuses and making sure all Australian residents were able to speak up for what they believed in.</p>
      <p><i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i> have exposed a handful of <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52ab9.html">Beijing-controlled courses at Australian universities</a>, while <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53b54.html">China critics and Liberal MPs Andrew Hastie and James Paterson were last week banned from visiting the country</a> on a study trip.</p>
      <p>A self-described idealist, she has expressed regret about America not intervening in Syria earlier, when Bashar al-Assad first started using chemical weapons against his people. At the time, she faced calls from prominent commentators in the US to resign in protest over the Obama Administration's inaction.</p>
      <p>Ms Power was regularly depicted as an opponent of the realists in the foreign policy establishment, a dichotomy she rejects.</p>

      <p>She says human rights should not always be in tension with national security: Al-Qaeda used the Bosnian civil war as a training ground for extremism; the Iraqi government's exclusion of Sunnis helped fuel radicalisation, and Assad's atrocities led to a more powerful Islamic State.</p>
      <p>"It turns out that when crimes of this magnitude are happening â€¦ it's pretty rare that other bad things don't come along with that," Ms Power said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Samantha Power will appear at the Australian National University in Canberra on Tuesday, reading from her book <i>Education of an Idealist</i>, published in September.</b>
