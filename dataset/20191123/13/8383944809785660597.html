      <p>A far-right lobbying group known for openly promoting Islamophobia is set to hold a private event on Saturday at U.S. President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, permits obtained by the Washington Post showed.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the Center for Security Policy, a far-right group alleging that Islamic extremists are infiltrating the U.S. government, has been issued a permit to hold a 200-person annual banquet at Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida. The permit was later confirmed by Fred Fleitz, the group's chief executive and a former Trump administration official.</p>
      <p>The Freedom Flame Award Dinner will cost the group $53,000, an amount that will likely go to the Trump Organization.</p>
      <p>The far-right group has long been accused of demonizing Islam and using baseless rhetoric to vilify Muslims in the U.S., thereby fostering a climate of fear. One of the false narratives that the group has pushed previously was the allegation that former U.S. President Barack Obama was a Muslim.<br/><br/>The group also advised the U.S. president against forming a close relationship with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan, citing the latter's having alleged to have forged "too close [a] relationship to Islamist groups."</p>
      <p>One of the group's studies was cited by Trump when he sought to introduce "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States" during his 2015 presidential campaign.</p>
      <p>The White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment on the event, the Post reported.</p>
