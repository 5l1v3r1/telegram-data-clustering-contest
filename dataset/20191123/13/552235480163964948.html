      <p>A musician's legacy has been uncovered following his death after his grieving bandmates found a secret album he’d written while battling mental illness, with help from a Scots rock legend.</p>
      <p>When singer and guitarist, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tributes-pour-ronains-singer-shaun-18983789">Shaun Scott, 27, died</a> on August 19 his loved ones and bandmates from punk pop group The Ronaines were left devastated.</p>
      <p>Weeks after the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/glasgow">Glasgow</a> dad’s tragic death, an album written, performed and produced by Shaun in 2015 was discovered in his aunt’s kitchen drawer.</p>

      <p>Blown away by the 11 tracks and determined to share their late friend’s talent, The Ronains are on a mission to release the record.</p>
      <p>Bass guitarist, Jim Reid told the Record: “The album is called Satellite Tears.</p>
      <p>“Shaun was always so quiet and private.</p>
      <p>“He battled Tourette’s syndrome from a young age but to us he was just Shaun.</p>
      <p>“These songs are like a letter to himself and loved ones about his mental struggles.</p>
      <p>“We couldn’t listen to it all at first because it brought us to tears.</p>
      <p>“But it’s an incredible album that people need to hear.”</p>

      <p>Satellite Tears takes the same name as Shaun, from Glasgow’s previous band with music pals, Liam Byrne and Chris Sweeney.</p>
      <p>Scottish rock legend, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/simpleminds">Gordy Goudie, of Simple Minds fame</a> , helped produce two of the ‘powerful’ tracks.</p>
      <p>The group disbanded in 2016, leaving Satellite Tears gathering dust in a drawer on one disc and one USB stick.</p>
      <p>Jim, along with singer, Debbie Ronain, both from Clydebank, and drummer, Linzi Ronain, from Paisley, want the album out by Christmas.</p>

      <p>All proceeds from record sales will go towards setting up a mental heath charity in Shaun’s name, and his three-year-old son, Jaxson.</p>
      <p>Amidst the shock and grief of losing their friend, the band say Satellite Tears was a “gift from the grave”.</p>
      <p>Jim said: “What’s happened with Shaun and his private struggles is heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>“One of the songs is called Failure To Launch where Shaun sings, ‘son you’re too young too die’.</p>
      <p>“It’s a cry for help.</p>
      <p>“But in a way, this is almost like his parting gift as the music is so beautiful.”</p>
      <p>A secret CD isn’t the only sign Jim believes the Ronain’s were sent surrounding Shaun’s death.</p>

      <p>He said: “Not long before Shaun passed away we recorded the video for our latest track, Fun Time Frankie, which features ex-footballer Frank McAvennie.</p>
      <p>“Shaun always wore black.</p>
      <p>“By chance, the video director wanted to shoot a scene where Shaun was dressed in white, waking as girls surround him.</p>
      <p>“Watching that back now, it’s like he’s walking to heaven.</p>
      <p>“It’s eerie but amazing at the same time.”</p>
