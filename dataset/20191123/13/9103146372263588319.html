      <p> <br/>Bryan White, who has occasionally claimed to be a supporter of President Yoweri Museveni and the NRM party, is famed for his lavish lifestyle and dishing out money to revelers in Kampala. <br/><br/>Bryan White says he inherited riches from his late Italian stepfather Claudio. Claudio was a businessman dealing in real estate. He would buy old houses, renovate them and re-sell them. <br/><br/>Bryan White has confessed having debts, but said if the government can also be indebted, why not him?<br/><br/><b>RELATED STORIES</b><br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1508141/money">Where did they get the money from?</a></b><br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1475375/bryan-white-dpp-hook">How Bryan White went off DPP’s hook</a></b></p>
