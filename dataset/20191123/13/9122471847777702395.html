      <p>Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer has made a habit of wearing some of his football rings on set of FOX’s <i>Big Noon Kickoff</i>. He’s wearing a special one today.</p>
      <p>Meyer and the FOX college football pregame show are in Columbus this afternoon, ahead of today’s Ohio State-Penn State game.</p>
      <p>The former Ohio State head coach is wearing a ring that celebrates his first Buckeyes team.</p>
      <p>‘Wearing the 2012 (Ohio State) undefeated team ring today for (FOX) Big Noon Kickoff,” Meyer tweeted.</p>

      <p>Meyer’s first Ohio State team went undefeated in 2012. The Buckeyes were unable to play in the postseason that year.</p>
      <p>Ohio State is eligible to play in the postseason this year. Ryan Day’s team is widely expected to make the College Football Playoff and contend for a national championship.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes need to get past Penn State first, though.</p>
      <p>Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. E.T. on FOX.</p>
