        <i>Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 3 of The Crown. </i>
      </p>
      <p>The long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/the-crown-season-three-cast-2019/">Season Three of <i>The Cr</i><i>own</i></a> has brought with it a kettle of spicy tea.</p>
      <p>The behind-the-scenes depiction of the British Royal Family has raised many old dramas that have tangled the monarchy for decades.</p>
      <p>The 10 episodes of the meticulously researched Netflix series chronicles the royal events of the 1960s and 70s, including Princess Margaret’s affair with gardener Roddy Llewellyn, <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/princess-anne-and-andrew-parker-bowles/">Prince Charles meeting his now-wife</a> Camilla Parker Bowles for the first time, and palace coverup after a trusted employee was <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/anthony-blunt-the-crown/">found to be a Soviet spy</a>.</p>
      <p>But, exactly how accurate is the series?</p>
      <p>Here, we look at the 4 things <i>The Crown</i> Season 3 got wrong.</p>
      <h3>The Queen crying in public.</h3>
      <p>The third episode of Season Three retells the tragedy of <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/aberfan-disaster/">Aberfan, the Welsh mining disaster</a> that killed 116 children from the Pantaglas Junior High School and 28 adults.</p>
      <p>The episode shows Queen Elizabeth (played by Olivia Colman) deal with the situation in a rather cold-hearted manner. She pretends to wipe away a tear before privately admitting she has to feign her public grief and emotion: “After The Blitz when we visited hospitals, I saw what my parents, the King and Queen, saw. They wept, I couldn’t… When my grandmother, Queen Mary, whom I loved very much, when she died, nothing… I have known for some time there is something wrong with me.”</p>
      <p>However, real images suggest the monarch doesn’t fake her emotion. In fact, the Queen has cried many times in public.</p>

      <h3>Princess Anne's love triangle.</h3>
      <p>In <i>The Crown</i>, it is depicted that Andrew Parker Bowles' respective romantic relationships with the Queen's daughter, Princess Anne, and Camilla Parker Bowles (then Camilla Shand) overlapped. However, the evidence doesn't exactly support this.</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith, author of <i>Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life</i>, explained to <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/prince-charles-camilla-parker-bowles-anne-andrew-the-crown">Vanity Fair</a></i>: "Anne and Andrew started dating in June 1970. Anne and Andrew enjoyed each other’s company but they could never marry because he was a Catholic."</p>
      <p>She continued: "Charles did not meet Camilla until the summer of 1972—long after Andrew and Anne’s romance was over...</p>
      <p>"Charles fell madly in love with Camilla but, to her, it was a fling—he was the Prince of Wales. Meanwhile, Andrew was off in Ireland and Cyprus for six months."</p>
      <h3>The palace conspiracy to break up Camilla and Charles.</h3>
      <p>The Royal family's secret plot to break up Charles and Camilla was another one of the show's scandalous storylines.</p>
      <p>But in reality, “interfering like that is something the Queen would never do,” says Bedell Smith.</p>
      <p>“It was highly unlikely that she [the Queen] even knew about Charles and Camilla... They were sort of under the radar. The only one who really knew about it was [Charles’s great-uncle] Lord Mountbatten, and he promoted it.</p>
      <p>"He invited them to Broadlands together. But the idea that the Queen and the Queen Mother would conspire like that is laughable."</p>
      <h3>Prince Margaret's trip to America.</h3>

      <p>In the second episode, Princess Margaret takes a trip to America in 1965 on the Queen's behalf, supposedly to help secure a financial bailout from U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>
      <p><i>The Crown </i>shows Princess Margaret effortlessly charm the President (with dirty limericks and an alcohol-fuelled party) and depart successful in her request, leading to a wealth of public support in both countries.</p>
      <p>But this is not true. While she did attend a raucous party at the Whitehouse, Princess Margaret's U.S. visit wasn't tied to any financial dispute, and almost all reports say she was not well-received by the public. In fact, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4189787/Jet-set-friends-got-Princess-Margaret-barred-from-US.html">according to the Telegraph,</a> she was "barred by British diplomats from making an official visit to America in the early 1970s because of the wild behaviour of her entourage during an earlier visit".</p>
