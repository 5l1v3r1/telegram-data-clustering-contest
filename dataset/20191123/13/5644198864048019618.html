      <p>MELBOURNE: Australia on Saturday (Nov 23) said it would provide a loan of US$300 million as direct budget assistance for the Pacific island of Papua New Guinea and aid its economic reforms and government financing.</p>
      <p>Australia's ties with PNG and other small, developing countries in the Pacific have gained significance as China expands its influence in a region dominated by the United States and its allies since World War Two.</p>

      <p>Though rich in natural gas, crude oil, gold and copper, among other commodities, PNG has seen its revenues hit in recent years by a downturn in global commodity prices, and has increasingly turned to China for financing.</p>
      <p>"This assistance reflects the Australian national interest in a stable and prosperous Papua New Guinea," Alex Hawke, Australia's minister for international development and the Pacific, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"It builds on our two countries' strong economic partnership, which includes support for economic reform," he said.</p>
      <p>"It will also benefit Papua New Guinean and Australian businesses by increasing the availability of foreign exchange in the country and by supporting trade and investment."</p>
      <p>In August, PNG said it was seeking to refinance its entire government debt, turning to Beijing for help.</p>
