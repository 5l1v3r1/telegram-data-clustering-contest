      <h1>Maharashtra midnight stunner and day of political drama: All that happened in last 24 hours</h1>
      <h2>Saturday was an action-packed day in Maharashtra politics as the BJP managed to rope-in NCP's Ajit Pawar and a letter than pledged support of 54 NCP MLAs. But the battle for Maharashtra is far from over. Read on to find why.</h2>

      <p>When people in Maharashtra went to sleep last night, they knew Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray was likely to be their next chief minister with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress supporting him. Uddhav too must have retired for the day in this hope. After all, after days of hectic parleys his party was on the verge of ironing out an agreement with the Congress and NCP, an agreement that would pave the way for government formation with Shiv Sena at the helm, and more importantly, the BJP out of power.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the three parties were to meet again and finalise their deal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BUT...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hidden under the cloud of these talks was another deal taking shape, albeit with utmost secrecy.</p>
      <p>It all started on Friday afternoon. While the entire media's focus was on Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, Ajit Pawar, NCP chief Sharad Pawar's nephew, approached Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari in Mumbai with signed letters from all 54 of NCP's winning candidates in the Maharashtra assembly elections, extending his support to Devendra Fadnavis and the BJP.</p>
      <p>News of this letter of support being delivered to Governor Koshiyari remained a secret for nearly 20 hours.</p>
      <p>Later that night, BJP's Devendra Fadnavis quietly met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and staked claim to form government, along with the support of 54 of NCP's MLAs, 15 others and, of course, the BJP.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CAUGHT BY SURPRISE</b>
      </p>
      <p>As Mumbai slept peacefully, the action swiftly shifted to New Delhi. Around midnight, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari informed the Centre, and through it the Rashtrapati Bhawan, of the latest developments in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>At 5.47am on Saturday, the Centre lifted the President's rule that had been imposed in Maharashtra on November 12 when no party had been able to stake claim to government formation.</p>
      <p>This decision was apparently taken without a Cabinet meeting. Quoting sources, news agency PTI reported that the Prime Minister invoked Rule 12 of government's transaction of business to go ahead with this decision. The rule gives the PM special powers to bypass the need for Union cabinet's recommendation.</p>
      <p>At 5.47am when President's Rule was lifted, no one knew about it. Headlines in the Saturday edition of most newspapers announced that Uddhav Thackeray was set to become Maharashtra's chief minister.</p>
      <p>But around 7.30 am, news flashed saying Devendra Fadnavis had taken oath as Maharashtra's chief minister at the Raj Bhawan in Mumbai. Not just this, NCP's Ajit Pawar too had taken oath as the deputy chief minister. Ajit Pawar had managed to ensure that 10-12 NCP MLAs attended his oath-taking ceremony.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>At first, for many this appeared unbelievable. But soon the confusion petered and it became clear that the BJP had outsmarted Uddhav Thackeray and company.</p>
      <p>It had managed to rope in NCP president Sharad Pawar's nephew Ajit Pawar and secured a letter of support from him.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar had recently been elected as NCP's legislative party leader in the Maharashtra assembly. Sources have told India Today TV that while his uncle Sharad Pawar was ironing a deal with the Shiv Sena and the Congress, Ajit Pawar prepared a letter of support that had signs of all 54 NCP MLAs.</p>
      <p>This letter was apparently to be used to ink the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance. Sources said it had been prepared in advance and had two blank spaces-one for the name of the party that the NCP would be supporting and the other for the name of the chief minister.</p>
      <p>The NCP has now alleged that Ajit Pawar misused this letter to extend support to the BJP by filling the blank spaces in the signed letter without consulting NCP MLAs and party president Sharad Pawar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>STRUGGLING TO COME TO TERMS</b>
      </p>
      <p>In his first response to this development early Saturday morning, Sharad Pawar distanced himself from his nephew. In a tweet he said Ajit Pawar has taken the decision in his individual capacity and that the NCP doesn't endorse it.</p>
      <p>Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule said the family and the party stood divided.</p>
      <p>Gathering what had happened, senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut hit out at the BJP calling Devendra Fadnavis a man hungry for power and Ajit Pawar a betrayer.</p>
      <p>But all this was too late. The oaths had been taken and the NCP, Shiv Sena and Congress have to fight the battle on the floor of the House.</p>
      <p>When exactly? We are yet to know.</p>
      <p>Later in the day, Shiv Sena Chief Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar addressed a joint press conference in Mumbai. Sharad Pawar reiterated that he and his party has nothing to do with Ajit Pawar's decision.</p>
      <p>"The NCP is strongly opposed to forming any government with the BJP. NCP's alliance with the Shiv Sena and the Congress remains intact," he said.</p>
      <p>The septuagenarian, who fought a tough battle to retain his party's command in Maharashtra during the recent assembly elections, warned NCP MLAs supporting Ajit Pawar that if they switched sides, they would be inviting action under the anti-defection law.</p>
      <p>"Only 10-12 MLAs are with Ajit Pawar. Most NCP MLAs are with me," Sharad Pawar said.</p>
      <p>In its separate press conference, Congress said Governor Koshiyari's decision to administer oath to Devendra Fadnavis will be remembered as a black day in Maharashtra's politics.</p>
      <p>"The BJP has crossed all levels of shamelessness," senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel said.</p>
      <p>At 4.30 pm, Sharad Pawar was scheduled to chair a meeting with NCP MLAs in Mumbai. The meeting was delayed as many MLAs turned late. It was called to decide on the party's future course of action and whether Ajit Pawar should be expelled for anti-party activities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BATTLE MOVES TO SUPREME COURT</b>
      </p>
      <p>The battle for government formation in Maharashtra is now being fought on two fronts -- i the political circles of Maharashtra and the courtrooms of the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The three parties - the Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP - have approached the Supreme Court and filed writ petitions urging the court to hear their matter.</p>
      <p>In his press conference in Mumbai, Congress leader Ahmed Patel had said the party will explore "all legal and political" options to defeat the BJP in the floor test.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned as the political hotchpotch in Maharashtra is far from over. In fact, it appears to have just started.</p>
