      <p>Nov. 23 (UPI) -- Comedians <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Stephen_Fry/?tps=1">Stephen Fry</a> and Lenny Henry are set to guest star on the 2020 season premiere of the British sci-fi series <i>Doctor Who</i>.</p>
      <p>The BBC announced the actors' casting Friday, but did not reveal details about the characters they will play.</p>
      <p>This will be Jodie Whittaker's second season playing the titular Time Lord. Also returning for the new season are Tosin Cole, Mandip Gill and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bradley/?tps=1">Bradley</a> Walsh.</p>
      <p>"Short of being picked for a British space exploration program and I readily concede that I'm past the age where I'd be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) -- then being in an episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement," Fry said in a press release.</p>
      <p>"It was absolutely brilliant to be welcomed into the fantastical world of <i>Doctor Who</i>. The nearest I have been to the TARDIS was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in the <i>Lenny Henry Show,</i> so as a life-long [hiding behind the sofa type] <i>Doctor Who</i> fan this is a very special moment for me," Henry added.</p>
