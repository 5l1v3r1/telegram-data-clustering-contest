        <b>Sir Alex Ferguson has finally broken his silence on Manchester United’s ongoing run of poor form, admitting that United are indeed going through a “challenging” spell under their manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Upon asked what the future holds for Manchester United, Ferguson told their official website: “Well, we’ve got a great structure at the club.”</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a lot of good young players coming through, that’s never changed.”</p>
      <p>“There’s always that challenge, and what’s happening at the moment is a challenge, but with a bit of luck – and a bit of perseverance – we’ll sort it out.”</p>
      <p>“The young players at United are doing well. It’s a good set up at Manchester United,” he further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“For any young kid going there, it’s a great club to go to. And I think England are producing great young players who are representing their country and that can only be a good thing. Hopefully, Scotland can follow that!”</p>
      <p>The Red Devils had a very poor start to the ongoing 2019-20 season and at one stage, they were at the 14th place on the Premier League table – just two points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Right now, they are at the eighth place, with 16 points from 12 matches, and will travel to the Bramall Lane to play against Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
