      <h2>Do you think the vehicle pictured here reminds you of the Mustang Steve McQueen drove in his classic movie Bullitt?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:13:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thecourier.co.uk/author/jackmckeown/" target="_blank">Jack McKeown</a></address>
      <p>Ford certainly hopes so, having launched an electric SUV version of the iconic muscle car. This is the all-electric Mustang Mach-E – Ford’s rival to the Tesla Model X and Jaguar I-Pace.</p>
      <p>An all-new, purpose-built vehicle, the Mach-E is one of 14 electrified Ford vehicles due to come to Europe by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The launch model will pack 332bhp, while a more powerful 459bhp GT version is due to arrive at a later date.</p>
      <p>It’ll be launched initially with two battery-pack sizes and three power outputs. At the entry point of the range sits a single motor-driven version with either a 75kWh battery and a 245bhp motor or a 99kWh battery and a 285bhp motor. Both should hit 60mph in under eight seconds, while ranges of 280 miles and 370 miles should be possible from each respective powertrains.</p>
      <p>Further up in the range sits a twin-motor all-wheel-drive version with the choice of either a 75kWh battery and 245bhp, or a 99kWh battery and 332bhp. Both versions should go from 0-60mph in under seven seconds while returning claimed ranges of 260 and 335 miles.</p>
      <p>Bill Ford, Ford Motor Company executive chairman, said: “At the first-ever Detroit auto show, Henry Ford said he was working on something that would strike like forked lightning.</p>
      <p>“That was the Model T. Today, the Ford Motor Company is proud to unveil a car that strikes like forked lightning all over again. The all-new, all-electric, Mustang Mach-E. It’s fast. It’s fun. It’s freedom. For a new generation of Mustang owners.”</p>
      <p>Inside, the Mach-E benefits from a 15.5-inch infotainment screen with touch, swipe and pinch controls which, Ford state that ‘every smartphone owner will be comfortable using’.</p>
      <p>First deliveries are expected to commence in October next year, with prices likely to start around £40,000.</p>
