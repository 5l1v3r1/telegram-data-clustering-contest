        <figcaption>HIT: Styled by celebrity stylist Ami Patel, Ananya Panday was seen in a floral printed short dress from the label Alice McCALL. The satin dress looked nice on the actor but the overall look was a bit bland. It was rounded out with minimal make-up, heels from Public Desire, and was kept low on accessories.

        <figcaption>HIT: Styled by celebrity stylists Ami Patel and Sanjay Kumar Dhauliya, Athiya Shetty donned a purple handwoven silk brocade blouse which was teamed with a white silk brocade lehenga and a matching silk organza dupatta. We really liked the purple and gold combination. The look was accessorised with a statement neckpiece from Amrapali Jewels, and was rounded out with kajal and a dark shade of lipstick. The look was understated and yet makes for a perfect outfit for any wedding. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>MISS: Bhumi Pednekar, who is busy promoting her upcoming film, Pati Patni Aur Woh, was seen in a sequin top that we just could not wrap our head around. The bralette with purple and black sequin work grabbed eyeballs, but only for being too gaudy. The ruffle detailing around the hem of the top, which was paired with black jeans, was the major reason that put us off. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>MISS: Jacqueline Fernandez too was spotted wearing black. The Kick actor was seen in a sheer black outfit with a yellow layer underneath, and there was nothing that went right with the look. It was ill-fitted, and even the way it was accessorised —pearl bracelet and a black and gold sling bag — failed to make any mark. The actor is generally on point with her fashion choices so this is quite baffling. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: The Veere Di Wedding actor Kareena Kapoor Khan was spotted in a light yellow dress from the label Dion Lee. Styled by Rhea Kapoor, the outfit was risque and chic and we loved the diamond-like cut out at the waist which not only gave an interesting twist to the whole look but also elevated it. The look was rounded out with stilettos from Fenty and accessorised with hoop earrings and chunky diamond rings. Kajal and messy hairdo completed the look. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: Karisma Kapoor was seen looking resplendent in a full-sleeved printed kurta set from ace designer Anita Dongre at an event in Kolkata. Printed ethnics are in vogue at the moment, and we like the way celebrity stylist Eshaa Amiin teamed the ensemble with mirror work juttis from Fizzy Goblet and statement chandbalis. For hair and makeup, Kapoor mixed things up with a voluminous fishtail braid, a bold red lip and a hint of blue eye shadow that added a pop of colour to her look. (Source: Instagram)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: The Kabir Singh actor Kiara Advani was seen wearing a one-sleeved light pink scrunched up short dress that looked lovely on her. The look was rounded out with a light shade of lipstick and filled-in eyebrows. The elaborate sleeve made the look stand out and we quite liked how it was kept understated and was accessorised with rings. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: Parineeti Chopra too was spotted in black. The actor was seen in a rather sombre look as she went for a full-sleeved long black dress. And while the cuts of the dress work fine, the way it was accessorised with the colourful shades completely changed the tone of the look. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>HIT: Shilpa Shetty Kundra was recently spotted in a black strappy top and track pants. And while the already well turned out actor made the right choice with the top, the pants that could rival a galaxy with its sheen dampened the look completely. A simple pair of blue jeans could have made the look a lot classier. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>MISS: Taapsee Pannu attended the success bash for her latest release, Saand Ki Aankh. The actor who usually impresses with her fashion choices, disappointed us sorely in her ensemble. Sequins have been big for a while now and it was no surprise that the actor went for it, but her multi-hued one-sleeved crop top just did not work. There were far too many colours on the top and the result was jarring. The look was completed with a choker and black pants. (Source: Varinder Chawla)</figcaption>
