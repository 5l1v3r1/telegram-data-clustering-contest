      <p>The Shiv Sena, Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) filed in a petition in the Supreme Court on Saturday, against the "arbitrary and malafide actions/decisions" of Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari in swearing-in Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister.</p>
      <p>In the plea, the three parties have alleged that the Maharashtra Governor's invite to BJP's Devendra Fadnavis to form the government and the oath-taking ceremony was illegal. The Shiv Sena, Congress and the NCP are now waiting for a response from the registrar if the petition could be heard.</p>
      <p>The month-long political impasse in Maharashtra ended dramatically on Saturday morning with Devendra Fadnavis returning as the chief minister, backed by NCP's Ajit Pawar who was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari administered the oath at the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai at around 7.30 am.</p>
      <p>Hours after Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar took the oath, Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the two taking oath as the chief minister and deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, respectively.</p>
