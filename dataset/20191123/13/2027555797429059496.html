      <h1>Prakash Jha promotes film 'Pagalpanti, at IFFI</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:09:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/roshan-h-nair" target="_blank">Roshan H Nair</a></address>
      <p>In contrast to the screenings and conversations dedicated to covering the more ambitious cinema from around the world, some sessions have been given to commercial filmmakers to promote their film.</p>
      <p>On Friday, the day of release of Anil Kapoor and Anees Bazmee’s 'Pagalpanti', the filmmaker-actor duo were given a session at the Kala Academy here.</p>
      <p>Prakash Jha and Adil Hussain were here, too. DH caught up with Jha for an interview:<br/> <br/><b>Could you tell us about your association with IFFI?</b></p>
      <p>I have been making films for a long time and several of my early films have come to IFFI. It has grown and it has become a big festival, probably the biggest festival in Asia.<br/> <br/><b>Is the recent IFFI any different?</b></p>
      <p>In recent years I have come here, it has been like this. And I have not really gone around and seen, but I see the buzz of people who come to sessions. I just finished a session. These are people from all over the country, I hear.</p>
      <p> <br/><b>Do you not watch as many films at festivals anymore?</b></p>
      <p>There's a paucity of time and all that. I will only be here for a day for the screening of my film and I will be leaving tomorrow. But some wonderful films are being screened here and I am sure I will get to see them.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you tell us about your film here, 'Pareeksha'?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's a very emotional film about the education of an underprivileged child. Father is a rickshaw puller who takes kids to a big school every day. He wants his child to get the same education. Because education is the only way to bridge the gap between different sections of society.</p>
