      <h1>'Drowned out by corporate interests': Mardi Gras under fire over drug sponsor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Taylor</a></address>
      <p>Sydney’s gay and lesbian Mardi Gras has been accused of accepting sponsorship money from a drug company that a protest group claims encourages the spread of HIV in the US.</p>
      <p>Pride in Protest lead candidate Charlie Murphy, who is seeking election to the Mardi Gras board, accused drug manufacturer Gilead of setting the price for HIV prevention drugs so high that it was "inaccessible to most LGBTQI Americans".</p>

      <p>Earlier this month, the Trump administration commenced legal action against Gilead, claiming the firm had infringed government patents and profited from research funded by American taxpayers.</p>
      <p>"In 2019, Mardi Gras gladly took their money and allowed themselves to be a PR mouthpiece for them – a company that is happy to profit off and encourage the continued spread of HIV in US communities," Ms Murphy said in a speech posted on the protest group’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PrideInProtest/">Facebook page</a>.</p>
      <p>A Gilead spokeswoman said that claim was invalid. "Gilead is a company grounded by a desire to help patients in need, researching, developing and delivering life-saving therapies in HIV," she said.</p>
      <p>Mardi Gras will vote on whether to condemn Gilead for "price-gouging" in the US, as well as whether to disinvite Prime Minister Scott Morrison from the 2020 Mardi Gras, at its annual general meeting on November 30.</p>
      <p>The motion moved by Pride in Protest also asks the Mardi Gras board to condemn other major sponsors Qantas and ANZ.</p>

      <p>The Mardi Gras board declined to answer questions about Gilead's sponsorship of the event, but issued a statement that said: "This year's AGM will consider motions on everything from the pricing of membership to political issues."</p>
      <p>Mardi Gras and Gilead both declined to reveal how much money the drug company provides in sponsorship. Mardi Gras' <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d66w1tjf8liz04j/MG19_AnnualReport.pdf">2019 annual report</a> said the organisation received $3.1 million from government and corporate sponsors.</p>

      <p>Gilead has earned billions of dollars from the sale of its Truvada drug, which is used as part of a HIV prevention strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/gilead-ceo-insists-federal-government-patent-for-hiv-prevention-pill-truvada-is-invalid/2019/05/16/7c0a79b6-77e1-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html">Gilead has attracted criticism</a> for the high cost of the drug in the US. In May, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported Gilead's HIV drug cost between $US1,600 and $US2,000 a month. But Gilead's spokeswoman said the actual cost to US patients was up to $35 a month.</p>
      <p>In Australia, the drug is listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which dictates its cost to patients.</p>
      <p>The drug company was also donating up to 2.4 million bottles of HIV prevention medication each year to people without insurance over the next decade, the spokeswoman said.</p>

      <p>"Gilead do believe it is reasonable for the Mardi Gras board to raise questions about the ethics of sponsors and to use these facts to inform a balanced view," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy is one of four Pride in Protest candidates seeking election to the Mardi Gras board, which will also be held on November 30.</p>
      <p>The left-wing protest group <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p50bz9.html">attracted controversy last year</a> for advocating the banning of the Liberal Party and police from the Mardi Gras parade as well as criticising major sponsors Qantas and ANZ.</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy said the protest group believed Mardi Gras should return to its political roots.</p>
      <p>"We believe that the protest roots of a community event like Mardi Gras are being drowned out by corporate interests and that we need to be more willing to take a stand against bigoted institutions like the Liberal party and the police," she said.</p>
      <p>Another candidate, Louis Hudson, expressed concern about the controversial protest group, which he said mounted the same attack on Mardi Gras year after year.</p>
      <p>He said Mardi Gras would struggle to exist without corporate sponsorship, but added "there's no denying that Gilead's price on Truvada in the United States is extortionate".</p>
