      <p>The 19-year-old has emerged on the radar of several top clubs after netting 26 goals in all competitions since August.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-utd-madrid-quoted-gbp85m-for-haaland_379504.html">Reports have suggested</a> that United, who are in the market for a striker, lead the race to sign Haaland, but will need to shell out £85m for his services.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Bild</i>, Leipzig will have the chance to sign Haaland for just £25.7m as an incentive to keep the player within the Red Bull franchise.</p>
      <p>The two clubs have an established working relationship, doing deals for the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dayot-upamecano/"><b>Dayot Upamecano</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/amadou-haidara/"><b>Amadou Haidara</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/naby-keita/"><b>Naby Keita</b></a> in the past.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that Haaland's father, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alf-inge-haaland/"><b>Alf-Inge Haaland</b></a>, would prefer to see his son remain in Germany as opposed to completing a transfer to England or Spain.</p>
