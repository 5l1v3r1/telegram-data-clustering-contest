      <h1>ESPN’s Kirk Herbstreit Names College Football’s Best 1-Loss Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:40:47+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Three undefeated teams are the frontrunners for the College Football Playoff right now – LSU, Ohio State and Clemson. If all of those teams win out, they will be the top three seeds in the postseason.</p>
      <p>The No. 4 spot is probably going to go to a one-loss team. There are several of them competing for that final spot.</p>
      <p>ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit was asked to name his top one-loss team right now. He’s going with a team out of the SEC. It’s not Alabama, though.</p>
      <p>“I think you’ve got to give Georgia the nod right now,” Herbstreit said.</p>
      <p>Georgia is ranked No. 4 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings. Some, though, would give the nod to Alabama or Oregon.</p>
      <p>Herbstreit added that if Georgia loses to LSU in the SEC Championship Game, it’ll open the door for someone else, namely the Pac-12 champion.</p>
      <p>“If they end up losing the game, it opens up the discussion for the Big 12 champ, the Pac-12 champ and Alabama,” he said.</p>
      <p>The ESPN college football analyst said he would probably give the nod to the Pac-12 champion in that case. Oregon and Utah both have one loss heading into the regular season’s final weeks.</p>
