      <h3>The A-League rivalry between Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory suddenly burst into life with two minutes of absolute madness around the hour mark.</h3>
      <p>Two quickfire goals were scored at opposite ends of the pitch after Reds defender Michael Maria cancelled out Ola Toivonen’s equaliser — the score officially being level for less than a minute.</p>

      <p>With the Reds leading courtesy of a first half goal from Riley McGree, Marco Kurz’s Melbourne Victory came out for the second half firing and finally found the back of the net thanks to a trademark Toivonen goal.</p>
      <p>But before the visitors could get a chance to breathe and reset, Adelaide were charging towards Lawrence Thomas’ goal in the hope of restoring their lead.</p>
      <p>From the resulting kick-off, the Reds stormed down the other end of the field and linked up superbly to find Maria in uncharted territory staring at the opposition goal with the ball at his feet.</p>
      <p>With a cool head and composed finish, the Adelaide star found the back of the net to stop Victory’s resurgence in its tracks and put his side 3-1 up.</p>
      <p>Remarkably, Adelaide extended their lead just five minutes later as McGree bagged a brace.</p>
