      <p>Rapper Cardi B has linked with Pepsi again for a lavish new commercial.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Cardi B is getting into the holiday spirit with a festive new Pepsi ad.</p>
      <p>The "Bodak Yellow" hitmaker has reteamed with bosses at the soft drink brand for a Christmas-themed promo, in which the rapper instructs a group of elves to hand out money as part of the company's Gift it Forward campaign, promoting acts of charity.</p>
      <p>Cardi, who traveled to London to film the commercial, reveals her love of the holidays made her experience on set a true joy.</p>
      <p>"It just made me so excited, as soon as I got there I'm like, 'We're getting to the holidays,'" <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8544397/cardi-b-pepsi-team-cardi-carol-ad">she told Billboard.</a> "I'm really excited for the holidays this year because my baby's a little bit older. I cannot wait to see her interact with her family. I love toy shopping."</p>
      <p>As for whether or not the "Hustlers" star will record her own Christmas tune, she reveals she finds the idea intimidating.</p>
      <p>"I feel like those aren't things you should touch," she added. "You should leave it to Mariah Carey and leave it there. You don't want to mess it up. You don't want to put a Christmas song out and it don't do good and it ruins your spirit. Listen, I am not playing with Christmas."</p>
