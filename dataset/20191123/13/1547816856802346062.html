        <b>Rashami Desai was among the strongest contestants in the Bigg Boss 13 house. However, of late, she has been a little low. In the new video shared by the channel, we see her sharing her thoughts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ever since Rashami Desai has marked a re-entry in Bigg Boss 13 house, she appears to be lost. Everyone inside the house is of an opinion that Rashami Desai is confused and doesn't know her game well. The Dil Se Dil Tak actress seems to be quite shaken with the opinion made and in the recent promo, we see her sharing her thoughts with the Bigg Boss. She is kind of talking to herself and is commenting on everything that is going on inside the house.</p>
      <p>Rashami in the video has requested fans to show her some support and shower her with love in the form of votes. It feels that Rashami has lost her confidence in her friends and is now just relying on her fans. Meanwhile, she sharing thoughts on the kitchen duties that she has been taking care of for ages. She is talking about Khesari Lal Yadav who refused to help her make rotis and others who rather offered to help. The aura that has formed around her terming her confused has really affected her. Watch the video below:</p>

      <p>Now, it remains to see how long Rashami goes on in Bigg Boss 13 race. Paras Chhabra and Mahira Sharma who were her strongest supporters are now siding with Sidharth Shukla. In fact, no one saved her when Bigg Boss asked housemates to give names of the fellow members they would want to save. Rashami confronted Mahira on this and the latter stated that the former was never her priority.</p>
      <p>Before her eviction, Rashami appeared to be fierce and dominating, however, now she is a complete opposite in the house.Â </p>
