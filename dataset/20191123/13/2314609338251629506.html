      <h1>I shot Beatrice and Maud: a farmer's heartbreak amid fire and drought</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Carol Gibson</a></address>
      <p>Last weekend I shot Beatrice. She had gone into the billabong to get the few remaining sips of water but sank in the mud. She had been there for sometime before I came across her. Mud had dried on her hide and she was exhausted. I put the gun to her forehead between her eyes – such doleful trusting eyes. For a few moments we looked at each other. Her month-old calf stood watching. Then I shot her.</p>

      <p>Several hours later I found the rest of the herd standing silently in a circle around her.</p>
      <p>The weekend before I'd shot Maud. I'd found her stuck in the mud of the dried creek bed. We'd tried to get a rope under her to pull her out with the tractor but it was hopeless.</p>
      <p>I'm at Putty, two hours' drive north-west of Sydney. Our nearest shop is a petrol station 65 kilometres away at Colo Heights. Last week the Gosper’s Mountain fire was less than 10 kilometres from us, approaching rapidly from the south. It was 160,000 hectares of fire, out of control, and it was growing by 10,000 hectares a day.</p>

      <p>Mercifully, conditions have eased in recent days. Firefighters have brought the flames under control – for now. But those fires shut the Putty Road, the only road in or out, and it remains closed. And we're stuck in Sydney, unable to return to the farm.</p>

      <p>Our cattle are starving. The pasture is stubble. We had been hand-feeding them, but the road may not open for another two weeks.</p>
      <p>Twenty-six years ago we came here. In that time the land has progressively dried out. The wetlands have not held water for 20 years. Water in the creek has gone up and down – more downs than ups. It's now dry. There's barely enough water in the dam for the cattle, almost none for firefighting.</p>
      <p>Living through this has left me reading about climate change. Yes, inner-city greenies get it, but so do those of us in the country who are living it.</p>
      <p>The science is irrefutable. You cannot beat physics. Scientists have understood what is happening for more than 100 years, and why it is happening. Greenhouse gases are trapping the heat. It's as true to scientists as the Earth being round, not flat.</p>
      <p>We have ice-core records going back a million years of the planet's temperatures – 800,000 years before man first strode the planet. These show CO2 levels have varied between 180 parts per million in the depth of an ice age, when the temperature was 6C below today's, and 280ppm while the temperature was much like it's been for the past 10,000 years. Now it is over 400ppm – and Earth is already one degree hotter.</p>
      <p>Much as it takes time for our bodies to heat up when we put on an extra blanket, so too with adding CO2 to the atmosphere. It will take time for that 400ppm to fully exert its effect, but it's clearly on the way. On average, the CO2 you and I add today as we turn on our lights will last 200 years; some of it will still be here in 1000 years. Our great-great-great grandchildren will certainly live with it.</p>
      <p>Scientists tell us we must halve our CO2 emissions by 2030 and stop all of them by 2050 if we are to avoid warming of 3C.</p>

      <p>The last time the Earth was 3C hotter, sea levels were 20 meters higher. We're already seeing what 1C means. Three degrees is likely to be exponentially worse.</p>
      <p>You cannot beat the physics.</p>
      <p>We have to make major changes, and we have to accept that they will cost.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure my farm will still be productive with another 1 degree, or that the herd will survive. I'm not even sure our homestead, which has stood for more than 120 years, will be here next week.</p>
