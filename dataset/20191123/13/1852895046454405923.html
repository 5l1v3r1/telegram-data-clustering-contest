      <h4>Happy birthday to the one and only Miley Cyrus! The singer is 27 years old. Over the years, Miley has rocked some of the hottest red carpet looks ever.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/tag/miley-cyrus"><b>Miley Cyrus</b></a> is turning the big 2-7 on Nov. 23. She’s had quite a whirlwind year but her style has remained iconic. Miley has been a fashion legend for years now and she’s not even 30 years old yet. The singer has wowed in a variety of looks that range in everything from color to fabric.</p>
      <p>Just this year alone, Miley has sizzled in a number of <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/miley-cyrus-sexiest-red-carpet-looks-pics/">sexy looks</a>. At the <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> premiere in April 2019, Miley <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/04/22/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-avengers-endgame-premiere-black-dress-cutout-pics/">dazzled in a sexy Saint Laurent dress</a> on the purple carpet. The black gown featured a cutout in the middle and fit the singer like a glove. Miley accompanied her then-husband <b>Liam Hemsworth</b>, 29, to the premiere to support <b>Chris Hemsworth</b>, 36. Miley took the <i>Vanity Fair</i> Oscars after-party by storm in Feb. 2019. She sparkled in a plunging sequined gown. The dress made Miley look like a total goddess.</p>
      <p>Miley hasn’t afraid of some really racy looks over the years. When she hosted the MTV Video Music Awards, Miley rocked a number of wild looks. One of those was a barely-there silver ensemble. The look included a harness-like top and jeweled look.</p>

      <p>Another iconic and very sexy Miley look was her dress at the 2014 amfAR Inspiration Gala. The “Slide Away” singer stepped out in a sexy bondage-inspired gown that featured a sheer top portion that also included crisscrossed, sequined straps. The dress showed off major cleavage and toned abs. Only Miley could think to wear such an eye-popping look and pull it off. Miley’s style is constantly evolving and we can’t wait to see where she takes it next.</p>
