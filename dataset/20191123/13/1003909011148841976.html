      <h1>Preview: Calgary actor hopes for a love-in with her Fringe fest hit Stupid Cupid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:21:49+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Louis B. Hobson</a></address>
      <p>Back in 2016, a wacky version of the love sprite Cupid had invaded U.K.-based actor Liz McMullen’s head and Cupid wasn’t alone.</p>
      <p>“I had all these characters running around in my head and I needed help getting them out.” So McMullen contacted writers Miguel Eichelberger and Kerianne Cameron who were longtime friends from their theatre days in Calgary. McMullen met Cameron when they were summer drama camp counsellors at the Pumphouse Theatres.</p>
      <p>“In 2016, I was at a place in my life where I was actively questioning what love is. I wanted to know as much as possible about the different kinds of love so I could decide what type of love I wanted in my life. As the ideas formulated, I knew they could be the basis of a solo show but I also knew I was not a writer.”</p>
      <p>Eichelberger and Cameron, who had moved to Vancouver, were excited to help their friend create her solo show Stupid Cupid.</p>
      <p>“Though the ideas for the show are very much my creation, Miguel and Kerianne took them and really ran with them. They fleshed out the ideas into a show that has been a hit wherever I’ve taken it,” says McMullen, who premiered her show at the 2017 Vancouver Fringe Festival. She then brought it to the Brighton Fringe, the Camden Fringe in London and finally to the Edinburgh Fringe.</p>
      <p>“The Edinburgh Fringe is crazy. There were almost 4,000 shows booked for the festival this year. I figured I’d better go hard or go home so I did 26 shows in 27 days. By the end I was both energized and exhausted. It was a great experience but I wanted to end the year on a real high, which meant bringing Stupid Cupid back to Calgary and especially to the Pumphouse where I got my first start.”</p>
      <p>When McMullen was 17, and a student at Sir Winston Churchill High School, she appeared in a StoryBook Theatre show called The King’s Stag. She went on to train at Mount Royal University, working with people like Jane MacFarlane and Joe Norman Shaw. After graduating here, she studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts.</p>
      <p>In Stupid Cupid, audience members will meet an apprentice cupid who, before she can get her wings, accidentally shoots herself with one of her love arrows, making her fall in love with everyone in the audience. Stupid Cupid, as she quickly becomes known, craves every kind of love from the exotic to the erotic.</p>
      <p>“One of the initial motivations behind creating Stupid Cupid was my realization just how much the world needs love. I felt if, as a performer, sharing my feelings and insights with an audience could make them laugh and feel better, I was doing my little part to make the world a better place.”</p>
      <p>Because Stupid Cupid has been such a success on stage, McMullen, Eichelberger and Cameron have decided to turn it into a television series.</p>
      <p>“The TV series is definitely our project for 2020. We created the stage show in Vancouver and we’ll be doing the same for the TV series.”</p>
      <p>Stupid Cupid runs in the Pumphouse’s Joyce Doolittle Theatre Nov. 29 at 7:30 p.m. and on Nov. 30 at 2 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $20 and are available on <a href="http://eventbrite.com/e/stupid-cupid-tickets">eventbrite.com/e/stupid-cupid-tickets</a> or at the door. The adult content of the show makes it suitable for 18 years and older.</p>
