        <b>Director of Public Prosecutions on Saturday, November 23, ordered the arrest of Ibrahim Taraiya a supervisor at Eastmatt Supermarket in Kajiado.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taraiya was captured by CCTV cameras assaulting a female cashier on November 19, 2019. </p>
      <p>The DPP stated that upon his arrest, Taraiya would be arraigned at Kajiado Court on Monday.</p>
      <p>This came barely a day after the supervisor was indicted over the assault, with the organisation stating that it did not condone his behaviour.</p>

      <p>The video was posted online by Kajiado ODM politician Lydia Ngaira on Friday, on November 22 but had been recorded on Tuesday, November 19.</p>
      <p>She claimed that he was taking out his anger on the female colleague because he had been fired. </p>
      <p>The clip showed that after a few blows, the victim tried holding the assailant's hand, a move that seemed to have enraged him even more.</p>
      <p>The cashier tried hiding below her work station but the attacker dragged her from under the desk by her collar.</p>
      <p>Another male colleague tried to intervene and hold back the aggressor who seemed extremely enraged, as he tried to manoeuvre out of the man's arms.</p>
      <p>The politician who shared the video called for the arrest of the assailant, claiming that nothing warranted how the woman was treated.</p>

        <i>Below is the video of the assault:</i>
