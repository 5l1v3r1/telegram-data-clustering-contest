      <h1>In Bob we trust: Documentary follows strange history of the Church of the SubGenius</h1>

      <p>Midway through Sandy K. Boone’s J.R. “Bob” Dobbs and The Church of the SubGenius, viewers finally get a description of the religion at the heart of the documentary.</p>
      <p>Sporting the same smart-alecky grin he wears throughout the film, artist and charter associate Paul Mavrides offers a definition of The Church of the SubGenius as it evolved in the 1980s, when the parody religion first began to gain traction among America’s weirdos.</p>
      <p>“We actually are a religion that seems like an art piece that seems like performance art that seems like a joke that seems like a religion,” Mavrides explains.</p>

      <p>As a documentary filmmaker attempting to unravel the convoluted history and beliefs of the Church of the SubGenius, one might think Boone would be a bit frustrated by the cryptic nature of Mavrides’ definition. As with everyone else involved, he seems incapable of giving a clear answer about the true nature of this phenomenon.</p>
      <p>“No, that was part of the fun and it needed to be fun,” says Boone, in an interview from her office in Austin, Texas.</p>

      <p>In fact, Mavrides’ slippery definition may be the cornerstone of the film, showing how the founders of the Texas-born church never took it seriously even as it was embraced in some circles and strongly denounced as dangerous in others. They were as surprised as anyone when it began gaining in popularity among disenfranchised oddballs in the 1980s. They also became terrified when some devotees seemed to take its darkly comic world view to heart.</p>
      <p>While Boone describes herself as a “normal” — ostensibly the enemy of the SubGenius due to their stubborn insistence on “making normality the norm” — she actually has a personal connection to the group. Her husband David Boone, a filmmaker and fellow Texan, became involved in the church early on and even directed a SubGenius-inspired film in 1980 called Invasion of the Aluminum. David passed away 20 years ago, but Boone stayed in touch with SubGenius co-founder Doug Smith.</p>
      <p>Smith was apparently worried about what might happen to Church of the SubGenius after he was gone, specifically that it would become the very thing it was satirizing. There had been attempts at documentaries before, but they have never come to fruition. </p>
      <p>“Doug Smith was saying ‘Sandy, I’m 65 and I’m terrified that I’m going to die and they are going to take this seriously and turn this into Scientology or Mormonism,” says Boone.</p>
      <p>Smith thought that Boone, by then a veteran film producer, had the perfect insider-outsider view of the church to make the film. She will be in Calgary on Nov. 30 to screen it at the Globe Cinema as part of CUFF. Docs, which runs from Nov. 27 to Dec. 1. For her part, Boone wanted to play homage to her husband, who doesn’t actually appear in the film. But she also thought the time was right for a documentary of this sort. She was horrified by the election of Donald Trump and how reality was somehow exceeding the satirical, exaggerated divisions that lay at the heart of SubGenius theology.</p>
      <p>So Boone pored over the intimidating amount of archival footage and literature that the church had built up over the years to trace its development. While the beliefs of the SubGenius are not always easy for outsiders to wrap their heads around, its humble beginnings seemed to be a fairly simple act of rebellion from two Texas misfits who bonded over a love of Captain Beefheart and morbid curiosity about religious and political extremism.</p>
      <p>Smith and his friend Steve Wilcox soon rechristened themselves Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond, respectively, and began building a faith around a prophet named J.R. “Bob” Dobbs, a pipe-smoking salesman personified by a generic piece of clip-art the pair stumbled upon. “Bob” preached a complex and apocalyptic belief system filled with conspiracy theories and aliens. He pushed followers to strive for “slack,” a state that is never full explained but apparently separates true believers from the mindless hordes of “normals,” who will be either euthanized or enslaved when otherworldly judgment comes.</p>
      <p>To promote this new “cult,” Smith and Wilcox became faux religious charlatans, convinced their followers would maintain the same levels of self-awareness that they themselves possessed.</p>
      <p>“They decide they are going to start this fake religion and they are going to promise eternity or triple your money back,” Boone says. “It was all done as tongue-in-cheek performance art.”</p>
      <p>Eventually, the religion spread. While it didn’t spark the same sort of moral panic as Satanism did in the 1980s, mainstream America seemed both startled and curious about the church. Some of the funniest scenes in the documentary involve the media’s coverage as it expanded into live performances, published books and raucous regional meetings throughout the U.S. “Their prophet’s name is Bob and their followers are legion,” offered one earnest reporter in a leaden voice-over.</p>
      <p>But, much to its founders’ surprise, the church also attracted a few who seemed disturbingly devoted to some of the darker strains of this fake belief system.</p>
      <p>“They wanted it to be everything they said it was,” Boone says. “That’s when Doug really had a fearful moment, saying ‘Buddy, I got high with Philo one night and made all this up.’ People were sending guns through the mail and they were saying ‘Anybody that’s against the SubGenius, we will kill them.’ That terrified them. That was not what this was supposed to be about.”</p>
      <p>In the documentary, Boone offers a dizzying collage of archival footage, animation, talking heads and testimonies from the church’s more famous admirers, including magician Penn Jillette, filmmaker Richard Linklater and actor-comedian Nick Offerman. The film also follows America as it descends into stranger-than-SubGenius territory, showing footage of the Columbine shootings, 9/11 and the rise of Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The Church of the SubGenius still exists and Boone says she hopes the film helps boost its profile again, suggesting it’s the perfect antidote for her country’s deepening divisions.</p>
      <p>“Because of the political situation in our country right now and seeing the hate, this is what drew me in,” says Boone. “This has got to stop. The SubGeniuses are getting older.  I really would hope some young people would take up the mantle and use this tongue-in-cheek humour to move forward and talk about difficult things again without using hate.”</p>
