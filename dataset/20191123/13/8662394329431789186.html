      <p>There is much we don't understand about breast milk, particularly in terms of the complex interplay between different components and how they work together to achieve complete nutrition for infants and young children.</p>

      <p>What we do know is that breast milk is a dynamic food that changes according to the needs of breastfed infants.</p>
      <p>For example, breast milk produced by a mother of a premature infant is very different to the breast milk of a mother who gave birth to a baby born at 40 weeks, which is very different to the breast milk received by a six-month-old, or a 12-month-old or even a two-year-old child.</p>
      <p>In stark contrast, formula is a static food that provides the basic nutrients required for infant growth.</p>
      <p>Even as the scientific community develops an understanding of breast milk, the ability to mimic breast milk and its capacity to protect from disease, promote mental and physical growth or optimise development is unlikely to ever happen.</p>
      <p>The physical act of breastfeeding provides opportunities for growth and development that is not available to the formula-fed infant.</p>
      <p>The action of suckling at the breast versus sucking on a bottle teat shows clear differences in oral muscle activity and dental development.</p>
      <p>Breast fed babies have been shown to have fewer speech and enunciation problems and the oral cavity is able to develop normal shape and functionality.</p>
      <p>Even with the array of formula products available today, none can provide infants and children with the best possible start to life.</p>
