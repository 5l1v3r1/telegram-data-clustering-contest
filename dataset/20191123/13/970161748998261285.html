      <p>At least one lucky Briton is £105 million richer after staking a claim for Tuesday’s EuroMillions jackpot.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known whether the UK ticket-holder is an individual or a syndicate.</p>
      <p>National Lottery operator Camelot said the prize will be paid out at a ticket validation appointment before the winner decides whether to go public.</p>
      <p>The big prize on the 25th anniversary of the first National Lottery draw was the sixth EuroMillions jackpot banked in the UK this year.</p>
      <p>The winning numbers were 8, 10, 15, 30, 42  and stars: 4, 6</p>
      <p>Andy Carter, senior winners’ adviser at the National Lottery, said: ‘What a way to celebrate 25 years of the National Lottery.</p>
      <p>‘This is the sixth massive EuroMillions jackpot win in 2019 and follows the nation’s biggest ever win of £170 million just last month.</p>
      <p>‘We now focus on supporting the ticket-holder as they start to enjoy their newfound wealth.</p>

      <p>‘Make sure you have a ticket to be in with a chance to win big.’</p>

      <p>A UK ticket-holder won the £170 million EuroMillions jackpot in October, making them the UK’s biggest winner.</p>
      <p>The previous biggest UK winners were Colin and Chris Weir, from Largs in North Ayrshire, who won £161 million in July 2011.</p>
      <p>A £123 million jackpot was won by a UK ticket-holder in June and a UK winner scooped £38 million on the EuroMillions in April.</p>
      <p>Ade Goodchild, from Hereford, bagged £71 million on March 15 and Patrick and Frances Connolly, from Northern Ireland, won £114.9 million on New Year’s Day.</p>
