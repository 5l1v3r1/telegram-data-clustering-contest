      <p>Bruno Fornaroli became the fastest player to score 50 A-League goals, but it was Sydney FC who took the spoils with a 3-1 victory over Perth Glory in Saturday night's grand final rematch.</p>
      <p>Sydney hit the lead in the 12th minute at HBF Park courtesy of an Adam Le Fondre penalty, but Glory were back on even terms in the 44th minute when Fornaroli produced a sweet right-foot strike.</p>
      <p>Fornaroli's 50th goal came in just his 76th game, beating the previous record of 79 matches set by both Shane Smeltz and Besart Berisha.</p>
      <p>But that joy was short-lived, with second-half goals to Kosta Barbarouses and Milos Ninkovic guiding Sydney to their fifth win of the season.</p>
      <p>The result left the Sky Blues nicely nestled in second spot.</p>
