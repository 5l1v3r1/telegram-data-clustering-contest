      <h1>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sends message to Granit Xhaka in Arsenal programme notes</h1>
      <h2>The Gabonese forward has taken over from Xhaka as the new club captain following the reaction to the Swiss midfielder's substitution against Crystal Palace last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:18:52+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had words for Granit Xhaka in his captain's programme notes for Arsenal's clash with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The forward has taken over the armband from the Swiss midfielder following the reaction to the latter's substitution against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was jeered by home fans when he was replaced after an hour of the 2-2 draw, and was seen mouthing "f*** off" to the fans as he left the pitch.</p>
      <p>The subsequent reaction eventually lead to Xhaka issuing a statement apologising if he had caused any offence, but the row had already turned toxic and eventually led to him losing the club captaincy.</p>
      <p>Xhaka hasn't played for the club since the incident, but is set to return to the squad for Saturday's clash with the Saints.</p>

      <p>And Aubameyang's captain's column called for support for both Xhaka and the rest of the team.</p>
      <p>"I took over from Granit in tough circumstances but I am very proud to be wearing the armband," said Aubameyang.</p>
      <p>"It is an honour. It comes with a lot of responsibilities but I feel I can do a great job.</p>
      <p>"I would like to also say a word for Granit.</p>

      <p>"I understand that sometimes one can make mistakes. It happens to all of us. Granit is one of us. We are all here for him and I know how strong he is.</p>
      <p>"It was tough to see all of this happening but we need to move forward together."</p>
      <p>"This is my message for you <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> fans. We need you. You are amazing, your support is amazing and we need to all pull in the same direction.</p>
      <p>"I really hope you will be massively behind us today and for the rest of the season."</p>
