      <h1>Salary sacrifice into super? You’re about to get a free boost</h1>

        <b>Hi Nicole, I am 32 years old and have been salary sacrificing into super, as you suggest. I have been paying in $10,000 a year of my $100,000 salary. This is on top of the $8550 my employer pays. I was wondering what else I can do to boost my super and make up for any potential child-rearing years down the track. My fund has made an annual return of about 8 per cent over the past three years, which I am fairly happy with, given the market has had ups and downs. I’m single, hopefully just for now! Many thanks, Margaret</b>

      <p>Firstly, well done for shovelling money into your super when it counts most: in your early years, when there is lots of time to let the magic of compounded – or reinvested – investment returns grow your retirement savings.</p>

        <figcaption>Employers will be forced to contribute 9.5 per cent of your total remuneration, regardless of the fact you salary sacrifice.</figcaption>

      <p>Secondly, I have some news which, from January 1, will help boost your booty even further – for free.</p>
      <p>Changes to superannuation legislation mean that from next year, employers will no longer be able to opportunistically reduce their mandated 9.5 per cent superannuation guarantee (SG) contributions because you have reduced your cash salary.</p>
      <p>This is what employers often do now – pay super only on what is left of your salary after your salary sacrifice. For example, paying your compulsory SG on just $90,000 – hence an $8550 contribution.</p>

      <p>Instead, employers will now be forced to contribute 9.5 per cent of your total remuneration – or the full $100,000 in your case – regardless of the fact you salary sacrifice 10 per cent of this.</p>
      <p>This redresses a crazy situation whereby those who sensibly salary sacrifice into super have seen their employer contributions cut.</p>
      <p>For you, the closure of the loophole will mean a $950 gross super top-up each year… for doing nothing whatsoever.</p>
      <p>Your new total $9500 gross SG payment, plus the $10,000 gross you additionally salary sacrifice, will overnight lift you to almost 20 per cent concessional – or pre-tax – contributions (importantly, you will still fall below the $25,000 contributions limit).</p>
      <p>All employers are required to update their systems to comply with the new law from the January 1.</p>
      <p>However, Margaret, you could possibly update your fund… to further enhance your salary sacrifice and employer’s soon-more-generous payments.</p>
      <p>The 8 per cent return a year you speak of is okay as a long-term average but, over the past three years, many funds have done better.</p>
      <p>Assuming you are in a balanced fund, with up to about 75 per cent invested in growth assets, such as property and shares, the top fund over that period – AustralianSuper – has returned 10.24 per cent.</p>

      <p>Sunsuper for Life is a close second with 10.16 per cent and Hostplus, third with 10.06 per cent.</p>

      <p>It is crucial to look at terms even longer than three years to identify the best performing funds.</p>
      <p>You don’t want one that "shoots the lights out" over just a couple of years but then falls way in subsequent years. You want a fund that is consistently good.</p>
