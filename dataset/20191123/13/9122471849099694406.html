      <h1>ESPN’s Final Prediction For Ohio State-Penn State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:49:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has finalized its prediction for this afternoon’s Ohio State-Penn State game. The Buckeyes and the Nittany Lions are getting ready for kickoff in Columbus.</p>
      <p>This is essentially a must-win game for both teams. Ohio State locks up a spot in the Big Ten Championship Game with a win, while Penn State would just need to beat Rutgers next week.</p>
      <p>It’s possible the Buckeyes could make the College Football Playoff at 11-1, but it’s not likely. So this is a very massive contest taking place in Columbus today.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s computer likes Ohio State – big.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s Football Power Index is giving No. 2 Ohio State an 83.9 percent chance of winning today’s game. It gives Penn State just a 16.1 percent chance of pulling off the upset.</h3>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State are set to kick off at noon E.T. inside Ohio Stadium.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
