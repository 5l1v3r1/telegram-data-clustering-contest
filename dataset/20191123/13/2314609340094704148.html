      <h1>Enough rope for a Windsor knot: unravelling Prince Andrew's disastrous interview</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Claire Kimball</a></address>
      <p>Not content with allowing his father to be the only royal involved in a car crash this year, you had to be living on the dark side of the moon not to see Prince Andrew’s spectacular flame-out this week.</p>
      <p>In the modern era of "minder games" where our notable figures – whether they be politicians, corporate leaders, or, indeed, royals – are stage-managed to within an inch of their public lives, it was a rare sight indeed.</p>

      <p>If you haven’t watched the 50-minute interview, and you’re interested in such things, I implore you to do so. It is extraordinary, and so much more interesting than the short grabs that have been playing on high rotation this week.</p>
      <p>It was clear that Andrew had put a lot of thought into what he wanted to say. You could see a little glimmer in his eye a couple of times when he thought he had delivered a cracking line. You could almost see him practising his lines with Fergie and her egging him on. (Yes, if you're not keeping up with your royals, they remain close.)</p>
      <p>“Yes, Andrew, people need to understand that you’re a victim too,” his cheer-leading squad apparently said to him. They’re the people who probably thought going on national (and now international) TV was a good way to clear his name and set the record straight. All of that, of course, only makes it worse.</p>

      <p>The line that got me was somewhere in the middle of the interview when he was at pains to talk about his 2010 stay at accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's New York mansion. He went to stay with Epstein to tell him to his face that their friendship was over. Keep in mind, this is after Epstein served time in jail for procuring an underage girl for prostitution.</p>
      <p>Asked why it was necessary, Andrew said: “I admit fully that my judgment was probably coloured by my tendency to be too honourable. But that’s just the way it is."</p>
      <p>The initials OMG were made for moments like that.</p>
      <p>In an interview packed with such jaw-dropping moments, it should also not go unremarked just how impressive the interviewer was. The BBC’s <i>Newsnight</i> presenter, Emily Maitlis, delivered a masterclass in what it means to be cool, calm and collected.</p>

      <p>You can see how Prince Andrew came out of it thinking he did well. At no point did she speak over him, which is possible when you have a senior member of the royals devoting an hour to a televisual free-for-all. Not point rushing it. Maitlis did not even as much as a raise an eyebrow at some of the unbelievable things he said.</p>
      <p>I don’t think I’ve ever seen a better example of an interviewer giving someone the space to put his foot in his mouth, then jam it down further and further.</p>
      <p>In this era of hyperbole, it is also remarkable that Andrew's interview is as bad as everyone says it was. It is no surprise that it brought about an end to Prince Andrew’s public life for the foreseeable future. Disaster rating: 4.5/5.</p>
      <p>Which prompts the question: what other nuclear moments have brought down the high and mighty? The obvious example is John Hewson, who talked himself out of an election win in 1993 with his response to a question from the late, great Mike Willesee about the GST he was proposing and how it would affect the price of a birthday cake. That interview also ended a career, so you’d have to say it was at least a 4/5 on the negative impact scale.</p>
      <p>Then there are moments when it wasn’t words but actions that got their subjects into trouble. The Mark Latham handshake that gave incumbent PM John Howard the upper hand. Tony Abbott’s silent nodding regard of Seven’s political editor, Mark Riley, when you didn’t know what might happen next. Even Tom Cruise’s jump onto the hallowed couch of Saint Oprah changed things immeasurably.</p>

      <p>They were all unscripted moments that no media minder – unless in a weird mind-meld with his or her boss – could anticipate.</p>
      <p>But those were just moments. All mentioned got to go on and lead their lives. But for Prince Andrew, it’s hard not to think that things are changed forever.</p>
      <p>He’ll probably be fine with all the things that being a royal brings. But from watching that interview, I don’t think he knows just how wrong he got it. Not just the media management side of things, but on the matter of his self-declared “honourable” life.</p>
      <p>He could muster no real compassion for the victims of Epstein, and he displayed no understanding of what his tacit endorsement of such a vile cretin did. And watching that, it was just sad.</p>
