      <p>While the trailer fails to confirm which hero falls in the finale, it's not hard to think of a few likely candidates who could make the ultimate sacrifice for their friends. So, let's breakdown the members of the Titans that may not be long for this world.</p>

      <h3>HAWK</h3>

      <p>For the better part of the show's run, Hank Hall (Alan Ritchson) has struggled with substance abuse. Dating back to the trauma he suffered as a child, Hank has had a rough go of it. He lost his brother in a tragic car accident, broke up with Dawn Granger (Minka Kelly) on several occasions and couldn't prevent the death of his friend, Aqualad (Drew Van Acker).</p>

      <p>Recently, Hank fell off the wagon again, leaving Dawn high and dry after the Titans disbanded following Dick's bombshell about Jericho's death. The hero, formerly known as Hawk, decided to take up cocaine and cage fighting rather than deal with his issues, which came back to bite him at the end of Episode 12. If Hank wants to make amends for his mistakes, he may have to make the ultimate sacrifice to save his pseudo-family.</p>
      <h3>DONNA TROY</h3>

      <p>Wonder Girl (Conor Leslie) is going to have a tough week coming up. Not only will she have to come face-to-face with the killer of her first love, but she'll also have to fight a half-Kryptonian. From the recently released trailer, it's safe to say that Superboy (Joshua Orpin) is at the mercy of Cadmus Labs, having been caught by the organization a few weeks back. With Starfire's (Anna Diop) abilities on the fritz, Donna is next up to fight the clone, which doesn't bode well for her.</p>

      <p>Even if the Titans can free Conner, Deathstroke (Esai Morales) is still on the prowl, and it's safe to say that Donna has an ax to grind with him. In the flashbacks earlier this season, Wonder Girl went after Slade hard, almost losing her life to the Terminator. If her feelings about Garth's death resurface, there may be nothing to stop Donna from going after Deathstroke one last time.</p>
      <h3>JERICHO</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>In last week's episode, "E.L._.O.," it was revealed that Jericho (Chella Man) not only survived the death blow from his father, but he was living inside of daddy dearest using his abilities. For the past five years, Jericho and Slade have been stuck in a mental battle, with the latter coming out on top. However, with Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites) realizing that his old friend is still alive, it's only a matter of time before Jericho escapes.</p>

      <p>Knowing that Jericho cares deeply about the Titans, he would do anything to stop his dad from hurting them, including sacrificing himself. While it would be unfortunate fans didn't get to spend more time with the light-hearted hero, his death would cement himself as a Titan for life.</p>
      <h3>RAVEN</h3>

      <p>The youngest of the Titans, Rachel (Teagan Croft), has been struggling with her abilities since the first episode of the series. While helpful, her powers tend to go haywire, as seen when the Gargoyle she inadvertently gave life to mauled a man to death. The continuous cycle of pain has taken a toll on Rachel who wants nothing more than to be a hero alongside her friends.</p>

      <p>To add to her power struggle, the season finale trailer reveals that Raven has seen visions of her death at the hands of Deathstroke, much like the one she had with Dick earlier in the season. If these dreams do come to pass, the Titans could be saying goodbye to a friend far too soon. What will help fans sleep better at night, however, is that in the comics, Raven has returned from the dead on numerous occasions, so hopefully, she wouldn't be gone for long.</p>
