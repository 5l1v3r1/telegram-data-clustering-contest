      <p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is honoured to have been named Arsenal’s captain, having been so desperate to lead teams when he was younger he bought armbands for himself.</p>
      <p>Aubameyang was confirmed as Arsenal’s new skipper earlier this month, when Granit Xhaka was stripped of the responsibility following his angry confrontation with fans in October’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the club’s matchday programme ahead of Saturday’s game against Southampton, his first home match since being confirmed as club captain, Aubameyang said: “Arsenal has a great history of wonderful captains like Patrick Vieira and Tony Adams. It is a privilege to follow in their footsteps and I will honour the armband by doing my very best on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>“When I was younger, I remember always wanting to be captain in my youth teams. I was talking about it with my mum just the other day actually. We were laughing because we recalled how I used to buy armbands myself so I could wear them.</p>
      <p>“At the start of my career, I was not too focused on being captain or not. Now, it feels right. It comes with a lot of responsibilities but I feel I can do a great job. I have been Gabon captain since 2015 and that was also a great honour.</p>
      <p>“My dad was also the national team captain when he was playing. So to take over from him in a way was again very special. Now, I am doing the double with Arsenal and Gabon and it is a wonderful privilege.”</p>
