      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4951742/hibs-fail-darren-fletcher-talks-manager/">Hibs recently failed in a bid to hold talks with Fletcher</a> over their managerial post before Jack Ross landed the top job.</p>
      <p>And he admits he could be tempted to pull his boots back on.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50521984">BBC Scotland:</a> "It would have to be something that was really appealing.</p>
      <p>"I've not officially retired yet for a few different reasons.</p>
      <p>"There would have to be a number of different factors - I'm very happy with what I've achieved in my career."</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old doesn't feel quite ready to go into management just yet.</p>

      <p>But he insists it's something he definitely sees for his future.</p>
      <p>He added: "It's always something I thought I would go into.</p>
      <p>"I love the game, would love to still be involved in the game, coaching and speaking in the dressing rooms and motivating players.</p>
      <p>"Inspiring players comes naturally to me so hopefully that transcends to management.</p>
      <p>"A managerial role is something I definitely see in my future but at the same time I don't feel I'm quite ready yet.</p>
      <p>"I need to go and define what I would be as a manager, finish my coaching badges, try and take in as much experience as I can from different clubs around the world, the UK, and speak to as many people as possible to try and prepare myself for when I do make that step.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully it's not too far in the future, but as of now any opportunities that came round I wouldn't be ready to take."</p>
      <p>Fletcher learned his trade under legend Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, and revealed his ultimate goal is to follow his pal Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and eventually boss the Reds.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s no different to being a player - when I was a player I wanted to play for the biggest and best club in the world, and I did that at United.</p>
      <p>“So when I take my steps on the management ladder my goal is to become Manchester United manager because that’s the pinnacle for me. Nothing tops that.</p>
      <p>“There’s thousands of players who play, but there’s not that many manager’s jobs, and United is the biggest job in the world for me.</p>
