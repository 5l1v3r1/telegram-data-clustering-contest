        <b>Brescia coach Fabio Grosso has urged Mario Balotelli to “help himself” as the striker was dropped for Sunday’s match against Roma.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mario Balotelli has been left out of Brescia’s squad for Sunday’s Serie A meeting with Roma after the former Manchester City striker was involved in a training-ground argument with coach Fabio Grosso.</p>
      <p>Balotelli signed for his hometown club Brescia – who sit bottom of Serie A – in August and has scored two goals in seven league appearances so far.</p>
      <p>However, he reportedly stormed out of a Brescia training session on Thursday following a disagreement with Grosso, who hinted in a news conference on Saturday the ex-Inter forward would not be included in his squad.</p>

      <p>“What happened with Balotelli is something I’d already experienced in the past. I demand great intensity and a high tempo in my training sessions. When that doesn’t happen, I prefer to change and make the session tougher,” Grosso said.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t do that and was set to one side. I don’t want to minimise the incident, nor blow it out of proportion. It will be crucial for me to use everyone at my disposal, but I can only do so much. At a certain point, he has to help himself.</p>
      <p>“You will know of disciplinary action, but I prefer to communicate these things to the players first myself. It’ll be for the good of the team. I don’t deny what I said about Mario, because I still really want to use his characteristics for the side.”</p>
      <p>Balotelli’s omission was subsequently confirmed as Brescia confirmed their 20-man squad for Sunday’s trip to Stadio Olimpico.</p>
