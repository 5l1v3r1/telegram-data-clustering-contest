      <p>Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte says steelmaker <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arcelormittal">ArcelorMittal </a>has agreed to try for a negotiated solution over the fate of a southern Italian steel plant.</p>
      <p>Conte and his economy and economic development ministers held four-hour talks ending Friday before midnight with ArcelorMittal's top executives.</p>
      <p>Union leaders on Saturday insisted that any deal must exclude layoffs.</p>
      <p>The French-Indian steelmaker, currently renting the mill, wants out of a contract obliging it to buy the Taranto plant. It cites production concerns and Italy's removal of immunity from prosecution in case of environmental damage.</p>
      <p>Conte said both sides have agreed to seek a delay of next week's court hearing over the contract dispute.</p>
      <p>He told reporters: Let's allow this negotiation to develop with the goal of agreeing on an industrial plan using clean technology. The company didn't immediately comment.</p>
