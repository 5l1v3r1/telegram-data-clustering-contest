      <p>Over 12 years ago, Valve released what would be the final entry in its long-running, beloved “Half-Life” video game series.</p>
      <p>The game ended on a narrative cliffhanger which turned into a real-life cliffhanger. Would another “Half-Life” game ever come out? For years – 12 and counting – the answer was no.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, seemingly out of nowhere, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/half-life-alyx-game-reveal-anouncement-trailer-release-date-valve-2019-11">a new “Half-Life” game was announced</a>. “Half-Life: Alyx” isn’t the “Half-Life 3” people have been waiting for. Instead, it’s a prequel – set between the events of “Half-Life” and “Half-Life 2.”</p>
      <p>Oh, and there’s another big caveat: “Half-Life: Alyx” is a virtual reality game that can only be played on PC in VR.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It turns out there’s a good reason for both of those major derivations from fan expectations.</p>
      <p>“In all honesty, back in 2016 when we started this, ‘Half-Life 3’ was just a terrifyingly daunting prospect,” Valve game designer Robin Walker said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9K0eJEmMEw">in an interview with Geoff Keighley ahead of The 2019 Game Awards</a>. “I think to some extent, VR was a way we could fool ourselves into believing we had a way to do this.”</p>
      <p>Instead of starting the project as “Half-Life 3,” it was started as a way to answer the question, “Where’s the big VR title?” Walker said. That’s because Valve – the company behind the massively-popular Steam storefront – has been pushing hard into VR for years now.</p>
      <p>First, the company teamed up with HTC to create the Vive. Now, it produces the Valve Index, which is an even higher-fidelity VR headset than the Vive. Valve’s Index is considered the Ferrari of VR headsets, a title it earned both by its technical prowess and absurdly high $1,000 all-in price point.</p>
      <p>But even for all of Valve’s support for virtual reality – to say nothing of Sony’s support with PlayStation VR, or Facebook’s support with Oculus – the market for VR headsets has not taken off. One major reason for that is a lack of so-called “must-play” games, and, in 2016, Valve employees sought to solve that problem.</p>
      <p>To that end, Valve only has so many properties that make sense for virtual reality.</p>
      <p>“We settled on ‘Portal’ or ‘Half-Life’ as interesting,” Valve game developer David Speyrer said.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Both franchises are in first-person, making them logical choices for VR. “Portal” was quickly ruled out, he said, because of concerns about making players sick while being flung through the air in VR.</p>
      <p>With “Half-Life,” the franchise was simply a template for experimentation with a “big” VR project – not an attempt to conclude a beloved franchise after 12 years of dormancy. Instead, it became a project named “Half-Life: Alyx” over time as the development team went from prototyping game mechanics to creating a full-on game.</p>
      <p>“It was really easy to not think about the big picture of, ‘We’re making Half-Life 3,'” Walker said, “And just focus on ‘Let’s figure out what people enjoy in this and make forward progress.'”</p>
      <p>He compared VR, as a gameplay hook, to the iconic gravity gun from “Half-Life 2” – a means of focusing the team around something specific that could guide design. “In some ways, VR was a little bit … the way the gravity gun helped us in ‘Half-Life 2,’ where it just became the tentpole that you could wrap so much around. And so VR became this thing that we could wrap everything around.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>To that end, the game isn’t planned for a non-VR release. “Half-Life: Alyx” is designed specifically with VR in mind, and its designers say it wouldn’t translate easily to PC or game consoles.</p>
      <p>That doesn’t necessarily mean there won’t be more “Half-Life” on other platforms in the future, but the developers of “Half-Life: Alyx” are hesitant to make any promises. And they should be – the last 12 years have included a lot of “Half-Life” suggestions and non-committal statements about the state of the franchise.</p>
      <p>“We want to put this out and see how the world reacts to it before we make any concrete plans about what’s next,” Speyrer said.</p>
      <p>“Half-Life: Alyx” is scheduled to arrive in March 2020 on Valve’s Steam service.</p>
