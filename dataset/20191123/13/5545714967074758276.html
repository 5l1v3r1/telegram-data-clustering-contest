      <p>Retro games publisher Hamster has something a little different and a little special for this week's release, as Irem's attractive shmup <i>In the Hunt</i> has returned for PS4 and Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/>Originally released in arcades in 1993, (and appearing later on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation), <i>In the Hunt</i> is a horizontally-scrolling shooter set within the claustrophobic confines of the deep blue sea. After a terrorist organisation known as the D.A.S. (Dark Anarchy Society) flood the planet by melting the polar ice caps, a resistance force creates a powerful battle submarine, the Granvia, to fight its way to the D.A.S. sub-aquatic headquarters and blow it sky sea-high. You can check out a video below from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bew_JEgZbUc">World of Longplays</a>.</p>

      <p><i>In the Hunt</i> was designed by the team who would go on to create the<i> Metal Slug</i> series for SNK and it shows, packed to the gills with detailed and delightfully-animated sprites, intricate backgrounds and explosive effects. Players guide the Granvia through both shallow and deep waters, fighting off the D.A.S. forces as well as a series of formidable bosses. Though a little more deliberately-paced than some shmup fans might expect (reflecting its aquatic nature) <i>In the Hunt</i> remains today a unique and enjoyable example of the genre.<br/><br/><i>In the Hunt</i> is available to now on PS4 in Japan and Nintendo Switch worldwide, priced around $8.</p>
