      <p>PC Shaun Thomas saw PCSO Tony Meakin looking dazed and confused as he got out of his car and managed to catch him as he began to fall to the ground in June last year.</p>
      <p>After checking his breathing and pulse, and putting the unconscious officer into the recovery position, PC Thomas called for an ambulance.</p>
      <p>PC Lee Wood then took over monitoring the 55-year-old’s breathing and responsiveness while PC Thomas briefed paramedics, explaining he believed PCSO Meakin had suffered a stroke.</p>
      <p>“If it hadn’t been for them it would have been a lot worse," said PCSO Meakin, who has since made a full recovery. “I’m just so grateful to them both - their quick actions meant my recovery was much better and much faster than it might have been."</p>
      <p>PC Thomas and PC Wood received Royal Humane Society certificates of commendation from Chief Constable Dave Thompson at a ceremony on November 19.</p>
