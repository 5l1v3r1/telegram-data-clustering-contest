        <figcaption>Posting images to multiple platforms like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook might seem a bit taxing. However, with a few simple steps, you can set up Instagram to do so automatically when you upload an image on to it. All you need to do is head to Profile &gt; Options &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Linked Accounts and there link all your social media accounts. This will then automatically start sharing images on all your social media accounts as and when you upload them on Instagram.</figcaption>

Inside of the setting you simply need to toggle the switch to disable the feature.</figcaption>
