      <p><b>All signs:</b> We have the “all clear” today to shop and do business. The Moon is in Leo.</p>
      <p><b>Aries (March 21 — April 19)</b><br/>It’s tough to hide your emotions today, especially if you have a crush on someone. If you’re in a relationship, you might be possessive. Meanwhile, this is a great day to socialize and enjoy activities with children because you’re in a playful, fun-loving mood.</p>
      <p><b>Taurus (April 20 — May 20)</b><br/>It might be hard to crank up the energy to go to work today because you would rather cocoon at home. (I know the feeling.) You feel a bit private today and you also want to enjoy the pleasant familiarity of your own surroundings.</p>
      <p><b>Gemini (May 21 — June 20)</b><br/>You’re eager to talk to others today because you want to enlighten people about something. This is why, in discussions with others, you want to get right down to the nitty-gritty. You don’t want to waste time and superficial chit-chat.</p>
      <p><b>Cancer (June 21 — July 22)</b><br/>Today you identify with your possessions, which is why you will take care of something, or you might not want to lend it to anyone. You will check out your online banking to stay on top of your wealth and your assets. “What’s my money scene?”</p>
      <p><b>Leo (July 23 — Aug. 22)</b><br/>It’s Monday and the moon is in your sign, which gives you a slight advantage over all the other signs. Therefore, if there is something you want — today is the day to ask for it because you might get it! Run it up the flagpole to see if anyone salutes.</p>
      <p><b>Virgo (Aug. 23 — Sept. 22)</b><br/>You’re entering this week slowly. You want to psychologically protect yourself from the busy insanity around you, which is why you will prefer to work alone or behind the scenes. Like wading into a cold lake, you’re going to take your time entering this week.</p>
      <p><b>Libra (Sept. 23 — Oct. 22)</b><br/>A conversation with a female could be important today. Certainly, you will sit down with someone and share your hopes and dreams for the future with them. If so, listen to their feedback because it could help. It might even send you in a new direction?</p>
      <p><b>Scorpio (Oct. 23 — Nov. 21)</b><br/>Today you are high viz. whether you are aware of this or not. People notice you, especially people in power — bosses, parents, teachers, VIPs and the police. However, the odds are they see you in a positive light, which means you can use this to your advantage. Make your pitch!</p>
      <p><b>Sagittarius (Nov. 22 — Dec. 21)</b><br/>You always want to expand your horizons and do something exciting and stimulating. Today is no exception. Therefore, do something different. Talk to people from different backgrounds; go someplace you’ve never been before. Obviously, if you can travel — get outta Dodge!</p>
      <p><b>Capricorn (Dec. 22 — Jan. 19)</b><br/>It’s Monday and it’s the perfect day to tackle red-tape details regarding taxes, debt, insurance issues and anything to do with shared property. Be proactive. Get on top of this stuff before it buries you. It’s empowering to know what you owe and what you own. “Just the facts, ma’am.”</p>
      <p><b>Aquarius (Jan. 20 — Feb. 18)</b><br/>Because the moon is in a sign that is opposite your sign today, it means you have to go more than halfway when dealing with others. This simply requires a bit of largesse, patience and accommodation, all of which you have in abundance.</p>
      <p><b>Pisces (Feb. 19 — March 20)</b><br/>You are personally ambitious to be better organized today. This is why you will examine what you’re doing and how you’re doing it because you want to work smart. In other words, you want the best bang for your buck — results for your efforts. Bravo! Examine how you live.</p>
      <p><b>If your birthday is today</b><br/>Author Margaret Atwood (1939) shares your birthday today. You are charming and charismatic and always calm and collected. You are industrious and have a sharp, penetrating mind. This is a year of fast action, change and new opportunities. Expect adventure and stimulating situations. You will have chances to travel and expand your world as you learn new things. Embrace change. Let your personal freedom be your goal this year.</p>
