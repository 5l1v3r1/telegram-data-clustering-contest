      <p>This kitchen ingredient is an age-old remedy for hair loss and thinning. While it stimulates blood flow to the scalp, it also nourishes the hair follicles to promote faster and healthier new growth. Not only that, but it also acts as a great alternative to store-bought conditioner. We thank the high mucilage content – which provides smoothness like conditioner and makes detangling after hair wash very easy. And if you have parched or frizzy hair, fenugreek comes to your rescue. Regular use of this herb as a hair mask or a deep conditioner will naturally soften your hair and restore lustre and bounce.</p>
      <p>In addition, fenugreek has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that help with dandruff, scalp irritation and acne. And, if you are losing hair due to menopause, we highly recommend fenugreek since it is high in estrogens and thus will help prevent hair from thinning.</p>
