      <h1>Floyd Mayweather's two-fight plan including one bout against UFC star</h1>
      <h2>Mayweather announced his comeback this week and reportedly plans to fight twice in 2020 - possibly against Manny Pacquaio and a UFC star</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:55:49+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather is reportedly planning to fight twice next year - including one bout against a UFC star.</p>
      <p>The ring legend announced on Thursday that he will come out of retirement in 2020, almost three years since he stopped <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> .</p>
      <p>He will work with UFC president Dana White after the pair were courtside this week to see the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Boston Celtics.</p>
      <p>And according to TMZ, Mayweather wants to fight in May and September - the Mexican holidays he made his own in Las Vegas during the prime of his career.</p>
      <p>Old rival Manny Pacquiao - who remains a world champion following his win over Keith Thurman is July - is believed to be one of this primary targets.</p>

      <p>The pair finally met in the ring in 2015 following years of squabbling with Mayweather running out a comfortable winner on points.</p>
      <p>Just this week a judge threw out a case brought by fans who wanted to sue after Pacquiao revealed he had fought with a shoulder injury.</p>
      <p>Mayweather, according to TMZ, then wants to fight a UFC star, in particular one who excels in stand-up, like McGregor.</p>
      <p>That would appear to rule out lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov who called out Mayweather after his own victory over McGregor last year.</p>

      <p>The same report claims Mayweather wants to fight at the brand new Raiders' stadium which is due to open next summer and will be home to Las Vegas' first NFL side.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old's announcement this week was met with scepticism given the number of times Mayweather has announced a 'comeback'.</p>
      <p>And indeed, his social media post came just hours after he said he would return to the sport following a spate of deaths.</p>
      <p>"Iâ€™ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth," Mayweather told Reuters. "Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>
      <p>"You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career."</p>
