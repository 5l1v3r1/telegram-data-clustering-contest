      <p>The Uruguayan, now in his sixth season at the Camp Nou, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/luis-suarez-barcelona-spell-coming-to-an-end_378867.html">recently admitted</a> that his time at the club was nearing its end.</p>
      <p>Following a remarkable 2015-16 season during which Suarez scored 40 La Liga goals, the striker's total has decreased with each passing season, prompting many to claim that he no longer possesses the same sharpness in front of goal.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>ESPN</i> about the MLS, Suarez said: "MLS is a competition which has grown a lot in the last few years and you can see that with the young players that have moved there in the last two years, above all the South Americans.</p>
      <p>"That shows that the league wants to grow and not just bring in players of a certain age that are going to retire there. They look for that mix to make the league better.</p>
      <p>"I have a contract with Barca and I am very happy here. In the future you never know, it's an attractive league."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barcelona/transfer-talk/news/barcelona-make-martinez-top-transfer-target_375862.html">Reports have claimed</a> that Barcelona view Inter Milan striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lautaro-martinez/"><b>Lautaro Martinez</b></a> as their ideal candidate to replace Suarez over the summer.</p>
