      <h1>Psychology behind Frozen 2 explains why kids love the movie series so much</h1>
      <h2>Ever wondered why those Frozen 2 trailers are so memorising, well maybe there's a deeper force drawing you in</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:03:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:03</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Dodd, https://www.facebook.com/JournoDodd/</a></address>
      <p>Frozen is more than a film, it's a full blown phenomena.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/frozen">Frozen fever</a> swept the UK back in 2013, it had this way of drawing the fans in like nothing else before.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/">film</a> was produced by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/walt-disney">Walt Disney</a> Animation Studios, similarly to the popular Disney hit Tangled, but it still felt like there was something different about Frozen.</p>
      <p>The hit film seemed to incorporate both the traditional folk story telling of Hans Christian Anderson, with cutting edge animation and visuals, making for an instant classic.</p>
      <p>But psychologists and film buffs have also posited their reasons for the original films appeal, the most notable being an article by Maryam Kia-Keating and Yalda T.Uhls in the Washington post, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/01/06/why-little-girls-are-so-completely-obsessed-with-frozen/">'The Psychology of why little kids are completely obsessed with 'Frozen'?'</a> (2015).</p>
      <p>With the release of the sequel just days away, we ask what is about part two that will keep kids hooked, what feelings will it bring up for them, and will a return to the icy world of Elsa and Anna prove just as enchanting?</p>
      <h3>Rebellion and the Sublime</h3>

      <p>As the titular song from the first movie says, children do love to 'Let it Go', but in Frozen 2 we will see Elsa try to hold back the very tide itself.</p>
      <p>As we saw from the first movie, children relate to that feeling of being told how to behave, and wanting to simply be free of that burdon.</p>
      <p>Frozen teaches children it's OK to let your hair down, it's OK to feel overwhelmed and want to be on your own for a while, and it's OK not to want to conform to everyone's expectation.</p>
      <p>But from what we've seen of the sequel Elsa looks even more conflicted, as she prepares to go 'Into the Unknown' (from what we've seen of the soundtrack).</p>
      <p>As she climbs the waves beyond the safe confines of Arendale, one theory is that of the sublime, or feeling small when stacked against the uncontrollable forces of nature.</p>
      <p>Children also get this feeling of being small when placed against those larger than them, like an adult, which perhaps might explain why they relate to Elsa.</p>
      <p>We know she's going to once again rebel in order to discover who she truly is and possibly her parents past, but the scene within the waves is a nice way of capturing how we all feel as children- small and up against the waves.</p>
      <h3>Identity</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There is no underestimating the significance of Elsa's first physical transformation, from starched clothes and pinned up hair to a loose gown and new hairstyle.</p>
      <p>But in the sequel we will hear Elsa singing about 'not being where she is meant to be' which is significant, as many children often feel they do not belong, whether at home or at school.</p>
      <p>We will also see the Queen change from a dress, to a more practical icy trouser suit, and this demonstrates a duality in the character, that she can be both delicate, and vulnerable but also incredible endearing and strong.</p>
      <p>This scene will also speak to how children are more comfortable choosing their own style, and why this film is capable of transcending many of the gender norms placed on young children.</p>
      <p>Elsa is someone who forms her own identity, and for many children still trying to figure out who they will grow up to be, this is very empowering.</p>
      <h3>Siblings</h3>

      <p>In Frozen 2 we will hear Elsa say "you can't just follow me into fire" to which her sister replies "Then don't run into fire".</p>
      <p>It's eerily similar to that old saying siblings like to throw about 'if I told you to run into a fire would you?".</p>
      <p>Maryam Kia-Keating writes in the Washington Post, that the Frozen film is one of few Disney films that places a larger emphasis on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/01/06/why-little-girls-are-so-completely-obsessed-with-frozen/">familial bond between siblings</a> , in this case sisters, over the romantic bond between say a 'prince and princess'.</p>
      <p>This is something that has helped make Frozen a family affair, with siblings generally attaching themselves with the princess they most relate to, e.g older siblings relating to Elsa.</p>
      <p>In our formative years our siblings (and often our school friends) help shape our idea of right and wrong, as they are standout authoritative figures outside of our parents.</p>
      <p>The older sibling generally will have more responsibility placed upon them, and in Elsa's case as future Queen she's often told what to do, and to care for her sister.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20334244.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_FROZEN-2.jpg"/>

      <p>There are many times when children see Elsa fail to protect Anna, and many older children can relate to that feeling of being scolded when they fail.</p>
      <p>In reverse younger children often relate to Anna's feelings of frustration, particularly when she feels left out, or like she's too young to understand why people might be getting frustrated with her.</p>
      <p>There's also the idea that our differences as siblings often hopelessly outweigh the similarities, and this film teaches children about celebrating their strengths as a team.</p>
      <p>But all in all this sister act is one of the reasons that young girls prefer the film to more romantic Disney princess films, and Frozen 2 which looks set to explore Anna's development further, is one of the reasons you're unlikely to escape.</p>
      <h3>Trust</h3>

      <p>A reporter for <a href="http://www.feministfiction.com/2014/01/13/an-open-door-love-at-first-sight-in-disneys-frozen/">Feminist Fiction</a> wrote that one of the major psychological aspects of the film is the idea of trust, and how we form relationships.</p>
      <p>In Frozen 2 we see Elsa riding a water horse, but why a horse? Horses are creatures that can be wild and unpredictable, yet fiercely loyal and intelligent.</p>
      <p>They are animals that humans have to build trust with, and given the number of studies into the effect of animals on child therapy, the inclusion of a horse in the film might not be an accident (mythology aside)</p>
      <p>Frozen was also one of the first films to call out the 'happily ever after', 'married at first sight' nature of Disney films, often with devastatingly sad ends.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>When Anna is betrayed by Hanz, the writers focus on the idea of getting to know someone, and that not everyone will be as honest as they appear.</p>
      <p>Naturally trust is a lesson that all children must learn, particularly when it comes to those around them and staying safe.</p>
      <p>In Frozen 2 we will see trust being tested in a new way, as we will see Anna have to work with her sister and trust her in times of struggle.</p>
      <p>We will also see new friendships formed as Anna and Olaf continue to remain the best of friends, and Elsa makes a few new animal friends of her own.</p>
