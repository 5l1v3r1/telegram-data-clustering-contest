      <p>The 2019 <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Survivor Series pay-per-view will take place in Chicago, Illinois on Sunday, November 24.</p>
      <p>Eight matches have been confirmed for the show, including Brock Lesnar vs. Rey Mysterio (WWE Championship), “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt vs. Daniel Bryan (Universal Championship) and Adam Cole vs. TBA (NXT Championship).</p>
      <p>The following RAW vs. SmackDown vs. NXT elimination matches have also been announced: Team RAW (Charlotte Flair, Natalya, Asuka, Kairi Sane and Sarah Logan) vs. Team SmackDown (Sasha Banks, Carmella, Dana Brooke, Lacey Evans and Nikki Cross) vs. Team NXT (TBA), and Team RAW (Seth Rollins, Drew McIntyre, Kevin Owens, Randy Orton and Ricochet) vs. Team SmackDown (Roman Reigns, Mustafa Ali, Braun Strowman, King Corbin and Shorty G) vs. Team NXT (TBA).</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the card, three Champion vs. Champion vs. Champion matches will also take place: Becky Lynch (RAW Women's Champion) vs. Bayley (SmackDown Women's Champion) vs. Shayna Baszler (NXT Women's Champion), AJ Styles (United States Champion) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura (Intercontinental Champion) vs. Roderick Strong (NXT North American Champion), and The Viking Raiders (RAW Tag Team Champions) vs. The New Day (SmackDown Tag Team Champions) vs. The Undisputed Era (NXT Tag Team Champions).</p>
      <p>In this article, let’s try to predict the outcome of all eight matches at this year's Survivor Series.</p>

      <h4>#8 Brock Lesnar vs. Rey Mysterio (WWE Championship)</h4>

      <p>Before Paul Heyman announced the No Holds Barred stipulation, it looked as though <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/brock-lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a> vs. <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rey-mysterio">Rey Mysterio</a> could turn out to be another quick victory for “The Beast”. After all, it only took him nine seconds to defeat Kofi Kingston last month, while Mysterio lasted just 60 seconds against Samoa Joe at WrestleMania 35.</p>
      <p>Heyman has been known as the best on-screen promoter in WWE for the last seven years, and his magnificent tag line for this match – “Massacre or Miracle?” – made for a pleasant change from his usual “spoiler” promo.</p>
      <p>The new stipulation means anything goes at Survivor Series, which opens up the possibility of Dominik or Cain Velasquez getting involved to help out Mysterio and essentially turn the match into a handicap match.</p>
      <p>That being said, regardless of whether or not the numbers game is against Lesnar, it feels like we are far too early in his WWE Championship reign for him to lose the title on Sunday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Prediction: Brock Lesnar def. Rey Mysterio</b>
