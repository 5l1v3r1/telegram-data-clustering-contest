      <p>Visibility may have been one of the talking points in the run-up to the first Day/Night Test in India but BCCI president <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sourav-ganguly/">Sourav Ganguly</a> feels sighting the pink ball is “easier” than the red cherry.</p>
      <p>There had been plenty of talks around the heavily-lacquered ball especially during the twilight hours.</p>
      <p>Asked about visibility, the former India captain said: “It’s actually easier than the red ball.”</p>
      <p>Ganguly remained non-committal on whether India will play a pink ball Test in Australia next year.</p>
      <p>Ganguly, who was the man behind India hosting its maiden Day/Night Test after initial resistance, was delighted with the big turnout at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>“So many watched the match that is most important. I was not under any tension but I was busy.”</p>
      <p>Ganguly thanked Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for her presence on Friday, and promised to be present at the two T20Is between Asian all-star XI and World XI next year to celebrate the 100th birth anniversary of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.</p>
      <p>“I will go. I know you have gala plans for the event,” he said.</p>
