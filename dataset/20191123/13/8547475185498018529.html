        <b>The Labour leader has defended his decision to adopt a neutral stance on Brexit and refusal to say if he would back remain or leave in another referendum.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has called his stance "a sign of strength" and "maturity".</p>
      <p>Speaking on a campaign visit to Sheffield on Saturday, Mr Corbyn said: "I think being an honest broker and listening to everyone is actually a sign of strength and a sign of maturity.</p>
      <p>"Our country has to come together, we can't go on forever being divided by how people voted in 2016.</p>
      <p>He continued: "My role as the Labour prime minister would be to ensure that another referendum is carried out in a fair way, that the offers put are fair, and that I will carry out the result of that referendum.</p>
      <p>"I think this is actually a sensible way forward that can bring people together."</p>
      <p>On Friday night, the <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/politics/uk/election-2019/general-election-2019-party-leaders-tv-debate/">Labour leader said in a Question Time leaders special </a>that he would act as an "honest broker" of his party wins power on December 12.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn said that he believed this was the most "sensible way forward".</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned his decision and said he could not be "indifferent" on such a crucial issue.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson accused the move of being an "absence of leadership".</p>
      <p>However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Labour leader's stance "won't wash" with the electorate.</p>
      <p>"He has actively decided to be indecisive on the biggest issue of the day. It won't wash with voters," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think it is an absolute disaster. You can't ask this country to be its prime minister while not having a view on the biggest issue of the day."</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has promised a new Brexit deal with the EU and a second referendum with this new deal if he becomes Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>On Friday, he confirmed that he would maintain a neutral stance in this referendum and carry out whatever result is chosen.</p>
