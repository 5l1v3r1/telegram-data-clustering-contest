      <p>The House Financial Services Committee, Task Force on Artificial Intelligence, has scheduled a hearing for December 6th. The hearing is entitled,  “Robots on Wall Street: The Impact of AI on Capital Markets and Jobs in the Financial Services Industry.”</p>

      <p>The AI Task Force is expected to research and review the following issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Applications of machine learning in financial services and regulation</li>
        <li>Algorithms and Big Data: emerging risk management perspectives</li>
        <li>AI, Digital Identification Technologies and Combatting Fraud</li>
        <li>Automation and its impact on jobs in financial services and the overall economy</li>
