      <p>Cape Town - Former Proteas batsman <b>Hashim Amla</b> believes that <b>Kolpak</b> deals are not the reason for South African cricket's slump this season.</p>
      <p>The Proteas' poor performance has been in the spotlight following a seventh-place finish at the Cricket World Cup and their 3-0 Test series defeat to India.</p>
      <p>Amla, who <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/Proteas/hashim-amla-retires-from-international-cricket-20190808">retired</a> from international duty after the World Cup in England, did not partake in South Africa's tour to India last month.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <b><i>PakPassion.net</i> <a href="http://pakpassion.net/component/content/article.html?id=7137&amp;Itemid=0">website</a></b>, Amla admitted that he was "amused" by South African cricket blaming Kolpak deals for their woes.</p>
      <p>"I find it very amusing whenever this whole subject of Kolpak and its effects on South Africa cricket are brought up. Kolpak has been around for a long time, and so it's surprising to me that it is been touted as the reason for all evils only because we lost the recent Test series to India," he told the Pakistani <a href="http://pakpassion.net/component/content/article.html?id=7137&amp;Itemid=0">publication</a>.</p>
      <p>"I do not want this idea to become a convenient excuse for what basically were bad performances against India...</p>
      <p>"Let's be honest about it, India are a really good side and they will probably beat all teams at home and the fact is that we did not play that well during the tour."</p>
      <p>Amla admitted that he is not entirely blameless, as the batsman <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Cricket/Proteas/hashim-amla-signs-two-year-kolpak-deal-20191029">penned a two-year Kolpak contract</a> to join Surrey.</p>
      <p>"... My story is slightly different as I have a few years of international cricket under my belt. The fact remains that this whole issue has gained importance just due to recent bad performances," he said.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old is currently in the United Arab Emirates competing as an icon player and captain of the T10 League side, Karnataka Tuskers.</p>
      <p>The Tuskers failed to make the playoffs as they finished at the bottom of Group A. Amla only managed to score 105 runs from his 6 games.</p>
