      <h1>What channel is Ohio State vs. Penn State on today? Time, schedule for Big Ten showdown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:20:13+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">James Crabtree-Hannigan</a></address>
      <p>Some of the luster has been knocked off the Week 13 matchup between No. 2 Ohio State and No. 9 Penn State due to the Nittany Lions losing to Minnesota, but there's still a lot on the line in one of the biggest games on Saturday's schedule.</p>
      <p>The clash in Columbus serves as a de facto Big Ten West title game. A Buckeyes victory would clinch the division, and if Penn State wins, all it would need is a win over lowly Rutgers next week to secure a spot in the Big Ten championship.</p>

      <p>The Buckeyes have been universally dominant this season, their closest win being a 34-10 triumph over Michigan State. But a Penn State team with its back against the wall may post the biggest challenge yet.</p>
