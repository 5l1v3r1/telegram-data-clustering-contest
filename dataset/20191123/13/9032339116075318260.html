      <p><i>The Crown</i> <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a14307181/the-crown-season-3-news-date-cast-spoilers/">Season 3</a> introduces an unexpected suitor in the mix of eligible young royals: Andrew Parker Bowles.</p>
      <p>We first see the royal affiliate (portrayed by Andrew Buchan of <i>Broadchurch</i> and <i>All the Money in the World</i>) in Episode 8, when he's dumped by <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29601605/prince-charles-camilla-parker-bowles-relationship-timeline/">Camilla Shand</a> (Emerald Fennell) but promptly rebounds with <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a29834022/the-crown-season-3-erin-doherty-interview/">Princess Anne</a> (Erin Doherty). By the end of the season—spoiler alert—Camilla ends her romance with <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a29831969/the-crown-season-3-prince-charles-interview/">Prince Charles</a> and goes running back to Andrew.</p>
      <p>So who is this integral fourth member of the tricky <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a29763723/the-crown-charles-camilla-anne-andrew-love-quadrangle/">royal love quadrangle</a>, real-life military veteran, and former husband to the now-Duchess of Cornwall? Below are the basics on Andrew Parker Bowles.</p>
      <h3>He served in the military.</h3>
      <p>Parker Bowles graduated from Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and became a lieutenant in the Blues and Royals regiment of the Royal Horse Guards, <i><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2001/10/a-court-of-his-own-200110">Vanity Fair</a></i> reported. He was an officer in The Household Cavalry and Royal Army Veterinary Corps from 1960 to 1995, according to the <a href="http://www.animalsinwar.org.uk/index.cfm?asset_id=1391">Animal in War Memorial Fund</a>, an organization where he serves as vice chairman.</p>
      <h3>He has a lot of connections with the royal family.</h3>
      <p>According to<i> Vanity Fair</i>, "His father was a close friend of the Queen Mother’s, his mother was chief commissioner of the Girl Guides (Britain’s Girl Scouts), and Andrew had been a page at Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, in 1953."</p>

      <h3>He and Camilla Shand met at a party.</h3>
      <p>Parker Bowles and Shand first met at a debutante party in 1965, according to royal biographer Penny Junor, who documented the now-duchess's life. However, <i>Vanity Fair</i> reports that they met in 1966, when Shand was 19 years old and Parker Bowles was 27. They dated for seven years before getting hitched.</p>
      <p>Camilla reportedly met Prince Charles in 1970.</p>
      <h3>They were married from 1973 to 1995.</h3>
      <p>Andrew and Camilla tied the knot at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks on July 4, 1973. They had two children together: Thomas, born in 1974, and Laura, born in 1978. Through their kids, the former couple share <a href="https://www.royal.uk/the-duchess-of-cornwall">five grandchildren</a>.</p>

      <p>Despite being in separate marriages, Camilla and Charles stayed connected, and reportedly rekindled their romance in 1986, according to <i><a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-charles-camillas-love-story/?slide=5807039#5807039">People</a></i>. Private tapes of the duo's intimate telephone call in 1989 was leaked in 1993, confirming their affair.</p>
      <p>When Andrew and Camilla Parker Bowles announced their divorce, they were already living apart for two years, <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/11/world/other-woman-in-royal-affair-plans-divorce.html">The New York Times</a> </i>reported<i>.</i> They said the reason for their separation was that "there is little of common interest between us," according to a statement from their lawyers. Prince Charles and Princess Diana <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/13/world/charles-and-diana-agree-on-divorce-terms.html">finalized their divorce in 1996</a>.</p>
      <h3>Parker Bowles remarried in 1996.</h3>
      <p>Camilla married Prince Charles and became the Duchess of Cornwall in 2005, but her first husband moved on much earlier.</p>
      <p>Parker Bowles married Rosemary Pitman, a garden designer who was also previously married, a year after his marriage with Camilla was dissolved. She'd had three children with her previous husband.</p>

      <p>Andrew and Rose remained on good terms with Camilla and Charles despite their romantic entanglements. According to <i><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuknews%2Ftheroyalfamily%2F6976319%2FRosemary-Parker-Bowles-dies-after-battle-against-cancer.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Fcelebrity%2Flatest%2Fa29894814%2Fwho-is-andrew-parker-bowles-camilla-ex-husband%2F">The Telegraph</a></i>, they joined the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall at Sandringham, the queen's country estate, "on a number of occasions."</p>
      <p>Pitman died of cancer in 2010 at the age of 69.</p>
      <h3>He apparently had a fling with Princess Anne.</h3>
      <p>There may be some truth behind Anne and Andrew's onscreen romance in <i>The Crown, </i>although it was never publicly confirmed by either party in real life.</p>
      <p>"This is really funny. Princess Anne, who we always think is the grumpy one with the bun – she had an affair with Andrew Parker Bowles," royal commentator Angela Mollard said in the podcast <i>Royals, </i>per <i><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1094815/royal-news-camilla-parker-bowles-husband-andrew-princess-anne-spt">Express</a></i>. "There was a royal triangle going on."</p>

      <p>Similarly, royal biographer Penny Junor <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4942390/Camilla-got-Charles-make-husband-jealous.html">said</a> that Camilla linked up with Prince Charles to get back at Andrew, who was reportedly known to attract a lot of women. "[She] thought, ‘Andrew is at the moment off with Princess Anne, you know her brother, teach Andrew a lesson.’ So she had a fling with Charles," Junor revealed in 2016.</p>
      <p>In 1970, Andrew Parker Bowles accompanied Princess Anne to during Royal Ascot week and stayed as a guest at Windsor Castle, but it seems things didn't get too serious. <i>Vanity Fair</i> reported, "Although he was Catholic and Anne would have had to renounce her right to the throne to marry him, there was much talk of a growing romance between the winning lieutenant and the Queen’s only daughter."</p>
      <h3>He's the godfather to Princess Anne's daughter, and his son is Prince Charles's godson.</h3>
      <p>Parker Bowles is a godfather to Zara Phillips (now Zara Tindall), the daughter of Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips. Meanwhile, his and Camilla's son, Tom, is the godson of Prince Charles.</p>
