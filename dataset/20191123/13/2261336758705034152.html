      <p>The UFC will return the O2 Arena in London, England for a Fight Night event on March 21, 2020, the premiere fight promotion announced on Friday, per the UFC’s official Europe Twitter page.</p>

      <p>UFC International Senior Vice President David Shaw added the following statement.</p>
      <p>“We’re delighted to be returning to London, our fans are fantastic and have always shown up in their thousands to support their local heros,” Shaw said, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/mixed-martial-arts/50513600">per the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Although no fights have been made official, it’s rumored that Liverpudlian Darren Till will take on former UFC middleweight champ Robert Whittaker in the main event. Till headlined the UFC London 2019 card this past March against Jorge Masvidal, losing via second-round knockout in a highly entertaining <i>Fight of the Night</i>. Since then, Till has moved up to 185-pounds and cemented himself as a top-five middleweight contender, beating Kelvin Gastelum via split decision in the UFC 244 co-main event at Madison Square Garden, New York.</p>
      <p>Whittaker, on the other hand, will look to rebound from his knockout loss to Israel Adesanya at UFC 243. Prior to that, the Aussie was on a whopping nine-fight win streak, beating Yoel Romero in back-to-back fights and earning stoppage victories over the likes of ‘Jacare’ Souza and Derek Brunson.</p>
