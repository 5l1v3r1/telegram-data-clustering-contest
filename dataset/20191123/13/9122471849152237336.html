      <h1>Urban Meyer Has Bold Prediction For Ohio State-Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:52:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>In just a few hours one of the biggest college football games of the season will kick off from Columbus. No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in a battle of College Football Playoff contenders.</p>
      <p>The winner will take a stranglehold on the Big Ten East and likely represent the division in the conference’s title game.</p>
      <p>Ohio State enters as a heavy favorite – 19 points to be exact. Las Vegas clearly doesn’t think this one will be close.</p>
      <p>Neither does former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer. He thinks the scheduled played out perfectly for the Buckeyes, who enter this game at full strength, while the Nittany Lions are banged up at key positions.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://www.elevenwarriors.com/ohio-state-football/2019/11/109243/urban-meyer-on-ohio-states-game-against-penn-state-i-dont-think-this-will-be-close">11 Warriors</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I don’t think this will be close. The way the schedule is set up this year for Ohio State is perfect. They’re as healthy, as fresh as you can be. That is so key. Penn State’s had a little bit of a war, and their guys are banged up a little bit.”</blockquote>
      <p>The last three games between these two teams were won by no more than a field goal. However, the Buckeyes are expected to demolish their opponent today.</p>
      <p>Ohio state and Penn State kick off at 12:00 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
