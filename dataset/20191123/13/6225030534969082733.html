      <p>As the 2019-2020 Championship Meet at Gulfstream Park approaches its Friday, Nov. 29 opening, racing’s top horsemen have begun making the trek to South Florida for the country’s premiere winter Thoroughbred meet.</p>
      <p>Year-round residents of Gulfstream’s backstretch are being joined by names such as Todd Pletcher, winner of 15 consecutive Championship Meet training titles from 2004-2018; Kevin Attard, Mike DePaulo, Mark Hennig, Linda Rice, Dale Romans, Phil Serpe, Mike Tomlinson and Mike Trombetta.</p>
      <p>Horsemen stabled at Palm Meadows, Gulfstream’s satellite training center in Palm Beach County, include Jorge Navarro, who ended Pletcher’s streak with his first career Gulfstream title last winter; three-time defending Eclipse Award winner Chad Brown, who trained 2019 Horse of the Year candidate Bricks and Mortar; Kentucky Derby (G1) winners Michael Matz, Graham Motion, John Servis and Barclay Tagg; and Preakness (G1) winner Mark Casse and fellow Canadian Hall of Famer Josie Carroll.</p>
      <p>Rusty Arnold, Tom Bush, Danny Gargan, Stanley Hough, Jimmy Jerkens, Eddie Kinneally, Brian Lynch, Kiaran McLaughlin, Jason Servis, Jimmy Toner, Brendan Walsh, Wesley Ward and Ian Wilkes are other notable names that will have a string at Palm Meadows. Gargan conditions multiple graded-stakes winner Tax, nominated to the $200,000 Claiming Crown Jewel Dec. 7 at Gulfstream.</p>
      <p>Among the new names at Palm Meadows this winter are Rodolphe Brisset, Ben Colebrook, Ray Handal and Fausto Gutierrez, the latter having won the $300,000 Clasico del Caribe for 3-year-olds the past two years at Gulfstream with Jala Jala and Kukulkan.</p>
      <p>“Motion just got in, Matz just got in, and Chad’s here,” former trainer and Palm Meadows’ stable manager Mike Petro said. “Right after Thanksgiving, all the Kentucky horsemen start coming in and what’s left in New York will come down.”</p>
