      <p>Some of the most senior bureaucrats in the government scrambled to act on Prime Minister Scott Morrison's demand for gender neutral bathrooms to be removed from his department.</p>

      <p>Internal emails obtained under freedom of information laws – but heavily redacted – reveal deputy and assistant secretaries worked into the night after Mr Morrison seized on a tweet by a high-profile journalist and insisted the "ridiculous" bathroom signs be taken down.</p>
      <p>Deputy secretaries Stephanie Foster, David Gruen and Simon Duggan, acting chief people officer Rosie Hunt‐Walshe, first assistant secretary Paul Wood and then assistant secretary Susan Fitzgerald were among the senior bureaucrats drawn into the toilet controversy.</p>
      <p>"I'll be in early tomorrow and have cleared my diary as much as possible, so I am on hand for any conversations required with Stephanie and/or the Network about next steps," Ms Hunt-Walshe wrote at 6.45pm after dealing with the issue for several hours.</p>
      <p>The matter came to public attention on August 29 when Nine News political editor Chris Uhlmann tweeted a photograph of a toilet door sign at the department's Canberra offices telling staff: "Please use the bathroom that best fits your gender identity."</p>
      <p>The tweet was picked up by 2GB radio host Ben Fordham during his afternoon program.</p>
      <p>"[Fordham] has been talking about it for the last half-hour or so," the department's media office said in an email to senior officials. "We are getting an urgent transcript of that piece ... but he has mentioned asking the PM about it when he comes on the show this afternoon."</p>

      <p>Mr Morrison told Fordham he wanted the unisex bathrooms removed. "You don't need to do this stuff," he said. "It's just political correctness over the top. It's just not necessary."</p>
      <p>The department's media team also received inquiries from <i>The Australian</i>, the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the ABC and the <i>Herald </i>and <i>The Age</i>, who were told: "Apologies, but the department won't be making any public comment at this time."</p>
      <p>By 7pm, a bureaucrat whose identity was redacted emailed saying the secretary's office had been briefed on the issue.</p>
      <p>The documents show between 9pm and 10pm that evening Mr Gruen – deputy secretary for economic matters – was still sending emails about the toilet matter with his first assistant secretary Brenton Goldsworthy, chief adviser on economic policy Jason McDonald and Mr Duggan, the deputy secretary for industry and jobs.</p>
      <p>The documents also reveal the toilet issue had been discussed internally early that morning, several hours before Uhlmann's tweet, in emails marked "high" importance. However, most of the information in those emails was redacted.</p>
      <p>In total, the department identified 30 documents of internal correspondence relating to the toilet controversy that day. Only two were released in full.</p>
      <p>Under Australian FOI laws, material can be redacted if it is about "the deliberative process" – that is, weighing up competing arguments, and reflecting upon the wisdom or expediency of a proposal or decision.</p>

      <p>Information can also be redacted if an FOI officer believes it would unreasonably disclose personal information about a person, or if it could unreasonably and negatively affect someone's business affairs.</p>
      <p>All those reasons were used to redact dozens of pages of correspondence relating to gender neutral bathrooms.</p>
      <p>By law, FOI officers are also required to consider whether disclosure of information would be in the public interest.</p>
