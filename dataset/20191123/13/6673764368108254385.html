      <h1>A Le Loic: Inspired gelato comes to Tokyo Disney</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T13:42:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/author/patrick-st-michel/" target="_blank">Patrick St. Michel</a></address>
      <p>The Ikspiari shopping center right outside of Tokyo Disneyland houses a nice range of forgettable chain restaurants and trendier food options. The area’s newest dessert arrival falls squarely in the latter.</p>
      <p>Gelato store A Le Loic opened last week with a simple but memorable selection of the Italian dessert on sale. At the moment, it sells Earl Grey-fig, mango, caramel vanilla and strawberry flavors. These can be enjoyed in a cone or cup, either as a single (¥340 before tax) or a double offering (¥440 before tax).</p>
      <p>So far, pretty standard. Really, though, you should live it up and get multiple of these tasty flavors combined in a crepe (¥490 to ¥640 before tax, depending on what you stuff in there). Better yet, embrace the holiday spirit with the limited-edition Christmas Noel crepe (¥640 before tax), which features pistachio and raspberry gelato with sweet whipped cream. It’s the best combination of tastes at A Le Loic, and offers something slightly elevated from the usual gelato experience.</p>
