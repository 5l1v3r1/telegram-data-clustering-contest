      <p>Elliot Daly has no regrets over joining crisis club Saracens after celebrating his debut by starring in a 44-3 Champions Cup demolition of the Ospreys.</p>
      <p>The holders amassed six tries at Allianz Park to ignite their title defence a week after falling short at Racing 92, with Daly at the heart of an emphatic victory in his maiden appearance since the World Cup final on November 2.</p>
      <p>The England full-back joined up with his new team-mates for the first time on Monday at a backs social night in St Albans and was limited to only two training sessions during the week.</p>

      <p>Saracens have been docked 35 points in the Gallagher Premiership and fined £5.36million for breaching salary-cap regulations, but Daly has had no second thoughts over his high-profile summer move from Wasps.</p>
      <p>“No, definitely not. I needed a new challenge and coming to a club like this and having that opportunity is something you are never going to turn down,” Daly said.</p>
      <p>“Everyone here is moving in the right direction and are going to push me in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“For me it’s brilliant to come into a club now. We know what we need to do – we need to win every game.</p>
      <p>“But that hasn’t changed from what I’ve heard the Sarries mindset is – we go into every game trying to win.</p>

      <p>“We don’t change anything we do now. I’m just trying to add to this team in any way I can.</p>
      <p>“I’ve just enjoyed this week and I’ll try and enjoy the next four or five weeks and see where it takes us. Going out in St Albans was a good experience.</p>
      <p>“It was good to meet the boys and understand what makes them tick because when you get to tough days on the field that’s what comes out.</p>
      <p>“Everyone at the club has welcomed me with open arms, which is exactly what you want as a new player.</p>
      <p>“You want to play as many games for your new club and try to put your best foot forward.”</p>

      <p>McCall must prioritise the desperate fight for Premiership survival knowing his playing resources will be severely depleted by international call-ups during the Six Nations, but he insists a successful European title defence is possible.</p>
      <p>“We are still ambitious to do well in the competition and we still want to win the games,” McCall said.</p>
      <p>“We have just got some decisions to make along the way about when the internationals play and we will make some decisions along the way.</p>
      <p>“If we get through to the quarter-finals we’ve got a chance – a good chance – because in my experience this team in pretty good in knockout rugby.”</p>
