      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Bates, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/steve-bates/</a></address>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer claims Harry Maguire’s scrap to the top of English football makes him the perfect player for Sunday’s bear-pit battle with Sheffield United.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and England star Maguire might be the world’s most expensive defender at £80million.</p>
      <p>But his route to the top hasn’t been flashy after starting his days at the Blades academy and climbing up the ladder via Hull City, a loan spell at Wigan and two impressive seasons at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>
      <p>“I think the top academies are great, but sometimes you see a different type of player coming through the other route,” said Solskjaer.</p>

      <p>“Look at Jamie Vardy. Players sometimes find their own way and make a career instead of being in the academy.</p>
      <p>“For me, 100 per cent, I was the same. I have come through the back door myself and I like players with a different type of mentality.”</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s had no hesitation in making Maguire captain when first-choice skipper Ashley Young isn’t playing.</p>
      <p>“Harry has been different class on and off the pitch. As a leader, but also as a good person.</p>

      <p>“You can see players enjoy being in his company, they look up to him, not just because of his size, but also the type of lad he is.</p>
      <p>“Ashley is a natural leader in this group. He knows Manchester United, me, Michael Carrick and he knows the demands of being at United. He was a clear choice as captain. But, if he wasn’t here, then Harry would have been a close choice.”</p>
      <p>Scott McTominay is out injured, but Solskjaer believes the improving performances of £52million Fred are validation that United were right to persevere with the 26-year-old Brazilian after a poor debut season.</p>
      <p>“First, the price tag is none of Fred’s concern because that is just how football has gone. That shouldn’t be on Fred, that should be on us” said the United boss.</p>

      <p>“Fred’s now showing what we saw in him. He’s more confident, he believes in himself. He has creativity and tenacity and he’s shown in the last few games what his strengths are.”</p>
      <p>Despite being off the top-four pace, Solskjaer hasn’t given up on the Champions League.</p>
      <p>“I don’t agree the top four won’t change,” he added. “We’ve put ourselves in a difficult position.</p>
      <p>“But with Anthony Martial coming back, it gives us a big chance to claw back some points.”</p>
