      <h1>Borussia Dortmund join transfer race to sign Tottenham teenager Troy Parrott</h1>
      <h2>The 17-year-old made his first-team debut for Spurs in their Carabao Cup game against Colchester in September and also won his first Republic of Ireland cap earlier this month</h2>

      <p>Borussia Dortmund want to get a jump on arch-rivals Bayern Munich in the race to land <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur youngster Troy Parrott.</p>
      <p>Dortmund have been boosted by the successful signing of England international Jadon Sancho from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> two years ago, and are looking to potentially repeat the trick with the signing of the highly-rated Parrott.</p>
      <p>They are ready to go head-to-head with Bayern, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> to sign the 17-year-old, who Spurs bought as a schoolboy from Irish side Belvedere two years ago.</p>
      <p>Republic of Ireland cap Parrott, who has been likened to England captain Harry Kane, made his only first-team appearance against Colchester in this seasonâ€™s Carabao Cup.</p>

      <p>He also helped Ireland to a win against New Zealand on his senior debut for his country earlier this month, creating an assist in their 2-1 win.</p>
      <p>He has impressed at youth level, and signed his first professional contract with Spurs in February.</p>
      <p>That runs out in 2021, however, and some of Europe's elite clubs are looking to take advantage of the situation.</p>
      <p>The top German clubs are keeping a close eye on young English talent, and Bayern tried to swoop for Chelsea's Callum Hudson-Odoi in the last two windows before he eventually signed a new long-term deal with the Blues in September.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen what new Spurs manager Jose Mourinho makes of talent, and whether he sees him as a potential challenger for first-team places in the near future.</p>

      <p>Parrott did not get off to the best of starts with Mourinho, however, when he allegedly 'liked' a post on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> criticising the Portuguese manager.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/tottenham-striker-troy-parrott-likes-jose-mourinho-dig-mauricio-pochettino-sacking-11186829/">Metro</a> reported that a post which read: "Troy Parrott come to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> you're 'f****** with Jose" was 'liked' by Parrott, before he seemingly quickly changed his mind and undid the action.</p>
