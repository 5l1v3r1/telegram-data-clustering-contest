      <h1>Michael O'Neill hails "great start" to Stoke reign</h1>
      <h2>New boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-oneill/"><b>Michael O'Neill</b></a> saluted his battling side as Stoke came from behind to beat Wigan 2-1 at home thanks to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mame-diouf/"><b>Mame Diouf</b></a>'s stoppage-time winner.</h2>

      <p>Second-half goals from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danny-batth/"><b>Danny Batth</b></a> and Mame Diouf cancelled out <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-morsy/"><b>Sam Morsy</b></a>'s first-half opener as the improving Potters made it successive wins since O'Neill took charge.</p>
      <p>O'Neill said: "Winning games like that get you of trouble, we really showed great character.</p>
      <p>"It's been a great start. It was a difficult game, which we anticipated. But we probably made life more than difficult than we would have liked.</p>
      <p>"But I'm delighted with the six points from the two games so far. At times the game wasn't pretty, but we dug in and showed our character.</p>
      <p>"It's always great to win so late in the game, it gives our supporters that extra wee lift and send them home happy."</p>
      <p>Skipper Morsy's 39th-minute strike, his first league goal for two years, put the visitors on course for what would have been only their second win in 30 away league matches.</p>
      <p>But defender Batth's 55th-minute equaliser, also his first goal for two years, and substitute Diouf's dramatic winner turned the game on its head.</p>
      <p>O'Neill, who also masterminded a welcome first home win for a month, added: "We started the game so well and should have been ahead.</p>
      <p>"But I told them not to let me down at half time â€“ and they didn't. There were a lot of positives from the second-half performance, but we're far from the finished article.</p>
      <p>"There were times in the game where Wigan were better than us, but you're going to need battling qualities in the game to get a result in the Championship.</p>
      <p>"The important thing is the players play with confidence. I think every squad benefits from being freshened up, but we'll have to let players go before we do that.</p>
      <p>"But we've only had three days training with the team, so we've not had a proper chance to look at all the players."</p>
      <p>Frustrated Latics manager Paul Cook was understandably deflated, especially after his team had looked well-placed to take a point on their travels.</p>
      <p>But Diouf's first goal since April 2018 sunk the Latics, who have now lost four of their last five league matches.</p>
      <p>Cook said: "It's a cruel game. Football is like that sometimes, but it's cruel. We're on the floor at the minute.</p>
      <p>"Do you sometimes get what you deserve? I don't know?</p>
      <p>"We've conceded a stoppage-time goal, I just feel sorry for the players and the supporters. It's painful, it really is.</p>
      <p>"The dressing room is not a good place at the moment as you can imagine, the players are all feeling really disappointed.</p>
      <p>"Was a draw a fair result? Stoke had certain spells of pressure where they came on very strong, but we managed that and missed a couple of good chances ourselves.</p>
      <p>"It's a brutal industry we're in. Our lads worked ever so hard today, but I can look at my players with immense pride. Is that good enough? That's for others to decide.</p>
      <p>"Our lads have given everything they've got. As a manager, when they do that, you don't have too many qualms.</p>
      <p>"I don't know how I can help them sometimes, other than shut my eyes and prey.</p>
      <p>"We've got to keeping working away, that's the nature of football. We've got to pick ourselves up. We've got to make sure we bounce back."</p>
