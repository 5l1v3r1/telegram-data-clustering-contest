      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:13:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author">By Alasdair Duncan</a></address>
      <p><i><b>Modern Family </b></i>star<b> Sarah Hyland </b>has shared a photo of herself that she says she once hated, in order to spread a message about insecurities and feeling comfortable in your own skin.</p>
      <p>The actress, who has been open about issues with chronic illness in the past, wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“To my fellow #invisibleillness warriors. It’s ok to be insecure about your body. Just remember to check in with yourself at least once a day and say thank you. Our bodies have endured unfathomable feats that our minds barely have time to comprehend what has actually happened.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sarah Hyland, who was born with a condition known as kidney dysplasia, underwent her first transplant in 2012, but it failed four years later, and <a href="https://people.com/health/sarah-hyland-inspires-photo-that-made-her-feel-insecure/">she spent close to a year on dialysis</a> preparing for another.</p>
      <p>The medication cause her to undergo significant weight loss while her face swelled, leading to significant tabloid speculation and criticism about her appearance.</p>
      <p>She went on to say in her recent Instagram post:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“With inflammation, excess water gain, and medications, my skin has a hard time bouncing back. I saw this picture and HATED it but quickly readjusted my attitude and decided to celebrate it. Love yourself and be patient. We are all stronger than we think we are.”</i>
