      <p>Senior Chhattisgarh BJP leader and former MP Dr Banshilal Mahto died of a liver-related ailment on Saturday, a party leader said. Mahto was 79 and is survived by his wife, two sons and four daughters. He was admitted in a private hospital in Hyderabad on November 15 and died in the afternoon while being shifted in a critical condition to Korba, he said.</p>
      <p>"As the air ambulance landed in Chakarbhata airstrip in Bilaspur district, doctors declared him dead. His mortal remains are being shifted to Korba by the road where his final rites will be performed on Sunday," he informed. An Ayurvedic doctor-turned-politician, Mahto was elected to Lok Sabha in 2014 from Korba, though he was denied a ticket by the BJP for the 2019 general elections.</p>
