      <p>A mother-of-two who confronted a man directing anti-Semitic abuse towards Jewish children on the London Underground said she “wouldn’t hesitate to do it again”.</p>
      <p>Asma Shuweikh, from London, told the PA news agency she wished more people on the Tube had stood up the man when he started being aggressive towards the young family.</p>
      <p>She said: “I would have loved more people to come up and say something, because if everyone did, I do not think it would have escalated in the way that it did.”</p>

      <p>The police are now investigating after a man was filmed reading anti-Jewish bible passages to two young boys in skullcaps while they were travelling with their family on the Northern Line.</p>
      <p>Wearing a cap and hoody, the man is seen in the video threatening a man off-camera after he tries to intervene before a woman in a hijab — Asma — confronts him.</p>
      <p>She said when she saw what was happening she knew she “had to confront him”.</p>
      <p>“Being a mother of two, I know what it’s like to be in that situation and I would want someone to help if I was in that situation,” she said.</p>
      <p>She said the couple was travelling with three children, and she wanted to deflect the man’s attention away from them.</p>

      <p>She said: “He was quite aggressive and was getting in my face.”</p>
      <p>Fellow commuter Chris Atkins took the video after catching the Tube heading south on the Charing Cross branch of the line at midday on Friday.</p>
      <p>“The Muslim woman didn’t take any shit from him and really, really took him to task, very firmly and persistently,” Mr Atkins said.</p>
      <p>“In this day and age we are told how intolerant everyone is and all religions hate each other and there you had a Muslim woman sticking up for some Jewish children.”</p>
      <p>Twitter users hailed Mrs Shuweikh a “hero”.</p>
      <p>Mrs Shuweikh said she got off the Tube after two stops and did not realise the video was going viral until a friend texted her to say she had seen her on Twitter.</p>

      <p>She created a Twitter account so she could see the reaction.</p>
      <p>She said: “It was so heartwarming to see the responses and see what people were saying. I can’t take all the credit because a lot of other people were involved.</p>
      <p>“I would not hesitate to do it again.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, the British Transport Police said: “We are aware of a video circulating on Twitter which shows passengers being harassed and being targeted with anti-Semitic abuse on a Northern Line train.</p>
      <p>“Enquiries are being made in relation to this footage.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who witnessed what happened, or who has any information, is asked to contact BTP by sending a text to 61016 or by calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 357 of 22/11.”</p>
