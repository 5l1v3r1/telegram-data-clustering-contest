      <h1>Hamas Leader Says Netanyahu's Indictment 'Raises Morale'</h1>
      <h2>Serious corruption charges against the Israeli prime minister mean more resistance, Ismail Haniyeh tells reporters in Gaza</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:42:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/writers/WRITER-1.4968124" target="_blank">The Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>The leader of the militant Hamas group says the corruption indictment of Israeli prime minister raises the Palestinian people’s morale.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-ismail-haniyeh-1.5598934">Ismail Haniyeh</a> told reporters in Rafah in southern Gaza Strip on Saturday that serious corruption charges against Benjamin Netanyahu were a sign “of more steadfastness” for the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>The leader of the group that controls <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-gaza-1.5599001">Gaza</a> also said the indictment means more “resistance, both popular and armed.”</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Israel’s Attorney General <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-charged-bribery-fraud-corruption-israel-election-1.8137771">indicted Netanyahu for fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes</a>, making him the first sitting premier to be charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>The longest-serving Israeli leader is scrambling after <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections">two inconclusive elections</a> this year and possibly an unprecedented third national vote early next year.</p>
      <p>The Islamist <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/misc/tags/TAG-hamas-1.5598922">Hamas</a> group won the 2006 Palestinian legislative polls, which were the last.</p>
