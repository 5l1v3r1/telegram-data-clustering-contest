      <p>UNCASVILLE, Conn. — The venue was different, but the performance was similar.</p>
      <p>A comfortable halftime lead vanished quickly. Offensive execution was nonexistent. Foul trouble to Josh Roberts weakened the defense.</p>
      <p>In many ways, Saturday’s 80-67 loss to Arizona State at Mohegan Sun was reminiscent to St. John’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/furious-st-johns-rally-falls-just-short-in-loss-to-vermont/">setback to Vermont</a> a week ago, only this was worse. The issues exposed in that loss were magnified significantly.</p>
      <p>The Johnnies seemed in control at the half, up nine points, before completely unraveling over the game’s final 20 minutes in all facets, blown out in the opening round of the Hall of Fame Tip Off Classic.</p>
      <p>Instead of getting a crack at defending national champion and No. 7 Virginia on Sunday, St. John’s will have to settle for the consolation game against UMass at 1 p.m.</p>
      <p>They committed 12 turnovers in the second half, shot 31 percent from the field and allowed the Sun Devils to explode for 47 after the break on 60 percent shooting. Most concerning, star guard Mustapha Heron’s recent struggles continued in a seven-point, 2-of-9 shooting performance as St. John’s lost to the Sun Devils for the third time in as many years.</p>
      <p>Against coach Bobby Hurley, the school’s first choice to replace Chris Mullin, the Johnnies took a major step back, suffering their first double-digit loss of the Mike Anderson era.</p>
      <p>The game took a sharp turn early in the second half, with Arizona State ripping off a 16-2 run that included 13 points from star guard Remy Martin. St. John’s never got closer than three the rest of the way. By the under-four timeout, Arizona State was up 15.</p>
      <p>LJ Figueroa led St. John’s with 17 points and Julian Champagnie had 15.</p>
