      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has promised to rectify a “historic injustice” in the general election after the Tories lifted the pension age threshold from 60 to 65 - leaving many on benefits or being forced to continue working</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Selby, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Labour will today pledge £57billion to women who were denied state pensions.</p>
      <p>Some 3.8million hit by pension age rises will get up to £31,300. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: “We see this as a debt of honour.”</p>
      <p>The people affected will be eligible for sums of up to £31,000.</p>
      <p>Lifting the threshold from 60 to 65 since 2010 had left many on benefits, while others had to work beyond the age they expected.</p>
      <p>The pledge to rectify a “historic injustice” is made by the Mr McDonnell and comes after women lost a High Court battle for justice.</p>
      <p>They claimed they did not have enough time to prepare for the age rise.</p>
      <p>Campaign groups Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) and Backto60 have led the battle.</p>

      <p>Mr McDonnell said of the so-called “Made in Dagenham” generation: “Some of the stories that I’ve heard around the country have been heartrending.</p>
      <p>"People feel a sense of injustice that they’ve lost what they thought was a basic contract between them and the Government, about their pension and when they retire.</p>
      <p>“They’ve worked all their lives and feel completely betrayed. They say ‘We weren’t properly consulted or informed.’ Resentment built up – that’s understandable.”</p>

      <p>The five-year policy will see women born between April 6, 1950 and April 6, 1959 receive £100 for each week of state pension they have lost.</p>
      <p>Anyone eligible will start receiving cash within months of a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> victory at the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>The news comes after PM <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> appeared to backtrack on a pledge to help the women.</p>
      <p>Mr McDonnell added: “We’re not talking about reversing the retirement age here. We’re talking about making sure people get justice.</p>

        <figcaption>The changes have meant some women are now on benefits or still working when they expected to have retired (Image: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“Many have had serious financial consequences, some hit by poverty and stress, others having lost out what they feel they’ve contributed towards.</p>
      <p>“Most of the women feel they’ve fulfilled their side of the bargain, but the Government tore up the contract without even telling them properly. There’s a real deep sense of injustice.</p>
      <p>“There are many women whose plans were thrown out of the window by the Government.</p>
      <p>“We’re treating this as a very special circumstance.</p>
      <p>“It’s a historic debt, a historic injustice. We see this as a debt of honour that we have got to fulfil.”</p>

      <p>Mr McDonnell said the £11.5billion a year over five years policy would be paid for out of normal taxation and be treated in the same way had the Government lost the High Court case.</p>
      <p>An online calculator will show how much women stand to receive and the money will be issued in instalments rather than a lump sum.</p>
      <p>The pension age for men and women rises to 66 by next October, to 67 by 2028 and is expected to have hit 68 between 2037 and 2039.</p>
