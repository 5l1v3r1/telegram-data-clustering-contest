      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Nick Endacott begged Bee Gees singer Maurice Gibb's family for a DNA test but was stunned to find the results proved they were a '100 percent match'</h2>

      <p>A musician who begged the family of Bee Gee Maurice Gibb for a DNA test has finally got evidence the singer was his dad.</p>
      <p>Nick Endacott sent a saliva swab to an online genealogy firm and was stunned when he received the result.</p>
      <p>Unknown to Nick, Maurice’s son Adam had given his own DNA to the same website, <a href="http://Ancestry.co.uk/">Ancestry.co.uk</a> , and they were a “100 per cent match”.</p>
      <p>Nick told the Sunday Mirror: “I paid about £90 for the saliva test and the results came back about 10 days after I had sent the swab back to them.</p>
      <p>“When I saw the results I was thinking, ‘Is this real?’. I felt an overwhelming sense of relief and completion in my life.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how it came about or for what reason Adam put his DNA on the website but I just want to thank him from the bottom of my heart. The website said he did it a few years ago.</p>

      <p>“It has been such a long hard journey, but this has finally given me closure and I have a new found belief in myself from knowing my identity. It’s amazing.”</p>
      <p>Nick, 51, was given up soon after his birth in 1968 and placed in a children’s home in Woolwich, South London.</p>
      <p>His birth name was Aaron Conway, but he was renamed after his adoption and had a middle-class upbringing with three siblings in the Ashdown Forest, East Sussex.</p>
      <p>In 2003 he was reunited with his biological mother Patti Nolder, who had mixed with the stars as a music studio manager and was a guest at Elton John’s 1984 wedding to her best pal Renate Blauel.</p>

      <p>Patti, who now lives in Spain, initially told Nick his father was Chris Andrews, of 1960s rock band Fleur de Lys, but a DNA test ruled this out.</p>
      <p>In 2010, Nick approached Patti’s sister who told him that Maurice was his biological father.</p>
      <p>Maurice died in 2003 aged 53, and Robin died in 2012, aged 62, leaving Barry as the only surviving member of the Bee Gees.</p>
      <p>Two years ago Nick told the Sunday People how he sent three letters to Barry, now 73, begging him to have tests to confirm his ancestry.</p>
      <p>By that time, Nick had taken a facial recognition test that showed it was highly likely he was related to Maurice.</p>
      <p>Maurice’s widow Yvonne – mum to his son Adam and daughter Samantha – indicated she would be happy for a DNA test but later withdrew permission.</p>
      <p>Nick, a professional musician who has been singing since he was six, said: “I just wanted to know the truth and to know my medical history.</p>

      <p>“I was diagnosed with rheumatoid <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/facts-arthritis-how-you-can-6416990">arthritis</a> last month, which Barry Gibb also suffers from and if I had known my family history sooner maybe I could have done something about it.”</p>
      <p>The ancestry test also linked Nick to two other members of Maurice’s wider family, who it says are his cousins.</p>
      <p>Maurice left his widow Yvonne and their ­children a huge estate with six homes around the world and all ownership to copyrights.</p>
      <p>The Bee Gees have sold more than 120 million records like Stayin’ Alive, Night Fever and More Than A Woman.</p>

      <p>But Nick, who lives in Hove, East Sussex, with partner Jacqui, added: “I’ve never been interested in money and as I was legally adopted I would have no claim anyway.</p>
      <p>“I just wanted to know who my dad is. To finally have it in black and white feels unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“I want my story to be a beacon of hope to other adoptees. Never give up, you never know what is going to happen.”</p>
      <p>An agent for the Gibb family was unavailable for comment.</p>
      <p>Patti Nolder has previously refused to talk about the story.</p>
