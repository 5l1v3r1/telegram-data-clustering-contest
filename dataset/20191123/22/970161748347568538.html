      <p>Overstretched doctors who voted to remove home visits from their core work have been told to think again by health secretary Matt Hancock.</p>
      <p>GPs at the Local Medical Commitee conference on Friday backed a proposal to remove home visits from the doctors’ key contract, arguing they no longer had the capacity to offer them.</p>
      <p>But a strongly opposed Mr Hancock said the idea was ‘a complete non-starter’ that would not succeed as negotiations between doctors and health chiefs get underway.</p>
      <p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the health secretary said there was no prospect his position would change adding: ‘The GPs had a vote on what their opening negotiating position should be for the next GP contract.</p>
      <p>‘The idea that people shouldn’t be able, when they need it, to have a home visit from a GP is a complete non-starter and it won’t succeed in their negotiations.</p>

      <p>Asked if these should be carried out by other medical professionals, such as paramedics, Mr Hancock said on some occasions a GP was needed.</p>

      <p>‘Sometimes it should be somebody else, and indeed most home visits are done by nurses and that’s right, but sometimes you need the GP.</p>
      <p>‘And the idea that that would be taken out of the GP contract is, as I say, a complete non-starter.’</p>
      <p>Mr Hancock later repeated on Sky News’s Ridge On Saturday that the idea ‘won’t fly’.</p>
      <p>Kent Local Medical Committee, an independent body that works with the British Medical Association to help shape policy, made the call for the change in GP contracts.</p>
      <p>It argued that ‘GPs no longer have the capacity to offer home visits’ and ‘the anachronism of home visits from core contract work’ should be removed. It also wants a specialist service for urgent visits and that any changes be widely advertised to patients.</p>

      <p>It added that home visits should not be removed entirely and that suitable provision should be properly provided and funded.</p>
      <p>The conference also passed a separate motion to negotiate an acute service for urgent home visits.</p>
      <p>These will form the basis of doctors’ negotiations with NHS England in contract settlements.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: ‘This motion is not intended to remove the ability of GPs to perform home visits. More complex, vulnerable and palliative patients are best served by their GP visiting them when needed.</p>

      <p>‘Currently there is no universal consistency for patients. Increasing demand and falling GP numbers are further compounding pressures in general practice.’</p>
      <p>The body said 26,400,000 general practice appointments took place in September, a rise of 9.7% from the previous year although government figures published on the NHS.uk suggests it is even more at 32,000,000.</p>
      <p>Nikita Kanani, NHS’s national medical director for primary care and a London GP, said patient’s who needed a GP home visit would receive one.</p>
      <p>‘As set out in the NHS Long Term Plan, other healthcare professionals such as nurses and advanced paramedics will also make home visits if a patient needs one.</p>
      <p>‘We recognise the pressures that general practice faces, which is why we are investing an extra £4.5 billion on local doctors and community services which will help fund 20,000 more staff to support GP practices and offer high-quality care for patients.’</p>
