      <p>As part of the effort to keep residents safe, IDF fighters and Shin Bet security agents, Border Guard Police and Israeli Police officers combined forces in an operation to capture 60 wanted terror suspects this weekend.</p>
      <p>The suspects are accused of involvement in terrorist operations, terrorist activities and violence against civilians and Israeli security forces. The detainees were transferred to security personnel for interrogation.</p>
