      <h1>5 things to watch on the ASX 200 next week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:07:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fool.com.au/author/jamesmickleboro/" target="_blank">James Mickleboro</a></address>
      <p>Last week was a busy one for the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index, filled with results, annual general meetings, and banking bombshells.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the negatives appear to have outweighed the positives, leading to the index recording a disappointing 1.2% decline.</p>
      <p>It looks set to be another busy one next week, but hopefully with a better outcome. Here are five things to watch:</p>
      <h3>Afterpay AUSTRAC update.</h3>
      <p><b>Afterpay Touch Group Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Afterpay+Touch+Group+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-APT">(ASX: APT)</a> shares could be on the move on Monday if it releases the results and/or recommendations of its AML/CTF final audit. The interim report was provided to AUSTRAC at the end of September and did not provide any recommendations. They were to be left to the final report which was due to be submitted to AUSTRAC by November 23.</p>
      <h3>SEEK annual general meeting.</h3>
      <p>On Tuesday <b>SEEK Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/SEEK+Limited/?ticker=ASX-SEK">(ASX: SEK)</a> will be holding its annual general meeting in Melbourne. Investors will be keen to see how the job listings company is faring so far in FY 2020. Especially given concerns that its China-based Zhaopin business could be struggling due to the US-China trade war.</p>
      <h3>Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare results.</h3>
      <p>The <b>Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Corp Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Fisher+%26amp%3B+Paykel+Healthcare+Corp+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-FPH">(ASX: FPH)</a> share price will be one to watch next week. It is scheduled to release its full year results on Wednesday. The medical device company recently revealed that it expects full year operating revenue of NZ$1.19 billion and net profit after tax in the range of approximately NZ$255 million to NZ$265 million. All eyes will be on its guidance for FY 2020.</p>
      <h3>Harvey Norman update.</h3>
      <p>Retail giant <b>Harvey Norman Holdings Limited</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Harvey+Norman+Holdings+Limited/?ticker=ASX-HVN">(ASX: HVN)</a> is holding its annual general meeting on Wednesday in Sydney. Traditionally the retailer provides a sales update for the period from July 1 up to the Friday before the meeting. This update should reveal whether the improving housing market has positively impacted its sales.</p>
      <h3>Collins Foods half year result.</h3>
      <p>The <b>Collins Foods Ltd</b> <a href="https://www.fool.com.au/company/Collins+Foods+Ltd/?ticker=ASX-CKF">(ASX: CKF)</a> share price will be on watch on Wednesday when it releases its half year results. The quick service restaurant operatorâ€™s shares have been on fire this year thanks to its strong performance in FY 2019. Investors will be hoping this strong form has carried over into FY 2020 for its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants.</p>
