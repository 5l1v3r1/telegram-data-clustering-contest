      <h1>Woman attempts to break hula hoop Guinness World Record with more than 75 hours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:02:32+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:02</time> by <a rel="author">Gerren Keith Gaynor</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/chicago">Chicago</a> woman may have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/fitness">hula hooped</a> her way to a Guinness World Record. </p>
      <p>Jenny Doan, 29, is believed to have made history Friday after unofficially surpassing the record for the longest marathon hula hooping session.</p>
      <p>Doan, originally from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/regions/australia">Australia</a>, passed the previously held record of 74 hours and 54 minutes but said she’s not stopping until she reaches the 100-hour mark.</p>
      <p>Since starting her marathon on Tuesday morning at a local bar, Doan said she only slept three hours and has managed to push through the pain, <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2019/11/22/new-world-record-hula-hooping-set-jenny-doan-chicago">WTTW</a> reported.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When she was at the 67-hour mark, Doan was in pain due to lactic acid buildup in her legs, which led to knee stiffness.</p>
      <p>“It was a terrible ripple effect,” she said.</p>
      <p>Still, she managed to keep going. During her 5-minute break, which is allowed every hour she completes per official Guinness rules, Doan sat in a chair while supporters rubbed her legs to help with recovery. She also began using knee braces and compression socks.</p>
      <p>Though she’s already surpassed the previously held record, Doan’s reported record will remain unofficial until it’s verified by Guinness.</p>
      <p>Doan isn’t just hula hooping her way to a possible world title. She’s also using the challenge to raise funds for the nonprofit Mental Health America.</p>
      <p>To keep her going, Doan listens to music, streams Netflix and texts her friends -- all while still maintaining her form.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But there may be a discrepancy as to whether Doan broke the 74-hour, 54-minute record. Doan reportedly dropped her hoop around the 58-hour, 24-minute mark, according to the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-life-hula-hoop-world-record-break-jenny-doan-1122-20191122-h2trs47cy5f27gh246bwmhg45u-story.html">Chicago Tribune</a>.</p>
      <p>During the livestream, Doan determined that the drop can be used as one of her 5-minute breaks. But a Guinness World Records spokesperson said, “The individual cannot drop the hula hoop and then proceed to request the use of the 5-minute break.”</p>
      <p>“It’ll be an interesting discussion,” said Doan’s roommate Chris Vellucci. “I’d understand if she didn’t have breaks accrued, then absolutely, it’s a failed attempt. But having break time, that was her break.”</p>
      <p>“She had banked time to take a break,” he added, “which involves dropping the hoop. Sometimes she’d catch it and throw it down [to start her other breaks].”</p>
      <p>To prepare for her big feat, Doan enrolled in a rigorous four-month training program, in which she alternated with different-sized hoops for high speed and endurance.</p>
      <p>Whether she officially achieves her goal remains to be seen. Still, if she does, she anticipates holding the record for a long time to come.</p>

      <p>“Hula hooping is sufficiently obscure,” Doan said. “So if I was to hold [the record], I’d hope to hold it for a while, for the same 10 years, if not longer.”</p>
