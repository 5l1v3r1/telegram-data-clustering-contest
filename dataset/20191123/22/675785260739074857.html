      <h1>Chelsea manager Frank Lampard can become one of the very best like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea might not have won but their contribution to a cracking contest was clear and obvious on Saturday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:20:04+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Bates, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/steve-bates/</a></address>
      <p>As a player Frank Lampard was in the heavyweight division reaching the peaks with his unique skill-set.</p>
      <p>And given another year or so in the Chelsea hot-seat you wouldn't bet against him joining the likes of Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp as a manager from the very top drawer.</p>
      <p>For in the space of just a few short months it's clear Lampard is capable of developing a body of work in management that could be as impressive as the days when he pulled on his boots.</p>
      <p>It's not often Guardiola is tactically out-witted. Neither is it usual to see Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva watching while the opposition pass the ball around them.</p>

      <p>Nor do many teams arrive at The Etihad with a plan of attack that's built on more than blind hope.</p>
      <p>But for spells on Saturday night Chelsea – who staggeringly beat City for possession - were a team posing problems galore for Guardiola and his champions.</p>
      <p>In the end City's quality in attack and a huge slice of luck to gain the vital first-half equaliser by De Bruyne proved decisive for Guardiola's men in their quest to keep Liverpool in the sights.</p>
      <p>City's experience, investment and leadership put them some distance ahead of Chelsea and Lampard right now.</p>
      <p>Yet there's no denying Lampard looks the right man to perhaps break up the Guardiola/Klopp monopoly.</p>

      <p>The return of Jose Mourinho might give Tottenham hope that their man can go toe-to-toe with the Premier League's Big Two.</p>
      <p>But Chelsea's power-brokers should be quietly confident that given the same time in the job as Guardiola and Klopp, Lampard could be an English answer to the overseas managerial domination of the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Chelsea might not have won but their contribution to a cracking contest was clear and obvious.</p>
      <p>And Guardiola looked as edgy and skittish as he's done for a while as Jorginho and Mateo Kovacic formed a midfield axis that gave Chelsea the upper-hand against City's well-oiled machine.</p>
      <p>The Premier League is a brutal place to cut your managerial teeth.</p>

      <p>But for Lampard the return of Mourinho to London could be good news with the inevitable circus following the new Tottenham boss and his every move.</p>
      <p>Even if that dims the spotlight on Lampard in the capital by a tiny margin it will be vital space for the Chelsea boss to continue laying the foundations of his own dynasty at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>For while Mourinho has a reputation as a two-season wonder with the third usually a car crash, Lampard has the look of a man who wants to be at Chelsea's helm for years.</p>
      <p>The last time Chelsea were at The Etihad Maurizio Sarri's team were 4-0 down in 25 minutes and ended up being hammered 6-0.</p>

      <p>Only four of that side started this time but the change in Chelsea under Lampard goes way beyond that.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are easy on the eye in a way Sarri's hurly-burly style never was and the way they kept going and pressing for a point right until the end was a huge plus for Lampard.</p>
      <p>City started brightly knowing they have little margin for error these days after Liverpool's blistering start to the campaign was underlined by another late winner – this time at Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>De Bruyne was a whisker away from giving City the champions the lead with a shot which flashed past the far post after a pass from Sergio Aguero.</p>

      <p>But Chelsea arrived in Manchester high on confidence and self-belief with six straight League wins and went close to scoring through Willian and young defender Fikayo Timori before taking the lead.</p>
      <p>N'Golo Kante ran on to a sumptuous pass from Kovacic before squeezing the ball past Bernard Mendy and Ederson to score as they converged on him after 21 minutes.</p>
      <p>City were level eight minutes later with De Bruyne's shot deflecting past Kepa Arrizabalaga off Kurt Zouma after Jorginho had unusually lost possession.</p>
      <p>Riyad Mahrez grabbed the eventual winner with a clever low finish after 37 minutes but victory never felt safe as Chelsea refused to lie down and VAR ruled out Raheem Sterling's late goal for offside.</p>
