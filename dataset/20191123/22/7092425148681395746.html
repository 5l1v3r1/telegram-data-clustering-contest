        <b>A Dublin bar owner has posted a hilarious job advert for an 'experienced snowflake'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Are you self righteous, over confident and over sensitive? Then maybe it's the role for you!</p>
      <p>Oscars Cafe Bar in Smithfield posted the job advert on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2788126597885827&amp;id=548550188510157"><i>Facebook</i></a>, adding that if it offends you then you have the job already.</p>
      <p>Some of the key points include;</p>
      <p>
        <i>• Extensive experience in using a smartphone required, in fact we expect our candidate to have a smartphone attached to their hand at all times and be able to get through the working day without looking up from phone.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>• Be adept at taking selfies throughout the working day. Ability to disregard one’s own safety or that of colleague in the quest of a perfect “selfie” would be desirable. Additionally, being completely insensitive will help, for example taking selfies at funerals, car accidents and any type of personal tragedy</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>• A thorough knowledge of all current and emerging social media platforms is essential. Your social media “friends” will ideally be like minded individuals who can support your outrage when leaving comments.</i>
