      <h1>Prince Andrew’s Mates Say He’s “Shell-Shocked” At How Badly This Week Has Gone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:48:11+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author">By Alasdair Duncan</a></address>
      <p>Friends of <b>Prince Andrew </b>say that the disgraced royal is “shell-shocked” at how badly his <i><b>BBC Newsnight</b></i> interview was received, and the extent to which public opinion has turned on him.</p>
      <p>The prince gave the interview in an attempt to clear up questions about his friendship with sex offender <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b>, and deny allegations that he had sex with an underage girl.</p>

      <p>He was criticised for his coldness and apparent lack of empathy towards Epstein’s victims, and mocked for a bizarre anecdote he told about a trip to <b>Pizza Express </b>in Woking.</p>
      <p>In the wake of the disastrous interview, Prince Andrew stepped back from his royal duties, and was turfed out of his office at Buckingham Palace with the authorisation of his mother, the queen.</p>
      <p>According to an account from <b><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-whats-next">Vanity Fair</a></b>, the Duke of York believed that the BBC interview would clear the air and allow him to move on. A friend said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Everything is up in the air at the moment. Right now, Andrew is trying to come to terms with what has happened. He genuinely thought he would do the Newsnight interview, clear his name, and be able to move on. He never expected that this would lead to him resigning from royal life. He was shocked that the meeting with the Queen did not go his way. Essentially he was told to step down.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Insiders say it is unlikely that Prince Andrew will be stripped of his royal title, and it is likely that he will continue to stand alongside the family at future public events.</p>
      <p>His daughter <b>Princess Beatrice </b>is set to get married next year, and while the wedding was initially to take place in the U.K., it may now happen in Italy, where her fiancé is from.</p>
