      <h2>Blackburn manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tony-mowbray/"><b>Tony Mowbray</b></a> praised the "natural talent" of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bradley-dack/"><b>Bradley Dack</b></a> after his brace helped his side edge <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/barnsley/"><b>Barnsley</b></a> 3-2.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gerhard-struber/"><b>Gerhard Struber</b></a>'s side displayed character in his first game to come from behind twice, but were undone by defensive frailties and Rovers' top scorer made them pay.</p>
      <p>A terrible pass from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mads-andersen/"><b>Mads Andersen</b></a> led to a simple first goal of the afternoon for Dack in the 24th minute, which was cancelled out by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/conor-chaplin/"><b>Conor Chaplin</b></a>'s second of the term just after the break.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stewart-downing/"><b>Stewart Downing</b></a>'s superb 20-yard drive restored the lead 21 minutes from time, before Barnsley's top scorer Cauley Woodrow forced the ball over the line with just eight minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>But Dack was left free in the area in the 86th minute to scramble home after his initial header was saved.</p>
      <p>After making it back-to-back home wins, Mowbray praised Dack's contribution in what he described as a 'dangerous' game.</p>
      <p>He said: "I love watching Dack when he gets wrapped up in it like he did in the second half, working, running, going playing where the ball is, playing like a kid in the playground really and he's got such natural talent.</p>
      <p>"He scored his goals and helped us win the game. He scored a couple of weeks ago. Bradley is fine. As I said, we basically want him to get wrapped up in the game.</p>
      <p>"It was all about getting three points, I think. That's what we talked about, not about performance levels, but just trying to get three points. I think it was a really dangerous game for us.</p>
      <p>"I've watched Barnsley and I have to say they're a pretty good team. I like the way they play, I think they're full of energy, youthful, play forward.</p>
      <p>"I watched them 2-0 up at half-time against West Brom recently and that's why I say it's a dangerous game because the perception is that they're bottom of the league and you have to beat them, which we do, and we did."</p>
      <p>For Barnsley, there were positives but they have now conceded 36 goals this season â€“ just three fewer than in their promotion-winning campaign last season.</p>
      <p>Struber conceded work needs to be done defensively, but felt his side deserved something from the game.</p>
      <p>He said: "In the second half we created a very good game and one point was the minimum we deserved.</p>
      <p>"We have a long to-do list and especially when we build up, we had a better position, and these were not magic moments, but we planned and we build up and have more control.</p>
      <p>"Then when we lose the ball we have a better situation from pressing and this is the most important thing now.</p>
      <p>"On the other side, we need to clear when the opponent had set pieces. This is a task for every player, and we lost the game because of that. It's a very disappointing result."</p>
      <p>Asked whether the Tykes can stay up, Struber added: "Yes, absolutely. The situation is difficult, yes, I am not a dreamer.</p>
      <p>"But I know when we can create in the next time, better positioning, better control on the ball, I think that we will have good chances to win games and this is our task, and I trust my team will get better next time."</p>
