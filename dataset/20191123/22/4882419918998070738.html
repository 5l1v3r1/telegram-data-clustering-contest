      <p>Gerard Pique spoke to the media after Saturday's win against Leganes, explaining why his involvement with the organisation of the Davis Cup and his job as a Barcelona defender are compatible.</p>
      <p>"I spoke with the coach (Ernesto Valverde), it was a friendly chat," Pique said about his trips to Madrid this week to watch tennis' premier team event, which his company Kosmos have organised.</p>
      <p>"He asked what my plans were for the week and how we were going to do it. I have a phenomenal relationship with the coach. We speak every week or so.</p>
      <p>"The relationship with the club is good, too, the noise comes from outside. The journeys are a 40-minute flight, it's like going to Tarragona by car. Is that tiring? I don't think so."</p>
      <p>"(The debate) has gone a little bit too far but it's part of the circus, I know that. We know how it goes. But I do my job. I come here, I play football. Later I do my own things.</p>
      <p>"I think a lot is made of it because of who I am and what I represent. I try to make things as easy as possible. There are media (outlets) that criticse you one day when you accuse them of being related to the club. Then you give them an interview and the other media (outlets) kills you. I</p>
      <p>"People can think what they want. I respect that and I hope they respect me. People can think what I am doing is not for the best. I know what affects me and what doesn't.</p>
      <p>"I know that the day Barca lose, I am going to take the brunt of the criticism but I've arrived at a point of my life that even when there's a lot of noise I try to do the best possible. That's it."</p>
