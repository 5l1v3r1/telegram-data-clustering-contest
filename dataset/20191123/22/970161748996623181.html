      <p>Khloe Kardashian is said to be ‘worried’ about her ex-boyfriend French Montana after he was recently admitted to hospital.</p>
      <p>The rapper – real name Karim Kharbouch – was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/french-montana-rushed-hospital-suffering-cardiac-issues-severe-nausea-11199095/">rushed to hospital on Thursday</a> after suffering from ‘cardiac issues’, and now Khloe is said to have been ‘concerned’ about him.</p>
      <p>‘Khloe has been in touch with French. She heard the news and was concerned about him,’ a source shared to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1096346/khloe-kardashian-is-worried-but-in-touch-with-ex-french-montana-amid-hospitalization?query=khloe%20kardashian">E! News.</a> ‘She is still worried about him and hoping he gets some good news and they figure out what’s going on.’</p>
      <p>It was previously reported police officers had been called to French’s Calabasas house at 1:30pm on Thursday after reportedly receiving a call of a robbery taking place there.</p>
      <p>Officers who arrived had noticed the 35-year-old was acting out of character when they arrived, and he was said to have been suffering from stomach pain, nausea and an elevated heart rate, which needed urgent medical attention.</p>

      <p>French was taken to a nearby hospital, with <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/french-montana-hospitalized-heart-rate-elevated-stomach-pain/">TMZ</a> reporting that he was ‘awake and alert’ and receiving treatment including IV fluids.</p>
      <p>Police have since suspected that the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/23/french-montana-intoxicated-according-to-police-as-he-was-rushed-to-hospital-despite-denial-11207029/">rapper was ‘intoxicated’</a> as he was rushed to the hospital, although sources close to him have strongly denied his.</p>
      <p>Khloe had previously dated French in 2014 following her split from Lamar Oden, and French has insisted that the two had a ‘dope relationship’ and are still friends to this day.</p>

      <p>‘I feel like we had a real dope relationship – there was no bad blood, nobody did something to somebody that we couldn’t come back from,’ he told <a href="https://hauteliving.com/2019/08/french-montana-haute-living-cover-story/673099/">Haute Living.</a></p>
      <p>‘The love was real. When the love was like that, it’s always going to be like that. Friendship after a friendship is something that’s really hard to do, and I’m glad we’ve been able to do it.’</p>
