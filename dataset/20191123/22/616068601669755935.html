      <p>The Kelowna Rockets returned home from a brief two-game swing through Washington State with two more marks in the win column.</p>
      <p>Leif Mattson provided all the offence the Rockets would need Saturday in a 2-1 victory over Tri-City.</p>
      <p>Things happened fast and furiously. In fact, fans who showed up a few ticks late missed most of the offence these two teams produced.</p>
      <p>The action started after Tri-City was handed a penalty just 83 seconds in.</p>
      <p>Just 15 seconds after the call, Krystof Hrabik beat Roman Basran with a shorthanded goal, putting the home side up a goal.</p>
      <p>Mattson tied it moments later on the same power play. He jumped out of the way of a point shot, turned and banged at the loose puck.</p>
      <p>It eventually went off a Tri-City defender and goaltender Beck Warm and into the net.</p>
      <p>The game stayed that way until the the early seconds of the third.</p>
      <p>With the Rockets shorthanded to start the third, Mattson poked the puck away from a Tri-City player at center.</p>
      <p>Mattson broke in all alone and beat Warm with a wrist shot from in close.</p>
      <p>Basran shut the door the rest of the way, handing the Rockets their fourth win in a row.</p>
      <p>The veteran netminder turned away 24 shots as the Rockets outshot Try-City 29-25.</p>
      <p>The Rockets will host Edmonton Tuesday and Prince George Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Cougars did the Rockets and the rest of the BC Division a big favour, taking two from Kamloops on the weekend.</p>
      <p>Those two defeat, coupled with the Rockets two victories moves Kelowna to within two points of the division-leading Blazers.</p>
