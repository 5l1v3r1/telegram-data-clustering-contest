          <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/22/elon-musk-net-worth-tesla-cybertruck">Musk’s net worth plunged $768m after window fiasco went viral</a>

      <p>Tesla chief executive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> said on Saturday there had been about 150,000 orders for the electric carmaker’s cybertruck, which was unveiled in Los Angeles on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“146k cybertruck orders so far, with 42% choosing dual, 41% tri &amp; 17% single motor,” Musk said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280">tweet</a>, adding that the orders were achieved without any advertising or paid endorsements.</p>
      <p>The launch of the cybertruck, which Musk has described as “a really futuristic-like cyberpunk, Blade Runner pickup”, suffered a very public setback when its “armored glass” windows shattered in a much-anticipated unveiling.</p>
      <p>The overall look of the futuristic electric vehicle worried Wall Street. On Friday, Tesla’s share price plummeted 6%, bringing Musk’s still immense <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hayleycuccinello/2019/11/22/elon-musk-net-worth-cybertruck/#6dbc440e73aa">personal net worth down by $768m</a> in a single day, according to Forbes.</p>
      <p>After the disastrous launch, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198090787520598016">tweeted</a> a video of a successful test of the windows.</p>
      <p>“Franz throws steel ball at cybertruck window right before launch,” he wrote, referring to the design chief, Franz von Holzhausen, who threw the balls that broke both windows in public.</p>
      <p>“Oh my fucking God,” Musk said then. “Maybe that was a little hard.”</p>
      <p>In his tweet after the launch, Musk added: “Guess we have some improvements to make before production haha.”</p>
      <p>Placing an order costs $100, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla">Tesla</a> says is fully refundable. Musk said 17% of the orders were for the single-motor model, 42% were for the dual-motor version and 41% were for the tri-motor model.</p>
      <p>The company has said the cybertruck will be in production in 2021, starting at $39,900, or £30,700.</p>
