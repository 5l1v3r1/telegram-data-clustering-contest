      <h1>Justin Fields Posts Message After Win vs. Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:58:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State’s undefeated season rolled on this weekend with a huge win over Penn State.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes defense dominated for much of the day and escaped a late Nittany Lions comeback attempt to walk out with a 28-17 win. With the win, Ohio State clinches the Big Ten East and a spot in the Big Ten title game.</p>
      <p>Despite the win, there was a worrisome moment in the final minutes of the fourth quarter. Star quarterback Justin Fields was tackled awkwardly and appeared to be hurt on the play.</p>
      <p>However, he bounced right back up and hobbled off the field. After the game, head coach Ryan Day said Fields is “good” and shouldn’t miss any time with an injury.</p>
      <p>A few hours after the game ended, Fields sent a message for the Ohio State faithful.</p>
      <p>“Love this team and Buckeye Nation. Gotta keep getting better each and everyday! #GoBucks,” Fields said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Fields didn’t have his best performance on Saturday, but still finished the game with over 250 yards of offense and two touchdown passes.</p>
      <p>Ohio State improves to 11-0 with the win and sets up a huge game with Michigan next weekend. Can the Wolverines pull off the upset in Ann Arbor?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
