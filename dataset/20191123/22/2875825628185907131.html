      <h1>Man Utd suffer transfer blow in January pursuit of Erling Haaland</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had made the 19-year-old Norway striker his top target for the January transfer window.</h2>

      <p>Manchester United will miss out on Erling Braut Haaland – because Red Bull Leipzig have first refusal.</p>
      <p>Old Trafford boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had made the 19-year-old Norway striker his top target for the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>But his chances of landing Red Bull Salzburg’s prodigious marksman have been dashed because of a contractual tie-up between the two branded clubs – and a £25.7m release clause.</p>
      <p>Haaland, son of former Leeds legend Alf-Inge, has already bagged 26 goals this season. But reports in Germany in the last 48 hours have suggested that Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig are also interested in the teenager.</p>

      <p>It means they will have first refusal because the buy-out in his current deal with the Austrians relates ONLY to their sister club across the border.</p>
      <p>Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche spoke in glowing terms last week about Haaland.</p>
      <p>And his father Alf-Inge has also suggested a spell in the Bundesliga should be his first port of call before he jumps into the Premier League.</p>

      <p>It means that <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> will miss out – unless Leipzig buy Haaland and then sell him on immediately for a handsome profit. Salzburg were holding out for a £75m payment, but that looks remote if Leipzig trigger the clause.</p>
      <p>The transfer fee is a huge hike on the fee that the Red Devils could have paid when their attention was first drawn to him.</p>
      <p>Haaland was just 16 years of age when he started making waves at his first club, Bryne.</p>

      <p>He was offered around for a staggering £90,000 – but no one took the club up on their offer. <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> did take a look at Haaland, but he was rejected on the grounds that he was ‘too wooden’ by the then recruitment team.</p>
      <p>Even after Haaland left his first club for Molde, he was available for a cut-price £3m plus appearance-related add-ons.</p>
      <p>But no one, apart from Salzburg were prepared to take the gamble. Their punt on the youngster is now being rewarded with a potentially-huge profit.</p>
