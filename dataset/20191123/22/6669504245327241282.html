      <p>SURREY, B.C. - Homicide detectives say they're investigating after two people were found dead inside a home in Surrey, B.C.</p>
      <p>RCMP officers discovered the bodies when they arrived at the home Thursday evening, then called the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team to lead the probe.</p>
      <p>Const. Harrison Mohr with the investigation team says early evidence suggests one of the dead was the victim of a homicide.</p>
      <p>He says the two people knew one another and police are not looking for any outstanding suspects.</p>
      <p>The RCMP did not release the names of the dead.</p>
