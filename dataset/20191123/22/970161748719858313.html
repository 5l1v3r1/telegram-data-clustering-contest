      <p>A teenager who was among the 39 migrants whose bodies were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex, had gone missing from an asylum centre in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The country’s Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (COA) told local media the youngster had run away from a shelter for vulnerable migrants.</p>
      <p>The agency refused to give details about the name or age of the teenager.</p>
      <p>Ten teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among the 39 Vietnamese nationals found in the trailer in an industrial park in Grays, Essex, in the early hours of October 23, shortly after the lorry arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
      <p>It comes after the names of all 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found in the lorry were released by police.</p>
      <p>Five people have been arrested in connection with the deaths.</p>
      <p>The driver, Mo Robinson, 25, from Northern Ireland, has appeared in court charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering, and is expected to appear at the Old Bailey on Monday.</p>
