      <h1>Glastonbury 2020: Rumours Taylor Swift will be next confirmed headliner</h1>
      <h2>Rumours have been circulating for weeks she will be playing Worthy Farm next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:00:38+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Flanagan</a></address>
      <p>Speculation pop star Taylor Swift will be taking to the Pyramid Stage at next year's <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/glastonbury-festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> have been circulating for weeks.</p>
      <p>But they have ramped up a notch this week as Michael Eavis confirms one of next year's headliners is a woman 'everybody loves'.</p>
      <p>As one of the biggest-selling artists of the decade, with more than 50-million records sold, and the first female artist to win a Grammy for album of the year twice, certainly fits that bill.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07t4snh">BBC Somerset</a>, Eavis said: one of the two remaining headliners is a woman, adding: “You would love her to bits – everybody does – but no names at the moment.”</p>

      <p>Since that interview bookies have slashed the odds on the <i>Lover</i> singer-song writer with SkyBet now offering just 3/1 odds.</p>
      <p>Swift, who will be touring Europe next June and has a significant weekend free in her schedule, fuelled the rumours even more <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/taylor-swift-glastonbury-2020-headliner-3467484">when she referred to herself as a "headliner"</a> on her social media.</p>
      <p>Although referring to her famously passionate fans, she could also have been hinting at the possibility that she'll be appearing as one of the festival's three headliners.</p>
      <p>And Taylor Swift may even take the opportunity to visit Bristol, if the Glastonbury rumours are true, after loosely referencing the city in a song on her latest album. London Boy refers to her boyfriend's "stories from uni". Actor Joe Alwyn, who has been dating the singer since 216, attend University of Bristol.</p>
