      <h1>Flamengo win Copa Libertadores with amazing comeback against River Plate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:15:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/23/Agencies" target="_blank">Agencies</a></address>

        <i>• Flamengo 2-1 River Plate <br/>• Gabriel Barbosa scores twice in final minutes then sent off</i>
      </p>
      <p>Flamengo won the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa-libertadores">Copa Libertadores</a> for the first time in 38 years with two goals from Gabriel Barbosa in the last three minutes, beating the defending champions, River Plate, 2-1 after an astonishing comeback in Lima.</p>
      <p>River took the lead through Rafael Borré after 14 minutes and looked to be cruising to their fifth Libertadores triumph.</p>
      <p>However, Barbosa, the striker nicknamed Gabigol who is on loan from Internazionale, tapped in from close range with a minute left and then rifled home from 15 metres in injury time to secure victory.</p>
      <p>Barbosa was sent off in the dying moments, along with Exequiel Palacios of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/riverplate">River Plate</a>, in a chaotic finish. The result gave Flamengo only their second Copa Libertadores and means they will represent South America in the Club World Cup in Qatar in December. The first single-match final of the Copa was moved from Santiago to the Peruvian capital because of street protests in Chile.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/flamengo">Flamengo</a> will win the Brazilian championship on Sunday if second-placed Palmeiras fail to beat Gremio.</p>
      <p>They came into the final on the back of a 26-game unbeaten run but appeared overawed. River Plate seldom looked like losing their lead as they outplayed and outmuscled Flamengo before their unlikely late comeback.</p>
