      <h1>Dolly Boost For European Chase</h1>

      <p>With Montpellier chasing a European place this season, they received a welcome boost this week as Bafana Bafana’s Keagan Dolly returned to full training.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Read: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/players-abroad/bafana-s-lebo-mothiba-showed-his-soft-side-at-the-weekend/667283">Heartwarming Scenes As Mothiba Gives Fan Special Gift</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>Dolly has had a tough year in 2019 after working so hard to get back from a serious injury earlier in the year, but after breaking back into the team following his recovery in France, the attacker picked up an injury while on international duty with Bafana Bafana that saw him spend another spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Now though, having got himself back from the injury sustained against Mali, Dolly was back in full training with Montpellier this week, and – though this weekend’s game comes too soon for him – he’ll be eager to try and get back into Michel Der Zakarian’s matchday squad before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>The news will also come as a boost for Bafana head coach, Molefi Ntseki, as he starts to plan for South Africa’s 2022 World Cup qualifiers in March of next year, and he’ll be hoping for Dolly to start getting games under his belt as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Dolly’s side face Bongani Zungu’s Amiens next weekend in front of their home crowd, and the former Mamelodi Sundowns man would no doubt love the chance to face his former club colleague in Ligue 1 if given the chance.</p>
