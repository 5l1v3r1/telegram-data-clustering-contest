      <h1>Galaxy S11e renders point to three cameras and no headphone jack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:06:21+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>Samsung added a third tier to the Galaxy S lineup last year, with the introduction of the S10e. The phone combined most of the features from the S10 and S10+ with a smaller body, much to the appreciation of small phone fans everywhere. The first renders of the regular Galaxy S11 were <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/22/samsung-galaxy-s11-onleaks-renders-specs/">published yesterday</a>, and now we're getting a look at the S11e.</p>
      <p>The S11e appears to follow the same basic formula as the last version: most of the features of the regular S devices in a smaller form factor. The screen measures between 6.2-6.3 inches, which is smaller than the S11's 6.7-6.9" display, but slightly larger than the 5.8" S10e. The entire case is 151.7 x 69.1mm x 7.9mm (or 9.1mm including the camera bump). That makes the phone just as wide as the S10e, with the same depth, but the screen increases the height.</p>

      <p>The camera array appears to have a few features removed, compared to yesterday's S11 renders. There are three sensors, plus an LED flash, but OnLeaks/PriceBaba was unable to determine what exactly the setup is. Three sensors is at least an upgrade from the S10e, which only has a regular 12MP lens and a 16MP ultra-wide shooter.</p>

      <p>Fans of the S10e's super-fast physical fingerprint sensor might be disappointed, as the S11e seems to have an in-screen sensor, just like the Note10. Also like the Note10, there is no headphone jack, with only a Type-C port on the bottom of the phone.</p>
      <p>We'll likely see more of this phone (and the rest of the S11 lineup) a lot more over the coming months. If previous Galaxy phone launches are any indication, Samsung is a leaky ship.</p>
