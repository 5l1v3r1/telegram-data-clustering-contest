      <p>Both judge <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/louis-walsh">Louis Walsh</a> and viewers at home were left furious after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> bent the rules for singing duo Max and Harvey during <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">Celebrity: X Factor</a> 's Movie Week tonight.</p>
      <p>The music mogul, 60, allowed Max and Harvey to perform popular One Direction track 'Kiss You' from their movie 'This Is Us'.</p>
      <p>After the twins' energetic performance, Louis, 67, slammed Simon for 'bending the rules' and allowing them to sing a song that questions the definition of what qualifies as an approved track for Movie Week.</p>

      <p>After Nicole revealed she was on the Max and Harvey train, Louis said: "Every week you deliver and you actually remind me of One Direction the first time they sang.</p>
      <p>"It is the energy, the positivity, and I love the fact you sang one of their more unusual songs. You are ready made..."</p>
      <p>The Irish judge then questioned Simon: "The theme is movies. What movie is this song from Simon?"</p>

      <p>Simon rolled his eyes, before sarcastically shutting down Louis' suspicions.</p>
      <p>He argued: "It is called the One Direction movie, which was one of the biggest music movies of all time Louis.</p>
      <p>"You were probably in bed when the movie came out."</p>
      <p>The judge then complimented Max and Harvey and said they brought "real energy" and said it was totally "age appropriate."</p>

      <p>Some viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to agree with Louis and question the song choice.</p>
      <p>One user swiped: "I'm sorry the 1D movie doesn't count!!!</p>
      <p>"Really Simon? Have Max and Harvey sing a song from an iconic Hollywood movie?"</p>
      <p>While another insisted: "Simon is changing the rules constantly."</p>
      <p>One viewer questioned: "One direction has a movie?"</p>
      <p>Whereas a One Direction fan took to Twitter to correct Simon.</p>
      <p>They shared:" The fact Simon said the movie was called One direction the movie.</p>
      <p>"NO IT WAS CALLED ONE DIRECTION THIS IS US THE MOVIE! Get it right."</p>
