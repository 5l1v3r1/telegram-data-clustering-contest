      <h1>Iggy Azalea &amp; Playboi Carti’s Home Robbed While She Was Home Alone</h1>

      <p>A burglar hit <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/iggy-azalea-answers-t-i-after-he-attacks-her-in-this-viral-video-336517/">Iggy Azalea</a> and Playboi Carti’s 6,500-square foot rental mansion in the exclusive Atlanta suburb of Buckhead last weekend, and they successfully got away with approximately $366,000 in jewelry, according to a new report. Azalea – AKA Amethyst Kelly – was home alone on Sunday night, November 14th, when the thief showed up. However, she did not report the robbery until three days later.</p>
      <p>The <i>Atlanta Journal Constitution</i> reports that the burglar stole 19 pieces of jewelry, including diamond rings, luxury watches, and platinum bracelets. In the incident report, Azalea says she unlocked a door for Carti at around 9:50 p.m. because it was raining outside, and she believes that’s how the burglar got into the home.</p>

      <p>The Australian rapper says she was on the first floor of the house when she heard footsteps on the second floor, but she thought it was Playboi Carti, AKA Jordan Carter. The couple eventually noticed that a designer bag that they keep their jewelry in was missing from the second floor dining room.</p>
      <p>Luckily, the home does have outdoor security cameras, and Azalea gave police surveillance footage of the suspect walking into the house. The video, which has not yet been released to the public, shows a man wearing gloves and a dark mask – and also carrying a gun – walking into the home through an unlocked door in the back.</p>

      <p>The thief broke in around the same time that Azalea says she unlocked the door, and he was in and out of the home in under ten minutes. When the burglar left the residence, he was carrying a bag in his hand.</p>
      <p>The home does not have security cameras inside, so the outdoor footage is the only video the police have to work with.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Azalea is a Grammy nominee known for her 2014 smash hit <i>Fancy</i> and her collab with Ariana Grande on the hit <i>Problem, </i>and she has reportedly been dating Playboi Carti for about a year. The 23-year-old rapper’s most recent album was 2018’s <i>Die Lit</i>, and his new album <i>Whole Lotta Red</i> is expected to be released later this year.</p>
