      <p>The luxury items of all of this year's I'm A Celebrity contestants have been now been handed out with quite a few surprises.</p>
      <p>So far there is one luxury that has had everyone talking - Adele's picture of Jane McDonald - which prompted the biggest spat of the new series so far.</p>
      <p>Well now her fellow jungle campmates have got their hands on their luxury items too.</p>
      <p>Camp Leader James and his deputy Jacqueline entered camp bearing gifts - or at least the remaining luxury items that had yet to be won. </p>
      <p>He and Jacqueline handed them out to the delighted <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> stars who sat around the camp stove.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn was first saying that she couldn't sleep with a dry face explaining her choice of luxury face cream.</p>
      <p>Roman had a mug with a picture of his girlfriend and dog on it.  Nadine had a tangle teaser for her hair. Cliff was given his oddly shaped present and he said "This is something I think we might all enjoy a little bit" as he unwrapped a Christmas tree to cheers from the other campmates.</p>
      <p>Ian explained that his luxury item "wasn't physical".  Music started to play in the Jungle clearing and Ian explained that his luxury item was his favourite track - Kirk Franklin’s Looking For You, which he could have played three times.  All the campmates danced around the camp stove with joy at hearing music for the first time for ten days.</p>
      <p>Andy chose lip balm, Myles had a disposable camera, Andrew had an inflatable chair, Jacqueline had a pillow with family photos on and James had a memory foam neck support pillow.</p>
