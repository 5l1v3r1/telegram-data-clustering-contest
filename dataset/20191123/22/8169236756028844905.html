        <b>It will be interesting to see how long the Real Madrid fans decide to stay in the huff with Gareth Bale. Yes he did celebrate Wales qualifying with a flag that read “Wales-golf-Madrid – in that order” on it, but it was clearly a bit of fun.</b>

      <p>If there’s any club in the world that loves drama then it’s Real Madrid. He might not even have to win the fans over, it could just be a case of waiting for someone else to do something wrong and letting them take the abuse instead.</p>
