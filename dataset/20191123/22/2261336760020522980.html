      <h1>Betting odds: Pacquiao favored as Mayweather’s next opponent, Dana White &amp; GSP are options</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Mercado</a></address>
      <p>With undefeated boxing great Floyd Mayweather recently announcing that he will be <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/22/20977325/floyd-mayweather-says-hes-coming-out-of-retirement-working-with-dana-white-on-spectacular-event">coming out of retirement</a> in the year 2020, casual and hardcore fans alike are wondering which sport, or promotion, he will be competing in—and of course who his next opponent will be. Bloody Elbow is here to bring you some betting lines that might answer these questions, courtesy of <a href="https://www.sportsbetting.ag/sportsbook/futures-and-props/boxing-props">SportsBetting.ag</a>.</p>
      <p>First off, let’s cover which sport or promotion are on the table as possible options for Mayweather’s return. The sweet scientist has already cleaned out his own sport (and Conor McGregor) and has also competed in a ‘boxing-only’ exhibition against Japanese kickboxing standout Tenshin Nasukawa, for the RIZIN FF league. In short, Floyd does what Floyd wants, but here are some betting lines for where he might land next.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boxing +200</li>
        <li>UFC +300</li>
        <li>RIZIN +5000</li>
        <li>Bare Knuckle FC +10000</li>
        <li>ONE Championship +10000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With a moneyline of +200, boxing is the sport favored to be his next move, which makes perfect sense because it’s the only sport in which Mayweather has competed in professionally. The UFC is next in line at +300, which is understandable since Mayweather announced his return to combat sports after chumming it up with Dana White at a recent L.A. Clippers vs Boston Celtics basketball game.</p>
      <p>White has been named as the man that Mayweather will be working with to ‘bring the world another spectacular event.’ And if that’s the case, then history would say that any other promotion is out of the realm of possibilities. Thus, RIZIN FF is a major underdog option at +5000, the increasingly popular Bare Knuckle FC league is a long shot at +10000, and one of the UFC’s biggest competitors, ONE Championship, can be wagered on at +10000.</p>
      <p>Whether boxing or MMA, online betting site <a href="https://www.sportsbetting.ag/sportsbook/futures-and-props/boxing-props">SportsBetting.ag</a> has listed six names as potential opponents for the undefeated superstar.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manny Pacquiao +200</li>
        <li>Georges St-Pierre +400</li>
        <li>Khabib Nurmagomedov +450</li>
        <li>Canelo Alvarez +1000</li>
        <li>Conor McGregor +1000</li>
        <li>Dana White +10000</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Considering how many numbers their first bout generated, Manny Pacquiao has been deemed most likely to square off with Mayweather next. The aging boxing legend can be acquired at a value of +200. After that, former UFC welterweight and middleweight champ, Georges St-Pierre, is listed as a +400 option. The UFC’s current lightweight king, Khabib Nurmagomedov, is right behind him with a dog tag of +450. Bettors can take the price on rematches with Canelo Alvarez and Conor McGregor, independently, at a cost of +1000 each. The most farfetched, yet possibly the most enticing, choice listed for Floyd’s next outing is against UFC president Dana White. Despite how crazy the idea seems, gamblers can act on this wager that owns an astounding underdog line of +10000. Hey, it could happen?</p>
