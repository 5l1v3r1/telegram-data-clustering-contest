      <p>TOTTENHAM’S DELE ALLI has refuted suggestions his form has dipped this season after he played a starring role in Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United boss Mourinho marked his first game at the helm since replacing Mauricio Pochettino this week with a 3-2 win over West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Alli was in impressive form against Manuel Pellegrini’s side, teeing up Son Heung-min for Spurs’ first and then showing superb footwork to help create Lucas Moura’s second.</p>
      <p>Widely criticised for his performances so far this season, Alli was not included in Gareth Southgate’s most recent England squad.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was in bullish form after the win at the London Stadium, though, insisting there has been nothing below-par about his displays this campaign.</p>
      <p>“I think I have been performing well so far this season, despite the results,” he told BT Sport.</p>
      <blockquote>Individually I haven’t been playing that badly. A lot of people ask if I am going to find my old form. I don’t want to find my old form; I want to get better than that, improve and use my full potential.”</blockquote>
      <p>While conceding it has been an emotional week for Tottenham’s players, Alli said there was never any doubt they would be fully focused on Saturday’s game.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a very tough week for us, emotionally,” he added. “Obviously, we spent a long time with Poch and we were all shocked when we heard the news. But we know we have a job to do and got out and perform for the fans.</p>

      <p>“No matter what happens we have to stay together as a squad. That’s football; things change. We make sure we get the three points and try and stay as positive as we can.”</p>
