        <b>Eire Og (Carlow) 2-11 Portlaoise (Laois) 1-6</b>
      </p>
      <p>Carlow, it seems, has another rising on its hands with both of its senior club champions through to the AIB Leinster finals.</p>
      <p>St Mullins took care of business on the hurling front last weekend and the county’s three-in-a-row football champions Eire Og, also facing Laois opposition in the semi-finals, progressed with surprising ease.</p>
      <p>They walked into the lion’s den at ’Moore Park to face hosts and joint record provincial title holders Portlaoise yet surged to a memorable win.</p>
      <p>It was all a bit of a blast from the past with Eire Og, champions of Leinster five times in the 1990s, playing with a swagger again and burning off Portlaoise with a sublime second-half display.</p>
      <p>They outscored Niall Rigney’s men by 1-6 to 0-1 over that half hour or so, holding the favourites scoreless from play.</p>
      <p>So while <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Chris+Blake">Chris Blake</a> took the plaudits for his excellent return of 1-4 - 1-3 of which came from play - it was a victory built on a platform of stout defending.</p>
      <p>A number of sons of 1990s players were in action for Eire Og including Niall Quinlan, the offspring of club and county legend Willie Quinlan, and his three second-half points, all from frees, were significant.</p>
      <p>Like St Mullins, few will give Eire Og a chance of making off with the silverware on December 8th though after taking out the Wexford, Kildare and now Laois champions, they’ll feel anything is possible.</p>
      <p>They dominated Portlaoise for three quarters of their semi-final, bursting into a 1-3 to 0-1 lead after the first quarter and only really struggling for a 15-minute period in the run up to half-time when Rigney’s hosts raised a brief gallop.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kieran+Lillis">Kieran Lillis</a> hit an 18th minute goal for Portlaoise though his evening would end in frustration following a 53rd minute red card for a second yellow.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Conor+Boyle">Conor Boyle</a> also walked for Portlaoise in stoppage time for a red card though the game was well up by that stage.</p>
      <p>With Blake on song for Eire Og, they picked off the scores throughout the second-half and Ross Dunphy put the tin hat on a cracking performance by the underdogs with their second goal on the hour.</p>
      <p>Like Blake’s earlier goal in the opening minute, it was a high quality move that Dunphy began and finished, eventually booting in from close range after a ball across from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Derek+Hayden">Derek Hayden</a>.</p>
      <p>Blake admitted afterwards they were inspired partly by their famous fathers and partly by the progress of St Mullins.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit of a dream to be honest, to get through,” said Blake. “No doubt we’ll be underdogs but I can guarantee we’ll go out and give it 100 per cent.”</p>
