      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Cliff brings in Christmas tree as luxury item</h1>

      <p>The rest of the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> campmates received their luxury items on Saturday – and it’s safe to say that Cliff Parisi’s item was the best ever.</p>
      <p>The Call The Midwife actor decided to bring a bit of festive cheer to the jungle in the form of a Christmas tree (and I didn’t think we could love him anymore).</p>
      <p>Camp Leader <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-haskell/">James Haskell</a> and his deputy <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> entered the camp bearing gifts – or at least the remaining luxury items that had yet to be won.</p>
      <p>He and Jacqueline handed them out to the delighted celebrities who sat around the camp stove.</p>
      <p>Cliff was given his oddly shaped present and he said ‘This is something I think we might all enjoy a little bit’ as he unwrapped a Christmas tree to cheers from the other campmates.</p>
      <p>As Caitlyn Jenner was handed her she exclaimed how she couldn’t sleep with a dry face explaining her choice of luxury face cream.</p>

      <p>Ian explained that his luxury item ‘wasn’t physical’</p>
      <p>Music started to play in the Jungle clearing and Ian explained that his luxury item was his favourite track – Kirk Franklin’s Looking For You, which he could have played three times.</p>
      <p>All the campmates danced around the camp stove with joy at hearing music for the first time for ten days.</p>
      <p>Andy chose lip balm, Myles had a disposable camera, Andrew had an inflatable chair, Jacqueline had a pillow with family photos on and James had a memory foam neck support pillow.</p>
      <p>Fans swiftly took to Twitter to share their love towards Minty.</p>

      <p>The news follows after Adele Roberts baffled both viewers and her fellow celebs after bringing in a picture of Jane McDonald as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>Although<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/"> Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness soon set the record straight after taking to social media</a> to reveal why her partner decided to take in her beloved photo of the cruise-ship singer.</p>
      <p>And it turns out, Adele loves ‘a bit of Jane’ to cheer her (and her Radio 1 listeners) up if they’re having a bad day.</p>

      <p>‘I can clear this up. All the campmates have to have different luxury items, they’re not allowed to double up on anything,’ Kate began.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘So Adele’s first choice of a family photo was already taken which she didn’t mind because she knew there’d be campmates who’d love a pic of their children in there with them.</p>
      <p>‘Second choice, a pillow, was another goner as it’s usually the most requested item. Pretty much everything she wanted after that was already taken too.’</p>
