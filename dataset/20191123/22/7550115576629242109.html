      <p>It means that Flamengo will be joining Liverpool at the FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar next month, with the two sides favourites to progress and meet in the final.</p>
      <p>Argentine side River had been leading from the 14th minute to the 89th minute, but late goals from Gabriel Barbosa flipped the tie on its head.</p>
      <p>The two goals of ‘Gabi Goal’ – who is on loan from Inter Milan – took his tally 40 goals for the season.</p>
      <p>In a frenetic finish to the match, Barbosa was then dismissed in stoppage time along with Palacios of River.</p>
      <p>The win was Flamengo’s first Copa Libertadores title since 1981 – when they went on to beat Liverpool 3-0 in the Club World Cup final in Toyko.</p>
      <p>Liverpool will be seeking their first Club World Cup success, and avenging that defeat would be the perfect way to do so.</p>
