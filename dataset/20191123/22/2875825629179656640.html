      <h1>Anthony Joshua responds to suggestion he will follow Tyson Fury into WWE</h1>
      <h2>Tyson Fury made a reported £12million from his pro wrestling debut against WWE star Braun Strowman in Saudi Arabia last month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Joshua has scoffed at suggestions he might one day follow <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> into the wrestling ring.</p>
      <p>Former world heavyweight champion Fury made a reported £12million from his pro wrestling debut against WWE star Braun Strowman in Saudi Arabia last month.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> , the man who holds the WBC world heavyweight strap, claimed last week that he would be open to a wrestling contest, too.</p>
      <p>But Joshua, who will face Andy Ruiz Junior in Saudi on Saturday week in a bid to win back the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO belts both he and Fury have held, doesn’t want to diminish the hard-earned reputation he has carved out in boxing for the sake of appearing in a “pantomime”.</p>

      <p>Asked if he would ever consider it, he said: “No. We were talking about it. When you go to Saudi, we go to Saudi for our respective crafts.</p>
      <p>“Other people go to Saudi for a pantomime.</p>
      <p>“I’m dedicated to the craft and people know that. They know they can’t call me up to come and do wrestling.</p>
      <p>“They call me up to do boxing and that’s all I want, my respect in boxing. It’s hard to get respect in boxing, especially as a UK fighter.</p>
      <p>“We don’t get the respect we deserve.”</p>

      <p>Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn knows exactly what response he would get if he called to propose a WWE dust-up.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’d love to put that phone call to him. The answer would be so quick, ‘**** off’.”</p>
      <p>Speaking last week, Wilder said: “We thought about wrestling years ago for marketing purposes, promotion and that stuff.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got the character to be able to perform in that environment, it would be something fun.</p>
      <p>“And I wouldn’t turn it down.”</p>
