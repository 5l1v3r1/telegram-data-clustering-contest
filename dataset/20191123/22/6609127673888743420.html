        <b>A CANCER treatment room at Glasgow’s crisis-hit Royal Hospital for Children has still not opened — more than four years after it was built.</b>
      </p>
      <p>And now the mum of a cancer patient who died at the scandal-hit hospital has branded the facility “sick”.</p>

      <p>Donna-Louise Hurrell, 40, believes daughter Rosie Veronica Mitchell, who passed away in January aged seven, could have benefited from care at a hub designed to tackle neuroblastoma.</p>
      <p>But we can reveal the MIBG cancer treatment room will not open until at least the spring at Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for Children — part of the Queen Elizabeth University campus plagued by infection outbreaks.</p>
      <p>Donna-Louise, of Port Glasgow, Renfrewshire, claimed vital chemotherapy for Rosie was delayed at least twice after bug problems at the facility, which opened in June 2015.</p>
      <p>The mum said: “Rosie fought as hard as she could but in the end she was let down.</p>
      <p>“She was treated latterly in a ‘sick building’ where she was so busy having to deal with the effects of infection issues that she didn’t always have the energy or support needed to fight the cancer.”</p>

      <p>Donna-Louise claims the lead-lined room is in ward 2A — one of two paediatric cancer wards at the Royal Hospital for Children.</p>
      <p>The sites have been closed since last September following a string of infections and are not expected to reopen until at least March — along with the treatment room.</p>
      <p>The mum said: “Rosie potentially could have benefited from it but instead had to go on the waiting list to get it elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“Rosie was put on the waiting list in London. By the time she got there in January her cancer had progressed so far she couldn’t get the treatment.</p>
      <p>“If that room had been available in that hospital she would have got treatment quicker. Would that have made a difference to her outcome?”</p>
      <p>The £842million superhospital plunged into government control this week.</p>
      <p>Donna-Louise blasted the lack of transparency and care by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>
      <p>She said: “The health board are not being as open and transparent as they should be.</p>

      <p>“I don’t think the Government are doing a good enough of holding them to account at all.</p>
      <p>“Nobody has written to me to apologise for what Rosie had to go through in that hospital. It should never have happened.”</p>
      <p>The MIBG room was built with the hospital in 2015. It will see nuclear medicine scans used to check for changes in the adrenal glands and surrounding tissues.</p>
      <p>It’s understood that the therapy is only available currently at the University College Hospital and the Royal Marsden hospitals in London.</p>

      <p>Another parent said the special room “has never been in use”. They claimed funding was approved last year to train staff and carry out work.</p>
      <p>A source added: “The point of having it in the new hospital was so children wouldn’t have to travel to London for it. It would have reduced the waiting list for kids.”</p>

      <p>Labour’s health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: “The MIBG room must be fully resourced and the safe reopening of the children’s cancer wards should be the Government’s top priority.”</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the health board said the MIBG room was built as a “potential new” service.</p>
      <p>She added: “Work is under way to upgrade the MIBG room in readiness for the launch of the service in spring next year when wards 2A and 2B reopen.”</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We understand NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are working to ensure that both the room and the surrounding environment are ready to admit patients both safely and as soon as possible.”</p>
