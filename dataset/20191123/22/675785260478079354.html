      <h1>Tony Adams explains how Jose Mourinho has just put huge pressure on Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Unai Emery's Arsenal performed "abysmally" and were fortunate to draw against relegation-threatened Southampton on Saturday, according to former Gunners captain Tony Adams</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:17:49+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham sacking Mauricio Pochettino and hiring Jose Mourinho has piled the pressure on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> manager Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>That's according to former Gunners captain Tony Adams, who has urged the north London club to take a leaf out of their neighbour's book and sack Emery.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have recorded just one win in their past eight matches under the Spaniard, and struggled to draw against relegation-threatened <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Saints were leaving with all three points from the clash before Alexandre Lacazette came to the rescue for Arsenal, netting an equaliser with the last kick of the game.</p>
      <p>Emery took full responsibility for the poor performance, and vowed to improve results.</p>

      <p>But Adams has already seen enough and wants to see Arsenal pull the trigger in the same way <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> did on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"That was absolutely awful," said Adams on BT Sport. "I can't remember ever seeing a side defend that badly. This coach is not improving these players.</p>
      <p>"That means we need a new coach. What has happened across north London at Tottenham has to put huge pressure on this guy.</p>
      <p>"The fans won't be happy with this and what they are seeing. This group of players is going backwards under Emery. It was abysmal."</p>

      <p>Emery spoke to the press following Saturday's draw, and admitted he needs to start "connecting" with the supporters who are growing increasingly frustrated.</p>
      <p>He said: "The club are supporting me every day and also I have a responsibility.</p>
      <p>"I know I can do better, I can take more performances with the players and I'm going to try to do that. Now my job is to analyse, to try to move on with confidence with the players.</p>

      <p>"It's difficult but we need to move on in the next days. After analysing that match we are going to play at home again on Thursday, prepare as well as possible.</p>
      <p>"We know, and I know, that we need to connect with our supporters."</p>
