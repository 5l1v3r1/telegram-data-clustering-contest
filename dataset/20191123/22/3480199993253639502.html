      <p>Gareth Bale was jeered on his Bernabeu return but made a goal as Real Madrid beat Real Sociedad 3-1.</p>
      <p>Bale was heavily criticised in Spain after celebrating Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification on Tuesday behind a flag which said ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid – In That Order’.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old had played four times for Wales since his last Real appearance on October 5 and was booed as he appeared as a 67th-minute substitute.</p>

      <p>But Bale set up Real’s third-goal clincher within six minutes, his run and cross ending with Luka Modric firing home.</p>
      <p>Willian Jose pounced on Sergio Ramos’ second-minute mistake to give Sociedad the lead but Karim Benzema and Federico Valverde turned it around.</p>
      <p>Real stay second on goal difference after Barcelona grabbed a late winner to beat bottom-of-the-table Leganes 2-1.</p>
      <p>Youssef En-Nesyri gave the hosts an early lead, but Luis Suarez headed a 52nd-minute equaliser from Lionel Messi’s free-kick.</p>

      <p>Arturo Vidal secured victory 10 minutes from time when his mis-hit shot floated over the head of Leganes goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar, the goal standing after a VAR check for offside.</p>
      <p>Atletico Madrid’s title hopes were dented in a 1-1 draw at Granada.</p>
      <p>Renan Lodi put Atletico ahead on the hour mark, but German Sanchez headed an equaliser seven minutes later.</p>
      <p>Sergio Canales struck in the third minute of stoppage time as Real Betis overcame Valencia 2-1, Joaquin having earlier cancelled out Maxi Gomes’ goal.</p>

      <p>Bundesliga leaders Borussia Monchengladbach saw their four-point lead cut to one after a 2-0 defeat at Union Berlin.</p>
      <p>Anthony Ujah gave Union a 15th-minute lead and Sebastian Andersson wrapped up victory in stoppage time.</p>
      <p>RB Leipzig and Bayern Munich took advantage of Monchengladbach’s slip with comfortable wins.</p>
      <p>Second-placed Leipzig brushed aside FC Cologne 4-1 at home with Tino Werner opening the scoring on his 200th Bundesliga outing.</p>

      <p>Emil Forsberg (two) and Konrad Laimer were also on target, with Rafael Czichos replying for Cologne.</p>
      <p>Bayern won 4-0 win at Fortuna Dusseldorf as Benjamin Pavard, Corentin Tolisso and Serge Gnabry put them in first-half control and Philippe Coutinho added a fourth 20 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>It was the first time Robert Lewandowski failed to score in a league match this season, but Hansi Flick has won all three of his games as interim Bayern coach.</p>
      <p>Freiburg are fourth after drawing 1-1 at Bayer Leverkusen, Lucas Holer’s early effort cancelled out by Moussa Diaby.</p>

      <p>Amine Harit and Benito Raman scored in a 2-1 Schalke success at Werder Bremen, for whom Yuya Osako netted, while Wolfsburg won 2-0 at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Wout Weghorst and Joao Victor scored in each half for the visitors, who had Marcel Tisserand sent off after receiving a second yellow card.</p>
      <p>Juventus recovered from a goal down to win 3-1 at Atalanta and stay top of Serie A.</p>
      <p>Robin Gosens gave the hosts a 56th-minute lead, but Gonzalo Higuain scored twice in the final 20 minutes and Paul Dybala marked his 200th Serie A appearance by sealing matters in the final seconds.</p>

      <p>Kasper Dolberg halved the deficit 12 minutes from time but Nice defender Patrick Burner picked up a second booking in the closing stages.</p>
      <p>Angers moved into second spot – nine points behind leaders Paris St Germain – with a 1-0 victory over Nimes, Dijon beat Rennes 2-1 and Strasbourg won 4-0 at Amiens.</p>
      <p>Brest and Nantes and Metz and Reims shared the spoils in 1-1 draws.</p>
