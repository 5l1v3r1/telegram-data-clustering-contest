        <b>DEREK Mackay revealed the SNP’s latest Christmas wish as he demanded Holyrood’s credit limit is more than tripled to £10billion.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Finance Secretary insisted the next UK Government must green-light turbocharged borrowing powers so he can “boost the economy and help tackle climate change”.</p>

      <p>And he argued his current limit — £3billion with a £450million annual spend — amounted to a “straitjacket imposed on Scotland”.</p>
      <p>The manifesto demand will be tabled during any hung parliament talks with Labour after the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>Legal permission to hold a second indy vote in 2020 is top of the list of SNP wants for negotiations in the event of no overall majority.</p>
      <p>An SNP spokesman said Mr Mackay’s call for increased borrowing would also be “on the table” in that scenario. And the Finance Secretary said the ability to spend £550million more each year would increase the Scottish Government’s spending power by £2.75billion over the next five years.</p>

      <p>He said: “SNP MPs will push the next UK Government to remove the fiscal straitjacket imposed on Scotland and unlock nearly £3billion over the next parliament — money that we would invest in the country’s infrastructure to boost the economy and help tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>“The SNP Government has ambitious plans to increase infrastructure investment to support public services, boost the economy and tackle the climate emergency, but these plans are hamstrung by the financial restrictions placed on Holyrood by the UK Government.”</p>
      <p>But the cash bid has sparked claims from the Tories that Mr Mackay risked saddling future generations with debts to pay for SNP “election bribes”.</p>
      <p>The SNP’s manifesto, due this week, will spell out how Mr Mackay wants an increase in the overdraft to £10billion, with the ability to rack up £1billion of debt a year.</p>
      <p>A Nats spokesman said there was no specific list of things Mr Mackay wanted the extra cash for.</p>
      <p>The demand comes after complaints from Mr Mackay that the £3billion borrowing limit — under powers devolved in 2017 — wasn’t enough.</p>
      <p>In 2017/18, the Government borrowed the maximum £450million over a 25-year term, plus a further £250million in 2018/19, but over ten years.</p>
      <p>In May, Mr Mackay said he aimed to borrow “between £250million and £450million” a year until 2026, which he said “strikes the right balance between supporting the economy” and using borrowing powers “prudently”.</p>

      <p>Scottish Tory shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: “Derek Mackay has already maxed out Scotland’s credit card by borrowing millions on taxpayers. His big plan now appears to be to get into even deeper debt by applying for a new one.</p>
      <p>“As every household knows, it’s best not to put monthly bills on the credit card. Rather than going even deeper into the red to pay for SNP election bribes, Mr Mackay needs to get a grip — or it’ll be our children and grandchildren who will be forced to pay off his inept bungling.”</p>
      <p>The borrowing bid comes despite claims by economic experts at Strathclyde University’s Fraser of Allander Institute that the Scottish Government’s capital cash allocation from Westminster has “increased healthily” in recent years.</p>
      <p>The group said the pot was almost £1billion higher than it was in 2016/17 and has helped to fund SNP pledges like new childcare facilities and affordable homes.</p>
      <blockquote>Derek Mackay's big plan now appears to be to get into even deeper debt by applying for a new one.</blockquote>
      <p>The capital grant is due to increase by a further £300million — six per cent — in 2020/21, taking the allocation “back to levels last seen in the pre-austerity days of 2010/11”.</p>
      <p>Borrowed capital cash goes into a separate pot from day-to-day spending and can be used for infrastructure projects.</p>
      <p>The demand is the latest on a wish list that Nicola Sturgeon will wield after the General Election if there’s a hung parliament and the SNP hold the balance of power.</p>
      <p>Other wants are set to include removing Trident nuclear subs from their Faslane base on the Clyde, ending austerity, powers for Holyrood over migration, and devolution of drug and employment laws.</p>

      <p>On the campaign trail today, Ms Sturgeon and rival Willie Rennie locked horns in the UK’s closest seat, North East Fife, where just two votes separate the SNP and Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>The First Minister visited a hairdressers in Leven with candidate Stephen Gethins — where she gave him a trim and larked around on a pink moped.</p>
      <p>Backing Mr Gethins, the incumbent MP,  Ms Sturgeon said: “The SNP is Scotland’s Remain party, and Stephen Gethins has shown what a superb representative he is — both as a local MP here and as one of the main anti-Brexit voices at Westminster.</p>
      <p>“It is people like Stephen that we need to have in the next parliament to stop Boris Johnson, the Tories and Brexit in its tracks.”</p>

      <p>In St Andrews, Mr Rennie hit out at Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said on Friday night he’d remain “neutral” on any future vote on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Rennie said: “Jeremy Corbyn has now made sitting on the fence his official position. It’s unbelievable that he thinks as Prime Minister he can get away without having an opinion on the national crisis of our time.</p>
      <p>“The Liberal Democrats are the home of Remain. Labour cannot be trusted.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who wants to put this constitutional chaos to bed needs to join our fight for a brighter future.”</p>
      <p>North East Fife was previously held by Lib Dem grandee Sir Menzies Campbell from 1983 until the SNP’s 2015 landslide, when they won by 4,344 votes.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Mr Gethins’ majority was chopped to just two.</p>
      <p>But Lib Dem sources are confident of snatching the seat back with ex-cop Wendy Chamberlain as their candidate.</p>
