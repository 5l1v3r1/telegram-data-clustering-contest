      <p>We never thought we’d see the day when Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) would be reaching out to those in need and offering her support but the reformed character is set to offer a lifeline to struggling teenager Sid Sumner (Billy Price).</p>
      <p>When he turns up at the school to see Juliet Quinn (Niamh Blackshaw) and she soon realises that he has been sleeping rough since he pushed his dad Stuart to his death. He had been trapped in racist Stuart’s world, with his bigoted dad hoping for him to take his place in the far right group.</p>

      <p>However, Sid could see what his dad was doing was wrong and stepped in to save Ste Hay’s (Kieron Richardson) life – leading to Stuart plunging to his death. Since then, Sid has disappeared but he seeks help from Juliet.</p>
      <p>Sienna spots the exchange and realises just what Sid is going through – moved to tears, she embraces him and offers him a place to stay. Can she and Juliet help Sid get back on his feet?</p>

      <p>Speaking to Metro.co.uk recently, Billy said: ‘I think now that his dad’s gone, Sid can find himself as his own person. Get to make his own opinions about life, his own views, and he can like who he wants to like. He has that freedom now to just be his own person, which is really nice because that gives me a chance as an actor and Sid, as a character, to play with all the new stuff that he hasn’t been able to do before.</p>

      <p>‘Hollyoaks are definitely exploring his vulnerability quite a lot, so it’s really nice as an actor to be a part of that. There is so much area there for them to explore with Sid — what happened with his dad, the vulnerability, the relationships he’s never been able to have, the views that he used to have that he now needs to get over.</p>
      <p>‘There’s literally so much and I think it’ll be a great chance for them to create a new character that everyone wants to get to know.’</p>
