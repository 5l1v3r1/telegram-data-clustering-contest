      <p>The talk of having cross-promotional fights between <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> and other promotions such as <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/bellator">Bellator</a> has been prevalent for a very long time, however, Dana White has always steered clear from the possibility of it happening.</p>
      <p>Bellator analyst and Lightweight fighter Josh Thomson was interviewed by BJPenn's Natasha Hooper and during the conversation, he opened up on why the fighters in Bellator are just as good as the top-tier fighters in the UFC.</p>
      <p>Thomson even quoted Nick Diaz while stating the reason why Dana White has been apprehensive to engage in a war between promotions.</p>
      <p>The former UFC fighter opined that Bellator Welterweight Champion Douglas Lima could knock out both Kamaru Usman and Colby Covington if given the chance before putting Lima as the best Welterweight in the world.</p>
      <blockquote>“People wanna say ‘Oh, the UFC has [Kamaru] Usman, they’ve got Colby Covington. I would put Lima against those two guys any day of the week and twice on Sunday! “I think Lima could knock them both out. I think Lima is just as big as Usman, and he’s a way better striker and can stop the takedowns. So, if you want to match those guys up? All we’re waiting is for the go-ahead from Dana. If they wanna make that fight, let’s make that fight!</blockquote>
      <p>Thomson even revealed his predictions regarding potential fights such as Ryan Bader vs. Stipe Miocic and Gegard Mousasi vs. Israel Adesanya.</p>
      <p>He claimed that Bader beats Miocic in his book, however, added that the current Bellator Heavyweight Champion would have a hard time going up against Daniel Cormier. He claimed that Mousasi has the tools to counteract the Last Stylebender's unorthodox stand-up game and backed the former UFC fighter to go over the current UFC Middleweight Champion.</p>
      <blockquote>"Even Ryan Bader vs Stipe Miocic, I think he [Bader] beats him, because he’s wrestling is better, his striking is faster. Now, I’m not saying he has the power of Stipe, but when it comes to the wrestling aspect and pushing the pace, Ryan Bader can beat Stipe- there’s no doubt in my mind. But if I was to match Bader with [Daniel] Cormier, Ryan would have a way harder time of getting the win, if at all."</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“At 185 pounds, I put Gegard Mousasi or [Rafael] Lovato Jr against [Israel] Adesanya all day long. Mousasi can nullify his standup, ‘cos he’s such a good defensive stand up fighter as well as an offensive stand up fighter. He’s also hands-down way better on the ground. Gegard could win on the feet or on the ground.”</blockquote>
      <p>He added that Dana White's approval is all that is needed to witness the top fighters from the rival promotions go toe-to-toe against each other.</p>
      <p>According to Thomson, White would have to bury his ego and let the fights happen. However, he knows it may not become a reality as UFC's business could take a hit if their fighters lose in cross-promotional bouts.</p>
      <blockquote>“That’s ‘cos Dana feels he has a lot to lose. But to quote the famous Nick Diaz, ‘Don’t be scared homie. It’s one of those things, he has to bury his ego and put it to the side, but I know it’s not good for business if their guys lose, I understand that’s why."
