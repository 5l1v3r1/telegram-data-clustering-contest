      <p>LIHUE, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - A 47-year-old Kekaha man has been arrested, suspected in two wallet snatchings at Kukui Grove.</p>
      <p>Kauai officials say Steven Kyle Hookano was arrested late Friday afternoon. He was taken in on suspicion of two counts of fourth-degree theft.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage from Oct. 25 showed a man who officials say was Hookano closely following someone at Times Supermarket before grabbing their wallet and running toward the exit.</p>
      <p>About a half an hour later, the same man was seen at Longs Drugs where a second victim reported the same thing happened to them.</p>
      <p>Kauai police credit anonymous tips submitted to CrimeStoppers in helping identify and arrest the suspect.</p>
      <p>“We appreciate the efforts of our officers, the community, and all involved. We also continue to encourage the community to remain vigilant with your belongings, keeping a close eye on them at all times, and to be aware of any suspicious activity while shopping,” Kauai Police Chief Todd Raybuck said.</p>
      <p>Hookano was released on Friday on $1,000 bail for one count of fourth-degree theft. He was released pending investigation on another charge.</p>
      <p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>
