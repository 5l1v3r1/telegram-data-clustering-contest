      <h1>Micah Parsons Issues Promise After Loss To Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:17:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>The Penn State Nittany Lion’ hopes of making the College Football Playoff were dashed on Saturday afternoon. No. 2 Ohio State was just too tough on defense for the Penn State offense as the Buckeyes walked out with a 28-17 win.</p>
      <p>It’s the third-straight win for Ohio State over Penn State.</p>
      <p>After the game, star linebacker Micah Parsons had a message for the Nittany Lions faithful.</p>
      <p>“Don’t give up on us I promise we gonna go harder! Ima try harder to bring it back for us!” he said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>With the loss, Penn State falls to 9-2 on the season, but still sits in solid position for a New Year’s Six bowl game. The Nittany Lions looked like they had at least a Rose Bowl berth wrapped up just a few weeks ago, but two losses in the last three weeks dashed those hopes.</p>
      <p>James Franklin and company finish the season with a home game against Rutgers. A win there would give Franklin his third 10-win season as the head coach at Penn State.</p>
      <p>As for Parsons, the star linebacker has at least one more year as a Nittany Lion. Can he bring a Big Ten title to Penn State?</p>
      <p>We’ll find out.</p>
