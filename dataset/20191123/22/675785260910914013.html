      <p>A mum has vowed never to step foot in a supermarket ever again following a humiliating row over a turkey.</p>
      <p>Claire Harrison dropped into a Tesco near her home in Plymouth to do some shopping with her husband, auntie and mum.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old picked out some items before heading to the self-service checkouts and paying for her shopping, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-familys-humiliating-row-tesco-3508259">Plymouth Live reported</a> .</p>
      <p>Despite having scanned all of their food through the tills, the family claims, members of staff then raced over to demand proof of payment.</p>
      <p>"I felt so humiliated with all them customers in there," the mother-of-five said.</p>

      <p>"I have been going there for the last eight years and I will never, ever step foot in there again.</p>
      <p>"I am a 31-year-old mum with five kids, I ain't no criminal."</p>
      <p>Reliving the humiliating incident, Claire explained how the confrontation began.</p>
      <p>"My auntie was on one till, my husband on another and my mum on the next one over," she said.</p>

      <p>"My auntie bought her shopping, and paid for it, and my husband (who I was stood with) did the same.</p>
      <p>"Then, one of the members of staff in the self-checkout area went over to my auntie and said; 'have you paid for that?' and she said, 'yes, I have."</p>
      <p>"They went around our shopping bags, ripped the receipt out of my auntie's shopping bag. With my husband, they ripped the receipt straight out of his hand."</p>

      <p>The shopping trip had been organised so Claire's mum could pick up a turkey for Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>She said the birds are 'overpriced' in Morrisons - where they're going for £30 each - leading them to Tescos.</p>
      <p>There they found a £20 bird, opting for the slightly pricier model than the bargain £16 bird that was on offer but appeared slightly "dented".</p>
      <p>"My mum, she paid for her stuff on her bank card and bought a turkey for Christmas separately," Claire explained.</p>
      <p>"They asked her for her receipt and she didn't know what she had done with it.</p>

      <p>"She thought she might have left it in the shopping trolley. She found it and it was yanked out of her hand.</p>
      <p>"There was no apology, nothing."</p>
      <p>Claire said the checkout area was packed full of shoppers - but no-one else was confronted.</p>
      <p>Shocked and enraged, Claire confronted staff before storming out with her family after proving they had actually paid.</p>
      <p>"I stood my ground," Claire said. "I wasn't having them treating my auntie, husband and mum like that.</p>
      <p>"I said; 'who the hell do you think you are?'</p>
      <p>"I did get really angry, so did my auntie.</p>
      <p>"Why did they approach us and not anybody else?"</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Tesco for comment.</p>
