      <h1>Auburn Player Suspended For 1st Half Of The Iron Bowl</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T22:18:37+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Next weekend, the Auburn Tigers will have to play the first half against the Alabama Crimson Tide without a marquee defender. Jamien Sherwood was ejected on Saturday for targeting.</p>
      <p>To make matters worse for the Tigers, the ejection for Sherwood took place against Samford. He clearly hit the opposing quarterback up high, but an argument could be made that it was a bang-bang play.</p>
      <p>However, the refs believed it was a hit that could’ve been avoided by the sophomore safety.</p>
      <p>Due to NCAA rules, Sherwood is suspended for the first half of next weekend’s game. Gus Malzahn <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyMacUMP/status/1198317554810474496?s=20">wasn’t too happy with the call</a>, pleading to the official “Mark. Mark. We’ve got the Iron Bowl next week.”</p>
      <p>Auburn was already going to be at a disadvantage because of Alabama’s depth at wide receiver. The loss of Sherwood is only going to magnify the defense’s weakness.</p>
      <p>Here’s the targeting call on Sherwood:</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Sherwood has 40 tackles and five pass deflections and a fumble recovery this season. The Tigers are going to need an unproven defensive back on their roster to step up in his absence.</p>
      <p>Kickoff between Alabama and Auburn will be at 3:30 p.m. ET from Jordan-Hare Stadium.</p>
      <p>As always, the Iron Bowl will be on CBS.</p>
