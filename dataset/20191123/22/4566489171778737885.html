      <p>All 18 of Brenda Lee's Christmas recordings that she recorded for Decca Records back in the '50s and '60s are now available on vinyl via Decca/MCA Nashville/UMe.</p>

It was even featured in several films including the perennial classic holiday film <i>Home Alone</i>.</p>
      <p>This vinyl collection includes her first holiday single "Christy Christmas," as well as "I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus," which is from her very first recording session when she was just 11 years old; moreover, it features every song from her 1964 holiday album, <i>Merry Christmas From Brenda Lee</i>.</p>
      <p>If that weren't enough, Lee's new vinyl edition features three songs that are originally only available on the Japanese release of her 1964 album, all of which are making their American debut on vinyl. These three tracks include "White Christmas," "Silent Night" and "Jingle Bells."</p>
