      <p>There was drama during Saturday night's I'm A Celebrity when Jacqueline Jossa broke down live on air.</p>
      <p>It would be fair to say that the ex-Eastenders actress has struggled a bit with the trials on this year's show and it was news of the latest one that reduced her to tears in front of millions of viewers.</p>
      <p>While the majority of each episode of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> is recorded footage, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec's</a> links are live as is the bit each day when they go into camp to reveal who the public have voted to take on the Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>And it was the reveal that she would be facing Sunday's trial alongside Ian Wright that prompted Jacqueline cry, <i><b>as you can see in the footage above taken from ITV,</b> </i>with her campmates rushing to console her as she could be heard saying "I don't want to do it anymore."</p>
      <p>The latest trial is called Crevis of Cruelty and will see Ian and Jacqueline search a series of underground tunnels and chambers for vital stars, as water rises around them.</p>
      <p>As always, they will be joined by all sorts of creepy crawlies with spiders, snakes and baby crocodiles among the critters they will encounter.</p>
      <p>"Two celebrities are about to get down and dirty in an underground cavern where a world of woes await," Ant &amp; Dec said in the teaser video, adding "The stars are in reach, but who can keep their head while the crawl through the Crevice of Cruelty?"</p>
