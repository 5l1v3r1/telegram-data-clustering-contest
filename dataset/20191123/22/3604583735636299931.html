      <p>PUNTERS may not have known it but a talented teenager called one of the races at the weekend's Ballarat Cup.</p>
      <p>Swan Hill's Dayne Barry, 17, has been calling races since 2014.</p>
      <p>Barry has always loved horse racing and called his first race at Mt Wycheproof when he was just 12 years old.</p>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon he called Race 4 - the Magic Millions 2YO Clockwise Classic over 1000 metres.</p>
      <p>He called the race last year and so when he was asked back for this year's event he jumped at the opportunity.</p>
      <p>When calling races he feeds off the crowd.</p>
      <p>"I love the atmosphere and the excitement of the crowds," he said.</p>
      <p>"But it's not always easy but I love to call a good competitive race."</p>
      <p>He practices at his local track in Swan Hill and also near Bendigo.</p>
      <p>With a passion for horse racing, he hopes to be make a name for himself as a career race caller, though he understands there are not a lot of jobs available and that he would have to leave his home town to do so.</p>
      <p>If he cannot land a job as a race caller he would still like to be involved in the industry, perhaps as a trainer.</p>
