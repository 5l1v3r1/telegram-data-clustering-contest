      <p>Pep Guardiola's men were at risk of falling further behind in the high-speed chase at the top of the table, however, they came from a goal down to beat <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/chelsea">Chelsea</a> 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>Chelsea's ever-smiling midfield enforcer N'Golo Kante opened his team's account in the 21st minute, as he received a precise through ball from Mateo Kovacic to stab the ball beyond the reach of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-city">Manchester City's</a> Ederson Moraes.</p>
      <p>A few minutes later, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/kevin-de-bruyne">Kevin De Bruyne</a> was on hand to pull the hosts level, albeit a welcome deflection from Kurt Zouma.</p>
      <p>The Cityzens went ahead in the 37th minute, as Riyad Mahrez jinxed his way into the Chelsea box before sending the ball into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>Man City moved into third place with this victory as Chelsea fell to fourth, 2 points behind the defending champions. In this article, we discuss a few reasons why Guardiola's men won.</p>

      <p>This was a tricky fixture for the Cityzens, as it came on the heels of the embarrassing loss at Anfield last time out.</p>
      <p>Chelsea came out fighting, as they matched the defending champions pound for pound. They chased every loose ball, won the 50-50 chances, and energetically took the fight to the Manchester City defensive area.</p>
      <p>Their positive persistence paid off early enough, as N'Golo Kante put the visitors ahead in the 21st minute. As it stood, City were behind the table-toppers from Merseyside by 12 points, a double-figure deficit for the first time in the campaign.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the spectre of another humiliating loss loomed large at the Etihad, however, the response was instant. The irrepressible Kevin De Bruyne led the charge, as he produced yet another Man of the Match performance, exquisitely cutting onto his left foot on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area before whipping his shot past the Chelsea goalmouth for the equaliser.</p>
      <p>With the stakes sky-high, an instant response was just what the doctor ordered.</p>
