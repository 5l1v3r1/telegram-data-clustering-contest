      <h1>Steve Bruce reveals the secret behind Jack Grealish's development into Aston Villa's 'jewel in the crown'</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/25/brink-england-call-up-aston-villas-prized-asset-jack-grealish/">Jack Grealish</a> could play for any of the top clubs in Europe, according to his former manager Steve Bruce, who revealed Aston Villa’s “jewel in the crown” owes a huge debt to one of his childhood friends.</p>
      <p>Bruce admitted he would love to take all the credit for helping to turn Grealish into one of England’s most exciting creative players, but instead pointed to the work done by another former Academy player at Villa for the huge impact he had on his career.</p>
      <p>Oli Stevenson was promoted to become the first team’s strength and conditioning coach at Villa, under Bruce, when the club was on the brink of going into administration in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>As a close friend of Grealish, Stevenson spent a huge amount of time with the 24-year-old and turned him into an elite athlete, as well as a gifted footballer, with a specially tailored fitness program.</p>
      <p>“I'd love to say it was all me,” said Bruce, ahead of his return to Villa Park with Newcastle United. “He got a horrible injury, got an injury in pre-season where he damaged a kidney.</p>
      <p>“The perception of Grealish is he wants to just play football – he’s an absolute football nut and of course he's young and he's a good looking kid and all the rest of that, but he wanted to play.</p>

      <p>“But he damaged his kidney so badly and was in the hospital for three weeks. And then he came out and missed four or five months. And his mate, Oli, who we took from the Academy because we were skint and couldn’t afford one [fitness coach], we employed him for the first team.</p>
      <p>“We brought the kid, who grew up with Jack and didn’t quite make it as a footballer, he became the strength and conditioning coach in the gym.</p>
      <p>“And he, single-handedly for me, changed him. In the gym and what he worked on - he came out after six months, and we looked at him and went 'oh my god.’ Physique wise, he's a beast now. I think there was a little bit of shock really [at the time] but he is a terrific player.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether Grealish would have to leave Villa to fulfil his potential and break into the England squad, Bruce recoiled.</p>
      <p>“Do you want me killed?” he replied, aware he is already unpopular in that part of Birmingham. “I have to say fair play to the [Aston Villa] owners, even though they sacked me.</p>
      <p>“The first thing they did was to give Jack Grealish a new five-year contract and say we want to build the team around him. How refreshing to every Villa supporter that was.</p>
      <p>“He is the crown jewel and he never wanted to leave. It would be difficult for anyone to buy him with the size of contract he has got, but he could play for any team, Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal … any team. I rate him that highly.”</p>
