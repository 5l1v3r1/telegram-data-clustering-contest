      <p>Collaborating for the first time since 2009’s <i>Nowhere Boy</i>, Sam and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are bringing <b><i>A Million Little Pieces </i></b>to the screen, a passion project which the married couple wrote together. Sam, who also directed the film, has had a special attachment to the material for years. A bond so strong that even when James Frey, author of the source material, was chastised for fabricating some of the details in his book, Sam was still eager to to tell this story.</p>
      <p>The film, which stars her husband in the leading role, follows a version of Frey who, like in the memoir, is left in rehab to work the drug addiction out of his system.</p>
      <p>We Got This Covered recently had the opportunity to speak with both Sam and Aaron about the upcoming film. You can check out our conversation with the director down below, in which discussed her experience partnering with her husband again, as well as working alongside the likes of Billy Bob Thornton, Juliette Lewis, and Giovanni Ribisi. Enjoy!</p>
      <p>
        <i>It’s</i>
        <i> my understanding that you’ve spent a great deal of time trying to get your hands on this project, which is interesting to me because the book itself has been the subject of some extensive controversy that I would’ve thought would destroy its chances at getting a movie. Can you touch on what about this project, about this book, was so irresistible to you?</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Well yeah, you’re right. It almost lost the chance to be made, and I always thought it should have the chance to be made because it was such a powerful tale of hope for me. And the physical fact of what James Frey has been through, the journey of recovery from addiction and then the very public journey with the shaming and everything, and that he stands here 26 years sober is a true testament to him. I think that when I read the book, I felt the spirit of that and I felt the spirit of him and the story of survival. And I think that it’s an important story to be told, one that offers hope at the end. That’s the thing that resonated with me.</p>
      <p>
        <i>This, as you mentioned, is a story about addiction. A lot of other films have tackled this light-and-dark subject before, but I liked the way you specifically illustrated James’ struggles. I was wondering when you first read the back, before you were even a filmmaker, were you picturing the cinematic elements of the story? Did those sort of ideas bleed through the page?</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Yeah, most definitely. I read this when I was an artist and a photographer. I remember reading it and visually being able to see what kind of movie it could be, and I was visually able to see the characters and how they could come to life. I tracked the book and followed which studio and which filmmakers were attached to it, and I [was always envious] that I couldn’t see what kind of movie it would be.</p>
      <p>So I always tracked it, which was to my advantage when the rights went back to James Frey. It’s been an interesting journey, and [after I got a hold of him] he said to me, “well, I’d love for you to go and make it. I just want it to be a creative experience. I made it in the spirit of art, and I’d like you to do the same. I’m not going to be there unless you need me and you should be as creative as you like with the material,” which is a real gift from the author.</p>
      <p>
        <i>That’s probably as good as a gift you can get from an author.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Yeah, it was great, because I would just call him up and say, “Miles Davis, tell me some stories about him.” And he would say, “here’s his number, why don’t you call him yourself?” It was really helpful to call up James and ask him what kind of cigarettes did he smoke and “when you were there, how did you feel about this?” So to have him as a resource but also as someone who didn’t mind how you interpreted their work was a total gift.</p>
      <p>
        <i>So was that mostly your professional relationship with him? I did read the article about you and your husband that he wrote, and I really enjoyed that, but in terms of making the film, he gave you a total free pass with the material?</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Yeah, a total free pass. And there came a point where Aaron and I, after two years, wrote the script and asked James if he would like to read it before we submit it for financing? And he said, “well, do you want me to read it? Would it be helpful?” And I thought about it, and I said, “actually I think I would prefer if you didn’t read it at this point.” And he was like, “okay, carry on!”</p>
      <p>And that’s unusual.</p>

      <p>
        <i>Yeah, especially coming off the brink of Doctor Sleep. It’s funny how authors can be so protective of their work in some cases and be so open to interpretation in others. But speaking of your husband, the two of you haven’t worked together since Nowhere Boy. And I was particularly excited to talk to you because I am a huge Beatles fan and I wanted to thank you for actually making a Beatles movie, because there doesn’t seem to be one anywhere else.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: You’re so kind.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Other than the simple fact that Aaron is your husband, what made you think that he was perfect for the role? What about those two personalities sort of clicked in your mind?</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Do you mean for the role of James, or for the role of Lennon.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Well, I meant James. But now I want to hear both!</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Here’s the thing: when Aaron turned up on my doorstop to audition for John Lennon, I opened the door to Lennon. And I knew Lennon pretty well at this point through all of my research and everything I’d watched and read and hard. I had met with some actors who did brilliant and clever impersonations of Lennon. But I hadn’t met one who, when I opened the door, the head tilt was exactly the right way; the mannerisms, the walk, it wasn’t an impersonation, it was an embodiment. That was when I first met him, and I obviously I have lived with various characters and roles, some I’ve enjoyed living with more than others – I did not enjoy Ray from <i>Nocturnal Animals</i>. When I got the rights to the book, I went after them because I could see him playing James so well. I was trying to find material with Aaron which would show the quality that he has an actor, and also give him the opportunity to embody such a strong character.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Going back to the idea that you have to live with his characters, did it help you to have this version of James with you at all times when it came making the movie?</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Yeah, and I think because we wrote it together, we had sort of inhabited the world of <i>A Million Little Pieces </i>and of James already. When Aaron starts to even entertain the idea of playing the character, I see him slowly slip away into who that person away; his eating habits will change; the way he walks will start to shift. He gets so deep into the embodiment of that person, so by the time that we got to the set, it was a huge advantage that we had immersed ourselves in the material. He was almost James by the time we stepped on set.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Well, it’s nice to know that you had so many people helping you. You had James helping you; you had Aaron helping you; you had Aaron’s James helping you.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: I don’t think it was help in the normal sense, it was a collaboration between us, where we could all be around for the common purpose of getting the story told.</p>
      <p>
        <i>I think it’s safe to say that in addition to your husband, this is the most prolific or expansive cast that you’ve had working with you. I’ve spoken with directors in the past who’ve said that they appreciated the moral contribution their more veteran actors simply brought to the set every day. I was wondering what the dynamic was with Billy Bob Thornton and Juliette Lewis, and what sort of presence they brought to the set?</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sam Taylor-Johnson</b>: Both of them were extremely generous in doing this because this was one for the soul, not one for the money. They both showed up completely immersed in the sense that they showed up on the set ready to go and had studied their character and done the ground work. So they were wonderful, professional human beings to bounce off of.</p>
      <p>And Billy Bob, who is also a director and who is also a writer, understood the dynamic of the set. And he brought on a lot of ideas including the wardrobe ones – which were fantastic – but he could also improvise, which Aaron liked. You know, Juliette Lewis was just phenomenal. She had studied what it is to be a counselor within the facility, and that time that she gave us was very precious.</p>
      <p>And Billy Bob, he also said, “I think this is the first time I’ve had to share a trailer with two other people in a very long time.” So yeah, their spirit was incredible.</p>
      <p><i><b>A Million Little Pieces </b></i>will hit theaters on December 6, 2019.</p>
