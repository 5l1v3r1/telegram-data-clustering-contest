      <p>The daughter of a woman who died after escaping from a mental health unit said her family are at ‘rock bottom’ following their loss.</p>
      <p>Leah Fletcher, 24, fears her mum Georgina committed suicide after going missing from Lakeside Mental Health centre in Houndslow on October 31<sup>st</sup>.</p>
      <p>She claims her mum, known as Gina to her friends, had gone missing 15-20 times and expressed suicidal thoughts in the run up to being sectioned at the West London practice.</p>
      <p>She and her siblings desperately clung on to the hope their mum, 50, would be found alive and spent over<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/desperate-plea-from-family-of-mum-who-went-missing-from-mental-health-hospital-11167585/"> two weeks frantically searching for her</a> with the help of the public.</p>
      <p>But on Sunday November 17, they received the devastating news that a body had been found in Hounslow Heath.</p>

      <p>Leah, who has a five-year-old son, told metro.co.uk: ‘It’s absolutely devastating. How do you tell your kids that nanny has gone to sleep, or that nanny is in heaven?</p>

      <p>‘She loved her grandkids more than anything. It’s absolutely heart breaking.</p>
      <p>‘My mum had an awful upbringing, but she still made sure that her kids had everything we needed. She was such a lovely person. She was beautiful inside and out’.</p>
      <p>Adding to the family’s grief, Gina’s death is close to the anniversary of her sister, Leah’s aunty, who died by suicide five years ago.</p>
      <p>Leah said a history of mental health runs in the family and feels her mum, a grandmother of two, has been let down by authorities.</p>

      <p>She claims her parent, who suffered from schizoaffective disorder, begged to be sectioned for months before she was committed to Lakeside and at the height of her illness even asked police to shoot her.</p>
      <p>Leah said: ‘My mum was so clever. She had dreams of being a detective but unfortunately her mental health got the better of her. Every time she wanted to go back to college she got unwell.</p>
      <p>‘She always wanted to help people. She wanted to care for people who had mental health issues, that became her dream.</p>
      <p>‘She was brilliant but she was been left behind. I have been feeling suicidal over her death but I have lost trust in mental health services.’</p>
      <p>A cross-agency investigation into Ms Fletcher’s death is underway.</p>

      <p>The family’s loss is compounded by the struggle to afford a funeral, which cost on average £4,000.</p>

      <p>They have sent up a GoFundme page to raise some money to give their mum a proper send off, and say any little helps.</p>
      <p>Leah said: ‘We have hit rock bottom. We have already lost one relative who took her own life. Now we are left with the pressure of the funeral.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t want to ask for much. We are so grateful to everyone who has helped so far.</p>
      <p>‘Even if it’s just a donation of £1, it all adds up.</p>
