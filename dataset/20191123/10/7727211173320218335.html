      <h1>Success, destruction and a fight for survival at Birkenhead Market</h1>
      <h2>It still holds a special place in the heart of Wirral shoppers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:00:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/olivia-williams/" target="_blank">Olivia Williams</a></address>
      <p>A shopping market, once the hub of a Wirral town, has faced its fair share of trials and tribulations over the years - but it continues to fight on.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead Market</a> has a proud history in the town and we decided to take a look back at its golden era and what the future might hold.</p>
      <p>It's operated on a number of different sites in many different guises, but it's always held a special place in the heart of Wirral shoppers.</p>
      <p>The market was first established on what is now the site of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral-council">Birkenhead Town Hall</a> on July 10, 1835.</p>
      <p>As the town's population grew, increased demand led to the opening of an expanded market on a nearby site by 1845.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral-council">Wirral Council</a> paid £8,154 for the land of the extended market and £23,735 was spent on building what was Europe's second largest market.</p>
      <p>At the time, St John's in Liverpool city centre was actually the biggest in Europe.</p>
      <p>The market was constructed by Fox, Henderson &amp; Co and was constantly filled with shoppers grabbing their groceries and other bits of shopping.</p>
      <p>Michael Marks - one of the co-founders of supermarket chain, Marks &amp; Spencer - opened one of the first 'penny bazaar' stalls in the market in the 1880s.</p>
      <p>The market went from strength to strength in this golden era of shopping locally and supporting independent businesses, with archive photos showing what it looked like in its heyday.</p>
      <h3>Two fires strike the booming market</h3>

      <p>In 1969 the 129-year-old building was engulfed by a devastating fire, before being hit by tragedy again in 1974 when it was once more engulfed in flames.</p>
      <p>Traders lost thousands of pounds worth of stock - and the second fire wiped out goods bought in ready for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The commercial centre of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead</a> was redeveloped around the main shopping area of Grange Road.</p>
      <p>Following the two fires at the expanded market, the decision was taken to move it to a new premises adjoining the Grange Shopping Centre Precinct in 1977.</p>
      <p>In the 1990s the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Pyramids Shopping</a> centre opened and the previous market site was redeveloped along with the construction of two office buildings - the Land Registry and the Department of Work and Pensions offices.</p>

      <p>Over the last few years shoppers and traders alike have raised their concerns about the fortunes of Birkenhead Market, with perceptions it's struggling to stay relevant in a changing retail landscape.</p>
      <p>However, the market still has a lot to offer shoppers with butchers, fishmongers and stalls selling everything from clothes to books, toys and cosmetics.</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, when <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> visited Birkenhead Market we found the regulars were still loyal to his Wirral institution and the cafés were still popular with customers.</p>
      <p>But many feared Birkenhead’s love for its market – and a shopping experience where the shopowner knows your name – isn’t being passed on to a younger generation that has grown up shopping at retail parks.</p>
      <p>As cafe owner Ken Bibby put it: “I meet younger people who will say they have never been to Birkenhead Market”, while one beauty salon manager said: “Customers stop coming in because they think there’s nothing here”.</p>
      <h3>What does the future hold for Birkenhead Market?</h3>

      <p>Wirral Council took back control of the market in February in a bid to "secure its future" and have since released ambitious plans that could see the transformation of Birkenhead Market and the town as a whole.</p>
      <p>One idea is for a new <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead Market</a> on the site of the old M&amp;S store, as one of three options being considered for the famous market in a masterplan for the town centre takes place.</p>
      <p>A second option would see the market moved to where B&amp;M is now, while the third would involve building a new market on the current site.</p>

      <p>The Wirral Growth Company, a partnership between the council and urban regeneration specialists Muse Developments, put the latest ideas on display in a pop-up shop at the Pyramids during the latest round of a public consultation.</p>
      <p>The emerging masterplan includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Five phases spanning eight years</li>
        <li>The proposed demolition of Milton Pavement and a revitalised market in years one and two, plus an upgraded bus station and new civic and commercial offices</li>
        <li>Future years would include the demolition of the current market building - if it moves - a new leisure/commercial block and Grade A commercial office buildings</li>
        <li>Plans for new residential neighbourhoods to the north and south of Conway Park Station in later years, plus a hotel and a new leisure centre to replace Europa Pools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mike Horner, development director of Muse Developments, told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">the ECHO</a> : “This is round two of the consultation. We did the first round back in May and June</p>
      <p>“It’s all ideas at the moment. It’s a long term plan, it’s a very exciting vision for Birkenhead but it won’t happen overnight. These projects never do, but we want to have a plan to work to and we’re determined to get this right.</p>
      <p>“It’s important to get the feedback of people who live and work in the area.</p>
      <p>“This month we have been showing an emerging masterplan for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkenhead">Birkenhead town centre</a> and getting the views and thoughts of people through a number of events, the pop-up unit in the Pyramids and engaging with local people.</p>

      <p>“We have had sessions with market traders and we’re trying to get around and engage with as many key stakeholders as we can, getting their thoughts on what they like and don’t like.</p>
      <p>“When we collate the feedback, which we will do during the course of December, then early next year we’ll start to refine the masterplan on the back of that.</p>
      <p>“We‘ll then work with the council towards a planning application some time towards the summer of next year.”</p>
      <p>The latest update on the Wirral Growth Company’s website said of the market plans: “The first option is to move the market to the old Marks &amp; Spencer unit, which will ensure continuity of trade for stallholders and maintain its position at the heart of the town centre.</p>
      <p>“A second option is for the market to be housed in a new building on the site of the existing market.</p>
      <p>“The third option is for the market to be located on the existing site of B&amp;amp;M. Whichever option is chosen, it will re-vitalise the market and bring it back to being a place the Wirral community can be proud of and want to visit.”</p>
      <p>On plans for a new leisure centre, it said: “A modern and more energy-efficient leisure centre is proposed close to Conway Park station and existing homes to make sure it is sustainable. This would be delivered before any work on the existing leisure centre.”</p>
      <p>The Wirral Growth Company is a 10-year plan that began in March last year. Birkenhead town centre is one of the first projects, with others including schemes in Bebington, Bromborough and Moreton.</p>
      <p>Birkenhead Market traders’ chairman Greg McTigue, who runs Wirral Mobility, said: “We are watching the developments with interest and looking towards the day when we have a market which is fit for purpose, which of course the current one isn’t.</p>
      <p>“I like the M&amp;S idea because of the location, at the moment we are peripheral to everything.</p>
      <p>"It’s novel and people could come in on two levels, from the ground level and from the Pyramids. We have to look at what’s going to happen around it and whether there’s the square footage to contain the businesses.”</p>
      <p>The latest stage of the consultation will continue until the end of this month.</p>
