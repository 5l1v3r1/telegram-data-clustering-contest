      <p>Disaster management teams have been deployed by KZN Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC, Sipho Hlomuka, after the province was hit by yet another tornado, this time in Utrecht between Newcastle and Dundee on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The South African Weather Service reported that the tornado swept through the area after 7 pm, and although several houses have been damaged, no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>
      <p>“Our disaster management teams are on the ground providing relevant support to the affected families. This incident comes at a time when the province is mourning the loss of 23 lives due to weather-related incidents since October; this includes the tornado that struck New Hanover in the Midlands last week Tuesday,” Hlomuka said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Inclement weather conditions are expected to continue across the province, with the Weather Service issuing a warning for severe thunderstorms for large parts of the province on Saturday, bringing with it the possibility of strong wind, hail, and heavy downpours.</p>
