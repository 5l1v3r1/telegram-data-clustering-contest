      <p>Sultry actress, Rosaline Meurer, has said she is not in any relationship with any of her colleagues.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>Saturday Beats, </i>Meurer said, “Well, I would prefer a consideration of privacy on issues surrounding my intimate relationship. But regardless, I would say that I am not in any relationship with any of my colleagues and I’m not romantically attracted to any of my colleagues.”</p>
      <p>Meurer said she sometimes decides to keep quiet whenever she is being insulted on social media.</p>
      <p>She said, “I sometimes decide to keep mute; otherwise I try to make clarified reactions to dispose such negative narratives. We all know that no matter how best you try to please people, haters would always look for a reason to assert negative comments.”</p>
      <p>The actress, who featured in AY’s ‘Merry Men’, added that she was impressed with how far she had come in the industry.</p>
      <p>“Of course I am impressed and satisfied with my recent position in the industry. We are working tirelessly to ensure that we make progressive efforts to improve our impact and encourage creative developments in the movie industry.</p>
      <p>“Figuratively, my movies are been featured on international channels like Africa Magic and other renowned channels. So I would say I am quite satisfied because a lot of my colleagues in the industry may not have achieved this.”</p>
