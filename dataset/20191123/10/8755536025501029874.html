      <p>Kim Kardashian has finally addressed Caitlyn Jenner’s stint on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>The transgender star has been in the jungle for a week now, and many found it odd that her kids weren’t showing their support for her on social media.</p>
      <p>However, the 70-year-old’s former stepdaughter Kim has since shared a video of Caitlyn telling her campmates to “Rise and Shine” – poking fun at Kylie Jenner’s viral phrase.</p>
      <p>Kim tweeted the video from the show’s official ITV account, and wrote: “I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago.”</p>

      <p>Caitlyn’s stint in the I’m A Celeb jungle has gained her a lot of fans so far, and many viewers have been surprised by her down to earth nature.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the reality star <a href="http://goss.ie/la-showbiz/caitlyn-jenner-reveals-the-sweet-nickname-her-grandchildren-have-for-her-191486">revealed the sweet nickname her grandchildren have for her.</a></p>
      <p>And just last night, Caitlyn had <a href="http://goss.ie/featured/im-a-celeb-viewers-in-stitches-after-caitlyn-jenner-takes-a-tumble-191504">viewers in stitches after she awkwardly fell out of a window. </a></p>
