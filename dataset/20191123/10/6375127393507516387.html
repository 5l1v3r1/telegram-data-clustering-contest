      <h3>THE public is invited by Manila Mayor Isko Moreno to join him and ciy officials in the grand launching at 6 p.m. today of the newly-refurbished Jones Bridge in Binondo, Manila.</h3>
      <p>Moreno said the city government did not spend for the beautification of the said bridge and instead used the P20-million donated by a Filipino-Chinese organization for the purpose.</p>
      <p>The mayor notes how much the said historic 200-meter long bridge,  which spans over the Pasig River, speaks of the state of the city, specially since it connects P. Burgos Drive in Ermita to the areas of Escolta, Quintin Paredes and Chinatown, so that he embarked on its beautification.</p>
      <p>The Manila Chinatown, he said, is also being visited regularly by tourists as it is reputed to be the biggest in the whole world.</p>
      <p>It was learned from city engineer Armand Andres that among the notable features of the ‘new’ Jones Bridge are the installation of alternate 26 Reyna and 94 Princesa lampposts. A Reyna lamp post has five lights inside while Princesa has two.</p>
      <p>On orders of Moreno, engineer Andres said a vertical garden was also put up in the area complete with back-to-back pinlights while the metal girder was also equipped with accent lights.  Pinlights were also installed in the balusters or railings that have been painted gold.</p>
      <p>Andres said the refurbishment of the said bridge  took a record of only two months to finish and did not necessitate its closure to traffic, since it is busy with vehicular traffic on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Named after the United States legislator William Atkinson Jones, Jones Bridge was commissioned in 1919 and  replaced Puente de España (Bridge of Spain).</p>
      <p>Jones was the chairman of the U.S. Insular Affairs House Committee which used to exercise jurisdiction over the Philippines.  He was also the principal author of the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916 or ‘Jones Law’ which  gave the country legislative autonomy from the United States.</p>
