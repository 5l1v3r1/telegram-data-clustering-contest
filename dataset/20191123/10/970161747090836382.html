      <p>Jeffree Star has apologised after fans claimed they found ‘hairs’ in their Shane Dawson Conspiracy palettes.</p>
      <p>The YouTube beauty guru, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/jeffree-star-extra-34th-birthday-celebrates-shane-dawson-11167515/">who’s currently enjoying a birthday trip to Bora Bora</a>, took to social media to explain the situation.</p>
      <p>‘Hey everyone, it’s come to our attention that a few dozen people out of 1.1 million palettes produced, have a few ribbon fibers embedded in their products,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘The lab has done a full investigation &amp; we found the issue. I pride myself on quality and fully apologize for this error.’</p>

      <p>The 34-year-old attached a screenshot of an email, explaining that a few palettes contained ribbon fibres, and detailing the measures that will be taken in future, including eliminating the use of scissor-cut ribbon and using a black light to identify fibres.</p>
      <p>Jeffree has been praised for handling the situation quickly, with one fan saying: ‘Thank you for proving that it is NOT HARD to take part in quality control,’ and another adding: ‘THIS is how you handle an issue, take notes gurus.’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, some weren’t afraid to throw shade at Jaclyn Hill <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/25/jaclyn-hill-accused-whiny-excuses-returns-youtube-lipstick-scandal-10461291/">after she faced backlash for the quality of her makeup line</a>, with another fan adding: ‘Someone should tell jacklyn hill that this is how you apologise for s***.’</p>
      <p>Jeffree and Shane, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/01/inside-shane-dawson-and-jeffree-stars-controversies-from-blackface-to-james-charles-feud-10819032/">who have both faced controversies in the past</a>, also dropped the final episode of their series The Beautiful World Of Jeffree Star.</p>

      <p>After a break from the project, which saw Shane insisting he wanted to get the last episode exactly right, the hour and 20 minute video has been released.</p>
      <p>Despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/shane-dawson-accused-copping-shortening-jeffree-star-series-removing-james-charles-drama-11089804/">initial backlash, with some fans branding the series ‘nothing more than a huge promotion for your palette,’</a> and claiming that Shane shortenened it after promising nine episodes, the reaction has been largely positive.</p>
      <p>‘Feeling really emotional,’ the YouTuber tweeted. ‘Thank u guys for letting me spend the year making this series and the collection with @JeffreeStar and @AndrewSiwicki.</p>
      <p>‘This year has been so life changing in so many ways and I feel so grateful for every second of it. :’) thanks guys.’</p>
