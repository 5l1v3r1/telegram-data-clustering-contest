      <p>A housing association is warning tenants of a Universal Credit scam targeting benefit recipients that could leave you out of pocket.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plusdane.co.uk/">Plus Dane Housing</a> say fraudsters are targeting people who receive benefits but have not yet been moved on to Universal Credit.</p>
      <p>The scammers claim to offer people low-cost government loans and grants that don’t exist, taking their personal details and using them to 'apply for Universal Credit'.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/dwp-crack-down-universal-credit-16991360">Back in September</a> , the Department for Work and Pensions confirmed it was cracking down on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a> scam that sees vulnerable people become a target for fraudsters.</p>
      <p>But with Christmas fast approaching, the need for a little extra cash could see some falling victim to the offer of a fake government loan.</p>

      <p>Paul Moretta, head of income at <a href="https://www.plusdane.co.uk/">Plus Dane Housing</a> , said: "Fraudsters may ask for proof of your ID, your bank details and a fee, then use these details to make a false Universal Credit claim in your name.</p>
      <p>"They then request an advance payment and take the money. They might even use your details to commit other types of fraud afterwards.</p>
      <p>"If it happens to you, not only will your current benefits be stopped and replaced with Universal Credit - and you won’t be able to switch back - but you will also have to pay back the money the scammers took."</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>What is Universal Credit?</h3>
      <p>Universal Credit is a new benefits system that will eventually replace six seperate benefits.</p>
      <p>They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>income support</li>
        <li>income-based jobseeker's allowance</li>
        <li>income-related employment and support allowance</li>
        <li>housing benefit</li>
        <li>child tax credit</li>
        <li>working tax credit</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Claimants will get one single payment to cover any and all of these benefits they are entitled to.</p>
      <p>Out of that single payment they will then have to cover their own costs directly, e.g. rent, rather than it being a deducted payment.</p>
      <p>The brainchild of the Conservative Government, it is theoretically meant to make claiming benefits easier.</p>
      <p>But the policy has been bereft with problems since it started being rolled out across the country and has been blamed for pushing many vulnerable people into hardship and poverty.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>To keep yourself and your money safe from fraudsters, follow this advice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Never give money to anyone who calls unannounced at your home, approaches you in public, or who contacts you by phone, letter or email</li>
        <li>Never share personal information with anyone, even if they claim to be an official.</li>
        <li>Always ask to see identification. Don’t be afraid to double check this by calling any phone number on their ID, business card or paperwork. If they are genuine, they will not mind you taking the time to do this.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>It is a criminal offence to knowingly provide false information on a benefit claim. If somebody forces you to do this, it could affect the benefits you already receive, and you could be prosecuted.</li>
        <li>'Low-cost Government loans' do not exist. If you are in need of financial assistance and have been on benefits for longer than six months, you could apply for a Budgeting Loan (or Budgeting Advance in Universal Credit) – this has to be repaid.</li>
        <li>For more information and advice about Universal Credit, call the UC Helpline on 0800 328 5644 or contact your local Citizen's Advice Bureau. Plus Dane customers can contact their financial independence team.</li>
