      <p>Samsung Galaxy A51 Will Feature a 5MP Macro Camera<br/>3.3 (65%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>Samsung is currently working on a plethora of smartphones covering a lot of different segments. The brand is reportedly working on Galaxy S10 Lite, Galaxy Note 10 Lite, Galaxy A91 and of course, Galaxy A51. For the last couple of weeks, Samsung Galaxy A51 has been in the news for numerous leaks and rumors. Previously, the device <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/16/samsung-galaxy-a51-korean-certification-reveals-a-4000mah-battery/">appeared on the Korean certification</a> database. We now have yet another key information about the device.</p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy A51 to Come with a 5MP Macro Camera</h3>
      <p>This report is the courtesy of <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-a51-to-feature-a-5mp-macro-camera/">SamMobile</a>. We are already aware of the fact that the upcoming Galaxy A51 will feature a quad-camera module at the back. In fact, the device is going to be the company’s cheapest quad rear camera offering. As the name suggests, the device is going to be a true successor to the previously launched Galaxy A50. For those who’re unaware, the chaebol launched its first quad-camera smartphone last year with the moniker Galaxy A9 (2018). The Galaxy A9 (2018) features a wide-angle lens, ultra-wide-angle lens, depth sensor and a telephoto lens at the back.</p>
      <p>Unlike the A9 (2019), it seems like the upcoming Galaxy A51 will feature a 5MP macro lens as its fourth sensor instead of the telephoto. As per the report, the remaining three sensors are going to be a 48MP primary lens, 12MP ultrawide shooter and a 5MP depth sensor. Considering the fact that the device is going to be a cheaper quad-camera offering, the inclusion of a macro lens makes much more sense.</p>
      <h3>Specs, Features</h3>
      <p>Looking at the previous leaks and rumors, the Galaxy A51 will come with a 6.5-inch punch-hole display with a Full HD+ resolution. Similar to the Galaxy Note 10, the front selfie camera will be placed in the middle position. Under the hood, the device should run on the Exynos 9611 SoC paired with a 4GB of RAM and probably 128GB of storage. All of these are backed by a 4,000mAh battery packed inside. The device will run on the latest Android 10 operating system with One UI on top.</p>
