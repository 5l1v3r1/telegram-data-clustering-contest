      <p>“When I first met Serwaa Amihere, I was taken aback by her appearance. She had extremely long nails, noisy looking hair and skimpy clothes. I remember after my first interaction with her, she told me there was no way she could do away with her big hairdo and skimpy clothes, I then told her that she is not ready to be part of the news team.” Nana Aba recounted.</p>
      <p>Explaining how Serwaa Amihere finally made it into the media as an award winning presenter, Nana Aba said that; ” When I first met Serwaa I saw potential in her but I knew she needed direction, she needed someone to hold her hands and show her the right path to take….She had a horrible experience somewhere along the line which made her give up her skimpy clothes, long eyelashes, and loud hairdo. She was finally ready to learn and that’s how I coached her bit bit till she reached the level she is now.”</p>
      <p>When asked if she let’s Serwaa feel the pride she (Nana Aba) had for her, she responded saying: ” Serwaa is the type that easily gets carried away with compliments so even if she does well, I don’t compliment her often so that her head won’t swell up.”</p>
      <p>Nana Aba Anamoah has mentored and coached a lot of young men and women in the media to bring out the potential they have within. She is currently planning on going into teaching after she retires from the media.</p>
