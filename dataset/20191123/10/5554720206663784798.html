      <h1>Old tweets and video of PM Modi, his colleagues slamming NCP and Ajit Pawar surface on social media, embarrassed BJP functionaries start deleting old posts</h1>

      <p>Hours after the BJP pulled off a stunning political coup by forming a government with the help of Ajit Pawar of the NCP, the social media platform Twitter has been flooded with old tweets and videos of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party colleagues slamming the Nationalist Congress Party. Faced with embarrassment, some BJP functionaries have begun deleting old tweets targeting Ajit Pawar.</p>

      <p>In a tweet posted in 2014, Modi had termed the NCP a ‘naturally corrupt’ party adding that nothing had changed since the party came into existence. Addressing a rally in Pandharpur town in Maharashtra’s Solapur district after becoming the prime minister in October 2014, Modi had said, “NCP is naturally corrupt. Since the time the party was born nothing has changed, their leaders have remained the same. Do you know what their clock (party symbol) means? The clock shows 10 minutes to 10 which means in 10 years they have increased their corrupt activities 10 times.”</p>

      <p>More recently, Modi tweeted after addressing an election rally in Maharashtra in October, “Different places, same spirit, same vibrancy!<br/>Have a look at these pictures from today’s rallies in Akola and Jalna. The corruption of Congress and NCP continues to haunt. People are in no mood to vote for those who have misused public money. Maharashtra wants NDA again!’</p>

      <p>A tweet by BJP’s Maharashtra unit had read in April 2013, “Power Hungry Ajit Pawar must be sacked for derogatory remarks on plight of drought hit Maharashtra farmers.”</p>

      <p>Targeting Ajit Pawar, who took oath of office as Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis’ deputy, BJP’s social media head Amit Malviya had once written on Twitter, “Ajit Pawar in deep shit, no Pee actually ! Vernacular channels in Maharashtra have played up the story and people are furious..”</p>
      <hr/>

      <hr/>
      <p>Malviya’s party colleague Priti Gandhi had tweeted (now deleted) about Ajit Pawar, “Ajit Pawar didn’t pee enough so the dams didn’t fill up.” This was in response to Pawar’s infamous comments asking if he should urinate to fill the state’s dams.</p>

      <p>Fadnavis himself had once threatened to send Pawar, now his deputy, to jail in the Sinchan scam if voted to power. As expected, the video from 2013 has now gone viral on Twitter.</p>

      </figure>
      <hr/>
      <p>Another tweet by Fadnavis had read, ” BJP will never, never, never have alliance with BJP. Rumours are motivated. We exposed their corruption in assembly. Others were silent.”</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Today PM Modi was the first to congratulate Ajit Pawar for becoming a key member of his party’s government in Maharashtra. He wrote, “Congratulations to @Dev_Fadnavis Ji and @AjitPawarSpeaks Ji on taking oath as the CM and Deputy CM of Maharashtra respectively. I am confident they will work diligently for the bright future of Maharashtra.”</p>
      <p>Clearly, the BJP has redefined democracy in India where ideological consistency has zero meaning and doublespeak has become the new buzzword.</p>
