      <h1>Pakistan grapples with drug-resistant typhoid outbreak</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:27:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Early this year Muhammad Haider Sajjad, a thin bespectacled boy of 15, was hospitalised in Karachi, Pakistan’s commercial capital.</p>
      <p>Doctors suspected typhoid, but when the most common antibiotics failed to work, the boy’s family began to panic.</p>
      <p>Sajjad is one of more than 11,000 people, mostly children, to have contracted a drug-resistant strain of the infection in the country since 2016, and which experts say risks spreading internationally.</p>
      <p>He survived, but hundreds have died, predominantly in the southern province of Sindh.</p>
      <p>In response Pakistan’s government, already battling outbreaks of polio and dengue, has launched a huge foreign-funded vaccination drive that began on Nov 15.</p>
      <p>Some 3.4 million children have been vaccinated in the last four days in Karachi and the neighbouring city of Hyderabad where the outbreak was first reported, said James Fulker, a spokesman for GAVI, a Geneva-based partnership funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation that is administering the vaccine.</p>
      <p>Kept out of school for three months, Sajjad passed the time by tallying the daily rounds of shots given during his treatment - 84 in all.</p>
      <p>“I had not much to do during my illness. I used to keep count of injections I was being given,” he said.</p>
      <p>The latest strain is resistant to all but one antibiotic used to treat typhoid, a bacterial infection transmitted by human faeces.</p>
      <p>If it develops resistance to this final antibiotic treatment, disease experts say, death rates among those infected could rise dramatically to as much as 20%.</p>
      <p>HYGIENE CRISIS</p>
      <p>Sanitation is a major issue in Pakistan, especially in Karachi, a sprawling port city of more than 15 million on the Arabian Sea.</p>
      <p>Here, political infighting between two regional parties over refuse collection has seen huge mounds of garbage pile up in the street.</p>
      <p>Reuters visited several areas where the vaccine was being administered, predominantly in low income areas with poor quality, illegal housing.</p>
      <p>“Typhoid is a nightmare in countries like Pakistan because the hygienic situation is not good,” said Muhammad Khalid Shafi, a paediatrician and associate professor at Dow Medical College in Karachi.</p>
      <p>Resistance to immunisation programmes has hampered attempts to stamp out other diseases.</p>
      <p>In July, officials working on polio prevention told Reuters that parents suspicious of mass immunization campaigns have been getting hold of special markers, used by health workers to put a coloured spot on the little fingers of children who have been vaccinated.</p>
      <p>They said in some areas, as many as 8% of families may be refusing or avoiding vaccination, a level which would mean the disease is not eradicated.</p>
      <p>In several areas of Karachi, local mosques make announcements urging parents to get their children vaccinated against typhoid, especially in low-income neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p>The costs of refusing vaccination can be steep. The only antibiotic treatment to the latest strain of typhoid is expensive.</p>
      <p>Sajjad’s father, Syed Ahmed Jafer, estimates the cost of his treatment at 400,000 Pakistani rupees ($2,584) - a huge sum for almost any family in the country.</p>
      <p>“People should not be afraid of this campaign,” he said. “There is no cheap treatment, it cannot be ignored.”</p>
