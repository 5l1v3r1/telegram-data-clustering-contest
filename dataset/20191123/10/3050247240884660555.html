      <h1>‘Crypto is Unstoppable’ — Bitcoin Will Hit $100K, Says Cardano Founder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:29:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Ethereum (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>) co-founder turned Cardano (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cardano">ADA</a>) creator Charles Hoskinson said that he expects Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) to be back over $10,000 and reach $100,000 in the future.</p>
      <p>In a tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1197896099106828288">published</a> on Nov. 22, Hoskinson urged the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin is more than speculation, putting the blame on the latest drop in price on news media “FUD” — or fear, uncertainty and doubt — and market manipulation. </p>
      <h3>A global movement</h3>
      <p>Because there’s more to Bitcoin than just price movements, he expects the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to see more gains in the future. He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Bitcoin's price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that's going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Bitcoin’s recent price action</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/friday-shows-bloodbath-for-crypto-markets-bitcoin-price-at-7-300">reported</a>, Bitcoin and altcoins have seen a notable price decrease yesterday. More precisely, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $7,000 before settling slightly higher.</p>
      <p>Still, as Cointelegraph’s market analysis <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/after-testing-7k-is-bitcoin-price-finally-close-to-the-bottom">pointed out</a>, Bitcoin dominance is up for the week at 69%, meaning that BTC has once again outperformed other cryptocurrencies during the despite its decline this week.</p>
      <p>Shortly after the price drop, Bitcoin futures daily volumes on digital asset platform Bakkt have <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-set-new-daily-record-trading-over-20m">hit</a> a new all-time high, showing an increased interest in capitalizing on the renewed volatility.</p>
      <p>In October, Hoskinson also <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/if-bitcoin-fails-crypto-industry-in-for-a-bad-time-cardano-founder">expressed the idea</a> that if Bitcoin fails, the entire cryptocurrency industry could fail.</p>
