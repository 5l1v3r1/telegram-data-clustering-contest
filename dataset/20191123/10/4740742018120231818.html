      <h1>The new lost and found app for 50 million things lost each year is piloted in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>Now the police don't do this - the Found app will</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:29:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>A new ‘Lost and Found’ app that is trying to make it easier to reunite people with their lost stuff is being piloted in Bristol.</p>
      <p>It’s called, simply, ‘Found’, and is a mobile phone app and website that will give people the opportunity to post what they’ve lost, in the hope that someone has found it.</p>
      <p>And it will also give the opportunity for people to post stuff they’ve found, so that if anyone is looking for it, they can get it back.</p>
      <p>The app is launching with a city-wide treasure hunt today (Saturday, November 23), and those behind the tech start-up say they hope it will revolutionise the way we find things.</p>
      <p>The police no longer take on the role of collecting people’s lost property, so people who lose things are reliant on hoping the venue they’ve left something in will keep it, or someone will find it, post on social media and then be lucky enough to see it.</p>
      <p>The people behind ‘Found’ say it will be a simple and easy-to-use app that anyone can download and report lost and found stuff.</p>
      <p>“Over 50 million items are lost a year in the UK, with a value of over £1 billion,” said Found brainchild and CEO, Lance Plunkett.</p>
      <p>“Join this to the fact that police forces are no longer taking lost property at their stations, then you can see that there is a real need for a new innovative solution to this problem."</p>

      <p>The latest AI technology then matches lost and found items and links the finders and losers of property to arrange safe return. This makes Found the first lost property technology that services both the public and businesses.</p>
      <p>Mr Plunkett said that as the coverage of the Found network increases, so does the chance of finding the lost valuables which are registered on the app.</p>
      <p>“If your item is discovered, we’ll connect you with the person or organisation that found it, so that you can arrange to be reunited with your item,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In this respect we’re trying to create a community network that help each other, and promote social good,” he added.</p>
      <p>But what about stuff that is found, but not claimed?</p>

      <p>The company said it also has an altruistic plan for them too.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to be partnering with Bristol charities to stop unclaimed lost property going to landfill, the first of which we’re delighted to say is <a href="https://caringinbristol.co.uk/">Caring in Bristol</a>,” said chief operating officer Andrew Ogier.</p>
      <p>The start-up has the backing the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/west-of-england-combined-authority">West of England Combined Authority</a>’s inward investment arm Invest Bristol &amp; Bath, and Bristol Sport’s founder <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/stephen-lansdown">Stephen Lansdown</a>.</p>
      <p>They have made Bristol the first city to have access to the app, and that will be launched with a city-wide treasure hunt that everyone who downloads the app today can be part of.</p>
