      <h2>Ali Abdelaziz tweeted on Saturday morning claiming that the fight had been arranged and would take place in Saudi Arabia in January next year, but Mayweather is now "hiding"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:33:53+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov's manager Ali Abdelaziz claims that a fight between Khabib and Floyd Mayweather had been agreed for January 2020.</p>
      <p>Mayweather announced on Thursday that he will come out of retirement sometime next year, although the undefeated multiple world champion told <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/sports/floyd-mayweather-jr-retirement-ufc-dana-white">Reuters</a> on Tuesday that he was done with boxing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth,” Mayweather said.</p>
      <p>“Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.”</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old then uploaded a picture of himself to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> with tape around his hands and the words "Coming out of retirement in 2020.</p>

      <p>"@danawhite and I working together again to bring the world another spectacular event in 2020."</p>
      <p>UFC president White then backed up Mayweather's claim by reposting the image and adding three fist emojis.</p>
      <p>Mayweather hasn't competed since his 2017 victory over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> that took him to 50-0 in boxing, but he now seems set for a UFC debut in the New Year.</p>

      <p>There have been suggestions that could mean a rematch with McGregor, although this time in the octagon, but so far no opponent has been confirmed.</p>
      <p>However Abdelaziz appeared to confirm on Saturday that Khabib won't be that opponent.</p>
      <p>The Russian's manager posted a promotional video advertising a Mayweather vs Khabib bout which would take place in Saudi Arabia in January 2020.</p>

      <p>Alongside it he wrote: "This was originally planned but the big Dady of combat sport today <a href="https://twitter.com/danawhite">@danawhite</a> make <a href="https://twitter.com/FloydMayweather">@floydmayweather</a> hide for a lil bit.</p>
      <p>"3 of us knew what happened but to be honest I’m glad to see <a href="https://twitter.com/danawhite">@danawhite</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/FloydMayweather">@floydmayweather</a> finally got a good promoter to promote his fights."</p>
      <p>Khabib will fight Tony Ferguson in April or May.</p>
