      <h3>THE Department of Education (DepEd) said on Saturday that there is a proper forum to discuss and resolve issues between teachers and students after a Manila public school teacher was humiliated on the television program of Raffy Tulfo over child abuse.</h3>
      <p>Undersecretary and Spokesperson Annalyn Sevilla, in a Facebook post, cited clarifications and “points to ponder” on the recent case.</p>
      <p>Tulfo reaped the ire of netizens as he pressured a teacher, who was accused of humiliating a student, to willingly have her license revoked.</p>
      <p>In an episode entitled “Mommy, Ipina-Tulfo ang Pasaway na Teacher ng Kanyang Anak!” aired last Monday, November 18, the host acted on a complaint of a grandmother against the teacher of her grandchild for allegedly shaming and hurting the pupil.</p>
      <p>The child’s parents also appeared on the show where they repeatedly asked for justice thru the revocation of the teacher’s license to teach. The host agreed with the parents and even said that the child may suffer trauma.</p>
