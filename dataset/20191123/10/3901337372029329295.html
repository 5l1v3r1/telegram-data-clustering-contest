      <h1>Billiat &amp; Co. Disrupted In AFCON Campaign    </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:28:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs star Khama Billiat and his teammates from the Zimbabwe national team could finish their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign under a different coach. </p>
      <p>Following their impressive results in the last two matches, the Warriors are reportedly preparing to appoint a new coach, following the reported imminent exit of Joey Antipas.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Having taken charge of Zimbabwe in August on an interim basis, Antipas will see his contract expire at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Antipas, who doubles up as coach of Zimbabwean topflight club Chicken Inn, hasn’t heard anything regarding his future from the Zimbabwe Football Association as yet, according to reports. </p>
      <p>The former AmaZulu coach guided Zimbabwe to four points in their last two matches, following a 0-0 draw against Botswana and the 2-1 win over Zambia in the AFCON qualifiers.</p>
      <p>With a host of Zimbabwean players plying their trade in the PSL for different clubs in the Absa Premiership and GladAfrica Championship, there could be anxiousness in the coming days in anticipation of who the next coach will be for the Warriors, and for their chances to be selected for the national team again.      </p>
