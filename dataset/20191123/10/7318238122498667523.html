      <h1>U.S. military says unmanned drone lost over Libyan capital</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:06:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Helsel and Associated Press </a></address>
      <p>The U.S. military said late Friday that an unmanned drone was lost over the Libyan capital this week.</p>
      <p>The "remotely piloted aircraft" was lost over Tripoli on Thursday, U.S. Africa Command <a href="https://www.africom.mil/media-room/pressrelease/32380/rpa-lost-over-tripoli-incident-under-investigation">said in a brief statement</a>. The drone was not armed.</p>
      <p>The military said the incident remains under investigation, but noted that the drones are critical to counter-terror efforts in the country.</p>
      <p>The U.S. operations "are conducted in Libya to assess the ongoing security situation and monitor violent extremist activity," the statement said.</p>
      <p>The type of drone and more details about the aircraft lost were not disclosed.</p>
      <p>Rival groups <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/libyan-government-appeals-un-backing-after-confusing-message-trump-n1014471">have been fighting for control</a>of Tripoli for months.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, Libya has been divided between two governments, one based in Tripoli and the other in the country's east.</p>
      <p>World</p>
      <p>Forces loyal to the eastern government have been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-khalifa-hafta-whose-forces-are-attacking-tripoli-libya-n999421">trying to wrest control of the capital</a> since April.</p>
      <p>The North African nation has been divided and chaotic on becoming a failed state ever since NATO intervention, including American airstrikes, helped topple dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.</p>
      <p>Islamic extremists have been said to have taken advantage of the unstable situation.</p>
      <p>In September U.S. Africa Command carried out four airstrikes in the country, targeting what it said were "ISIS-Libya terrorists" — a name by which the Islamic State terror group is also known.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.africom.mil/media-room/pressrelease/32238/u-s-africa-command-airstrike-targets-isis-libya">most recent strike</a> was in southern Libya on Sept. 29, when it said 7 were killed.</p>
