      <p>Power has been restored after a brief emergency outage in Kokee this afternoon to allow crews to cut trees threatening power lines along Kokee Road.</p>
      <p>The emergency outage lasted from about 2:30 to 3:45 p.m. and affected about 200 customers in the area, a KIUC spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Crews took preemptive measures because the trees looked like they could pose a hazard due to the strong winds today, the spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Trimming of the trees also helps prevent an outage during the Kauai Old Time Gathering, a festival on Sunday in Kokee.</p>
