      <p>Christmas is going to be “a little dimmer” in one English village after the county council ruled that its festive lights are too heavy to be hung.</p>
      <p>Pembury will not be able to display its usual 8kg Christmas lights after Kent County Council said anything over 4kg would break health and safety rules.</p>
      <p>Tests earlier in the year found that many lampposts in the village would not support the weight, and the festivities will be restricted to garland lights on the village green.</p>
      <p>Councillor Louise Mills said: “Christmas is such a special time of year and I know Pembury residents appreciate the village lights.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, this year our High Street is going to look a little dimmer.</p>
      <p>“This is hugely disappointing, especially as the notice from Kent County Council was received so late in the day, giving us no time to rectify the situation.”</p>
      <p>A county council spokesman told The Sun: “We notified them that, following independent tests ordered by the parish council, only one column would be suitable for hanging decorations.”</p>
