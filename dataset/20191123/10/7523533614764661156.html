      <p>Welcome to our weekly property digest, where we bring together the best homes for rent and sale across the world. This week we discovered a frescoed French Riviera apartment in Nice and Will Alsop’s only known residential project in England’s West Sussex.</p>

      <p><b>4 bedrooms;<a href="https://thespaces.com/frescoed-french-riviera-apartment-lists-for-e1-38m/"> €1.38m via Espaces Atypiques</a> </b><br/>Gilded Age glamour comes alive inside Château D’Azur which was inspired by the 16th-century castle at Azay-le-Rideau in the Loire Valley. Traditional French and Italianate influences are combined with Art Deco features inside the 1932 building by Parisian architects Argentino and Gaujoin. The apartment has vibrant rooms with frescoes, paintings, marble and gilded mouldings. <a href="https://thespaces.com/frescoed-french-riviera-apartment-lists-for-e1-38m/">Get a closer look.</a></p>

      <p><b>3 bedrooms; <a href="https://thespaces.com/will-alsops-only-residential-project-is-for-sale/">£475,000 via The Modern House</a> </b><br/>British architect Will Alsop designed this 1960s bungalow in rural England and it is his only known residential project. Classic post-war British architecture leads into an extension where a playful transformation takes place. A barrel-vaulted aluminium ceiling is studded with Alsop’s signature porthole windows, crowns a modern living area and kitchen with exposed pine beams and steel. <a href="https://thespaces.com/will-alsops-only-residential-project-is-for-sale/">See more.</a></p>

      <p><b>Sleeps 2; <a href="https://thespaces.com/you-can-now-spend-the-night-with-the-royal-family-at-jaipurs-city-palace/">from €7,224 per night via Airbnb</a></b><br/>Airbnb’s first Royal host, Maharaja Sawai Padmanabh Singh, is welcoming guests into his ornate 300-year-old family home, the City Palace in Jaipur. The royal residence was built in 1727 for Jaipur’s founder Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II and is one of India’s most photographed buildings. The sprawling estate is a decadent example of Rajput architecture, with richly decorated rooms featuring vaulted ceilings, gilded wall decorations, crystal chandeliers and carved stone insets. <a href="https://thespaces.com/you-can-now-spend-the-night-with-the-royal-family-at-jaipurs-city-palace/">See more.</a></p>

      <p><b>3 bedrooms; <a href="https://thespaces.com/own-a-slice-of-1970s-italian-glamour-in-asti/">€390,000 via Fantastic Frank Italy</a> </b><br/>Villa Valmanera is a slice of 1970s Italian glamour. The time capsule bolthole is nestled into the hills of Italy’s Piedmont region, near Turin. It’s both elegant and restrained – and surprisingly modern with pea-green carpets, cork surfacing and a chrome-spindle spiral staircase that nods coolly to futurism. The Asti villa is surrounded by tall trees on a hectare of parkland.<a href="https://thespaces.com/own-a-slice-of-1970s-italian-glamour-in-asti/"> Get a closer look.</a></p>
