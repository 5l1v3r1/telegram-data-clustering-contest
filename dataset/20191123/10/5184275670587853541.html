      <p>While it was very clear from the start that Alia has been paired opposite Ram in the period drama, but the makers kept cine-goers waiting before revealing the name of leading lady opposite Jr.NTR.</p>
      <p>It was only last week when the makers announced that Jr.NTR has been paired opposite English theatre artist Olivia Morris.</p>
      <p>Whereas, Irish actors Alison Doody and Ray Stevenson will be playing lead antagonists in the magnum opus.</p>
      <p><b>70% Shoot</b> of the film has already been completed and the remaining part is expected to wrap in early 2020.</p>
      <p>RRR is a fictional story set in 1920s pre-independent era and it will be based on the lives of two real heroes and well-known revolutionaries — Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem.</p>
      <p>While Jr. NTR will be seen as Komaram Bheem, Ram Charan will be playing Alluri Sitharama Raju. The film also stars Bollywood superstar Ajay Devgn.</p>
      <p><i>RRR</i>  will release worldwide on July 30, 2020, in 10 Indian languages. Presented by D. Parvathy, the film is going to be produced under the DVV Entertainments banner by DVV Danayya.</p>
