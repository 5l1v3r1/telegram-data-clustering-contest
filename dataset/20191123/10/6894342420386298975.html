      <h1>OnePlus Security Systems Breached; Some User Information Compromised</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:38:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/heirul/" target="_blank">Heirul Kamel</a></address>
      <p>In a recent announcement on their official forums, OnePlus has revealed that its systems were breached and information about certain orders have been exposed by attackers. According to a security staff member, compromised information from the orders included names, contact numbers, emails, and shipping addresses.</p>
      <p>The breach was discovered when the security team was monitoring OnePlus’ systems and noticed that an unauthorized party was accessing some of their users’ order information. The team took immediate action to stop the intruder and reinforced security to make sure that no similar vulnerabilities were present.</p>

      <p>Prior to the announcement, the company has sent out emails to impacted users, notifying them of the breach. While on the other hand, OnePlus also confirmed that all payment information, passwords, and accounts are still secure, but warns affected users that they may receive spam and phishing emails as a result of this incident.</p>
      <p>The company also apologised for the breach and the inconveniences caused to its users, and will continue to further improve their security program. The staff member also mentioned in the announcement that OnePlus will be partnering with a world-renowned security platform next month but did not disclose its name – at least until an official statement is released by the company in the near future.</p>
