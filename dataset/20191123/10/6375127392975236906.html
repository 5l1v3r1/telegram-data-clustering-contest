      <h3>A liaison officer of the ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) was killed by government forces in an armed encounter the other day in Patikul, Sulu.</h3>
      <p>This was confirmed yesterday by Lt.Col.Gerald Monfort, spokesman of Joint Task Force (JTF) Sulu.</p>
      <p>Monfort identified the slain terrorist as Talha Jumsah alias “Abu Talha,” a high value target of the Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP) in Sulu.</p>
      <p>Record showed that Abu Talha is an ISIS-trained IED expert who served as an instructor to the ASG in the fabrication of a more lethal and destructive IEDs that caused tremendous casualties during the suicide bombings in Sulu.</p>
      <p>He also served as the finance conduit and liaison between foreign and local terrorist communication lines.</p>
      <p>Reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo showed that Abu Talha was killed at around 7:15 a.m. in an armed confrontation at Sitio Tubig Amu, Bgy. Tanum, Patikul,  Sulu.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, elements of 1st Scout Ranger Battalion went to the area in response to the information given by civilian communities regarding the presence of the terrorist in their village.</p>
      <p>Upon reaching the place, an armed confrontation occurred that resulted in the killing of the terrorist.</p>
      <p>Monfort said the cadaver of Abu Talha was recovered 800 meters away from the encounter site at around 8:30 a.m. yesterday morning by elements of 1101st Infantry Brigade during their clearing and follow-up operation.</p>
      <p>BGen Antonio Nafarrete, commander of 1101st Brigade, said the death of Abu Talha is a big loss to the ASG in their area.</p>
      <p>“The death of Abu Talha will surely cause demoralization in the ASG ranks in Sulu. It could not have been made possible without the support of the Tausug community which reported the presence of the armed terrorists and volunteered to serve as guides during the combat operations,” Nafarette said.</p>
      <p>For his part, Major General Corleto Vinluan Jr, Commander of the JTF Sulu lauded the operating units who carried out the combat operations to neutralize Abu Talha.</p>
