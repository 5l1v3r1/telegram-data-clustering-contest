      <p>We were the first to bring you the story about how<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/chehre-kriti-kharbanda-asked-to-exit-amitabh-bachchan-and-emraan-hashmi-s-film-due-to-her-starry-tantrums/5dd2147287fb571eff7e3fd4"> Kriti Kharbanda walked out of Amitabh Bachchan and Emraan Hashmi starrer Chehre</a><a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/kriti-kharbanda-did-not-want-to-kiss-and-seduce-in-chehre-quit-the-film-on-a-very-discomforting-note-exclusive/5dd3d9ac87fb571eff7e4190"> </a>after shooting for 2 days. Next, we brought you a list of tentative names which included <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/after-kriti-kharbanda-s-no-to-the-kiss-in-chehre-elnaaz-nourozi-in-the-fray-exclusive/5dd3e12c87fb571eff7e41aa">Elnaaz Nourouzi, Mouni Roy, Ankita Lokhande and Krystle Dsouza.<br/></a><br/>Ultimately,<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/mouni-roy-says-no-to-amitabh-bachchan-starrer-chehre-and-krystle-dsouza-bags-it-exclusive/5dd6bc950cada251e9c31085"> Krystle bagged the role with open arms.</a> Now, we have heard that amidst all the names that were in the running to bag the role of the female lead, Yami Gautam was also being considered.<br/><br/>Talks were on and the makers were hotly considering the pretty actress who’s been riding high on the success of her films like URI and Bala. However, Yami’s choc-a-bloc work schedule didn’t allow her to allot dates to the makers almost immediately.</p>

      <p>With Kriti marking an exit, director Rumi Jaffery and producer Anand Pandit wanted an actress who could kick-start working on the film ASAP, but a source reveals that Yami’s date issues didn’t permit her to go ahead with the project. Despite a text message, Yami remained unavailable for comment.</p>

      <p>The makers didn’t want to delay as it would have only increased the budget of the film. So finally, Krystle Dsouza was locked in for the part. Speaking of why Kriti Kharbanda marked an exit- we had brought <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/kriti-kharbanda-did-not-want-to-kiss-and-seduce-in-chehre-quit-the-film-on-a-very-discomforting-note-exclusive/5dd3d9ac87fb571eff7e4190">you the exclusive report about how the actress wasn’t comfortable doing an intimate scene</a> and indulging in liplock. The makers and the actress couldn’t come to a conclusion and finally, Kriti decided it was best to part ways.</p>
