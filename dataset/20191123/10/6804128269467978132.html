      <h1>Frank Lampard explains his Chelsea fines policy and the Blues player who approved it</h1>
      <h2>Players can be fined £20,000 if they are late for training</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:30:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Harbord</a></address>
      <p>Frank Lampard doesn't believe the fine policy for his Chelsea players is harsh and even got Cesar Azpilicueta to sign off on it before it was approved.</p>
      <p>The list of different fines that players can receive for breaking club policy was leaked during the week, with one of the eye-watering figures being £20,000 if someone was late for training.</p>
      <p>While Lampard would surely not have liked that the fines were leaked, what it did show that he is definitely ready to manage with an iron fist to keep control of his team if needed.</p>
      <p>The fines seemed to be pretty high numbers for many looking at them, however Lampard has defended the policy and even stated that Cesar Azpilicueta got to sign off on them before they we published.</p>
      <p>"I can understand it might sound harsh. It’s not harsh if you’re not late. It’s nothing. That’s one thing," Lampard explained.</p>
      <p>"I think we put in the discipline for one reason. My only concern when that came out was it makes me look like trying to be Mr Tough Guy.</p>
      <p>"I’m not. We spoke with the players and I gave the list to Azpilicueta when we set out the fines.</p>

      <p>"In fact I was asking him if there were any areas you see because I wanted to know what happened last year, whether the players were happy, were they not.</p>
      <p>"That came into the picture as well so it’s certainly a bit of a joint effort. Maybe the numbers were chosen by myself to a degree.</p>
      <p>"I do think discipline is an important thing and I'm very happy to work with the players. I want to be successful.</p>
      <p>"I expect them to look after each other on the pitch and when they train, so I expect them to respect each other in terms of turning up.</p>
      <p>"If you talk about coming late to training, we arrive at 10 and we start training at 11. If you’re late for training you’re like an hour and 15 minutes late without any excuse, that’s quite a big deal if you’re preparing for a game against Man City on the next day.</p>
      <p>"I know the fines are relative, people can have their own mind. But the players are certainly big in the setting up of that and I think it’s important to have discipline in the workplace.</p>
      <p>"They [the players] were part of the process. I’m not here to be a dictator and make things difficult. We’re here to be successful as a football club and discipline’s part of it and I worked with them in putting it together."</p>
      <p>Lampard confirmed that Chelsea's player liaison officer is the enforcer of the fines, while any money earned from it will go to charity.</p>
      <p>"The fine money goes to charities and it said on the form about having certain team get togethers," Lampard added.</p>
      <p>"We haven’t had any of those. Predominantly it will go to charities of our choice. I don’t mind as long as it’s good causes."</p>
