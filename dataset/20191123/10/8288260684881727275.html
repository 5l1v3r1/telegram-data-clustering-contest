      <p>John McGinn is already adored by <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> fans.</p>
      <p>His talent on the pitch, goals, assists and performances in the Premier League have all endeared himself to the Villa Park faithful.</p>
      <p>The Scot clearly has a sense of humour, as well, with a number of clips from social media bringing a smile to fans’ faces.</p>
      <p>And he’s done it again with a witty response to team-mate <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/ahmed-elmohamady">Ahmed Elmohamady</a> after the Egyptian tweeted a post in his native language.</p>
      <p>While the message wouldn’t have made much sense to most UK readers – <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">McGinn</a> “won the internet” with his reply.</p>
