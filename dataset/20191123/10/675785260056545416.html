      <h1>Date you're allowed to put up Christmas decorations according to mums</h1>
      <h2>To early and you're 'vulgar' or 'tacky', too late and you're a Grinch - so what's the actual date the decorations should go up to avoid the wrath of the nation's mums?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>With Haloween and bonfire night behind us, this weekend Christmas decorations will be going up in homes up and down the land.</p>
      <p>And mums are livid about it.</p>
      <p>When one Mumsnet user suggested 25th November was a perfectly reasonable time to put the tree up, she was roundly attacked.</p>
      <p>One of the kinder posters argued: “Way way to early. December 1st at the earliest.”</p>
      <p>In fact, some people felt so strongly about it they said we needed to change the law.</p>
      <p>“NOT before December 1st. We need laws. Including the death penalty for shops who put xmas stuff out in September,” one poster wrote.</p>
      <p>Others thought Mid-December was right.</p>

      <p>One wrote: “25th November is insanely early too! 15th December is the earliest it should go up. Down on the 6th January.”</p>
      <p>While a traditionalist suggested waiting until the very last day.</p>
      <p>“Trees up this early is so tacky! Don’t do it. Christmas Eve to Twelfth Night. Anything else is a bit vulgar really,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>But as well as risking the wrath of mums online, there's another reason to stay your hand when it comes to Christmas lights.</p>
      <p>“It’s also massively wasteful of energy resources, so unless they’re being solar-powered, they are harming the rest of us,” another poster wrote.</p>
      <p>Just how much will it cost you?</p>
      <p>Well, running seven strings of 100 incandescent Christmas lights for six hours a day will costs £9 for the month of December, <a href="https://www.loveenergysavings.com/">Love Energy Savings</a> worked out.</p>
      <p>Overall, the average UK household spends £50 more on energy bills over December, the organisation added.</p>
      <p>Love Energy Savings' Phil Foster said: “It’s incredible the amount of energy which is consumed over the Christmas period in general, but getting your decorations out early can only lead to inflated electricity bills for longer periods.</p>
      <p>“While it might seem like a nice idea to start celebrating early, I would advise people to consider the costs before they start decorating.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Alternatively, try and do some research into energy-saving LED lights to reduce energy consumption and ensure that lights are switched off when they’re not needed.”</p>
