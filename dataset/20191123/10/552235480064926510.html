      <p>Charlie Adam has admitted leaving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> left him in tears after he decided to leave the club for more first team football.</p>

      <p>"I knew to be in any way satisfied I had to play football. But it was a tough thing to go.</p>
      <p>"It broke my heart. Yeah, it broke my heart. I sat and cried."</p>
