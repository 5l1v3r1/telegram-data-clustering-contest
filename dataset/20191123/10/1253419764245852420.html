      <h1>Here are the minimum PC requirements for running Half-Life: Alyx</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:21:56+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:21</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Valve has revealed the official minimum PC requirements for its next Half-Life game, Half-Life: Alyx. According to the specs, PC gamers will at least need an Intel Core i5-7500 or an AMD Ryzen 5 1600 with 12GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>Valve also lists the NVIDIA GeForce GTX1060 and the AMD Radeon RX580 as the game’s minimum GPU requirements. Unfortunately, there is no word on whether the game will support a low-level API like DirectX 12 or Vulkan.</p>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx is set in the 20 year time gap between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. The game will be using Source 2 Engine and will feature a single-player, story-driven linear FPS campaign. The game will also heavily utilize physics and will include a physical player body.</p>
      <p>Half Life Alyx will come out in March 2020 and, as Valve has <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/valve-explains-why-half-life-alyx-is-not-half-life-3-and-why-there-wont-be-a-non-vr-mouse-keyboard-version/">explained</a>, it will be playable only on VR devices.</p>
