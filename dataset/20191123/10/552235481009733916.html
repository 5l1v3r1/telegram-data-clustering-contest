      <p>A young football coach who was involved in a scheme to keep kids out of trouble has been exposed as a cocaine dealer.</p>
      <p>Shaun Grady, who worked with Renfrewshire’s Street Stuff programme, was nabbed in a car with almost £1,000 worth of the Class-A powder, two mobile phones and a glove box stuffed with bank notes.</p>
      <p>Trainee quantity surveyor Grady, of Knowe Road, Paisley, was stopped by cops in Maxwellton Road in the town before the drugs haul and cash were discovered.</p>
      <p>The details emerged when Grady, 22, appeared in the dock at Paisley Sheriff Court, where he pled guilty to a charge of being concerned in the supply of cocaine.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Keri Marshall told the court Grady was caught on December 6 last year.</p>
      <p>She explained: “Grady directed police witnesses to his left trouser pocket and three bags were recovered.</p>
      <p>“The car was searched and, again, Grady directed police to two blue bags on the rear seat of the car.”</p>
      <p>One of the bags contained 16.5g of cocaine, while other bags were found to contain 0.67g, 0.77g and 0.4g of the drug.</p>
      <p>Officers also found £170 in cash in the centre console of the vehicle, a further £430 in mixed notes in the glove box, and two mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Miss Marshall told Sheriff David Pender that officers also found digital scales, unused polythene bags and a small toffee hammer.</p>
      <p>The total value of Grady’s drugs haul was around £920.</p>
      <p>Grady was taken to the police station to be interviewed and insisted the cocaine he had in his trouser pocket was for his own personal use.</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Marisa Borland explained: “He lives with his gran.</p>
      <p>“He helps her with day-to-day tasks, but there are other people available.</p>
      <p>“He is a trainee quantity surveyor and attends Glasgow Caledonian University part-time, on a Friday, to get his qualification for that.</p>
      <p>“He has completed one full year and has four years left on that, on a part-time basis, funded by his employer.</p>
      <p>“He has responsibility for the coaching of a youth football team and plays football at weekends.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff David Pender said: “I’m told you have no previous convictions and, of course, I accept that, but this is a serious matter.”</p>
      <p>He then called for background reports to be prepared ahead of sentencing, adjourned the case until next month for that to be done, and released Grady on bail.</p>
      <p>Street Stuff is a partnership programme run by Renfrewshire Council, St Mirren Football Club, Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue and Engage Renfrewshire.</p>
      <p>The scheme offers free activities to young people throughout Renfrewshire in a bid to tackle youth disorder and antisocial behaviour.</p>
      <p>A Renfrewshire Council spokesman said: “All Street Stuff coaches and volunteers go through a rigorous recruitment process by St Mirren Football Club, which includes a Disclosure Scotland and PVG check, as part of the requirement for the role.</p>
      <p>“The well-being of young people is of paramount importance and the council works closely with the club to take all the necessary steps to ensure that everyone who works with the programme is professional at all times.</p>
      <p>“The coach is no longer with the programme.”</p>
