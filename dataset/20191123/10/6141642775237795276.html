      <p>A dog who got locked inside his owner’s car stuck it in reverse and rode in circles for an hour.</p>
      <p>Police in Port St Lucie, Florida, said the owner stepped out of the car after making a wrong turn on to Edith Court.</p>
      <p>Max, a black labrador, then accidentally put the car in reverse, causing it to circle the cul-de-sac for an hour, hitting a postbox and taking out a rubbish bin.</p>
