      <p><a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/trippie-redd-returns-with-a-love-letter-to-you-4-ft-dababy-tory-lanez-juice-wrld-and-more-new-mixtape.119804.html">Trippie Redd's new album <i>A Love Letter To You 4</i> was released yesterday and, so far, fans are loving what they're hearing</a>. Despite a fairly-long tracklist, each track seems to be eliciting new emotions for the Ohio rapper's supporters. Filled to the brim with features from high-profile artists, Trips enlisted YoungBoy Never Broke Again for "Hate Me," a song that originally leaked a couple of months ago. This isn't the first time that the two artists have linked up in the studio, previously collaborating on a couple of other joints. Appearing right in the middle of the 21-track playlist, "Hate Me" gets the spotlight treatment here.</p>
      <p>These two stars have clear chemistry, bouncing ideas off one another in a freestyle format, jumping together on the hook and relying on one another to level up individually. The instrumental contains a cloud-headed beat loop that, by itself, could be described as trippy. Trippie and YoungBoy offer structure to the music, rhyming delightfully over the two-and-a-half-minute joint.</p>
      <p>Let us know if you're feeling this new song from two of the hottest young rap prospects. <a href="https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/stream-trippie-redds-a-love-letter-to-you-4-with-nba-youngboy-ynw-melly-and-more-news.96295.html">Listen to <i>A Love Letter To You 4</i> here</a>.</p>

      <p>Ice tray, diamonds on froze, get a migraine<br/>Life on the edge, live it up on the high lane<br/>Me and Trippie Redd back to back on the same thing<br/>Late night, turnt in the club doing my thing<br/>Sip drank, get a cup, I'ma pour the whole thing<br/>Shawty playin' games, she don't wanna sell her soul, man</p>
