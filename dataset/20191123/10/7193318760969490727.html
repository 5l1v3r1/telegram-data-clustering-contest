        <b>I’m excited for the free streetcar weekend starting today through the end of the year. How is this being funded? Any talk about making this permanent? Would a corporate sponsor with naming rights be a possibility, has this been considered?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The OKC Streetcar is offering free weekend rides (Fri., Sat., Sun.) from Nov. 22-Jan. 5 as part of its participation in the Downtown In December program and a way to support the businesses and destinations along the loops. EMBARK is working with Houck Transit Advertising to secure sponsorships to support the ongoing operation of the Streetcar. Currently there are 20 platform sponsors. An overall naming-rights sponsor is an option that is being pursued. EMBARK’s Board of Trustees sets fares. Permanent free transit services would be a policy change and would include dialogue between EMBARK’s Board of Trustees, City Hall, and City Council.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Any idea when the Streetcar stops will be completed? They all have the temporary yellow construction netting where vertical rails should be. They've been an eyesore since the Streetcar opened a year ago.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Michael Scroggins with EMBARK, the MAPS office just reported that the contract would go before Council in December. Work should start in early February and wrap-up by early June.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you know how much, if any, success Leadership Square has had in leasing the space previously occupied by Enable?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mark Beffort, co-owner, reports one of the six floors previously leased by Enable has been leased with deals working for another three of those floors. The rest of Leadership Square is fully leased.</p>
      <p>Built in 1984, Leadership Square is still one of downtown's most desirable (if not the most desirable) properties thanks to its design, public space and amenities, and ongoing investment in keeping the building up to Class A standards.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is Devon currently paying a lease to the BOK Park Plaza building? I recall they had originally intended to occupy space but don't know if they signed a lease and are currently trying to sublet or not.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That's the big question. They did a deal when they were growing at a rapid pace to lease 250,000 square feet of the tower — space they've never occupied as the industry changed and the workforce was reduced through a series of layoffs.</p>
      <p>I've asked previously whether BOK leased space from the building owner, Hines, or whether the company leased part of the Devon space. I never got an answer. I suspect BOK leased from Hines as that deal was part of the overall plan for building the tower.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Whats next in the Plaza District?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jeff and Aimee Struble are converting a duplex into an Air BnB and their social media has posted that their restaurant, Aurora, is about to reopen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hypothetically, if MAPS 4 doesn't get passed, what steps can the council take to reintroduce these projects? Is the 1 cent sales tax still the best option for doing these large capital projects?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If MAPS 4 fails, I suspect that will be the end of the MAPS brand. You would have trouble getting a campaign funded for just the social service issues, and some of the other issues would struggle as well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>There has been a lot more activity happening in the Ironworks area (west of Western, south of Linwood Blvd.) What do you foresee happening in this area?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We're first going to see a split in the naming of this area, with the east half ending up as the "Sunshine District" while the west part will remain known as the 'Ironworks District."</p>
      <p>I find it a bit crazy, but also reflective of the area's momentum, that such a split on branding is already occurring for this area that only a few years ago was considered a long ways off before being viable.</p>
      <p>Go figure.</p>
      <p>I also believe what happens next with the old Nuway Laundry complex at NW 6 and Western will give us a big indicator of how quickly this area is set to develop.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The function of Starbucks on 23rd Street = Good. The design of Stabucks on 23rd Street = Bad. I urge the developer to rethink their drive thru layout.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The developer, Ryan McNeill, has included several site layouts he looked at before coming to the one being proposed.</p>
      <p>I spoke to Ryan, and he's indicating he will be visiting with neighbors and taking community feedback into consideration before moving forward.</p>
      <p>Now is the time for all concerned to look at the site and suggest ideas on how to make this property less suburban in design. It does seem to have a lot of parking. I suspect the answer lies in reconciling the location of the drive-thru lane with the opportunity to create an extended street-front patio extending the built presence facing NW 23.</p>
