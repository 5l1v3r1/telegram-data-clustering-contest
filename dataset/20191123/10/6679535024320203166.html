      <h2>Traders seek regular patrolling on the service lane</h2>

      <p>Mounds of garbage can be found dumped along the service lane of the 32-km-long Chennai Bypass, especially near Porur toll-plaza. Construction debris and wet waste from meat shops are also part of these heaps. “The service lane near the toll-plaza is stench-ridden. At times, the garbage overflows on to the carriageway,” says K. Vinoth, a resident of Porur. Traders near the toll-plaza say much of the dumping happens at night. As there is no regular patrolling along the service lane, people find it convenient to discard waste, say traders.</p>
      <p>The bypass comes under the purview of National Highways Authority of India. It witnesses heavy traffic as it connects four national highways: Chennai – Tirupati, Chennai-Bangalore, Chennai-Tada and Chennai-Tiruchi.</p>
      <p>“Necessary measures will be taken to put an end to this practice,” says an NHAI official.</p>
