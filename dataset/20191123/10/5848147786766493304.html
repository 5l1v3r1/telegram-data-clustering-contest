      <h1>Aussie Home Loans ads misleading: CHOICE</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:01:31+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/colin-brinsden/" target="_blank">Colin Brinsden</a></address>
      <p>Consumer advocate CHOICE believes mortgage broker Aussie Home Loans is engaged in “misleading and deceptive” advertising and has complained to the regulator.</p>
      <p>CHOICE says Aussie Home Loans makes claims of finding Australians the ‘perfect loan’ or the ‘best loan, yet research shows two in five loans are sent to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the broker’s owner.</p>
      <p>“Aussie Home Loans is a well-disguised sales outpost of the Commonwealth Bank,” CHOICE CEO Alan Kirkland said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“Aussie is making big promises to create the illusion that it operates in your best interests but there is no evidence that they will get you the ‘best’ loan.”</p>

      <p>Choice has complained to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, asking the regulator to investigate Aussie’s claims and hold them to account.</p>
      <p>More broadly, CHOICE is calling on all federal politicians to support the passage of the mortgage broker best interests duty, laws which it expects to be introduced into parliament this year.</p>
      <p>Mr Kirkland says this is an important response to the Hayne Royal Commission recommendations.</p>
      <p>“Treasurer Josh Frydneberg has created a rare opportunity to reform the mortgage broker industry,” he says.</p>
      <p>“A strong best interests duty, well enforced, will make brokers live up to the promises they already make to their customers.”</p>
