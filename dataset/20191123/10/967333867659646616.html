      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gabyassuncao02/">19-year-old Brazilian Instagrammer and influencer Gabriela Sara Vasconcelos Assunção</a> has been put into custody after it appeared she posed for multiple pictures, including a number of highly-sexualised ones, with a variety of guns, Brazilian news site Metropoles <a href="https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/modelo-que-tirava-fotos-com-fuzis-e-presa-a-caminho-de-casamento">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She faces arms trafficking charges, a little over a month after she and her boyfriend were stopped as they were travelling in a car stuffed with rifles and bullets.</p>
      <p>At the time, the police spotted 10 nine-mm calibre pistols, a 223 calibre rifle and 484 nine-mm calibre bullets all hidden in the trunk, with Assunção claiming she had no idea the vehicle was packed with the guns.</p>
      <p>Although detained at the time of the discovery, the pair were later released after a hearing.</p>
      <blockquote>Investigators, however, proceeded with their work, ploughing through the girl’s piles of pictures and videos uploaded on Instagram, before finding multiple suspicious items featuring the objects from the exposed cache.</blockquote>
      <p>In one of them, a selfie, the heavily tattooed model poses topless holding up a gun with her finger resting on the trigger. Another saucy snapshot sports a kiss with a pistol, with the girl’s ducked-out lips touching the barrel of the gun.</p>
