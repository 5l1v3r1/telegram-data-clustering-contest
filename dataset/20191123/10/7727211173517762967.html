      <p>A sprawling family home has come <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/property">on the market</a> in Merseyside - and it's got a very exciting feature tucked away in the back garden.</p>
      <p>The six-bedroom property is nestled down a private drive on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Caldy Road in Caldy</a> , in one of the most affluent areas of the Wirral peninsula.</p>
      <p>On the market with Bradshaw Farnham &amp; Lea, this plush property carries a hefty price tag of £1,395,000 - but photos taken inside show just how much you get for your money.</p>
      <p>A listing uploaded to Rightmove shows the high-end features and impressive interior design scheme that make this property so spectacular.</p>

      <p>Approached by a huge private driveway and set within stunning landscaped gardens, the house enjoys considerable privacy from the road outside.</p>
      <p>Named 'Beechwood', the property has undergone extensive renovation work and despite the classical frontage the interior is decidedly modern.</p>
      <p>Stepping through the archway at the front of the property, the home opens out onto an entrance hallway with a separate cloakroom.</p>
