      <p>Left-sided defender Golbourne, 31, first came across Ebanks-Landell at Wolves when the latter was just 20 after coming through the ranks at Molineux.</p>
      <p>They played a handful of games together in the Kenny Jackett-led side that stormed to the League One title in 2013/14 – with Sam Ricketts also in the back four – and then went into the second tier.</p>
      <p>Golbourne feels Ebanks-Landell, who is 27 next month, has all the attributes to thrive and thinks settling down at Shrewsbury has been key.</p>
      <p>“The guy has got huge potential,” Golbourne said of Ebanks-Landell. “I saw him as a younger professional coming through at Wolves.</p>
      <p>“He’s got all the tools for your modern-day centre-half, he can do all of it.</p>
      <p>“He’s still got the ability to win headers, he’s a real physical threat in the air. But he’s very good on the ground with his feet.</p>
      <p>“The guy can move as well, he’s started to get a very good understanding of the game.</p>
      <p>“He’s becoming a more experienced defender, you can see that in the way he’s playing, he’s a lot more efficient in what he’s doing. He’s starting to really show his quality. He did it at Sheffield United when he had a good run of games and showed his quality.</p>
      <p>“No doubt it will be the same for him this season.”</p>
      <p>A spell out with a hamstring injury aside, Ebanks-Landell has caught the eye as a regular under Ricketts since arriving from Wolves in the summer.</p>
      <p>He had mixed reviews from two previous loans at MK Dons and Rochdale.</p>
      <p>“I think he needed the fresh start. He needed a permanent base. It’s always difficult on loan when it’s not your main football residence,” Golbourne said.</p>
      <p>“It’s good he’s come somewhere and committed to something, he can really crack on because he has huge potential and he’s starting to fulfil that and people are seeing it regularly.”</p>
