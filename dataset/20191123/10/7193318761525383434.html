    <meta property="og:description" content="OK rig count holds Oklahoma’s rig count remained unchanged this week as the nationwide number of working rigs declined, Baker Hughes reported Friday. This week's national working rig count is 803, off three for the week and off 276 from the 1,079 that were drilling a year ago. In Oklahoma, the count remained at 52, compared to 144 a year ago. The number of rigs working in the Cana Woodford basin declined by one week-over-week, to 27. The most active basins this week, Baker Hughes said, are the Permian in west Texas and southeast New Mexico at 405, the south Texas Eagle Ford at 60, the Haynesville at 53, the Williston at 51 and the Marcellus at 36."/>
