      <p>Omega Investments has made its name investing in tired, old houses and breathing new life into them, for rent and for sale, specializing in stately homes and mansions that simply never deserved to become distressed.</p>
      <p>With McKinley Row, its just completed pocket of four new homes, Omega is demonstrating homebuilding chops born of a decade of custom renovations. The investment also shows the commitment of Scarlet Le-Cao, executive director, and her husband, Nathan, owners, to a healthy and thriving urban core. Omega Investments' subsidiaries are Modern Touch by Omega, Omega Houses, OmegaBnb and La Bella Event Center.</p>
      <p>McKinley Row, Omega's first venture into new construction, has been nominated for recognition by Urban Land Institute Oklahoma as a boutique development.</p>
      <p>The Vietnamese immigrants and Oklahoma college grads (Oklahoma State for her, the University of Oklahoma for him) have left their mark on historic properties in Lincoln Terrace, Mesta Park, Jefferson Park and Military Park, among other mature neighborhoods. Omega also has long-term rentals in Oklahoma City, Midwest City, Del City and Moore. Last year, Omega branched into event centers.</p>
      <p>McKinley Row is theirs from start to finish to handing over the keys. Modern Touch by Omega, the company's development arm, built McKinley Row to designs by Common Works Architects.</p>
      <p>The homes are in the 2800 block of N McKinley Avenue just north of NW 23, just off Classen Boulevard, a stroll from the Asian District and Oklahoma City University.</p>
      <p>"We would love to see young professionals come and live in the Asian District. We have supermarkets, restaurants, coffee shops, parks and pharmacies within walking distance," Nathan Cao said.</p>
      <p>McKinley Row homes were "inspired by roots in the Asian District and vision for continued growth and development of the urban core," said Jennifer Kragh, who has them listed with Sage Sotheby's International Realty, 6340 N Western Ave.</p>
      <p>Sotheby's is known for marketing luxury properties. But McKinley Row homes are affordable, with 2800 N McKinley, nicknamed Jasper — three bedrooms, three baths, 1,505 square feet — listed for $299,900.</p>
      <p>"Each home is sleek, efficiently planned and bursting with personality," Kragh said. "Jasper is the anchor of the Row on the corner. With blue accents of penny tile and cabinetry, along with classic steel gray accents, Jasper strikes a perfect balance of refinement with pops of pizzazz. The downstairs master has a soaring ceiling, outdoor access and en-suite bath. Upstairs are two more beds and a full bath. (Enjoy) outdoor living on the roof-top patio with State Capitol views."</p>
      <p>Cao called the Asian District "arguably the most matured district in terms of amenities" in the urban core.</p>
      <p>He wondered "Wouldn't it be great to see people practicing tai chi in Military Park?"</p>
