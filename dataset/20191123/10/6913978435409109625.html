      <p>NEW YORK — Adolf Hitler would have been able to put anti-Semitic advertisements on Facebook had the social network existed in the 1930s, according to British comedian and actor Sacha Baron Cohen.<br/><br/>The 48-year-old "Ali G" star singled out the US tech giant during a searing broadside Thursday against social media companies amplifying hatred and violence as part of "the greatest propaganda machine in history."<br/><br/>Speaking at Never Is Now, the Anti-Defamation League's New York conference on anti-Semitism and hate, he targeted Facebook for running political advertisements without fact-checking.<br/><br/>"Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem,'" Baron Cohen said as he accepted the ADL's International Leadership Award.<br/><br/>Facebook told AFP however the actor had misrepresented its policies.<br/><br/>"Hate speech is actually banned on our platform. We ban people who advocate for violence and we remove anyone who praises or supports it," a spokesperson said.<br/><br/>"Nobody — including politicians — can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook."<br/><br/>Baron Cohen's remarks came a day after Google said it would not allow political advertisers to use "microtargeting" based on user browsing data, political affiliation or other factors, including on YouTube.<br/><br/>Google also sought to clarify its policy by indicating it does not allow "false claims" in advertising, political or otherwise.<br/><br/>The move followed a ban by Twitter on most kinds of political ads, and comes amid growing pressure on internet platforms to curb the spread of misinformation around political campaigns.<br/><br/>Facebook, which has rejected efforts to fact-check political speech or ads, is being urged to follow suit. -AFP</p>
