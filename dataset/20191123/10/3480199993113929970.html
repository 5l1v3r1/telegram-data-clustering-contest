      <p>The Coventry-born forward has made five starts since arriving on loan from National League outfit Solihull Moors.</p>
      <p>And Cowan has been delighted with the 25-year-old’s contribution in the dressing room as well as on the pitch, where he has netted once.</p>
      <p>“It’s just the character of the lad really,” said Cowan, who was taking his side to Guiseley today in the FA Trophy.</p>
      <p>“He’s someone who has come in and we haven’t known each other for a massive period of time, but I’d definitely go in the trenches with him.</p>
      <p>“And I know he would do with me as well. We’re very like-minded.</p>
      <p>“We’re quite similar people. I think the definition of a big character is someone who is comfortable around other big characters.</p>
      <p>“I think a lot of people portray they’re a big character and then shy away when others arrive.</p>
      <p>“He’s similar to how I was. I welcomed big characters and wanted everybody to be a part of it.</p>
      <p>“You don’t have to be the focal point, you want to be part of a successful machine and he’s that.</p>
      <p>“He’s been an unbelievable injection in the training room and what you’re seeing on the football pitch.</p>
      <p>“He’s an amazing lad and we’re really pleased to have him.”</p>
      <p>Stenson, who signed an 18-month contract with Moors when he joined them from Leamington in October 2018, is scheduled to stay with the Bucks until January 11.</p>
