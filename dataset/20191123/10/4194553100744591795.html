      <h1>Pep Guardiola insists he isn’t going anywhere – meaning Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp rivalry will continue</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:17:19+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Pep Guardiola says he will not be leaving Manchester City next summer, despite some speculation linking him with a move away from the Etihad Stadium, with Bayern Munich among those to have considered him, according to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11867423/pep-guardiola-bayern-munich-know-i-will-respect-manchester-city-contract">Sky Sports</a>.</p>
      <p>Nine points behind the Reds at this stage of the season, Guardiola does not believe his time is up in Manchester just yet, even if the number of suitors across Europe would be vast should he take that decision.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-leave-unhappy-contract-liverpool-loss-premier-league-1320507">iNews</a>, Guardiola said: <b>“Why should people think I’m not happy here? Because we lost at Anfield or I’ve lost three games this season? That’s an odd reason to say I’m not happy or satisfied to be here. The real situation is 198 points in two seasons is exceptional.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“The moment I leave is when I feel my team don’t follow me to play at Anfield in the way we played. The players may say completely the opposite but I don’t have that feeling.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Guardiola sticking around is great news for the Premier League. His touchline antics at Anfield were comedy gold, but he’s also one of the best coaches there has ever been.</p>
      <p>Liverpool would not have reached the level they are at right now had it not been for the Spaniard’s side being as good as they are, so keeping him in Manchester is a good thing.</p>
      <p>The rivalry between the sides, despite it not feeling like it at times, is based on a respect for the level that each has reached over the last couple of seasons, and that, it appears, is only going to continue.</p>
