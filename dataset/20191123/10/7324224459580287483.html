      <p>Sharing the TV show’s official Twitter account post, Kardashian West wrote: “I literally recorded this and set this as my alarm a few weeks ago!”</p>
      <p>The unique wake-up call from Jenner, 70, was a take on her daughter Kylie Jenner’s greeting to her baby Stormi that went viral.</p>
      <p>Fans of I’m A Celebrity have noted that while Jenner has discussed her relatives in the jungle, they have appeared to be silent in supporting her.</p>
      <p>Jenner was born Bruce and was an Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete.</p>
      <p>She came out as a trans woman in April 2015 when she was in her late 60s, changing her name to Caitlyn.</p>
      <p>Jenner was married to the family matriarch Kris, the mother of Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob Kardashian, from 1991 until 2015.</p>
      <p>Together they had daughters Kendall and Kylie, and Jenner also has four children from previous marriages.</p>
