      <h3>PORAC, Pampanga – The Bureau of Customs Port of Clark (BoC-Clark) destroyed yesterday multi-million pesos worth of cigarette manufacturing machines and 145 cases of fake cigarettes here as part of its campaign against illicit trade and customs fraud.</h3>
      <p>District Collector Ruby Alameda of the BoC-Clark said the two machines and fake cigarettes came from the BoC warehouse in Bulacan and were subjected to crushing and incineration after receiving a go-signal from the BoC national office.</p>
      <p>Alameda said bogus Bureau of Internal Revenue stamps were also incinerated.</p>
      <p>She said the machines and fake cigarettes and stamps were seized last year from illegal manufacturers.</p>
      <p>“These machines were used to manufacture fake cigarettes in violation of existing laws and charges for other crimes, including use of fake BIR stamps and violation of the Intellectual Property Rights law have been recommended to be filed against the owner of the machines and the fake tobacco products,” the BoC-Clark district collector said.</p>
