      <p>BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) — Raul Jimenez continued his red-hot scoring streak as in-form Wolverhampton made it eight games unbeaten in the English Premier League with a 2-1 win at 10-man Bournemouth on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Mexico striker claimed his sixth goal in seven games to double Wolves’ lead after Joao Moutinho opened the scoring at Vitality Stadium with a superb free kick.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth played 53 minutes a man down after captain Simon Francis was sent off in his first top-flight start for 11 months. His team pulled a goal back in the second half, though, through Steve Cook but was unable to salvage a point.</p>
      <p>Victory for Nuno Espirito Santo’s visitors lifted them to fifth place in the table ahead of Thursday’s Europa League game at Braga.</p>
      <p>Bournemouth dropped to 11th after just one win from seven league fixtures.</p>
