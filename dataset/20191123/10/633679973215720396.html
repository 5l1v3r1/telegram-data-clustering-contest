      <p>The Independent Police Investigative Directorate is probing a shooting incident involving an off-duty policeman in Thembalethu, George on Friday evening.</p>
      <p>IPID spokesperson, Sontaga Seisa says is alleged that the police sergeant, based at Middleburg in the Eastern Cape, shot and killed his girlfriend's 30-year old sister.</p>
      <p>He says it is further alleged that after killing the woman, the suspect was looking for his girlfriend, who is also a member of SAPS Middleburg.</p>
      <p>Seisa says after failing to trace his girlfriend, the suspect realized that the police were looking for him, and he then decided to flee the area in his private car.</p>
      <p>He says the man committed suicide by shooting himself with his firearm some 200 kilometres from Middleburg.</p>
      <p>IPID is investigating the matter.</p>
