      <p>GEORGE TOWN, Nov 23 — Nibong Tebal Parti Amanah Negara (Amanah) chief Dr Roslan Ahmad has been appointed the new Penang Amanah chairman, taking over from Datuk Seri Mujahid Yusof Rawa.</p>
      <p>Mujahid, who is also Amanah vice-president and Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department, said the appointment was made at the Amanah Penang Convention, which party president Mohamad Sabu officiated here earlier today.</p>
      <p>He also revealed that he had declined reappointment for the state party chairman post as he wanted to focus on his federal duties.</p>
      <p>“Alhamdulillah, the convention was a success and the state committee polls was also successfully conducted using the e-voting system,” he said when met by reporters at the “Cherita Acheen Street” event here today.</p>
      <p>He hoped the new state party leadership will continue its good ties with the Penang government, now that the Amanah was also a component party in the state. — Bernama</p>
