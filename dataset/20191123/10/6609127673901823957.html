      <p>After finding her the kind-hearted local gave the cat some chicken while waiting for the Scottish SPCA to arrive.</p>
      <p>The moggy, who is now affectionately known as Bessie, was left with “scabby skin” after being dumped.</p>
      <p>But rescuers say she was found “just in the time” as the netting she was entangled in had not yet broken her skin.</p>
      <p>The Scottish SPCA launched a probe after the horrific discovery as they appeal to the public for information.</p>
      <p>Animal rescue officer Sheena McTaggart said: “The female cat was found in a carrier with no door.</p>
      <p>“She was in a sorry state, with scabby skin and a large piece of netting wrapped around her neck.</p>

      <p>“Luckily, the netting had only rubbed away her fur and not broken the skin so we found her just in time.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful to the member of the public who found her and fed her some chicken while he waited for us to arrive.</p>
      <p>“One of our animal rescue and rehoming centres is providing the care she needs.</p>
      <p>“The team have affectionately named her Bessie.</p>
      <p>“We’re keen to find out more about the circumstances that led to her becoming entangled in the net and subsequently ending up abandoned.</p>
      <p>“If anyone has any information, we would urge them to call our confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.”</p>
      <p>We told on Wednesday how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/scottish-news/4976371/glasgow-cat-kitten-clinic-eyes-blind/">a tiny kitten was left blind after being neglected</a> by its owner and sold online at just four-weeks-old.</p>
      <p>The cat, named Cookie, was sold to a buyer who was unaware of the animal's critical eye condition.</p>
      <p>The malnourished moggy has now been left with horror wounds and unable to see.</p>
