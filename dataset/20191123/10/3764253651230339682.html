      <p>City were hammered 3-1 by the Merseyside outfit before FIFA international break - a result that prompted the rumour of him leaving when the season is over.</p>
      <p>However, the Bayern Munich boss, was quoted by SunSport while addressing the media ahead of his side's game this weekend saying: “<i>If the people ask ‘do I want to stay</i>?’</p>
      <p>"<i>I want to stay, I don’t have any reasons to move from here. “I am incredibly satisfied working with this club, with these players</i>.</p>

      <p>“<i>And if the people think I am going to resign or be sacked for these results and the fact we are nine points behind Liverpool then people don’t know me</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>If the club wants me next season, I want to be here — 100 percent. “I want to live in this city because I know lovely people here and I want to work and live with them</i>.”</p>

      <p>When he was asked about Manchester City's position on the table, Guardiola seems undisturbed by their current stance, saying the challenge is good for his team.</p>
      <p>Guardiola added: “<i>I like this challenge, I love to be in this position. “If I don’t win I’m in trouble, I know that. But I’m incredibly happy to work in this city and for this club</i>.</p>

      <p>“<i>And I want to help this club to get better. “I still enjoy working with these players a lot and I would like to stay longer. If the club wants, I will stay</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>Why should people think I’m not happy here? Because we lost at Anfield or I’ve lost three games this season</i>?</p>
      <p>“<i>That’s an odd reason to say I’m not happy or satisfied to be here. The real situation is 198 points in two seasons, that is exceptional</i>.</p>
