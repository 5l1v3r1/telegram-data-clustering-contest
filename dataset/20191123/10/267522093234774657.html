      <p><a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-uk-deals-update-nov-20">Black Friday deals</a> are rolling in now, and one of the world's top action cameras, the DJI Osmo Action with voice control, is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/DJI-Action-Digital-Resistant-HDR-Video/dp/B07RJMK2GV">now on sale at Amazon UK for a walloping £100 off at £229</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Digital-Displays-Waterproof-HDR-Video/dp/B07RJMK2GV/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=DJI+Osmo+action&amp;qid=1574503377&amp;sr=8-3">on sale at Amazon US for $100 off at $279.90</a>. That makes it a staggering £150/$120 cheaper than the official £379.99/$399.99 RRP of its arch rival the GoPro Hero 8 Black.</p>
      <p>In our <a href="https://www.t3.com/reviews/dji-osmo-action-review"><u>DJI Osmo Action review</u></a>, we awarded it a huge 5-star review, declaring it one of the best in the world. Even though the GoPro Hero 8 Black is our top <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/best-action-cameras">action camera</a> overall, the Osmo Action isn’t far behind. It even scores some points over GoPro, namely because it has a built-in front display, so when you’re recording to camera, you can see instantly if you’re properly in frame.</p>
      <p>The DJI Osmo Action is ideal for action adventure junkies, mountain bikers, hikers and lifestyle vloggers and travel vloggers alike. With such big discounts available, this is a great time to buy it. Here's the deal:</p>

The Osmo Action sports a 90-minute battery life, shoots at 4K30, and is capable of slow-motion shots. It's boasting DJI's brilliant RockSteady EIS for gimbal-like smoothness to your action videos.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Digital-Displays-Waterproof-HDR-Video/dp/B07RJMK2GV/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=DJI+Osmo+action&amp;qid=1574503377&amp;sr=8-3">VIEW DEAL</a></p>

      <p>Apart from the game-changing built-in front display, the top features of the DJI action camera include voice control, a generous 90-minute battery life, and the capability to shoot at 4K30. There’s also QuickSwitch fast navigation between HDR, regular video, TimeLapse and other customised modes.</p>
      <p>Want a variety of filming modes? The Osmo Action delivers in spades: it shoots up to UHD 4K60 at 100Mbps and benefits from DJI’s RockSteady electronic image stabilisation (EIS) tech. RockSteady EIS is similar to GoPro’s award-winning HyperSmooth tech, bringing gimbal-like smoothness to action camera videos.</p>
      <p>As for ultra-cool slow motion shots, DJI’s action cam shoots up to 8x slow motion at 1080p240. Stills are ace too, with the fun centering around a raft of manual settings: use them to max out the shutter speed at 1/8000s, to boost image clarity in bright sunshine, or drop to 120 seconds for slick, long exposures.</p>
