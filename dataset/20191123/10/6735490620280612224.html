      <p><i>That </i>didn’t last long.</p>
      <p>After just one season behind the table at “America’s Got Talent”, newbie judges Julianne Hough and Gabrielle Union are both exiting the show.</p>
      <p>According to a report in <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/gabrielle-union-julianne-hough-out-at-americas-got-talent-1203413880/"><i>Variety</i></a>, an NBC spokesperson confirmed that neither Hough nor Union will be returning for the 2020 season of “AGT”.</p>

      <p>Representatives for Union and Hough did not respond to <i>Variety</i>‘s requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Union and Hough were brought in last season to replace longtime judges Mel B and Heidi Klum, and the departure of the new judges now leaves two empty chairs to fill before the show returns in the summer for season 15.</p>
      <p>Judges Simon Cowell (who is also the show’s exec producer) and Howie Mandel are both expected to return, as is host Terry Crews.</p>
