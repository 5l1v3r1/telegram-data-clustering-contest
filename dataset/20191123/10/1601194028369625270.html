      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/pmco-fall-split-south-asia-2019-finals">PMCO Fall Split 2019</a> Prelims for Global Finals are being held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The 2nd match of Prelims Day 1 took place in the map Sanhok, from a third-person perspective. The flight path for this match started from the south-west part of the map and went towards the north-east part of the map. The first play-zone formed pretty much in the center of the map and that meant that there was no additional pressure on players to rush inside the zone.</p>

      <p>The game started on a very chaotic note as IND lost Kratos to Futbolist as soon as they landed on the map. However, IND was quick to retaliate as they knocked out two members of Futbolist. The two teams went back and forth but an aggressive play from Futbolist resulted in a successful squad wipe of IND. SynerGE fought a close battle against Bigetron, where SynerGE came victorious. SynerGE wiped out the entire team of Bigetron securing four kills for themselves.</p>
