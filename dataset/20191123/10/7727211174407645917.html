        <i>So, as the teams prepare to do Premier League battle and Jurgen Klopp takes his men south, we've taken a look back at what happened during Hodgson's Anfield reign.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Liverpool confirmed the appointment of Roy Hodgson as manager on July 1, 2010.</p>
      <p>After the six-year tenure of the revered Rafa Benitez had come to a sad end, Hodgson, fresh from leading Fulham to the Europa League final, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/official-roy-hodgson-confirmed-new-3400422">was the man tasked with succeeding</a> the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>It was widely viewed as an uninspiring appointment, but it was a case of needs-must as the Reds faced up to the tall prospect of getting back towards where they had been 12 months earlier under Benitez.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2010, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> were gripped by the poisonous reign of their owners, money was tight and <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/david-prentice-new-liverpool-fc-3400398">Hodgson was seen as a safe pair of hands</a> to navigate through a uncertain immediate future.</p>
      <p>To their credit, Liverpool supporters, known largely for their patience and knowledge, understood Hodgson was placed in difficult job in trying circumstances as the detested owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett continued to cast a long and bleak shadow over Anfield.</p>
      <p>Of course circumstances were far from ideal, with a civil war raging in the boardroom during the final months of the ownership under Hicks and Gillett.</p>
      <p>Hodgson certainly didn’t have funds to spend and bad luck played a part with injuries to key personnel.</p>
      <p>At every turn, however, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/roy-hodgson-liverpool-revisiting-match-11373393">Hodgson created problems for himself</a>, with a string of soundbites that only served to place his foot firmly into his mouth.</p>
      <p>It was quickly apparent that he was a man out of his depth, repeatedly alienating supporters with a string of PR gaffes and faux-pas.</p>
      <p>Asked after a rare home win whether there was anywhere quite like Anfield for an atmosphere, Hodgson replied “the San Siro and Old Trafford are excellent”.</p>
      <p>The question was akin to a slide-rule pass without a goalkeeper in sight but Hodgson, inexplicably, could only manage to slice it wide of the post inside the six-yard box.</p>
      <p>Getting past Trabzonspor in the Europa League play-off round was once hailed as “a famous European night” and asked to respond to Alex Ferguson’s claims that Fernando Torres had been playacting to try to get John O’Shea sent off, his retort was: “Maybe Sir Alex had a better view of it than me”.</p>

      <p>Liverpool’s most pitiful derby display for a generation was described as “our best performance of the season”. Hodgson remains the last Liverpool manager to have been beaten by the Blues, with a 2-0 reverse at Goodison Park only serving to plummet morale further through the floor around Anfield.</p>
      <p>After a wretched defeat to Blackpool left the Reds in the bottom three for the first time in nearly half a century, Hodgson openly spoke about being in a relegation battle.</p>
      <p>Quite simply, he failed the grasp the enormity of the club he was in charge of and was unable to inspire players like Steven Gerrard and Torres, who had decided his days at Anfield were numbered while playing under Hodgson.</p>
      <p>The disconnect was alarming. The Kop chanted ‘Hodgson for England’ in an open show of dissent as the manager bemoaned that “the famous Anfield support has not really been there ever since I came here”.</p>
      <p>That was another own goal for Hodgson, whose ability to agitate a normally supportive, tolerant and rational fanbase became unique.</p>
      <p>That respect and devotion has to be earned. You have to give fans hope and something to believe in. Hodgson failed miserably on that score. The style of football was dour and conservative.</p>
      <p>His disastrous tenure, mercifully, lasted just over six months, as a 3-0 shelling at Blackburn proving to be the final nail in a coffin in January 2011.</p>
      <p>“I still see a lot of things positively and my glass is absolutely half-full rather than half-empty at the moment,” he said following the defeat to Blackburn.</p>
      <p>He was the only one who did. Two days later, he was sacked.</p>
      <p>Kenny Dalglish stepped in and immediately pulled in the angry and apathetic who were continuing to drift out to sea under the management of Hodgson.</p>
      <p>Nine years on, Liverpool are European champions and firmly recognised as one the finest teams on the planet under Jurgen Klopp. They head into coming season intent on building on a 97-point Premier League campaign and ending their 30-year wait for a league title.</p>
      <p>It's a world away from where the Reds stood on July 1 2010 when Hodgson took charge on a three-year contract.</p>
      <p>On the anniversary of its inception, Liverpool, thankfully, are unrecognisable from that sorry Hodgson episode both on and off the pitch.</p>
