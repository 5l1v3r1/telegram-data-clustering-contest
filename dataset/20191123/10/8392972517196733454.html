      </p>
      <p>The Black Friday deals will be available for 10 days from today (22.11.19) until December 2, or as long as stocks last.</p>
      <p>And shoppers can expect bargains on products like a 50-inch Samsung Smart 4K Ultra HD TV (down to £350 from £450), a Black &amp; Decker 2-In-1 Cordless Vacuum Cleaner (down to £40 instead of £99.99) and a Nescafe Dolce Gusto Piccolo Coffee Machine (down to £25 from £39).</p>
      <p>One word of warning though: B&amp;M doesn't feature an online shopping resource so you'll have to to go to your nearest store to pick up your bargain.</p>
      <p>This year's Black Friday is due to take place on Friday November 29, with Cyber Monday following on Monday December 2.</p>

      <p>"Last year, we actually found the Friday to be one of the worst days for deals.</p>
      <p>"The best deals were really at the beginning of the week when brands all compete against each other to get your money."</p>
