      <p>While Devendra Fadnavis may have his reasons to shake hands with NCP's Ajit Pawar and take his support to form the next government in Maharashtra, five years ago, the same Devendra Fadnavis had said the BJP will "never, never, never" form any alliance with the NCP.</p>
      <p>The reason, Fadnavis said, was that NCP is corrupt.</p>
      <p>"BJP will never, never, never have any alliance with NCP. Rumours are motivated. We exposed their corruption in assembly. Others were silent," Devendra Fadnavis had said in a tweet in September 2014.</p>

      <p>In the run-up to this year's Maharashtra assembly election, the BJP had launched scathing attacks on Ajit Pawar, who is facing investigations in a Rs 20,000-crore irrigation scam that allegedly took place during his tenure as Maharashtra's water resource minister.</p>

      <p>On Saturday, the political landscape of Maharashtra turned topsy-turvy after the BJP and a faction of the NCP, under the leadership of Ajit Pawar, joined hands to form government. BJP's Devendra Fadnavis took oath as chief minister and NCP's Ajit Pawar as deputy chief minister.</p>
      <p>The move took everyone by surprise because until Friday night, the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena were all set to form government to ensure BJP is kept out of power.</p>
      <p>Ever since the news broke out early morning, Twitter has been abuzz with people digging out old Fadnavis' old tweet against the NCP to portray his dramatic change in stand.</p>
      <p>Twitterati also retweeted his other tweets where he had lashed out at the NCP for being a corrupt party. In one such tweet, Devendra Fadnavis had said: "Adarsh (housing society scam) report rejected by the cabinet. Corrupt face of Congress NCP exposed. BJP will not spare any1. We will go to legal n people's court (sic)."</p>
      <p>These tweets provided sufficient ammunitions for Twitterati to have a field's day in the backdrop of Maharashtra's rapidly changing political landscape.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: "In politics never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever....say never."</p>
      <p>Another cheekily remarked: "@Dev_Fadnavis lol sir delete the tweet immediately nahi to muh dikhana mushkil ho jayega twitter par."</p>
