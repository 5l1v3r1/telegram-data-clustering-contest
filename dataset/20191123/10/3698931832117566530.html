      <h1>Would you get the Garmin Vivomove 3 over an Apple Watch?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:06:34+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/nic/" target="_blank">Nic Ker</a></address>
      <p>A number of <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/garmin">Garmin</a> <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/wearables">wearables</a> have hit the Malaysian market in recent times, and it can be a little hard to keep track of it all. But if you look carefully, each model has a distinct set of offerings, with features that are seemingly targeted towards different audiences in the market. The <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/garmin-fenix-6">Fenix 6</a> series is for serious activity tracking (<a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/08/garmin-fenix-6-6x-sapphire-edition-first-impressions/">as I found out</a>), the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/garmin-marq">Marq</a> series for the upper-end of the market, and the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/garmin-venu">Venu</a> for the casual smartwatch wearer.</p>
      <p>So where does the new Garmin Vivomove 3 series find its niche? The Garmin Vivomove 3S, 3, and Style, are 3 variants of the latest Garmin smartwatch, and the series appears to be an option for those of you who want the functionality of a modern smartwatch—but in the body, and design, of a conventional timepiece.</p>

      <p>All variants share much of the same features, but one of the key differences is that the Vivomove 3S has a 39mm case size, while the Vivomove 3 measures in at 44mm. The Vivomove Style, meanwhile, is 44mm is size—and boasts an AMOLED display.</p>
      <p>And with the top-end variant of the Vivomove style going for around the same price as an <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/apple-watch-series-5">Apple Watch Series 5</a>, would you go for one of Garmin’s new smartwatches over an Apple Watch? It depends.</p>

      <h3>A hybrid approach</h3>
      <p>If you watch the videos above, you’ll know that the Vivomove smartwatches are “hybrid smartwatches”—essentially a combination of a traditional timepiece and a smartwatch. Raise your wrist or double tap the watch face to bring up the “smart” element of the watch, including menus and widgets, or leave it looking like a traditional watch.</p>
      <p>According to Garmin, the series maintains much of the functionality of a modern smartwatch: smart notifications, fitness features, as well as Garmin’s advanced health monitoring.</p>
      <p>This includes Pulse Ox tracking, Body Battery readings, menstrual tracking, and a lot of Garmin’s suite of fitness features. Unfortunately, the Vivomove 3 series doesn’t come with built-in GPS, so the watches use a connected smartphone’s GPS for tracking functions—which means that you won’t be able to use them as truly standalone devices.</p>
      <p>Durability-wise, the Vivomove Style uses Corning Gorilla Glass, which should mean that it will be reasonably durable. You also have the option for a nylon strap, which is the more expensive option on the Style. Meanwhile, the Vivomove 3 and 3S only have monochromatic LED displays, as opposed to the coloured AMOLED display on the Style.</p>

      <p>All models are compatible with Android and iOS devices, and work along with the Garmin Connect app that other Garmin wearables use. Garmin also promises up to 5 days of battery life in smartwatch mode, with an additional week of battery for standard watch mode.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the Vivomove 3 series might appeal to those of you that want something with the aesthetic appeal of a conventional watch, and some of the smartwatch features are right up there with the more premium smartwatches. But without built-in GPS, the series is somewhat inhibited by its inability to function as a standalone device—unlike many smartwatches, including the Apple Watch.</p>
