      <p>Protesters will march through Paris to pressure the French government to take stronger steps to prevent deadly domestic violence, a problem that President Emmanuel Macron has called “France’s shame.”</p>
      <p>France has among the highest rates in Europe of domestic violence, in part because of poor police responses to reports of abuse.</p>
      <p>Activists say 130 women have been killed by a current or former partner this year alone in France, about one every two or three days.</p>
      <p>Domestic violence victims and activists have glued posters around France after each death to draw attention to the problem.</p>
      <p>They plan a march in Paris on Saturday before the French government unveils new measures Monday to tackle the problem.</p>
      <p>The measures are expected to include seizing firearms from people suspected of domestic violence and prioritizing police training.</p>
