      <p>Sides are arguably the best part of the Thanksgiving table. Take the traditional route with roasted <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019749-homemade-green-bean-casserole">green bean casserole</a>, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/331-sweet-potato-casserole">sweet potato casserole</a>, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/thanksgiving/296355-thanksgiving-potato-recipes">mashed potatoes</a> and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/2-how-to-make-stuffing">stuffing</a>.

      <p>Love it or hate it, cranberry sauce adds a much-needed jolt of color and flavor that cuts through the rich, very brown food on the Thanksgiving table. Sam Sifton’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018928-cranberry-sauce">cranberry sauce</a> (above) is as classic as it gets, and it’s just four ingredients: fresh cranberries, sugar, orange juice and zest. For a fresher taste, whiz fresh cranberries, a whole orange (rind and all), a handful of pecans and honey in a food processor for a crunchy <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012886-cranberry-orange-relish">cranberry orange relish</a>. If Thanksgiving is the one time each year you trot out your Jell-O mold, Julia Moskin’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015472-cranberry-orange-jelly">cranberry-orange jelly</a> is here for you. Or do like Alison Roman does and gussy up <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020605-fancy-canned-cranberries">canned cranberry jelly with sliced oranges and red onion</a>.</p>

      <p>Pie haters, we see you. Alison Roman likes to make a <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020607-deep-dish-honey-apple-galette">deep-dish honey apple galette</a>, basically a galette baked in a springform pan, which is not much work, but very impressive. Mark Bittman’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11752-apple-crisp">apple crisp</a> is another low-effort, high-reward dessert that comes together in about an hour. If it’s not a party without cake, bake Yossy Arefi’s <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019728-pumpkin-layer-cake-with-caramel-buttercream">pumpkin layer cake with caramel buttercream</a> or <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019726-brown-sugar-layer-cake-with-cranberry-buttercream">brown sugar layer cake with cranberry buttercream</a> (above). Readers love them. Two other non-pie favorites are this eye-popping <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017817-cranberry-curd-tart">cranberry curd tart</a> and this <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017758-sticky-cranberry-gingerbread">sticky cranberry gingerbread</a>. Round out the dessert spread with a couple loaves of <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013989-banana-banana-bread">banana bread</a> and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020571-pumpkin-bread">pumpkin bread</a>.</p>

      <p>You have to eat before the big game!

      <p>Thanksgiving without leftovers? What’s the point? Once you’ve had your fill of <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016921-thanksgiving-sandwich">Thanksgiving-on-a-roll sandwiches</a>, make <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1012887-turkey-and-spinach-curry">turkey and spinach curry</a>, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020641-turkey-cubano">turkey Cubano</a>, <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020642-turkey-pitas-with-cucumbers-chickpeas-and-tahini">turkey pitas with cucumbers, chickpeas and tahini</a> or <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019047-thanksgiving-leftovers-enchilada-pie">Thanksgiving leftovers enchilada pie</a> and <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019048-cranberry-sauce-salsa">cranberry sauce salsa</a>. (Sounds weird, but it’s delicious!) You could also sub in turkey for the chicken in <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7378-chicken-tarragon-pot-pie">Julia Child’s chicken potpie</a> or <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/6341-chicken-and-sausage-gumbo">Paul Prudhomme’s gumbo</a>. We’ve tried it in both; it’s good! Finally, if you have any leftover pie, the cookbook author <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqf7Oudl-oE/">Erin Jeanne McDowell likes to blend a slice with a few scoops of ice cream</a>. Genius.</p>
