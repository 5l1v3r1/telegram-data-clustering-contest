      <h1>House pressing higher vape taxes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:53:59+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/jester-p-manalastas" target="_blank">Jester P. Manalastas</a></address>
      <h3>WITH or without the ban, the House of Representatives is pushing for higher taxes on vape products.</h3>
      <p>Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means, said that the House will retain the taxes on vape and might even go for higher rates.</p>
      <p>“We will retain it pero given the logic of the initial reported ban -- precautionary principle -- we might  go for a higher rate than P25/ml to P45/ml,” Salceda said.</p>
      <p>According to the House leader, the 1 million vape users are almost totally upper middle to high income class versus the 23 million smokers with 7 million in the lowest 50 percent.  </p>
      <p>The entry cost to vaping is relatively high at P1,600.</p>
      <p>President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered a ban on vaping in public and even ordered the arrest of violators.</p>
      <p>Salceda said they will repeal Section 2 of Republic Act 11346, passed by the previous (17th) Congress, even if it means revenue loss of P1.4 billion for the government.</p>
      <p>In August, the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading HB 1026 raising anew the excise taxes on alcohol products, heated tobacco and vapor products.</p>
