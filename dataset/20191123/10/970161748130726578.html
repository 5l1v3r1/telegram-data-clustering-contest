      <p>Last night’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/tory-labour-mp-caught-backstage-face-off-leaders-debate-11204744/">BBC Question Time Leaders’ Special</a> was a display of human vulnerability – of grand political postures withering under the scrutiny of a leery public.</p>
      <p>Political leaders can cope with confronting one another in exchanges of well-rehearsed soundbites; they can endure the most forensic grilling from professional interviewers; but faced with a Greek chorus whose pointed questions are supplemented by derisive laughter and grunts of incredulity, their worlds are truly shaken.</p>
      <p>Some of the best moments in this event were non-verbal. To be laughed at is profoundly unsettling.</p>
      <p>When<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/"> Boris Johnson</a> was asked how important it was for someone in his position of power to always tell the truth there was an eruption of knowing laughter, as if to say, ‘How do you ask a man who won’t tell the truth whether he’s telling the truth?’ The same jeering response to the trust question occurred in the ITV debate a few days earlier.</p>

      <p>How is a political leader to respond when the very notion of his being trustworthy evokes laughter? Perhaps that’s why towards the end of a gruelling 30 minutes the prime minister was reduced to uttering the banality, ‘All I can say to you is to repeat what I said’. I see.</p>
      <p>Disdainful laughter followed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jeremy-corbyn/">Jeremy Corbyn</a>’s claim that he would negotiate a new withdrawal agreement with the European Union and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/jeremy-corbyn-reveals-hell-remain-neutral-second-brexit-referendum-11204179/">then remain neutral in a referendum</a> on its confirmation, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/22/jo-swinson-grilled-coalition-voting-record-lib-dems-branded-right-wing-party-11204234/">Jo Swinson</a>’s claim to be in with a real chance of becoming the next occupant of Number 10.</p>
      <p>This kind of audience response constitutes a collective exhalation of doubt. It is less a counter-argument than a demand not to be addressed as idiots. In this respect, it serves a valuable democratic function, expressing on behalf of millions watching at home a call for political leaders to abandon their professional disingenuity and answer the bloody question.</p>

      <p>Of course, the non-verbal responses that punctuate a studio-audience format of this kind are no less innocent than the politicians on the stage. It is important to remember that this audience was selected to represent a range of partisan loyalties.</p>
      <p>Many of these people are politically savvy and know exactly how wounding a well-timed audience response can be. Even public groaning has become weaponised. One audience member criticised other members for groaning at Corbyn. Perhaps a future event could be organised without the leaders being there at all, leaving all the action to a battle of factional groans and chortles.</p>

      <p>The turbulent atmosphere of a studio-audience format gave rise to some moments that were probably good for democracy. Both <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nicola-sturgeon/">Nicola Sturgeon</a> and Boris Johnson offered to follow up on a questioner’s point after the programme. Just how well they honour these invitations will be interesting to hear about.</p>
      <p>Democratic politics is not about always having pat answers but being open to going to the next level when problems are complex. The heckler in the front row who insisted on getting a reason for the government’s non-publication of the Intelligence Committee’s report on Russian interference in British elections was more persistent than many journalists.</p>
      <p>Having studied televised election debates around the world, my sense is that they have now become a permanent feature of the electoral landscape in the UK, which only started having them in 2010. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/theresa-may/">Theresa May</a>’s refusal to participate in one in 2017 certainly contributed to the implosion of her campaign.</p>
      <p>The Question Time format, which pits party leaders against a Greek chorus, satisfies the more rumbustious demands of democracy; the importance of exposing power to direct public accountability.</p>
      <p>The more formal head-to-head debates offer different kinds of insight into a future prime minister’s capacity to survive in the combative context of fundamental policy disagreement.</p>
      <p>Both formats are good for democracy. They reach potential voters who might not bother to look at any other aspects of the campaign. They help the undecided to make up their minds. They trigger debates in living rooms across the country. They are emotionally cathartic.</p>

      <p>And, if nothing else, it is satisfying to watch the balloons deflate.</p>
