      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> insists Lucas Torreira needs to improve his playmaking abilities before he is trusted to play at the base of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>’s midfield.</p>
      <p>The combative Uruguay international impressed last season following his transfer from Sampdoria, having been identified by the club’s former head of recruitment Sven Mislintat.</p>
      <p>Torreira’s form, however, tailed off towards the end of last term and, after arriving back late following international commitments in the summer, he has been in and out of Emery’s side.</p>
      <p>When he has appeared, the 23-year-old has been asked to play in an unfamiliar, more advanced role. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/lucas-torreira-unhappy-unai-emery-arsenal-transfer-news-11166862/">Torreira’s agent claimed earlier this week that Emery’s tactical demands were a source of frustration</a> to his client who has been heavily linked with a return to Serie A, amid reported interest from Napoli and AC Milan.</p>

      <p>‘We need that position for the capacity to build up, it’s a big responsibility.</p>
      <p>‘He needs to achieve confidence, achieve more matches and more experience to take the confidence to do that.</p>
      <p>‘He can play as a defensive midfielder but we need a defensive midfielder [to be] offensive because the build up for us is very important.</p>
      <p>‘Lucas can learn and improve but to give him that responsibility of building up and creating a lot of combinations with our team, he needs more time to learn or improve in that issue.’</p>
