      <h1>Sasha Baron Cohen uses example of Hitler in dig at Facebook</h1>

        <b>Some serious shots were fired</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sasha Baron Cohen recently attended an Anti-Defamation League summit on anti-Semitism and hate in New York.</p>
      <p>During the summit, the British comedian behind Borat and Ali G, slammed social media platforms, in particular Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
      <p>No stranger to joking around, Baron Cohen was definitely not joking this time. He hit out at social media giants for facilitating the spread of misinformation around political campaigns.</p>
      <p>Addressing the summit, Baron Cohen took a dig at Zuckerberg, who in October, defended his company's position not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods.</p>

      <p>The comedian even went as far to say, that, if Facebook was present at the time Hitler was in power, they would allow the former dictator to post anti-Semitic ads.</p>
      <p>"If you pay them, Facebook will run any 'political' ad you want, even if it's a lie. And they'll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect," Baron Cohen said.</p>
      <p>"Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his 'solution' to the 'Jewish problem'.</p>

      <p>The Brit also called for “a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies and lies,” criticising Zuckerberg's recent comments suggesting stricter rules for social media posts would "pull back on free expression."</p>
      <p>Concluding his speech, he said:</p>
      <p>“The ultimate aim of society should be to make sure that people are not targeted, not harassed and not murdered because of who they are, where they come from, who they love or how they pray.”</p>
      <p>“If we make that our aim — if we prioritise truth over lies, tolerance over prejudice, empathy over indifference and experts over ignoramuses — then maybe, just maybe, we can stop the greatest propaganda machine in history, we can save democracy, we can still have a place for free speech and free expression, and, most importantly, my jokes will still work."</p>
