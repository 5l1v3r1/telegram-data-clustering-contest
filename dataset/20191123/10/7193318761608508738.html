      <p>EDMOND — Where was I? What was I doing? Wait. What? Who am I? Why am I here? (Young people, Google "Admiral Stockdale.")</p>
      <p>(Waking up) OMG! it's not a dream! This house! It's mine (and the bank's)!</p>
      <p>Dear Prospective New Homeowner, as a homeowner you will often feel as overwhelmed as Vice Adm. James Stockdale, retired, appeared to be during the 1992 vice presidential debate as Dallas zillionnaire Ross Perot's running mate.</p>
      <p>Stockdale, battle scarred, Vietnam War Medal of Honor winner, prisoner of war for seven years, was not flustered, but misunderstood, and mocked for it. As a homeowner, no matter how battle-tested you become while fighting the gremlins and goblins that reside in your house, you will sometimes get flustered and feel misunderstood.</p>
      <p>Your house's gremlins and goblins, if not your house itself, will be mocking you.</p>
      <p>Ah, the early 1990s. This old house of ours was just a kid then, a 10-year-old in 1992, if my calculations are correct. I calculate that the ratio of house years to people years is 2-1. So, in 1992, the house, built in 1987, was 5 years old but 10 in people years. Which means when we bought it in 1999, it was 12, but 24 in people years.</p>
      <p>So, now this old house is 32, and it thinks it is still full of spit and vinegar, but it's 64 in people years, which explains why it wet itself on Halloween night or the wee (snicker) hours of Nov. 1, with a busted pipe UNDER THE SLAB, which unleashed a special kind of homeownership hell, arousing more gremlins and goblins.</p>
      <p>Dear Prospective New Homeowner, again, for your education and edification, I have italicized terms and phrases you will learn if you live more than a few years in any house.</p>
      <p>They do not teach you this in <i>new homeowners class</i>, but unless you literally built your house yourself, or got a <i>custom contractor</i> and followed the builder and <i>subs</i> around every hour of every day, you probably have whole nests of <i>gremlins</i> and <i>goblins</i> in your house. The <i>noise you hear in the pipes</i> at night? That's not <i>"water hammer,"</i> as <i>"they"</i> will tell you. Ha, ha, no. It's them.</p>
      <p>The nests start as gremlin and goblin traps left by someone on a <i>construction crew.</i> Two examples:</p>
      <p>The wall behind our refrigerator is <i>not finished</i>, and the outlet has no <i>wall plate</i>. Huh. Well, why bother? No one will see it — until you see it.</p>
      <p>And in the bathrooms, the <i>tile was laid</i> over the <i>toilet floor flanges</i> — and I cannot tell you how infuriating it was awhile back that the plumber had to bust it up to replace one of the toilets. (Note to self: Use the tubes of <i>Quikrete</i> and-or <i>Dap</i> you bought.)</p>
      <p>Now, when last we <i>commiserated</i>, the leak <i>UNDER THE SLAB</i> had just been detected. I was writing on Tuesday, Nov. 6, just after the <i>huge industrial dryers</i> and <i>dehumidifiers</i> had been taken away, so I didn't have to <i>YELL TO BE HEARD</i>.</p>
      <p>That Thursday, the plumber showed up with a <i>JACKHAMMER</i> AND ALL DURING AN ONLINE CLASS I TAKE ON THURSDAY MORNINGS I HAD TO KEEP MY MIC MUTED.</p>
      <p>By the following Tuesday, the house had not yet returned to normal, so I decided to postpone Part 2 of this two-part home ownership tale of ordeal for a week. Surely, I thought, surely it will be behind me in time to write the next column and wrap it up.</p>
      <p>Ha, ha. SILLY ME! AND NOW I'M YELLING NOT TO BE HEARD OVER THE NOISE BUT BECAUSE — ahem, sorry — it's not over.</p>
      <p>Twenty days now. What remains to be done is minor, but it still remains to be done — a couple of strips of baseboard left unreattached. I could do it myself, but I will not.</p>
      <p>Here are some gremlins and goblins that got stirred up that we didn't see coming:</p>
      <p>My wife's car conked out at the local hotel where she stayed the seven days the house had <i>no running water</i>. The hotel messed up the billing so badly — charging me for twice as many days as she stayed, then seeming so incompetent and incapable of correcting it, I had to ask the bank to formally <i>dispute the charges</i>.</p>
      <p>The evening of the day we finally got the house back in working order and thought we could relax, Sunday evening, Nov. 17 (in the chaos, I hadn't noticed the unreattached baseboards), the refrigerator quit. It is under <i>extended warranty</i>.</p>
      <p>It's Wednesday. The repair guy is supposed to show up <i>between 8 a.m. and noon</i>. It is now 12:01 p.m.</p>
      <p>Dear Prospective New Homeowner: <i>When it rains, it pours</i>. I will spare you and everyone else the rest of the story. Some things still can't be printed in a family newspaper.</p>
