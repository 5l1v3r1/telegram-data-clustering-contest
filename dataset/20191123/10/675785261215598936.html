      <h2>A series of tragic illnesses ravaged the 30-year-old's face, forcing her to seek treatment abroad after facing cruel taunts that she was a 'monster'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:44:09+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Jaffray, Ben Weich</a></address>
      <p>A mother-of-two met and married the love of her life after a rare disease tragically ravaged her face, causing her nose to fall into her face..</p>
      <p>Ana Roman, 30, was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cancer">cancer</a> in November 2017 after she collapsed, with medics later discovering a mass in the base of her skull.</p>
      <p>The cancer weakened her immune system and she then developed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health">microscopic polyangitis</a> - a rare condition which causes blood vessel inflammation and left her nose sunken.</p>
      <p>The mum said was forced to face cruel taunts that she was a 'monster'.</p>
      <p>Ana, the manager of a car auction, underwent a complex, six-hour long operation to remove the back and lower parts of her skull, leaving her with no palate.</p>

      <p>It also caused her nose to recede into her face.</p>
      <p>Despite this, Ana met her current partner, 30-year-old Florin Petrescu, in the midst of all her health issues in January this year.</p>
      <p>The couple found each other through a mutual friend, before tying the knot last month.</p>
      <p>Florin proposed to Ana just 10 months after they met.</p>

      <p>She has now discovered she is pregnant with the couple's first child - after fearing the gruelling round of chemotherapy would leave her unable to bear any more children.</p>
      <p>Ana said: "After the first operation which left me with no palate I felt that a lot of people were looking at my face, some people even wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> that I look like a monster.</p>

      <p>"It was so hard to take my kids to school. But now after what it did to my face I can't believe I found love, I feel like the happiest woman in the world.</p>
      <p>"I am really lucky to have Florin, he supports me so much. Just the week after we met I was back in hospital.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for him. At one point I wanted to kill myself because of the pain."</p>
      <p>Ana was first diagnosed with a cancer of the palate in November 2017 after collapsing while visiting her brother in Germany.</p>
      <p>After undergoing three months of draining chemotherapy, which compromised her immune system, she was told in May 2018 that she also the rare condition known as microscopic polyangitis.</p>

      <p>Ana then battled through more chemotherapy, spending time in hospital in Romania and Belgium, before returning to the UK in January.</p>
      <p>Amid her personal turmoil, she found happiness last month when she married Florin in a bar in Manchester, in front of 50 friends and family.</p>
      <p>Florin, a self-employed valeter, added: "When I met Ana and discovered what was happening to her, I just wanted to be supportive.</p>
      <p>"If you love someone you go through good and bad times. I just want her to be healthy again."</p>
      <p>After being taken back <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hospitals">Manchester Royal Infirmary</a> in August this year, when the pain in her neck got worse, Ana was rushed to A&amp;E for an operation on her neck to clear up the scar tissue from a previous operation.</p>

      <p>She claims that nerve damage she allegedly suffered during surgery has left her unable to walk, and causes pain in her hand, which has left her unable to grasp items.</p>
      <p>She has now left the UK to be treated at a hospital in Romania - spending more than £1,500.</p>
      <p>A new procedure, which will involve operations on her neck and face, will leave her temporarily unable to walk.</p>
      <p>The family have been forced to leave the UK, despite Ana's ten-year-old son, David living in the country for most of his life.</p>

      <p>His three-year-old brother, Selim was born in Britain.</p>
      <p>Ana said: "I had pain in my neck before, but none of the other new symptoms. The constant pain is terrible. I have never been offered compensation even though the doctors messed up.</p>
      <p>"Last week I went back to hospital but was discharged, it was then I decided to leave the country. It is terrible, I don't want to bring my kids up here.</p>
      <p>"I have played by the rules but I don't want to live here anymore."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Manchester Royal Infirmary, which is managed by Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, said: "We are not aware of the allegations made by this patient.</p>
      <p>"We encourage the patient to get in touch with our dedicated Patient Advice and Liaison Team who can provide support and we can discuss any concerns they have.</p>
      <p>"We are unable to comment further due to patient confidentiality."</p>
