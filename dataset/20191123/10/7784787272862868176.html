      <h3>Adelaide United’s Riley McGree has emerged from a fog of controversy to score a brace in a 3-1 win against Melbourne Victory in Saturday night’s A-League grudge match.</h3>

      <p>But in the next minute, Adelaide’s Michael Maria scored before McGree slotted his second just six minutes later.</p>
      <p>McGree on Tuesday was suspended from internationals until April next year after an incident involving a Cambodian woman, whilehe was captaining Australia’s under 23 side last March.</p>
      <p>But the attacking midfielder shrugged off the furore with an influential display before a 12,198-strong crowd at Coopers Stadium.</p>
      <p>McGree’s opener came after a diagonal charge from teammate Ryan Strain which set-up Kristian Ospeth - the Norwegian strikerswung a right-footed shot which rolled into the far post.</p>

      <p>The ball rebounded to the tracking McGree, who deftly controlled with his body and tapped-in from a metre.</p>
      <p>The goal was deserved for Adelaide, who made the running as Reds recruit James Troisi orchestrated play from midfield against his former club. Troisi was industrious,striker Ospeth was creative up-front and Adelaide’s defence held firm until Victory substitutes Elvis Kamsoba and Robbie Kruse provided a brief second-half spark.</p>
      <p>Kruse expertly created Toivonen’s 61st minute goal, winning a duel with Strain and launching a left-footer across the goal-faceto his captain, whose first- timer thumped into the net.</p>
      <p>But Victory’s joy was as short-lived as possible.</p>

      <p>Adelaide’s Maria replied in the next minute - after a chain of possession from the re-start, he raced forward and darted into thebox, with his low left-footer clipping Victory’s diving Thomas Deng en route to the net.</p>
      <p>McGree sealed Adelaide’s fourth win of the season in the 68th minute, emerging in possession from a tangle with Tim Hoogland, cutting towards goaland firing from seven metres.</p>
