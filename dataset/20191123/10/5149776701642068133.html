      <p>It was reported a man had been hit over the head with a metal pole.</p>

      <p>Three more arrests were made following further disorder at the hospital while the victim was receiving treatment for his injuries.</p>
      <p>Inspector Georgie Ball from Nottinghamshire Police said: “Our officers are investigating this report of what is a particularly nasty assault and we have made a number of arrests as part of our enquiries.</p>
