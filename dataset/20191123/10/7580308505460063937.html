      <h1>Zimbabwe VP returns after months of medical care in China</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:08:44+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Zimbabwe’s Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, who led the ousting of Robert Mugabe, returned home Saturday, four months after he was airlifted to China for medical care, state media reported.</p>
      <p>Chiwenga, 63, who is seen as a major power-broker in Zimbabwean politics, had been in and out of hospital since the start of this year.</p>
      <p>In July, the government said he was being flown to China for “further tests” after he had been hospitalised in neighbouring South Africa.</p>
      <p>His ailment has not been disclosed.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe’s public health services have practically collapsed and more than 400 doctors have been sacked in recent weeks after they stopped going to work saying their salaries – decimated by hyperinflation – were not even enough for the commute to hospitals.</p>
      <p>Those Zimbabweans who can afford it seek treatment in South Africa or elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Ex-president Robert Mugabe died in September in Singapore where he had been receiving treatment for five months.</p>
      <p>Chiwenga was welcomed back by the Chinese deputy ambassador to Harare Zhao Baogang, according to state broadcaster ZBC.</p>
      <p>A video clip of his airport arrival shared on social media, showed no senior government official among the delegation receiving him when he stepped off a Chinese aircraft.</p>
      <p>The then army chief led the military takeover that ended Mugabe’s 37-year rule in 2017.</p>
