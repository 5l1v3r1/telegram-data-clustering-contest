      <p>For those of you who don’t know, Sajid has been booked under the #MeToo movement. He has been accused by three actors and a journalist for the same. Amid all the allegations, he had to step down from <a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/housefull-4-reviews-initial-out-this-akshay-kumar-riteish-deshmukh-led-film-termed-as-a-laughter-riot/"><i>Housefull 4</i></a> also. Akshay Kumar who was one of the lead actors in the film also tweeted and said “any proven offenders and all those who have been subjugated to harassment should be heard and given the justice they deserve’.</p>
      <p>#MeToo in India was started with Tanushree Dutta’s allegations on Nana Patekar which led to many women later coming out and revealing their side of the stories on the casting couch.</p>
