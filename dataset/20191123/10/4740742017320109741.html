      <h1>Everything you need to know about Viva! Vegan Christmas Festival in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>The event will feature the 'world's first vegan hogless roast'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T10:00:00+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>One of the best things about Christmas is the delicious food that comes with it, including the tasty treats served at festive markets.</p>
      <p>But the display of hog roasts and cheese platters can often leave the vegan and veggie communities feeling a little left out.</p>
      <p>That doesn't always have to be the case though, as the Viva! Vegan Christmas Festival demonstrates.</p>
      <p>Building on the success of last year's debut event, vegan charity Viva! is returning to the University of Bristol's Student Union with a delicious celebration of festive plant-based foods.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re looking for cracking ethical gifts for loved ones, some festive inspiration or just a yummy bite to eat, the festival promises to be a brilliant day out.</p>
      <h3>What's on offer?</h3>

      <p>There will also be talks and cookery demonstrations, including a live demo from the owner of Michelin-listed restaurant Acorn, Rich Buckley.</p>
      <p>People can also enjoy a talk from Viva! founder and director, Juliet Gellatley, on how going vegan can save the planet.</p>
      <p>Some of the edible treats on offer include indulgent vegan ice cream from Booja-Booja and luxury soya-based candles made by Avanti Candles, while street food traders include The Hogless Roast - said to be the world's first hogless roast and renowned for its quality.</p>

      <p>"Regardless of dietary choices, we want everyone to come along and see just how wonderful vegan food can be.</p>
      <p>"Christmas is a joyful time of year and we think there is no better way to spread peace and kindness during the festive season than to extend our compassion to all animals."</p>
