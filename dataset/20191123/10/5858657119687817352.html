      <p>TOKYO — The Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers have met on the sidelines of a Japan-hosted G-20 meeting a day after Seoul kept alive a 2016 military intelligence sharing pact with Tokyo, reversing its planned termination amid bilateral tensions.</p>
      <p>Japan’s Toshimitsu Motegi and South Korea’s Kang Kyung-wha were to discuss ways to mend their countries’ troubled ties Saturday in Nagoya, where Japan was hosting the foreign ministers meeting from the Group of 20 major economies.</p>
      <p>Motegi was expected to press Kang to stick with a 1965 agreement in resolving their dispute over wartime Korean labourers, seen as the root cause of tensions.</p>
      <p>Seoul’s announcement Friday followed a strong U.S. push to save the pact, a symbol of the country’s three-way security co-operation amid North Korea’s nuclear threats and China’s growing influence.</p>
