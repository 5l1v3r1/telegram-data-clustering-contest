      <p>Jeremy Corbyn was slammed for his ‘nice old grandpa act’ as he faced off with a BBC Question Time audience member last night.</p>
      <p>Ryan Jacobs, 36, blasted the Labour leader for his ‘disgraceful’ handling of anti-Semitic behaviour in his party in the leader’s special episode on Friday.</p>
      <p>The father, from Hull, accused the politician of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/07/01/corbyn-laughs-and-jokes-with-man-who-left-jewish-mp-ruth-smeeth-in-tears-5978221/">chatting happily</a> to a man who had heckled Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth at the launch of a report into anti-Semitism, leading her to leave the venue in tears.</p>
      <p>He told Mr Corbyn: ‘I heard you talk about free speech and standing up for human rights.</p>
      <p>‘I have two daughters and what terrifies me is that I look at some of the Labour MPs, some female MPs, and the misogyny that’s happened in the Labour Party.</p>

      <p>‘They’ve been driven out the party.</p>
      <p>‘I look at a video on YouTube with Ruth Smeeth particularly.</p>

      <p>‘I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt in terms of maybe people are doing it in your name and are not supported by you.</p>
      <p>‘But I look at a video of Ruth Smeeth online when she was in a press conference with you, and basically Ruth Smeeth, a Jewish MP, was heckled out of that press conference and there you are at the end of that press conference chatting happily to that same heckler.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t buy this nice old grandpa. I see that video and that tells me all I need to know and I’m terrified for my daughters because I see what you did in that video.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t understand how you can say you stand up for human rights and free speech when that’s how you support a Labour MP at a Labour press conference.</p>

      <p>‘I think it’s disgraceful.’</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: ‘Nobody should suffer any abuse in public life or privately, clear.</p>
      <p>‘Many women Labour MPs – Ruth Smeeth included and others – have suffered the most unbelievable levels of abuse.</p>

      <p>‘It was a Labour MP, Jo Cox, who was murdered because she stood up in public life.</p>
      <p>‘I ­simply say to you that bad behaviour, misogyny, racism is absolutely not acceptable in any form whatsoever in my party or in our society.’</p>
      <p>However, the Labour leader’s stance was not enough to satisfy Mr Jacobs.</p>
      <p>He responded: ‘Then why were you talking happily with a smile on your face to that same heckler when she’s been heckled in tears at the press conference?</p>
      <p>‘Why would Labour female MPs need bodyguards at a Labour conference?’</p>
      <p>Stating that he had had ‘many conversations with Ruth Smeeth since then’, Mr Corbyn replied: ‘I did say hello to him as I left the meeting, as you would somebody you would know yourself.</p>
      <p>‘And also, you don’t know what was said between us.’</p>

      <p>Mr Jacobs replied scathingly, saying: ‘Go look at the video Mr Corbyn.’</p>
      <p>The politician acknowledged that his party has a ‘real problem’ with anti-Semitism in July.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/21/corbyn-apologises-hurt-jewish-people-labour-publish-anti-semitism-guide-10436077/">an email to party members</a>, Mr Corbyn said Labour was ‘not immune from that poison’ and claimed they had to ‘drive it out’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, many people have argued that his response to racism in the party has not been acceptable.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/teenager-tricks-jeremy-corbyn-signing-poster-saying-anti-semite-11039425/">tricked</a> into signing a piece of paper with the words ‘I am an anti-Semite’ printed on it by a teenager at a campaign event.</p>
      <p>The Jewish Chronicle recently wrote to ‘fellow’ British Citizens’ urging them to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/jewish-chronicle-pleads-uk-boycott-corbyn-general-election-11056315/">not vote for Mr Corbyn</a> at the December 12 election.</p>
