      <p>The month-long political impasse ended dramatically with Devendra Fadnavis returning as the chief minister again, backed by the Sharad Pawar-led NCP.</p>
      <p>NCP leader Ajit Pawar was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister at Raj Bhavan.</p>
      <p>Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari administered the oath to the two in the morning ceremony, where only official media was present.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday congratulated Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar for taking oath as chief minister and deputy chief minister of Maharashtra respectively.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, he expressed confidence that the two will work for Maharashtra's development.</p>

      <p>"People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, after which President's rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable govt not a 'khichidi' govt," Fadnavis said.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar, after taking oath as the deputy chief minister, said: "From result day on October 24, no party was able to form the government. Maharashtra was facing many problems, including farmers issues. So we decided to form a stable government."</p>
      <p>The surprise swearing-in is being described as a political masterstroke of Sharad Pawar, who on Thursday night had said there was a consensus among the NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena that Uddhav Thackeray should lead the new government.</p>
