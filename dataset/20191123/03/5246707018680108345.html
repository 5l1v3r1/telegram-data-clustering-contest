      <p>As you might recall, <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/playstation_is_taking_part_in_a_japanese_super_smash_bros_ultimate_tournament">this week</a> the Japanese magazine Famitsu was hosting a special 'corporate' <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> tournament featuring a number of local firms. One rather big surprise included Nintendo's competitor PlayStation.</p>
      <p>In the end, Taisho Pharmaceutical <a href="https://japanesenintendo.com/2019/11/22/taisho-pharmaceutical-win-smash-tournament/">won the competition</a>, with its prize being a full-page advertisement and article in an upcoming issue of Weekly Famitsu magazine. Sony was knocked out in the semi-finals of the eight-team tournament by Zoff, and this firm was then taken out by Taisho. That's not what we're here for, though.</p>
      <p>Arguably the most exciting moment of this event was when Smash Bros. Ultimate director Masahiro Sakurai walked out on stage and told the crowd he had been working on a new fighter earlier on in the day. Here's the translation, courtesy of <a href="https://twitter.com/bk2128">BlackKite</a> via Japanese Nintendo:</p>
      <blockquote>Today I also made things in the company, such as a fighter whom hasn’t been known by everybody yet. And I came here after the work has ended.</blockquote>
      <p>It's always great to hear when Mr. Sakurai is working on a new fighter, but it's now got us wondering who it could be and if it is the next character or perhaps one in development that's due out at a much later date.</p>
      <p>If it is the fifth DLC character featured in the Fighter Pass, keep in mind this anticipated fighter may not necessarily be released this year. A notice on the <a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/">Smash Bros. website</a> says, "all packs will be released by Feb. 2020". Regardless of when the next fighter is made available, it seems like Sakurai will be working hard on Ultimate until the very end of 2019.</p>
