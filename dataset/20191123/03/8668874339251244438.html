      <p>England hooker <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/jamie-george/">Jamie George</a> is ready to fight for silverware on multiple fronts as <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> contend with the points deduction that places their <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership">Gallagher Premiership</a> survival in grave peril.</p>
      <p>The double winners are reeling after being docked 35 points and fined £5.36million for breaching salary cap regulations, plunging them into a desperate battle for survival.</p>
      <p>They host the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/ospreys">Ospreys</a> at Allianz Park on Saturday and George will arrive off the bench in the hope of lifting their Champions Cup defence.</p>

      <p>“As a five-year-old kid I used to come and watch Sarries play. We are in trouble at the minute and I just want to do as much as I can for that as well,” George said.</p>
      <p>“It is a difficult decision that we are going to have to make but – at the same time – I had a conversation with (assistant coach) Alex Sanderson about it and he was saying, ‘We’ve got this, you guys go and do your thing and progress your careers, we will look after it’.</p>
      <p>“I think it is four Premiership games we would miss out on, but I have every confidence that the group that wouldn’t be going away, that would be left here, would be ready as ever for that challenge.”</p>

      <p>Saracens currently sit at the bottom of Pool 4 in the Champions Cup following their campaign-opening 30-10 defeat to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/racing-92">Racing 92</a> in Paris last week.</p>
      <p>The reigning English and European champions also lie in last place in the Premiership with -22 points, but have won three of their opening four matches.</p>
