      <p>Boy group <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/onf">ONF</a> recently sat down with '<b>The Star</b>' magazine to answer all kinds of fan-sent questions, in light of their group pictorial featured in the magazine's December issue!</p>
      <p>The boys received a diary filled with various fan-sent questions, and read through each, containing remarks like <i>"ONF oppas went on strict diets for this comeback, so what were the foods you craved the most while dieting? How did you stay away from eating those foods?" </i>or <i>"ONF is the definition of perfect so it seems like you wouldn't have anything like a 'dark past', but do you have any 'dark past' stories to tell?"</i>, etc. The fans sent in some very detailed questions, making for great "TMI" facts from the members!</p>
      <p>You can watch the ONF members sharing tons of behind stories from their comeback preparations, their daily lives, and more with 'The Star', above!</p>
