      <h1>Laemmle Theatres Shutters Historic Music Hall, Takes Movie Chain off the Market</h1>
      <h2>The theater chain had reportedly been on the chopping block since the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:09:48+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/trey/" target="_blank">Trey Williams</a></address>
      <p>It looks like Los Angeles’s famed theater chain, Laemmle Theatres, isn’t up for sale after-all.</p>
      <p>Greg Laemmle, president of the 80-year-old family-owned exhibitor, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-11-21/laemmle-theatres-calls-off-sale-as-it-closes-music-hall-theatre">told the Los Angeles Times</a> this week that they ultimately decided the reward of continuing to own the theaters and show art-house films outweighed that of selling, and the risk that comes with owning indie theaters.</p>
      <p>“The market has improved, which gives us some flexibility on some level,” Laemmle told the L.A. Times. “I never thought what we were seeing was a fundamental change in audience’s interest in moviegoing.”</p>

      <p>Laemmle did, however, have to board up the doors to the more than 80-year-old Music Hall theater in Beverly Hills, which Laemmle has owned and operated for more than four decades.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.laemmle.com/theater/music-hall">a post on the theater’s website</a>, the theater operator said it’s possible for the theater, located at 9036 Wilshire Boulevard to experience a return to glory, but that if it happens “It will be after a hiatus and with different operators.”</p>
      <p>“It has been my family’s privilege to operate the Music Hall for 45 years but it’s time to end our stewardship,” Laemmle said in a statement on the company’s website. “For the sake of efficiency, we plan to use the other screens in our circuit to provide a platform for the types of films we’ve been showing in Beverly Hills.”</p>
      <p>Laemmle told the L.A. Times that through the first six months of 2019, the theater chain saw box office fall as much as 30%. He said business has improved in recent months, but they expect ticket sales to be down between 10% and 20% for the year.</p>

      <p>The theater chain’s struggles this year are indicative of the state that independently owned specialty cinemas find themselves.</p>
      <p>The challenges of smaller theaters have been exemplified by Landmark’s sale to Cohen Media Group at the tail end of 2018, as well as the shuttering of New York City’s last single-screen theater, the Paris Theatre, in August.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to react to short-term trends,” Laemmle told the Times. “But for us, something that goes on for more than six months becomes more than a short-term trend.”</p>
      <p>Laemmle’s theater circuit includes locations in Claremont, Glendale, Santa Monica, North Hollywood, Pasadena, West Los Angeles and Encino. And it runs with roughly 200 employees, including 60 to 70 full-time staff, according to the L.A. Times.</p>

          <figcaption><b>"It: Chapter Two" - Sept. 6 (New Line)  <br/></b>Andy Muschietti's first "It" film brought in $700.3 million worldwide on the back of a terrifying performance from Bill Skarsgård as the monster clown Pennywise. And the excitement of that film spurred the new film's A-list cast, including Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy and Bill Hader as grown-up members of The Losers Club. The sequel, though, clocks in at two hours and 49 minutes.<cite>Warner Bros./New Line</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Hustlers" - Sept. 13 (STX Entertainment)<br/></b>Look at those money moves. The impressive cast of pop star royalty behind “Hustlers,” including Jennifer Lopez, Cardi B and Lizzo, helps bring some hip hop attitude and style to the true story of a group of strip club dancers who swindled their clientele of often corrupt Wall Street brokers. Lorene Scafaria’s (“Seeking a Friend For the End of the World”) film is inspired by a New Yorker magazine article by Jessica Pressler, and the finished product is like if “Ocean’s 8” met “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Constance Wu, Julia Stiles, Keke Palmer and Lili Reinhart also star in the film.<cite>STX Entertainment</cite></figcaption>

His latest puts him into the sci-fi realm and pairs him with a cast that includes Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler and Donald Sutherland. The sweeping space scenes look impressive, but the film has been pushed back several times as a result of the Disney-Fox merger.<cite>20th Century Fox</cite></figcaption>

Rather than your typical superhero origin story, the backstory of the famed Batman villain stars Joaquin Phoenix as part of a larger character drama as he struggles with his career as a comedian and seeks acceptance in society. Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, Marc Maron, Shea Whigham and Brian Tyree Henry also star in the film that nods to Martin Scorsese cult favorites like "The King of Comedy."<cite>Warner Bros.</cite></figcaption>

Hawley's story is loosely inspired by the criminal activity of Lisa Nowak, an astronaut who was charged with the attempted kidnapping of a U.S. Air Force captain. Jon Hamm, Dan Stevens, Zazie Beetz, Nick Offerman, Ellen Burstyn and Tig Notaro also star in the drama.<cite>Fox Searchlight</cite></figcaption>

Banderas stars as a film director reflecting on his life choices, flashing back to his life as a young man and his relationship with his mother, played by Penélope Cruz, who owns the film in its early moments.<cite>Sony Pictures Classics</cite></figcaption>

But the star of the film is really the advanced CGI technology in which Smith also plays the de-aged version of himself. The filmmakers accomplished the feat in a different manner than the de-aging used on Samuel L. Jackson for "Captain Marvel," crafting an entire digital character based on a Will Smith that looks just like the Fresh Prince.<cite>Paramount Pictures</cite></figcaption>

A poor family of conmen pose as expert tutors and servants and swindle their way into cushy jobs with an eccentric and gullible rich family. But the film naturally has a devilish twist that helped win him the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival.<cite>Neon</cite></figcaption>

In the film directed by Joachim Rønning, Maleficent starts a battle after forbidding Aurora (Elle Fanning) from marrying a young prince. This time, Maleficent's war effort is helped by another race of dark, winged beasts led by Chiwetel Ejiofor.<cite>Disney</cite></figcaption>

The cast, particularly Stone, has exploded in stardom since the original's release, so a sequel now seems like a no-brainer.

It's an absurd premise, and the film's first teaser is a colorful romp featuring Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Rebel Wilson, Alfie Allen and Stephen Merchant.<cite>Fox Searchlight Pictures</cite></figcaption>

Relocating the neo-noir narrative to the 1950s in New York City, he plays a private detective with Tourette's Syndrome who finds himself ensnared in a citywide conspiracy at the hands of a master builder played by Alec Baldwin.

It's not just Arnold Schwarzenegger who's back, but also the original Sarah and John Connor, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong, who are fighting the war for humanity. "Deadpool" director Tim Miller should be more than equipped to make this an action spectacle.<cite>Kerry Brown for Skydance/Paramount</cite></figcaption>

It's a massive gangster throwback to Scorsese's heyday of "Goodfellas" and "Casino," bringing back Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel and even Joe Pesci out of retirement. It even pairs Al Pacino with Scorsese for what is incredibly the first time. But much of the film hinges on de-aging technology that makes De Niro and Pacino look decades younger in a saga about the man who claims he killed union boss Jimmy Hoffa.<cite>Netflix</cite></figcaption>

If you have the colorful direction and story of Elizabeth Banks and a whole lot of "wigs, toys, clothes" and exploding peppermints, it just might. Kristen Stewart looks like she's having a ball alongside Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska.

It's almost magical seeing Tom Hanks step into the shoes (and cardigan) of Fred Rogers for "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," which filmed on some of the original sets where "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" was produced for so many years.

The two are on the run for the killing of a police officer during a traffic stop gone wrong.

The World War II-era drama is just as spiritual and freeform as all his recent movies. But this one is based on the true story of an Austrian farmer named Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl), a conscientious objector who refused to fight for the Nazis.

          <figcaption><b>"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" - Dec. 20 (Disney)  <br/></b>"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker" marks the conclusion to the Skywalker saga and perhaps the set-up for what fans can expect from future big-screen trilogies from both the "Game of Thrones" showrunners and Rian Johnson. J.J. Abrams, back on board after directing "The Force Awakens," has already revealed that Emperor Palpatine is still threatening the galaxy. And he's teased that there's "<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jj-abrams-teases-theres-more-to-the-story-about-reys-parents-in-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">more to the story</a>" of Rey's parentage than Kylo Ren previously let on.<cite>Walt Disney Studios</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"Bombshell" - Dec. 20 (Lionsgate)  <br/></b>Director Jay Roach's look at the downfall of Fox News' Roger Ailes is told from the perspective of the women who accused him of sexual harassment. Margot Robbie stars as a fictional news producer at the cable news giant, while Charlize Theron plays Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman is Gretchen Carlson and John Lithgow is Ailes.

          <figcaption><b>"Little Women" - Dec. 25 (Sony)  <br/></b>There have been numerous film adaptations of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel, but the cast that director Greta Gerwig has assembled for her follow-up to "Lady Bird" is like the "Avengers" of awards season. Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern and Meryl Streep star in the story that's been updated to play on new gender norms, with a modern sensibility.<cite>Columbia Pictures</cite></figcaption>

          <figcaption><b>"1917" - Dec. 25 (Universal)  <br/></b>Not unlike "Dunkirk" from two years ago, "1917" tells the story of a heroic British military effort against the worst odds, but now the action has been relocated to World War I. Director Sam Mendes has assembled a cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch, Richard Madden, Colin Firth, Andrew Scott and George MacKay for this tense war epic.<cite>Universal</cite></figcaption>
