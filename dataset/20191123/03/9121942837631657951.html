      <p>BERLIN (AP) — Police in the western German city of Grevenbroich have asked about 900 men to come forward and have their DNA tested to help solve the gruesome killing of an 11-year-old girl some 23 years ago.</p>
      <p>The girl, Claudia Ruf, was kidnapped, raped and choked to death by an anonymous murderer in 1996. Her body was found in Euskirchen, 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Grevenbroich.</p>
      <p>German news agency dpa reported Saturday that 900 men, who were between 14 and 70 years old at the time of Ruf’s killing, have received invitations for a saliva swab test to have their DNA identified.</p>
      <p>Investigators already unsuccessfully tested some 350 men’s DNA in 2010. They say they now found new hints that could help them find the murderer by checking the 900 men.</p>
