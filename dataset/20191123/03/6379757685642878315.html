      <p>Speaking in Singida Region, Inspector of Tanzania Bureau of Standards Domisiano Rutahala said once sensitised the industrialists would certify their products hence access into any market which will improve economy of the country.</p>
      <p>He said the programme to educate entrepreneurs who own small industries on importance of certification started in Singida region and would be extended to other areas namely Manyoni, Kiomboi, Shelui, Mkalama and Singida municipal.</p>
      <p>“The exercise will also go to Itigi district council, where it has attracted some businesspersons who have already started to apply for certification of their products”, he said.</p>
      <p>Rutahala said for the past 16 days officials from TBS have been sensitising and educating owners of sunflower processing plants and maize processors in Singida on importance of mark of quality.</p>
      <p>“We are here to conduct this exercise and reach all industrialists and producers whose products are not certified to hear them and support them to reach required standards,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added; “most of them were happy when we approached them at their working premises and have responded well and pledged to convey the message to others so that they certify their products.”</p>
      <p>Rutahala said apart from education, they also conducted impromptu visits to cosmetics dealers and confiscated all banned products which threatens health of consumers.</p>
      <p>All the banned cosmetics were removed from the market because they pose a high risk to users including skin cancer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Singida Association of Processors chairman Juma Mene insisted on quality training for sunflower processors since they are facing a lot of challenges in obtaining a mark of quality from TBS.</p>
      <p>He said more efforts were needed to support producers in Central Corridor of Tanzania.</p>
      <p>He thanked officials from the standard watchdog for visiting manufacturers in their working premises and address their challenges.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Singida at the opening of the second SIDO national exhibition last month, Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa was quoted as urging manufacturers to cooperate with local and foreign certification agencies in attesting their goods to access market in Tanzania and beyond borders.</p>
      <p>“It is important for you to certify your goods the move will help you to access opportunities in local and foreign markets to sustain competition,” he said.</p>
