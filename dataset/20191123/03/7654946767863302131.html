      <p>SPOKANE, Wash. — Authorities say a Spokane Police officer has been arrested and accused of raping a female victim of a crime he was investigating.</p>
      <p>The Spokane County Sheriff’s Office says 36-year-old Nathan Nash was arrested Friday evening.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office says in October detectives opened an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct by Nash after the female spoke to authorities.</p>
      <p>The sheriff’s office says Spokane Police Department officials requested the investigation after her complaint.</p>
      <p>Nash has been booked into the Spokane County Jail on suspicion of second-degree rape and two counts of official misconduct.</p>
      <p>Spokane Police Chief Craig Meidl issued a statement Friday evening saying the alleged conduct is completely unacceptable and in absolute conflict with the high standards of the Spokane Police Department.</p>
