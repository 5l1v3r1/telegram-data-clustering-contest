      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/judiciary/federal-courts">federal judge</a> has ordered <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-teenager-senior-photos-killed-train-freight">Union Pacific</a> to reinstate an engineer who defecated on the exterior of a train car, according to media reports.</p>
      <p>The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Brian Buescher upholds an arbitration board's decision that Matthew Lebsack should be rehired following the 2016 incident, the <a href="https://journalstar.com/business/local/court-orders-up-to-reinstate-engineer-who-defecated-on-train/article_38f08a06-d096-5399-a273-c89f92b9f799.html?fbclid=IwAR2vx7exXy1Md9CRnnB_xnrO5KlY1GwJ1pdb4nY3cT1eAyS21GKHSxBgDFc">Lincoln Journal Star</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/nebraska">Omaha</a>-based railroad giant did not indicate whether it would appeal the ruling.</p>

      <p>"Union Pacific is reviewing the court’s decision and in the process of determining our next steps," the company said in a statement. "The behavior in question does not align with our values and should not be tolerated."</p>
      <p>Lebsack admitted to defecating on a portion of the train connecting a locomotive and boxcar during a Nov. 20, 2016 stop. He also admitted to throwing soiled tissues out a window and raising his middle finger at a security camera abord the train.</p>

      <p>The lawsuit also said he told his manager he left a "present" for his co-workers. The lawsuit didn't specify where the incident occurred.</p>
      <p>Lebsack later blamed the incident on physical and mental issues. The company terminated him, citing a rule prohibiting conduct that is "negligent, insubordinate, dishonest, immoral, quarrelsome or discourteous."</p>
      <p>In December, the arbitration board ruled the termination was excessive and said the railroad giant should require Lebsack to undergo a medical and psychological evaluation with the option to discipline him if he's found to not be fit for duty, according to the newspaper.</p>
      <p>Union Pacific filed a lawsuit defending its right to fire him.</p>

      <p>Buescher actually disagreed with the board, according to the newspaper, but said he wasn't allowed to consider the merits of the decision.</p>
      <p>He said Union Pacific failed to prove the arbitration decision was not within the board's discretion.</p>
