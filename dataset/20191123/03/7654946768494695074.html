      <h1>Thief swipes car with 2 kids in the backseat before crashing nearby</h1>

      <p>A thief stole a car in Queens with two children in the back seat — but the kids were quickly rescued with only minor injuries after he crashed into a tree in Brooklyn, police said.</p>
      <p>The suspect, whose name was not immediately released by police, swiped the car near Liberty Avenue and 92nd Street in Ozone Park at about 7:45 p.m., cops said.</p>
      <p>He likely didn’t know that two boys under the age of 10 were in the backseat — but he nonetheless took off, heading toward Brooklyn, cops said.</p>
      <p>The suspect soon lost control of the car and smashed into a tree on Norwood Avenue in Cypress Hills, police said.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said he was driving like a maniac, heading the wrong way down a one-way street before he crashed.</p>
      <p>“It was going very fast. It was like Grand Theft Auto,” Kenny Placencio, 27, who lives nearby, said.</p>
      <p>“He needs to be put in jail for a very long time,” Placencio added.</p>
      <p>Another witness, who declined to give his name, said the kids looked terrified when they were rescued by cops.</p>
      <p>“The kids were scared, man. They were screaming for their mother. They was lost,” the witness said.</p>
      <p>“Lock him up. Send him to Rikers Island. He can learn his lesson,” he added.</p>

      <p>The suspect was arrested at the scene and is being held at the 106 Precinct stationhouse, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The kids, who suffered minor injuries, were treated by first responders at the scene and reunited with their mother, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Charges against the car thief were pending.</p>
