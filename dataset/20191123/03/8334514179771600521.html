      <p>(Reuters) - Two-time Olympic gold medal-winning bobsledder Kaillie Humphries was officially named to the USA Bobsled National Team on Thursday, capping off the Calgary native’s long saga to be released from the Canadian squad.</p>
      <p>Humphries filed a lawsuit against Bobsleigh Canada in September in order to compete in the United States, after lodging a harassment complaint last year against the governing body, for whom she competed in three Olympic Games.</p>
      <p>Bobsleigh Canada freed her to compete in the States later that month, after a Calgary judge initially had blocked her bid.</p>
      <p>“Today I’m feeling that whole purpose driven warrior princess save the world type of vibe,” Humphries tweeted on Friday. “@TeamUSA @USABS it’s official.”</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, who most recently won bronze at the Pyeongchang Games, is based out of Carlsbad, California, and was named to the 2019-2020 team after winning trials, according to USA Bobsled and Skeleton.</p>
