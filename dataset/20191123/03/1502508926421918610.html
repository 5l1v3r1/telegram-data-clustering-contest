      <p>Senior Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi on Saturday expressed surprise at the political developments in Maharashtra and said the Congress-NCP-<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/shiv-sena">Shiv Sena </a>negotiations took too long as the window was grabbed by "fast movers".</p>
      <p>The month-long political impasse ended dramatically with <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/devendra-fadnavis">Devendra Fadnavis </a>returning as the chief minister again, backed by the Sharad Pawar-led NCP. NCP leader Ajit Pawar was sworn-in as the deputy chief minister at the Raj Bhavan.</p>
      <p>"Surreal wht I read about Maharashtra. Thought it was fake news. Candidly and personally speaking, our tripartite negotiations should not have gone on for more than 3 days...took too long. Window given was grabbed by fast movers. Pawarji tussi great ho," Singhvi tweeted.</p>
