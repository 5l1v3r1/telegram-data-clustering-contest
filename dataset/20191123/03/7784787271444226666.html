      <p>Holmes was a standout winger and fullback for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks of the National Rugby League. He headed to the United States for a chance to pursue his dream of playing American football in the NFL.</p>
      <p>Holmes had one year left on his contract with the Sharks, but instead had the team release him and passed up about $720,000.</p>
      <p>The official announcement from the Jets opens the soor for Holmes to sign with North Queensland for the 2020 NRL season and beyond, <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/nrl-2020-valentine-holmes-to-sign-for-north-queensland-cowboys-latrell-mitchell-contract-news-wests-tigers/news-story/a5e4b14796fd94a19abf4b13dc3216d1">according to the Courier Mail.</a> His contract at the Cowboys is set to be worth $1 million a season.</p>
      <p>“Joining the New York Jets has been an awesome experience, one I would never changed,” Holmes said, via his management agency.</p>
      <p>“I made personal and professional sacrifices to secure the opportunity to pull on the Jets helmet and uniform, I will live with no regrets around my decision to pursue an NFL career.</p>
      <p>“I will now take some time off to organise my things and sit down with my family and my agent on my return to Australia to discuss next steps.”</p>
      <p>The Cowboys have been showing fellow superstar Latrell Mitchell around in Townsville and dined with him on Monday night as the disgruntled Rooster explores his options.</p>
      <p>However, the club won’t be able fit both Holmes and Mitchell under the salary cap, meaning the Kangaroos centre looks almost certain to sign for Wests Tigers and take the No.1 jersey.</p>
      <p>The Tigers are are reportedly prepared to offer Mitchell a four-year, $4 million contract — and are prepared to grant him his wish to play fullback as the club’s marquee player.</p>
