      <p>Now 98 years old, he is still working and opens his surgery in the Paris suburbs two mornings a week for patients, some of whom he has treated for decades.</p>
      <p>With no health woes of his own - he doesn’t even wear glasses during his consultations - Chenay said a quiet retirement had no appeal.</p>
      <p>“If you’re over 60 they put you with the old people. One day you’ve got cards, the next day bingo, then there’s sudoku... With all that you become a complete idiot. I’m better off being a doctor!”</p>
      <p>Originally from Angers in western France, Chenay worked as a welder before becoming a doctor, ultimately qualifying as a radiologist before moving back into general practice.</p>
      <p>His surgery does not look high tech - there is a fax machine but no computer on the desk - but Chenay says he keeps up to date with all the latest developments via his subscriptions to online medical journals.</p>
      <p>He says a new development in his nearly seven-decade career is patients who erroneously diagnose themselves on the internet and then turn up at his surgery demanding drugs.</p>
      <p>Many of his patients say they struggle to get appointments in Chevilly-Larue, which has three doctors for a population of 19,000, so they queue early to see Chenay who runs a drop-in surgery, promising to see the first 20 patients who sign up.</p>
      <p>“(In France) we have the doctors, we have the sick people, but to bring the people together is really not easy,” he said.</p>
      <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has faced months of unrest from hospital workers angry about tough working conditions and underinvestment, and Chenay said he had never seen a worse crisis in the sector.</p>
      <p>The average retirement age for doctors in France is 67 and Chenay’s son, who also practiced as one, has already given up work.</p>
      <p>But Chenay does not see himself stopping.</p>
      <p>“If you sit and watch TV all day you switch off pretty quickly, your head doesn’t last long.”</p>
