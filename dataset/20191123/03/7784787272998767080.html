      <h3>Jamie Whincup topped a tense Race 31 qualifying session at the Coates Hire Newcastle 500, with the seven-time champion carrying over his Friday pace.</h3>
      <p>Whincup was just 0.05s faster then next-best Cameron Waters (#6 Monster Energy Mustang) after Friday’s Practice 2, but extended the margin on Saturday morning to 0.1270s over Anton De Pasquale (#99 Penrite Racing ZB Commodore).</p>
      <p>Waters was third in qualifying, but admitted there’s more in his car, specifically in the last sector – one of many gripes the drivers had in the 20-minute hitout.</p>

      <p>Red Bull Holden ace Whincup will be the last man out for the fight for pole on Saturday, and is in serious form, having dominated the season of endurance alongside Craig Lowndes.</p>
      <p>Teammate Shane van Gisbergen barely snuck into the Shootout, dropping the #97 into 10th, just 0.0448s ahead of 11th-placed Mark Winterbottom (#18 IRWIN Racin ZB Commodore).</p>
      <p>Fabian Coulthard outqualified champion teammate Scott McLaughlin, with the Kiwis fourth and eighth.</p>
      <p>Between the Ford duo were Lee Holdsworth (#5 The Bottle-O Racing Mustang), Tim Slade (#14 Freightline Racing ZB Commodore) and James Courtney (#22 Walkinshaw Andretti United ZB Commodore).</p>
      <p>David Reynolds (#9 Penrite Racing ZB Commodore) was nearly two tenths down on teammate De Pasquale, but was a scant 0.0252s ahead of van Gisbergen.</p>

      <p>Midway through the session, Scott Pye – <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/supercars/scott-pye-supercars-newcastle-2019-supercars-2019-supercars-news-newcastle-500/news-story/b78ad52828a07061116f632c62ef60e2">who missed Practice 2 on Friday due to illness </a>– crashed his #2 Walkinshaw Andretti United ZB Commodore at Turn 7. He managed to return to the lane, but the red flag and crash damage brought an early end to his session.</p>
      <p>Whincup reiterated the changing track and weather conditions continue to make running difficult.</p>
      <p>“It’s so difficult to get a real clean lap,” said Whincup.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think anyone maximised then, that just shows how difficult the track is. The conditions are forever changing every session as well.</p>
      <p>“We were confident, we went in early, did the best lap time we could and wasn’t sure halfway through the session if it was going to be good enough.</p>
      <p>“But at the end of it, it was.”</p>
      <p>The Top 10 Shootout will commence at 1:15pm AEDT ahead of the 95-lap Race 31 at 4:15pm.</p>
