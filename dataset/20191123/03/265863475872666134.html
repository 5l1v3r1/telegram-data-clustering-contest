      <h1>Kylie Jenner May Be Hanging Around Drake Just To Make Travis Scott Jealous A Source Claims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:47:17+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:47</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from BET.com, Kylie Jenner has been enjoying her life since moving on from the father of her child, Travis Scott. Reportedly, Kylie has been hanging around Drake just for fun following her split from the rapper.</p>
      <p>An insider who spoke with People Magazine stated that Kylie “doesn’t seem to be dating.” The source stated that Kylie has just been seeing Drake “occasionally,” however, it doesn’t seem that serious between them. Moreover, the source added Kylie may be hanging out with Drake just to make Travis jealous.</p>
      <p>It was reported earlier this year that Jenner and Scott chose to take some time off from each other, following two years of dating and also after the birth of their one child. With that said, they aren’t calling off their romance entirely.</p>
      <p>Ironically, their split came after they both posed together for Playboy. People Magazine reported there was a rift between Kylie and Travis earlier this year after it was rumored that Travis was cheating on her with another woman.</p>

      <p>Additionally, sources claim the stress and chaos of being a celebrity add fuel to the fire. E! News also reported that both Kylie and Travis agreed on the fact it may have been best to live separately so they could “let things cool down.”</p>
      <p>The insider who spoke with E! News stated that Kylie, however, has allowed Travis to see Stormi Webster as much as he wants, and would never take that right away from him. Additionally, TMZ claimed the couple hasn’t been spotted out publicly together since the premiere of his Look Mom, I Can Fly documentary on the 27th of August.</p>
      <p>Other fans noted that Scott and Jenner were not together at Justin and Hailey’s wedding earlier this year. Kylie reportedly did bring Stormi Webster, however, as her date. As it was previously reported, Jenner and Scott started dating officially for the world to see in April 2017. They met at Coachella.</p>
      <p>And just a few months later, she got pregnant and gave birth to their daughter, Stormi, in the following year.</p>
