      <p>The Mwanza-based club have lifted themselves off the foot of the table to 10th spot with two successive away victories in the Vodacom Premier League, a 1-0 victory over Police Tanzania and a 2-1 victory over Coastal Union.</p>
      <p>Former Azam FC striker, Waziri Junior Shentembo, will be the man to watch for Mbao FC as they seek to extend their unbeaten run to four games.</p>
      <p>Shentembo has rediscovered his form, having netted three goals in his last three matches for Mbao FC.</p>
      <p>Mbao, who were promoted to the domestic top flight soccer tournament in 2015/16, have never lost a game against Azam FC at CCM Kirumba Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mbao, however, will have to be at their very best as the visitors have set sight on winning a second successive match following their 2-1 victory over Biashara United before the international break.</p>
      <p>Azam FC, nicknamed ‘The Ice Cream makers’, are still very much in the title race as they have only played seven games in the league thus far compared to the nine outings log leaders Simba SC have had.</p>
      <p>Azam, the 2013/14 Mainland Premier League champions, have plenty of ground to make up though as they are nine points adrift but do have games to make up the points difference.</p>
      <p>Recently appointed Romanian tactician, Aristica Cioaba, knows Azam FC needs to win games against the so-called small teams if he is to survive the axe from his trigger happy bosses, who have fired 10 coaches in 10 seasons since 2008/9 season.</p>
      <p>Having lost two out of the three matches since his appointment, Cioaba knows there is little margin for error and even a draw will not be deemed good enough in this encounter as they try to keep Simba within sight.</p>
      <p>Azam FC has been placed 11th in this season’s league standing and the outfit’s assistant coach Iddi Cheche has insisted they have to win to return to where they belong and avoid another premature title race exit seen in the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>"We prepare to make sure every department is good enough, we have to be good in possession of the ball, in attacking, scoring, finishing and other things. We have always belonged in the top four and we need to make sure we return to where we belong,’’ Cheche explained ahead of the match.</p>
