      <p>Much has been said about the pink cricket ball and its behaviour and on Friday it was put to the test. Did it behave differently than the red or white? "It's a different ball game," many a cricketer had been heard saying.</p>
      <p>TOI takes a look at the ball in various shades of pink:</p>
      <p>
        <b>AFTERNOON</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first 15 overs, when the ball was still relatively new, it swung quite a lot, but only after the first 20-odd minutes. Initially, the Indian bowlers were making it seam. In fact, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammed Shami</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a> were making the ball dart in, in the early overs and that seemed to trouble the Bangladesh batsmen more. The bounce was quite good and the generous sprinkling of grass on the pitch probably had more to do with it than the ball itself. As the shine wore off a bit, the pacers started getting big swing. It tested the reflexes and keeping skills of stumper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/wriddhiman-saha">Wriddhiman Saha</a> too, a test he came out passing with flying colours.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TWILIGHT ZONE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first signs that fielding could be a problem during the twilight minutes were seen when the last Bangladesh wicket fell. It was just after 4.30 pm and the floodlights had started to marry the slanting rays of the sun. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abu-Jayed">Abu Jayed</a> edged Mohammed Shami to <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> at slip, but the opener failed to pick it. It could have travelled faster than anticipated as it bounced off his palm and luckily for India, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cheteshwar-Pujara">Cheteshwar Pujara</a> held on to it. However, Sharma was left searching for the ball. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> had spoken of the hardness of the ball and Sharma seemed to agree as he kept shaking his hand.</p>
      <p>The Indian batsmen, however, seemed to be hardly troubled by the tricky twilight period as they went after the Bangladesh bowling. One chance that <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Al-Amin-Hossain">Al-Amin Hossain</a> got off a Rohit Sharma skier was grassed in the deep. Was it the deceptive dip perception that Kohli had talked about?</p>
      <p>
        <b>EVENING</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the second interval, the ground staff combed the ground with thick ropes to mop up the dew. The curator was taking no chances. Sharma shouldered arms to a delivery that came in indicating that he wasn't sure of his off-stump, another point that Kohli had alluded to. As the evening wore on, the ball as well as the Bangladesh bowlers seemed to lose bite as Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara started to make batting look easy.</p>
