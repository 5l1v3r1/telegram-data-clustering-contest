      <p>DENVER — Celtics guard Kemba Walker collided with teammate Semi Ojeleye late in the second quarter, striking Ojeleye’s abdomen area head-first and going down on to the court in a heap in a 96-92 loss to the Nuggets on Friday night.</p>
      <p>In a tweet, the Celtics said Walker has been diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms. The Bronx native, who starred on Connecticut’s 2011 national championship team, was taken to a hospital for further evaluation and was later released, according to the team.</p>
      <p>Celtics coach Brad Stevens told reporters after the game that he didn’t have an update on Walker’s status, but that the scans Walker underwent at halftime yielded good results.</p>
      <p>“I saw him in the ambulance at halftime that took him to the hospital, and he was — he had his wherewithal, and in pretty decent spirits, which was good, obviously,” Stevens said.</p>
      <p>Walker grimaced in pain as he went down and play was stopped as medical personnel from both teams tended to the star guard who was prone on the floor for several minutes.</p>
      <p>His teammates gathered round as did Nuggets players, plainly concerned about Walker. A brace was placed around his neck to stabilize the area and he was strapped to a backboard before being placed onto a gurney and wheeled off the court.</p>
      <p>“It’s tough on both teams to see that,” Stevens said of the impact the injury had on the rest of the game. “And it was good to get at least early reports of good news from our standpoint. But the head injury thing is super-scary, and — so you’re always thinking about it, and you still have to play the last 27 minutes, which is — not a fun part of it, but I thought our guys and Denver competed really hard the rest of the game.”</p>
      <p>Walker entered the game averaging a team-leading 22.6 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 4.8 assists in his first season with Boston.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the Celtics lost Gordon Hayward to a fractured left hand. He suffered the injury when he collided with LaMarcus Aldridge in a Nov. 9 game against San Antonio.</p>
