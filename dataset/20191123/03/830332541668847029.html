      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Gov. Tony Evers has signed a bill that defines autocycles in state law and establishes registration fees for the vehicles.</p>
      <p>Autocycles are three-wheeled vehicles that seat one or two people.</p>
      <p>The Republican-authored bill defines autocycles as vehicles with three wheels in contact with the ground, seating that doesn't require straddling and a steering wheel. The bill establishes a $45 annual registration fee.</p>
      <p>Evers signed the bill privately Friday.</p>
      <p>According to a state Department of Transportation estimate, 1,030 vehicles that fit the autocycle definition are currently registered in Wisconsin as motorcycles for a $23 biennial fee. That fee generates about $11,845 annually.</p>
      <p>The department projects it will cost about $160,000 to re-program computers to implement the $45 fee and create autocycle license plates. The new fee should generate about $46,350 annually.</p>
