      <p>diseases including cancer.</p>
      <p>The researcher revealed this at the university during a meeting that discussed strategic policy in reducing the use of pesticides to human health and the environment when presenting her research findings.</p>
      <p>She explained that factory-made pesticides have been in use in the country since 1945 and were brought for trial basis by World Health Organisation (WHO) and that many of them are hazardous especially to children due to their weak resistance to them.</p>
      <p>She cited other society groups who are adverse affected as pregnant women due to their body chemistry, as well as older people.</p>
      <p>She also said the pesticides also degrade the environment especially in rivers, lakes, fish, soil, air, homes and hotels and contribute to non-communicable diseases due the chemicals that accumulates for very long times before causing havoc through bacteria living in vegetables that are sprayed with the pesticides while in the farm.</p>
      <p>She cited another group that faces such hazards includes small farmers and children who are employed in crop spraying in farms without protective gears.</p>
      <p>Ag MUHAS Vice Principal Prof Rose Mpembeni said the research was done in the period of five years in partnership with University of Bergensis in Norway, University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and was funded by the Norwegian government.</p>
      <p>Some of the discussions’ participants including Members of Parliament for Bahi, (Omar Badwel) and Biharamulo (Oscar Mwapasa) advised on how MUHAS can cooperate with sectoral ministries to attain targeted goals through the research.</p>
      <p>Senior Programme Officer from AGENDA – a non governmental Organisation Dorah Swai said apart from the good results of the research it is advisable for the concerned authorities to adopt the habit of monitoring the use of the pesticides so that other users should adhere to their appropriate use.</p>
