      <h3>Highlights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The pink ball wasn't really doing much at the beginning, at least not enough to trouble any international batsman.</li>
        <li>When the ball started doing things, Bangladesh were caught napping.</li>
        <li>Indian batsmen added salt to injury, passing the Bangladesh score for the loss of just the openers.</li>

      <p>KOLKATA: India did not have to wait for twilight to wreak havoc. Their pacers did that much earlier, even before the sun had started setting for the day. The first-ever day-night Test in the country got off to contrasting starts for the competing teams - a dream one for the hosts and a nightmare for Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>

      <p>In fact, it turned out to be quite an eventful day, with two concussion substitutes being called upon on the same day for the first time in history. Bangladesh's Liton Das and Nayeem Hasan had to be replaced by Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Taijul Islam, respectively, after they were hit by a fiery <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammed-shami">Mohammed Shami</a>.</p>

      <p>Even though it was expected to be a no-contest, Bangladesh being dismissed for 106 in less than three hours was something not many would have predicted. At 73 for 6 in the first session, Bangladesh batting had been buried in broad daylight.</p>
      <p>Indian batsmen added salt to injury, passing the Bangladesh score for the loss of just the openers. Eventually, they ended the day at 174 for three to be firmly in control. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Cheteshwar-Pujara">Cheteshwar Pujara</a> (55) continued his love affair with the pink ball, scoring yet another half-century before edging Ebadat Hossain. Skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> crossed the 5,000-run mark as Test captain, remaining unbeaten on 59. The duo added 94 for the third wicket, making batting look like an evening stroll.</p>

      <p>Mayank Agarwal, who tried to steer the ball past point only to edge, would want to play the shot differently on another day. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rohit-Sharma">Rohit Sharma</a> might have read the line wrong as he shouldered arms to Hossain to be adjudged leg before.</p>
      <p>The pink ball wasn't really doing much at the beginning, at least not enough to trouble any international batsman. When the ball started doing things, Bangladesh were caught napping.</p>

      <p>Early on, it was the bounce that the visitors seemed to be having trouble with as the pace trio of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ishant-sharma">Ishant Sharma</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/umesh-yadav">Umesh Yadav</a> and Shami relished the track and sent ominous messages to the rivals. They combined to grab all 10 wickets (there was only one over of spin), with veteran Ishant picking his 10th five-wicket haul in Tests.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina must have been left disappointed with the cricketers' performance after she and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee rang the ceremonial bell to set the Test rolling.</p>

      <p>The way Shami, Yadav and Ishant breathed fire, the pink ball, twilight or dew would never have been factors. Yet, the focus was always on the ball and not the batsmen. The first signs of prodigious swing was spotted in the highly-eventful seventh over, bowled by Ishant. Bangladesh opener Imrul Kayes had a caught-behind decision overturned on review before letting go a big swinging delivery. Ishant then had one cut back into Kayes with his next ball and this time, the opener lost the review. First of five for Ishant.</p>
      <p>The packed stadium was waiting for local boy Mohammed Shami and welcomed him as the first change by chanting his name. The pacer extracted pace, bounce and movement off the seam as well as in the air. Some of his deliveries moved so much that he had Wriddhiman Saha diving on both sides. That was the beginning of a torrid day for the wicketkeeper, who came up with a commendable performance, which included an excellent catch to dismiss <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahmudullah">Mahmudullah</a>. That a couple slipped past him to the boundary was no fault of his.</p>

      <p>However, it was Umesh who triggered the Bangladesh slide with the first over of his second spell. First, Rohit Sharma at slip dived to pouch a brilliant catch off a delivery that angled in to Mominul Haque before straightening. Then, the bowler made one cut into Mohammad Mithun to castle him.</p>
      <p>Kohli piled on the pressure with an intimidating slip cordon - sometimes three, mostly four and briefly even five. Not for the first time, his pace troika responded brilliantly.</p>
