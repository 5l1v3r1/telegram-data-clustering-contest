      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/bos/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> point guard <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6479/kemba-walker">Kemba Walker</a> has been diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms after being stretchered from the court late in the second quarter of Friday night's game in Denver. He was transported to a local hospital for further evaluation, the team announced.</p>
      <p>Walker ran head-first into the abdomen area of teammate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3056602/semi-ojeleye">Semi Ojeleye</a> and immediately went to the floor. Early indications are that Walker did not suffer a significant injury in the collision, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.</p>
      <p>Walker grimaced in pain as he went down and play was stopped as medical personnel from both teams tended to the star guard, who was on the floor for several minutes.</p>
      <h3>Walker leaves game on stretcher after collision with teammate</h3>
      <p>Kemba Walker collides with teammate Semi Ojeleye and falls to the court. He would leave the game on a stretcher.</p>
      <p>Walker's teammates gathered around, as did Nuggets players. A brace was placed around his neck to stabilize the area and he was strapped to a backboard before being placed onto a gurney and wheeled off the court.</p>
      <p>Walker, 29, entered the game averaging a team-leading 22.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 4.8 assists in his first season with Boston.</p>
