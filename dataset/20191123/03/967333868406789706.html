      <h1>‘Share It With the World’: New Mobile App Allows Users to Make Selfies From Outer Space</h1>

      <p>The new app, which was given the name Spelfie, captures images of users using almost 50 Airbus Earth-observation satellites that are circling around our planet over the height of 400 miles (643 km), <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7712419/App-snaps-selfies-world-using-satellite-cameras.html?ito=social-twitter_mailonline">according to the Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>Images taken by the app do not feature a close view of the user’s face. The app is designed to snap a wider view of event such as climate protest.</p>
      <p>For example, activist Isabel Wijsen, a member of an environmental movement called Bye-Bye Plastic Bags, was attending a rally against plastic pollution on the island of Bali in Indonesia and she used Spelfie <a href="https://sputniknews.com/art_living/201705311054140686-sputnik-app-launches-spief/">app to take a picture of the event</a>, where activists spelled out words ‘ACT NOW’ on a polluted beach.</p>

      <blockquote>“Spelfie is a movement of people who want to change the world and make a difference. The power of a spelfie can help raise awareness globally, encouraging others to join in and want to make a difference too. Just take a selfie and share it with the world… show them that you were there,” read the <a href="https://www.spelfie.com/about">description of the new app</a> on the official website.</blockquote>
      <p>Users of <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201706041054293567-christine-beerli-icrc-aleppo-app-fresh-water/">the app can confirm</a> their willingness to attend a registered event in the app and during the event can take selfies using the app. Satellites cameras will take snaps of the event according to a specified place and time.</p>
