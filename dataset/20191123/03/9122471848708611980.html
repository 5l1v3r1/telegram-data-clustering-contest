      <p>Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker suffered a terrifying injury in the first half of this evening’s game against the Denver Nuggets. Walker had to be strapped onto a stretcher and carried off of the floor.</p>
      <p>Walker, who signed with Boston this offseason, suffered an apparent injury when he collided with teammate Semi Ojeleye.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old point guard was chasing down a loose ball with his head down when he ran into Ojeleye straight on. It was a football-like collision. Walker was down on the floor for a while, surrounded by teammates, before being carried off.</p>
      <p>It was an extremely scary scene.</p>
