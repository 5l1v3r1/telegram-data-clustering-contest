      <p>Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari administered the oath to the two in the morning ceremony, where only official media was present.</p>
      <p>"People had given us a clear mandate, but Shiv Sena tried to ally with other parties after results, after which President's rule was imposed. Maharashtra needed a stable govt not a 'khichidi' govt," Fadnavis said.</p>
      <p>Ajit Pawar, after taking oath as the deputy chief minister, said: "From result day on October 24, no party was able to form the government. Maharashtra was facing many problems, including farmers issues. So we decided to form a stable government."</p>
