      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday told United Russia to take initiative rather than wait for his lead as the ruling party struggles to overcome plummeting popularity after a long period of political dominance.</p>
      <p>Putin addressed the annual convention of the party, which is widely seen as a rubber-stamp for the Kremlin and analysts say often takes the heat for any unpopular government decisions.</p>
      <p>United Russia, which was established in 2001 and turns 18 next weekend, has been a legislative powerhouse, enjoying a constitutional majority in the parliament's lower house since 2007.</p>
      <p>But the public's desire for change is growing, and the crisis has led to members trying to avoid the party's name in elections.</p>
      <p>On Saturday Putin called on delegates to take the lead and be "with the people".</p>
      <p>"I ask you to be leaders. Find and raise difficult questions without waiting for my annual phone-in," the president said, referring to the marathon television session he holds with Russians who complain about crumbling infrastructure or unresponsive local officials.</p>
      <p>However he praised the party for "not shunning difficult decisions," likely referring to the recent reform hiking the state pension age, for which United Russia took the brunt of criticism.</p>
      <p>- 'Party of crooks and thieves' -</p>
      <p>Such unpopular reforms and mounting economic troubles have led the party's rating to collapse to a record low of 32.2 percent this year.</p>
      <p>Putin usually distances himself from United Russia, and his spokesman this week reiterated that although the president would address the convention, he is not its leader.</p>
      <p>That role has been delegated to Putin's loyal lieutenant, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev.</p>

      <p>United Russia has become so toxic that even ranking members chose to run as independents in local polls in September, earning a rebuke on Saturday from party chairman Medvedev, who chastised them for "confusing voters".</p>
      <p>Medvedev also urged the party to "renew" itself before the next elections and become "invincible for political opponents" by the 2021 parliamentary polls.</p>
      <p>"We are preparing for a difficult campaign on all levels of the government," he said, complaining of "dirty" and "unfair" tactics used by opponents to attack United Russia.</p>
      <p>For Russia's opposition, the party has been associated with corruption and extreme bureaucracy.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Alexei Navalny has made it his mission to destroy United Russia, calling it the "party of crooks and thieves" in 2011 -- a phrase that continues to stick at every election campaign.</p>
      <p>- Putin's 'lightning rod' -</p>
      <p>Unlike in many other countries, where the ruling party typically forms the government, United Russia does not make independent decisions and only rubber-stamps Kremlin and government initiatives.</p>
      <p>"Its major task is to control parliament, but between elections, there is no need for the party, as its role in parliament is purely technical," said political analyst Tatiana Stanovaya.</p>
      <p>It is basically a "department of the Kremlin administration," the head of the R.Politik analysis firm told AFP.</p>
      <p>Konstantin Kalachev, who heads the Political Expert Group think tank, said the party also serves as a "lightning rod" for criticism of the authorities, deflecting heat from Putin himself.</p>
      <p>In the eyes of the voters, "the party takes responsibility for all the sins of the authorities," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Not a single candidate including the head of the party's Moscow branch, Andrei Metelsky, ran on the United Russia ticket in the Moscow city parliament polls and even state-controlled pollsters indicate Russians' fatigue with its dominance.</p>
      <p>Fifty-one percent of respondents said they believe the ruling party should "periodically change," state pollster VTsIOM said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Stanovaya said that the Kremlin understands the party "needs to be rescued", stressing however that the authorities were "underestimating the situation".</p>
      <p>But major party reforms are hardly possible as Russia's political establishment is being kept in the dark about Putin's plans beyond 2024, when his fourth Kremlin term ends, observers say.</p>
      <p>Such questions were not expected to be answered at Saturday's convention.</p>
      <p>"Nobody understands how the government structure will change, whether Putin will stay or go, and what United Russia's place will be in the system," Stanovaya said.</p>
