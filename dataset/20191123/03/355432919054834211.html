      <h1>DOJ urges Supreme Court to side with Trump in ongoing legal battle over tax returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-23T03:19:57+00:00">23 Nov 2019, 03:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/jessica-campisi" target="_blank">Jessica Campisi</a></address>
      <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday urged the Supreme Court to side with <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> in his ongoing legal battle over the release of his tax returns.</p>
      <p>The DOJ in a brief filed Friday called on the Supreme Court to hear Trump’s appeal to block a subpoena from Manhattan prosecutors who are demanding that his accounting firm release eight years of his financial records, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/us/trump-tax-records-justice.html">The New York Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The brief, filed by Solicitor General Noel Francisco, says allowing Manhattan prosecutor Cyrus Vance to obtain the tax returns would create a precedent that “may subject the president to highly burdensome demands for information” and “raises the risk that prosecutors could use subpoenas to harass the president as a result of opposition to his policies,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-trump-taxes/justice-department-backs-trump-in-supreme-court-fight-over-his-tax-returns-idUSKBN1XX00E?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;utm_source=reddit.com">Reuters reports</a>.</p>
      <p>“The United States has a substantial interest in protecting the office of the president and the powers and duties vested in that office,” the brief reportedly reads. “The United States also has a substantial interest in protecting the autonomy of the federal government from potential interference by the states.”</p>
      <p>The brief did not say Trump is immune from criminal investigation while in office, but did say that courts should require prosecutors to meet a higher standard, the Times notes.</p>
      <p>The filing comes a week after Trump <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/470532-trump-appeals-to-supreme-court-to-keep-tax-returns-from-ny">appealed to the high court</a> asking it to reverse a court order requiring his accountants to hand over his tax returns, marking a drastic escalation of his ongoing fight to keep his financial records private.</p>
      <p>A week before that, a federal appeals court in New York said Manhattan prosecutors could enforce a subpoena against the president’s accounting firm, Mazars USA, for his personal and corporate financial records between 2011 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The Supreme Court is set to announce in the coming weeks whether it will hear the Manhattan case and a second case regarding a subpoena from a House committee, the Times reports.</p>
