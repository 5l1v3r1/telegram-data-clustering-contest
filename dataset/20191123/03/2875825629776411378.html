      <h2>Girls Aloud bandmates Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts have said they never plotted in group chat to make Nadine Coyle eat 'turkey testicles' on I'm A Celebrity</h2>

      <p>Nadine Coyle is not being set up to 'eat turkey testicles' on I'm A Celebrity by her former Girls Aloud bandmates.</p>
      <p>After reports appeared in The Sun that Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts had been plotting in a group WhatsApp chat, to ensure Nadine was nominated for a Bushtucker Trial in the jungle, the Girls Aloud stars have refuted the claims.</p>
      <p>They have taken offence at the idea they have been "voting repeatedly" so that Nadine is faced with something nasty.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the MailOnline, Nadine's former bandmates have spoken out against the claims of a source, with Cheryl insisting they "have love for each other", even if they have had differences in opinion.</p>

      <p>Cheryl said: "We only want to see Nadine do well, and regardless of any differences we might have had, we will always all have love for each other.</p>
      <p>"We did not enjoy watching her distressed when jumping out of the plane. And we don’t have time for group chats regarding the trials on the show!"</p>
      <p>Kimberley also dismissed the claim and that when Nadine jumped from the helicopter in the launch episode, her heart went out to her.</p>

      <p>She said: "I felt really emotional watching Nadine jump out of the plane and texted Cheryl saying how hard it was to watch. I think she’s doing great in there."</p>
      <p>This was echoed by Nicola Roberts, who also slammed the reports that the Girls Aloud singers were hoping for bad things to happen to Nadine in the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>She also dismissed reports that there was a private group chat where they tear into Nadine behind her back.</p>
      <p>Nicola said: 'We don’t have a group chat about I’m A Celebrity, this just isn’t true. We only wish Nadine the best in the jungle and hope she does well on the show.'</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the band also said the reports were "fabricated", telling MailOnline: "This story is completely fabricated and made up.</p>

      <p>"Cheryl, Nicola and Kimberley have not been 'plotting' to get Nadine to do trials in I’m A Celebrity. To suggest they have been is quite frankly ridiculous."</p>
      <p>There had been rumours that Nadine and Cheryl had a longstanding disagreement but Nadine denied this when asked about by Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
