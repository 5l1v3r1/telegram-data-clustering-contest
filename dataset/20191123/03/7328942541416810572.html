      <p>South Korean automaker Hyundai has signed a deal with the city of Seoul, South Korea, to begin a pilot program to test autonomous vehicles on city streets beginning in December of this year.</p>
      <h3>Hyundai and Seoul, South Korea, to begin testing of autonomous vehicles on city streets by year's end</h3>
      <p><i>BusinessKorea</i> <a href="http://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=38344">is reporting</a> this week that Hyundai Motor Group and the city of Seoul, South Korea have signed a memorandum of understanding that will begin a pilot program to test <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/most-americans-are-terrified-of-getting-in-a-self-driving-car">autonomous vehicles</a> on the city's streets, starting in <b>December</b>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to the agreement, the city is to provide traffic signaling and road infrastructures necessary for autonomous vehicles to navigate city streets while <b>Hyundai</b> will test <b>6 autonomous, hydrogen-electric cars</b> as soon as next month. The pilot program will expand to include at least<b> 15 autonomous cars</b> in the year <b>2021</b>.</p>
      <p>The program will be initially restricted to <b>23 roads</b> in the <b>Gangnam district</b> of the city and the city will provide updated traffic information and other data to the vehicles through the city's mobile communications network approximately once <b>every 0.1 seconds.</b> Hyundai's <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/self-driving-cars-could-lead-to-more-traffic-not-less">autonomous vehicles</a> will then use that information to safely navigate the city's downtown area.</p>
      <p>The two hope to expand this system to other interested parties in order to further develop the technology through collaboration. Together, Hyundai and Seoul are hoping to have a fully-operable self-driving infrastructure in place throughout downtown Seoul by <b>2024</b>.</p>
