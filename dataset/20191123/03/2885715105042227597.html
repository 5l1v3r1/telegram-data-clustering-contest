      <p>In our series Streaming Guide, we list the works of a filmmaker or actor which are available on streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Eros Now and YouTube among more.</p>
      <p>This edition features Bollywood filmmaker Anees Bazmee whose Pagalpanti released on Friday. So, before you plan to catch up on some ‘pagalpanti’ in theaters, here is where you can watch his other comedy films like No Entry, Singh Is Kinng, Welcome, Ready and others.</p>
      <h3>Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: Hotstar</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kajol/">Kajol</a>, Ajay Devgn, Om Puri</b>
      </p>

      <p>It was fun to watch Kajol’s bubbly character Sanjana who is scared of sitting in the aeroplane and keeps dropping things in 1998 release Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha. She shared screen space with husband Ajay Devgn in the movie and watching them together in the rom-com was the icing on the cake. This feel-good family entertainer can be watched any time of the day.</p>
      <h3>No Entry</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: Netflix</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/salman-khan/">Salman Khan</a>, Fardeen Khan, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bipasha-basu/">Bipasha Basu</a>, Lara Dutta, Anil Kapoor, Celina Jaitley</b>
      </p>

        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypSSrlyi5RQ" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>

      <p>Don’t search for logic in No Entry. The movie is packed with gags and punches which make even its reruns a welcome break from all other serious stuff offered to you on television. It is a story of three men who seek happiness outside their marriage. The songs and dance sequences make it a complete masala entertainer.</p>
      <h3>Welcome</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: YouTube, ZEE5</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/akshay-kumar/">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/katrina-kaif/">Katrina Kaif</a>, Anil Kapoor, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nana-patekar/">Nana Patekar</a>, Paresh Rawal, Mallika Sehrawat, Feroz Khan</b>
      </p>
      <figure>

      <p>Another nonsensical comedy from brand Anees Bazmee, Welcome had Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif headlining the ensemble cast. Despite a typical Bollywood-ish plot–an innocent man falls in love with the sister of gangsters, but his uncle does not approve of their marriage until the girl’s brothers become gentlemen–Welcome is a fun watch. The credit for it goes to the terrific comic timing of Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar and Paresh Rawal.</p>
      <h3>Sing Is Kinng</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: Jio Cinema, iTunes</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Om Puri, Sonu Sood, Javed Jaffery, Kirron Kher, Neha Dhupia</b>
      </p>

      <p>The underworld has been one of Bollywood’s favourite themes, but Anees Bazmee used it for comic relief. Akshay Kumar as a do-gooder Sardar named Happy Singh left the audience rolling in laughter when he became the king of the Australian underworld. Don’t expect much of a plot. Stream it only for some happy times.</p>

      <h3>Ready</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: YouTube, Netflix</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: Salman Khan, Asin, Mahesh Manjrekar, Sudesh Lahri, Arya Babbar, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/puneet-issar">Puneet Issar</a>, Manoj Joshi, Paresh Rawal</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Take a break from the humdrum life and stream Salman Khan starrer Ready. You might be a fan of Dabangg Khan’s action, but after watching Ready, you will know he is even better in comedy films.</p>
      <h3>Welcome Back</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: ZEE5</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/john-abraham/">John Abraham</a>, Anil Kapoor, Nana Patekar, Paresh Rawal, Shruti Haasan, Dimple Kapadia, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/naseeruddin-shah/">Naseeruddin Shah</a></b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_EPPfT7qkKM" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Not as funny as Welcome, Welcome Back is entertaining only in parts. It lacks the quirk of Akshay Kumar, and the focus is more on the grandeur of its sets, instead of story or chemistry between the characters.</p>
      <h3>Mubarakan</h3>
      <h4>Streaming on: YouTube, Netflix</h4>
      <p>
        <b>Cast: Anil Kapoor, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arjun-kapoor/">Arjun Kapoor</a>, Athiya Shetty, Ileana D’Cruz, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/karan-kundra">Karan Kundra</a>, Neha Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah, Sanjay Kapoor</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2ll4IA146YI" width="640" height="360" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>How troublesome can it be to fix the marriage of twin brothers? What mess can be created if the girls they love get exchanged? Anil Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor starrer is a situational comedy which is funny only if you keep logic at bay.</p>
